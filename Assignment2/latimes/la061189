I am hard-pressed to express my dismay and anger over the brutality so 
graphically depicted in the May 12th episode of "Beauty and the Beast." Our 
family used to love the show for its depth of human compassion and peaceful 
problem solving. What happened? Perhaps kindness and ingenuity don't win 
ratings wars?

It's tacky, tacky, tacky for NBC to show the preempted episodes of "Miami Vice" 
after the series-ending episode on May 21. This is like the Dodgers playing 
rained-out games after the World Series! Like George Bush giving campaign 
speeches after the election! Like "The Winds of War" showing the last episode 
before the middle episodes! 
</P>
<P>
It's very thoughtless of NBC to show "Miami Vice" out of sequence. And it's not 
very nice. "Miami Vice" used to be a big hit for NBC and it's a shame the 
network is letting the show go out in a schlocky fashion.

FASHION: DRESSED TO SELF-EXPRESS; 
</P>
<P>
PETER SELLARS, L.A.'S NEWEST MUSE, GOES EAST/WEST TO CREATE AN ECLECTIC 
PERSONAL STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE, Mary Rourke is The Times' fashion editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can an East Coast preppie-turned-opera-director, who looks to Asia for artistic 
inspiration, find true happiness in Southern California? Peter Sellars seems to 
think so. And he's already dressing the part. 
</P>
<P>
Having burst on the scene as director of the Kennedy Center stage in Washington 
a few years ago at age 27, Sellars has spent the past five years directing 
opera productions around the world. On the strength of his unorthodox approach 
to the arts, Sellars was hired last year to oversee the 1990 Los Angeles Arts 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Since last fall, when he unpacked his dozens of opera tapes and books, settled 
into a Westwood apartment and started teaching theater arts at UCLA, Sellars 
has done nothing to adapt his unconventional life style to Southern California. 
He doesn't drive a car or own a telephone. "Watching people is what I do for my 
work," he says of traveling by bus. "And if I had a phone, I'd never get 
anything done." 
</P>
<P>
He has learned Los Angeles as few people do, but the charmingly eccentric 
Sellars is most interested in what he calls the detours. For instance, he feels 
more at home in a Koreatown coffee shop than a Beverly Hills restaurant, and 
his favorite hangout is the Discovery Room at the Natural History Museum of Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
For a visit there one recent afternoon, he wore a characteristic East-meets-Far 
East outfit, built around a billowing, pink Oxford-cloth shirt and a short, 
kimono-like Japanese happi coat. "Clothes interest me," he says. "Not fashion 
or costumes, but how people define themselves through clothes." 
</P>
<P>
His eclectic wardrobe seems appropriate for a man who once staged Mozart's 
"Cosi Fan Tutte" in a Vietnamese diner in Ipswich, Mass., and "The Marriage of 
Figaro" in Manhattan's Trump Towers. "Brooks Brothers shirts are the main 
ingredient," he explains. "But from there, the additions get increasingly 
alarming." 
</P>
<P>
At home, rummaging through a satchel that looks exactly like a yellow potato 
sack half-packed with neatly folded shirts and jackets, Sellars identifies each 
item by the country where he found it. "Happi coat from Japan, suit from 
Thailand, shirts from Borneo." The Brooks Brothers element in his wardrobe is a 
holdover from Harvard and Andover, his alma maters. "I love the big, bulky 
American cut," he says of the shirts. His hair style dates from school days, 
too. He cuts it himself -- "usually about 4 o'clock in the morning in a hotel 
room" -- to look like blond porcupine quills. "It's always very exciting to see 
what I'll come out with," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For all his quirky fashion tastes, Sellars wears expensive, black designer 
suits to corporate board meetings that can lead to financing for his costly 
artistic endeavors. But as an alternative to black tie, even at 
corporate-hosted events, he prefers formal Japanese silk kimonos. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't prepared to say exactly what he has planned for the upcoming Arts 
Festival, scheduled for September, 1990, at many locations around Southern 
California and modeled after the '84 Olympic Arts Festival. He sees it as 
having international scope, with strong representation from the Orient. 
"Afterward, I think people will say, 'Oh, I get it, that's what he's talking 
about,' " Sellars predicts. Once the festival is over, he says, "I hope to 
spend most of my time in Los Angeles. But I do expensive productions. I hope 
the city can support my work."

LOOKS: MAN POWER; 
</P>
<P>
AS MEN'S INTEREST IN PERSONAL APPEARANCE GROWS, SO DO THEIR GROOMING OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

YOUNG BUSINESSMEN in Tokyo are already flocking to grooming counters for tinted 
foundations and mascara. Men here aren't as adventurous, however -- only 14% 
will even admit to using a moisturizer. Although makeup may not yet get the 
stamp of approval from the average U.S. male, improving his looks does. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, tens of thousands of men turned to cosmetic surgeons to shrink 
potbellies and love handles, lift sagging jowls, add more hair and repair other 
cosmetic problems. In Los Angeles, facialists have reported a 20% increase in 
male clientele over the past year. And cosmetics manufacturers, determined to 
convince men that "good grooming" means more than just a close shave, use 
commercial holidays such as Father's Day to promote new forms of toiletries. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study suggests that their message is getting across. Conducted by 
psychologist Stephen Franzoi at Marquette University, the research indicated 
that 44% of American men say they spend more time each day on grooming than 
their fathers did. Only 13% say they spend less. 
</P>
<P>
Most men cite wives and girlfriends as the major influence on their grooming 
habits. In a focus-group study conducted last year by The Times, eight of the 
12 participants used the same brand-name products as the women in their lives. 
"Women grow up knowing about skin care, so I trust my wife's judgment," one man 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Women also introduce their men to cosmetic services. A Los Angeles banker says 
he watched his wife come home relaxed after her weekly facials. "So I tried it 
and got hooked. But I just don't want anyone to know." Beverly Hills facialist 
Nance Mitchell, who specializes in men's skin care, says men now come in for 
multiple services such as a facial, lash tint, back and shoulder waxing, 
manicure and pedicure -- all in one visit. But privacy is essential. "They feel 
a salon is a woman's world. They don't even like to sit in the waiting room, 
just in case they are recognized," Mitchell says. 
</P>
<P>
Confidentiality is one reason that Guerlain's new Terracotta Pour Homme, a 
virtually undetectable bronzing powder, is registering 30% of its sales via the 
firm's 800 number, says Lois Mander, a spokesperson for the French firm. "It 
allows men to be discreet about their purchases," she notes. 
</P>
<P>
But most men still aren't ready to use makeup-type products. Rather, they 
consider shaving cream, after-shave lotion and, perhaps, a fragrance to be the 
basics. But regimens are expanding. In addition to moisturizers, men are using 
special soaps and facial scrubs formulated to cleanse their skin, which is 
typically thicker and has larger pores than women's. 
</P>
<P>
Many new preparations have specific purposes, such as Clinique's Post-Shave 
Healer for razor burn or Lancome's Anti-Ageing Eye Balm, said to smooth 
crow's-feet. Other products have multiple purposes. Pour Monsieur Protection 
Concentree from Chanel and Tuscany Gel After Shaveby Aramis have moisturizing 
properties as well as scent and the cooling tingle of traditional after-shave 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Franzoi predicts that men's increasing concern with personal appearance will 
continue into the '90s. "Men now realize they can take control over their 
appearance. They never felt that they had that option before." 
</P>
</TEXT>
<GRAPHIC>
<P>
Photo, COLOR, In June, 98% of men's fragrance and grooming items are bought by 
women for Father's Day gifts, says Marv Adelman, an Aramis vice president. "The 
rest of the year, women still account for at least 50% of sales." Neal Brown

EXTERIORS: A MODERN ADOBE; 
</P>
<P>
A PURE, SIMPLE APPROACH WEDS PUEBLO STYLE TO L.A.'S MODERNIST MOVEMENT 
</P>

<BYLINE>

THE DELICATELY CRAFTED, modestly styled house that architect Lorcan O'Herlihy 
recently designed in Malibu for his parents, actor Dan O'Herlihy and his wife 
Elsie, is on a slight plateau above Trancas Canyon. The 3,200-square-foot house 
-- with its low profile; simple lines; small, sunken windows; thick, adobe-like 
walls, and roof hidden behind parapets -- is an engaging blend of traditional 
pueblo and expressive modernist design principles. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't think any design should, or could, compete with the site and the 
views, so I kept everything simple, almost minimalist," says the architect, 
who, after graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, served as an apprentice to 
such design luminaries as Kevin Roche and I. M. Pei, working with the latter on 
his famed addition to the Louvre in Paris. O'Herlihy recently opened an office 
in Venice in partnership with Richard Warner. 
</P>
<P>
The low profile of the Malibu house is accented by the minimalist proportions 
of the 13-inch-thick, stucco-clad walls; the simple detailing of the square, 
wood-framed windows, and the spacing of the square, exterior lighting fixtures. 
Helping also to set the pueblo/modernist tone is the entry from the parking 
area. It leads past a similarly styled garage on an axis along a gently rising 
Saltillo tile walkway beneath a plain wooden pergola. On it, a bougainvillea 
arbor grows. 
</P>
<P>
An oversize wooden door opens onto a warm, welcoming interior. Mexican tile 
accents the outer walk and continues into the house. You enter to a generously 
proportioned, 35x24-foot living room with a dramatic, 13-foot-high beamed 
ceiling. One wall is dominated by a large, graceful fireplace and another by a 
10-foot-square window that frames a stunning view of the ocean and sky. 
</P>
<P>
"With such a view, the house becomes a sort of backdrop," says the senior 
O'Herlihy, most recently seen in John Huston's "The Dead" and whose long, 
distinguished career includes an Academy Award nomination. "That is the way it 
should be." 
</P>
</TEXT>
<GRAPHIC>
<P>
Photo, COLOR, Architect O'Herlihy describes his design as a balance between 
pueblo and the aesthetics of early moderns such as Irving Gill and R. M. 
Shindler, whose work defined L.A. style in the '20s. A pergola accents the 
simple lines of the house and garage. Paul Waschal

GARDENS: PERFECTLY CONTAINED; 
</P>
<P>
AN EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT PLANT SALE SPAWNS SOME INVENTIVE POTTED PLANTS 
</P>

IT'S AN INTRIGUING IDEA for an annual fund-raiser: The 25 members of the 
Diggers Garden Club in Pasadena each put together "10 perfect pots." The 12 
best are selected by a jury and auctioned off, and the rest are sold at a 
by-invitation-only sale for members and friends. But what is more intriguing 
about this exclusive event is that it generates more than merely money; the 
participants come up with a bounty of ideas for growing unusual plants in 
inventive containers. 
</P>
<P>
At the most recent sale in March, one pot held a "Pick Your Own Salad Bar," 
according to its label. The exotic leafy greens included red oak leaf lettuce, 
radicchio, Lolla Rossa (an Italian loose-leaf lettuce) and Tango (a 
bronze-leafed Batavian, or crisp-head, lettuce). In a low wide bowl grew a new 
lavender phlox named 'Mrs. Crockett' (which blooms for months). In another grew 
kangaroo paw. Some pots hold small topiaries, such as creeping thyme growing in 
a lollipop shape. Miniature climbing roses were trained up tiny arbors. 
</P>
<P>
Baskets are favorite containers. Most are lined with green moss or plastic and 
then filled with soil. One member stacked up graduated sizes of terra-cotta 
saucers and then planted succulents on each concentric ledge. Another, on a 
trip overseas, shipped back several of the heavy stone troughs considered the 
classiest of containers in England and then planted one of them with rare 
rock-garden plants purchased in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The money raised by the Diggers Garden Club goes to the public gardens (such as 
the Old Mill garden in San Marino) that the organization helps plant and 
maintain.

Regarding "The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate," by Stephen Farber (April 30): As

SAFE AND SOUND NO MORE

<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for "Safe and Sound No More," by John Doyle (April 23). I am a mother 
of a 2-year-old. My house is baby-proofed, my 6-foot wrought-iron fence around 
my pool is locked, and I never let my child out of my sight in public places. 
These are things I was told to look for to keep my child from harm. Now I know 
from Doyle's very painful article to look for more than the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
I'm very sorry this happened to his children -- but I am so thankful he shared 
this story that other children may be spared.

It is difficult to describe the intense emotions I felt when I read John 
Doyle's "Safe and Sound No More." It was the first time that someone has dared 
to adequately describe the same painful feelings and emotions that I have 
experienced. Doyle's story is so similar to mine that I could have written it. 
I applaud his courage for sharing this important topic.

Think again about the "Pirates of the Caribbean" at Disneyland, which the 
Summer Splash section of May 28 described as a "perfect fantasy-kingdom." Are 
there many women, husbands and fathers whose fantasies include the slave/bride 
auctions depicted in this "champion of Disneyland attractions" -- auctions that 
resulted in rapes?

The reviewer's mention of a ride with scenes inspired by the film "Song of the

Mark Karen to be commended for his May 28 letter imploring moviegoers to assert

himself didn't follow his own advice when he went to see "Field of Dreamsa." 
Why did he sit through the entire movie without rushing to the manager to make 
a complaint?

EVERYONE'S PROBLEMS

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Berleter Hall's replay to a Jules Feiffer cartoon (May 28): Hall 
makes several outrageous accusations, including one that all of the social ills 
in the black community portrayed in Feiffer's cartoon are created by the white 
community. She bases this assertion on the idea that "only white Americans at 
the top have the power and money to bring cocaine into this country." 
</P>
<P>
Most experts place ownership of the cocaine distribution network squarely on 
the shoulders of the Colombian cartels. Does this mean that Colombians seek the 
genocide of black Americans? 
</P>
<P>
Her second point concerned teen-age pregnancy and she accurately pointed out 
that white girls have more pregnancies than other races. But she ignores the 
fact that a disproportionate percentage of black teen-agers show up in the 
overall pregnancy rate. 
</P>
<P>
Her final point concerning crimes of young white males was ambiguous at best. 
Her challenge to the media to report more crimes committed by white people was 
punctuated with the question, "Ever heard of Satanism? Manson? Hangings?" Of 
course we have, Ms. Hall. Because the "white" media told us. 
</P>
<P>
When are people like Hall going to stop tilting with the white windmills and 
start dealing with the problems? Instead of looking for the white monsters, 
blacks should be looking for white partners in solving problems that face all 
of society. Instead of searching for racist cliches, we should be searching for 
solutions. When Ms. Hall and those who think like she does realize this, we 
might effect change. Otherwise, we'll have to reprint Feiffer's cartoon year 
after year.

A SMORGASBORD OF 'PHANTOM' LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I usually agree with Martin Bernheimer -- or as much as anyone can with any 
critic who offers his opinion in "I have spoken" terms -- but not in his 
denigration of Andrew Lloyd Webber's work ("A Smorgasbord of Mush," June 4). 
</P>
<P>
It seems to be chic to extol Stephen Sondheim (yet if asked what he wrote, all 
anyone can mention is "Send In the Clowns") to the belittlement of Lloyd 
Webber, whose entire score of "Evita" is brilliant, whose song from "Cats," 
"Memory," must be one of the most beautiful ever written. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Webber is the great composer of popular music. I too have spoken.

Sullivan admirably did not flinch in pointing out that even an awesome 
production budget, spectacular staging and a powerhouse director can't save a 
musical with an iffy, often shallow score. This problem seems to occur again 
and again in the work of Lloyd Webber, successful though he is.

If Sullivan is going to dislike a work so intensely, he might devote more 
effort to justifying his very personal feelings in a more mature, sophisticated 
manner, rather than taking cheap shots and using silly, sophomoric 
alliterations. If there is bad theater, we'd like to hear about it, but The 
Times is no place for a bad writer.

Those who have dashed out of the Ahmanson to praise "Phantom" will no doubt be 
searching Bernheimer out with the intent of bodily injury. He has exposed their 
lack of taste and ignorance of musicals. 
</P>
<P>
While I've only heard bits and pieces, seen odds and ends of the actual 
production, selected excerpts for promotion and general advertising, that's all 
that is needed to know that Lloyd Webber's latest offering shows little if any 
talent or effort on his part. 
</P>
<P>
Bernheimer is to be commended for having the courage to say that this musical 
has phantom music and phantom lyrics, haunted not by a Phantom of the Opera but 
rather a phantom of mediocrity.

WALL STREET/JOHN CRUDELE: INVESTMENT EXPERTS DON'T ALWAYS TAKE OWN ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Crudele, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Miller, chief investment officer of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette 
Securities Corp., recently asked 21 money managers who were assembled in Pebble 
Beach, Calif., about the strategy they are using to invest their own money. 
</P>
<P>
Of the group, nine (or about 40%) said their personal strategy was more 
defensive than that of their clients, seven said theirs was about the same and 
five said they were more aggressive than their clients. 
</P>
<P>
Like it or not, investment advisers don't always practice what they preach -- 
sometimes they tell clients one thing and do something quite different with 
their own money. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, an informal survey that I conducted right before the October, 1987, 
crash showed that a number of folks who work closely with the stock market were 
pulling their own money out of the market even while most Wall Street firms 
were publicly professing unguarded optimism about the future of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Miller says he had a similar finding when he conducted a survey in 1987, just 
months before the crash. He said 60% of the investment advisers at that time 
said they were investing more conservatively than were their clients. They, of 
course, were the smart ones. 
</P>
<P>
With the stock market now blithely moving to post-crash highs, I decided once 
again to ask the folks on Wall Street the big question: What are you doing with 
your own money? 
</P>
<P>
What I found out was that these Wall Street pros -- like most other investors 
-- still remember the sting of 1987, and they've remained cautious about 
putting too much money into stocks. That, of course, also means that they've 
missed out of the big stock market windfall of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what some had to say: 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who is 60, says he's being fairly conservative because of his age. He 
has only about 25% of his investable money in the stock market. The rest is 
divided into a mix of cash, cash equivalents and bonds, the percentages of 
which Miller didn't want to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
Although Miller says he had predicted that the Dow Jones industrial average 
would go to 2,500 this year, he didn't feel that the reward was great enough to 
offset the risk of having too much money invested in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Also, since Miller makes his living off the stock market, he didn't want his 
paycheck and his investments riding on the same bet. "I didn't see (the market) 
as having enormous potential," Miller says, who adds that he will stick with 
his current portfolio mix unless his concerns about inflation grow. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley Eppel, a managing director at DLJ, also has been cautious this year. 
"The only one who's making money," says Eppel, "is my wife, because she never 
sells anything." 
</P>
<P>
Eppel says his own investable money has been mostly in Treasury bills, which 
have been yielding around 9%. "I'm perfectly happy with 9%," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Like other victims of the crash, Eppel learned a lesson that actually hurt his 
portfolio's performance during the past six months. "They," he says, obviously 
referring to some mythical bad guys who steal wealth, "are not going to get a 
nickel back. Not after October." 
</P>
<P>
That William King, a trader with Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc. in Chicago, 
doesn't like the stock market right now is obvious. He has 80% of his money in 
cash, and 20% in inflation-resistant gold stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"People are too bullish," says King. "So you are going to have limited upside." 
With so many money managers being won over to an optimistic view of the market 
in recent weeks, King fears that the bulk of the money that could go into the 
market and push stock prices higher is already in the market. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Conlon, executive vice president and director of the equities division at 
Nikko Securities, says that "like a lot of other people, I've been bullish 
(about the stock market) but haven't pulled the trigger." 
</P>
<P>
He has about 30% of his investment money in bonds, an equal amount in stocks 
and the rest in cash. "My inclination is getting stronger and stronger to pull 
the trigger and buy some stock," says Conlon. "I'm concerned that I might miss 
the boat." 
</P>
<P>
Conlon says he particularly likes stocks with takeover potential, such as 
Hilton Hotels and NWA Corp.; bank stocks like BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp, 
and beat-up technology issues like IBM and Digital Equipment. When Conlon does 
pull that trigger, the 40% of his money in cash will end up in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Suresh Bhirud, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., turned 
cautious on the stock market about five months -- and a couple of hundred Dow 
points -- ago. About 20% of Bhirud's money is in cash, about 30% in 
fixed-income investments and 50% in equities. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe sentiment in both stocks and bonds is bullish. That means this is 
not the time I would get very aggressive," Bhirud says. As for bonds, Bhirud 
thinks there is still plenty of time to get into bonds with long maturities 
before interest rates fall much more. 
</P>
<P>
But if the economy does show signs of slowing, Bhirud says, he will increase 
the maturities on his fixed-income investments to lock in higher interest rates 
before they are no longer available. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is cautious about the financial markets. L. Crandall Hays, 
director of investment strategy at Milwaukee's Robert W. Baird &amp; Co., says 
he's 85% to 90% invested in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
But Hays also is starting to have doubts. Last month, he pulled back from a 
100% invested position and, he says, might take more and more of his money out 
of the market. "As (the market) goes higher, I'd pull back. If it hits 2,700, 
then I think it would be prudent to cut back some more." 
</P>
<P>
Is it time to start investing again in newspaper companies? 
</P>
<P>
Drew Marcus, who follows the industry for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., thinks 
that advertising that newspapers get from retailers is improving at a 
better-than-expected pace since early this year, and he's cautiously advised 
clients that it is time to start buying the best -- and only the best -- 
newspaper stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"Retail advertising is going to stabilize at a higher-than-expected level," 
says Marcus, whose buy recommendations on Gannett Co. and the Washington Post 
helped those stocks during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Retail advertising was up 3.8% in the first quarter, according to Marcus, which 
was the best gain in a year. He expects that this crucial advertising segment 
will improve by 4% this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still not back to the heyday," says Marcus. "But it's still a hell of a 
lot better than we saw in the third and fourth quarter of last year." He thinks 
that both Gannett and the Washington Post -- because of cost-cutting measures 
-- will have good earnings growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, believe that newspaper stocks are risky, especially while 
there is still concern about a possible recession in the U.S. economy. And, 
they say, the small pickup in retail advertising that Marcus is seeing will not 
be enough to turn around the industry's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking for a pickup in retail advertising," says John Morton of 
John Morton &amp; Co., a Washington-based research firm that deals exclusively 
with media stocks. He says advertising revenue in general will grow 5% to 5.5% 
for newspapers this year -- barely keeping up with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Mr. Icahn, 
</P>
<P>
It sure must feel good to pocket that $2 billion-plus you got from selling all 
those Texaco shares. But I can understand what a burden it must also be trying 
to invest so large an amount. You can't really buy T-bills -- it would be bad 
for your image as an in-the-know type of guy. And money market funds just 
wouldn't get you a return that you'd be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
So here's some advice from your friends on Wall Street. I asked a number of 
people what they would do with the money, if they were you. Here are their 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
* "I would wait, sit back and let the market try to guess what I'm going to do. 
He's waited so long, why not wait another month or so. But it would depend on 
whether or not there was a compelling reason to do something quickly, i.e., to 
act as a spoiler in another merger. Then you might have to move faster." -- a 
Wall Street speculator. 
</P>
<P>
* "Icahn wants to be a noted industrialist, so he might take the $2 billion and 
buy airplanes. On the other hand, he's a trader at heart, so he may find it 
irresistible to go after USX Corp. My knee-jerk reaction would be to retire and 
stay on the Riviera, but I think I'd keep doing what I'm doing." -- a 
well-known investment banker who didn't want to be well known on this 
particular question. 
</P>
<P>
* "I'd probably buy a company. There are lots of stocks that haven't moved at 
all in the last year, all through the basic-industry sector. These include 
aluminum, paper, chemicals -- not every one, but most of them. That's what I 
would do with it." -- Michael Sherman, chairman of the investment policy 
committee at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
* "I would put it to work, but exactly where I'd go is difficult to say. You 
have so much money and you want to take something big to make effective use of 
that much money. With the change of the guard at USX, there is a vulnerability. 
Anapte knows it. It's a reasonable place to go." -- Monte Gordon, research 
director of Dreyfus Corp. 
</P>
<P>
* "He's a believer in the energy field, because of his positions in USX and 
Williams Cos. To think he might look back toward the energy field is an odds-on 
bet. If I had a $650-million profit, I would definitely look for another 
acquisition. I still think there are undervalued assets out there." -- Liam 
Dalton, chief executive of Capital Hill Group, a money management firm for 
wealthy people. 
</P>
<P>
* "I'd quit my job and take off for Europe." -- a stock trader who also would 
partake of other pastimes that are unprintable. 
</P>
<P>
As for me, here's what I would do if I were Carl Icahn. First, I'd wait awhile 
to let the situation cool off. In a couple of months I'd start dropping hints 
that I have some suggestions for running USX Corp. Icahn, after all, does own 
29.3 million USX shares, or around 11% of the outstanding stock, on which he 
already has a $410-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
If that ploy isn't sufficiently effective in getting USX's management to do 
anything I wanted, I'd start leaking to the press that I was preparing an offer 
for the Pittsburgh-based steel and energy company. I'd even start talking 
informally to investment bankers about raising money. That always gets people's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
USX's stock closed Friday at $38 a share, so I'd hint that my bid would be in 
the high $40s. Then I'd make sure that the press found out that I was huddling 
with bankers. 
</P>
<P>
By this point, USX should be very accommodating. Icahn has said he wants the 
company to split itself into two -- one part consisting of the steel business 
and the other the energy operations. Perhaps he'll start clamoring for a 
special dividend, or an increased regular dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn would have to be prepared to buy the rest of USX if push came to shove. 
But it probably won't ever go this far, as Icahn discovered when he pulled this 
same ruse while going after Texaco last year. Soon USX's stock will be up in 
price, and Icahn eventually will be able to sell his stock holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Then everyone can start wondering which company is Icahn's real target. Is it 
Union Carbide, in which Icahn is believed to own 3.5% of the company's stock; 
Williams Cos., in which Icahn owns less than 5%, or some other unlucky company 
nobody's thought of yet? I'll save that speculation for another column.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS /GEORGE L. PERRY: A MESSAGE FOR S&amp;L LOBBY, 
CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George L. Perry, GEORGE L. PERRY is a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution research organization in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As you may have noticed from the business pages, savings and loan institutions 
-- thrifts, for short -- have been going bankrupt at an alarming rate during 
the past few years. Because the deposits at these institutions are insured 
against loss by a federal government agency, the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp., depositors' money is not at risk. 
</P>
<P>
But the record number of bankruptcies long ago exhausted the FSLIC's reserves, 
so the government must provide funds to make good on the deposit insurance. 
Doing so is the first objective of legislation before Congress, and it is 
generally agreed that, if the problem does not worsen, it will cost $100 
billion to $150 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The second objective of the legislation is to change the rules governing 
thrifts to avoid repeating the present crisis in the future or having the 
present crisis spread much further and cost much more than is now projected. 
</P>
<P>
One might have thought that, in a demonstrable crisis that already is costing 
taxpayers megabucks, business in Washington as usual might be suspended. Yet 
the lobby for the thrift industry continues on its narrowly self-serving way, 
and many in Congress, despite all that has happened, seem unwilling to resist 
that pressure. Unless it changes direction soon, Congress will have weakened 
the legislation originally offered by the Administration and so will have 
increased the likelihood of a renewed thrift crisis in the future and increased 
the cost that taxpayers will eventually bear. 
</P>
<P>
Mutual Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Pasadena recently reacted to all this in a 
refreshing way. The institution, controlled by the fabled investor Warren E. 
Buffett and chaired by Charles T. Munger, resigned in disgust from the U.S. 
League of Savings Institutions, the industry's main lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
In pulling out of the league, Munger offered a remarkably salty assessment of 
its actions to date. "The league responds to the savings and loan mess as Exxon 
would have responded to the oil spill from the Valdez if it had insisted 
thereafter on liberal use of whiskey by tanker captains," he said. For good 
measure, he added, "It is not unfair to liken the situation now facing Congress 
to cancer and to liken the league to a significant carcinogenic agent." 
</P>
<P>
We can applaud Buffet and Munger for calling attention to the harm being done 
by the S&amp;L lobby. But they should have directed some of their attention to 
Congress itself, whose members should understand the problem and the harm they 
can do. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the problems of the thrift industry and the risk of huge additional 
costs to taxpayers from future insolvencies is the perverse incentive structure 
that exists for insured depository institutions. Because deposits are insured, 
depositors have little concern for how safely management invests their money. 
Depositors mainly go where they get the highest interest rate. A thrift can 
take exceptional risks, and its depositors are unlikely to know -- let alone 
care. If the big risk succeeds, the thrift makes a lot of money. If it fails, 
the depositors are insured. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are still losses to the owners if the thrift fails. But the 
amount of owners' capital at risk is very small relative to the total of 
deposits and investments, so any major gains accrue to the owners, while any 
major losses are borne mainly by the insurance system. This asymmetry between 
possible gain and loss can and has been used to advantage by unscrupulous 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
But even honorably run institutions can be driven to take excessive risk if 
doing so offers a chance to save the institution from insolvency. If an 
institution initially gets into trouble because economic conditions turn some 
of its loans and investments sour, losses can erode its capital to the point at 
which it amounts to, say, less than 1% of its assets. The owners have little or 
nothing left to lose. Yet taking risks with the assets offers the chance for 
profits that could rescue the institution from insolvency. In effect, the owner 
is invited to gamble -- with a chance of winning big and with the insurance 
fund's money available to cover losses. 
</P>
<P>
It is evident that the insurance system needs some greater discipline to 
neutralize the incentives for excessive risk taking that otherwise exist. One 
kind of proposal would tighten restrictions on what investments an institution 
is allowed to make. The usual proposal would restrict thrifts more closely to 
mortgage lending, which historically was their main activity. However, the net 
effect of such restrictions is uncertain because a more diversified portfolio 
should reduce the risk associated with economic fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves stiffer capital requirements, which would put more of the owners' 
money at risk, as the main discipline that is available and that is widely 
agreed to be necessary. The Administration had proposed gradually bringing the 
capital requirements of thrifts up to the 6% capital requirement of banks. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful thrift lobby has been pressuring Congress not only to settle for a 
capital requirement only half that large but to allow "good will" -- the value 
of a company in excess of its tangible assets -- to count as capital for 
purposes of meeting the requirement. The Congress might remember that 
taxpayers, who will have to pick up the tab for thrift failures, cannot meet 
their tax obligations with "good will."

BEHIND RJR'S SMOKE SCREEN OF DENIAL IS THE TRUTH: COMPANY PITCHES CIGARETTES TO 
TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the May 2 marketing column ("Cigarette Ads: A Matter of Conscience"), David 
Fishel, a vice president at RJR Nabisco, is quoted as saying, "The simple fact 
is, we don't target our advertising appeal to young people." 
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, the company recently scheduled a rock concert featuring a local teen 
idol and tickets were not for sale at any price. Instead, the admission fee was 
five empty packs of Winston cigarettes! 
</P>
<P>
A sizable portion of the $2.4 billion the tobacco companies spend every year on 
advertising and promotion goes for ads in magazines with lots of teen-age 
readers, such as Glamour, Sports Illustrated and TV Guide. Tobacco companies 
spend over $1 billion a year on sporting events popular with adolescents, such 
as the Virginia Slims tennis tournaments, Newport ski races, Marlboro boat 
races and Winston Cup car races. 
</P>
<P>
There also are items for the kids such as Marlboro candy cigarettes, Big League 
Chew bubble gum sold in pouches resembling those for chewing tobacco and Chaw 
powdered bubble gum sold in tins identical to those that contain snuff. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, Mr. Fishel, don't hand us such whoppers!

RUSSIA: EMBOLDENED EXPRESSION

By Craig S. Barnes, Craig S. Barnes, a vice president of the Beyond War 
Foundation, is project director of From Human Rights to Human Dignity, a joint 
undertaking of Beyond War with the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet 
Human Rights Commission.

PALO ALTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Americans in Moscow the unmarked office of Anatoli Belyayev is an important 
stop, up a flight of dark stairs, down a quiet corridor. Americans go there 
because Belyayev is part of the revolutionary changes in the Soviet Union. In 
April he came to California and, while he was in Palo Alto, Moscow 
conservatives tried to close him down. 
</P>
<P>
Belyayev is a round, gruff, crusty editor in chief. If you are bright he likes 
you; if you are not, he folds his arms across his big stomach and says, "I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Belyayev's monthly journal, Twentieth Century and Peace, was once known as a 
propaganda rag, an arm of the Peace Committee that had blasted the United 
States for 40 years. But Belyayev has been changing all that, collecting a 
group of brilliant writers on the cutting edge of the democratic movement: Len 
Karpinsky has been more insightful about the failures of socialism than many 
Western observers. Yuri F. Karyakin has been insistent on the need for a global 
vision not dependent on weapons. Alex Adamovich has been hammering on 
Chernobyl, Stalin, conscription and war. 
</P>
<P>
Circulation has climbed, last year jumping from a modest 50,000 to 120,000. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, Belyayev printed Alexander Solzhenitsyn's "Live Not by Lies," 
the first Solzhenitsyn published legally in the Soviet Union since the early 
'70s. Although legal, it upset the Peace Committee. In February the committee's 
leadership told the editor to start submitting material for advance approval. 
</P>
<P>
Belyayev, a stubborn man, said, "We don't know any military secrets," assuming 
that as the only legal basis for censorship. There the matter rested until 
April, when he came to the United States for a meeting on human rights 
sponsored by the Beyond War Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
While he was gone, the Peace Committee chose to suppress the May issue of 
Twentieth Century and Peace. It was the sort of rejection calculated to send a 
message: too far out; other publications beware. 
</P>
<P>
Belyayev was in our house on Sunday when he heard the news. He immediately 
called Moscow. When he got off the phone he said, "I will not panic. They do 
not know that I know. And they do not know that I am making calls. I can do 
this as well from here as from Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
Then followed days of phone calls. After each one, Belyayev sat down, drank tea 
and told a little more of the 1989 March-April political turmoil in Moscow. His 
story illuminates a patchwork of events, events so significant that another 
visitor, who helped engineer the March election victories in Leningrad, said: 
"If you haven't been to the Soviet Union since the elections, you have never 
been here. Everything has changed." 
</P>
<P>
In the March 25 balloting for the Congress of Deputies, the Communist Party was 
humiliated. The party label itself was sufficient to sink a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Those defeats sent a wave of apprehension all the way up to the Central 
Committee, atop the power structure. Rapid responses followed, some bloody, 
some threatening: 
</P>
<P>
April 8. The conservatives make a dramatic move. A decree issued by the 
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet calls for imprisonment of up to 10 years for 
public advocacy of change "by methods contrary to the U.S.S.R. constitution." 
There is also a provision of three years' imprisonment for public insult or 
defaming "of the Soviet state or government institutions and their officials." 
</P>
<P>
"Public insult" is hard to define. Since no one knew what would be an "insult," 
prosecutors could have a field day. The new decree causes dramatic alarm among 
glasnost proponents. 
</P>
<P>
Is the "decree" law? No one knows for sure. In the hierarchical Soviet system a 
high-up source is treated as authoritative. All you have to know is how high 
up. The Supreme Soviet is very high indeed. 
</P>
<P>
April 9. Georgian nationalists demonstrating in the capital city of Tbilisi are 
precipitously attacked by soldiers wielding sharpened shovels and using gas; 20 
people, including women and children, are killed. Moscow intellectuals are 
outraged, charging that no local Tbilisi authorities could have given orders to 
kill. All fingers point to Kremlin conservatives exaggerating the dangers of 
disorder and, in the process, undermining Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika 
and glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
 April 14. The Ministry of Internal Affairs (KGB) announces that crime in the 
country has jumped by 31.2% in the first three months of 1989 and calls for 
"decisive measures to restore order." 
</P>
<P>
April 16. The same ministry announces that it has found "explosive devices" at 
two Moscow subway stations. Progressives react with disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
April 20. Conservatives push further. The Politburo announces that there will 
soon be a new law to increase media responsibility. There will also be a law on 
informal associations, to create "a flexible legal watchdog mechanism." The 
measures appear directed at two of the most important forces behind 
democratization. 
</P>
<P>
April 21. The Peace Committee informs Belyayev's Moscow deputy that the May 
issue will be suppressed. Within that issue is an important article examining 
Solidarity in Poland from the workers' point of view. The April 20 proposed law 
seems to be in immediate effect. 
</P>
<P>
The law also affects an informal group, the Moscow Tribunal, which includes 
intellectuals such as Andrei Sakharov, Adamovich and Karyakin. Together with a 
popular group called the Democratic Union, they have been planning a 
demonstration in Pushkin Square for April 22. 
</P>
<P>
April 21. Pravda denounces the Democratic Union. The stage is set. If these 
groups lose nerve the conservative tide will continue rising. Perhaps worse, if 
demonstrators go ahead and authorities overreact, there could be a repeat of 
the Georgia bloodshed in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
That night the highly prestigious Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences 
addresses a letter to the Central Committee calling for the prosecution of the 
people "who made the order from Moscow to do the military violence in Georgia." 
This is a strong, almost unheard of call for action by prestigious people 
against prestigious people. One year earlier a conservative letter in a 
newspaper had been enough to quiet the perestroika crowd for three weeks. Not 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
April 22. The Pushkin Square rally proceeds peacefully, without incident. 
</P>
<P>
April 23. Belyayev, in Palo Alto, learns of the suppression of his issue. 
Quietly he vows a countercampaign: "We will not only publish in May," he says 
with a wry smile, "we will go now for a complete reorganization of the Peace 
Committee." 
</P>
<P>
Belyayev opponents may think the editor is too far away to act. In fact, with 
the improbable help of AT&amp;T, the editor conducts his campaign from 
California. Three members of his editorial board are newly elected to the 
Congress of Deputies: Yuri S. Afanasiev, Adamovich and Karyakin. Belyayev 
rallies them and their new-found influence: They agree on a protest to the 
Central Committee where the real conservative power resides. 
</P>
<P>
April 24. Belyayev continues calling. Unbeknown to him, but perhaps partly 
because of his efforts, Gorbachev is about to act against the same target. 
</P>
<P>
April 25. Gorbachev engineers a breathtaking sweep, ousting 110 members of the 
old-guard members from the Central Committee. The "dead souls," as progressives 
call them, are suddenly gone. Belyayev leans back on a couch in a Palo Alto 
living room: "We can have tea, now. All bad news is smashed by the results of 
this meeting." 
</P>
<P>
April 26. Belyayev calls to learn that his magazine has been allowed to go to 
press "with only minor changes." Belyayev takes a day off, visits a San Jose 
flea market to buy toys for his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
So the second Soviet revolution lurches forward. One observer suggested that 
"the conservatives lost as soon as the telephone was invented." 
</P>
<P>
But nothing is that easy. "In a state without property," observes Fyodor 
Burlatsky, chairman of the Soviet Human Rights Commission, "the bureaucracy are 
the nobility. They have the power." Giving up that power requires a struggle, 
one permission or regulation at a time. The success of glasnost may depend upon 
the people's patience. If the people lose patience, there could be a repeat of 
the Chinese experience. But if they persist -- as they have so far -- the quiet 
revolution may continue.

JAPAN: TAINTED SUCCESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sosuke Uno is Japan's new prime minister -- accomplished at kendo, deft with an 
artist's brush and a rather better piano player than Harry S. Truman. He spent 
two years in a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp and wrote a book about it that 
eventually became a movie. 
</P>
<P>
The rigors of that experience qualify him as a survivor. He will need to be. No 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) prime minister in recent memory has taken office 
in less auspicious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
His chances of succeeding, after predecessor Noboru Takeshita was politically 
bruised and then mortally wounded by fallout from Japan's Recruit scandal, do 
not look good. 
</P>
<P>
Uno takes over a divided party, its divisions worsened by his own candidacy. 
Like Italy's Christian Democrats, the LDP is organized around factions and 
their baronial leaders. Uno's unhappy situation is to be a member of the one 
party group -- the old Yasuhiro Nakasone faction -- now most in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone is an elusive fish who has eluded the grasp of the powerful Tokyo 
public prosecutor's office, which has been responsible for investigating the 
scandal. But no one doubts his deep involvement in the Recruit affair. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his perceived focal role in Japan's worst postwar political scandal, 
Nakasone has had to resign from his own faction and renounce membership in the 
ruling party itself. How then has his faction given Japan its new prime 
minister even while losing its leader and its name? 
</P>
<P>
The ostensible reason was this summer's economic summit in Paris. As the only 
Asian nation in attendance, the Japanese have always felt required to put their 
best feet forward at such international sessions, to which they attach 
inordinate importance. 
</P>
<P>
With Takeshita wounded beyond repair, LDP leaders had a problem: Almost every 
senior politician with international experience was linked to the scandal. Uno 
was "clean" and had been Takeshita's foreign minister for 18 months. So he was 
called to assume the leadership of his limping party. 
</P>
<P>
When the composition of Uno's Cabinet is examined, any "international" argument 
looks rather thin. Uno's successor as foreign minister, for example, has little 
experience in the field; other Cabinet choices reflect less high-minded 
international concern than a domestic determination to keep the money-driven 
factions happy. 
</P>
<P>
Further, being a member of the suspect Nakasone faction, Uno was hardly 
anyone's first choice for premier. The man almost everybody would have 
preferred was the remarkable Masayoshi Ito, a veteran politician first regarded 
as a distinctly "dark horse" (the phrase is used in Japanese, another borrowing 
from English). 
</P>
<P>
Yet When Ito was offered the job of party president (and, therefore, the post 
of prime minister), he shocked the party by saying "no," not once but twice. 
The more he resisted, the more his stock climbed with the citizenry. In the 
process, Ito became the Recruit Scandal's only hero. 
</P>
<P>
To everyone's surprise, Ito had stuck to his principles. He demanded major 
reforms, including abolition of the factions, as the price for taking over in 
an hour of crisis. But the party barons would not buy the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Though down in the polls, LDP leaders are simply unwilling to give up the 
perquisites and privileges that make it worthwhile to become a Japanese 
politician in the first place. Their attitude is not quite the Renaissance 
attitude -- "now that we have the papacy, let us enjoy it" -- but it's close. 
</P>
<P>
So the messy job that the principled would not have, and that the grasping 
could not be allowed to accept, now belongs to Uno, who knows one more reason 
why Ito declined: On July 23, Japan goes to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
The voting will be for the House of Councilors, Japan's upper chamber. Its 
powers, like Britain's House of Lords, are essentially confined to delaying 
legislation. The LDP holds 73 of the 126 seats being contested, and is certain 
to lose its majority. 
</P>
<P>
Nasty defeat may be just what the ruling party needs to stir itself to reform, 
but cynics insist that the Japanese public will have forgotten the present fuss 
by the time they vote next month, and in any case Japan's opposition parties 
are too disorganized and divided to exploit the electoral opportunity that 
scandal has given them. 
</P>
<P>
Yet other nasty business fouls the atmosphere. Public-opinion surveys suggest 
that a new sales tax (the first for postwar Japan) has caused more anger toward 
the ruling party than the scandal. The LDP is also in trouble with its powerful 
rural constituencies over Japanese concessions to Washington concerning farm 
products. 
</P>
<P>
How may the Bush Administration proceed? Any sober assessment of U.S. ties with 
Japan should begin with the recognition that these profound links constitute 
the world's most important bilateral relationship. Despite tiffs over trade, 
the Reagan years left the relationship on solid footing. 
</P>
<P>
But the deep reserves of good will created during Ambassador Mike Mansfield's 
long tour of duty in Tokyo -- for both the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan 
administrations -- are now being drained by a Bush Administration short of 
Japanese expertise and apparently confused about where it would like to take 
the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The shared and conflicting interests at work in the decision about who would 
build how much of the FSX fighter made a tussle with the Japanese inevitable. 
Inconsistent Administration statements and attitudes toward Japan make the 
tussle worse, leaving Tokyo irritated and confused. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: As rather plodding policy-makers themselves, the Japanese were 
not at all bothered by the notion that the Administration "hit the ground 
crawling." But then, after nearly four months in office, U.S. Trade 
Representative Carla A. Hills came out of her corner wildly chastising Tokyo 
for Japanese trading postures. 
</P>
<P>
When Michael H. Armacost, the new ambassador to Tokyo, rushed to defend the 
Hills thesis, his language sounded more like a rural Missouri congressman than 
a knowing Asia hand. The Bush Administration looked distinctly amateurish, at 
least to the Japanese. Now, with Japanese politics in flux, this perceived 
amateurishness may get America into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the expectations of the U.S. Administration, there is no possibility 
of a Nakasone-style "action program" to stimulate Japanese imports 
artificially. Uno, widely regarded as a prisoner of the tainted old guard, will 
have little room to maneuver, and may not survive an LDP defeat in the July 
elections. With Japanese party politics in such a delicate phase, the U.S. 
Administration would be advised to tailor any trade offensive with exquisite 
caution. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese bureaucracy, particularly the powerful Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI), is perfectly capable of sustaining an aggressive 
dialogue on the future of what the Japanese like to call the Nichi-bei keizai 
(the U.S.-Japan economy). 
</P>
<P>
The ministry's new white paper on the economy will be issued this week and it 
should provide new evidence of structural change in the Japanese economy, from 
foreign-market to domestic-market dependence. Rumors say it also contains new, 
incisive criticism of U.S. protectionist logic -- an issue worth pursuing.

A WORLD OF SHOCK AND AFTERSHOCK; 
</P>
<P>
CHINA: BRUTAL SUPPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Edward A. Gargan, Edward A. Gargan, chief of the New York Times Bureau in 
Beijing from 1986 to 1988, is now working on a book about China. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BEIJING 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As dawn broke Sunday, a Chinese tank rolled over a luminously white statue of a 
woman, her two arms holding a symbolic flame above her head, that had stood for 
10 days in the heart of the capital. It is said on Beijing's campuses that the 
tank also crushed to death 11 students who had linked arms in a protective 
circle around the statue, a figure they called "minzhuzhishen" the goddess of 
liberty. 
</P>
<P>
It was a week of indescribable horror for the citizens of Beijing, for the 
people of China. The jubilant if weary weeks of pro-democracy protest were 
truncated by the tanks and machine guns of China's leadership which, the world 
now knows, responded to yearnings for a freer society, with mass slaughter. 
This massacre, an act instigated by the brutish primal instincts of a Communist 
leadership honed not by debate but by discipline, not by compromise but by 
diktat, not by persuasion but by force, has profoundly, and in many ways 
indelibly, changed modern China. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, volumes have been written depicting China as a nation that 
had found itself, a nation that had escaped the devastation of the Cultural 
Revolution and was emerging as a society with values and virtues approaching 
those of the West. China was becoming a stable, modern country, one that 
recognized the need to adhere to international standards of behavior 
economically, as well as the more basic humanitarian principles accepted as an 
essential component of a civilized society. 
</P>
<P>
Much was done to bolster this image by the United States. In recent years, 
visits by U.S. officials, from the President down to mayors of small cities, 
encouraged this perception of a China at ease with itself and the world. 
Foreign companies looked gleefully at this newly emergent respectability and 
fought each other to invest here. Modern hotels sprang up like stands of new 
pine. Their restaurants served Chateau Lynch-Bages and goose liver pate. The 
U.S. ambassador routinely hailed the stability and wisdom of the leadership to 
American reporters, insisting at every occasion that periodic bursts of 
repression were anomalous twitches of a maturing polity. 
</P>
<P>
At every turn, suggestions that there were fundamental contradictions between 
China's modernizing process, one that favored free markets and 
entrepreneurialism, and the rigidities of a Communist Party weaned on 
totalitarianism were contemptuously dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
China's students, in those weeks before the tanks thundered down the Avenue of 
Heavenly Peace, shared that optimism, that sense that there was no turning back 
to the black years of repression and hopelessness. China was becoming more 
open, they said repeatedly. In classrooms, students skimmed Karl Marx but they 
poured over Adam Smith, Walt Whitman and Sigmund Freud. "There is nothing we 
cannot read. There is nothing we cannot write. There is nothing we cannot say," 
a Chinese professor said some months ago. And the students were reassured by 
their leaders, doddering men who had learned their politics on the battlefield, 
that yes, China would never retreat. 
</P>
<P>
That conviction, that feeling that history's momentum would carry them forward 
to a China of genuine liberties and freedoms, guaranteed not by the promises of 
self-anointed leaders but by the institutions they created, spurred tens of 
thousands of students to demand those rights, and lured hundreds of thousands 
of Beijing citizens to follow. If, in their heart of hearts, they suspected the 
Communist Party was, in the end, immutable, they never allowed those fears to 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
But China's leaders, the senior ranks of the Communist Party could not tolerate 
demands on it, demands to loosen its grip once and for all upon the lives of 
the Chinese people. Some among the leaders -- former party Secretary Zhao 
Ziyang is the one most often cited -- seemed more sympathetic to the students, 
but the men who controlled the levers of power, the army, the police, the vast 
propaganda apparatus, refused to countenance this challenge to their authority. 
</P>
<P>
The days of marches, the hunger strikes, the encampments on Tian An Men Square 
were not, they determined, peaceful petition and protest. This was 
counterrevolution. This call for democracy and freedom was a threat to the 
survival of the Communist Party itself. And of course, these leaders were 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the tanks rumbled into Tian An Men Square, their headlights 
illuminating the frail line of unarmed students who stood determined and 
frightened before them, there were flickering signs that some in the army, some 
in the party, would never stomach the slaughter of civilians. But these voices 
of moderation were stifled by the rattle of assault rifles, the clatter of 
cartloads of bodies frantically being pushed to overburdened hospitals, the 
determination that military dictatorship was preferable to reasoned discourse. 
</P>
<P>
In the days that followed the carnage, underground student presses continued to 
churn out broadsheets describing the army's massacre and urging the people of 
Beijing, as one put it, "never to forget this blackest day in China's history." 
</P>
<P>
But the army had retaken the city, its buildings and squares, its avenues and 
marketplaces. Every night, the crack of automatic weapons fire echoed through 
deserted streets as army patrols imposed the new reign of terror. In the 
neighborhoods of Beijing, residents would point to ugly dark stains on 
sidewalks. "An old man was killed here," a fearful neighborhood resident would 
say, "shot in the head." 
</P>
<P>
And now, within the last few days, the army and armed police have turned their 
attention in earnest to the instigators of this "counterrevolution" -- the men 
and women of China's universities and scholarly institutions, the people who 
had fashioned China's intellectual resurgence, its resurrection from the 
systematic tyranny over the mind that endured until a mere decade ago. Columns 
of troops swept into the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the home for some 
of the country's most progressive thinkers -- men such as Yan Jiaqi, Su Shaozhi 
and Liu Zaifu -- and began a systematic search for "evidence" of 
counterrevolutionary activities. The military occupation of the city's 
universities, now nearly drained of terrorized students, is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
There is little question what China will look like in the coming months and 
years. Ideas will be displaced by empty slogans, discussion by silence, hope by 
fear, humanity by violence. Many, many people will be arrested. Public trials 
will be held and executions will be touted as "victories" in the struggle 
against counter- revolution. The best of China's minds will be shackled by a 
repression this country once experienced during the Cultural Revolution, but 
the world ignored. 
</P>
<P>
This time, graphically, the world has seen what China's leaders really are and, 
for China, the world will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
But the men at the apex of the Communist Party and the army simply do not care 
what the world sees. That China's economic growth, tied increasingly to 
international trade and investment, will be set back a decade or more is 
irrelevant to leaders whose sole concern is the preservation of armed power. 
That China will no longer sit at the world table as a respected member of the 
international community matters not one wit to men for whom the grinding 
poverty of authoritarianism is preferable to an affluence of pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
What Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun and Li Peng have won, though, is a victory of 
generals, a victory of occupied territory, of secured street corners and 
recaptured monuments. What they have not won, what they cannot win, what they 
have lost forever, are the hearts and minds of the Chinese people. Two enormous 
banners on the gate posts that flank the entrance to Beijing University put it 
succinctly: "It is not that the people have no government, it is that the 
government has no people." 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers armed with assault rifles that march through that gate will never 
see that banner -- the advance wave of party zealots have had it effaced. But 
its message will linger for years. Indeed, in the darkest days of repression 
yet to come, there will remain vivid memories of the murderous rampage let 
loose by China's leaders, and more, the memory that there were better days 
before and there may be some still ahead. 
</P>
<P>
A university student riding his bicycle through the war-torn streets of Beijing 
pedaled quietly for a while before speaking. But when he spoke, his words, 
colored by the tragedy of the week, told of a deeply rooted certainty that the 
Chinese people would overcome even this calamity. "There must be blood to have 
democracy," he said. "In Chinese history, there has always been blood."

IRAN: FUNERAL DEPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mansour Farhang, Mansour Farhang, professor of politics at Bennington 
College, is co-author, with William A. Dorman, of The U.S. Press and Iran: 
Foreign Policy and the Journalism of Deference (University of California 
Press).

<TEXT>
<P>
The dirge playing on Tehran radio is not merely a funeral hymn for the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini but also the opening theme for a new period in the 
Iranian revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's unconditional rule was simultaneously a blessing and curse for Iran 
-- blessing because it preserved functional unity among rival factions and 
curse because absence of a dominant voice caused policy paralysis. Now that 
Khomeini is gone, it is not clear if the regime can prevent violent internal 
purges. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that continuation of current uncertainty about foreign policy 
and domestic economy can threaten the survival of the regime. The new 
leadership simply cannot afford to ignore the widespread frustrations and 
deprivations that have resulted from a decade of economic decline, war, massive 
unemployment, high inflation and rapid population growth. 
</P>
<P>
While the theocratic power structure is likely to remain in place, at least in 
the short run, the new leadership to emerge from an inevitable power struggle 
is bound to give government more coherent direction. The quick selection of 
President Ali Khamenei by the Assembly of Experts as the interim supreme 
religious guide demonstrates that there is a mechanism in place to name, in due 
time, a permanent successor or successors to Khomeini. But as the players in 
this high-stakes power game are aware, the task of succeeding "the viceroy of 
God on Earth" is more than a formal or procedural matter. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment it seems all but certain that Hashemi Rafsanjani, Speaker of 
Parliament, will be named president on Aug. 18. It remains to be seen whether 
at that time the Assembly of Experts will also choose him as the permanent 
supreme leader or whether a council of three clerics (very likely Khamenei, 
Rafsanjani and Ahmed Khomeini, the Imam's son) will be designated as the 
supreme political body. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to imagine any of these men ruling as Khomeini did for more than 10 
years. In addition to being immensely charismatic, Khomeini assumed state power 
with virtually unanimous support from the Iranian people. This historic 
beginning was indispensable to Khomeini retaining moral authority while his 
fundamentalist followers built the apparatus of terror and coercion for the 
emerging theocracy. It is doubtful that the principal organs of this apparatus, 
the Revolutionary Guards, the Komitehs and the Intelligence Ministry, would 
give another cleric the loyalty they so faithfully gave Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
The ayatollah was always anxious to preserve unity among his lieutenants, but 
at no point did he show any interest in organizing or energizing his followers 
for constructive purposes. He never made a statement in support of social 
welfare or economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else one might find in Khomeini's thought and behavior, it was hard to 
miss a vivacity for death and destruction in his attitude toward the world. 
This tendency had to be primarily understood as a personality trait of the 
ayatollah, because it certainly is not a distinct feature of Islam, Iranian 
political culture or the nature of its people. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Iran's most conspicuous failure during the decade has been in 
economics. Ten years ago the republic pledged to reduce dependence on oil as 
the principal source of foreign exchange. Yet today, dependence on oil exports 
is greater than it was during the shah's rule. Ironically, the original popular 
base for Islamic leadership, the urban poor and lower middle class, has 
suffered most from the deteriorating economic situation. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling religious leaders have defined their mission as moral and political, 
and have relegated economic policy to the background. Islam as a cultural and 
legal system may be an alternative to Western liberalism and Eastern communism, 
but it has virtually nothing to offer concerning the practical organization of 
economic life in the contemporary world. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the war with Iraq, however, many influential religious leaders 
seem to have realized that the rhetorical call for an Islamic economics has to 
be abandoned in favor of concrete, pragmatic policy options and programs. 
</P>
<P>
This is a very delicate task; the slightest suggestion that Islam might not 
have all the answers about a particular subject is likely, in the current 
atmosphere, to foment charges of blasphemy from fundamentalists. Rafsanjani and 
Khamenei are prominent among those wanting to move in a more technocratic 
direction. Whether they can prevail over the political and ideological 
objections of their leftist and rightist clerical rivals is difficult to assess 
at this point. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution has wrought, despite its repressive evolution, a number of 
powerful achievements likely to be of permanent benefit to Iran. For the first 
time in the nation's history, the gap between the elite and the masses has been 
significantly bridged. This is a positive development, despite the horrifying 
cruelty of the leadership. The revolution has liberated the country, once and 
for all, from the corrupt and exploitative character of dynastic politics. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution has also succeeded at ending foreign interference in the 
internal affairs of the country, a process that had humiliated Iran in a 
variety of respects for more than a century -- although, paradoxically, the 
current government is doing more harm to the well-being of the Iranian people 
on a daily basis than any of its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution has made Iranians far more conscious of secularism, pluralism 
and popular sovereignty -- the virtues of liberalism. The experience of 
theocracy has meant a systematic negation of such ideas and arrangements; it 
has given them, absent a new value, almost a glorious quality. Ordinary 
Iranians might not express their longings in these terms, but their aspiration 
for a less-regimented life has received abundant testimony, as has their 
growing hostility to the reliance on the symbols of Islam to validate 
repressive practices. 
</P>
<P>
What the future holds for Iran remains obscure. The revolution makes certain 
kinds of hopeful evolution more plausible than ever before, and yet it has also 
left extensive scar tissue on the Iranian body politic. Khomeini's brooding, 
dominating rule shaped our perceptions to such an extent that we need some time 
to adjust to the idea of life in Iran without him. 
</P>
<P>
The tenure of the ayatollah's theocracy, like his own life, may be unduly 
prolonged, but its eventual demise is just as inevitable. The atavism of the 
mullahs cannot withstand the challenge of time or the demands and aspirations 
of Iranian society. What remains a distant dream for the Iranian people is the 
experience of belonging to a democratic nation.

Both political parties have established "opposition research" teams to "collect 
potentially damaging information" on opponents in the next election (Part I, 
June 3). If the voters permit this perversion of the electoral process, they 
deserve the calamities that will ensue. 
</P>
<P>
It is little wonder that the U.S. has slipped in the ranks of world leadership 
when our candidates for high office are more concerned with lining their own 
pockets and besmirching their enemies than with confronting the important 
issues of the day, such as homelessness, injustice, hunger, nuclear 
proliferation, arms control, and economic dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
Our failure to solve these problems on terms favorable to our interests will 
lead to further erosion of our international standing, while the head of 
communications for the Republican Party smugly asserts that a mud-filled 
dossier on the opposition is "frankly the single best resource we can put in 
the hands of Republican candidates at all levels." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than starting their hand-wringing lamentations after the election, the 
American people (led perhaps by their self-appointed representatives of the 
press?) should demand that politicians quit acting like spoiled schoolchildren 
and begin debating the issues of global life and death. Registered voters 
should notify their respective party leaders that they will refuse to 
contribute to any candidate who spends more time and effort on mudslinging than 
on presenting positive answers to difficult issues. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the above" should become a viable alternative when faced with 
candidates who know more about each other's boudoirs than about the European 
Economic Community. 
</P>
<P>
Only by restoring some sense of what government is supposed to do will we 
regain the respect and admiration of the world. If congressmen would lift the 
public-opinion standing of their own institution, they could start by assuming 
the mantle of leadership they have been trampling in the dust.

Now that the national inquiry into the decade's unusually high incidence of 
real and alleged moral turpitude on the part of high-profile government and 
business figures has claimed two more victims (Wright and Coelho), we would do 
well to examine a theme touched on by Jack Beatty ("People's Party Sold to High 
Rollers," Op-Ed Page, June 2) -- namely that our present ethical framework is 
too narrow, and should be expanded to include those of our collective behaviors 
and attitudes that are profoundly harmful, but are not, as yet, considered 
"unethical." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty's contrast between Wright lining his pockets with relatively small 
change, and congressional funding of the unnecessary and brutal killing of 
Nicaraguan peasants is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
So is the 1981 decision of Alyeska Pipeline's managers (with the tacit assent 
of the oil industry) to scrap their emergency oil spill cleanup operation. If 
and when it happened, and regardless of its size, big oil's helmsmen clearly 
preferred the results of the recent spill in Alaska's Prince William sound to 
all other outcomes of their corporate stewardship (Exxon President W.D. 
Stevens' June 1 letter notwithstanding). 
</P>
<P>
The same can be said for General Motors' and Ford's efforts to reduce gasoline 
mileage standards, even as we face suffocation under the increasing greenhouse 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to analyze such behavior in ethical terms, as well as the usual 
"political" and "economic" euphemizing. As welcome and needed as the current 
focus on "obeying the rules" may be, our ethical maturity requires that we go 
beyond it, and look more deeply into our use of violence, and our relationship 
to future generations.

Beatty is right on target when he states that the Democratic Party "is losing 
its soul." For too long, Democrats have been feeding from the trough of big 
business in a futile attempt to keep up with the Republican Party. In a 
two-party system in which both parties are beholden to corporate America, who 
is left to speak up for the common people? 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party needs to return to its roots, and start to represent the 
vast majority of Americans who haven't profited from the prevalent greed, 
corruption and selfishness of the Reagan-Bush years.

Neither the media nor the Republican Party are responsible for "Donkeygate." 
Rather Wright and Coelho and all of the other Democrats who have shed crocodile 
tears over the so-called sleaze of the past few years, while wearing their 
mantle of pristine virtue and their holier-than-thou coronet, are solely 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The media should be proud, as should all citizens, that the First Amendment is 
not only intact but works. Keep it up and continue the bipartisan 
investigations.

Robert A. Jones' column ("Sayonara to the Best of California," Part I, May 30) 
on the selling and buying, by foreigners, of our best California real estate 
concludes that "This is a game we can no longer afford." Wrong! We could afford 
it, but we choose to spend what should be our savings on fancy toys, rich men's

In fact, we cannot afford them either.

which must be paid for by long-term borrowing.

PREPAREDNESS MAY PAY

Industry officials take some pride in their readiness to cope with an oil spill 
off the California coast. One consortium maintains three oil-spill response 
ships with booms to control the spreading oil and skimmers to scoop up the goo 
before it can foul California beaches. But recent studies by local, state and 
federal agencies demonstrate that most of the state's 1,200-mile coastline is 
virtually defenseless against a major spill. Even where ships are available, an 
accident easily could overwhelm any containment and cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
California's first defense is to make certain that such an accident does not 
happen. But even in the aftermath of the Alaskan spill, the actions of federal 
officials who control the sea lanes are not confidence-inspiring. The U.S. 
Coast Guard recently proposed creation of a 5-mile-wide ship corridor in 
federal waters between San Francisco and Los Angeles that would be free of 
obstructions such as offshore oil rigs. But the Interior Department objected 
that such a "fairway" would interfere with the department's plans for leasing 
offshore tracts for oil and gas development. 
</P>
<P>
So now the Coast Guard is considering an alternate plan of two 1-mile-wide 
fairways separated by a 2-mile-wide median in which platforms could be built. 
Thus, oil supertankers that take miles to stop or turn sharply would have to 
thread their way north and south via one-mile wide lanes flanked on either side 
by oil platforms. A Coast Guard official in Washington has told The Times that 
a 5-mile, ship-traffic corridor would be overkill. 
</P>
<P>
But if it takes overkill to err on the side of caution, so be it. Consider the 
alternative: A 10-million-gallon spill from a tanker aground on Pt. Arena would 
reach San Francisco Bay in a week, Monterey in 20 days and Morro Bay in a 
month. One at Pt. Conception would put crude oil on the beaches of Malibu 
within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Stringent traffic control is the simplest and most-quickly obtainable defense 
against a collision and spill. Radar and satellite-navigation systems to 
control ship movements are readily available. There is no excuse for failing to 
implement such a program immediately.

ON ONE SIDE THE NIHILISTS, ON ANOTHER A NIGHTMARE; A BUDGET LIES IN BETWEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GARAMENDI, State Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) is chairman of 
the Revenue and Taxation Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislature and the governor have a unique opportunity to restore public 
confidence in government as they get ready to pass the state budget this month. 
Or we can blow it again. 
</P>
<P>
Our record needs improvement. We need look back only as far as last November, 
when voters were asked to sift through five competing insurance reform measures 
-- a job that should have been done in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Now before us is a more fundamental challenge: to relieve a real funding crisis 
in the state. Even through we have a sudden $2.5-billion surplus, we are 
hamstrung in spending it by the combination of an outdated spending limit and 
the implementation of Proposition 98, last year's voter-approved guarantee of 
funding for education. In the meantime, we continue to have growing 
transportation and health-care problems that need our attention. 
</P>
<P>
There are several scenarios that, if played out, invite major failure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The nihilists would sacrifice gains for health care, mental health, 
community services and other crucial programs to award all available surplus 
funds to education. Their argument is that Proposition 98 was so onerous and 
unmanageable that the people should suffer its consequences. Then surely, next 
time around the people would destroy the monster by repealing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the damage that occurs in the meantime to a host of other 
services already strained to capacity? 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of such a nonsolution would be a civil war between competing 
programs. Fortunately, this is an outcome that even the education community is 
seeking to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Republicans would tie any reasonable budget compromise to elimination of 
cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for health and welfare programs. This idea 
drags out an issue that has divided the Legislature along partisan lines for 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason for having COLAs is to prevent the budget from being balanced 
on the backs of the least fortunate. In tight budget cycles, COLAs are 
suspended, as they have been in three of the last 10 years. In the world of a 
$2.5-billion surplus, COLAs are not relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some legislators would eliminate the current spending limit in exchange for 
a limit on revenues by requiring voters to approve any and all tax increases. 
Not only would this represent a complete abdication of responsibility by the 
Legislature, it also opens the floodgates to passing off more and more issues 
to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
This irresponsible and impractical idea would create an unworkable ballot. Last 
year, the Legislature considered almost 300 proposals dealing with taxes, tax 
credits, tax deductions or rebates. The governor signed 80% of the proposals 
that reached his desk -- a total of 98 measures enacted into law. 
</P>
<P>
Most voters thought that the record number of propositions on last November's 
ballot (29) was outrageous. Try to imagine voting on 100 tax proposals! 
</P>
<P>
We must avoid any of these outcomes. In the days ahead, the Legislature and the 
governor must balance the needs and agendas of competing interests and hammer 
out a viable fiscal structure for California. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, there is good news: All of the elements necessary for a compromise are 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's consensus-building approach in dealing with the spending limit, 
Proposition 98 and transportation funding represents a breath of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans' decision to refrain from calling for an immediate rebate of 
unanticipated revenues is an acknowledgement of the near-desperate state of 
vital needs, like roads. 
</P>
<P>
The business community has rallied to deal with the problem posed by the state 
spending limit. Their Project '90 coalition includes labor, charitable and 
community organizations and transportation interests. This broad spectrum 
reduces the prospects for a repeat of last year's divisive battles over two 
unsuccessful spending limit initiatives, Propositions 71 and 72. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and education leaders have taken a 
thoughtful approach, which ensures that the gains of Proposition 98 don't come 
at the expense of other services. 
</P>
<P>
Now if we can put our ideas together and sort out our differences, we just 
might prove that representative government can work in California.

FAST CARS, TEDIOUS TRAFFIC 
</P>

<TEXT>

Paul Dean's recent article about the Corvette ZR-1 was of particular interest 
to me because of the "ZR-1's favorite party trick" of going from zero to 100 
m.p.h. and back to a dead stop in 14 seconds. With this capability, the ZR-1 
would be the ideal vehicle for an automated freeway ("For Just $50,000 Leave a 
Ferrari in Your Rear-View Mirror," May 26). 
</P>
<P>
Controlled roadbeds have been discussed for at least 50 years (the 1939 World 
Fair had an exhibit), but never implemented. An automated freeway is based on 
the conclusion that our existing transportation system using independent motor 
vehicles cannot be optimized. For example, we assume that entering vehicles 
will not slow down the system. On-ramps are designed to allow acceleration, yet 
we see vehicles enter at reduced speed. A ZR-1 in an automatic system could be 
directed to accelerate from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in a little over four seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway system in Southern California does not now work satisfactorily and 
it is getting worse. Car-pool lanes are only a minor improvement. Why not try a 
controlled ultra-high-speed lane of vehicles with the performance of a ZR-1?

UNEQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW FOR THERESA SALDANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I reacted in horror to your article, "A Crime Without End." This nightmare does 
not belong to Theresa Saldana alone. While it may affect her most directly, it 
is shared by us all. Therefore, I direct this open letter to every elected 
official of the State of California: 
</P>
<P>
Shame on you! The principal function of a government is to protect the people 
it represents. You have abrogated your responsibilities. If the legislature, 
administration and judiciary cannot, either singly or together, protect us from 
a convicted felon with documented mental instabilities and a self-professed 
intent to commit further mayhem, then it is time for all of you to resign so 
that we may elect other, more competent public servants.

FURY OVER THE FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Fountainhead of a New Fury": Why was there so little mention of Ayn Rand's 
philosophical work? Why was there no mention of the Ayn Rand Society, a branch 
of the American Philosophical Assn. (an organization of university 
philosophers, with similar branches for Plato, Aristotle, David Hume and 
others)? Or of the Ayn Rand Institute, right here in Marina del Rey, which 
conducts a yearly essay contest on "The Fountainhead" for high school juniors 
and seniors, and which sponsors academic work in philosophy? 
</P>
<P>
I was glad to see her described as a "consistent (and) passionate champion of 
individual rights," but there is a lot more to Ayn Rand than politics. Ayn Rand 
provided new and important insights into the nature of reason and its role in 
human life, into morality and the important questions traditionally answered by 
religion. Especially with more and more people turning to fundamentalism, 
Shirley MacLaine, "crystal power," and drug cults for meaning in life, Ayn 
Rand's rational, benevolent message deserves better than to be carelessly 
dismissed as adolescent foolishness.

A PIGLET TALE RECALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This Little Piggy Can Come to Your House" by David Larsen (June 1) brought 
back memories of more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
We had just finished building a house -- much with our own hands. It was north 
of Foothill in Arcadia and we had two daughters, two horses, two dogs and two 
cats. 
</P>
<P>
My littlest daughter became very ill. Then one day a farmer friend brought her 
a tiny runt piglet. It was like a miracle -- she was soon out and teaching it 
tricks. 
</P>
<P>
"Rusty" -- his coat was a rusty brown -- was soon housebroken, slept on her bed 
and was as clean as could be and very quick to learn. He even met the school 
bus every day. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty grew slowly at first, but finally developed into a 500-pound porker and 
we had to get rid of him.

FOOTLOOSE: MONACO IS A SPIN OF THE WHEEL AWAY

MONTE CARLO, Monaco 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the glistening yacht riding at anchor in the protected harbor, several 
Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and Lamborghinis parked before the luxe Hotel de Paris, 
and the crowd at an open-air cafe across the square dressed mainly by Saville 
Row and couturier salons, it's easy to get the idea that money makes the world 
go round in Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
And so it used to be in the 19th and early 20th centuries when Monaco was 
almost a naughty word, thanks to the high-stakes casino gambling and other 
extravagances favored here at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But war and taxes took their toll, and Monaco turned to other sources of 
revenue. Gambling is now way down on the list behind real estate, banking and 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, stories still abound of lucky streaks at the tables, such as that 
of an Englishman who got on a fabulous roll and ended up almost owning the 
place. But that was in 1891 . . . and he blew it all the next season. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Air France nonstop to Paris, UTA the same from San Francisco. 
Other domestic and foreign carriers will also get you to Paris. Take Air Inter 
or Air France on down to Nice. Monte Carlo is 13 miles from the Nice airport, 
and a helicopter will whisk you here for $50 U.S., about the same as cab fare. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Two days should do it, as Monaco is not noted for its 
beaches. Even without the high rollers in residence, Monte Carlo can hardly be 
called inexpensive, with food and lodging costs above those of neighboring 
France. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The French franc is currency here, recently selling at six 
per dollar, or about 16 cents each. Summer temperatures are usually in the high 
70s; in winter it's seldom colder than the 50s and high 40s. Easter and August 
are terribly crowded. There's a fine bus system, a ride costing 85 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hotel du Louvre (16 Blvd. des Moulins; $93 to $116 double, 
B&amp;B) is a small, pretty place in the center of things near the casino. 
Bright marble floors set off Oriental rugs in the lobby, and the antique clock, 
shelves of books and huge vases of flowers give the place a feeling of an old 
manor house. Bedrooms are most comfortable, those with sea views more 
expensive. Breakfast only. 
</P>
<P>
Le Siecle (10 Ave. Prince Pierre; $83-$115, double, depending on season), near 
the railway station, is a modern place with a plain lobby and bedrooms 
furnished in traditional ways. Double windows shield you from street noise. The 
dining room serves a fixed luncheon daily for $11; dinners go for $15. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Welcome (Villefranche-sur-Mer; $78-103, B&amp;B, double) is about five 
miles east down the coast in France, a charming little hotel right on a tiny 
port. We've known it for years. The St. Pierre restaurant here rates a mention 
in Gault Millau, while the St. Pierre chapel just out the front door was 
decorated by Jean Cocteau, a frequent visitor to the hotel. Villefranche is a 
good base for visiting Monaco and Nice. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Just getting started on a meal in Monaco should 
delight anyone. Begin with a piece of garlic bread spread with tapenade, a 
paste of chopped black olives, olive oil and plenty of spices. Perhaps a 
zucchini tart, or the Provencal pissaladiere, a pizza with fried onions, black 
olives and anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
Pistou is a vegetable soup laced with basil and popular all along the Cote 
d'Azur, while a creamed mussel soup with vegetables and saffron is no less 
favored. 
</P>
<P>
Just about anything that swims appears on Monacan menus, usually prepared as in 
neighboring France or Italy. And few menus skip tripe dishes and lamb; both are 
delicious. They, like the seafood, go well with Provencal wines. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Any dish mentioned above, plus another 40 or so dishes and 
desserts, can be had at Le Pistou (Loews Monte Carlo Hotel, Avenue Spelugues), 
long noted for its regional-food-only policy. Even the decor is Provencal 
rustic in this attractive setting, with a five-course spread going for $35. Le 
Pistou is right over the water, and the view at sunset is lovely. Musicians add 
a festive air, playing Monegasque and Italian folk music. 
</P>
<P>
L'Estragon (6 Rue Emile de Loth) is on the Old Town hill, an old-fashioned 
place with Monegasque-Provencal decor as well as an outdoor terrace-garden. The 
folks here are very helpful, leading you through menus that feature dishes from 
$7 to $16. The $11 luncheon might start with salad nicoise, then go on to main 
dishes of pork, chicken, steak or an omelet with vegetables, ending with fruit 
or a fine selection of cheeses. L'Estragon is just down a narrow street from 
the Royal Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe de Paris (Place du Casino) is definitely the place to see and be seen. 
Because it's open daily for 22 hours from 8 a.m., people stop in for meals, 
afternoon drinks or coffee any time. The crowd is an eclectic one, with 
visiting celebrities, local swells, businessmen and just plain folks from town 
or afar. 
</P>
<P>
The ambiance is belle epoque, which is the era it dates from, with light coming 
through the greenhouse ceiling to fall on marble walls, ebony box seating and 
stained-glass windows of the four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A menu lets you choose anything from a croque-monsieur (toasted ham and cheese 
sandwich) for $7.50 on up to a filet de boeuf au poivre for $24, with 
interesting stops along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Hotel de Paris (Place du Casino; $216-$365) comes very close 
to being the ne plus ultra of European hotels, a palace of opulence built in 
1864 that is equally ornate in its wedding-cake facade and Empire drawing 
rooms. The Louis XV dining room is blessed with two Michelin stars, and the 
decor lives up to its royal name. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Palace Hotel (Roquebrune-Cap Martin; $183-$216) clings to a cliff high 
above Monte Carlo just over the eastern border with France, two miles by 
twisting streets from the city center. After years of benign neglect as a 
family- owned enterprise, Vista Palace has been taken over and renovated into a 
sparkling jewel of modern design and boasts every conceivable amenity. 
</P>
<P>
The view down to Monte Carlo and the coast is spectacular, particularly at 
night, and Le Vistaero restaurant has moved quickly into contention for highest 
honors along the Cote d'Azur. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Monaco Ville is the Old Town on a hill, Monte Carlo is the new 
city across the port. Take a stroll through the former, making sure to time 
your visit for a changing of the guard at the Royal Palace. Then go to the 
nearby neo-Romanesque cathedral where Princess Grace is buried; her tomb is 
usually covered with flowers from adoring monegasques. 
</P>
<P>
While up on the hill, visit the Oceanographic Museum and Aquarium, one of 
Europe's finest. Back in Monte Carlo, be sure to see the fascinating Doll 
Museum (17 Ave. Princess Grace). Monaco's Exotic Gardens are also worthy of a 
stop and feature more than 7,000 varieties of succulents and other exotic 
plants in a beautiful rock setting. 
</P>
<P>
To have a flutter at chemin de fer or just to watch, walk through the casino, a 
study in rococo built in 1878 with all the excesses of the era. The 
one-arm-bandits' room opens at 10 a.m. and admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Monaco Government Tourist Office at (212) 
759-5227, or write (845 3rd Ave., New York 10022) for a map and brochures on 
sights, things to do, hotels, restaurants and shopping.

DINING OUT: SEAFOOD DISHES APLENTY ON THE ISLAND OF MADEIRA 
</P>

FUNCHAL, Madeira 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a contender for the ugliest fish in the ocean, but espada, the local 
specialty of Madeira, is one of the world's great seafoods. 
</P>
<P>
By itself, the fish is reason enough to visit this Portuguese island some 350 
miles off the coast of North Africa, but Madeira has a wealth of local dishes 
you can't get anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"The only place you can find espada (black scabbard fish) is in the cold, very 
deep waters of the Bay of Funchal," said Virgilio Gavina, chef and owner of 
Golfinho, a seafood restaurant in Funchal's old and cobblestoned fishermen's 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, his restaurant is a nautical fantasy of portholes, metal ship's doors 
and even an indoor pool surrounding the bar, but we chose to eat on the front 
patio, where the afternoon sun filtered through a yellow-and-blue awning. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in the bustling, open-air market, we'd come face to fin with an espada 
-- a long, black fish with a perpetual frown -- and were eager to try it. But 
first came sopa de peixe, a robust fish soup made with onion, tomato, garlic 
and pepper, and served with traditional Madeiran bread made with sweet potato. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to French bread, the small round loaf had a heavier, moister texture, 
and the sweet potato added a pleasing richness. 
</P>
<P>
The next course was polvo a Virgilio -- octopus cooked in white wine and olive 
oil and served in a piquant sauce of tomato, bay leaves, garlic and onion. 
Tender and smooth in texture, the octopus was not rubbery, and the sauce 
achieved a nice balance of sour and sweet flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the espada, prepared in the traditional Madeiran manner -- dipped in 
egg batter, sauteed and served with fried bananas. The light, delicate white 
fish was moist, sweet and absolutely fresh. Accompaniments were rice with red 
peppers and French-fried potatoes enhanced with a light touch of garlic. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert we had Madeira cake, made with molasses, cinnamon, nuts and Madeira 
wine. Topped with a big dollop of creme fraiche, the cake was delicious, but we 
could eat only a few calorie-laden bites. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional bolo de mel (a kind of fruitcake) is even richer," said 
Gavina, noting that we weren't even making a dent in the portion. "Madeiran 
families make it at home on holidays. It would be too heavy for most visitors, 
so we serve a lighter version at the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Our meal cost 3,300 escudos per person (about $20 U.S. at the current exchange 
rate of 156 to the dollar). 
</P>
<P>
Gavina, who with his wife Teresa has operated Golfinho for 12 years, learned 
his culinary skills from his father, Raul Gavina, who owns the family's other 
seafood restaurant, Gavina's. 
</P>
<P>
On the Lido, just to the east of downtown Funchal, it's built right over the 
water. The day's catch is displayed in a windowed refrigerator at the front of 
the restaurant. When ordering, walk up, pick out the fish you want and tell the 
waiter how you want it cooked. 
</P>
<P>
We chose fresh sardines, which came grilled in olive oil and were served with 
French-fried potatoes cooked with tiny bits of fresh garlic. A typical lunch 
costs $7 to $10. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite seafood is bife de atum, tuna steak. We tried some at 
Caravela, a modern restaurant on the main boulevard along the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting by the window in this second-story restaurant, we looked out on the 
sunlit ocean as we tried caldo verde, a traditional cabbage and ham soup that 
was similar to a potato soup, with finely shredded, dark-green cabbage and 
large chunks of smoked ham. 
</P>
<P>
The tuna steaks came in thinly sliced fillets that had been marinated in 
Madeira wine, garlic, vinegar and spices, and cooked in olive oil. Lunch or 
dinner here will cost about $10 per person. 
</P>
<P>
While local seafood forms a mainstay of Madeiran cuisine, a dish for special 
occasions is espetada. Everyone says the best is served at Celeiro Restaurant, 
on a side street in the heart of Funchal. Descending a few steps, we found 
ourselves in a dimly lit cellar restaurant with white stucco walls and huge log 
beams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Garlic and Parsley 
</P>
<P>
The espetada consisted of large chunks of beef that had been seasoned with 
garlic and parsley and skewered on twigs of laurel. The meat was tender and 
juicy, infused with the flavors and aroma of laurel and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, we had veludo, a pudding of milk and eggs topped with caramelized 
sugar and raisins. It was similar to Spanish flan, but as with all desserts in 
Madeira, it is very rich. Meals here cost about $10 per person. 
</P>
<P>
To sample all of these Madeiran specialties, try A Seta, in the hills above 
Funchal, about a $5 cab ride from the center of town. If you go early in the 
evening, you risk running into bus tours, but don't let that dissuade you. 
</P>
<P>
Go later and dine with the Funchal residents who start arriving around nine to 
dine on the authentic local dishes. The sweet potato bread we had there was 
freshly made and served warm, and the espada was sweet and tender. 
</P>
<P>
Onion and tomato soup was made with fresh tomatoes and served in the 
traditional manner -- with a perfectly poached egg in each bowl. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iron Skewers 
</P>
<P>
Here the espetada was served on long iron skewers and included chicken as well 
as beef. We also tried bacalhau, cod fish that had been soaked in cold water 
for at least 24 hours, then simmered for two to three hours in more water and 
finally cooked in olive oil and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the local dishes we tried, it was the least appealing, very oily and 
slightly bitter. But we liked the other specialties, including inhame, sweet 
potato flavored with garlic, and milho frito, a polenta-like dish made of corn 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment begins about 8 p.m. and includes fado (Portuguese ballads sung to 
guitar music) and traditional songs and dances. Dinner here will cost about $10 
per person. 
</P>
<P>
No trip to Madeira would be complete without stops at two local landmarks. The 
Apolo cafe is on the main promenade in the center of town. For years it has 
been the local gathering place for artists and writers. 
</P>
<P>
Sit outdoors under one of the striped umbrellas and watch the people pass by 
while you sip a cup of rich, freshly roasted coffee with steamed milk and a 
bolo de arroz, a slightly sweet roll. 
</P>
<P>
The other great tradition on the island is afternoon tea at Reid's Hotel. Built 
in 1890, Reid's is elegant and very British. From 4 to 6 p.m. every day, tea is 
served on a veranda that offers dazzling views of the Bay of Funchal. 
</P>
<P>
We sat in rattan chairs at a table set with white linen, as the waiter wheeled 
up a trolley with an array of cakes, including a ginger cake, fragrant with 
spices, and a moist fruitcake. Tea for two, including the cakes, bread and jam, 
cost about $12. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone likes the fabled local wine, Madeira, but this is the place to try 
it. It comes in four varieties. Sercial is the driest and is often served as an 
aperitif. Verdelho is medium dry, Boal is semi-sweet and fruity, and Malmsey is 
a very sweet after-dinner drink. 
</P>
<P>
You can taste all these varieties, tour the operation and buy wine to take home 
at the Sao Francisco Wine Lodges in the center of Funchal.

"Look down there," our pilot shouted, trying to make himself heard over the 
roar of the engine. "It's a pod of killer whales heading north."

As he dipped one wing we could see five of the black-and-white whales 1,000

Six of us had taken off at dawn from Seattle's Lake Washington for a weekend of 
salmon fishing in British Columbia's Inside Passage.

For the aviation buffs among us, getting there was half the fun because many of 
the fishing resorts along the Inside Passage can be reached only by float

Powered by a big (and noisy) radial engine, the planes cruise at a bit more 
than 100 m.p.h. The route north from Seattle is low and slow, ideal for 
sightseeing as you pass over tugs towing rafts and freighters steaming along 
Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Island Resorts 
</P>
<P>
After a customs stop at Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, we flew to the resorts 
around Stuart and Sonora islands. 
</P>
<P>
The half-dozen resorts, plus more than a dozen others clustered around Campbell 
River, Desolation Sound and on the islands off the northern tip of Vancouver 
Island, offer a salmon experience that includes accommodations, meals, boat, 
license, tackle and guide for one price. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing is from small boats with light tackle -- a real challenge when you hook 
one of the 40-pound-plus types for which these waters are famous. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're looking for something a bit more difficult, try qualifying for 
the Tyee Club at April Point Lodge, where you must land a salmon of more than 
30 pounds on light tackle from a wooden boat powered only by oars. 
</P>
<P>
We headed for an area called "The Drain," where the tide rips through at 10 to 
13 knots. 
</P>
<P>
Steep forested mountains rose nearly sheer from the water to several thousand 
feet on either side of the half-mile-wide channel. Our guide kept the boat 
headed into the current at half-throttle. Water rushed by like a giant river. 
Huge whirlpools roiled suddenly alongside, then just as suddenly subsided. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bald Eagles 
</P>
<P>
An eight-foot waterfall in the middle of the channel was created by a submerged 
rock. When we would go through this area in the afternoon it would be falling 
the other way, the tide change is so great. Bald eagles perched in the trees 
and sea birds wheeled overhead. 
</P>
<P>
These resorts are small, accommodating from half a dozen to about 30 guests, 
but facilities are modern and comfortable, often including a hot tub or sauna. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sea Lion Rock Lodge we sat down to the belt-bursting repast that 
proprietress Hazel Stephenson serves to guests on their last night at the 
lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Cold appetizers began with cod ceviche, raw oysters and giant prawns. Each was 
served a whole Dungeness crab, poached salmon, baked cod, a bucket of steamer 
clams and heaping platters of deep-fried oysters and prawns -- all of it caught 
within two hours of reaching the table. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning we flew into Farewell Harbor Resort on the rugged shore of 
300-acre Berry Island next to Queen Charlotte Strait. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of small islands dot these waters. They are so placid in summer that the 
resort is used as a base for kayaking trips to watch whales. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours of patient trolling paid off with several lovely salmon, 
including a 37-pound chinook. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Fishing season in the Vancouver area begins in May and lasts through September. 
Float plane pilots will carry your fish back in the plane's hollow pontoons. 
They'll radio ahead to have canners, smokers or shippers meet you on return. 
Kenmore Air operates the float planes. 
</P>

HEALDSBURG, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although this quiet town on the Russian River was named for a trader in pioneer 
times, today its name is more likely to be associated with canoeing and wine 
tasting. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the favorite activities of summertime visitors, who also are drawn to 
the area by its country inns and excellent restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
At Trowbridge Recreation, near the river, rent a canoe to explore the rural and 
redwood scenery of Sonoma County. Then exchange your paddle for a stemmed glass 
to sample the region's fine wines, including the champagnes of Korbel and Piper 
Sonoma. A seasonal highlight at the century-old Korbel Champagne Cellars is a 
tour of its re-created antique rose garden. 
</P>
<P>
Also popular is a horse-drawn surrey ride through vineyards in Alexander 
Valley. You'll end the outing with a barbecue lunch or dinner while sipping 
local vintages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wooded Estate 
</P>
<P>
On a hill overlooking Healdsburg is the Madrona Manor, an eight-acre wooded 
estate that makes an elegant headquarters for your visit. Its focal point is an 
1881 three-story Victorian mansion that Carol and John Muir and family 
renovated as a country inn seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now on the National Register of Historic Places, Madrona Manor has 20 spacious 
guest rooms in the mansion plus a separate carriage house, kitchen building and 
garden cottage. A team of gardeners tends the tree-shaded grounds, which 
features a swimming pool and sunbathing area. 
</P>
<P>
All rooms have private bath and include bathrobes and slippers. Nightly rates 
are $93/$135 and include a bountiful breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
The inn's chefs also create prix fixe and a la carte menus for delicious 
dinners served nightly in the mansion's dining rooms and on the terrace. Sunday 
brunch is offered to guests and the public from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Phone (707) 
433-4231 for meal or room reservations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
B&amp;Bs Abound 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen other bed and breakfast inns are in the area. They range from the 
nine-room Healdsburg Inn on the Plaza, in a turn-of-the-century Wells Fargo 
building, to four white cottages of the rural Belle de Jour Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Begin your visit with a stop at the chamber of commerce, which is open daily. 
Call toll-free (800) 648-9922. While you are there, pick up a list of lodgings 
as well as a restaurant guide. To get there, take the Healdsburg Avenue exit 
off U.S. 101 and continue north to the office at No. 217. 
</P>
<P>
On the way, you'll see stacks of canoes and the office of W. C. (Bob) 
Trowbridge at 20 Healdsburg Ave. His family-run Trowbridge Recreation has been 
renting canoes and organizing trips on the Russian River and other waterways 
for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Trowbridge offers a choice of eight one-day canoe trips. The shortest is a 
five-mile paddle through the redwoods that takes two to three hours and costs 
$22 per canoe. The others cost $32 per canoe, cover up to 16 miles and take as 
long as seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
Trips also can be combined for canoe outings lasting two to five days. Register 
at the Trowbridge office the morning of the trip, then pick up paddles and life 
jackets before departing. A deposit is required to make a reservation; phone 
(707) 433-7247 for details. 
</P>
<P>
Also make reservations for a leisurely horse-drawn tour through vineyards in 
Alexander Valley. Harnesses jingle on a pair of draft horses as they pull a 
surrey with fringe on the top past rows of grapevines to tasting rooms at two 
wineries. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-hour tours get under way at Johnson's Alexander Valley Winery, an 
unpretentious family-run winery off California 128, a few miles east of town. 
You'll also return there for an outdoor barbecue lunch or dinner and more wine 
tasting. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of the surrey ride with wines and a meal is $40 per person; no children 
permitted. Call (707) 433-2422 to reserve with the surrey drivers and tour 
guides, Sue and Greg Hannan of Five Oaks Farm. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find other wineries along Westside Road that runs southwest from 
Healdsburg to River Road and the Korbel Champagne Cellars. Guided tours and 
tastings are offered daily at this historic winery, which shipped its first 
bottle of bubbly in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
Now open for the 10th season, the restored antique rose garden surrounds the 
old summer house of the Korbel family. Summer tour hours of the hillside garden 
are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., daily except Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
South of Healdsburg, on Old Redwood Highway at Eastside Road, is Piper Sonoma 
Cellars, the California home of French champagne maker Piper Heidsieck since 
1982. There are daily tours and tastings of traditionally made sparkling wines. 
</P>
<P>
By calling (707) 433-8843 you can reserve a light lunch at Piper Sonoma 
Cellars, or go north of Healdsburg for a more extensive meal at Chateau 
Souverain. The winery and its remodeled restaurant are just off U.S. 101; exit 
west at Independence Lane. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish lunches are served Tuesday through Saturday, dinners Thursday through 
Saturday. Make reservations as well for the winery's Sunday buffet brunch 
that's available from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Phone (707) 433-3141. 
</P>
<P>
A popular place for picnics as well as water sports is Lake Sonoma, a reservoir 
created by Warm Springs Dam in 1983. You can rent ski boats, sailboats, paddle 
boats, windsurfers and canoes. Exit from U.S. 101 on Canyon Road to Dry Creek 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
For a look at local history, visit the Healdsburg Museum at 132 Matheson St., 
just beyond the town plaza. Exhibits range from Pomo Indian baskets to vintage 
firearms and Victorian clothing. Hours are noon to 5 p.m., Tuesday through 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month the museum will be moved to 221 Matheson St. Free concerts are 
given in the plaza on summer Sundays from 1 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The shortest route to Healdsburg from Los Angeles is north on Interstate 5 and 
east on Interstate 580, which skirts San Francisco and joins U.S. 101 north at 
San Rafael. Round trip is 882 miles.

I take exception with Mr. Shakespeare. For me, there's a lot in a name. 
</P>
<P>
A rose might smell as sweet if it were called ornithogalum, but would it 
inspire poetry? 
</P>
<P>
Would I sigh as much over Bora Bora if the island had been named Cook, after 
the intrepid captain? 
</P>
<P>
Would I have stood in line so eagerly for the movie "On Golden Pond" if it had 
been called "On Squam Lake" for the New Hampshire setting where it was filmed? 
</P>
<P>
I doubt it. The rhythm of names has always lured me on. 
</P>
<P>
Tegucigalpa. Tlaquepaque. Katmandu. Mombasa. Zihuatanejo. 
</P>
<P>
Of those, Zihuatanejo remains the most intriguing, as I have not yet been 
there. 
</P>
<P>
For a while I suspected that vowels might be the secret factor in my travel 
plans. But a friend from Toledo, Ohio, assures me that vowels alone do not 
guarantee a dreamy destination. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I could never resist a mountain called Kilimanjaro, a lake called 
Titicaca, a town called Wuxi. I would go extra miles to see a beach named 
Kaanapali, a volcano named Popocatepetl, an island named Bali or Corfu. The 
compelling stone calvaries of Brittany are in villages with complex names -- 
Plougastel-Daolas is worth a detour. 
</P>
<P>
As I drive in California on a rainy day, glorious sounds tumble through my 
mind: Abu Simbel, Addis Ababa, Asuncion, Bodo, Bombay, Chipping Campden, 
Concarneau, Dar es Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
The whoosh of traffic fades as I take fanciful journeys to Delphi, Hokitika, 
Jujuy, Kandy, Kyoto, Izmir, Ipanema, Marrakech, Maracaibo. 
</P>
<P>
The light changes and I am off to Nova Levante, Novosibirsk, Riyadh, Rovaniemi, 
Santiago de Compostela, Srinigar, Tashkent, Valparaiso, Wollongong, Yalta, Zell 
am See. 
</P>
<P>
It is a miracle that I ever get anywhere, with all that lovely distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving on a trip I whisper names in practice and anticipation; 
afterward they glimmer in my head at the most outrageous times. 
</P>
<P>
A cactus in a nursery reminds me of the thorny shrubs that are used to form 
natural corrals near Casablanca. A simple basket reminds me of three Indian 
weavers I met in Punta Arenas, as well as a Lapp in Lapland. 
</P>
<P>
Music underscores memories. I used to smile at the tune "Managua, Nicaragua." I 
was a pushover for "Old Cape Cod." I searched Irish road maps for Gloccamorra, 
until a pub keeper in Limerick told me that he couldn't say how things were 
there since the village was invented by a New York songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
Books -- both fiction and nonfiction -- fire up the urge to travel. I even 
spend time reading atlases, and cluck with satisfaction to learn that Kuala 
means river mouth or estuary, which is why so many Malaysian towns have that 
first name. Bad means bath or spa -- which explains all the Bad names in 
Germany and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if you knew all the foreign terms for hill, swamp, cape, dune, 
mountain and bay, you could translate a lot of the world map. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in all the United States there is only one town named Rose (Nebraska). 
</P>
<P>
There is no Ornithogalum.

MYSTERY OF NEWGRANGE STONES MAY BE IN THE STARS

DUBLIN, Ireland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few places in Ireland are as mysterious as Newgrange, the ancient hilltop stone 
chamber 30 miles north of Dublin in the Boyne Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Newgrange, which dates from 2,000 BC, was built by the country's original 
neolithic inhabitants. Unlike Stonehenge, the well-known series of 
free-standing stones in England, Newgrange is an enclosed structure of 
highly-decorated stones with an earthen roof. 
</P>
<P>
It is accessible from Dublin in summer by daily bus service. The bus leaves 
Dublin's Busaris Station on Amiens Street at 10 a.m. and returns at 6:30 p.m. 
every day between May and September. The round-trip journey costs 10 Irish 
(about $16 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
On my November visit there was no direct service to Newgrange, so I settled for 
the morning bus to the nearest town, Slane, about five miles away. 
</P>
<P>
I got off the bus a few blocks from the center of Slane, a picturesque town 
with restful pubs and gracefully curved stone bridges that span the Boyne 
River. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slane Castle 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from the bus stop, Slane Castle peered out from behind 
stately trees. Privately owned by Lord Henry Mountcharles, the castle has been 
the site of Ireland's biggest summer concerts, including those of David Bowie, 
the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Queen and Bruce Springsteen. 
</P>
<P>
U2, Ireland's highly successful band, recorded its fourth album, "The 
Unforgettable Fire," in a makeshift studio inside the castle. But on this 
chilly, overcast morning, Slane was quiet. 
</P>
<P>
As I walked up a lonely country road it began to rain. Cars passed infrequently 
and I started to wonder if anything of real interest even existed in this 
deserted countryside. While most of Ireland is well marked with directional 
signs, few indicated the way to Newgrange. 
</P>
<P>
More popular tourist attractions such as the Ring of Kerry and the Blarney 
Stone lie in the opposite direction from Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
As I walked a couple of more miles, the rain invaded my raincoat and penetrated 
my clothing. I tried to shake off the chill, pulling my hood down over my 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disc-like Promontory 
</P>
<P>
What I saw in the field to my left sent a shiver along my spine. On top of the 
gently rolling green field was a sight that I will never forget: a disc-like 
promontory of land, outlined in white. 
</P>
<P>
Newgrange was larger and more imposing than I had ever imagined. The stone 
structure looked at once old and new, like a '50s sci-fi version of a flying 
saucer. 
</P>
<P>
The small visitor center at the entrance to Newgrange was staffed by a former 
schoolteacher who now worked as a guide. 
</P>
<P>
Surprised to see me arrive on foot, she explained that I was her first 
English-speaking visitor of the day; she had had only French and German 
tourists, who arrived by car. 
</P>
<P>
As I entered the front gate she told me to explore the hill on my own and that 
she would join me in a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Curved Earthen Roof 
</P>
<P>
Rough white rocks, interspersed with occasional round black rocks, cover the 
exterior of the 150-foot circular mound. The walls rise 15 feet from the ground 
and then angle inward, where they join the curved earthen roof. 
</P>
<P>
Newgrange is encircled by a series of rocks, 10 feet long and 3 feet high, 
uniformly laid end to end to form a low wall around the structure. All these 
large stones are intricately cut with repeated designs of concentric circles, 
wavy lines and abstract images. 
</P>
<P>
A few yards downhill from the entrance a series of standing stones, some as 
high as 12 feet, stand like sentinels. Despite their rough surfaces the stones 
seem to arch gracefully toward the sky, like young plants seeking the sun. 
</P>
<P>
The cavelike entrance is covered by a large rock slab, with a small windowlike 
opening directly overhead. A modern wooden stairway has been built to allow 
access over the large stones to the entrance. Another modern addition is an 
iron gate, which the former teacher had come to unlock for me. 
</P>
<P>
Newgrange did not seem to be designed for tall people. I had to crouch to get 
through a twisting, 50-foot passageway. In the very center of the structure the 
ceiling vaulted up to a stone roof that was at least 20 feet high. It would 
have been dark inside, except for one electric bulb. 
</P>
<P>
The room had an eerie, unsettling quality. Despite the dim light it was easy to 
see the deeply carved rock walls and ceiling that had many of the same designs 
as the outside rocks. The structure had been built without the use of mortar or 
support beams; the rocks had been carefully fitted together. 
</P>
<P>
Newgrange faces toward the winter solstice that occurs Dec. 21. When the sun 
rises on that date its rays shine through a small opening above the entrance 
way and reach the stone floor in the center of the structure. 
</P>
<P>
To its builder, these 20 minutes or so of light inside Newgrange signified the 
start of winter. The other megalithic mounds face the sunrise (and in some 
cases, moonrise) at its various solstices. 
</P>
<P>
The people who built Newgrange remain a mystery. They obviously knew something 
about astronomy and science and must have had some understanding of 
mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the intricate stone inscriptions at these sites are maps of 
the sun, stars and planets. 
</P>
<P>
Many designs occur in a series of 31, possibly representing the charting of the 
sun or moon over a one-month period and forming an early stone calendar. 
</P>
<P>
At one time Ireland had more than 100 similar structures in Ireland. Many 
smaller mounds were destroyed by farmers clearing fields. 
</P>
<P>
Newgrange, however, was undisturbed for thousands of years and is the best 
preserved megalithic structure open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The national bus company of Ireland offers round-trip tours of the Boyne Valley 
from Dublin through Oct. 12, Sundays and Thursdays. These tours include 
Newgrange and Slane. 
</P>
<P>
The Hill of Tara, southwest of Newgrange in Navan, is the ancient seat of the 
high kings of Ireland and offers spectacular views. Today Navan, capital of 
County Meath, is known for greyhound racing and a newly discovered zinc mine, 
the largest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the area are ruins of many old monasteries and castles, as well as the 
largest concentration of megalithic structures. Archeological research is in 
progress at Knowth and Dowth, which are thought to be companion mounds to 
Newgrange and will likely be open to the public next year. 
</P>
<P>
On the return trip to Dublin the bus stops at Malahide Castle just north of 
Dublin Airport. The castle is the ancestral home of the Bowe family, which lost 
15 of its members in the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the Bowe family gave the castle to Ireland, and it was turned 
into the magnificent Irish National Portrait Gallery. Its oversize paintings of 
Ireland's nobility of the 16th through 19th centuries are well suited to the 
large halls of the castle, which is open daily. There is also a tearoom. 
</P>
<P>
The Boyne River is known for its trout and salmon fishing, and the area offers 
excellent hunting. There are some very good country-style hotels that have 
provided accommodations for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Headfort Arms Hotel in Kells, County Meath, is adjacent to Headfort House, 
once the home of Lord Headfort. For a double room, the per-person price is 
about $32.

YOUTH BEAT: AUSTRALIA OPENS THREE NEW LOW-COST HOSTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three key Australian cities -- Sydney, Melbourne and Cairns -- have new hostels 
for budget travelers. 
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, it's not just the youth hostel that's appealing. One of the city's 
charms is that it offers visitors the opportunity to take in city sights and 
enjoy the beach life as well. 
</P>
<P>
You can start your day in the central city area with a visit to the Australian 
Museum and a walking tour through the 200-year-old historic district known as 
"The Rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Then you can take a 10-minute ferry trip across the harbor to Manly Beach, or 
grab a bus to the popular surfing suburb of Bondi Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sydney's new flagship youth hostel, Hereford Lodge, has a pool, sauna, rooftop 
recreation area, TV and video lounge, plus a low-cost cafeteria. It's at 51 
Hereford St. in Glebe. 
</P>
<P>
The hostel has 92 rooms. The price per person in a twin room is about $14 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne Cup 
</P>
<P>
If you want to experience the exciting atmosphere of one of Australia's premier 
sports events, plan to be in the Melbourne area on the first Tuesday in 
November. The city comes to a halt as everyone focuses attention on Australia's 
most important horse race, the Melbourne Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne area is also one of the most popular spots to enjoy another 
Australian custom -- the BYO (bring your own) restaurants. These are 
establishments that allow you to furnish your own wine or beer to enjoy with 
your meal. The minimum drinking age in Australia is 18. 
</P>
<P>
Melbourne's new youth hostel is at 118 Lonsdale St. It can accommodate up to 
140 people, who are charged $13 each night. 
</P>
<P>
Cairns, on Australia's northeastern coast, draws travelers to investigate the 
Great Barrier Reef. The town has several hostels that compete for business from 
young visitors. In addition to accommodations, they offer opportunities for 
economical trips to the rain forest, plus river rafting and sailing adventures. 
</P>
<P>
The new Cairns youth hostel is at 20-24 McLeon St. just opposite the railway 
station. The single-room rate is $12 a night. A bed in a twin room costs $9, 
while a bed in a dormitory room is $7. 
</P>
<P>
All three youth hostels are members of a network of 130 Australian hostels 
affiliated with the International Youth Hostel Federation. If you are not a 
member of your own national youth hostel association, they may request that you 
buy a guest membership, or pay a few dollars extra per night. There are no age 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Australia also has many independent budget-priced hostels. They tend to supply 
information about each other, so once you start using them you can find out 
about others. 
</P>
<P>
The youth hostels offer young travelers a good place to exchange information 
and develop friendships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On-Site Vans 
</P>
<P>
When several people begin to travel together, the variety of opportunities 
expand. You can begin to consider new options such as buying a cheap car and 
making more use of campgrounds, where you'll discover another Australian 
novelty, the on-site van. 
</P>
<P>
These are recreational vehicles parked in permanent positions in campgrounds; 
you can rent them by the night or week. 
</P>
<P>
One free source of information about budget accommodations, including some 
youth hostels, budget hotels, tourist homes and campgrounds, is a publication 
called "Destination Australia." 
</P>
<P>
The guide also covers basic information on what to see and do in key tourism 
areas, and offers advice on a variety of services such as bus passes and tour 
operators. Copies are available from the Australian Tourist Commission, 2121 
Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1200, Los Angeles 90067, (213) 552-1988. 
</P>
<P>
If you need to make transportation arrangements after you arrive in Australia, 
keep in mind that STA Travel (formerly Student Travel Australia) has offices in 
Hobart, Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth, Townsville and Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
The company specializes in services for all young travelers. They also have a 
network of offices in other countries, including Indonesia, so they can help 
with arrangements and information when you want to move on from Australia.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: LUXURIOUS BOUTIQUES AT HAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Merin is a New York City free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands and its biggest city, but the 
country's political and diplomatic life is centered at The Hague. 
</P>
<P>
This charming and sophisticated city, about 40 miles southwest of Amsterdam, is 
the seat of Dutch government and the residence of Dutch royalty, as well as the 
site of foreign embassies and of the International Court of Justice (the 
world's Supreme Court, where attorneys and government representatives gather to 
resolve international disputes about business, borders and byways). 
</P>
<P>
As European nations move toward unity in 1992, The Hague is becoming an 
increasingly important destination for American business travelers. At the same 
time, it continues to attract tourists with its rich array of museums and 
historic attractions, and to delight shoppers with its elegant and refined 
boutiques filled with a wide range of high-quality goods that cater to 
sophisticated international clients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historic Setting 
</P>
<P>
The Hague's most appealing retailers are concentrated in a downtown shopping 
district, conveniently within several blocks of the Binnenhof. A must-see 
collection of beautiful palaces, courtyards, arches and portals that date back 
to the 13th Century, the Binnenhof is home to the Dutch Parliament and several 
ministries. 
</P>
<P>
The Hague's most elegant department store, De Bonneterie (Gravenstraat 2), is 
the shopping district's anchor. This is where the queen and other members of 
the royal family, as well as diplomats, select purchases from a tastefully 
assembled assortment of luxurious clothes and personal accessories made by 
Gucci, Guy Laroche, Georges Rech, Ralph Lauren, Valentino, Louis Feraud, 
Celine, Bruno Magli, Burberrys, Hugo Boss, Daks and other top manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are steep, but De Bonneterie offers superb personal service and has 
terrific snob appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby is the Passage. This is The Hague's covered shopping arcade, always 
beautifully decorated with fresh flowers. The Passage has about a dozen choice 
shops, several of which have been there since the arcade opened in 1895 or 
since it was expanded in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
There are boutiques with lovely leather goods and jewelry, and shops with 
electronic goods and cameras, but the Passage is best for shops selling a 
tempting variety of sweets for on-the-spot nibbling or wrapped gifts to take 
home. Leonidas (Passage 28) has a fine assortment of rich, hand-dipped 
chocolates, some filled with liqueur, for about $2 U.S. per 100 grams. 
</P>
<P>
Notenspecialist (Passage 35-37) specializes in all sorts of roasted nuts, sold 
for about $2.50 per 250 grams. The cashews are especially fresh and fabulous. 
In addition, the shop's 15 varieties of honey, including an exclusive French 
heather honey, are presented in pretty jars or pots and cost from $1.25 to $9. 
Also, there is Chinese ginger in lovely porcelain pots for $6.50 to $160, 
depending on the quantity and container. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetheart (Passage 24) is a candy chain store that sells bag-it-yourself 
gummies, chews and chocolates, wrapped in colored paper cones, for $1 per 100 
grams. 
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to Passage are Spui-straat, Venestraat, Hoogstraat and Noordeinde, 
shopping streets that have been The Hague's center of commerce since the Middle 
Ages. Most important is Hoogstraat (High Street), a pedestrian-only street 
lined on both sides by elegant shops and boutiques occupying the ground floors 
of picturesque houses that were built in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Hoogstraat's international label boutiques include Austin Reed (No. 16) and Max 
Mara (No. 41), among others, but most interesting are the superb local shops. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Lampe (No. 10) has chic and casual Dutch-made women's clothes of 
high quality and moderate price. Mix-and-match styles are designed in vibrant 
colors. There are pink raincoats ($130) with purple polka-dot linings and 
apple-green raincoats ($110) with lemon-yellow linings. 
</P>
<P>
Comfortable cotton knit skirts, in a variety of pastel colors and buttoned down 
the sides, cost $50 and may be worn with any of three attractive tops that 
range from $40 to $60. A three-piece navy blue wool-and-nylon knit suit costs 
about $200 and comes with skirt and slacks. 
</P>
<P>
There are heavy cotton blazers of mauve or lavender for $80, and pretty pastel 
shoes with trendy toes and heels for $45 to $75. T-shirts come in wild floral 
prints and cost $45. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dalen Schoenen (No. 12) has wonderful, moderately priced shoes, including 
open-toe suede pumps ($75) in a rainbow of colors and multi-colored sandals 
($75) of cutout suede or braided leather. Men's leather oxfords and loafers, in 
a variety of styles and colors, sell for $60 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
The Society Shop (No. 14), part of the Dutch chain of top-quality men's 
haberdashers, sells clothes with Burberrys, Windsor, Arrow and Van Laack 
labels, as well as its own very handsome T.S.S. line of two-piece pin-stripe 
suits (from $400 to $650), tweedy jackets ($300 to $500), trousers (about $140) 
and pure cotton shirts ($45 to $100). 
</P>
<P>
Add 25% to prices for custom-made shirts and suits, which can be delivered 
within two to three weeks. The shop also sells fine leather wallets, portfolios 
and briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
Parfumerie Douglas (No. 18) has a terrific selection of cosmetics and men's and 
women's fragrances at discounted prices. Trussardi Uomo Eau de Toilette (50 
milliliters in a handsome leatherlike flask) costs $30 and Davidoff's Cool 
Water After Shave (75 milliliters) is $23. 
</P>
<P>
Cacharel's Anais Anais Eau de Toilette Spray (15 milliliters) is $9 and 
Givenchy's Ysatis Eau de Toilette Spray (25 milliliters) is $19. Amusing gift 
items include boldly-striped sponge slippers for $4.50 and bath sponges shaped 
like strawberries, bananas and hard-cooked eggs (complete with yolks) for $4.50 
each. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Linen Comfort 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Strater's (No. 22) stock consists of superbly styled women's clothing 
made of linen and cotton. Although the palette concentrates on earth tones, 
including rich solid colors and subtle prints, there are blue-and-white-striped 
suits and double-breasted dresses ($150), as well as attention-getting 
red-and-olive tops ($85), skirts ($75) and vests ($50). 
</P>
<P>
Accessories, including a wide leather belt in chartreuse ($75), are brilliantly 
colored to allow for individual accenting. 
</P>
<P>
Jeweler Schaap (No. 23) has exclusive and expensive baubles, including colored 
gemstones surrounded by beautiful 18-carat gold settings for rings, pins and 
pendants, as well as turn-of-the-century antique silver jewelry and magnificent 
Persian Gulf pearls. Less costly antique items range from about $150 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Con en Verdonck (No. 30) has a magnificent collection of handmade carpets 
brought from Tibet, Morocco, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. Prices 
range from about $50 for small mats or carry bags made from rugs, to $25,000 
for superb room-size samples from Shiraz or Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
In den Silvern Molenbeecker (No. 31), founded during the 1860s, sells its own 
stunning patterns of expensive silverware and silver service, but most unusual 
are the antique molds (those that are worn out or are for discontinued 
patterns) that are sold as unusual home-decorating items. 
</P>
<P>
Focke &amp; Meltzer (No. 33) features tableware, tiles and vases by Holland's 
finest potteries, including De Porceleyne Fles blue-and-white Delftware and 
colorful Makkum patterns, as well as beautiful Baccarat and Saint Louis 
glassware. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are on the high side, but smaller items, such as Makkum tiles ($19) and 
De Porceleyne Fles souvenir plates ($85 and up), make lovely gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Hoogstraat runs into Noordeinde, with another collection of fine shops. Pauw 
(No. 42) features Dutch designer Madeleine Pauw's women's fashions with an 
appealing countryside style. 
</P>
<P>
There are floral print tops ($100) and calf-length skirts ($145), as well as 
linen bolero jackets ($345) and woolen ($420) or linen ($400) double-breasted 
blazers, plus a wide range of small ($14) to large ($100) floral print scarfs 
and shawls. A very attractive collection. 
</P>
<P>
Tesselschade-Arbeid Adelt (No. 92), a shop that profits philanthropic projects, 
sells charming Dutch-made handcrafts, including folk dolls ($20 and up) and 
toys ($16 and up), table mats ($5 each), tea cozies ($25) and hand-painted 
canisters (about $15). 
</P>
<P>
Noordeinde has a string of intriguing antique shops, including Damen (No. 95) 
for old pewter, Ten Boom en van Duffelen (No. 132) for antique clocks and 
barometers, Smelik en Stokking (No. 156) for more old pewter and S. van Leeuwen 
(No. 164) for ornate Dutch furniture and vintage Delftware. 
</P>
<P>
These shops have top-quality merchandise and tend to be quite expensive, but 
looking is free and browsers are welcome.

CONSUMER REPORT: CLAIMS SET AIRLINES AND STATES AT ODDS OVER ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state-versus-federal jurisdictional battle is shaping up over the question of 
airline advertising. 
</P>
<P>
In Waco, Tex., a U.S. judge has told 33 states, including California, to 
refrain -- for now -- from taking legal action against what the states perceive 
as misleading and improper ads by air carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Suits filed by the attorneys general of the respective states are pending 
against airlines in Texas, California, New York and Kansas. Others are in 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The suits are essentially identical, and are based on new guidelines issued 
recently by the National Assn. of Attorneys General. These guidelines are at 
the heart of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The states contend that their internal law enforcement agencies have the right 
to regulate matters, such as the content of advertisements, that affect their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines argue that all of their activities, including advertising, are 
regulated and controlled by the federal government through the Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
There is enough of an issue here, apparently, for U.S. District Judge Walter 
Smith to want to settle it once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
The NAAG guidelines, ratified by the 33 states, were aimed at preventing the 
airlines from making extravagant, eye-catching claims in their ads, and from 
presenting the product advertised in what the member states consider a 
misleading manner. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, how often have you been alerted by the huge letters in an airline 
ad offering "New York, $98 one way. . . .," or words to that effect, only to 
learn that you can't buy the ticket on a one-way basis? 
</P>
<P>
That fare, according to the attorneys general, is not $98 one way. It's $196 
round trip, and should be so advertised. 
</P>
<P>
Another airline practice that upsets the states' law enforcement officers is 
the air carriers' tendency to omit mandatory taxes and their own surcharges 
from advertised prices. 
</P>
<P>
The way the members of NAAG see it, if a $100 fare can only be bought by paying 
an $8 tax, be it local or state or federal, plus a $6 fuel surcharge, it should 
be advertised as a $114 fare. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge to that thinking was filed in Waco by TWA, Continental and 
British Airways. They argued that the Texas attorney general's office had no 
right to sue them on the grounds of their advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Smith first granted an injunction only against the state of Texas, preventing 
the attorney general there from taking action against the three carriers, 
pending review. Later, at the request of the carriers, he took the injunction a 
step further, extending it to the 33 states that subscribe to the NAAG 
guidelines and to all domestic airlines. 
</P>
<P>
And so the battle is joined. 
</P>
<P>
California's position, like that of the other states, is clear. Representatives 
of the attorney general's office do not question -- and never have questioned 
-- the legitimacy of the Department of Transportation, or some other federal 
body, as the regulator of many substantive aspects of airline industry 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said, "What we are talking about is advertising a product in 
California in a manner that could mislead the citizens. We're not talking about 
safety, or mergers, or anything like that. We are talking about protecting our 
citizens from reacting to advertising that too often tells less than the whole 
story." 
</P>
<P>
The airlines, on the other hand, fear a day when all 50 states might enact 
legislation affecting their advertising practices, which surely would make 
their job more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Air Transport Assn., whose members are the domestic 
airlines, stated the industry's position: 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be presented with a patchwork quilt of regulations of our 
advertising or, for that matter, any other aspect of our business," he said. 
"The federal government, through the Department of Transportation and the 
Federal Aviation Administration, oversees our activities. 
</P>
<P>
"And that is where the question of advertising should remain -- in federal 
jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
It will probably take months before the review gets started and months more 
before it is completed. In the meantime, attorneys general will almost 
certainly continue to prepare, but not file, misleading advertising suits 
against airlines.

AT HOME: CYPRESS: MIDWEST SPIRIT IN ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES ARE ATTRACTED TO THIS DOWN-HOME COMMUNITY WITH ITS FOLKSY 
NEIGHBORHOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
When the owner of Cypress' only golf course closed the links to make way for a 
167-acre commercial development, citizens rose up in protest and voted down the 
developer's plans in a recent citywide election. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises might not have known what it was getting into 
when it began its wrangle with the down-home Orange County community, described 
by one civic leader as a "spirited tiny town like you might find in the Midwest 
-- and we intend to stay that way." 
</P>
<P>
It's the type of town where children decorate their wagons on the Fourth of 
July and parade around their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
It's a town where longtime resident Joyce Nicholson can't go to the Albertson's 
supermarket without being stopped by a dozen other residents who want to talk 
not only about the price of produce but also the latest town gossip. 
</P>
<P>
"We grew up with Ozzie and Harriet. We wanted that when we grew up. And here we 
have it," said Cheryl Matuz, who moved to town two years ago with her husband, 
Ed, and their twin sons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
T-Ball and Soccer 
</P>
<P>
The Matuz boys are only in kindergarten, but already they're busy several days 
a week on T-ball and soccer teams. Ed Matuz is coach for the baseball team, and 
Cheryl is team mom in the baseball league, which is part of the town's 
extensive recreational system. 
</P>
<P>
So popular is the recreation program that residents from bordering cities often 
use the address of relatives in Cypress to try to get in. 
</P>
<P>
The folksy neighborhoods and ballparks that characterize Cypress were part of a 
master plan for a residential and business community in the 1950s, when cows 
were ordered out and the name Cypress replaced an area that had been known as 
Watertown and Dairy City. 
</P>
<P>
Near the western edge of Orange County, Cypress became a popular settling place 
for middle-income families who wanted bigger homes and yards than they could 
afford in Torrance or Long Beach, where they worked. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress was on its way to becoming a sleepy bedroom community when the Cypress 
Citizens' Assn. formed in the early 1970s to oppose a residential development 
proposed for an area earmarked as part of the city's business park. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to have mixed-use developments or we would simply be a bedroom 
community that would just founder with no tax base," said Nicholson, who led 
the successful fight. "We needed more businesses, but city officials said we 
were in a bad location to attract them." 
</P>
<P>
The business center has since become one of the most successful in Southern 
California and is now the American headquarters for Yamaha Motor, Mitsubishi 
Motor Sales of America and Panasonic Technics, among other Asian firms, and it 
is the corporate headquarters for PacifiCare Health Systems and McDonnell 
Douglas Automation Division. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the citizens' association was revived in the 1980s at the start of 
the Hollywood Park Realty controversy to fight against what the group 
considered too much commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
When Hollywood Park Realty wanted to transform the former public golf course 
surrounding Los Alamitos Race Course in Cypress into a business park and office 
complex, the association fought the development. And in February, voters 
soundly defeated the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The growing number of large companies, attracted to Cypress because of its 
proximity to freeways and to the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, greatly 
enhance the tax base and employ thousands of workers. But most of their workers 
come from other towns, and most Cypress residents drive to jobs outside the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Matuz commutes to Long Beach for a sales job with Douglas Aircraft. The 
Matuz family moved from Hacienda Heights in 1986 because houses were more 
affordable in Cypress than in nearby towns, and the neighborhoods were full of 
young families with children. 
</P>
<P>
"Neighbors watch each other's kids here," said Cheryl Matuz, who works part 
time as a dental hygienist in nearby Los Alamitos. "In Hacienda Heights, 
neighbors didn't know each other. I wouldn't have imagined letting anyone watch 
my kids." 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and Jerry Nicholson moved to Cypress in 1969 from a neighborhood in West 
Garden Grove, also because of their children. 
</P>
<P>
"Although Cypress was small, it had a college, which said something about the 
town and the type of people who wanted to live there," said Jerry Nicholson, 
who is a schoolteacher at North High School in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"On a practical level, if the kids didn't want to go to a university, Cypress 
College was an option," Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
While the town can be ideal for young, middle-class families, its neighborhoods 
also can be homogeneous, with very few homes displaying either poverty or great 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a middle market," said Joyce Nicholson, who also works as a real estate 
agent. "If you want to move up, you typically have had to to move out. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few New Homes 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said the most expensive homes sell for about $425,000. Most 
characteristic is the three-bedroom starter home, which Nicholson said sells 
for about $210,000, compared to a little less than $180,000 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson and her husband said that with their children now grown, they may 
soon be looking for a newly built home, also a rarity in Cypress, where most 
homes are now more than five years old. 
</P>
<P>
The former "Texaco tank farm," the site of crude oil tanks for years, is now 
being developed by Cypress Homes Inc., with 670 homes planned, the first 
expected to open in the fall of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Hollywood Park Realty land, the tank farm is the last area to be 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
To stay in their home as their tastes get more expensive, the Matuz family is 
now in the middle of a major remodeling that has meant ripping out carpets and 
sanding the hardwood underneath. 
</P>
<P>
A new family room has been added to the four-bedroom, two-fireplace home, and 
other additions include French doors and windows, a potbellied stove and a 
Colonial mantel. 
</P>
<P>
Although Joyce Nicholson characterizes the style of Cypress as Midwestern, it 
lacks some attractions of towns in the Heartland. There is no downtown, and 
there is not even a regional shopping mall, nor is either planned. 
</P>
<P>
And with the city's master plan nearly complete, the last major issue for the 
city's growth will be the settlement of the Hollywood Park property, which now 
has an uncertain future, said Darrell Essex, city manager of Cypress since 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
On Nicholson's wish list for part of the land is a civic theater complex, which 
might be home to the Cypress Civic Theatre group and a new pops orchestra that 
has recently formed. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, residents said it's likely that Jerry Nicholson and others 
will have to go to another town if they want to play golf.

CONDO Q &amp; A: MOTIVATING OWNERS TO BE ACTIVE IN ASSOCIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, Hickenbottom is president of the Greater Los Angeles 
chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: The Community Associations Institute, a national nonprofit 
research and educational organization, estimates that one of every eight 
homeowners lives in some form of community association or common-interest real 
estate development. 
</P>
<P>
 With the introduction this week of "Condo Q&amp;A," The Times offers 
reader-oriented advice on the operation, financing and maintenance of condos, 
homeowner associations, cooperatives and other forms of community associations. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: Most of the owners in our condominium complex do not want to 
participate in the operation of the association, and we have a tough time 
finding people who are willing to serve on the board of directors. At a recent 
annual meeting, we didn't have a quorum present, so the meeting had to be 
postponed. What can we do? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Let's start by analyzing some of the reasons for apathy. First, most 
people have heavy work schedules, so they are very protective of their leisure 
time. Second, most people move into a condominium thinking that they don't need 
to participate in the management or decision-making of the association. In 
fact, some people don't really understand what they've purchased at all. 
</P>
<P>
Third, as long as the association is running smoothly, most people will not be 
motivated to participate. It's a fact that if the board starts making unpopular 
decisions, more people will be inclined to speak up and act. Fourth, perhaps 
your current board is stifling interest by discouraging owner input or having 
"secret" meetings (always a mistake). 
</P>
<P>
In this situation, those who might be interested simply give up in frustration 
or disgust. Sometimes the board members enjoy their power or martyrdom and 
continually exclaim to all how demanding and unfulfilling it is to serve on the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some suggestions that may encourage owner involvement: 
</P>
<P>
1. The board should communicate with owners using a brief newsletter to inform 
owners of board meeting dates, board action, current issues and concerns facing 
the association. Invite owners to participate. Ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
2. Set up committees, such as budget and finance, landscape, building 
maintenance, social, etc., to give input to the board. Committee members will 
often become future board members. 
</P>
<P>
3. Several weeks before the next annual meeting and board election, schedule a 
social event, a Neighborhood Watch meeting or a program with interesting 
speakers that will draw the owners. During the event, promote the approaching 
annual meeting, encourage owners to nominate potential board members and urge 
attendance at the meeting or sending a proxy if attendance isn't possible. 
Remind them of the added expense and effort that results from failing to get a 
quorum. Be creative; maybe offer a door prize. 
</P>
<P>
4. After all that, you may still have to go door-to-door to collect proxies so 
that the annual meeting can be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Association Has Much Lower Dues 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do we know whether our association's budget is accurate and realistic? A 
similar association in our area has a much lower budget and its owners pay $50 
a month less than we pay. 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't assume that your board is a bunch of spendthrifts. Even though the 
other association seems similar, there may be many reasons that your 
association's expenses are greater, such as type of amenities, size of staff, 
type of management, amount of landscaping and, here's the big one, the amount 
of reserve funds that are being set aside for major repair and replacement, or 
capital expense. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, a great deal of time and effort goes into the budgeting process, so 
don't start criticizing until you have gained some solid information. Talk with 
your association president, treasurer or management company representative. 
Don't be surprised if you are asked to serve on the next budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Dog Owners Let Their Pets Roam 
</P>
<P>
Q: A few owners in our association allow their dogs to run loose occasionally. 
I don't dislike dogs, but I dislike owners who allow their dogs to roam. We 
have an association rule about controlling pets but the board seems unable to 
enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
A: This is probably an instance where the association's rule is duplicated by 
city or county code. Contact your local authorities to seek help if the dogs 
are a nuisance or a safety hazard. Then, work with your board to put some teeth 
into your rule enforcement. If your Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions 
(CC&amp;Rs) allow you to impose fines on rule violators, that may be an 
effective enforcement tool. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Thinks Heating Pool Is Unnecessary 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our board thinks that our gas bills for heating the swimming pool are an 
unnecessary expense. Can they just arbitrarily decide to stop heating the pool? 
One of our members has threatened to sue the board if they do this. 
</P>
<P>
A: First, board members should make sure that they have adequately researched 
the gas expense records. Then, check the capacity and efficiency of the pool 
heater. An inadequate size or inefficient heater can greatly increase gas 
usage. You may need a new heater. 
</P>
<P>
Find out how much you could save by simply lowering the temperature setting or 
limiting the amount of time or the months of the year that the pool is heated. 
Look at alternate methods of heating, such as solar heating systems or solar 
blankets. Analyze the pay-back of the cost of converting to solar heat. 
</P>
<P>
Communication with the owners is necessary. Survey the owners and residents to 
find out about the number of people that use the pool and the peak periods of 
use and explain the current costs and the alternate solutions which are being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
You may find that a majority of the members want the pool heated regardless of 
the cost. All of these factors should contribute to the board's decision. The 
board might want to put this matter to a vote of the members. 
</P>
<P>
Bear in mind that the decision may result in some resentment and, in the 
extreme, even a lawsuit. The board should carefully document the contributing 
factors to show that they used good business judgment, and, most important, 
they should communicate openly and honestly with the owners throughout the 
decision-making process.

SPEAKING OUT: KING OF CASTLE FRETS ROYALLY OVER REMODELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART SANDFORD, Sandford teaches Spanish at Fillmore High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many grim stories have been written by homeowners about remodeling jobs that 
left them and their property permanently scarred. Although I have yet to remove 
a single door from its hinge or be stood up by a contractor, the remodeling 
nightmare has already begun for me. 
</P>
<P>
After my wife and I sold our condominium at Vista Del Freeway and purchased our 
little piece of the American Dream here in Fillmore in Ventura County, we 
realized that in order to accommodate our growing family, our house would need 
some work and maybe even some expansion beyond the 2 1/2 bedrooms and one bath 
currently squeezed into 1,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
A man is still king of his castle, until it comes to remodeling. That's when he 
loses control of his domain. That's when the queen, the town council and the 
artisans take over. The pride that I felt upon moving into our own separate, 
unique house is rapidly giving way to fear of watching it turned into a bad 
spoof of the "Money Pit." 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling is like a wedding: The plans go from simple and intimate to 
extravagant and financially ruinous. What we most desired (and still do) was a 
shower. (The water kind, not the wedding kind.) A bath in the morning is just 
not the same as a good, hot, water-wasting shower -- the ultimate in decadence. 
That was the idea behind our remodeling, installing a shower. 
</P>
<P>
That was before my wife got to looking at House Beautiful and similar 
publications and began talking to friends who had done such wonderful things to 
their houses. From a simple shower, the tentative plans now include a 
second-story addition, stuccoing, new windows, central heating and air 
conditioning, a fireplace, an additional bathroom, expanded kitchen, skylights 
and a helicopter landing pad (just kidding). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bureaucracy in Action 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I have had more than our share of disagreements about the ultimate 
outcome. We're getting to the point where we'll just say: "Have your architect 
call my architect." 
</P>
<P>
Small-town bureaucracy, or port-a-trailer government, also presents an 
obstacle. My mother-in-law has tried for the better part of the 20th Century to 
obtain a building permit to remodel her front porch here in Fillmore, but has 
had only limited success. 
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking official had asked her to wait until the City Council passed 
some sort of Front Porch Remodeling and Cat Neutering Act before submitting the 
application for the permit. When the law was passed and the application 
submitted, the city government apparatus tiptoed into action. 
</P>
<P>
The previous building inspector had rejected the plans once. It was resubmitted 
exactly as it had been submitted the first time, and the new inspector approved 
it. It was then left for the planning director to approve. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to speed up the process a little, my wife hand-delivered her mother's 
application to the planning director, bypassing the city clerk. This was a 
no-no. The planning director refused to sign the application until she could 
speak with the building inspector, who would not be available for several days 
as he was apparently attending a building inspectors' convention and Spam 
potluck. The saga continues. . . . 
</P>
<P>
To put it mildly, the city government does not appear to be very 
remodeler-friendly. This is rather unfortunate in a city whose housing stock as 
a whole is substandard and rapidly deteriorating. (In all fairness, I must note 
that the city is beginning a low-interest redevelopment program for substandard 
houses; we may even qualify, unless this article finds its way to the Planning 
Commission.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite my mother-in-law's discouraging experience with her porch, my spirits 
remain high. As a teacher, I look forward to the annual summer ritual of 
restarting those projects that were left by the wayside last September. 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling is at the top of my priority list and so I am going at it full tilt. 
But rather than bashing in walls, I am reading books such as "The Joy of 
Carpentry," "An Idiot's Guide to Do-It-Yourself Plumbing" and "You and Your 
Stucco." I also catch "This Old House" on PBS whenever possible and marvel at 
the glibness with which the host turns hopeless shanties into glittering 
mansions within 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the foreign land of building and remodeling threatens the little 
sovereignty that I currently possess over my home. I am bilingual, but I don't 
speak Construction. To me, a framer is someone who had something to do with the 
writing of the Constitution. A truss is something that I would never want to 
wear. And rafters is where I sit at a hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communications Test 
</P>
<P>
Communicating with the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, architects and 
masons who will soon rearrange the face and body of my humble home will be a 
real test of my endurance and sense of humor. I have been making some cultural 
adaptations that might aid in the breaking of the language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
I have begun to wear more flannel shirts and baseball caps and may even 
purchase a pickup truck. I will try to keep my cool and not be intimidated when 
they say things like: "Well, Mr. Sandford, I'm afraid your butt joints are 
severely warped and should be replaced with some CDX stud in order to support 
the soffits and maintain proper chinking. 
</P>
<P>
"You know it's a miracle that this shack is still standing. The job will cost 
10 times the original estimate. I can probably start working on it in February, 
or sometime during the Bush Administration." 
</P>
<P>
When this happens, I will try not to act like a lot of men and say "Uh-huh, I 
see. Yes, that's what I was going to suggest you do." 
</P>
<P>
The future of my home and my wallet (not to mention marital bliss) hang in the 
balance. As the actual time for the plans, permits and construction begins, I 
feel as if I am suffering from Pre-Remodeling Syndrome, an awful feeling that 
what is about to happen will be out of my control. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, it's all in our heads, psychosomatic remodeling. That's frightening 
and consoling at the same time. But the ball is rolling; I can only hope that 
it doesn't turn out to be a wrecking ball.

HOME PRICES UP NEARLY 27% IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Existing home prices in the seven-county Southland area rose 27.6% from April, 
1988, to April, 1989, reaching an average of $248,700, according to Michael 
Carney of the Real Estate Research Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The council's semi-annual home price survey is the fifth in a row showing 
escalating double-digit home-price inflation in Southern California, he said. 
The largest annual percentage increases were recorded in Los Angeles County -- 
up 31% to an average $312,400 -- and Ventura County -- up 29.2% to an average 
$232,300, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Based on 214 Houses 
</P>
<P>
Based at Cal Poly Pomona, the council conducts unsold housing inventory and 
home price surveys every quarter for Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, 
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. The market prices are 
based on appraisals of 214 sample houses in the seven counties. 
</P>
<P>
The home price index for the seven counties reached 523 in April, indicating 
that home prices in the sample have, on average, increased 5.23 times over 
their 1975 prices. The highest index for a specific home was 1,163, for one of 
the Beverly Hills houses in the sample. The April appraised value of $2.5 
million was 11.63 times its value in 1975, $215,000, Carney said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greatest Appreciation 
</P>
<P>
The indexes range from 357 in Riverside County to 635 in Ventura County, Carney 
said. The Ventura County index and the Los Angeles County index (630) indicate 
that those counties have had the greatest housing appreciation since 1975, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The Inland Empire counties of Riverside and San Bernardino had the lowest 
housing appreciation, respectively, 3.57 times and 3.75 times their 1975 
values, he said. San Diego County's index stood at 404; Orange County's was 490 
and Santa Barbara County's was 499. DAVID M. KINCHEN

STATE HOUSING CHIEF TAKES POST WITH BUILDERS GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christine Diemer Reed, California's top government housing official, will take 
over as executive director of an Orange County builders trade group on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, 36, will succeed John Erskine as head of the Orange County region of the 
Building Industry Assn. of Southern California. Erskine announced earlier this 
year that he was joining a local law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Reed was appointed head of the state Department of Housing and Community 
Development by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1986. She had previously served as a 
deputy attorney general and as deputy secretary for housing in the California 
business, transportation and housing agency. 
</P>
<P>
Reed is married to Dana Reed, a partner in the prominent Costa Mesa-based law 
firm of Reed &amp; Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 builders, developers and other businesses belong to the BIA's 
Orange County region, according to an official with the trade group. It has 
played a key role in shaping the course of development in several Southland 
areas, but perhaps is best known for being a linchpin in the business 
community's successful efforts to beat back the slow-growth Measure A on last 
year's Orange County ballots.

HOW TO SELECT INSPECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A good place to begin your search for a home inspector is the telephone Yellow 
Pages, under "Building Inspection Services," "Inspection Bureaus" or similar 
listings. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers, who commission the majority of inspections, are another 
good source. Ask a neighborhood broker for the names of three or four 
inspectors and check out their qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
The California Real Estate Inspection Assn., (916) 443-1422, will provide names 
of CREIA members in your area. If you live outside California, the American 
Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI), (202) 842-3096, will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some pointers for choosing a home inspector, along with suggestions on 
how to interpret and use the inspection report: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask if the inspector is a CREIA or ASHI member or a candidate -- a person 
in the process of becoming a full member -- of either organization. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check how long the inspector has been in business as a home inspector. Ask 
what special qualifications he or she has. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask if the inspector is experienced in residential construction, through 
education and experience, and is a licensed contractor. Most experts believe 
that a licensed contractor makes the best inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask to see sample inspection reports. Some inspectors use a checklist, 
while others supplement the checklist with a narrative report. The latter is 
easier to interpret, but it is important to have the checklist, too. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Once you have chosen the inspector, you must make arrangements with the 
seller or the seller's agent to conduct the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 -- According to Robert J. Bruss, a syndicated real estate 
columnist/lawyer/real estate broker, make sure that your offer to purchase 
includes a clause specifying a professional inspection, with the seller to pay 
for certain repairs. The seller will probably add a clause limiting the dollar 
amount of the repairs, Bruss advises. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Depending on the location of the house -- soil conditions, hillside site, 
etc. -- you may decide to have a professional engineer or a geologist inspect 
the property. In many cases, your home inspector can tell you if additional 
inspections are required. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When you get the completed report, don't panic if the inspector lists many 
minor items that need fixing: This is to be expected in just about any house -- 
existing or new. DAVID M. KINCHEN

Household formation is taking place at a more rapid pace than population 
growth. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, households increased by 
13.9% between 1980 and 1988 while population grew by 8.5%.

DYMALLY SAYS HE WILL SEEK PEACE WITH COMPTON COUNCIL

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that two city councilmen have been ousted by candidates backed by Rep. 
Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), the congressman says he plans to appeal to the 
council to end the bad blood that has made him persona non grata in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"The first Tuesday that I have open," Dymally said, "I will either fly in there 
or stay over (after a weekend in the district) and go publicly to the council 
and ask for a reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the strained relations between the council and the 
congressman, two council members last fall voted against his request to use the 
council chambers for a congressional hearing on gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert L. Adams and former Councilman Floyd A. James opposed the 
proposed hearing site even though the week before a Republican legislator used 
the chambers for the same purpose, Dymally said. 
</P>
<P>
But James was defeated in the April primary by Patricia Moore, who once worked 
for Dymally and received his support in the campaign. Adams was defeated in 
last week's runoff election by Compton school trustee Bernice Woods, who was 
also backed by Dymally. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said she was delighted to hear that her former boss plans to come before 
the council and she predicted he will be welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Must Work Together' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new day in Compton," Moore said. "James and Adams are no longer here 
and we have a council that recognizes that we must work together. . . . The 
city has such problems, it deserves the best representation." James and Adams 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Moore has been appointed to replace James, who resigned before his term expired 
to wage a write-in campaign against Adams and Woods in the runoff election. 
Woods will take her place on the council July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally's peace overture is aimed, he admits, at Mayor Walter R. Tucker. The 
congressman and Tucker have also been at odds for years. In last week's 
election, Dymally supported Tucker's unsuccessful opponent, Chuck (E .Boyd) 
Esters Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally said he supported Esters because the mayoral candidate's father, a 
prominent Compton clergyman, is a "dear, dear friend of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said she believes that the mayor will accept Dymally's offer to settle 
their differences. "I think Tucker is glad to be back in office and he wants to 
work with everybody," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman says he cannot pinpoint a specific reason or a starting point 
for the hostilities between him and some local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contributed to Ill Will 
</P>
<P>
But there is no doubt that his support of challengers to the mayor and two 
other councilmen in the last four years contributed to the ill will. Four years 
ago, he also supported Moore and another City Council candidate when they 
unsuccessfully challenged James and Adams. 
</P>
<P>
However, when James was later indicted for election fraud, Dymally said, he 
offered to testify on James' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally's activism on behalf of local candidates has been branded as bossism by 
local politicians. Tucker's campaign literature, for example, charged that 
Esters was a "puppet" of Dymally and "bought and paid for by him." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his Washington office, Dymally said he wants to 
work with Compton to solve some of its problems and help bring more resources 
to the city, particularly in the area of job opportunities for young people. 
</P>
<P>
"Compton is the only city that does not use my services in Congress," Dymally 
said. "I am the only member of Congress who has ever had an office there. . . . 
I bought a condo there. Hawthorne and Gardena want me," he said.

ARTFUL LESSONS FOR CAMBODIAN KINDERGARTNERS

Francie Hansen's philosophy of education is summed up in an ancient Chinese 
proverb printed in an old newspaper article that she keeps pasted in a 
notebook. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me, I forget," the proverb goes. "Show me, I remember. Involve me, I 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
It's a philosophy she implements by using art to teach English to her Cambodian 
kindergartners. 
</P>
<P>
Bright-eyed and scrubbed, they begin arriving for school well before the 8 a.m. 
starting time. Chatting loudly in their native language, they spread out across 
the floor, bending over papers and paintbrushes to complete the task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Involvement in Project 
</P>
<P>
The teacher's method is simple. Using largely discarded materials, she involves 
the children in an art project, which forms the basis for a discussion in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
"Art is the perfect vehicle," Hansen said. "It's the universal language." 
</P>
<P>
So far the approach seems to be working. The test scores of her students at 
Robert E. Lee Elementary School have improved, she said. The approach has 
attracted the attention of community members and colleagues. And it has 
resulted in several public displays of the students' artwork, including a 
monthlong exhibition at a city park. 
</P>
<P>
"She's doing well," said Lee Principal Bob Robertson. "We are very proud of 
her." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encourages Participation 
</P>
<P>
Dick Van der Laan, a spokesman for the Long Beach Unified School District, 
said: "Art is communication. It makes the children participants rather than 
passive spectators." 
</P>
<P>
They weren't always participating. Last July, when Hansen began teaching the 29 
5-year-olds, most of whom are the children of Cambodian refugees, very few 
could speak any English. Located in the city's large Cambodian neighborhood, 
Lee Elementary -- which is on a year-round schedule -- has a 41% Cambodian 
enrollment. "The room was silent," Hansen recalled. "They weren't ready to 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
It was only with the help of a Cambodian-speaking aide, the teacher said, that 
communication occurred at all. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen decided to try a different approach. A teacher with 18 years of 
experience and an artist, she began focusing more on art. First she led the 
children in directed drawings, exercises in which the class drew what the 
teacher described with the help of her bilingual aide. Then she gradually began 
shifting to projects requiring more individual initiative. By relying on what 
she perceived as the children's natural love of art to produce an atmosphere in 
which inhibitions were low and involvement high, she said, she created an 
environment highly conducive to learning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Each Answers Questions 
</P>
<P>
The scene on a recent day was typical. By 8 a.m. the children were sprawled on 
the floor, enthusiastically painting the indentations of cardboard fruit 
cartons in yellow, pink, white and blue. As they finished, they formed a line 
before Hansen, who asked a series of questions of each student. "How many 
blues?" she asked, referring to the number of indentations the child had 
painted blue. There followed interrogatories on each of the other colors, after 
which the teacher recorded the results on a toll sheet. The effect was a lesson 
in English colors and numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Later they tried another exercise. Using empty cylindrical tennis ball cartons, 
construction paper, scissors and glue, the children were instructed to create 
fanciful animals of their own choosing. Lining up again, they were each asked 
to describe something special about their animal; the teacher then inscribed 
the answers on on the animals' sides. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a girl bunny sticking her tongue out," said Mary Nasovann, 6, smiling 
shyly but clearly proud of her creation. 
</P>
<P>
"The lion wants to jump through a hoop of fire," said Sangkham Nou, 5, a 
sturdy, sober-looking boy with wide shoulders and piercing black eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen believes that such exercises help the children expand their English 
vocabularies. To enhance the process and add to their general educations, she 
also employs such traditional kindergarten techniques as reading stories to the 
children and involving them in elementary scientific experiments. But the art 
exercises have had a particularly dramatic effect, Hansen said, resulting in 
some obvious changes in the students' demeanor which she hopes will help them 
throughout their schooling. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so much more outgoing," she said. "They speak and they understand and 
I can really give them direction. They're interested in learning." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shops Display Work 
</P>
<P>
The changes have not gone unnoticed. During walking field trips to nearby 
business establishments, Hansen said, the children have charmed proprietors 
into displaying class artwork in such facilities as a yogurt shop, taco stand 
and flower shop. 
</P>
<P>
A recent monthlong exhibit at the El Dorado Nature Center, its organizer said, 
was seen by more than 12,000 people. "Besides being full of joy and 
creativity," said Mary Blackburn, the center's program director, "the work was 
pretty sophisticated for 5-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
Consisting of about 100 pieces, she said, the show included collages, drawings 
and three-dimensional paper sculptures of animals such as monsters, lions and 
snakes. "It was so full of color and animation that people thought it was just 
wonderful," Blackburn said. "It says that (the children) feel good about 
themselves and their place in the world. It says they feel confident."

PALM TREES WIN REPRIEVE FROM COUNCIL 
</P>

HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has decided to reconsider its plan to uproot and sell nearly 
200 palm trees scattered along residential streets after residents argued that 
the trees make the city more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen residents appeared before the City Council last Monday to urge that the 
trees be kept. Council members decided to hold a special meeting at 3 p.m. 
Monday to discuss the issue again. 
</P>
<P>
The council had voted in April to remove the stately old Canary Island Palms, 
which had reached heights of up to 60 feet. A staff report had warned that the 
trees will pose a greater liability threat, require increased maintenance, and 
may eventually be infested by rats. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of car owners filed claims after their vehicles were hit by falling 
branches, City Clerk Marilyn Boyette said. Officials also expressed concern 
that tree roots would crack sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
City officials planned to have the trees removed last week. A contractor agreed 
to pay the city $206 per tree to transplant the palms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worst Fears Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
But resident Jerald Russell noticed a bright orange florescent ring around a 
palm tree in front of his home, and a sign making the area off limits to 
parking for three days. He went to City Hall, where officials confirmed "the 
worst of my fears," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Six hours before the council met, Russell began his campaign to save the palms. 
He prepared folders containing photographs of city streets lined by palm trees 
for the council. He went door to door, passing out flyers and urging neighbors 
to attend the council meeting. A dozen residents showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the City Council knew what an asset it has with these fine 
trees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntington Park is doing a lot of redevelopment. Generally speaking, huge palm 
trees is what buyers expect to see. It would be in everybody's best interest to 
leave these trees in place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Roberts predicted that the council will back away from its plan 
to replace the palms with a variety of trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an opportunity, we felt, for the council to remove the problem, but if 
the people want to live with the problem, well, then we will do what the people 
want," he said.

THE HOMELESS: HOW ONE CITY COPES; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA FINDS TRANSIENTS ARE HERE TO STAY; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS' COMPLAINTS HAVE GROWN, BUT SO HAVE OFFERS OF FOOD, OTHER SERVICES

The scene outside the fancy restaurant at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard 
and Ocean Avenue was surreal. 
</P>
<P>
As well-heeled restaurant patrons deposited their cars with busy valet parking 
attendants on a recent Friday evening, a man in a business suit wrestled a 
homeless man to the ground. Quickly and efficiently, the suited man twisted his 
target into a military-style restraining hold, pinning him to the ground with 
the weight of his body. 
</P>
<P>
He waited for the police. 
</P>
<P>
The suited man turned out to be the manager of Ocean Ave Seafood, one of the 
many trendy restaurants along cliff-side, sea-view Ocean Avenue in downtown 
Santa Monica. Arich Berghammer said the disheveled transient had been pestering 
customers, refused to leave when asked and then "started swinging" when 
Berghammer insisted he move on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enough Is Enough' 
</P>
<P>
"After dealing with transients in Santa Monica, you know how to do this," 
Berghammer said of the way he had subdued the homeless man. Usually, he said, 
the numerous homeless who loiter near the restaurant and across the street in 
Palisades Park do not cause problems; but once in awhile, and more so in recent 
months, Berghammer says he has found it necessary to be forceful. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to be compassionate, but enough is enough," said Berghammer, who 
ultimately did not file criminal charges against the man. 
</P>
<P>
The incident underscores a predicament facing Santa Monica: A liberal city, 
where the official policy toward the homeless has been one of tolerance and 
leniency, now finds itself in danger of being overwhelmed by a growing, 
increasingly desperate and -- some say -- more aggressive transient population. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that by being lenient, Santa Monica has become a magnet for the 
homeless; some of the homeless themselves concur. But several city officials 
and advocates for the homeless disagree, saying Santa Monica is merely 
suffering part of a greater, national problem and has a duty to be 
compassionate. 
</P>
<P>
When a social worker was stabbed to death, allegedly by a mentally ill homeless 
man, in Santa Monica last February, it was only the most dramatic incident in 
what law enforcement officials say is a disturbing trend that finds the 
homeless more frequently involved in crime, either as victim or culprit. 
</P>
<P>
In December of last year, two homeless men were killed, their bodies found in 
the park where they slept. A third transient was accused of the slayings. Days 
later, a transient involved in another attack on a homeless person was held on 
attempted murder charges. In March, the body of a murdered transient woman was 
found in the bushes along the Santa Monica bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Worker Slain 
</P>
<P>
And less than two months after social worker Robbyn Panich was slain, another 
counselor was allegedly stabbed by a drifter. She survived. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Police Department offers a breakdown: In 1985, there were nine 
homicides in the city, including one transient victim; there were no transient 
suspects. In 1988, victims in seven of the city's 10 homicides were transients; 
eight transients were arrested as suspects. 
</P>
<P>
While homeless are still more often the victim than the perpetrator of violent 
crimes, the reverberations nevertheless are many. Social workers throughout the 
Westside are attending special self-defense training sessions. Fights among 
transients have broken out on feeding lines. Waitresses at some downtown 
restaurants insist on being escorted home or to their cars when they leave at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Social service workers say it is no wonder tensions are running high among the 
homeless. The longer people are forced to live in the streets, they say, the 
more angry they become. The social workers blame cutbacks in mental health and 
emergency medical care, greater availability of cheap drugs, less money for 
rehabilitation, a growing disparity between rich and poor that is especially 
pronounced on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure Shows 
</P>
<P>
"People deteriorate; it's not like you can leave folks on the street for five 
years and it not have an extreme impact on them," said Vivian Rothstein, 
executive director of the Ocean Park Community Center, which sees hundreds of 
Santa Monica homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"The accumulated pressure on them is really showing. They are much more 
disturbed and angry than they were before," she said. "They are immensely, 
massively disabled." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such levels of desperation, many Santa Monica residents in the private 
and public sectors are scrambling for ways to deal with the homeless: A city 
attorney hands out sandwiches every Saturday on the front lawn of City Hall; 
businessmen pay the homeless to clean up a park; a one-of-a-kind shelter for 
mentally ill homeless women opens; a councilman enlists the help of developers 
to bring trailers to the city for use as temporary housing. 
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, Santa Monica spends $1.5 million a year on homeless 
programs. This is a story of how one city copes. 
</P>
<P>
The drop-in office run by the Ocean Park Community Center accepts homeless 
people for 90 minutes each morning, but on a recent day it was past deadline 
and people were still arriving in quest of free food, clothing and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Tactfully and gently, staff worker Richard Cassidy turned them away, telling 
them they were too late for that day and offering them a list of other agencies 
that might be able to help. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say no, but we really have to," Cassidy said, adding that if the 
center accepted people as they streamed in all day, the staff would be 
overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
The drop-in center has seen the number of people seeking help double in just 
the last six months, up to 180 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the increase is because the center moved from Ocean Park to a larger 
facility near downtown Santa Monica, but it also reflects growth in the area's 
homeless population, center directors say. Last year alone, the center saw 
5,000 different people. Officials believe the total will be higher this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Increasing 
</P>
<P>
"We are starting to see a lot more families, single parents with kids, or both 
parents and kids, more substance abusers, more veterans. In the sub-groups of 
homeless across the board, the numbers are increasing," said Terence Hill, who 
runs the center. 
</P>
<P>
At the center, housed in a converted surgical-instruments factory the city is 
providing rent-free, dozens of people mulled about or sat on benches, taking 
numbers to await used clothing or free groceries. Some stared vacantly, looking 
down and out, while others were talkative and energetic. Two women wore 
meticulously applied makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Cans of pork and sweet potatoes, boxes of macaroni and cheese, and jars of baby 
formula line shelves on one wall. Some food is donated, the rest purchased. One 
volunteer obtains leftover food from on-location movie shoots. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that after the stabbings, several of his volunteers threatened to 
quit out of fear. In response, homeless advocates enlisted the help of the 
Chamber of Commerce, which last month sponsored a six-hour training session on 
how to defuse potentially violent situations. Sixty people attended. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hill said, staff members will meet with police later this month to 
discuss security, and the professional counselors make it a point to be present 
in greater numbers when volunteers are working. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fear is subsiding now, but we are not taking it for granted," he 
said. "All it takes is one person acting out in a crowd of 150 to make it look 
like the homeless have gone mad" when the problems are isolated incidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shelter for Women 
</P>
<P>
Next door to the drop-in center is a new shelter for mentally ill homeless 
women, called Daybreak. Intended as a model program, the shelter opened in 
February with federal grants and is one of only two in the state, according to 
Executive Director Rothstein. 
</P>
<P>
Daybreak attempts to reach out to a particularly difficult population. Women 
often become more isolated on the streets than men do, social workers say, 
because of fear and the need to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We're serving a population that many people feel can't be served or doesn't 
want to be served," Rothstein said. "We are showing that is not the case, that 
treated with respect, they will come off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
The shelter, its high walls painted in shades of salmon and blue and decorated 
with colorful tapestries and drawings, has a small kitchen and individual 
curtained cubicles with beds for 15 women. It is designed to create a home-like 
environment so that the women, who will remain for six months, can re-learn 
basic skills, such as how to sleep at night instead of during the day, how to 
cook and maintain personal hygiene, how to take medicine, and what counselors 
call "anger management." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Re-Enter Society 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the women become reconnected to society, eventually attain some level 
of independence and can live in some form of permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the women have not lived indoors for five years, Rothstein and Daybreak 
Manager Beth Wagner said. Rothstein and Wagner say they have encountered 
terrifying medical problems, even a case of cancer, that have gone untreated 
for years. A couple of women were pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Daybreak coordinators found themselves confronted with problems that 
a small, community-based nonprofit organization such as theirs is ill-equipped 
to handle. After all, it is an emergency shelter, not a medical facility, 
Rothstein points out. 
</P>
<P>
"So where does a homeless woman who is mentally ill and has no money go to 
deliver a baby?" she asks. "These are problems no other sector of society is 
handling. (But) we can only handle a piece of the problem. . . . We can't do it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday mornings, the city attorney of Santa Monica, Robert M. Myers, and 
members of his staff gather early on an upper floor of City Hall. There, among 
the filing cabinets, legal briefs and computers, they put together scores of 
sandwiches and then dole them out to long lines of homeless people who file 
past the City Hall front steps onto the manicured lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Myers and company have been doing this for a year and a half. On peak days last 
year, Myers estimates that he had about 100 customers; this year it easily 
reaches 150. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney sees his efforts as part of a socially conscience duty to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
But Myers has come under fire for what some see as excessive leniency where the 
homeless are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some crimes I simply won't prosecute," he said, giving as examples 
public drunkenness and sleeping in a public park. Other violations are examined 
on a case-by-case basis, but, in general, Myers maintains that the criminal 
justice system, with its revolving-door jail cells and lack of social services 
and counseling, fails the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jail Program 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he and the Ocean Park Community Center have set up a "jail outreach 
program." Every morning, a counselor meets with Myers or his assistants to 
discuss cases and determine whether the homeless people detained on a 
particular day can be incorporated into an agency's social service program. 
</P>
<P>
"We've told the homeless they are not part of society," Myers said. "Thus it is 
unrealistic to expect them to obey all the rules of society." 
</P>
<P>
The position is not popular with everyone. Police officials, claiming their 
hands are often tied when it comes to cracking down on law-breaking transients, 
have openly criticized the city attorney's reluctance to prosecute. And many 
critics blame this leniency for attracting the scores of homeless who now roam 
Santa Monica's streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tolerance definitely extends an invitation (to the homeless) to come 
here," said City Councilwoman Christine Reed. "It has a higher impact than 
Martin Sheen inviting them to Malibu." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said she receives numerous complaints about vagrants, especially from 
senior citizens and women who feel threatened or intimidated by aggressive 
panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, they feel they can no longer lead the life they led in Santa 
Monica four years ago," Reed said. "They don't feel they can comfortably go 
downtown or wait at a bus stop. It's an emotional ordeal, especially for older 
women, and I find it heartbreaking."

Terry McKnight, 50, figures he's been homeless on the Westside "off and on" for 
17 years. He has become something of an advocate for the homeless, advising his 
comrades on where to get the help they need and how to survive on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people to find hide-outs around trees . . . out in the bluffs," 
McKnight said. "That's the only way to do it. Otherwise, they're subject to 
being beaten, stabbed or getting robbed." 
</P>
<P>
Sporting a bicyclist's helmet, McKnight has become a regular fixture at the 
evening feedings in Palisades Park, the stretch of grass and palm trees 
overlooking the ocean that is home to scores of homeless. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, every afternoon, six days a week, the park has been 
the scene of a feeding program sponsored by a group of Westside homemakers, 
artists, show business folk and others. They load a picnic table with food for 
transients who line up by the dozens. Much of the food is donated by Santa 
Monica restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"We see the same faces over and over again," Antoinette Bill, one of the 
volunteers, said on a windy afternoon recently, after dishing out chicken wings 
and turkey-noodle soup. "A lot of new faces too. It's the consistent ones that 
are the most difficult. You know that for them, this is it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Must Move 
</P>
<P>
But two problems are forcing the program to move. One is security; recently, 
rowdy fights have been breaking out as people wait for food. Also, area 
merchants have complained about the presence of homeless in the park and are 
urging the city to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of this month, the program will move to grounds between City Hall 
and the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"We like being outside, but it gets disruptive," said Mimi Adams, who heads the 
program, called FAITH, which also tries to find housing for some of the 
homeless. "We're dealing with people who are very unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
Although many businesses complain about the homeless, others have taken a new 
approach. The Chamber of Commerce, which five years ago printed advertisements 
in newspapers calling for the removal of "drunks and derelicts" to make Santa 
Monica safe again, recently set up a committee on the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Among the committee's efforts is assisting Councilman David Finkel in his 
search for a piece of property where the city can set up 10 trailers for the 
homeless. The trailers will come from Los Angeles, which acquired them a couple 
of years ago but has been able to place only a few because of neighborhood 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber of Commerce members have experienced a major shift in attitude, Finkel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They realized you can't just say, 'Get rid of them' and solve the problem," 
Finkel said. "They realized you have to roll up your sleeves and get into the 
issue (and) get into what you have to do to help."

FIRE CHIEF PUSHES FOR TOYS AS ALTERNATIVE TO FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Chief Don Manning was mulling over how bans on fireworks 
dampened the Fourth of July spirits of his five grandchildren when he started 
thinking about fire-safe toys that could fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering, boy, that would be nice rather than Grandpa saying 'no, no, 
no' to fireworks," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
One day, he mentioned his thoughts to Jerry Pressman, a former board member of 
the National Fire Academy and president of a Los Angeles firm that designs 
fire-protection systems. Pressman discussed the possibilities with Northridge 
businessman Jeff Rapport and, four months ago, Funnerworks Corp. was born in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the firm began marketing its line of toys, including 
battery-operated sparklers, screaming balloon whistles and fire-retardant 
bubble mats that make big pops when jumped on because they are reinforced with 
nylon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intended as a Catalyst 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which will cease selling the toys July 5, is intended strictly as a 
catalyst to encourage major toy companies to create similar products, Pressman 
said. The products will be sold only through charitable organizations and 
volunteer auxiliaries of fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Rapport and anonymous donors he described as concerned fire 
professionals, Funnerworks will limit its profits to 10%. Portions of every 
sale and profits above 10% will be given to the Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn 
Foundation of Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide organization, which promotes education for fire and burn 
prevention, was formed in 1971 as a memorial to Alisa Ann Ruch, an 8-year-old 
from the San Fernando Valley who was fatally burned in a back-yard barbecue 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Highly Appreciative' 
</P>
<P>
"We're highly appreciative of anything that would divert people's attention to 
less harmful things" than fireworks, said Monrovia Fire Chief Mark Foote at a 
news conference in Monrovia, where the burn foundation has a branch office. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that he is not endorsing any particular product, Manning said he is 
"pleased that the private sector is responding to a need we see as a fire 
service. We had a strong understanding from the very beginning that there would 
be no profit." 
</P>
<P>
The toys are available for sale at the foundation's Monrovia office on Colorado 
Boulevard. Beginning July 1, they also will be sold at Santa Monica Community 
College. For other locations, call (800) 334-SAFE.

CLOSURE OF TRAUMA CENTER IN WHITTIER EXPECTED TO HURT QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The closure of the trauma unit at Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital in 
Whittier probably will cause further deterioration in the quality of health 
care in the San Gabriel Valley, hospital and county health officials said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
But they said the impact will be softened by being spread among facilities 
throughout the San Gabriel Valley, southeastern Los Angeles County and northern 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a little fallout on all the hospitals in the area," said 
Virginia Price-Hastings, who oversees the county's trauma network. She said 
community hospitals will have to begin treating more patients, many of whom 
have no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference Wednesday, Presbyterian Intercommunity officials 
confirmed that they will end the 358-bed hospital's participation in the trauma 
center network. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Will Have to Cope 
</P>
<P>
Price-Hastings said the closure will mean that hospitals such as Queen of the 
Valley in West Covina and Greater El Monte Community in South El Monte will 
have to cope with severely injured patients who would normally have been taken 
to the trauma center at Presbyterian Intercommunity. 
</P>
<P>
These patients will be taken to the closest emergency room, she said. But 
unlike trauma centers, emergency rooms are not required to have a surgeon and 
anesthesiologist on duty at all times. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most affected by the closure, Price-Hastings said, will be hospitals 
that serve residents of El Monte, South El Monte, West Covina, Hacienda 
Heights, La Puente, La Mirada, Norwalk, Artesia, Bell, Bell Gardens and Downey. 
</P>
<P>
But Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, the only remaining trauma center 
in the San Gabriel Valley, will probably not receive more trauma patients, she 
said. Huntington officials say the 606-bed hospital loses about $1.8 million a 
year on its trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responsibility Unchanged 
</P>
<P>
Price-Hastings said she has assured Huntington officials that their 
responsibility will remain the same: caring for the critically injured within a 
20-minute ambulance ride. 
</P>
<P>
Yet an overriding problem remains: In the last three years, the trauma center 
network has dwindled from 23 hospitals to 13. "Our goal is to retain what's 
left of the trauma system and stop the domino effect of closures," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, Price-Hastings said, will require additional money from the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We remain optimistic that by July or August there will be more money in the 
state budget to help pay for health care of the uninsured," Price-Hastings 
said. Otherwise, she said, the system will soon collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The system was created in 1986 to provide a network of hospitals throughout the 
county so that people who suffer traumatic injury could get speedy, quality 
treatment at a facility nearby. Trauma centers provide round-the-clock staff to 
handle gunshot wounds, traffic accidents and extreme multiple injuries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Finance 
</P>
<P>
The system is costly. And, from a business standpoint, it is difficult to 
finance, partly because of the nature of the injuries and the type of people 
who are injured. Trauma patients tend to be young men who frequently have no 
medical insurance to pay for the expensive and extensive care that they 
require. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's press conference, Presbyterian Intercommunity President 
Lowell W. Smith said in a prepared statement: "We have all witnessed the steady 
deterioration of the trauma system that has made the network in the San Gabriel 
Valley almost non-existent and woefully ineffective." 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier hospital's trauma center will close Aug. 7. Previously, officials 
at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank announced that their hospital's 
trauma center will close June 19. Last year, the two institutions handled more 
than 1,000 traumatic injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Presbyterian Intercommunity officials said the closure is necessary because of 
the high cost of subsidizing the care of uninsured patients whose hospital 
bills are not being adequately reimbursed from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Dr. John S. Marsh, chairman of the hospital's trauma committee, 
cited two reasons why the hospital has lost $2.7 million on its trauma center 
this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
One problem, he said, has been County-USC Medical Center's "frequent inability 
to accept the transfer of stabilized indigent patients." Another is that trauma 
patients have been brought to the hospital from outside its geographic area, as 
defined by the county's trauma network. 
</P>
<P>
Price-Hastings said: "Whittier Presbyterian has eased its financial problem, 
but in the process has spread it out among other hospitals." In 1988, the 
hospital treated 433 trauma patients. 
</P>
<P>
At Huntington Memorial, public affairs manager Peg Kean said: "The main 
question that we're going to continue to ask ourselves is: If the trauma system 
virtually no longer exists, what does that mean to us? As each hospital closes 
its trauma center, it becomes a more pertinent question." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kean said, Pasadena hospital considers its trauma center "an important 
community service." 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia, Pomona 
Valley Community Hospital in Pomona and Queen of the Valley in West Covina 
operated trauma centers. But all these hospitals dropped out because of the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Have Effect 
</P>
<P>
An official at Greater El Monte Community Hospital said the closure of the 
Whittier trauma center would almost certainly have an effect on the 115-bed El 
Monte facility.

MONTEREY PARK OKS INCREASES IN CITY FEES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite continuing objections from representatives of the city's business 
community, the City Council has given final approval to across-the-board 
increases of fees for services, including business licenses, library use and 
tennis lessons. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-1 vote last Monday reflected the same breakdown as when the council last 
month tentatively approved the fee increases. City officials said the increases 
will generate an additional $1.2 million in revenues each year. 
</P>
<P>
This additional money, city officials said, will be used to make up a shortfall 
in the general fund budget. (On Tuesday night, the council gave final approval 
to a $16.8-million general fund budget for the coming fiscal year, which 
represents $4 million in cuts from this year's budget.) 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Christopher F. Houseman, the lone dissenting vote each time on 
the fee increases, maintains that the council should have taken more time with 
this "very, very complicated problem." 
</P>
<P>
One of his main complaints, he said, centers on city officials' failure to 
involve members of the business community as well as a broad, cross section of 
residents in the decision-making process. The city, he said, should have put 
together a blue-ribbon committee. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Rossman, incoming vice president of the Monterey Park Chamber of 
Commerce, said she wished that city officials had given notice earlier that the 
fees might be increased. "The business community just wanted to have more of a 
voice in this," said Rossman, a promotion manager for AT &amp; T in Monterey 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
She additionally questioned the soundness of the utility tax on interstate and 
overseas business phone calls. Merchants also had registered their complaints 
about increases in the hotel and motel room tax and the installation of parking 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Barry L. Hatch, referring to all of the increases, said "the 
fees are very fair." He noted that many had not been increased in eight to 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
He did acknowledge a communication problem among city officials, council 
members and the business community. 
</P>
<P>
"But rather than to put up fences, we need to start fresh. We need to work 
together and make it one community. We could have perhaps made more of an 
effort to contact (business leaders) earlier," he said.

L.A. ADDS CURB-SIDE RECYCLING AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of Rancho Park, Beverlywood, Cheviot Hills and parts of Westchester 
will be able to recycle their cans, bottles and newspapers by leaving them at 
the curb starting this week, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The voluntary program allows households to sort their recyclable trash into 
plastic bins that will be collected by special trucks on garbage day. 
</P>
<P>
The trucks will also pick up separate bundles or bags of newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"By making it easy and convenient to recycle, we're helping the residents of 
this area do their part for the environment," said City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, one of the backers of the trial program. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the 11th Council District, represented by Councilman Marvin 
Braude, have had a similar program for several years, but the new service 
expands curb-side recycling to 60,000 more households, including about 5,000 
each in the districts represented by Yaroslavsky and Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
Its sponsors hope to gradually expand the service to other neighborhoods until 
it is offered citywide in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"At current rates of trash disposal, the city will run out of landfill space in 
just a few years," said Edward J. Avila, president of the Board of Public 
Works. "Recycling is a simple but very effective way for residents to 
participate in the solution to the garbage crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation trucks began dropping off the plastic bins, which cost the city 
$5.25 each, at homes in the new area starting last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Specially equipped trucks, each costing about $80,000, are to pick up the 
refuse once a week and take it to one of four recycling plants, where it will 
be separated mechanically for resale.

OUTTAKES: POOR LITTLE RICH FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever wonder what it takes to realize profits from a bona fide box office 
blockbuster? We came by UA's first profit statement for "Rain Man" -- with 
current grosses nearing $170 million in North America -- which offers a glimpse 
into studio accounting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The document covers the period ending last February, when "Rain Man" had 
grossed about $120 million in North America. Even at that point, UA figured, 
the $28 million film was still almost $40 million in the red. 
</P>
<P>
While UA listed its share of the $120 million gross as $52 million (the rest 
went to theater owners), it had collected only $24.9 million of that amount. 
From the $24.9 million, $7 million was deducted for the company's distribution 
fee, in addition to its distribution expenses of $23.8 million -- such as $18 
million for advertising and $2.8 million for 1,500 prints. Additionally, 
$912,000 had been paid to gross profit participants, including Dustin Hoffman 
and director Barry Levinson. All told, $31.7 million was deducted as expenses. 
</P>
<P>
After subtracting that amount from the actual revenue of $24.9 million in hand, 
a deficit of roughly $6.8 million remained. 
</P>
<P>
Now, add in the $28 million production cost, plus 15% of the film's budget for 
studio overhead, and you're left with red ink amounting to roughly $39.1 
million. Mentioned but not calculated in the report were interest fees that UA 
will assess against the production. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman noted that, with the outstanding collections, additional 
domestic theatrical rentals, plus foreign theatrical and video coin, UA expects 
to see a healthy "Rain Man" profit down the line. Leonard Klady

James Bond has come up against some stiff opposition: the British Board of Film 
Censors. "Licence to Kill," which will have its world premiere Tuesday night in 
London, has been rated "15" in Britain. This prohibits anyone 15 or under from 
seeing the picture -- the first such restriction for an 007 film, which 
traditionally gets a "PG." 
</P>
<P>
Co-producer Michael G. Wilson said the producers attempted to appease the 
British censors by cutting 38 seconds of violence from five different scenes. 
"But we reached a point where we thought the film would suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, the rating is a disappointment," said Wilson. With an estimated 15% 
of the British population age 15 or under, he said, "There are going to be a 
lot of disappointed young people. It's also going to cause some difficulty 
among older people. In Britain -- unlike the U.S. -- moviegoing is still a 
family experience." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. audiences get to see "Licence to Kill" when it opens here July 14 in more 
than 2,000 theaters -- rated PG-13. Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: NUDITY REQUIRED

Producer Howard Rosenman, in the early stages of casting his Josephine Baker 
biopic, tells us that Whitney Houston is among those who have discussed playing 
the role of the legendary black American singer, whose bump-and-grind 
toplessness made her a sensation in Paris of the '20s and '30s. "Whitney was a 
little concerned about the nudity involved, but she realizes its absolute 
necessity," Rosenman told us. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenman, along with Alain Sarde and Michael Braun, hope to shoot the Orion 
film in early 1990. Playwright George Wolfe ("The Colored Museum") is 
completing the screenplay; Hugh Hudson ("Chariots of Fire") will direct. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's story has had several false starts with other producers. A rival 
production, "Josephine and Me," is currently being developed by French 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
"We think our slant is unique," said Rosenman. "It's the story of an expatriate 
who was never recognized at home because of prejudices. After her success in 
Europe, she returned to the U.S. in 1936 and was treated like a curiosity. It 
was the heartbreak of her life." Leonard Klady

Both Time and Newsweek, meanwhile, gave surprisingly generous coverage to Paul 
Bartel's "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills," which opened 
nationwide on only one screen. The reason: neither newsweekly could get an 
early "Star Trek 5" screening to make the deadline for last week's editions. 
Bartel's little picture "got lucky," Corliss explained.

A 10th show at the Forum is set for July 2. No other artist has played more 
than six shows at the hall during a single engagement. . . . Eddie Murphy's 
first album in four years, "So Happy," is due in August. The comedian, who had 
a surprise pop hit in 1985 with "Party All the Time," worked this time with 
producers Narada Michael Walden (who did the honors on the first single, "Put 
Your Mouth on Me"), Nile Rodgers and Cameo's Larry Blackmon. . . . Joni 
Mitchell, Kate Bush and Iggy Pop are among the artists featured on the new 
"Spirit of the Forest" single, designed to raise awareness of destruction of 
tropical rain forests.

Linda Ronstadt will join a host of '50s acts -- including the Platters and 
Rosie &amp; the Originals -- in concerts July 1-2 at Cal State L.A. Ronstadt 
will perform songs from her Spanish-language album "Canciones de Mi Padre" at 
the shows, which benefit the Hollenbeck Youth Center in Boyle Heights. . . . 
Director Oliver Stone has optioned the film rights to Danny Sugerman's rock 'n' 
roll coming-of-age memoir, "Wonderland Avenue: Tales of Glamour &amp; Excess." 
Sugerman worked his way into the Doors' organization at age 13 and continues to 
act as the band's spokesman. . . . Malcolm McLaren's first album in four years, 
"Waltz Darling," is due next month. The guiding force behind the Sex Pistols 
released a single, "Deep in Vogue," last week. . . . Lou Adler didn't have to 
look far when he wanted an oldie for his group Native. The reggae band chose 
Sam Cooke's 1960 hit "Wonderful World," which Adler wrote 30 years ago with 
Cooke and Herb Alpert -- whose A&amp;M Records distributes Adler's recently 
reactivated Ode Sounds &amp; Visuals.

RECORD RACK: CHERRY DEBUTS IN SASSY STYLE;

NENEH CHERRY 
</P>
<P>
"Raw Like Sushi." Virgin. ****: POP STARS ***** Great Balls of Fire **** 
Knockin' On Heaven's Door *** Good Vibrations ** Maybe Baby * Ain't That a 
Shame 
</P>
<P>
Sassy, silly, socially aware, hep-talking, hip-hopping and above all headstrong 
-- this is singer/rapper Neneh Cherry, who, on the strength of her debut album, 
could and should be the next superstar of black music, a genre that could use a 
female superstar or two. 
</P>
<P>
Her astonishingly fine and vital "Raw Like Sushi" dips into any number of great 
pop traditions -- from early soul to modern scratching and sampling -- but 
bears the unmistakable stamp of a unique, living, breathing human who would 
eventually have to be invented if she didn't already exist. 
</P>
<P>
The lead track, "Buffalo Stance," may be the year's best single, good for 
instant replay after replay with its tough, sweet street-talk and a brilliantly 
mixed-for-stereo synthesizer obbligato that won't quit. This offers a tease of 
what's best about the whole LP: The way Cherry moves from a rapped verse into a 
sung chorus and back again has all the charming ease of the way the best movie 
musicals effortlessly glide from dialogue into extravagant production numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Though Cherry is English, her accent sounds unaffectedly New Yawk-ish at times, 
which doesn't hurt the gritty feel of the Big Apple-focused "Inner City Mamma." 
</P>
<P>
And when you think of comparisons here, you think of the greats: the ballad 
"Manchild" sounds like something man-child Michael Jackson himself might have 
come up with, only more melodically inventive; "The Next Generation" and "So 
Here I Come" are innovative party blowouts that recall the finest Prince jams; 
the slicker "Heart" sounds like what Diana Ross would be doing if she still had 
integrity, and the way Cherry reads the signs o' the times -- on everything 
from urban depression to the cautions and celebrations of childbirth to "sexual 
survival" -- easily puts her in Marvin Gaye's class. 
</P>
<P>
Is this the essential dance long-player of the year or what?

NATALIE COLE "Good to Be Back." Capitol *** 1/2: POP STARS ***** Great Balls of 
Fire **** Knockin' On Heaven's Door *** Good Vibrations ** Maybe Baby * Ain't 
That a Shame 
</P>
<P>
Cole's follow-up to her gold comeback album "Everlasting" incorporates a 
dazzling variety of styles. The songs range from the elegant, theatrical single 
"Miss You Like Crazy" to the spicy, Latin-tinged title song to a jazzy remake 
of the Ink Spots' standard "Someone's Rockin' My Dreamboat." Often when an 
artist tackles such a wide array of styles on an album, the results are 
self-consciously showy. But Cole makes it all seem natural and effortless. She 
can be hot and intense, but is equally convincing when she's cool and 
sophisticated. Her purity and control bring out all of the beauty of the two 
Michael Masser ballads, but she can turn right around and be sassy and playful, 
as on the relaxed, finger-popping "As a Matter of Fact." In the credits, Cole 
thanks her "rainbow coalition" of seven producers, each of whom specializes in 
a different style of music. The ultimate credit, however, belongs to Cole for 
holding it together. PAUL GREIN

KOOL MOE DEE "Knowledge Is King. " Jive/RCA ***: POP STARS ***** Great Balls of 
Fire **** Knockin' On Heaven's Door *** Good Vibrations ** Maybe Baby * Ain't 
That a Shame 
</P>
<P>
In the rap genre, stardom often comes and goes faster than many rhymers can 
say, "Yo, baby, yo!" A rapper that's not in touch with the streets may as well 
turn in his gold chains. Kool Moe Dee has remained one of the most 
well-respected rappers on the scene since his first album was released in early 
1987. With this third album Moe maintains the sense of humor and social 
conscience that made his name for him, while managing to land a few poetic 
punches at rival LL Cool J (the target of the last album's title cut, "How Ya 
Like Me Now"). 
</P>
<P>
Boasting is still Kool Moe's most dangerous weapon; both this LP's title cut 
and its debut single, "They Want Money," find the rhymer flaunting his 
fast-paced life style while kicking out some wicked dance beats, but on the 
title cut the bragging is tempered with a message for black consciousness 
that's definitely in touch with the times. For today's more speed-conscious 
dancers, "I Go to Work" goes a long way toward proving Moe Dee the hardest 
working rapper in show business, while "Pump Your Fist" is a powerful rock 
anthem-turned-rap that should emerge as another hit. Co-producer Teddy Riley 
(Keith Sweat, Guy) ensures that the answer to "How Ya Like Me Now" will remain 
a positive one. DUFF MARLOWE

COUSTEAU WATCH: EXXON SPILL: HOW CLEAN IS CLEAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Alaska's Prince William Sound, workers steam-gunned a rocky beach, pushing 
oil into the receding tide. Every day, in 12-hour shifts, nearly 100 men and 
women rinsed oil from rocks. The muck slid into the sea, and was held from open 
water by an arc of boom. The crew had to work fast down the shore, so that a 
skimming machine could suck up the oily residue before high tide carried it 
back. The workers had been over the beach three times in late May, removing 
about five barrels of oil during one shift alone, and still they weren't done. 
</P>
<P>
Financing an arsenal of more than 8,000 people supported by U.S. military ships 
and planes, Exxon plans to use this and similar methods to attack about 300 
miles of tainted sound by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
As of June 1, only one mile of beach had been certified "clean" by the U.S. 
Coast Guard, said a Coast Guard spokesman. He said "clean" means "all oil that 
could be removed without changing topography of the island had been removed." 
</P>
<P>
But as our team observed, "clean" is a relative term. 
</P>
<P>
Although rocks on that mile of beach may no longer glisten with oil, they are 
still spotted with it. As our team saw, such tiny shelled creatures as limpets, 
which usually cling to the undersides of stones, were dead or dying. A black 
swath of oily residue spread across the upper beach. Above the beach, among the 
boulders, there was still raw crude oil, where indeed only a bulldozer could 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
This "clean" section of beach may represent the best oil-spill muscle and 
machinery that can be marshaled in the United States, and perhaps the world. 
But clean is more than a matter of what one sees. 
</P>
<P>
Underwater, Prince William Sound appeared relatively clean, but oil may have 
mixed with bottom sediment. In a limited series of dives, our team saw no 
sunken oil. Yet we know that oil can cling to silt and microscopic animals that 
thrive in the marine environment, the planktonic food of fish, crab and shrimp, 
which in turn become food for birds, otters and seals. Oil contamination 
invisible to the eye may leave effects behind for many years, effects that will 
be difficult to measure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coagulated With Oil 
</P>
<P>
Even though we saw no seals on or near the "clean" beach, we saw many seals in 
waters off Knight Island. Most had coats so stiff with coagulated oil they 
looked as if they had been tarred. Even relatively "clean" seals may suffer 
nervous system and internal organ damage, blindness, pneumonia and other 
chronic problems that could lead to death, all from simply breathing the toxic 
fumes of oil. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the seal pupping season in mid-May, Alaska state marine 
biologists found two pups dead in the oily shallow waters of a small bay. 
Scientists said the pups had been born alive, suggesting they were healthy pups 
entering an unhealthy environment. "We will never see all the dead ones, 
considering how much area is involved," one of the scientists remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Seals can re-oil themselves each time they come in and out of the water, or as 
they slide on oil-soaked seaweed covering rocks. Whether the seals can 
successfully molt their stiffened fur remains to be seen later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Although the formidable cleanup plan took seal pupping and other seasonal 
factors into account, it is precisely the magnitude and complexity of the 
clean-up that is frightening. 
</P>
<P>
How often will we be willing or able to repeat such an undertaking? 
</P>
<P>
As of June 1, cleanup costs for the Prince William Sound accident exceeded $115 
million, a variety of commercial fisheries had been closed and 22,000 seabirds, 
732 otters, various raptors and other animals were known dead. And this is only 
a percentage of the total number believed killed by the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
The original source of the oil, Prudhoe Bay, will be "played out by the turn of 
the century," Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl said in a recent interview. Thus, 
the Alaska pipeline finished in 1977 will have delivered oil for only about 25 
years. During this bought time, little advance has been made in finding safer, 
more efficient forms of energy. U.S. automobiles are not even required to 
attain 30 miles per gallon of gasoline. In other words, Prince William Sound 
has seen great sacrifice for little progress in alternatives to oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risky Business 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we could drill for more oil in the untouched Arctic, and risk 
another accident. Or perhaps drill off the shores of pristine Antarctica, where 
the already-wrecked Argentine tanker Bahia Paraiso remains loaded with 70,000 
gallons of oil, its rescue unfinished as an icy winter approaches that could 
crush the ship like an egg. How could we "clean" such remote seas and terrain? 
</P>
<P>
As for Alaska, the Exxon Valdez oil spill cursed an estimated 700 miles of 
shoreline overall. Perhaps in years or decades, nature will clean every mile. 
But nature does not exist to correct our mistakes. That we should correct them 
ourselves is the warning from imperially beautiful Prince William Sound.

ON VIEW: DEBUTANTES MAKE AN ENTRANCE AND HEAR FROM A 'VALLEY BOY' 
</P>

His Excellency the Most Rev. Roger Michael Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, 
spoke of Indiana Jones' search for the Grail at the Social Service Auxiliary's 
Presentation Ball, and then exhorted debutantes: "Accept this youthful honor 
with the responsibility and dedication and commitment that comes with it." He 
urged them, as members of "prominent families," to have "a great hope for other 
people" and to be "full-time participants in our church and our society." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gretchen Wayne: "He's a Valley boy -- we went to grammar school together 
-- he was special then." 
</P>
<P>
Ball chairwoman Jayne Sullivan and her husband, Roger, presented their fifth 
daughter, Carolyn. The ballroom was adorned with hundreds of hydrangeas by 
Patty Burschinger. 
</P>
<P>
Other debutantes: Laura Barnoski, Kimberly Cashin, Francesca Chase, Elizabeth 
Conrad, Kelli Ann Raycraft Cooper, Heather Duffy, Megan Forsyth, Lisa Gurash, 
Alyce Hamilton, Anne Hammers, Nicole Harnett, Sabrina Kaleta, May Loftus, 
Charla Ludweig, Kathleen May, Martha McNiff, Sheila McNiff, Michelle Mueller, 
Julie Nunn, Shea O'Connor, Heather Plut, Anne Schmutz, Katherine Stuppy, 
Christen Uniack, Sabrina Van Dine, Mary Wilson and Jennifer Woods. 
</P>
<P>
A HIT: Nancy Reagan, "drunk," "hits" two cars and three trees. It "happened" -- 
all in the good cause of battling substance abuse -- this week at the Museum 
and Science Industry when the former First Lady sampled the hands-on "Lifestyle 
Choices" exhibit underwritten by the National Health Foundation (NHF). 
</P>
<P>
In the simulation, museum-goers step into a car, push buttons to choose what 
they want to drink or smoke. Then they take the consequences, hitting trees and 
cars on a video. Mrs. Reagan is honorary chair of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
For the day, Dickinson C. Ross, chairman of NHF, planned a delightful luncheon 
under a white tent overlooking Exposition Park's rose garden. Lodwrick M. Cook, 
chairman of ARCO, underwrote the affair. 
</P>
<P>
And those fighting drugs -- Police Chief Daryl Gates and the nation's drug czar 
William Bennett were at center tables. Said Bennett: "This drug war will end." 
Sitting between Mrs. Reagan and his wife, Gaby, Ross said: "It's very possible 
this little project will get on wheels and move across the nation." 
</P>
<P>
PROOF: Said Wallis Annenberg: "Proof of a person is when idealism is matched by 
her deeds." 
</P>
<P>
Friends turned out en masse for the Sephardic Hebrew Academy tribute to her. "I 
am happy to have so much friendship tonight," she said, on the arm of her 
youngest son Charles (just graduated from Duke, and resembling his grandfather, 
former Ambassador to the Court of St. James Walter Annenberg). 
</P>
<P>
Tossing accolades were Ali MacGraw, Jimmy Stewart and Joan Rivers. "Wallis was 
the second to call after my husband committed suicide," Rivers said, and, on a 
lighter note, she said of Annenberg: "Some people are born with silver spoons 
in their mouths; she was born with a silver tea service." 
</P>
<P>
PAST PERFECT: Last year's Southwest Fest on the lawn at Eileen and Bill 
Zimmerman's home was such a kick that people were calling to be on the mailing 
list for this year. The Pasadena Mental Health Center starred again. 
</P>
<P>
Co-chairs Melinda Winston and Esmeralda Gibson and Marla Carter made a 14-hour 
buying spree to Rosarita Beach, bringing back bargain baskets and pots for the 
party's open-air mercado. Mary Ann Sturgeon won a cameo performance in 
California Music Theatre's upcoming "Pajama Game." It was de rigueur to eat 
chili in the Frito packages. Doing that were Dave and Holly Davis, Judy Brandt, 
Sheryl Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Zimmermans co-hosted, he and his daughter, Amanda Zimmerman, were in 
Beijing that night. In spite of the uprising, they continued on with three days 
of tours there and are now in Hong Kong. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The next night, the Pasadena Symphony Juniors capered through a murder mystery 
gala at the William Leslie estate -- chairwomen Dolores Kroop and Linda 
Shamsid-Deen orchestrating. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And, summer elegance had its forte in lawn games at the Almansor Center 
Auxiliary's do in Patty and Davis Pillsbury's garden. 
</P>
<P>
ABOUT TOWN: Tennis impresario Wendell Niles Jr. hosted luncheon at Val's in 
Toluca Lake honoring Prince Rainier of Monaco. Later this summer, Wendell 
stages a Pro-Celebrity Tennis Tournament in Monte Carlo for the Princess Grace 
Foundation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Eamer can identify with a challenge. She's a former schoolteacher and 
she and Peggie Bales hosted lunch at the Bistro Garden for a crowd to say that 
they'll co-chair a literacy dinner Sept. 25 at the Beverly Wilshire. They are 
expecting to honor Barbara Bush. It's to be staged by Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
20TH ANNIVERSARY: Art Neff headed the Flight Test Historical Foundation's 
tribute to aerospace at the Los Angeles Hilton, feting Neil Armstrong, Buzz 
Aldrin and Mike Collins of Apollo 11. Now the Aldrins -- Lois and Buzz -- are 
in Paris for the air show and the 20th Apollo 11 celebration before returning 
for the tour for his new book "Men From Earth" published by Bantam.

ZAN THOMPSON: IN A CLASS BY THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The kindergartners came out of the double doors like flying pieces of popcorn. 
The first-graders with their superior experience and dignity came out like 
vestrymen, bent on a solemn task. They had all been in the same place -- at the 
Valentine School Art Show. 
</P>
<P>
This was the windup of a year's work in art, put together by the PTA at 
Valentine School, a public school in San Marino. This was the second year of 
the Art Festival, and it was a roaring success, especially with the young 
artists, who ranged from kindergarten to the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cindy Roe, whose son Trevor was a first-grader at Valentine, and 
some other mothers decided that the kids needed to learn something about art. 
"Art is not caught. It must be taught" became their rallying slogan. Because of 
school budget cuts that came from Sacramento, things thought of as frill 
courses had been eliminated. Roe and her co-chairwoman, Susie Bishop, 
determined that they would teach the kids something about art. 
</P>
<P>
Roe was an art history major at UCLA, and she was delighted to be able to do 
something with her knowledge that would enrich the kids. Roe and Bishop and 48 
PTA volunteers gave hundreds of hours of work to the classes. 
</P>
<P>
Each grade studies one facet of art at a time. 
</P>
<P>
In kindergarten, the children studied line, looking at pictures by Klee, 
Picasso, Miro and Mondrian. Then they painted their own pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The first grade studied shape, real and abstract, illustrated by the works of 
Rousseau, Cezanne and Matisse. 
</P>
<P>
In second grade, the subject was color, and how it changes the way we feel 
about a picture. The children were exposed to the works of Joshua Reynolds, 
Mary Cassatt, Mark Rothko, Georges Seurat and Gainsborough. The kids loved it 
more with every lesson. 
</P>
<P>
The third grade studied texture, both visual and tactile. There were lovely, 
knobby pictures, and satin smooth ones inspired by Van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, 
Monet, Rembrandt and the Cluny tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-graders studied form in sculpture and architecture. Roe said these 
classes were held out on the lawn, the biggest rather organized exercise in mud 
pie making in the land. And they learned about Michelangelo and Rodin. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-graders combined all of the elements of art in their work and learned 
about Gilbert Stuart, Andrew Wyeth, Edward Hopper and Severin Roesen. 
</P>
<P>
At the exhibit I met the school principal, an easy, charming lady named Mary 
Meye. She managed all year to keep the art display room off limits. Even on 
rainy days, when the classes usually have gym and recess inside, Meye saved the 
space for the art work and classes. To give a clear idea of how the lady 
thinks: Every room in the school has a large printed sign reading, "I will 
respect myself and others." Good tenet. 
</P>
<P>
Roe told me that the kids' excitement level stayed at the explosion point all 
year. Seeing what was on the wall by another class, they'd ask, "When do we get 
to do that?" They waited for class every week on the door sill and had to be 
scooted out when class was over. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, every child in school had at least one picture in the 
exhibition. The volunteers took the works home and mounted them on bright 
construction paper. Cindy Roe's husband, Richard, was willingly dragooned into 
putting up corkboard to display the pictures. He tricked up the entrance to the 
exhibit with stanchions and bright white chains and plywood painted like a 
Grecian portico with columns and an imposing lintel, and set the corkboards at 
angles to give the feeling of corridors. This made the kids feel as if they 
were going into a real art museum. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit opened with an evening reception for the artists. Roe also conjured 
up a money-raising fillip for the exhibit. She had packets of note paper 
printed, each one with a picture made by a young artist. One is after Georges 
Seurat -- pointillism by a second-grader of a man in a tall Sunday afternoon 
hat, standing against a dappled grassy bank under a blue sky and holding a 
lovely mandarin orange umbrella. Another card was done after the kids had seen 
Cezanne's "Tulips in the Vase." The third card was inspired by a Picasso of a 
hand holding a bunch of flowers. The fourth picture is a lovely, misty iris 
done in watercolor. 
</P>
<P>
Another Roe-Bishop production is an apron of heavy muslin with a strap around 
the neck. It is bright white, wildly speckled and sprayed. It was inspired the 
day the kids encountered Jackson Pollock. Across the top of the apron, it says, 
"You've got to have art." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time parents have pitched in at the school. Two years 
ago, the parents painted the outside of Valentine School from top to bottom in 
a testimonial to their determination that their children would not be 
shortchanged. They won't, as long as Roe and Bishop and their 48 compatriots 
are convinced that you've got to have art.

The young man said it seemed only natural to join a neighborhood gang along 
with many of his friends. His father was a gang member, and so was his 
grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
"We all try to take care of each other, watch everybody's back," the youth said 
in a recent interview at a Norwalk park. He asked that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs have been a part of Norwalk for generations. But they have come under 
increased scrutiny from law enforcement officials and community leaders because 
of the May 9 shooting death of a high school football star, a gang-related 
shoot-out that left two wounded on May 28, and other recent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say Norwalk's gangs -- which operate primarily in Latino 
neighborhoods and involve youths battling over turf -- are far less violent 
than the groups that fight over drug profits in other parts of Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Still, statistics provided by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department show 
gang crime is on the rise in the area served by its Norwalk station. 
Gang-related crime incidents in the area, which includes Norwalk, Santa Fe 
Springs, La Mirada and an unincorporated county area near Whittier, exceeded 
the 2,000 mark for the first time last year. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, fearing that gangs will become more violent and threaten the 
city's economic and cultural future, recently approved Norwalk's first 
comprehensive anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
"We could very easily become the slum area of Southeast Los Angeles," 
Councilman Marcial (Rod) Rodriguez said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Gang activity in Norwalk dates back to the 1940s when Councilman Rodriguez was 
a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd see the guys out there then, just like today, walking the streets, 
standing on the corner," said Rodriguez, who ran with members of a local gang 
but never considered himself a member. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman was 13 years old in 1945 when his family moved into an area 
known as Varrio Norwalk, a pocket of working-class Latino families in a 
predominantly Anglo area. Today, the mostly Latino neighborhood of modest homes 
and corner markets stretches north from 166th Street to Hopland Street, and 
east from Pioneer Boulevard to Norwalk Boulevard. It is the largest barrio in 
Norwalk and one of the most active gang areas. It was about one-fifth as large 
in the 1940s, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez became friends with Varrio Norwalk gang members shortly after he 
entered the seventh grade. He began hanging around with them, and later, 
partying and fighting alongside them. 
</P>
<P>
"You're part of it. You're part of the environment," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as today, the battles were turf oriented, fed by neighborhood pride and 
youthful bravado. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy from Norwalk starts dating a gal from (Varrio) Carmelas and that would 
set it off," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's oldest rivalry, which has existed for decades, involves gangs from 
Varrio Norwalk and Varrio Carmelas, a small enclave of homes on the southwest 
corner of Carmenita Road and Rosecrans Avenue. Locals do not remember exactly 
when the rivalry started between the city's two oldest barrios. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez recalls jumping into a fertilizer truck with about 20 other youths 
and heading into Carmelas -- a turf violation. Not much happened that night, 
but two days later, youths from Carmelas paid a return visit. 
</P>
<P>
"We were knocking on doors telling everybody 'There's Carmelas. They're 
invading our turf,' " Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Varrio Norwalk youths pelted several carloads of Carmelas with rocks. Carmelas 
answered with gunfire, Rodriguez said. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, the councilman denounced the violent, destructive actions of the 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"I came that close to going that way instead of this way," said Rodriguez, who 
is an insurance broker as well as a councilman. "I look back today and it was 
scary. How stupid it is, so senseless." 
</P>
<P>
The longtime resident said the number of gang members has grown over the years, 
as has Norwalk's population. And he said he considers contemporary gangs to be 
more dangerous because of the availability of guns and increased drug use by 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
But Rodriguez said the gangs fill a need, one common to virtually all people. 
</P>
<P>
"You belong to the Rotary, the Kiwanis, to the PTA," Rodriguez said. "We all 
have a sense, a need of belonging. What makes these kids so different?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grew Up in Neighborhood 
</P>
<P>
Several youths, who were hanging out on a street corner in Varrio Norwalk on a 
recent afternoon, said they were members of a local gang. 
</P>
<P>
Their turf is in the "One Ways," an area of Varrio Norwalk north of Alondra 
Boulevard, between Pioneer and Norwalk boulevards. Most of the youths said they 
grew up in the neighborhood, where narrow streets are restricted to one-way 
traffic and graffiti is plentiful. They spoke of partying, girls, pride in 
their barrio and defending their turf. "You just don't let anybody walk over 
you," one said. They also spoke of the periodic, aggressive strikes at other 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Casper, 19, who gave only his gang nickname, said he will be a gang member for 
the rest of his life. But he said his violent days are behind him now that he 
has a 3-month-old son and a construction job. 
</P>
<P>
Things were different several years ago when Casper was younger and wilder, and 
before he served a year at a county probation camp in connection with a foiled 
drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Casper said he was arrested by sheriff's deputies when he drove into another 
barrio with a .38-caliber handgun looking for several rival gang members. 
Casper said he would have emptied the gun into the gang members, whom he did 
not know personally, if he had not been stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"The gang (had) just started up," Casper said. "I wanted to make a name for 
myself. That's what everyone wants." 
</P>
<P>
None of the gang members older than 18 said they had earned a high school 
diploma. They told of being kicked out of one high school, and then another, 
before dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
"I got kicked out of every school for fighting," said Rascal, 18, who said he 
is a couple of credits shy of a high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
Several children stood by, watching the gang members. One boy, who said he was 
12 but looked younger, had gang lettering penned on his arm and on the back of 
his neck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varrio Carmelas Youths 
</P>
<P>
Across town, in Varrio Carmelas, three young men sat at a table at the local 
park. They were a few feet away from a memorial plaque by a young tree that 
reads, "This tree planted in the memory of Steven Razo by his many friends." 
Razo was killed in a drive-by shooting in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Like other gang members, those from Varrio Carmelas said they are highly 
protective of their turf. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going into your house, someone breaking into your house," said a 
20-year-old, who asked that his name not be used. "If they (rival gang members) 
hurt somebody, then we become our own judge." 
</P>
<P>
But gang members have mixed feelings about their barrios, where some families 
have been rooted for generations. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old recounted how the house of a relative had been raked with 
gunfire. The youth said he now lives with his grandmother in a nearby city but 
returns to Varrio Carmelas to be with fellow gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a family, I wouldn't bring them back over here," said the gang 
member, who drives a forklift for a living. "I don't want my little boy, if I 
have one, growing up with what I went through." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight Known Gangs 
</P>
<P>
There are eight known gangs with about 2,000 members in Norwalk, a city of 
about 90,000, said Sgt. Grotefend, gang detail supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The gangs are loosely organized alliances of cliques within Norwalk's various 
barrios. They do not force youths to be members, although there is peer 
pressure to join, officials and gang members said. Most Norwalk gangs "jump in" 
their members -- a prospective member must fight several gang members in order 
to join. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say Norwalk's gangs are not involved in the organized 
narcotics trade, which causes much of the violence in areas such as 
South-Central Los Angeles. But some of the Norwalk area gang members commit 
robberies to pay for drugs, gang investigator Richard Orosco said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is nickel-and-dime stuff with some gang members robbing fast-food places 
or liquor stores to get money to support their drug habits," Orosco said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said the fatal drive-by shooting of Juan Enriquez on May 9 
was the first gang-related murder in nearly three years in Norwalk. Enriquez, 
an honor student and football star, did not belong to a gang. But sheriff's 
deputies believe he was shot by a gang member. No one is in custody in 
connection with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Non-Gang Attacks 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk's gangs usually fight among themselves and with members of gangs in 
surrounding cities. Strikes against non-gang members in Norwalk have been rare, 
but they seemed to increase last month. 
</P>
<P>
On May 28, gang members shot up the Pontlavoy Avenue home of a non-member, who 
had been involved in several past confrontations with his attackers. The victim 
came under attack after he confronted a youth who was vandalizing his car, and 
reported the incident to sheriff's deputies, officials said. Two people were 
wounded in the shoot-out. Six adults and five juveniles have been charged with 
attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Enriquez killing, the last gang-related killings occurred in Norwalk 
when two groups feuded in May, 1986. Two men from each gang were shot or 
stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
There were three gang-related killings in the larger Norwalk station area in 
1982, one in 1983, five in 1984, six in 1985, the four in 1986, none in 1987 
and two in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's high of 2,000 gang-related incidents surpassed the previous record 
of 1,546, reported in 1985. The number of gang crimes for the first three 
months of this year is running at about the same rate as last year, according 
to sheriff's statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Al Grotefend, supervisor of the gang detail for the Norwalk substation, 
said part of the increase can be attributed to the discovery of more 
gain-related crime by more and better trained deputies. But he said there has 
been an actual increase in the number of gang crimes -- mostly nonviolent -- 
committed in the area over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Gang activity in the station area has increased in several crime categories 
since 1981, when the department's gang unit began working the area, according 
to department statistics. The department does not break out crime statistics 
for individual cities, Grotefend said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assaults, Robberies Up 
</P>
<P>
The number of felony assaults jumped from about 80 a year to 101 in 1985, and 
to 103 last year. Robberies, which average 50 to 60 a year, jumped to 91 in 
1985 and to a high of 93 in 1988. Weapons violations reached a high of 65 in 
1988. The previous high was 46 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Burglaries also reached a high of 190 last year. There were 114 in 1986, the 
second highest annual figure. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics violations have risen steadily over the years, reaching a high of 786 
in 1988. There were 661 in 1986 and 613 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Incidents in which gang members shot into inhabited dwellings reached a high of 
32 in 1988. Also up in 1988 were misdemeanor assaults (93) and auto thefts 
(49). 
</P>
<P>
Vandalism, however, decreased to 114 incidents last year, compared to a high of 
150 incidents in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in overall incidents of crime, Grotefend said Norwalk's 
gang problem is relatively small compared to an area such as South-Central Los 
Angeles; there were 18 gang-related homicides in the Los Angeles Police 
Department's 77th Street station area in the first four months of 1989, Officer 
Don Lawrence said. The station covers a portion of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Grotefend endorses Norwalk's new anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
"If nothing's done, the small problem they have now will turn into a larger 
problem down the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Barrio 
</P>
<P>
In a barrio called "Neighborhood," longtime resident Richard Rios spoke of the 
reasons underlying much of the gang activity, including discrimination and the 
alienation it creates, and the inability of local schools to reach some 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Varrio Neighborhood is centered at Angell Street south of Firestone Boulevard. 
It is one of Norwalk's newer barrios. But many homes, including Rios's, have 
bars on the windows. Rios is a welfare worker and former gang counselor who 
still tries to channel neighborhood children away from gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
Rios, 32, was a senior at Norwalk High School in the mid-1970s when about 20 
Latino youths from the area formed what they thought was a social club and 
called it Neighborhood Boys. Rios said the members were youths who did not do 
well in school and were not brought into school activities. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't belong to varsity football," said Rios, who became a member. "They 
made their club to belong to something." 
</P>
<P>
The school administration immediately became suspicious of the group, which 
liked to hang out at the Norwalk High pool, Rios said. Tensions between the 
Latino and Anglo students quickly grew to the point where more than 20 youths 
fought and were arrested in front of the high school in April, 1974, according 
to a local newspaper account. The Neighborhood Boys were quickly labeled a gang 
and started drawing attention from established gangs, Rios said. He said school 
officials should have worked harder to include the Neighborhood Boys in 
constructive activities. 
</P>
<P>
"When the majority saw you as a gang instead of a club, so it became," Rios 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rios said the city has neglected the gang problem as well as its barrios -- 
many of which contain dilapidated housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pool Became 'Bull Ring' 
</P>
<P>
He points to a spray pool at the Neighborhood's Vista Verde Park that was 
finished about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The spray pool, which youngsters run through as they would through lawn 
sprinklers, sat uncompleted for years and became known as the "bull ring," Rios 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted to become a member of Neighborhood, you had to stay in the bull 
ring and (fight) five guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rios, Rodriguez and other community members said improvements are needed in 
school and city programs to ensure involvement and future job success so youths 
won't feel the need to join gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Parents must also be educated to help children stay out of gangs, they said. 
Some veteran gang members may encourage their children to join. But other 
parents know little about gangs and feel powerless to keep their children from 
becoming members. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, whose son has been a long-time gang member, said she did not 
discover his involvement for years. She kicked him out of the house in 
desperation. The woman, who asked not to be identified, became teary-eyed at 
the thought of the Enriquez slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did it happen to a good kid?" she asked. "Why didn't it happen to mine, 
who brought so much danger to my home." 
</P>
<P>
To curb gang activity, Norwalk officials recently approved spending as much as 
$275,000 on the first city-funded anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the city has participated in multiagency, anti-gang programs that 
fell short. "The feeling was that everything was being done that was possible, 
kind of a false sense of security," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Starts in July 
</P>
<P>
The new program, which is expected to start in July, will use neighborhood 
counselors and a psychologist to steer youths away from gangs and toward jobs 
and recreational activities. At least one sheriff's deputy will be hired to run 
an anti-drug and alcohol program in the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
An anti-gang program for third- and fourth-grade students also will be started 
in the public schools in September, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is planning to build a gym to provide a variety of recreational 
activities, including boxing and weightlifting, said Ernie Garcia, deputy city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwalk-La Mirada district also has been working to reduce gang activity, 
said Johnna Moore, director of secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
The district has various counseling and drug-and-alcohol-abuse programs at its 
schools. Eighth-grade students, for example, receive some anti-gang instruction 
in a course called "Students and the Law," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal for the Board 
</P>
<P>
Moore said she will present a proposal for new anti-gang programs to the Board 
of Education on June 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been taking a look at everything," Moore said. "If we were where we 
wanted to be, we wouldn't have the (gang) problem." 
</P>
<P>
The city's gang program is part of an overall effort to revitalize Norwalk, 
which has areas of aging housing and a limited tax base, City Administrator 
Richard R. Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has several redevelopment projects under way, including a hotel, 
commercial and residential project just south of City Hall. A consultant also 
has recommended that the city work to establish a modern regional mall and 
office complex to create more jobs and tax dollars for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the city is really at a crossroads in its future," Powers said. 
"I believe that Norwalk, left unattended with gang problems, extensive 
neighborhood deterioration and a weak tax base, could spell a lot of problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to kindle the spirit so the community feels there's hope -- and there 
is. We will deal with these problems, and there is a way to solve them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GANG-RELATED CRIMES 
</P>
<P>
Annual statistics of selected crimes committed by gangs in the sheriff's 
Norwalk station area, which covers Norwalk, Santa Fe Springs, La Mirada and an 
unincorporated county area near Whittier. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department began keeping gang statistics in 1981, when a special anti-gang unit 
started working the Norwalk area.

ROLLER DERBY -- UPDATED AS ROLLERGAMES -- IS BACK WITH A ROCK 'N' ROLL BEAT

<P>
On the heels of the successful union of rock music and professional wrestling 
-- which helped resuscitate the moribund sport and launch a syndicated 
television phenomenon called "Wrestlemania" -- another tired old game is 
putting on the glitz, joining forces with rock 'n' roll and being marketed to 
the MTV generation. 
</P>
<P>
Roller Derby, gasping for life on and off for the past 30 years, will be reborn 
this fall as "RollerGames," a weekly made-for-television extravaganza with a 
music-video look. 
</P>
<P>
And even before the $1-million track is completed and the first elbow jabbed in 
anger, "RollerGames" is skating in the fast lane. Syndicated to 130 stations 
including KTLA Channel 5 in Los Angeles, it will make its national TV debut the 
week of Sept. 13 with a two-hour prime-time special. And while "Roller Derby" 
was usually relegated to Saturday mornings on television, "RollerGames" will 
appear opposite "Saturday Night Live" in 70% of the markets and in prime time 
in the rest, says executive producer David Sams. 
</P>
<P>
Roller Derby's transformation can be likened to Beaver Cleaver joining the cast 
of 
</P>
<P>
"Starlight Express," the high-tech, roller-skating Broadway musical. Roller 
Derby was played in musty arenas on scuffed-up tracks by large women named 
Tuffy and Skinny Minny, but "RollerGames," using what Sams calls "futuristic 
production imagery," is getting a complete make-over. According to an artist's 
rendering, the track will be able to pass for a set from a "Mad Max" film. 
Players are required to look like soap stars and will wear sexy uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Add a heavy metal band at halftime -- Sams says Top 10 acts are "close" to 
being signed -- and you have what the producers hope is a compelling reason for 
teen-agers and young adults to stay home on a Saturday night and root for teams 
with names like Rockers, Hot Flash and Bad Attitude (as parents wonder which 
one of the teams their kid is identifying with). 
</P>
<P>
The show was sold to stations at last January's National Assn. of Television 
Program Executives convention in Houston. There was no video, no pilot, no 
teams, nothing but a glossy promotional packet that featured a beautiful female 
skater on the cover, the artist's vision of the track inside and color photos 
of prototypical teams and players who were described as "cheeky cheesecake and 
handsome hunks." 
</P>
<P>
The packet promised "MTV-style production values . . . network-style in-depth 
sports action coverage . . . a high-speed rock 'n' roller-coaster track . . . 
high-concept teams and merchandisable characters ('players are athletic, young 
and hot -- sex appeal on wheels') . . . and the ultimate, ultra-rad sports 
spectacle and variety show." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sams, the show created a feeding frenzy at the convention. "It was 
the runaway hit by far," says Sams, 30, whose promotional skills helped sell 
"The Oprah Winfrey Show" nationwide when he was vice president for creative 
affairs at King World. "The only time I've seen that kind of action was when 
stations were trying to renew 'Wheel of Fortune' and get 'Oprah.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Sams and his partner, former "Eye on L.A." producer Michael 
Miller, were interested in producing a rock 'n' roller-skating project to "take 
advantage of two forms of TV that had become popular: event television and 
wrestling," Sams says. They took their idea to Motown Productions, with which 
they had a development deal. Burl Hechtman, Motown's vice president of 
television, knew that William Griffiths Sr., who ran Roller Derby, had been 
wanting to put a contemporary spin on his sport and get it back on television. 
A meeting was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
"Within a couple of hours of talking to David, I knew we were all in the same 
place," says Griffiths, whose son Bill Jr. runs the L.A. Thunderbirds, one of 
Roller Derby's best-known teams. At least two other producers had wanted to do 
business with Griffiths, but he thought their conceptual approach was 
"tongue-in-cheek and would have set us back years." 
</P>
<P>
When Griffiths agreed to terms, Sams went to Qintex Entertainment -- the 
Australian conglomerate that recently purchased MGM/UA -- for financing and 
distribution. Qintex, which had the right of first refusal on Sams/Miller 
projects, initially passed on "RollerGames" because of the show's high 
production costs (Sams says each hourlong segment will cost $170,000). But 
after Sams/Miller went out and lined up nearly 20% of the TV stations in the 
country, Qintex changed its mind and bought the project. 
</P>
<P>
In a nondescript warehouse in Sylmar, about a dozen potential players practice 
on a 90-foot-long banked oval made of tempered Masonite glued to plywood. This 
is a far cry from the rock 'n' roller-coaster track under construction in 
Glendale. The finished "concourse" will be a figure-eight with a three-foot ski 
jump and a perpendicular curve ominously named "the wall of death." The 
original design also called for 
</P>
<P>
an alligator pit. An alligator pit? 
</P>
<P>
"That's just hype that the Hollywood boys have been putting out," Griffiths 
says with a wink. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood boys are Sams/Miller and the public relations firm of Bender, 
Goldman &amp; Helper, charged with responsibility for selling the concept to 
the target audience of 18- to 34-year-olds. Griffiths has to temper their 
enthusiasm with the reality of the sport. Despite new terminology (the jammer 
is now the jetter, the pack has become the power guard), the game essentially 
remains the same: four on four, with points scored when the jetter passes 
opposing players. Points also will awarded in "RollerGames" if the jetter 
"survives" the wall of death. 
</P>
<P>
There was no temptation to turn Roller Derby into "Rollerball," the 1975 James 
Caan film in which skaters wearing spiked gloves were pulled around an oval by 
motorcycles. In "RollerGames," the emphasis, like in Roller Derby and pro 
wrestling, will be on melodramatics: "feuds," grudge matches, soap-like 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't lose any of the exciting elements of the old game," Griffiths said. 
"It's just Roller Derby come of age." 
</P>
<P>
A former child dancer in vaudeville who was known as "Sunshine Billy," 
Griffiths, 65, has been involved in Roller Derby since 1960 when he took 
control of the T-Birds. Created in 1935 by a Chicago promoter named Leo Seltzer 
-- who supposedly worked up the rules with Damon Runyon -- Roller Derby was a 
weekly show on the ABC network in the early '50s but had lost its TV contract 
by the time Griffiths got involved. 
</P>
<P>
An advertising executive and promoter, Griffiths began rebuilding Roller Derby 
through television syndication, eventually clearing 147 markets during what he 
calls "our halcyon days." Thanks to TV, box office was also up. In 1972, the 
T-Birds drew 52,000 to Comiskey Park in Chicago. But the good times came to an 
end, Griffiths says, when his TV markets dried up and the Arab oil embargo in 
the mid-'70s made travel too expensive for Roller Derby teams. 
</P>
<P>
For about 10 years, Roller Derby was played mostly in Southern California and 
was carried on a few local TV stations, then was revived again in the mid-'80s 
when Griffiths began trying to update Roller Derby's image. In 1985, ESPN aired 
the game of the week, right after pro wrestling. Although ratings were good 
(630,000 households on a Tuesday night), Griffiths says, he and the cable 
network couldn't come to terms on a contract in '86. 
</P>
<P>
But he still was optimistic that he could bring Roller Derby into the 21st 
Century. "After we decided to go for a sleek, contemporary look, we were an 
accident waiting to happen," Griffiths said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no players have been signed -- and won't be until later this month -- 
"RollerGames" workouts have been going on since April. The roller-skaters 
practice under the supervision of "Little Ralphie" Valladares, the legendary 
player-coach of the T-Birds, who began his Roller Derby career 33 years ago and 
will play this season to become the first player ever to skate competitively in 
five decades. 
</P>
<P>
"See that blonde?" Griffiths says, motioning to a young woman who is staying up 
with the men. "She could barely hobble three weeks ago. Skated like a duck. 
Look at her now. That's what dedication will do." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, "RollerGames" hopefuls need a large amount of dedication because they 
won't receive a paycheck until they sign a contract. Most of them work out five 
or six days a week. When they arrive at the Sylmar track, they must sign a 
waiver that holds RollerGames International harmless if they're injured. 
Players also have to furnish their own skates, which cost upwards of $275. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in so much pain I wanted to cry," says the blonde skater, Kristine 
Van Galder of West Los Angeles. "I've bruised my eye, hurt my head and my knees 
have swollen up." 
</P>
<P>
Van Galder, 21, is an example of the new "RollerGames" look. A few months ago, 
Sams was eating at the Cheesecake Factory in Marina del Rey when he noticed Van 
Galder waiting tables. When he learned that she was a twin -- and that she had 
been in Doublemint commercials with her sister, Jennifer -- he got them a 
skating tryout. In only a few weeks, the sisters have learned enough to be 
"almost sure bets to make the team," Griffiths says. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Galders, who will be attending USC next fall, see "RollerGames" as 
their entree into show business. "I'd rather be doing this than some sleazy 
movie," says Kristine. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the show-biz slant to "RollerGames," Griffiths insists it is a sport. 
And if it's a sport, players don't fall under the jurisdiction of AFTRA, the TV 
union, meaning they don't have to be paid at AFTRA rates, which would be higher 
than the $25,000 annual salary reportedly paid to beginning Roller Derby 
players (Griffiths refuses to say how much he will pay in "RollerGames"). 
</P>
<P>
But Griffiths will get an argument from purists who insist that Roller Derby is 
not a sport. (The Times does not carry Roller Derby results in its sports 
section). Roller Derby, in fact, is often lumped with pro wrestling as far as 
credibility and integrity: It has always been suspected that matches are fixed, 
an allegation that Griffiths largely ignores. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that it is fixed and I don't give a damn, nor do the people who 
tune in," says Griffiths, wearing his trademark fedora. "But I'll say this: It 
is entirely impossible to choreograph a game. And fixing Roller Derby is as 
nearly impossible as fixing the Indianapolis 500." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon in Glendale, about 200 skaters -- responding to a small 
newspaper classified ad -- line up outside the Moonlight Roller-Skating Rink to 
try out for what the ad called "a most dynamic sports league." The scene is 
like Venice Beach on a weekend: women with green hair do wheelies; men with 
Mohawks slalom down San Fernando Road; Frisbee-catching dogs romp in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
This is the "official league tryout," but it is more like a media event. The 
P.R. people from Bender, Goldman &amp; Helper congratulate themselves for the 
presence of nearly a dozen camera crews, including "Entertainment Tonight" and 
"USA Today." Griffiths, in a brown fedora, and Sams, wearing a spiffy tuxedo 
jacket and black bow tie, are interviewed while the massive pack of skaters 
whirls around the rink. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of skaters don't know what "RollerGames" is until they see a blown-up 
rendering of the track in the rink lobby. "All I know is, I want to be on a 
team," says the girl with the green hair, who calls herself Liz "Ard" Tuck and 
says she's from Los Angeles. Does she realize that the action can be rough? 
"Violence is the fun part," she says. "This looks like wrestling on wheels." 
</P>
<P>
Auditioning 200 skaters isn't as hard as it seems. After Sams speaks to the 
skaters and Griffiths speaks to the skaters -- lecturing them on the virtues of 
"desire and dedication" -- Valladares sends 10 at a time around the rink, 
watching for dexterity, showmanship and personality. The audition was 
videotaped for review by Griffiths, who insists that he and his son will pick 
the team, although sources say that the Hollywood boys will try to make sure 
the players meet demographic imperatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had a problem getting players for Roller Derby," says Griffiths, who 
lives in Granada Hills. "They just find us." 
</P>
<P>
The man most responsible for delivering a lot of the promises made in the 
"RollerGames" promotional packet is Chet Forte, the 10-time Emmy winner 
credited with developing the look of "Monday Night Football." Forte has been 
signed to direct the first 13 shows and has an option for the next 13. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be easy capturing everything that happens," says Forte, who 
plans to use six cameras. Problems facing Forte: "RollerGames" is brand new 
(there isn't a book on how to televise it), kinks in the new track will have to 
be ironed out quickly, and a production site hasn't been decided (negotiations 
are under way to erect the set in a building at the Pomona Fairgrounds). 
</P>
<P>
Television, of course, will decide the fate of "RollerGames" -- Sams expects to 
have 175 stations cleared by air time and promises advertisers a 15 rating for 
the two-hour special. But he also expects to make a bundle on merchandising as 
"RollerGames" goes retail. Nintendo is coming out with a "RollerGames" video 
game and Milton Bradley will be manufacturing an electric "RollerGames" game. 
There also will be toys and a soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the TV payoff that's enormous. The World Wrestling Federation Network 
is syndicated on 300 stations worldwide and its recent "Wrestlemania V" was 
seen by 915,000 subscribers on pay-per-view TV and another 400,000 on 
closed-circuit. The potential of "RollerGames," says Sams, "is as big as the 
WWF, if not bigger."

BOB HOSKINS AND A GHOSTLY DENZEL WASHINGTON PLAY 'HEART CONDITION' MOSTLY FOR

<P>
 -- Character of Napoleon Stone, in the film "Heart Condition" 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hoskins enters a tiny, eight-lane bowling alley in downtown Montrose, north 
of Glendale. An electric fan fills the '50s style alley with artificial smoke. 
"Hip Hop Bowl" -- its movie name -- flashes in neon. Black bowlers send balls 
down lanes, scattering pins. Another 50 black extras socialize in the snack 
bar, some holding prop cans of King Cobra malt liquor. 
</P>
<P>
A white assistant director bullhorns instructions to the extras: "Have an 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The snub-nosed Hoskins, playing belligerent Los Angeles detective Jack Moony, 
is confronted by a huge, black proprietor named Bubba -- 340-pound actor Ron 
Taylor -- who makes it clear Moony is anything but welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Moony, the only white guy in the place, flees for his life, pursued 
by a pack of angry patrons and employees. 
</P>
<P>
The scene from New Line Cinema's "Heart Condition," currently shooting in and 
around Los Angeles, is played largely for laughs. But it also clearly plays up 
-- some would say exploits -- black-white distrust and hostility. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, black-white conflict pumps much of the blood into "Heart Condition." 
</P>
<P>
"This scene right now is potentially the most racially offensive," concedes 
writer and first-time feature film director James D. Parriott, who has worked 
extensively in television as a producer and director. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the sequence was set in a bar. Then Parriott -- who is white -- 
considered a church and a black law firm. He settled on the bowling alley 
because it seemed less threatening, "kind of a happening thing." 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I wanted was a cliche(black) bar," adds Parriott during a 
break. "There's enough in this scene that borders on exploitation. This is the 
one scene that I'm the least comfortable with." 
</P>
<P>
In Parriott's script, Moony is a blatantly racist, lower-class cop -- with a 
black superior (Roger Mosley) who won't promote him -- who gets a new lease on 
life from the transplanted heart of a car crash victim. The life-saving organ 
comes from a suave, sophisticated black lawyer -- Napoleon Stone, played by 
Denzel Washington -- whom Moony happens to despise. Caught in the middle is 
high-priced hooker Crystal (actress Chloe Webb) who's been romantically 
involved with both of them. Stone shows up as a ghost, visible only to Moony, 
insisting that he was actually murdered and that Moony bring the villains to 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
It becomes an argumentative but symbiotic partnership -- "The Defiant Ones" 
meets "Topper" -- in which both men bond with mutual respect after much 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
The modestly budgeted production (producer Steve Tisch puts costs at $7 
million-$8 million) is essentially a comedy-action buddy picture with a clever 
twist and a most unusual love triangle. Because it deals with such issues as 
racism, class consciousness and a woman's self-respect in the face of male 
insensitivity -- all in the vein of light entertainment -- casting was crucial 
for a needed touch of class. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to imagine anyone but Hoskins, the charismatic Cockney who shot 
to fame in America in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," somehow making irascible, 
bigoted Moony likable. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch said that such stars as Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, Brian Dennehy and 
Dennis Hopper were among early considerations. "But when Bob's (Hoskins) name 
came up, everybody focused on what a great idea he would be." 
</P>
<P>
With "Heart Condition," Tisch retreads familiar ground: he also produced "Soul 
Man" for New World in 1987, a comedy-drama about a white kid who gets into an 
Ivy League college on a minority scholarship by darkening his skin. The 
$4.5-million film grossed $26 million in North America alone, a solid hit. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch thinks "Heart Condition" might prove less controversial -- and more 
successful -- calling it "lighter (than 'Soul Man'), a lot more of an action 
piece, (with) more production values . . . more of a crowd-pleaser. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I believe that racism -- and this refusal to acknowledge me -- 
arises from (your) feelings of inadequacy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Napoleon Stone to Jack Moony 
</P>
<P>
Virtually everyone interviewed in connection with "Heart Condition" readily 
admits that Denzel Washington wanted changes in Parriott's screenplay, 
specifically regarding racial material. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, that is, except Washington, who emerged as a film star two years ago 
in "Cry Freedom" and who is currently on theater screens in "For Queen and 
Country." 
</P>
<P>
"There were things I felt weren't right (in the script), so they were fixed," 
he says without amplification, and after some prodding, in his trailer. "It was 
rewritten quite a bit, but that's all part of the process." 
</P>
<P>
Parriott is more to the point: "I had some material (in the script) that was 
offensive to Denzel. He said I was going over the top. I'm not a black writer. 
We've got two polemic characters -- the idea is to take a poor, white trash cop 
and put him against a slick black lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
Moony has his racist jokes, Parriott explains, but always gets his comeuppance 
-- including getting decked by the ghost of Napoleon Stone when Moony calls him 
a "spook." 
</P>
<P>
"My one great fear is that they (critics) will find that one mistake (in 
handling the material) and nail me for it. So I'm watching out for it and 
Denzel is helping me. The last thing I want is to be called a racist for this 
film. . . . There have been some 'niggers' omitted that offended Denzel. A 
reference to 'spade' was omitted. But mostly it's subtle stuff, direction on 
how the scene is going to be played." 
</P>
<P>
Washington was particularly concerned that the self-respecting Stone be able to 
react to Moony's racist remarks -- or that the racism be realistically toned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"Denzel had a lot of input about his character and about him as a black actor 
playing Stone, how Stone would be perceived by an audience," Tisch says. "From 
my point of view, all of his questions contributed to a richer character." 
</P>
<P>
In his trailer, Washington proposes that "Heart Condition" is more concerned 
with lack of self-esteem than with racism per se. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the film deals with insecurity -- and racial insecurity is a part of 
it," Washington says. "Moony is insecure, so he strikes out at everybody. Both 
men are very insecure -- Stone about attachment and commitment. He runs around 
with a lot of women, afraid to get close. 
</P>
<P>
"(It's really) a love story -- two guys who didn't know how much they were in 
love with this woman. And they find out. And come to realize that combined as 
one person, they become a better person." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Washington adds, he took the part because of its comedic qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"The script has humor, wit, zaniness -- people haven't seen me in that light," 
said the handsome and imposing actor known for his dignity and solemnity on 
screen. "This is different for me. My friends say I'm crazy saying I have a 
good sense of humor and I'm finally able to show it. But I'm having fun just 
being silly. It's great and it came at exactly the right time. I needed it." 
</P>
<P>
He suddenly leaps up, offering his guest a piece of fresh-baked pecan pie. The 
reporter wonders what the price -- the trade-off -- might be. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no," Washington says, with a deep laugh. "The pen is mightier than the 
pie!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
 It's a white (bleeping) curse. No! It is a black conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jack Moony, lamenting his lot in life 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Washington, Tisch reports, Bob Hoskins didn't question his character or 
the script ("Bob's attitude was, 'Guys, where do I sign, when do we start?' "). 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hoskins himself credits Washington with helping him better understand 
Moony's bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it I didn't understand until I talked with Denzel," says Hoskins, 
beard-stubbled for his role and chain-smoking in a small, stuffy trailer. "I 
thought I understood it, until we started working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Washington, Hoskins said, put Moony's character into perspective as a cop who 
had once had to enforce laws that specifically discriminated against African 
Americans. "The black-white relationship seems to be so important in America," 
Hoskins says. "Not that we don't have racial prejudice in England. But racial 
prejudice was legal here not so long ago. It was part of your system. There's a 
200-year history with blacks a part of it. Not so long ago, this cop (Moony) 
had to enforce the black-white laws. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a total pig, but like all people, he has bad and good. And he has to find 
the good inside." 
</P>
<P>
Hoskins doesn't mind being tabbed as a character actor -- "I'm a short, fat, 
bald middle-aged man with a broken nose. I'm not going to be the next James 
Bond" -- and isn't all that thrilled with the star's burden of carrying a 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather play a cameo -- walk in for two weeks and go home. (Laughing) For 
my regular fee, of course! This kind of stuff (starring roles) is wake up, go 
to work, go to sleep, get up, go to work. I'd like a couple of Jack Nicholson 
roles." 
</P>
<P>
Chloe Webb has said the first weeks of shooting have been hectic -- "I've been 
getting in and out of cars for three weeks" -- and Hoskins concurs. He has the 
usual "bumps and bruises" of action shots, and is a bit worn out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough -- it's a very tight schedule. There's been a lot of running, 
car chases, jumping over things. Give me an armchair!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
 You've got these little boxes that you want to keep people in. You want to 
keep me in the ghetto ... (Crystal) in the house. You gotta stop being scared, 
Moony. You gotta stop being scared that we're all gonna leave you behind.... 
</P>
<P>
 -- Napoleon Stone to Jack Moony 
</P>
<P>
Chloe Webb sits on the sunny steps of a film location off a sloping street 
above Hollywood. Gamine, talkative, bright, funny, she's anything but the 
ill-fated, drug-addicted lover of punk rocker Sid Vicious that she played to 
critical acclaim in "Sid and Nancy." 
</P>
<P>
As Crystal, a hooker trying to find a better life, she's suffocated by the 
possessive Moony, romanced by the slick, unfaithful Stone -- but is not a 
stereotypical movie prostitute, she insists. "She's the emotional hinge of the 
whole piece. There are lots of films where you could cut the girl out 
completely and it wouldn't make any difference. Not Crystal." 
</P>
<P>
The script, she says, "is about something -- different kinds of bigotry. I 
think Denzel's character says it really well, about keeping people in boxes and 
being afraid of them. 
</P>
<P>
"The film makes some really salient points, in an entertaining way." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hoskins is called to the set. The scene requires Moony to trudge up some 
steps to his small apartment, carrying groceries, accompanied by his beloved 
cat, Chuck. As the cameras roll, the chubby Calico trots out ahead, reacting to 
its trainer's signal -- and the promise of a snack. 
</P>
<P>
Hoskins and the trained cat do the scene again -- and again, and again, and 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The star bears it all without complaint -- perhaps it beats leaping in and out 
of cars. 
</P>
<P>
But with a lopsided grin he says, "I'm looking forward to getting to the 
acting."

STEVEN DIETZ: A PLAYWRIGHT, SINK OR SWIM; 
</P>
<P>
HIS 'TEN NOVEMBER' CENTERS ON 1975 SHIP DISAPPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Dietz is rarely without an opinion. He's also rarely without some 
project in hand -- usually writing a play or directing one, very often his own. 
</P>
<P>
Despite about 20 theater pieces to his name, that name still rings few bells 
outside theatrical circles. The blond and boyish 31-year-old, who looks as if 
he's spent the last 10 years racking up innings on some college baseball team, 
has instead spent them forging and staging scripts on the less visible resident 
theater circuit. Sports activity has been confined to friendly softball games 
with fellow playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Dietz also may be remembered as the author of "Foolin' Around 
With Infinity," favorably received at the Los Angeles Theatre Center in 1987. 
On Friday, he returns as author and director of "Ten November," a piece 
inspired by the mysterious sinking of an ore carrier, the Edmund Fitzgerald, on 
Lake Superior in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
His partner in the venture is Eric Peltoniemi, a Finnish songwriter for the 
theater in the Twin Cities who contributed music and lyrics for several songs 
that form the play's key lyrical backdrop. The LATC production will be the 
first one mounted outside the Great Lakes region. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz and Peltoniemi were introduced to each other and commissioned to come up 
with a piece by the Actors Theatre of St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Though the two were happy to work together, they had a devil of a time coming 
up with a project. On the day they needed to deliver an idea for one, Dietz 
heard Gordon Lightfoot's song about the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
"I noted it at the bottom of my legal pad," he said in a recent conversation at 
The Times. "So after we'd talked through all the other possibilities I said, 
'Well, something that seems completely impossible to me, and therefore, 
naturally appealing, is to do something about the sinking of the Edmund 
Fitzgerald.' Eric's eyes lit up and I knew we had something. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out that Eric's from Minnesota's North Shore. I, of course, knew 
nothing. I mean, I'm a landlocked Colorado boy. But it seemed completely 
impossible to try and convey (the idea of) a boat larger than most of downtown 
disappearing in a lake that has 6,000 ships at the bottom of it. So I started 
researching it like mad." 
</P>
<P>
The story of the Fitzgerald is made eerie by the fact that while the boat's 
wreckage was found, they never recovered any of the 29 men who made up its 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
"In the history of Lake Superior, no body has ever washed up on its shores," 
Dietz explained. "They didn't come up with the technology to go to the bottom 
of it until 15 years after they had the technology to go to the moon. I was 
seduced by this at once. My nautical voyeurism took over." 
</P>
<P>
When Dietz had first heard the Lightfoot song, he thought it referred to some 
ancient maritime disaster. "To realize that it happened the week after Squeaky 
Fromme shot at Gerald Ford and when the Pet Rocks were out, placed it in an 
amazing context. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also the most recent tragedy on the Great Lakes. The last 15 minutes of 
the voyage itself, because the ship had lost radio contact, are of necessity 
fiction. We made the decision not to try and impersonate any of these 29 men, 
because we know them only as a group, and they disappeared -- were taken -- as 
a group." 
</P>
<P>
"Ten November" has nine male actors, three female singers and a couple of 
musicians. As the piece developed, the women became increasingly important. 
</P>
<P>
"The play turned out to be more our response to their loss, in terms of the 
music and the singers who function as a sort of environment -- people who not 
only convey the story, but go off on other tangents, regarding loss in general, 
the myth of invincibility." 
</P>
<P>
And there was another resonance: "The Challenger tragedy happened while we were 
writing this. It was a lightning rod." 
</P>
<P>
The Denver-born Dietz lays no claim to an early education in theater, 
describing himself as "a railroader's kid" whose dad was a conductor and 
brakeman on the old Colorado and Southern Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the Bible, the World Book Encyclopedia and a Perry Como record. I saw 
my first theater in high school and didn't have any inkling how to attempt it 
until I went to college (the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley)." 
</P>
<P>
What drew him to the theater? 
</P>
<P>
"Obsessive curiosity. I liked writing -- bad poetry, song lyrics, stuff like 
that. But primarily I was fascinated by people and situations. Piano tuners, 
restaurant critics, chimney sweeps, weather men. I have no interest in writing 
a play in which the architect comes home and makes a martini for his wife." 
</P>
<P>
The morning after graduation, Dietz took off driving randomly around the 
country vaguely thinking he would like to direct plays. He stopped in 
Louisville, Washington, New York -- and Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a friend there," he explained. It was March and when the fan belt on his 
car broke in the middle of a snowstorm, Dietz walked up to an old church to use 
the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a church," he said. "This huge man came up to me when I was 
on the phone and handed me some literature. It was Tom Dunn (of New 
Dramatists). 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'We work on new plays here, we have actors and directors, these are 
our writers.' I drove back to Denver, got my stuff and moved up there." 
</P>
<P>
That was nine years ago. Dietz is now the artistic director of the Midwest 
Playwrights Lab, for which the Playwrights' Center is an umbrella organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a wonderful breeding ground for me and others. It's also my 
touchdown, the place to return to. I'm still in the honeymoon phase with this 
business. There's so much I want to do and it gets worse on planes. That's when 
all the lists start coming out of me, the plays I have to write. 
</P>
<P>
"I got on the map directing new plays, and I was lucky enough to link up with 
writers like John Olive (Dietz directed the premiere of Olive's "The Voice of 
the Prairie"), Kevin Kling and John Klein. I feel a huge responsibility to this 
strange alchemy (known as) making plays in this culture, because it has 
nurtured and enabled me to do my own work." 
</P>
<P>
But what Dietz began to note in the dramaturg-playwright relationship after a 
while was that "for the sake of fairness, passion was being lost. For the sake 
of logic, which has never been the theater's strong suit, amazing voices were 
being rendered quiet or normal or mediocre." 
</P>
<P>
He became a proselytizer for fairer practices. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to respect the notion of mentors, to make stabs at stealing the 
magic of writers you admire early on," he extrapolated. "If you're in 
Minnesota, you write your August Wilson play, your Lee Blessing play, and you 
don't do it as well as they do. It's part of your apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee Blessing plays first base on our softball team. August Wilson used to play 
third base. Now he's never around. I love to tell the story about how, when 
August won the Pulitzer and Lee was the runner-up, everybody wanted to be in 
the infield. It had to be the place to be -- right? 
</P>
<P>
"Finding writers that you admire is an important stage. Beyond that, it's 
important to make yourself the primary mover and shaker of your own work. You 
have to fit into certain niches -- deal with finances, with new play programs 
-- but, ultimately, they don't have to live with what arrives on the page and 
you do. You have to wake up happy with it the next morning. You have to learn 
to fight for it." 
</P>
<P>
One way to do that, Dietz says, is to direct your own plays. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of playwrights can't, certainly," he acknowledged, "but if doing that 
will enable them to carry out what's in their heart, it's something they have 
to try. The medieval notion that playwrights should not direct their own work 
has to, if not be abolished, at least be questioned. I was lucky. I had a 
resume and a background and I had already directed for most of the theaters 
that I had to talk into letting me stage my own plays." 
</P>
<P>
The other alternative, he says, is to work with compatible directors. 
</P>
<P>
"My buddy David Goldstein directed the premiere of 'God's Country' in Seattle 
and it's sort of the same thing with Richard E.T. White (who staged the 
premiere of "Ten November" at Chicago's Wisdom Bridge). They were directors who 
knew another director was in the room. I didn't step on their toes, but they 
respected my input." 
</P>
<P>
Dietz insists that he never directs any of his own pieces early in the process 
without an aggressive dramaturg or assistant director, "someone who's hard on 
me. I want buddies who understand my goals but will hold my feet to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The writers who seem to have been successful are the ones who attempted to do 
a lot. Everyone else is trying to make it smaller -- and I don't mean cast 
size. I mean ideas. The issue gets blurry when it comes to specific agendas. 
All my three- and four-character plays went nowhere. Some of them had up to 15 
staged readings. I began to think of them as the plays that could never be 
memorized. Perennial finalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I started writing 10- and 12-character plays with music and strange 
monologues and facts and -- go figure. Those are the plays I've been making my 
living on. I think that at some point I started going beyond my mentors and 
tried reinventing the theater. I'm not saying any of us are succeeding, but I'm 
drawn to those (of us) who are attempting it. That's our job." 
</P>
<P>
Among those mentors Dietz lists John Guare, Samuel Beckett and "the boys, 
Shepard and Mamet, probably just for the energy of it. As for my frustrated 
journalistic impulses, certainly that mentor is Emily Mann. She was very 
supportive when I worked with her in the Twin Cities. And then I have the 
writers whose work I direct who teach me enormously: Kevin Kling, Jaime Meyer, 
John Klein." 
</P>
<P>
At 31, Dietz has five plays "on the circuit" ("More Fun Than Bowling," "Foolin' 
Around With Infinity," "Ten November," "God's Country," and "Painting It Red"). 
All five are about to be published by Samuel French. "That cracks me up," Dietz 
says with a grin. "It saves a lot of copying." 
</P>
<P>
When not rehearsing "Ten November," he's working on a new piece with Peltoniemi 
called "Happenstance," which opens at Seattle's A Contemporary Theatre this 
summer. And the Denver Center Theatre Company has an eye on "God's Country," 
fittingly a play about the murder of Denver radio announcer Alan Berg by white 
supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
But Minneapolis is home base. "The key thing there is the work," he said, "not 
the hype of the work. It's a springboard in the sense that some of us have had 
our plays done locally and seen them go on to national theaters, but the 
springboard is (contained) within the realm of improving the theatrical art 
form. It's not about dabbling. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an organization in the Playwrights Center that exists solely to allow 
writers to work at their craft. A producing theater can seldom afford the 
luxury to do that on such an ongoing basis. I can finish 'God's Country,' on a 
Wednesday night, make a call and say I need 10 Equity actors Saturday to read 
it and boom -- they're there. I hear it a couple days after it's written with 
some of the best actors in the Twin Cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, at times we might wish for greater visibility," he conceded. "We wrestle 
with that. But there is also the sense that, when you work in theater in the 
Twin Cities you're in it for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
Does film attract him? 
</P>
<P>
"I've been offered some things, which I've sort of turned down. I'm still madly 
in love with the theater and right now it would be foolish of me to not pursue 
it. Film, to me, is like New York productions. If you shoot for it, it's 
unbelievably elusive. You can only do your work. 
</P>
<P>
"And if that sort of gravy gets dumped on your plate later on -- well, that's 
all right too."

SOUND'S UP ON CATALINA; 
</P>
<P>
ONLY 26 MILES ACROSS THE SEA, A SCENIC FESTIVAL SETTLES INTO COMFORTABLE 
CONTRADICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In its third incarnation, the Catalina Festival of Chamber Music has settled 
happily into comfortable contradictions, rejoicing in dichotomies such as 
outdoor chambers and sending its clientele -- and performers -- breathlessly 
scurrying to supremely relaxing concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by the Da Camera Society as the finale to the Chamber Music in 
Historic Sites series this season, the festival last Saturday and Sunday 
crammed in 12 concerts at seven widely dispersed sites, plus assorted 
peripheral events. The spirit of the affair -- a complex gestalt formed from 
the convivial interactions of musicians and audience, sites and sounds -- was 
much too easy-going for true frenzy, but at times it came close. 
</P>
<P>
The festival had little impact on the resort consciousness of Avalon, but among 
the crowds of day-trippers one could spot clusters of chamber music fans, 
identified by black canvas carryalls stamped with the Historic Sites logo and 
much worried consultation of schedules and watches. The plaintive cry of "Is 
there another shuttle?" was the theme song at Island Plaza, the hub of festival 
audience transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most well-organized or speediest of would-be listeners could not get 
to everything, however. Tickets ($12-$50) were available for most events, but 
the schedule forced some hard choices, pitting interesting repertory against 
intriguing venues. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult decision had to be made for Saturday evening, when a strong 
program of music for oboe and/or guitar at the Inn on Mt. Ada went up against 
concerts at two sites new to the festival, the Airport-in-the-Sky and the Zane 
Grey Pueblo Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
For tourists, the remote mountaintop airport offered the lures of a scenic 
journey, plus a preliminary barbecue. The musical payoff, however, was quartets 
by Haydn and Mendelssohn, played by Angeles String Quartet. Considerable 
cheering greeted the Angeles advent last year, but the ensemble spent the 
season diligently overexposing a limited repertory, of which the airport 
offerings were frequently played examples. 
</P>
<P>
That left a recital of Americana at the hotel created from two houses built for 
Zane Grey in 1926, as the concert that best combined unfamiliarity of music and 
place. As a concert hall, the open terrace between the two wings of the hotel 
provided nice views -- plus interruptions from the nearby bell tower twice and 
a resident cat. 
</P>
<P>
Stalwarts of the Da Camera Players battled the distractions, including 
wind-battered music, with unflappable zest. Gary Gray gave a suitably 
sweet-and-sour reading of Leonard Bernstein's Clarinet Sonata, bassoonist 
Kenneth Munday tossed off John Steinmetz's blithely fiendish "Streets of 
Laredo" Etude and a similarly themed, neo-classical Sonata by one Romeo 
Cascarino with plangent aplomb, and David Shostac blew sweetly through 
Copland's Duo for Flute and Piano and the Sonatine, Opus 100, by Dvorak. 
</P>
<P>
Delores Stevens, artistic director of the Players and keyboardist 
extraordinaire, accompanied as accommodatingly as a thinly amplified Yamaha 
electric piano allowed. She turned to an even less tractable instrument for a 
brief and tinny solo turn with John Cage's Suite for Toy Piano. 
</P>
<P>
The festival offered more opportunity for stretching legs than ears. The 
afternoon programs in particular were filled with eine kleine nap-musik, 
affectionately played and received. A repeated program in Bird Park presented 
further engaging woodwind tootling, with real style and zest from Shostac, 
oboist Victoria Tenace, Munday and Stevens in a Trio Sonata by Telemann and 
moody authority from the omnipresent Shostac in Messiaen's "Merle noir," 
interspersed with crisp French Baroque (electronic) harpsichord solos courtesy 
of the equally indispensable Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon at the Inn on Mt. Ada, where the Pacific Rim is not a trendy 
concept but a breathtaking view of sea and rock, plucked strings took 
precedence. The former residence of island mogul William Wrigley Jr. and the 
summer White House for Presidents Harding and Coolidge, the Inn is now an 
ultra-posh -- $440 a night for the deluxe suite, booked far in advance -- 
bed-and-breakfast hotel, and an incomparably gently elegant setting for chamber 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Harpist Amy Shulman matched the elegance with a fluent, varied solo set, and 
accompanied violist Michael Nowak and hornist Paul Stevens in suave 
easy-listening duos. Guitarist James Smith played works by Moreno-Torroba and 
Albeniz caressively, and teamed with Shostac in some of his own irresistible 
arrangements of popular American songs, ranging from "You and the Night and the 
Music" to "I've Got Rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
The most ponderable program had to be that of the Angeles Quartet -- violinists 
Kathleen Lenski and Roger Wilkie, violist Brian Dembow and cellist Stephen 
Erdody -- Sunday at the Avalon Community School. From their season-long 
repertory they offered Bartok's First String Quartet, and with Nowak, played 
Mozart's Quintet in D, K. 593. The day before at the school, Wilkie and Dembow 
played Mozart's Duo in B-flat, K. 424 with mellow grace, on a program further 
distinguished by Gray's urgent, eloquent account of Berg's Four Clarinet Pieces 
and Tenace's piquant elan in Poulenc's Oboe Sonata. 
</P>
<P>
The Avalon Community Church was the scene for the opening concert of the 
festival, presented by Lenski, Dembow, Erdody and Stevens. The church will be 
100 years old in September, and the concert there Sunday was to celebrate that 
centennial, beginning with music from 1889 and ending with the premiere of Mark 
McGurty's "Catalina Cantilena," commissioned for the occasion by Stevens. 
McGurty, however, never finished the composition, according to MaryAnn Bonino, 
director of the Da Camera Society. 
</P>
<P>
There were other holes in the festival schedule. Actor Stuart Whitman was to 
have read some of Zane Grey's fishing stories at the Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel, 
but canceled to attend his son's graduation that weekend. A repeat of one of 
the concerts was also canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cancellations and a thoroughly gloomy Saturday, there was little 
sense of adversity. The final concert of the festival, in the heroically gaudy 
art moderne movie palace of the Casino Theater, proved a celebratory climax, 
and the fittest merging of aural and visual stimuli, the Bird Park 
extravagances notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
There the Angeles Quartet demonstrated some of the virtues of living with a 
limited repertory in a well-thought, finely-spun account of Beethoven's "Harp" 
Quartet (some unevenness in the Presto aside), and the audience of putative 
sophisticates demonstrated the perils of a diet of short works and excerpts by 
clapping between movements, until waved off by Lenski. Festival heroes Shostac, 
Gray and Shulman joined the quartet in Ravel's "Introduction and Allegro," 
Shostac and the strings gave a richly textured reading of Arthur Foote's 
gloriously gooey "Night Piece," and Stevens and her ubiquitous electronic 
keyboard joined the strings in the suite from Milhaud's "Creation du monde." 
</P>
<P>
From there it remained only to seek transportation back to the mainland. The 
physical separation on Catalina, though relatively easily achieved, is one of 
the crucial spiritual elements of the festival. Look for the next one in 1991, 
however. The Da Camera Society is planning other festivals for next season, 
says Bonino, and is thinking of the Catalina Fest now as a biennial event.

Senior leader Deng Xiaoping emerged Friday to praise the Chinese army as a 
"steel Great Wall" for crushing the movement for democracy, and sources said 
that police were arresting intellectuals accused of encouraging the protests. 
</P>
<P>
Military presence was felt throughout the city. Convoys of trucks and foot 
soldiers patrolled by day. More than 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers 
rumbled through the center of Beijing after dark. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry advised embassies to keep staff members indoors at night 
but did not impose a curfew. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democracy Demonstration 
</P>
<P>
In central Shanghai Friday, a day after Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji issued a 
warning that illegal disruptions will no longer be tolerated, about 50,000 
people staged a pro-democracy protest. 
</P>
<P>
Student leaders also demanded that flags on public buildings be flown at 
half-staff to mourn the deaths in Beijing and that a dialogue be established 
between students and Shanghai government officials. There was no word on the 
government's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state television showed soldiers patrolling Chengdu, in the 
southwest, and the ruins of a department store burned by protesters. Police 
were shown making arrests in Wuhan and Harbin, two of the cities where crowds 
burned buses and blocked roads. 
</P>
<P>
A Chinese witness said police, in their pursuit of suspect intellectuals, had 
searched one hotel room by room for a suspect, who was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
"We live now under terror," a student said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quashed Rumors 
</P>
<P>
Deng, 84, quashed rumors that he was seriously ill or out of power by making 
his first public appearance since May 16, when he met with visiting Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening television news, he was shown with other conservative leaders, 
including Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun, posing for a picture 
with senior military officials at Communist Party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The officials stood for a minute of silence in tribute to soldiers who died "in 
putting down a counterrevolutionary rebellion" last weekend, the official news 
agency Xinhua reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Facing a life-threatening situation, our troops never forgot the people, never 
forgot the party, never forgot the country's interest," Deng said, speaking 
forcefully and gesturing for emphasis. "Our troops are worthy of a steel Great 
Wall." 
</P>
<P>
Party chief Zhao Ziyang was absent, as were fellow reformists Hu Qili and Tian 
Jiyun. Reports have said Zhao was stripped of power for opposing the May 20 
declaration of martial law in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic and Western intelligence estimates say about 3,000 people were 
killed when the 27th Army entered the city a week ago Saturday and cleared 
student demonstrators from Tian An Men Square. The government puts the figure 
at 300, most of them soldiers, and has said no one was killed in the square. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the White house said reprisals against protest leaders were 
"repugnant." 
</P>
<P>
"Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of its citizens," 
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers stood at most intersections in Beijing and stopped cars at night to 
demand identification. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds were posted on college campuses, where the protests began in 
mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Order Issued 
</P>
<P>
Martial law authorities issued a new order banning "counterrevolutionary" 
posters and pamphlets, and non-military security forces entered campuses to rip 
down anti-government posters. 
</P>
<P>
One apartment block still bore a huge sign proclaiming: "The students must be 
victorious. Long live the people." But most buildings had government banners 
urging unity against the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador James Lilley said 70 more Americans left Beijing on Friday, 
including his wife. The embassy estimated that 400 Americans remained in the 
city, including 100 embassy employees, down from about 2,500 before martial 
law. Most other foreigners were gone. 
</P>
<P>
There were no confirmed arrests of student leaders or dissidents, but Chinese 
sources reported police taking suspects from homes and a Western diplomat said: 
"We know that they're picking people up all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
The government has announced arrests of dozens of people in Beijing and other 
cities, all accused of attacking soldiers or burning buses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissident at U.S. Embassy 
</P>
<P>
A letter read on television, the writer not identified, said China's best-known 
dissident, Fang Lizhi, was a traitor and should be arrested. Fang and his wife 
took refuge in the U.S. Embassy last week. 
</P>
<P>
Increased patrols indicated a new confidence by the military that citizens 
would not attack. Also, the troops were clearly united after several days in 
which small skirmishes were reported with units opposed to the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers raised the flag over Tian An Men Square, site of the protests, for the 
first time since retaking the 100-acre area from the students early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Television showed a military band playing the national anthem as the red flag 
was raised, and broadcast an aerial view of the square with hundreds of trucks 
and dozens of tanks lined up. 
</P>
<P>
Some buses resumed operations Friday and were allowed to cross the square's 
northern end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debris Cleared Away 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers continued clearing away charred frames of buses, tanks and trucks 
burned by crowds trying to stop the army advance last weekend. Neighborhood 
committees organized teams of residents to help. 
</P>
<P>
Army trucks with loudspeakers drove through the streets proclaiming: "Our task 
is to protect social order . . . . We want your understanding." 
</P>
<P>
In the English-language China Daily, a headline said saboteurs should be 
crushed with "iron fists." 
</P>
<P>
A bicyclist said: "There are plainclothes police everywhere. No one dares to 
talk. I still support the slogans 'Uphold democracy' and 'Oppose official 
corruption,' but now there is no way to express such ideas."

EL SALVADOR ASSASSINS KILL CRISTIANI'S CLOSEST ADVISER

Assassins firing submachine guns from a moving car Friday killed the new 
government's most senior Cabinet minister and two bodyguards as they drove from 
the minister's home, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The armed forces and leaders of the governing right-wing Republican Nationalist 
Alliance blamed leftist guerrillas who have pledged to make the country 
ungovernable. Rebels did not immediately claim responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, 73, who was minister of the presidency and 
President Alfredo Cristiani's closest adviser, died shortly after arriving at 
Zaldivar Hospital, a nurse said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the bodyguards, one of whom was driving the bulletproof 
car, died at the scene. Machinegun fire can penetrate so-called bulletproof 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador William Walker called it "a truly lamentable and senseless 
event." 
</P>
<P>
"I am obviously appalled by this act of mindless terror; shocked that anyone 
would attempt to project their political will by gunning down, in cold 
premeditated blood, a 73-year-old man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The motive "fits the pattern of other recent terrorist attacks and killings," 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Party President Armando Calderon Sol said the minister was ambushed just after 
leaving his home in a western neighborhood of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses, however, said four men traveling in a red vehicle fired in front of 
Rodriguez's house before the car was started. They said they heard five or six 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was the first Cabinet member killed in the nine-year guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
The attack was the first on an official of the party, known as Arena, since 
Cristiani took office June 1. It was the fourth attack on party officials this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas recently offered to halt 
attacks if the new government eliminated death squads. The proposal was 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
Arena was founded in 1981 by cashiered army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson, an Arena 
legislator who has been linked to the squads that killed thousands of suspected 
leftists in the early 1980s. He denies the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Sigifrido Ochoa, another Arena leader, called for action against the 
slayers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confronting brazen terrorism, commanders and communists," he said. "We 
either let ourselves be killed like cowardly rats, or we organize to defend the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon Sol told reporters: "A man who defended law and justice has fallen." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, also a founding member of the party, was a vice minister in the 
1940s, a member of the civilian-military junta in 1961 and foreign minister in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
His assassination came on the third day of a new guerrilla campaign. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, rebels bombed a gasoline station in the capital and attacked 
troops in central and eastern El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The day before, they attacked nine military posts and the army said 21 rebels 
and three soldiers died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cristiani Initiative Rejected 
</P>
<P>
The intensified fighting follows the guerrillas' rejection of Cristiani's 
proposal for dialogue. An estimated 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been 
killed in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Chile, a former air force officer who allegedly led a death squad 
that killed more than a dozen opponents of the military government was 
assassinated Friday outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
The assassination came as President Augusto Pinochet proposed an amnesty for 
people accused of human rights violations after the September, 1973, coup that 
brought the strong-arm general to power. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said Roberto Fuentes Morrison died instantly after being hit 
several times by automatic gunfire from five assailants who fled the scene in a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes Morrison was accused in 1984 by an air force deserter of directing the 
"Joint Command," a death squad that took part in widespread oppression against 
the left during 1975 and 1976.

Aerial infrared surveillance showed hazardous wastes being illegally burned at 
the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, according to an FBI affidavit unsealed 
Friday in last week's federal raid on the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit also accused Rocky Flats operators of illegally discharging 
pollutants into a creek on plant property and of unpermitted dumping of 
hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Hilbert Schauer unsealed the affidavit after a newspaper 
challenged withholding of the information that led Schauer to issue a search 
warrant for the raid Tuesday on the plant, which is located 16 miles northwest 
of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The 116-page affidavit catalogues the allegations made by FBI agent Jon Lipsky 
and indicates that the investigation into possible criminal violations of 
hazardous waste laws will probe activities at the nuclear weapons plant going 
back to November, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Flats is operated by Rockwell International Corp. for the Department of 
Energy. The plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit also questions the DOE's decision to award an $8.6-million bonus 
to Rockwell for excellent management of Rocky Flats. 
</P>
<P>
The Rocky Mountain News reported in Friday's editions that the General 
Accounting Office also has launched an investigation of performance bonuses 
awarded Rocky Flats' managers. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO investigation was the third blow sustained by the facility last week. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 75 FBI and Environmental Protection Agency agents raided Rocky 
Flats in an operation dubbed "Operation Desert Glow." On Wednesday, the 
Colorado Department of Health announced it had found 25 environmental 
violations at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit revealed that the FBI conducted aerial infrared surveillance at 
the plant on three nights in December to determine whether the incinerator in a 
plutonium reprocessing building that was closed for safety violations was being 
illegally operated. They found that it was. Building 771 had been closed by DOE 
inspectors in October. It reopened in January. 
</P>
<P>
The DOE closed the building after a warning sign outside the building was 
accidentally covered up, and three DOE inspectors walked in without proper 
protective garb. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit also said that there was probable cause to believe Rockwell and 
DOE officials in November, 1985, falsely certified that Rocky Flats was in 
compliance with all applicable ground water monitoring requirements under the 
1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, various Rockwell and DOE officials were aware of serious 
contamination and were informed that the monitoring system was deficient and 
did not comply with the RCRA," the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions Arise on Bonus 
</P>
<P>
Also questioned in the affidavit was an $8.6-million bonus awarded Rockwell by 
DOE in May, 1987. It said that DOE gave Rocky Flats' health and safety programs 
and its waste-handling high marks. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, other DOE findings had said that "Rockwell had 
significant problems controlling radioactive contamination at the plant and 
that Rockwell provided DOE with erroneous and incomplete reports on 
environmental, health and safety matters." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sankey, a DOE spokeswoman in Washington, said agency officials had not 
had time to study the affidavit and had no comment. She also said she was 
unaware of the GAO investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone messages left for Dennis Hurtt, Rockwell's spokesman in Denver, were 
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents continued their on-site inquiry at the plant Friday. The 
investigation is expected to last at least through this week, said Bob Pence, 
agent in charge of the Colorado FBI office. The Justice Department is 
investigating whether hazardous waste was illegally disposed of at the plant 
and the actions then covered up. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO investigation of the bonus program at Rocky Flats and other weapons 
plant is expected to be completed in about two months, said Carl Bannerman, 
assistant director of the GAO's energy division in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, which is the investigative arm of Congress, is expected to send 
investigators to the plant later this month, after the on-scene Justice 
Department probe is completed, Bannerman said.

PROSPECT OF NBA, NHL IN S.D. STILL UNCERTAIN; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION FROM OTHER CITIES, LACK OF ARENA ARE PART OF OBSTACLES FACING 
MILLIONAIRE COOPER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early this year, a little-known La Jolla multimillionaire named H. G. (Harry) 
Cooper seized the attention of the financial, political and sports communities 
of San Diego with the public announcement of his vision: a 22,900-seat, 
$120-million, privately funded sports palace that soon would lure the National 
Basketball Assn. and the National Hockey League here. 
</P>
<P>
In the four months since the announcement, the NHL and, to a lesser extent, the 
NBA have taken stock of his moves. Cooper's people have been studying the 
written and unwritten rules for expansion or relocation of franchises in the 
two leagues. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's chances of getting a professional hockey or basketball team are 
uncertain at best. Though there appears to be a slim possibility of landing an 
NHL franchise, the NBA seems a far less likely prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had Harry Cooper's kind of money, I'd retire and live happily," said Vin 
Ciruzzi, president of the Sports Arena and a supporter of Cooper's efforts. 
"But, if his plans don't go through, it won't be because he didn't try." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Relations Disaster 
</P>
<P>
Ciruzzi has spent five years trying to repair the public relations disaster 
caused by Sports Arena tenant wars and the loss to Los Angeles of the NBA's 
Clippers on May 15, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He met with the NHL's Board of Governors last December and visited privately 
with John Ziegler, the league's president. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was set up by Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall, who would love 
to see an NHL franchise in San Diego. It would cut down the travel grind for 
his players and create an instant geographical rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"The NHL in San Diego has good potential," McNall said. "But there are a lot of 
factors involved. A lot will depend on the strength of the offer. The one thing 
the league does not want to do is expand into a city that may be a problem 
area." 
</P>
<P>
At its April meetings, Ziegler announced plans for expansion. He didn't say 
when or where or how many teams the 21-franchise NHL figures to add. But the 
smart money says the league will add either three or four when its Board of 
Governors meets this December. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things the board is waiting to review is a report from the NHL's 
Franchise and Market Analysis Committee, of which McNall is a member. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Cities Lead the Pack 
</P>
<P>
At least nine cities have expressed interest in obtaining an expansion 
franchise. Milwaukee and Hamilton, Ont., are well ahead of a second tier of 
cities -- including San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle -- in the 
battle for expansion grants. 
</P>
<P>
Even more than Hamilton, Milwaukee has everything going for it: an on-line new 
arena, local ownership, lots of money and, in point man Lloyd Pettit, a guy 
with longtime NHL contacts. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, San Diego's arena is still a blueprint. Its ownership hasn't been 
identified, though Cooper says a group led by "somebody with semi-deep pockets 
who we all know in San Diego" will step forth in the next 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
An NHL expansion franchise in San Diego would almost certainly have to play its 
first year or two in the existing, less-desirable Sports Arena, which seats 
13,600 for hockey. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL's average attendance was up to 87% of capacity this year, from the 
1987-1988 season, when its average of 14,425 per game represented 86% of 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
A remote alternative is convincing an existing NHL franchise to move to San 
Diego. But, says Jerry Helper, the league's director of information: "We have 
made every effort to dissuade people from relocating. Only under the direst of 
circumstances do we want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticized Arena 
</P>
<P>
When Cooper, 56, first announced plans to simultaneously buy the Sports Arena 
lease and set about finding a site for his "palace" -- which would be designed 
by architect Gino Rossetti and patterned after the Palace in Auburn Hills, 
Mich., where the Detroit Pistons play -- he denigrated the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"This might sound silly," Cooper said in February, "but it doesn't have a 
winning feel to it. You could move a successful team like the Lakers into that 
place, and the next year they'd be losers." 
</P>
<P>
That statement didn't sit well with the local politicians Cooper was apparently 
bypassing in his one-man crusade to bring more professional sports to San 
Diego. Nor was it encouraging to the dogged Ciruzzi, who had spent five years 
trying to eradicate animosities left behind by predecessor Peter Graham and 
Clipper owner Donald Sterling, who moved the NBA from here to the Los Angeles 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
By last week, Cooper had done an about-face. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"If you walk through the Sports Arena," he said, "it's clean. It's more than 
just fresh paint. Three million dollars in the past three years have been put 
into that place." 
</P>
<P>
But moments later he was talking about the dangers of owning the company that 
runs the Sports Arena in the infant years of the hoped-for NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Just Buying a Lease 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dealing with a company (San Diego Entertainment Inc., which owned the 
Sports Arena lease) that has had a history of people having trouble that have 
dealt with it. So I've been very cautious about it. You're buying a company 
that can have gorillas behind every door. It's not like you're just buying that 
lease." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper says that, once San Diego gains an NHL franchise, it will be the green 
light investors need to break ground for his sports palace. Then, it's just a 
matter of time. The Pistons were playing in Auburn Hills 26 months after ground 
was broken there. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a good chance of a hockey team playing in the Sports Arena by 
1991," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, that's optimistic, but there have been hints that it is 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper recently brought former Montreal Coach Scotty Bowman into San Diego as a 
consultant. Bowman, the winningest coach in NHL history, professed to be 
impressed with Cooper and his business partner, Richard Esquinas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Secret Formula 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize they had a master plan here," Bowman told the San Diego 
Tribune. "And, from what I've seen, it's going to be very tough for the league 
to turn them down. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't give them a secret formula, but if they're aggressive, and they're 
dedicated, they'll succeed. From what I've seen, this group really wants an NHL 
franchise and will go to any end to get one." 
</P>
<P>
The history of professional hockey in San Diego is strong. From 1966 to 1979, 
three teams -- the Mariners of the World Hockey Assn., the Gulls of the Western 
Hockey League and the Hawks of the Pacific Hockey League -- all thrived by 
sub-NHL standards. Average attendance ranged from 5,500 to 8,000. What failed 
were the leagues in which the teams played, not the local support for the 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Ciruzzi says many of the NHL people he has talked to remember how well San 
Diego supported minor league hockey. One is Jim Rutherford, a former NHL goalie 
and now director of hockey operations for Compuware, a Detroit-based computer 
software company. Compuware's publicly expressed desire is to own an NHL 
franchise. The company is waiting to see where the NHL expands before it swoops 
in and makes any purchase offers. 
</P>
<P>
But, Rutherford told The Times, "If San Diego was one of those cities, we'd 
definitely be interested." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ciruzzi: "He who comes up with the biggest bucks is going to get the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
The late Ray Kroc owned the Mariners for a short time. But he got out when the 
team was caught in the escalating salary war between the NHL and the WHA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Travel Schedule 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Ron Ingram, who coached both the Mariners and the Hawks, said, "If Ray 
Kroc had kept the team, I think San Diego would be in the NHL right now." 
</P>
<P>
Esquinas, 33, sees new reasons why the NHL belongs in San Diego. He cites what 
Wayne Gretzky has done for the Kings and hockey in the United States. He points 
to a Kings travel schedule that is 50 tougher "than for other teams." 
</P>
<P>
"They (the NHL) owe Bruce (McNall) an expansion team" in Southern California, 
Esquinas said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said that more than 600,000 former Canadian residents live in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"But winning is the key," said Brad Buetow, former hockey coach at United 
States International University and now coach at Colorado College. USIU last 
year folded its program, which had been making great strides at the NCAA 
Division I level, because of budget problems, the same day Buetow announced his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego doesn't have a hockey tradition," he said. "But it's a great sports 
town." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Announcement Alienated Some 
</P>
<P>
It's also a town where the sports establishment has been firmly in place for a 
long time. And that's why the sudden flurry caused by Cooper's surprise 
announcement alienated certain members of that establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with the way Cooper started," local sports promoter Irv Grossman 
said at the time. "You don't call a press conference, turn on a flashlight, 
then go out and begin gathering information. You get the facts first." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cooper: "We didn't intend to make that kind of splash. I didn't know that 
us buying the Sports Arena (lease) would be news." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't design the splash," Esquinas said. "We just wanted to make an 
announcement." 
</P>
<P>
"We understand now we have to be a little more quiet about all this, and that 
we have to have substance to it," Cooper said. "We threw it out and made it 
look like it was a little premature." 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing premature about Cooper's decision to found General Computing 
in 1965. He sold the company at a huge profit several years later. It is a 
corporation that today boasts annual sales of more than $840 million. 
</P>
<P>
Esquinas, a 1978 graduate of Ohio State University who has worked in the 
direct-mail marketing industry, is Cooper's partner (33%) in the arena venture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Regrets 
</P>
<P>
"We don't regret anything we did," Esquinas said. "But now we're walking a 
little more cautious. We're trying to be a little more methodical and 
thorough." 
</P>
<P>
The NHL and potential investors are watching closely. 
</P>
<P>
"The investors want to know if there is support from the mayor, the City 
Council and the local sports associations," Ciruzzi said. "If not, why should 
they put their money at risk? 
</P>
<P>
"The city has to show it wants a franchise. How do you think the league people 
react when they read that city won't support it? That the press won't support 
it? We've just got to get ourselves in a positive mind set. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting down to the Cooper organization and the city working together," 
Ciruzzi said. "Without those seats (the new arena) in escrow, the NHL and the 
NBA will look askance at their proposal. The crucial thing for both leagues 
will be the commitment that the new arena is coming on line." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody has to budge first. Cooper says ground breaking will start once San 
Diego gets a franchise. Ciruzzi says the NHL and the NBA want ground broken 
before committing themselves to a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Control Sought 
</P>
<P>
Much will depend on the financing, the organization and the reputation of the 
leader of the local hockey group Cooper insists is about to surface. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't want to be the deep-pocket owner even though he's pretty 
deep-pocket," Cooper said. "But he wants to see a team here, and he's willing 
to head it up. He's also willing to turn it over to anyone else that steps up 
that would like to take majority ownership." 
</P>
<P>
Could that mean Compuware? 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to keep as much of the ownership local as possible," Cooper said. 
"Whether or not we accomplish that is another thing. Local ownership keeps the 
community involved and the team rooted." 
</P>
<P>
Local ownership, say most NHL experts, will also have to be prepared to lose $5 
million a year for the first five years. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper hates to hear that kind of talk. He is a gentle man who speaks in the 
easy rhythms of his native Mississippi. And he recently implored a reporter to 
accentuate the positive things he's trying to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not an Avid Sports Fan 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, by December we will have presented to the NHL a very strong story 
about San Diego," Esquinas said. "And hopefully we will have the financing in 
order for the team and the story about the financing and plans for the arena to 
take to the NHL. You've got to have an arena that's as nice as many and nicer 
than a lot of the NHL houses across the league." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper is not particularly athletic or an especially avid sports fan. He has 
lived quietly in La Jolla since the early '70s. But he has come out of 
semi-retirement for this project. 
</P>
<P>
He finds himself going to meetings early in the morning for the first time in 
years. And he says he is perfectly willing to accommodate the city's wishes for 
a downtown arena if that's what the city wants. Originally he wanted it on a 
38-acre tract he owns in Sorrento Valley's Golden Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go where the energy is," he said. "This (San Diego) is home for me."

INFANT ORGAN DONATION STILL A MEDICAL, MORAL QUANDARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIA DUNN, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Gabriel Bailey Holc is a big name for a little boy, but it honors those 
who gave him a big gift -- life. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Holc was known to the world simply as Baby Paul when he was born 1 1/2 
years ago with an underdeveloped heart that was replaced by Dr. Leonard Bailey 
with the walnut-sized heart of Baby Gabriel, born with virtually no brain. 
</P>
<P>
"To leave such a legacy . . . you can't be anything but proud. To know there's 
another little child alive even though there's no hope for your own child. I 
swell up I just feel so good," said Karen Schouten, whose daughter was named 
after the archangel Gabriel, the herald of good news. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, too, is proud of being part of Paul's life. "I feel he's touched down 
in all of our lives in different kinds of ways. . . . There's no dark side to 
this story that I can perceive." 
</P>
<P>
Others do see a dark side, however. And because of the controversy surrounding 
the use of the doomed, anencephalic infants as organ donors, Paul's transplant 
was the last. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts contend that the babies should be used because they will die 
within days and many infant organs are needed. Critics say keeping them on 
respirators just for their organs is inhumane and a frightening precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Schouten and Alice Holc have never met or even talked to one another, but 
the two mothers react similarly in the face of such condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me because I understand you can't please everybody all the 
time. There's always a group of people who are going to disagree and want to 
play the devil's advocate on any issue," Holc said from her home near 
Vancouver, British Columbia. "What bothers me is when a group of ethicists . . 
. delve into it and they don't really seem to know all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't even know what an anencephalic baby looks like." 
</P>
<P>
There is no hope for these infants who are born dying. And there can be no 
mistake, doctors say, in identifying them. 
</P>
<P>
Victims of anencephaly are born with a brain stem, which controls breathing and 
neurological reflexes, but no cerebral hemispheres and only a partial skull. 
Because there is brain-stem activity, they are not brain dead, legally a 
necessary condition before organs can be removed for transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
Anencephaly is believed to result from failure of the neural tube to fuse in 
the uppermost portion of the brain during the first month of pregnancy. Like 
other neural tube defects, the overall incidence is decreasing, mainly because 
of prenatal diagnosis that often leads to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
About half the 1,000 to 2,000 anencephalic babies born each year in the United 
States are stillborn, said Dr. Muin Khoury of the Centers for Disease Control's 
birth defects branch. The rest die within a few days or a week at most and so 
receive only "comfort care" -- food, water and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Without life-support systems, their hearts and livers deteriorate because of 
insufficient oxygen and are useless for transplantation. Kidneys, though 
damaged, still might be viable. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 243 children under age 5 were awaiting organs in early May, 24 of 
them under age 1, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which 
administers the National Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. 
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that as many as half of those under age 2 die waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, you cannot find baby donors because children routinely don't 
die under the circumstances of brain death. You don't get a child who goes out 
on Friday night, has a few beers and gets in a car accident," said Brian 
Broznick, executive director of the Pittsburgh Transplant Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage prompted Bailey, of Loma Linda University Medical Center, to 
transplant a baboon heart into a 12-day-old girl known as Baby Fae in 1984. She 
died 20 days later amid public uproar. The operation was never repeated. 
</P>
<P>
Experts disagree on whether anencephalic babies feel pain and whether 
artificially prolonging life might pressure parents into continuing a pregnancy 
solely for organ donation. Critics fear who else could become targets. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you start defining one set of human beings as being somehow less human 
than the rest of us, where the heck are you going to draw the line?" asked 
Leslie Bond, associate editor of the National Right to Life News. 
</P>
<P>
Jen Molnar of Cincinnati, whose anencephalic son, Jeremy, lived three days in 
1985, also worries about this "slippery slope." 
</P>
<P>
"That respirator serves no purpose for that child to live. The only purpose it 
serves is to promote them as an organ farm," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion of anencephalics as organ donors has gotten so bound up in 
philosophical notions that we've kind of lost the central focus, that is, 
salvaging organs," Bailey said. "We certainly can't salvage anencephalics . . . 
We're very likely to structure the use of the salvage of organs in such a way 
that all the other baggage isn't of vital concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as being such a huge issue that human beings can't come to 
grips with it in realistic terms and pragmatic terms in ways that would enrich 
us as a society." 
</P>
<P>
Loma Linda had no official policy on anencephalic newborns when Alice Holc 
learned in 1987 that the left ventricle of her baby's heart was underdeveloped, 
a condition that would kill him soon after birth. In an unprecedented move, the 
unborn child was placed on a transplant waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Schouten and her husband, Fred, of Barrie, Ontario, had approached 
Canadian doctors about donating the organs of their unborn daughter, diagnosed 
in the womb as anencephalic. "We wanted to have some good come from this," 
Schouten explained. 
</P>
<P>
Paul, born by Caesarean section, was just three hours old on Oct. 16, 1987, 
when Bailey's surgical team made him the world's youngest organ recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Schouten died two months later of a heart attack at age 36, and his wife 
said donating Gabriel's heart "gives me the ability to smile when I think about 
her and him, instead of cry." 
</P>
<P>
Also in December, 1987, Loma Linda established a procedure for accepting 
anencephalic infants as prospective organ donors. The babies would be placed on 
respirators for up to seven days awaiting cessation of brain stem function. 
</P>
<P>
The California medical center's program was established at the urging of many 
parents of anencephalic infants, most notably Brenda and Michael Winner of 
Arcadia, Calif., who were determined to share their unborn daughter's organs. 
</P>
<P>
But Jarren Winner was stillborn on Dec. 22, 1987, dashing their hopes. She was 
cremated and her ashes placed in a silver urn decorated with turquoise, her 
birthstone. The urn is prominently displayed on a living room shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very proud of her. From the neck down, she was perfect," said Brenda 
Winner, 33, who is writing a book titled "Ten Perfect Fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Above the neck, though, Jarren was fatally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go right above the forehead and saw off the back of her head, that's 
what it looks like," Winner said. "It was all open. It looked like liver in a 
butcher market . . . with the brain stem protruding." 
</P>
<P>
Loma Linda suspended its program last July after only two of 12 babies met 
brain-death standards. Neither became a donor, one because the organs were no 
longer viable and the other because no suitable recipient was found. 
</P>
<P>
"Twelve infants were sufficient to show us this is not a feasible technique or 
solution" to the infant-organ shortage, said Dr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda's 
chief of neonatology. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Hospital of Western Ontario, where Gabriel was born, put its program 
on hold in March. Two of the next three respirator-sustained infants were not 
brain dead within the required week. A 5-day-old girl's liver was sent to the 
United States but the recipient needed another transplant, said Dr. Timothy 
Frewen, director of pediatric critical care. 
</P>
<P>
With such a low incidence of brain death, Frewen and other doctors wonder if 
the issue is worth pursuing. The Canadian Pediatric Society plans to make a 
recommendation at its annual meeting this month. A task force of five U.S. 
medical societies expects to publish a report this year. 
</P>
<P>
The United Network for Organ Sharing's directors in February declined to impose 
a moratorium, but adopted a policy discouraging use of anencephalic organs, at 
least until further study. 
</P>
<P>
"Society and the medical profession to some extent have learned following Baby 
Gabriel's experience," Frewen said. "Without accumulating experience, one can't 
say one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, 80 anencephalic infants have been accepted as prospective donors 
since the 1960s, said Dr. David Stumpf, professor of pediatrics and neurology 
at Northwestern University and coordinator of the U.S. task force. Forty-one 
became donors, providing 37 kidneys, two livers and three hearts; transplants 
were successful in 11 kidney cases and one heart case, Paul's. 
</P>
<P>
Of six such kidney transplants at Children's Hospital Medical Center in 
Cincinnati, only one recipient still has the original anencephalic organs, said 
Dr. Paul McEnery, head of the kidney-transplant program. 
</P>
<P>
That patient, Brian Bourgraf, now 25 and an assistant credit manager for a 
Wilmington, Ohio, hardware manufacturer, received new kidneys in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"If that person was here, as he's looking down, he's probably saying, 'I'm glad 
I did it,"' he said. "His parents are more than glad, because they've seen 
what's come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Bourgraf frequently is cited by supporters of proposed Ohio legislation to 
establish a brain-death category solely for anencephalic infants that is based 
on their ability to breathe without life-support systems. Similar measures have 
been considered in New Jersey and California. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University 
of Minnesota, suspects "a significant number" of parents would donate their 
anencephalic babies' organs if they could. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Schouten agrees. "When you see a little baby like Paul it makes it all 
worthwhile."

COOPER NEEDS INFLUENCE WITH NBA AND SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Feb. 8, 1984, the Portland Trail Blazers beat the San Diego Clippers, 
114-105, before a tiny crowd of 4,268 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the hapless Clippers to 16-33. And when a fan saw Donald 
Sterling, the team's owner, heading for the exit, he bellowed at him. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Sterling!" the fan yelled. "You're a bozo!" 
</P>
<P>
According to one newspaper account, Sterling "seemed momentarily wounded." 
</P>
<P>
But, the report said, Sterling recovered in time to say, "I think he meant it 
affectionately." 
</P>
<P>
Three and a half months later, Sterling moved the Clippers to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Millionaire With a Mission 
</P>
<P>
It has been more than five years since the National Basketball Assn. left San 
Diego. And it may be five years or more before it returns, if ever. But if 
Harry Cooper -- a La Jolla multimillionaire with a mission -- has anything to 
say about it, the NBA will be back by 1992 to play in a 22,900-seat 
multipurpose entertainment palace he plans to build with the help of private 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's biggest problem is that he doesn't have much in the way of influence 
with either the NBA or the city of San Diego. He's trying to change that. 
</P>
<P>
But the city has been mostly indifferent to Cooper's building plans. And the 
NBA will have expanded from 23 to 27 teams in two years with the addition of 
Minnesota and Orlando next fall. 
</P>
<P>
At its Board of Governors meeting April 25, the NBA's owners voted not to 
consider any more growth. "Our league has absolutely no plans whatsoever for 
expansion," said Brian McIntyre, an NBA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Cooper the option of convincing an existing team to move to San 
Diego, where the NBA has tried and failed twice. 
</P>
<P>
All it takes is a simple majority of the league's 27 owners to approve a move. 
But the league is enjoying unprecedented attendance success. And few teams 
would even think about moving, much less to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Rubber Stamp' 
</P>
<P>
"We would have to review plans to relocate very seriously," McIntyre said. 
"You're not dealing with just a team or a franchise. You're looking at a 
community. It's not just a rubber stamp." 
</P>
<P>
Many people inside the NBA say the league's commissioner, David Stern, is much 
more interested in placing a team in Orange County because of its ideal 
demographics. Anaheim recently offered Orange County $8 million for the land to 
build an $85-million sports arena in that city, on a site previously proposed 
for a jail. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and his partner, Richard Esquinas, insist that San Diego's potential as 
an NBA market has changed dramatically in the five years since Sterling moved 
the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the NBA realizes there was poor ownership here before, and that 
dictated the flow of fan support, business support and community support," 
Esquinas said. "The citizens of San Diego don't want to be held liable for 
their (Sterling's) errors." 
</P>
<P>
Pleaded Cooper: "Don't hold us responsible for the mistakes they made." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Cooper also says he is a friend of Sterling's. And he says Sterling is the 
most likely candidate among NBA franchise owners to either relocate or sell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Place for NBA in San Diego 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Sterling has taken every recent opportunity to emphasize that he 
is not moving or selling the Clippers. But he does think there's a place for 
the NBA in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no stigma on San Diego in the eyes of the rest of the league," he 
said. "This is a business. What happened five or 10 years ago doesn't matter. A 
lot of people have bad feelings about San Diego. They don't understand what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Whitsitt, president of the Seattle Supersonics, agrees. "The knee-jerk 
reaction is to say there is a stigma in San Diego. I don't think so. The NBA is 
different than it was five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
(The Supersonics are having trouble negotiating a new lease in Seattle, and the 
team's owners looked briefly into acquiring the Sports Arena lease before it 
was purchased by Cooper.) 
</P>
<P>
It was 18 years ago that the Rockets left San Diego for Houston. The 
now-defunct American Basketball Assn.'s Conquistadores (later renamed the 
Sails) folded with a 3-8 record early in the 1975-76 season, their third year. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers arrived in 1978 and actually won four more games than they lost 
that season. But they did not make the playoffs, and they failed to finish any 
higher than fifth in their division in their five remaining seasons here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle With Arena 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem with the Clippers and their community image was an ongoing 
battle between the team and Peter Graham, the man who ran the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Clippers complained that Coach Jim Lynam couldn't be 
heard by his players at halftime because of toilets being flushed upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Responded Sports Arena official Larry Patton: "Looking at the attendance 
figures, there weren't enough people at Clipper games to make that much noise 
flushing the toilets." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers also complained about a leaky roof, an inadequate locker room, a 
faulty basketball floor, a poor sound system and lousy maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and Esquinas figure they will get a National Hockey League franchise in 
San Diego before they get an NBA team. Their hope is to show the NBA the 
success of hockey and the community enthusiasm for their proposed arena once it 
gets built. 
</P>
<P>
"The NBA wants to see a unified front in San Diego," Esquinas said. "More or 
less, they are still waiting to see it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mystery Bankroller 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has enlisted the aid of San Diego's own Bill Walton, the former UCLA 
All-American and All-NBA center for the Portland Trail Blazers. Walton now 
lives in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
And, Cooper said, "we've got a person who wants to bring a team here. He wants 
to be an owner, and his bankers have assured us he's got the money." 
</P>
<P>
Like the prospective NHL owner Cooper says he has waiting in the wings, he 
chooses not to provide a name. 
</P>
<P>
But it's clear that Cooper and Esquinas aren't convinced that Sterling wouldn't 
sell the Clippers for the right price. 
</P>
<P>
Said Esquinas: "I think there's some sentiment in the league that they kind of 
messed up by letting Don get away with that. And I think (bringing the team 
back to San Diego) would be kind of a way of patching it up."

'60S GURU REMAINS A FUGITIVE IN SLAYING CASE 
</P>

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police officers removed a steamer trunk from the apartment of Philadelphia's 
star flower child 10 years ago, and the world created by the so-called 
"Unicorn" began to wither. 
</P>
<P>
The trunk contained the remains of Helen Maddux, a blonde former cheerleader 
known as Holly, Ira Einhorn's lover. 
</P>
<P>
She had been missing for 18 months by the time private investigators hired by 
her family in Tyler, Tex., pieced together enough information to point an 
accusing finger at Einhorn, until then a living symbol of nonviolence with 
incredible personal charm and a nimble intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Unicorn is a fugitive from justice and faces a murder trial if he is 
ever caught. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was Corporate Consultant 
</P>
<P>
Einhorn was a '60s hippie guru of drugs and free love who rode the tide of 
peace and unity to acceptance as a corporate guru-consultant in the '70s. 
People looked to Einhorn for guidance as the New Age dawned. He became a 
Harvard fellow and an environmental leader as he and the times matured, 
although he still dressed as a campus radical, right down to the ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very engaging person," recalled Thacher Longstreth, former president 
of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and now a city councilman. "I have 
nothing but respect for what he was, or seemed to be." 
</P>
<P>
An investigative journalist who chronicled Einhorn's case in a recent book said 
the Unicorn was both the product and property of Philadelphia. The City of 
Brotherly Love nurtured him and worshiped him. It was also his stage, and 
Einhorn was the ringmaster, New York City's Steven Levy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Einhorn was a founder of the Free University at the University of Pennsylvania 
in 1964, organizer of the city's first Be-In in 1967, first Smoke-In in 1969, 
Earth Day in 1970 and Sun Day in 1978. He was an expert in the paranormal and 
spoke at meetings around the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Body Partly Mummified 
</P>
<P>
But the battered and partly mummified body in the steamer trunk, along with 
some startling disclosures by Levy, led investigators and, finally, even his 
close supporters to conclude that there was a grim, hidden side to the Unicorn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," Longstreth said, because here was a man who held in his power 
the magic of the mythical creature whose name he used as his own. The Unicorn 
focused the attention of the nation on himself, on the environment and on 
Philadelphia when he organized the city's Earth Day observance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was truly wonderful," Longstreth said, recalling the day on which thousands 
gathered to honor the sanctity of Earth and mankind in Philadelphia and other 
cities. The premier event was in Philadelphia, on Independence Mall near the 
Liberty Bell. The Unicorn presided as the television cameras zoomed in to show 
him kissing Sen. Edmund S. Muskie full on the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Levy said the Unicorn was more than just a nickname. It was an ideal for 
Einhorn. 
</P>
<P>
"Since someone had pointed out how his name (Einhorn -- One Horn) relates to 
the mythical horse-like creature with a single horn between the eyes, Ira had 
fancied himself as kin to that mythical creature, representing purity, 
uniqueness, gentleness and sexual power," Levy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office and police think he still has some of his old 
magic left because he is still free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He's a Brutal Killer' 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, he's still able to get the confidence of some people, especially 
women, it seems," said Terry Williamson, a spokesman for the district 
attorney's office. "But he's a brutal killer as far as we're concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Einhorn was arrested on March 28, 1979, and charged with the murder of Maddux. 
The arrest shared the headlines with another big event that day, the nation's 
worst commercial nuclear accident, at Three Mile Island power plant in 
Middletown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that he was innocent and said it was a CIA-KGB frame-up. He was 
able to get the services of a top attorney of the time, Arlen Specter, now a 
U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no evidence of a frame and, in January, 1981, when free on bail, 
the Unicorn skipped. His trial was to have begun in February or March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grew Up in Philadelphia 
</P>
<P>
Einhorn grew up in Philadelphia's Jewish neighborhoods, attended the University 
of Pennsylvania and was among the many caught up in the activism of the Vietnam 
era. Levy grew up within a mile of Einhorn and attended the same high school 
where Einhorn studied and played football. There was a chance meeting when Levy 
was working on the underground newspaper known as the Drummer. 
</P>
<P>
Those memories prompted his decision to research and write "The Unicorn's 
Secret," which was published in October. 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered well that Ira was the big presence in Philadelphia," Levy said. 
"He stood for nonviolence, and it seemed unreal for him to be charged with 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't set out to prove guilt or innocence. I just wanted to find out what 
the real story was." 
</P>
<P>
There was the story everyone knew. 
</P>
<P>
Here was a man fluent in science, literature and hippiedom who had built a 
worldwide network of intellectuals from all walks of life. He was the prophet 
of new concepts, which he found in books, articles and his own brain and 
disseminated around the world to those in his network. Bell Telephone of 
Pennsylvania even paid the postage and listed him as a company consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a communicator," he told the Philadelphia Daily News in 1975. "I dig up 
facts and data and convey them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Two Faults 
</P>
<P>
Longstreth says Einhorn had only two faults. 
</P>
<P>
One was body odor. Another was simply his own motion. 
</P>
<P>
"He was erratic," Longstreth said. "He pushed his bad ideas as hard as he 
pushed his good ones." 
</P>
<P>
Levy's digging uncovered another Einhorn, who could hide things from nearly 
anyone, even his network of intellectuals and supporters, nearly to the end of 
his reign. 
</P>
<P>
His network was still somewhat intact when he fled, first to Ireland, because 
it has no extradition treaty with the United States, according to law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, he assumed the name Ben Moore. 
</P>
<P>
One of those who helped finance his exile was Barbara Bronfman, ex-wife of an 
heir to the Seagram's fortune, Swedish authorities told the Philadelphia 
Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
Bronfman read Levy's book and decided to cooperate with the Philadelphia 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson said he could not disclose how much cooperation there might have 
been or the extent of the investigation over the years, but he added: "I can 
say that he's definitely always been a high-profile fugitive for us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fugitive Tipped Off 
</P>
<P>
In December, Interpol conveyed a tip to Swedish authorities that Einhorn was in 
Stockholm. But Bronfman's boyfriend tipped off Einhorn, and authorities found 
only empty rooms, the Inquirer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The book definitely turned the heat on, and a few people have also contacted 
us," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Unicorn's Secret" is about how, in 1972, the Unicorn met the former 
cheerleader from Texas, then a graduate of Bryn Mawr, and how such a man could 
wind up as her murderer while fooling those around him. 
</P>
<P>
Levy discovered a stormy relationship during which Maddux tried repeatedly to 
shed Einhorn's overpowering influence. But her own insecurities kept pushing 
her back. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in September, 1978, she dropped out of sight. Einhorn said he knew 
nothing other than that she had left the apartment to go shopping and never 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
At first, that seemed plausible, and police considered Maddux a missing person 
who wanted to be missing. But Fred and Elizabeth Maddux had not liked their 
daughter's companion and hired a retired FBI agent to find out what happened. 
The retired agent turned to other retired agents for help. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Built by Investigators 
</P>
<P>
Levy's book follows the case as it was built against Einhorn by the private 
investigators, including reports by residents of the apartment house who told 
of a terrible smell. One man even remembered a scream. 
</P>
<P>
Levy found that Einhorn had asked two women for help in disposing of the trunk. 
He had told them it was full of "Russian papers" he had to get rid of. He 
wanted to dump it in the Schuylkill River. But the trunk wouldn't fit in their 
car, Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he turned up two women who had been attached to Einhorn in the 
past. One relationship ended when Einhorn choked the woman, nearly killing her. 
The other ended when Einhorn smashed a bottle over the woman's head. 
</P>
<P>
According to Levy, only one question remained: 
</P>
<P>
"How could a smart guy like him deny that trunk in his apartment?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blames Drug 
</P>
<P>
Levy concluded that the answer was a drug, ketamine, which wouldn't cause 
brutal behavior but would allow Einhorn to dissociate himself from it.

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN BURIAL GROUND IS 'MISUNDERSTOOD AND MISNAMED' 
</P>

VALLEY OF THE QUEENS, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This quiet, bone-dry ravine of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the 
Valley of the Kings just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery. 
</P>
<P>
And with the mystery, its name. 
</P>
<P>
Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the Place of Beauty. To the Arabs it 
was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and guidebooks perpetuate the homage to 
entombed royal women: the Valley of the Queens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by all 
Egyptologists," said Christian LeBlanc, field director for a continuing 17-year 
French-Egyptian project to record and study its history. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be calling it the Valley of the Royal Children. They were here 
first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and named by tradition 
rather than history." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hillsides Scoured 
</P>
<P>
Season after archeological season, LeBlanc's team has scoured the sloping, 
dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find the origins of a sequence 
of burials that would last almost 2,000 years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as 
late as the Christian era when Pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over 
and crosses painted on. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of ancient Egypt's 
18th Dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a period of decline, Pharaohs 
and their kin once again lived and died like kings. 
</P>
<P>
That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the 19th Dynasty, 
changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said it is unclear why he did or why the practice continued. In 
addition to queens, royal children still were buried here, and concubines who 
cared for them and Pharaohs' mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings in some of the tombs show Hathor, the goddess of women and love, 
emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. LeBlanc said perhaps this 
indicates that religion brought the ancients here, because Hathor's realm also 
included the cemeteries on what is called the West Bank across the Nile from 
present-day Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treasure-Filled Tombs 
</P>
<P>
The 18th Dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began, was a time when 
queens traditionally shared their Pharaoh's tombs in the Valley of the Kings. 
Many of ancient Egypt's greatest rulers were buried there, along with the young 
Pharaoh Tutankhamun, whose treasure-filled tomb was discovered by Howard Carter 
in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the Kings. Hundreds 
of other royals and officials also were buried on the West Bank. But to the 
world, the glory of the Pharaohs meant the Valley of the Kings -- not the 
Valley of the Queens, the Valley of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles. 
</P>
<P>
For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an afterthought, a place 
to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit to the Valley of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found in the 
limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were working 
tomb-by-tomb," LeBlanc said. "Today, we've uncovered all the major tombs and 
have returned the valley to the way it would have looked when burials began. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we can write its history." 
</P>
<P>
As LeBlanc talked, he and Fathy Hassanein, director of the Egyptian Antiquities 
Organization's National Documentation Center, walked through scores of 
excavators digging toward the valley's bedrock. The job at hand was almost 
done, another tomb uncovered from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for 
most of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restoration Work 
</P>
<P>
An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that more can be 
opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now. 
</P>
<P>
The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers of Ramses II's 
powerful queen Nefertari, is among those so deteriorated that they remain 
off-limits. More than half its paintings of the elaborately dressed and 
coiffured queen have been destroyed by natural forces. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said one source for the valley's history has been tidbits left by 
workers who built and decorated the tombs. For generations they lived in a 
village inside the valley. Their records, on papyrus, provided the team not 
only with answers but with mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis Nefret, one of Ramses 
II's many wives, and a queen named Duat-Iny-Pet. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said they might have been same person, but "where are they?" 
</P>
<P>
He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of the queens' 
mummies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is strange," he said. "Did those who came afterwards destroy them?" He 
added that it could mean another royal cache exists, perhaps mummies of queens 
and children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mummified Fetus 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the tales LeBlanc has faced in rewriting a new history for the 
valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the tomb of 9-year-old prince 
Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of Ramses III. 
</P>
<P>
Local guides tell fascinated visitors that Ramses' queen became so distraught 
over the death of their son that she miscarried and the mummies of both 
Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed. 
</P>
<P>
The story is nonsense, LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
Early this century, the Italian excavator Ernesto Schiaparelli found the fetus 
in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens. It was Schiaparelli, not 
ancient priests, who placed it inside the prince's empty sarcophagus. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction that it has its 
own tiny case.

WEST GERMAN COUPLE RENOUNCE CITIZENSHIP, FORGE NEW LIFE UNDER COMMUNISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GIRARD C. STEICHEN, Associated Press 
</P>

<P>
ORANIENBURG, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, Werner and Ingeborg Kuenz renounced their West German 
citizenship, packed their belongings into the family Mercedes-Benz and headed 
for a new life in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The decision stunned friends and relatives who could not comprehend why they 
would both give up well-paying jobs and a comfortable home to move to one of 
the most rigidly controlled societies in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relatives told us we were crazy," Werner Kuenz said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could believe that anyone would voluntarily go to a country that 
thousands of people are trying desperately to get out of." 
</P>
<P>
Kuenz, who is 50 years old, said he and his wife decided to move because they 
had inherited property from his wife's aunt, who lived just outside 
Oranienburg, about 30 miles northwest of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Enterprise 
</P>
<P>
The two-story, stucco house the couple inherited contained a modest restaurant, 
bar and dance hall. The couple have been operating The Anchor restaurant as a 
private enterprise for two years now. 
</P>
<P>
Small, heavily regulated private enterprises are tolerated by East Germany's 
communist authorities on a limited scale. 
</P>
<P>
Kuenz said he and his wife had planned the move for several years. As the 
departure date of July 1, 1986, approached, Kuenz quit his job as a painter and 
his wife gave up her position as a sales clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked until the day before we left," Kuenz said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our decision to move was based on personal, not political, considerations," 
said Ingeborg Kuenz, 49, who grew up outside Oranienburg with her aunt until 
she left East Germany illegally in 1956 to join her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I always considered this place my home." 
</P>
<P>
But the Kuenzes acknowledge that they have risked much for an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't be able to stand it if we couldn't leave for visits," Werner Kuenz 
said, referring to East Germany's strict limits on travel to the West. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, all of our requests have been granted." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attends Class Reunion 
</P>
<P>
He said he was allowed to go to his class reunion in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little trouble with that one at first because it isn't included in 
the government travel categories." 
</P>
<P>
He said the family's trips to the West depend on the good will of the 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Kuenz said the family also had to get used to living in a society where 
consumer goods are sometimes scarce or difficult to get on short notice. 
</P>
<P>
"But we get by pretty well," Ingeborg Kuenz said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the couple's 10-year-old son Udo had also adapted well to their new 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Werner Kuenz said it took a while for their East German neighbors to adjust to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Renovated 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in 1986, the couple set to work renovating the house and the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"People here aren't used to seeing people invest the amount of time and energy 
into work," he said. "They don't put that kind of a day in down at the people's 
diner." 
</P>
<P>
Now nearly finished, the establishment's colorful table settings, potted plants 
and cheerful atmosphere set it apart from the drab state-run restaurants down 
the cobbled road toward town. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind seeing a little free market economy around here," Kuenz said, 
referring to the strict price guidelines he is required by the state to charge. 
</P>
<P>
Kuenz admits that to keep the menu tasty, the family sometimes has to dash to 
the hard currency "Intershop" store in East Berlin for ketchup, spices and 
other essentials. 
</P>
<P>
Kuenz said customers continue to visit the bar just to ask why the family had 
turned its back on a Western life style many East Germans would eagerly 
embrace. 
</P>
<P>
"No one really comprehends it," Kuenz said, shrugging his shoulders.

A 5-week-old baby living with her family at a local shelter for the homeless 
has died of head injuries, and police suspect that two 4-year-olds are 
responsible for the death. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Franklin died last weekend, but police did not release details of the 
incident until after receiving an autopsy report that classified the death as a 
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
The chief state medical examiner's office determined that the infant died of 
severe head injuries. There were also bruises and bite marks on the body. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah and her twin were left alone on a bed in their second-floor room at St. 
Luke's Community Services family shelter while their mother, Suzette Franklin, 
went downstairs to sterilize a bottle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor entered the Franklin room and found Sarah lying on the floor, police 
said. The baby's mother thought she had locked the door when she left, but one 
of the 4-year-olds suspected in the case showed police how to open the locked 
door. 
</P>
<P>
The unrelated 4-year-old girl and boy suspected in the case lived near the 
Franklin room, police said. They have not been identified and will not be 
charged with any crime because of their age, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Chief John Perrotta said the two children did not intend to kill 
the baby, although police still have not put together the events leading up to 
the death.

BLOCKADE RUNNERS CARRY VITAL FOOD, AMMUNITION TO BESIEGED LEBANON CHRISTIANS

OQAIBEH, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most nights, a dozen small cargo ships zigzag through shelling for ports along 
Lebanon's Mediterranean coast to deliver food and ammunition to Christians 
besieged by Syria and its Muslim allies. 
</P>
<P>
Others dart in during daylight, often as shells and rockets explode around them 
and knots of people stand on shore and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
The ships' cargoes have become the lifeline for the estimated 1 million 
Christians trapped in their enclave north of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"This is why there are no serious shortages," said a police spokesman, who 
cannot be identified under standing regulations. "The ships bring in 
vegetables, canned fruit and cattle as well as ammunition." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the provisions are essentials. An East Beirut businessman said one 
company recently received 11 containers of whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said at least 12 ships a day make it through the Syrian 
blockade. They dock mainly at Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut, and the 
ancient port of Jubayl, 10 miles farther north, and at smaller harbors in 
between. 
</P>
<P>
Christian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two or three ships 
out of every 15 carry weapons and ammunition from Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival 
and the Christians' only ally in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war began on March 
8 when Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun ordered his troops, most of whom are 
Christians, to blockade ports run by Muslim militias. Fierce artillery battles 
followed and the Syrians blockaded Christian ports. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a cease-fire called by the Arab League on May 11, the Syrians shell the 
Christians' coastal strip daily to try to prevent supplies from reaching Aoun's 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the Syrians have deployed navy gunboats to tighten the 
blockade, and some cargo ships have been turned back. 
</P>
<P>
But some Christians believe the Syrians are not tightening the noose as much as 
they might. 
</P>
<P>
"With the firepower the Syrians have they could be doing a lot more," one 
source said. "We don't know why there is this restraint, except possibly 
because they're not yet prepared to go all the way." 
</P>
<P>
The danger zone is about six miles off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Boutros Sassine, 23, was a crewman aboard the 1,000-ton Lebanese freighter 
Paula, which took several hits on May 18 as it approached Oqaibeh, five miles 
north of Jounieh, with a cargo of food. 
</P>
<P>
He and three other crewmen were wounded when a Syrian 130-millimeter shell hit 
the mast. 
</P>
<P>
Lying in St. George's Hospital in East Beirut, his head heavily bandaged, 
Boutros said the freighter was about five miles off Oqaibeh "when the shells 
started falling all around us." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them were hitting only a few feet away, sending cascades of water over 
us. Then we were hit. I saw my brother Boulos and the others fall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A fishing boat which was in the vicinity came through the shelling and took us 
ashore," Boutros said. 
</P>
<P>
A Christian source said that most of the ship captains come from the Oqaibeh 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"Their agency pays them about $5,000 a trip," he said. "The seamen who used to 
earn $200 a month now get $200 a trip, which usually lasts between 24 and 48 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
The ships sail mainly between the Christian enclave and Cyprus, 100 miles to 
the northeast. But Christian sources reported that some also pick up cargoes of 
fruit and vegetables from the southern ports of Sidon and Tyre, both run by 
Muslim militias. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman in Sidon said merchants charter boats to take produce to the 
Christian enclave. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to waste their produce," he said. "They're ready to sell to 
the devil."

DISNEY POOH-POOHS BEAR STATUE PLANS

A Canadian town that claims to be the birthplace of Winnie the Pooh wants to 
erect a giant statue of the famous bear, but Walt Disney studios will not 
permit it. 
</P>
<P>
"Winnie the Pooh is a Canadian," said Tom Bagdon, president of the Chamber of 
Commerce in White River, Ontario, about 50 miles north of Lake Superior. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand why Disney gave us such an abrupt answer. We feel they 
have a movie and a half here in the true story of Winnie." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Born Near White River 
</P>
<P>
Bagdon explained in a telephone interview that the bear on whom British writer 
A. A. Milne based his children's stories and whose copyright Walt Disney Co. 
now holds was born near White River in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Colebourn, a veterinarian with the Second Canadian Infantry Brigade, 
bought young Pooh from a trapper for $17 when he was passing through White 
River on a troop train. 
</P>
<P>
Colebourn, an Englishman who had settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba, named the 
1-foot-tall cub after his adopted city, and the troops nicknamed her Winnie. 
The young American black bear sailed with the soldiers to England and became 
the mascot of the brigade. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a great morale booster for the troops," said Colebourn's son Fred, 64, 
in a telephone interview from Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
He said his father left the tame bear at the London Zoo only after a commanding 
officer decided that Winnie could not go to the front lines in France. 
</P>
<P>
At the zoo, Milne and his son, Christopher Robin, spotted the bear who now 
figures so prominently in children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
"You could pat her like a dog. The kids rode on her back," Colebourn said. 
"They never had a bear like her and I don't think they have since." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monumental Plans 
</P>
<P>
He added that Pooh's origins are fully documented in his father's detailed 
diaries and in official papers in the London Zoo archives. 
</P>
<P>
When residents of White River learned there was proof that the well-known bear 
hailed from their town, they made plans to build a 25-foot-high monument to 
Pooh pictured in Milne's books. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to cash in on the bear because they're in a depressed time. They're 
looking for anything to give the economy a boost," said Colebourn. "That's why 
they were so happy to hear about Winnie the Pooh and their connection." 
</P>
<P>
But Disney, based in Burbank, would not go along with the plan. In a letter to 
a lawyer representing White River, the company said such a move would not be in 
line with its "contractual commitments and present and future plans for this 
character." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Disney suggested that White River put up a statue of a regular black 
bear and a plaque explaining the connection to Winnie the Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
Colebourn is hoping to erect a sculpture of his father's bear and a plaque 
commemorating both Winnie and his father in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Bagdon said an ordinary bear statue would not draw tourists to White River and 
town residents will continue to push for Disney's bear. 
</P>
<P>
A statue of Pooh like the one in the books would be "one of the greatest 
attractions across the Trans-Canada highway," he said.

MAYOR HOPES TO CLEAN UP ALABAMA TOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
When Margie Moberg Wilson complained to her husband about poor city services, 
he challenged her to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old real estate agent, mother of five and grandmother of five, now 
is nine months into a term as mayor of her financially ailing hometown, a 
Mobile suburb suffering from nearly two decades of white flight. 
</P>
<P>
Prichard's 38,000 residents -- 78% of them black -- have an average income of 
$12,000 to $15,000. Unemployment is 13.5%, compared with 11.5% a year ago. Its 
800 units of public housing have a waiting list and Wilson Avenue, the main 
street, is lined with boarded-up businesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bring Solutions' 
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to see this city cleaned up," said Wilson, who has urged 
residents to bring solutions, not complaints to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Offsetting her determination is the cold reality of economics. Prichard hasn't 
had a printed budget since 1972, but Jim Longino, the finance director Wilson 
hired, said it will be $488,000 in the red this year. The city has been 
operating without insurance since last year. 
</P>
<P>
"When you ride through downtown Prichard, you see that there is very little if 
any real type of retail or any other services that are generating a taxable 
base that would allow the city to start to grow again," said Floyd Pough, who 
works in a community assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
Whites began moving out with the election of Democrat A. J. Cooper, the first 
of three black mayors, in 1972. As whites moved out, poor blacks from north 
Mobile began moving in. Cooper resigned in 1980, convinced that blacks had 
taken control of "their own destiny," which had been his goal. 
</P>
<P>
The "mass exodus by whites that threw the situation out of balance" still 
continues, said the Rev. J. J. Phillips of Mount Sinai Baptist Church. He said 
the challenge remains poverty and the white flight that took business with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eked Out Victory 
</P>
<P>
"Black people want the same things as whites -- nice homes, good jobs," said 
Wilson, who is white. She eked out a 3,144-3,050 victory over Jesse Norwood, a 
black Democrat, in a runoff election in September after he defeated two-term 
GOP incumbent John Smith. The job pays $35,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Prichard is still Prichard," regardless of who is mayor, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agent Paul Buchman, said Wilson hasn't been in office long enough 
to judge. "She has on one or two occasions mentioned some things, but they are 
in the formative stages and it's difficult to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
It's not possible to counter poverty "until such time as they see some change 
in the neighborhood situation," Buchman said. Many of the residents of a large 
part of the city are on welfare and "most of the households are headed by women 
with children." Employed residents, including the new mayor, tend to live in 
the part of the city known as Eight Mile. 
</P>
<P>
And regardless of who's in City Hall, he said, it must address the areas that 
are "drug infested and have no money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime Blamed 
</P>
<P>
"The inner city is where the problem lies. Inner-city crime, and I don't know 
how we're going to stop that." 
</P>
<P>
Pough lived in Prichard for 27 years, but moved to Mobile in 1980 to buy a 
house that would not decline in value. "Not many people want to live in a city 
where you have a high rate of unemployment, and you're not getting services 
from the city in terms of police protection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His agency can help the poor and homeless in the short term, "but you get 
people who are out saying, 'I need to work. Can you help me?' . . . Once you 
get people who can't find affordable housing, and jobs that will pay them a 
decent salary to get off welfare rolls, to work on a daily basis, they are 
trapped."

DETECTIVE SEES ID BRACELETS AS VITAL IN GIVING AID TO MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT DOGGETT, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Detective Doug Haskin has spent the better part of the decade finding missing 
persons and returning people whose memories are impaired to the those who care 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting behind his desk in the Missing Persons Unit at the Los Angeles Police 
Department headquarters, the burly veteran investigator described a scenario he 
confronts daily. 
</P>
<P>
"It begins like this," he said, leaning forward and taking a long drag on a 
cigarette. "An individual who can't even remember his name walks away from a 
room-and-board facility. He's wandering around the streets. Citizens take him 
in. They call the police. 
</P>
<P>
"Officers get there, but he can't remember who he is or where he lives. The 
officers notify us and then take him to the station. They'll wait there while 
we try to link him to a report of a missing person. The officers wait, but they 
have to get back on the streets. If we can't help, they only have one 
alternative -- take him to a county hospital." 
</P>
<P>
The memory-impaired person may remain at the hospital for days, weeks or even 
months as social workers and detectives try to determine who he is and where he 
lives. Haskins said one man spent nearly four months in a hospital before he 
was returned to his home, just a few blocks from where police picked him up. 
</P>
<P>
For each day that an otherwise healthy person occupies a county hospital bed, 
taxpayers shell out a minimum of $1,000, including the costs of social workers 
and detectives. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Haskin and other detectives wrote up 3,170 missing persons reports. 
Of those, 1,827 -- or 58% -- were for people described as being in poor mental 
health. 
</P>
<P>
"The 58% we wrote reports on -- and that doesn't include the hundreds of others 
who were lost and returned before we had a chance to write a report -- were 
schizos, Alzheimer's disease, coke heads, retarded, people in and out of mental 
hospitals . . . people with poor memories," Haskin said. 
</P>
<P>
Haskin's office walls are covered with photos of John Does and Jane Does, 
police jargon for unidentified men and woman. Some of the Does are dead, their 
photos taken in a morgue. 
</P>
<P>
He envisions a scenario that could make his life, and theirs, a lot simpler. 
</P>
<P>
"Picture this," he said. "A person walks away. A citizen takes him in and calls 
us. He's wearing a Medic Alert bracelet. We ask for the personal identification 
number on the bracelet and send a (police) unit out. As the officers are en 
route, we call Medic Alert and give them the ID number. They put the number 
into a database and come up with the person's name, what medications he's on, 
where he lives, information on who to call in case of emergency -- everything 
we want to know about this person. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time officers arrive and pick him up, we can tell them who they got and 
where he lives. Within minutes he's home and the unit is free to return to the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
Giving memory-impaired people bracelets that can help authorities quickly 
identify them is an idea whose time has come, Haskin said. 
</P>
<P>
And although such a program has not been established in Los Angeles, a similar 
program for Alzheimer's patients has been in operation in San Diego County for 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with it," said Judy Neubauer, director of operations for 
Alzheimer's Family Center. "It's very good for anyone who may lose 
consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego center's director, Joy Glenner, saw a need to do more to help 
lost Alzheimer's patients when she learned police were putting some of them in 
jail after mistaking them for drunks. 
</P>
<P>
Glenner contacted Medic Alert Foundation International, the only 24-hour 
international service providing authorities with crucial information on 
individuals wearing medical-alert bracelets and pendants. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was Medic Alert's creation of Links to Life, a program 
specifically designed to assist authorities with Alzheimer's patients who 
wander off. The start-up cost to each community is $10,000 -- a sum quickly 
repaid by the savings incurred. 
</P>
<P>
The only other costs to the community are the $25 charge for each lifetime 
membership. In San Diego, county supervisors were so taken by the program they 
donated their own money to create a fund to pay the $25 fee for Alzheimer's 
patients who can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to helping officials return a lost Alzheimer's patient," said Rich 
Haggart, director of Medic Alert's Links-to-Life operation, "when a person 
wearing a Medic Alert is rushed to a hospital after collapsing or suffering 
some other emergency, the doctor at the hospital is able to learn from us 
exactly what type of medication the patient's on, who his doctor or doctors 
(are), and who to contact in case of emergency." 
</P>
<P>
"It will have other information as well that may be helpful to the doctor," 
Haggart continued. "If, for example, the patient recently underwent a coronary 
bypass, medical personnel will be warned not to apply cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation directly to the heart because the pressure on his chest would 
kill him." 
</P>
<P>
Haggart says the Links-to-Life program has now been set up in eight communities 
and will begin in Orange County this month. 
</P>
<P>
For Haskin, a strong proponent of bracelets, the sooner they spread to Los 
Angeles the better. 
</P>
<P>
'It begins like this. An individual who can't even remember his name walks away 
from a room-and-board facility. He's wandering around the streets. Citizens 
take him in. They call the police.'

ENCINITAS JOINS THE BATTLE OVER HOW TO BEAT BLIGHT

In the 16 years he has owned a small, 14-unit motel at the northern end of Old 
Highway 101 in Encinitas, Jerry O'Brien says he's seen the coastal business 
strip go from bad to worse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone downhill," laments O'Brien. "The character today in this area is a 
lot of crime, a lot of drugs, a lot of prostitution. Stroll along 101 after 
dark. It's not a healthy environment." 
</P>
<P>
As O'Brien sees it, the private sector has failed to revitalize the area, so 
it's time to turn elsewhere for help. His answer? Redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Just down the street, Robert Brent hardly agrees. 
</P>
<P>
When Brent, a professional artist, got wind more than a year ago that the city 
was hatching plans for a redevelopment agency, he shuddered. He could just see 
his quaint little artist studio being razed to make way for some grandiose 
shopping complex. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials have since agreed to refrain from using such powers to 
seize property if a redevelopment agency is formed, Brent remains unsure 
whether the concept makes much sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think many of the things redevelopment promises are going to 
happen on their own in five years anyway," Brent said. "There's just too much 
of a dynamic in this area for it not to." 
</P>
<P>
It's been fought in city after city across the nation, and now the 
redevelopment battle has come to Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by troubled business owners such as O'Brien, city officials embarked in 
early 1988 on a campaign to form a redevelopment agency and started down the 
road of addressing some of the problems plaguing the newly incorporated city. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the effort has made only minimal headway. A tenacious band of 
merchants and residents concerned that redevelopment could do more harm than 
good to the cultivated beach-town charm of Encinitas have dogged the project 
every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
These critics contend that the recipe for redevelopment seems half-baked at 
best, with all the ingredients for financial disaster, broken promises and 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
No one really denies that some sections of the city need sprucing up, in 
particular the Old Highway 101 corridor through the northwestern quadrant known 
as Leucadia. 
</P>
<P>
That downtrodden strip is spotted mostly by aging storefronts and lined by 
broken-down guardrails that hark back to the days when 101 was the major link 
between San Diego and Los Angeles. Lacking storm drains, the curbs are 
sometimes flooded by standing water, even on sunny days. 
</P>
<P>
Boosters say redevelopment is needed to cure just those sorts of deficiencies. 
They also see a redevelopment agency as a vehicle for rehabilitating 
infrastructure problems throughout the city, to make up for the years of benign 
neglect under county rule that ended with incorporation of Encinitas in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a need for it in so many areas," said Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines, a 
redevelopment supporter. "Redevelopment doesn't mean we're going to tear down 
everything and rebuild. It can simply mean making improvements such as curbs, 
sidewalks and sewers." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as now envisioned, the plan calls for no direct intervention into the 
marketplace with large-scale projects involving assembling land for commercial 
development. Instead, money diverted from local property taxes would go for a 
variety of public improvements: widening and repaving streets, providing 
parking lots, landscaping median strips, building storm drains, lining bike 
paths, putting utilities underground and building community parks. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also say funds could be made available for commercial 
rehabilitation loans, low-income housing assistance, improved beach access and 
anti-erosion efforts along the coast, public library expansion and perhaps even 
construction of a new civic center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ambitious Boundaries 
</P>
<P>
To do that, officials have etched out an ambitious set of redevelopment-area 
boundaries that zigzag across the city -- encompassing most of the major 
commercial thoroughfares and the residential neighborhoods that straddle them, 
including El Camino Real, Encinitas Boulevard and Santa Fe Drive. 
</P>
<P>
By providing plush, landscaped streets and efficient traffic systems, 
redevelopment can act as a catalyst for private renewal of areas such as Old 
Highway 101 in Leucadia and ensure continued success elsewhere in the city, 
according to Carlos Flores, a city management analyst shepherding the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere along the line, Encinitas is going to have to face up to the 
economic realities of life," said Harold Hakken, chairman of the eight-member 
redevelopment project area committee. "Basically, we have problems that need to 
be corrected in our community. The city by itself would find it very, very 
difficult without the taxing advantages of redevelopment to be able to tackle 
these blight and infrastructure problems." 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment has been hammered by criticism, however, ever since the council 
voted in February, 1988, to go forward with the effort. At first, opponents 
focused most of their attention on the eminent domain issue, raising the 
specter that private homes and businesses would be bulldozed to make way for 
large shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
The council defused that issue in March, voting to prohibit the agency from 
using condemnation powers. Since then, however, critics have continued to blast 
redevelopment at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
Although a final decision by the council on redevelopment was expected this 
month, critics on the project-area committee managed to block any chance of a 
vote until later in the year, meaning the city will miss out on garnering tax 
revenues from the coming 1990 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Some redevelopment boosters contend that the nay-sayers are mostly former 
opponents of incorporation who are opposed not so much to redevelopment as to 
the fact that it is being pushed by incorporation standard-bearers such as 
Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if their objection is to redevelopment as much as it is to 
anything this council would do," Hakken said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say such claims are ridiculous and divert attention from the real 
issue: What's wrong with redevelopment. And they see plenty that is. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say city officials have glossed over important details and pushed a 
"wish list" of projects instead of hammering out a definitive and realistic 
slate of improvements to be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
They also suggest that the project's ambitious boundaries should be scaled 
back. As now envisioned, they say, the project encompasses several commercial 
and residential zones that hardly qualify as blighted, among them the beehive 
of shopping centers along El Camino Real and ocean bluff-top neighborhoods that 
feature some of the most expensive homes in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What About Later? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they argue that money diverted for redevelopment could erode the 
quality of services provided by other agencies, such as the fire or water 
districts, that depend on a cut of the property-tax pie. 
</P>
<P>
The well-financed redevelopment agency itself, meanwhile, would be in the hands 
of a select handful of bureaucrats, critics say. And who knows what a future 
council would do? Current leaders may not choose to use the power of eminent 
domain to buy a home to create a beach parking lot, but there are few 
guarantees for the future, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some foes grouse that stringent requirements for low-income housing in 
redevelopment areas would only help perpetuate the pockets of poverty that now 
exist, or force the council to adopt tough measures such as a citywide 
rent-control law. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, what the agency has asked for is a blank check," said artist 
Brent, one of the most outspoken critics of the program. "There's too much 
power left to wheel and deal." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of redevelopment, meanwhile, offer a laundry list of arguments 
countering those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Scaling back the project boundaries so they include only commercial streets 
would cut potential revenue from $589 million during the life of the project to 
$229 million. In the meantime, much of the work that has already been 
accomplished, such as financial studies and environmental reviews, would have 
to be redone, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Rich Would Benefit 
</P>
<P>
They also contend that the boundaries are justified. Even pricey neighborhoods 
would benefit from redevelopment projects that take place nearby, supporters 
say, and, although some commercial streets don't appear blighted, they have 
traffic problems that could go uncorrected for years without redevelopment 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say other agencies would not go begging for funds diverted to 
redevelopment, noting that most of these service districts are in negotiation 
with the city to hammer out agreements specifying what percentage of property 
taxes they will get. 
</P>
<P>
Hakken argues that redevelopment is flush with checks and balances that allow 
for public participation and comment as the process unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't a blank check by any means," he said. "If there is a change, it is 
returned for reexamination and renegotiation." 
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Anne Omsted, the participation of property owners in the 
project is strictly voluntary, and eminent domain could be used only to 
complete public projects such as roads, drainage systems and park improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of suffering, she said, property owners would benefit through 
redevelopment from street and drainage improvements without new taxes being 
levied. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city would retain great latitude in providing low- or 
moderate-income housing, officials said. Instead of rent control, the city 
would probably provide rental subsidies or interest-rate reductions for 
prospective home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, for one, would like to see the program get started soon. For months he 
has been trying to get a loan to rebuild and expand his aging motel, but 
lenders refuse to take a chance in his section of town. Redevelopment, he 
figures, would change all that. 
</P>
<P>
"We need this program, we really do," O'Brien said. "You put the spark of 
redevelopment in the area . . . and we'll really see something happen."

TIJUANA VENDORS THRIVE SERVING ILLEGALS ON JOURNEY TO EL NORTE

"Con todo?" Francisca Gutierrez de Garnica asked the hefty man standing on the 
other side of the fence. "With everything?" 
</P>
<P>
It was yet another taco transaction in Tijuana. But this slice of business was 
different, a singular snip of international commerce that embodies the 
entrepreneurial spirit and binational character of the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The fence through which Gutierrez, the taco vendor, handed her tasty rolled 
delicacy was none other than the 10-foot-high barrier separating the United 
States from Mexico. Her client was an undocumented migrant waiting just inside 
U.S. territory in anticipation of nightfall and his trek farther north, into 
the U.S. interior, where, he hoped, a job awaited him. 
</P>
<P>
"Muy sabroso" he said of his quick repast, after having passed his payment of 
1,500 pesos -- about 60 cents -- through the chain-link barrier that separates 
north from south. "Very tasty." 
</P>
<P>
It is international trade at its most basic and fundamental, a microcosm of the 
booming commerce that characterizes the border zone. 
</P>
<P>
As the international boundary line winds for almost 2,000 miles, through harsh 
desert, jagged mountains, semitropical flatlands and fast-growing cities, 
vendors and 
</P>
<P>
other free-lance entrepreneurs are everywhere, trying to make a buck. Operating 
from elaborate stands or with only simple coolers and boxes, the merchants 
peddle items from beer to clothing, from burritos to doughnuts, cigarettes to 
sodas. Other entrepreneurs act as guides and smugglers, while still others lift 
customers across the shallow waters of the Rio Grande or erect home-made 
bridges on the Tijuana River, charging minimal tolls. There is money to be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Following their clients -- the hundreds of thousands of people who travel to 
the international frontier each year trying to enter the United States without 
papers -- the merchants set up shop on each side of the border, often 
crisscrossing the line, and, in the case of several taco vendors in Tijuana, 
often selling through the border fence to those waiting on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Their business rises and falls with the undocumented traffic: Many speak of the 
booming days of 1985-86, before the revision in U.S. immigration laws, when 
there were so many more customers, all potential taco consumers. Alas, many of 
the long-time undocumented border crossers have become legal via the amnesty 
program, and now go back and forth through the legitimate ports of entry, 
bypassing the informal crossing points -- and diverting business from sundry 
border sales persons. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago, I used to sell 6 kilos of meat a day," said Rosario 
Valenzuela de Ortiz, who, with her husband, sells tacos from Mexican territory, 
alongside De Garnica's stand and the hole in the border fence. "Now," said De 
Ortiz, known as la guera, or blondie, because of her hair color, "Now, maybe I 
sell 4 or 5 kilos on a good day." 
</P>
<P>
The drop-off in business, she said, prompted her to switch her principal sales 
item last August from burritos to tacos, as the latter are cheaper and seem to 
sell better. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, they stopped buying the burritos," De Ortiz explained with a 
shrug as she tended an array of tortillas being heated on her charcoal grill, 
where a kettle of boiling water was also perched, ready for hot chocolate and 
instant coffee mixes. Nearby bowls held beans, homemade red chili, chopped 
onions and fresh cilantro, all transported daily by van from the family home a 
few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
De Garnica, who works alongside De Ortiz, has it somewhat easier. Her home is 
just 20 yards from the fence, so she and her children transport everything on 
foot. She began selling food directly from her home, she said, then moved up to 
be closer to the action. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening, near the two international taco stands, Julio, a shy 
10-year-old, was pacing just inside U.S. territory, selling packages of chewing 
gum, individual cigarettes and shots of tequila, the latter dispensed from a 
bottle hidden inside his tattered sweater. Just on the other side of the fence, 
his father sold beer from a cooler, another generational link in the border 
business chain. 
</P>
<P>
"The vendors serve a very specific market," noted Rosio Barajas Escamilla, an 
economist at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a research institution in 
Tijuana. "With the economic situation in Mexico, a lot of the vendors at the 
border probably do a little better economically than the people in regular 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, surveys by El Colegio indicate that full-time vendors at street food 
stands -- even more prevalent in Tijuana than strip shows and bars catering to 
blue-eyed teenie-boppers -- typically earn two to three times the official 
minimum wage of $4 to $5 a day. Mexico's economic crisis has forced many 
wage-earners to seek alternate ways of making a living, and, along the border, 
that sometimes means setting up food stands at popular international crossings, 
be they legal or illegal entry points. 
</P>
<P>
This peculiar borderlands service industry, of course, is dwarfed by the 
multibillion-dollar commerce -- including assembly plants, tourism, the 
import-export of foodstuffs, raw materials and manufactured goods -- that 
dominates the region. But, for the undocumented immigrants, the vendors provide 
amenities and a final touch of home, helping to ease this critical juncture in 
the stressful and sometimes hazardous passage from Latin America into a nation 
many still find bewildering. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait here so long, of course we get hungry," said Jose Martinez, a 
30-year-old native of the Mexican state of Guerrero who was standing just 
inside U.S. territory, not far from several taco stands. "If they weren't 
selling here, we'd have to walk back into Mexico to find food, or not eat 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
And, Martinez noted, there is another concern: Returning to Mexico means the 
risk of being shaken down by Tijuana and Baja California policemen, who are 
notorious for extorting money from migrants. "They take everything you have," 
noted Martinez, who was surrounded by a group of migrants as he spoke. Perched 
on a hill above, uniformed U.S. border guards eyed the group warily. 
</P>
<P>
The taco sales site favored by Francisca de Garnica and Rosario de Ortiz is a 
well-traveled spot perhaps half a mile east of the giant port of entry at San 
Ysidro. The spot is on a windy bluff -- Rosario Ortiz refers to it as Cuatro 
Vientos, or Four Winds -- that affords expansive views of Tijuana, the border 
and, stretching to the west, the Pacific Ocean. Dust in food is a constant 
problem, especially when U.S. Border Patrol vehicles make their frequent 
rounds, kicking up the earth, and, in particular, when the patrol's helicopters 
pay low-flying visits. 
</P>
<P>
While the border can be a dangerous place, the two women said they had 
witnessed little violence in the four years each had spent there vending food. 
A few hundred yards to the south, a cross on the Mexican side marks the spot 
where a man was killed several months ago, residents said, although no one 
seemed to know exactly how that happened. 
</P>
<P>
Being in Mexico provides the vendors with a clear advantage, affording them 
protection from U.S. immigration authorities. Agents frequently patch the holes 
in the border barriers, but their handiwork is quickly undone by resourceful 
border-crossers and their guides and smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Afraid of Police 
</P>
<P>
As for undocumented vendors just inside U.S. territory, Marshall L. Mehlos, 
assistant chief Border Patrol agent, said that authorities usually warn them to 
return to Mexico before taking them into custody. In some popular crossing 
areas, notably the region known in San Diego as the soccer field, or, in 
Tijuana, as Canon Zapata, the vendors have erected quasi-permanent stands and 
exhibit little fear of la migra. 
</P>
<P>
While merchants selling tacos from Mexican territory aren't violating U.S. 
immigration laws, those vending them through the fence are clearly in violation 
of some federal statutes, notably those requiring documentation for merchandise 
sold in international trade. "Nothing should be just passed across the border," 
said Bobbie Cassidy, a senior inspector with the U.S. Customs Service in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Then, noted Cassidy, there are also assorted Department of Agriculture and U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration laws. Not to mention county and city of San Diego 
ordinances regarding sales of foodstuffs. But no one recalls any enforcement of 
such regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, U.S. law enforcement is barely a worry for the border taco 
vendors. They've watched on hundreds of occasions as the vehicles of la migra 
have arrived in clouds of dust, sending their clients scurrying back across the 
fence. Francisca de Garnica, for one, says she has no desire to join the 
legions headed north. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm content here," said Gutierrez, a 42-year-old mother of 8, many of whose 
children work alongside her at the stand and whose husband sells ceramic items 
to tourists at the official crossing point. "We earn enough to live, and we're 
never lacking something to eat."

82 ARRESTED PROTESTING ABORTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
2 CLINICS TARGETED IN NEW STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty-two people were arrested Saturday when hundreds of anti-abortion 
protesters struck two area women's clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The 82 were arrested after refusing to leave a San Diego complex until they 
were forced to do so by police using pain-compliance techniques. There were no 
arrests at a La Mesa clinic, where protesters voluntarily left after 
barricading nurses and patients inside. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations led by Operation Rescue organizers began shortly after dawn 
and marked the first time in the recent series of sit-down protests in San 
Diego County that two women's clinics were targeted at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters at the San Diego offices of Dr. Phillip Rand and Dr. Gilbert S. 
Hardie sat before the front and rear doors, refusing to leave despite police 
warnings that they were violating a federal court order prohibiting such 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forced Into Police Vans 
</P>
<P>
About an hour into the protest, police officers wielding nunchakus applied pain 
to the wrists of about two-thirds of the demonstrators and physically forced 
them into police vans. Three protesters slid under a police van, but officers 
forced them out and arrested them. 
</P>
<P>
The nunchakus, as they have in the past, created the greatest concern among the 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens' Advisory Board on Police/Community Relations is reviewing the use 
of the controversial pain-compliance devices, and several board officials were 
on hand to observe the demonstrations and arrests Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
They saw dozens of protesters rising to 
</P>
<P>
their feet with the nunchakus wrapped tightly around their wrists and heard 
many of their cries and moans throughout the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," said Andrea Skorepa, chairwoman of the review panel. "It looks 
like they (the demonstrators) have a fairly peaceful attitude." 
</P>
<P>
But she was inclined to disagree with protesters' demands that the officers 
pick them up and carry them out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's a viable solution. There's more of a chance of injury, 
for the officers and the demonstrators." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the demonstrators who voluntarily walked into the police vans said they 
suffered severe injuries from past protests. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Forrester of Fallbrook said a bone in his right wrist had been 
broken. "They just snapped it. I could hear it. I felt the crunch, and a guy 
three feet away heard it snap, too." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Scofield, a nurse from Poway, said both her arms and shoulders have been 
injured with sprains and severe nerve damage. One arm was in a sling; the other 
wrapped in a bandage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unnecessary brutal force," she said. "I can't work. My family cooks. My 
daughter cleans the house. I can barely lift up a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Duncan Hunter, (R-Coronado), said in a telephone interview that pain 
should not be inflicted on peaceful demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not for the police to punish people because they plan or orchestrate a 
demonstration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Police Chief Bob Burgreen, in a letter to Hunter, strongly defended the use 
of nunchakus. 
</P>
<P>
"Pain-compliance techniques are neither bizarre nor cruel and rarely result in 
injury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rand and Hardie could not be seen at the Mission Village clinic during the 
protest. But two employees did arrive for work, and they became visibly upset 
when demonstrators noted that they were pregnant and began urging them against 
an abortion. However, the employees never indicated they ever even considered 
an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
And Billi Wheeler, a nurse at the clinic, said abortions aren't even performed 
there. "We don't even have the equipment here to do one. We have nothing to do 
with abortions here. Never have. Ever." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pushed Past Guards 
</P>
<P>
In La Mesa at the Family Planning Associates Medical Group on Fletcher Parkway, 
demonstrators pushed their way past security guards about 9 a.m. and barricaded 
a clinic office, trapping at least two patients and several employees inside 
for almost three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the patients waited outside, concerned for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy, it's sick," said one man, who came to the clinic to pick up his 
sister after an abortion and found the large crowd inside. 
</P>
<P>
"If she'd known this, she wouldn't have come. At least not this morning." 
</P>
<P>
Employees inside the clinic refused to talk to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, after negotiating with La Mesa police and San Diego County 
sheriff's deputies, agreed to peacefully march out of the building at a rate of 
two every minute until the entire complex was cleared. As the 150 demonstrators 
walked out, their colleagues outside, many of whom said they were from Orange 
County, cheered them on. 
</P>
<P>
Also outside were large groups of pro-choice advocates, carrying signs and 
cheering their cause. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very insulting," Joyce Tavrow of Rancho Bernardo said of the 
demonstrators. "They're very frightening."

IT'S TIME TO RESTORE THE VISION OF A DOWNTOWN BAYFRONT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Nolen, a turn-of-the-century urban planner, envisioned bringing San 
Diego's two premier natural attractions, Balboa Park and the sea, into "direct 
and pleasant relation." He suggested parks, gardens, a museum and an aquarium 
at the bay and an inland civic center, all connected to Balboa Park by a 
"suitable" parkway or boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Time passed Nolen's creative idea by. But San Diego City Councilman Ron 
Roberts, an architect by trade, thinks it's time to fulfill Nolen's dream. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts recently called for a 16-acre park at the foot of Broadway, to form a 
ceremonial entrance to the city. The park would have an amphitheater facing the 
bay and would be surrounded by museums on the ground floors of adjacent 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The bayfront park, which Roberts calls Paseo Park, would be "linked" to Balboa 
Park by landscaping along Broadway to the planned civic center at 12th Avenue 
and then up Park Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' plan is just conceptual, and the details will need full debate. But 
overall, it's very promising. Open space is virtually nonexistent downtown. And 
what better place for a downtown park than along the waterfront, which is in 
danger of being walled off with high-rises? 
</P>
<P>
Establishing museum space around the park also makes good sense. It would be an 
intelligent complement to Balboa Park, which cannot accommodate all of the 
museums and cultural institutions vying for space there. A bayfront museum 
complex would also reinforce the link between the park and the water. 
</P>
<P>
But a waterfront park will take a good deal of cooperation among the city, the 
San Diego Unified Port District and the Navy, because the park would occupy 
Navy and Port District land. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Wolfsheimer, chairman of the Board of Port Commissioners, has expressed 
enthusiastic support for the plan. But the Navy has been hesitant. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has plans for a large office-and-hotel complex on its property just 
south of Broadway, and Paseo Park would displace one of the high-rises in its 
plan, costing the Navy millions of dollars it proposes to use to pay for its 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
In deference to Nolen's vision, the Navy plan also includes a park, although it 
would cover only 5 acres. And the Navy has already scaled back its plans once, 
to address city concerns. So its reluctance to endorse Roberts' proposal may be 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts' proposal for a 16-acre park is an improvement on the Navy's plan, 
and we hope that, together, the Navy, the Port District and the city can come 
up with a compromise to help compensate the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
This will take flexibility by all the parties. But the result could be a 
waterfront that the Navy and the city will be proud to call home.

2 KILLED AS HELICOPTER CRASHES ON I-15 MEDIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A helicopter pilot and his passenger were killed Saturday morning when their 
craft struck a high-tension power line and crashed onto the wide center median 
of Interstate 15 near the community of Rainbow, just south of the Riverside 
County line. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, identified as Patrick Mowry, 31, of Valley Center had only 18 hours' 
flight time in a helicopter and was supposed to have been flying solo as part 
of his qualifying for a helicopter pilot's license, said San Diego County 
Deputy Coroner Jack Larkie. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Mowry had taken a friend with him, identified as Michael Powell, 32, 
of nearby Pauma Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were killed instantly when the small helicopter, flown out of Civic 
Helicopters at Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, crashed. It was foggy at the time, 
but authorities are unsure whether the fog contributed to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Larkie said the crash was witnessed by an off-duty Los Angeles police officer, 
who said the craft was flying north and following the freeway when apparently 
the pilot noticed the high-tension wires directly in his path. As he banked to 
the left and tried to fly beneath the wires, the top rotor hit the wire and the 
helicopter plummeted to the ground, Larkie said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries on the ground, though the power lines fell across Old 
Highway 395, now a frontage road to the newer freeway. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at Civic Helicopters declined comment on the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the incident.

REFLECTIONS: 'WHEN WE WENT TO TIAN AN MEN SQUARE, IT WAS CALM AND QUIET. THEN .

Frank Lilley watched Oceanside grow from a cozy beachfront town to a bustling 
city during his record, 18-year stint as city manager there. Now, at 
70-something, Lilley has recently married. He and his bride took a honeymoon to 
China, arriving just as the student protests were beginning. Lilley was 
interviewed at his Oceanside home by Times staff writer Leslie Wolf and 
photographed by Don Bartletti. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I came to Oceanside in 1952 when the population was about 14,000, and now it's 
around 114,000. In the beginning, it was a small town, and it seemed like 
everyone knew everyone else. But it started to grow while I worked there, and 
it has constantly grown ever since. So it's a big city now instead of a sleepy 
little town. It was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps was always out there, and at one time the city encouraged the 
Marines to come into town. The economy depended on it. Down around Hill Street, 
there were many, many businesses that catered to the Marines, and they were 
really welcome. Then, as the town grew, they were not so pleased with having 
all the visitors, especially on weekends. But this city has always considered 
Camp Pendleton an asset, and there was always an ongoing program of keeping 
relations with them as good as we could. 
</P>
<P>
I retired from the Oceanside city manager's job in 1970. I had been there 18 
years, which was probably one year too long, because the last year was kind of 
hectic. 
</P>
<P>
Even though I was retired, I continued to work for the next 10 years, and I got 
a little bit of a reputation as an interim city manager. After I left 
Oceanside, I immediately went to work for San Marcos as city manager for a 
couple of years, then to Imperial Beach, Carlsbad and Vista. I also worked for 
both SDG&amp;E and La Costa as a government consultant. 
</P>
<P>
I'd been living alone for the past six or seven years, and about three months 
ago I got married. Last month, my wife and I took a belated honeymoon in China. 
We were there when all of the student protests were going on. When we went to 
Tian An Men Square, it was calm and quiet. Then the next day we heard there 
were thousands of students demonstrating in the square. 
</P>
<P>
Our tour guide in China was a graduate student. He wants to come to the U. S. 
to get an advanced degree. But his father is a general in the Chinese army, and 
they won't let him out of China to come over here. He was very sympathetic with 
the protesters, but of course his father wasn't. They live in the same house, 
and that caused problems. We don't know if he's dead or alive now. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing all this was quite an experience. It wasn't a fun thing, but it was 
educational. When you're there, you can't help but feel favorably toward the 
students. All they want is a better life, and they're deserving of it. There's 
an awful lot of poverty there and not much opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
There are some tremendous new hotels over there that are just beautiful, very 
luxurious. Then you step out the door and see this incredible poverty in the 
streets. It made us feel very bad. Instead of automobiles over there, there are 
thousands of bicycles. We saw people working in the rice paddies along with the 
water buffaloes, and we saw women hauling carts like horses. 
</P>
<P>
We also stayed in Hong Kong a couple of days. It's a huge city. Here in San 
Diego we have a few skyscrapers, but there are just hundreds of skyscrapers 
there. There was quite a bit of talk there about China taking back Hong Kong in 
the 1990s. Quite a few people now are moving out because the future is very 
unsure.

GARDENA HOSPITAL IS REJECTING MEDI-CAL; 
</P>
<P>
200-BED FACILITY CITES GROWING LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial Hospital of Gardena, joining a growing number of hospitals in Los 
Angeles County, announced Friday that it would no longer accept Medi-Cal 
patients, effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-bed hospital cited Medi-Cal's "cumbersome" procedures and low 
reimbursement rates for its decision to stop treating such patients. The 
hospital by law cannot turn away from its emergency room Medi-Cal recipients 
and indigents without insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losing Money 
</P>
<P>
"We're losing money," hospital spokeswoman Andrea Rowe said. "Our charges are 
more than they are giving us." 
</P>
<P>
John Rodriguez, who oversees Medi-Cal operations for the state Department of 
Health Services, said hospitals have not substantiated their claims that the 
state vastly under pays them under the Medi-Cal system. 
</P>
<P>
He added that despite the decline in the number of hospitals admitting Medi-Cal 
patients, the overall quality of care for such patients has not decreased 
because there is sufficient space at other hospitals to care for all Medi-Cal 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
The Gardena hospital declined to specify how much money it calculates it loses 
treating Medi-Cal patients. Nor would it divulge the number of Medi-Cal 
patients it treats. Such patients are referred to the hospital by physicians 
who practice there. 
</P>
<P>
However, the hospital, in figures recently submitted to state health officials, 
estimated that in the last fiscal year it was paid $2.8 million less for 
Medi-Cal services than it had billed Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
The investor-owned hospital does not hold a contract with the state to provide 
Medi-Cal services. But because there are too few hospitals in its area willing 
to sign such contracts, state officials have deemed the area "open." That means 
Gardena, as well as any hospital in the area, may treat Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years a number of hospitals, citing the same reasons as Gardena, have 
stopped admitting Medi-Cal patients. During the past year alone, eight 
hospitals that held Medi-Cal contracts in Los Angeles County have dropped out 
of the system, according to the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Rodriguez's assertion that patient care has not been affected by 
the decrease, Council spokesman David Langness said: "It's getting harder and 
harder for poor people to find care. They are getting squeezed out of the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Langness said the hospital industry estimates that for each dollar of care a 
hospital provides to a Medi-Cal patient, it is reimbursed 50 cents or less. 
</P>
<P>
Both a county health official and an official at Robert F. Kennedy Medical 
Center in Hawthorne, which holds a Medi-Cal contract, said they could not 
predict what impact Gardena's decision would have on patient volumes at nearby 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate when another hospital decides to be selective or not to meet 
all the needs of its community," Kennedy spokeswoman Suzan Vida said. "It is 
just a greater burden to other health care facilities in the area."

'CALIFORNIA, HERE I COME! WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE BIGGEST SIGN YOU FOLKS HAVE 
EVER SEEN. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT.' -- ROBERT GRUSNICK, AUBURN HILLS 
MAYOR; 
</P>
<P>
VINCENT TO PAY IF LAKERS LOSE THEIR MAGIC TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As if injuries to Magic Johnson and Byron Scott and two straight losses weren't 
enough, there's more bad news for Lakers fans. 
</P>
<P>
A friendly wager between Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and his counterpart in 
the Detroit Pistons' new home of Auburn Hills would add to the sting of a 
Pistons' victory. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers lose, Auburn Hills Mayor Robert Grusnick will win the right to 
put up a Pistons sign on Kareem Court outside the Forum for 30 days. Also, 
Vincent will have to keep a stiff upper lip during an Inglewood City Council 
meeting while wearing a black "Bad Boys" T-shirt that sports pictures of Bill 
Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn. 
</P>
<P>
"California, here I come!" Grusnick sang into the telephone Friday morning, 
while whooping with laughter. "We're going to have the biggest sign you folks 
have ever seen. And you're not going to like it." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, along with a lot of Laker fans, was not available Friday to comment on 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
A city spokesman, however, said everyone at City Hall is behind the hometown 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"We are nervously optimistic," said Inglewood Assistant City Manager Norman 
Cravens. "The Lakers pulled it out last year after being down and we certainly 
think they'll do it again this year." 
</P>
<P>
A come-from-behind Laker championship would mean that Vincent would install a 
3-by-5 foot Lakers sign outside The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Pistons' home 
arena, and Grusnick would be forced to wear a Lakers' "Three-Peat" T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Grusnick scoffs at that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Hope He Fits Into It' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be (in Inglewood) to make sure your mayor wears our 'Bad Boys' 
shirt," Grusnick gloated. "I just hope he fits into it." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in a bet with Pontiac Mayor Walter Moore, Vincent walked away with 
two weeks' free use of a 1989 Pontiac Grand Prix SE -- a car he liked so much 
that he later bought it -- and enough light bulbs to illuminate City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers come out on top this time around, city officials said their sign 
in Michigan will promote Inglewood's recent designation as an All-America City. 
</P>
<P>
"My staff is coming up with some appropriately modest and tasteful suggestions 
that should not offend anybody -- except perhaps Pistons fans," Vincent said 
earlier in the week before the playoffs began.

INGLEWOOD POLICE HUNT FOR RAPE-MURDER SUSPECT, 19 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood police were still searching Saturday for a 19-year-old man described 
as "armed and extremely dangerous" who they said is the suspect in the rape and 
shooting one week ago of a 14-year-old girl, her mother and another woman, who 
died two days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The mother and daughter, who are still in a hospital, told police that their 
attacker is a youth they had seen hanging out near their home on Doty Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the suspect as J. C. Metoyer, who goes by the nicknames "Man 
Man" and "May May." The Inglewood Police Department asked for the public's 
assistance in finding Metoyer, who they believe is still in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred June 3 in the neighborhood south of the Hollywood Park race 
track in a home that the 33-year-old mother shared with her daughter, a 
19-year-old woman and two younger children. 
</P>
<P>
Metoyer, who has no permanent residence, often visited his grandmother, who 
lived on Doty Avenue, said Inglewood police Sgt. Harold Moret. 
</P>
<P>
About 1 a.m. on June 3, Metoyer approached the 19-year-old woman in front of 
her home, pushed a small-caliber pistol into her back and ordered her inside 
the house, Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that once Metoyer was inside the house, he tied the hands of the 
two women and a 14-year-old girl, raped all three and then shot each at least 
once in the head. The suspect fled with a pillowcase filled with valuables. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old woman died Tuesday morning at Los Angeles County Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center from a wound behind one ear. The two other victims are expected 
to survive, but the girl has lost the sight in her left eye after a bullet 
struck her there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Gangs 
</P>
<P>
Police said Metoyer has been affiliated with several different gangs and bears 
a scar on his stomach after being shot last year by a gang rival. Metoyer is 
described as 6-foot-1 to 6-foot-3, 180 pounds with a shaved head. 
</P>
<P>
He has lived in Compton and south Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that Metoyer is also suspected of firing shots in late May at a 
15-year-old who was riding a bicycle through the same Inglewood neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fellow who is out of control," Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents on Doty Avenue said they have not seen Metoyer recently, but 
the fear in the neighborhood is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woman Frightened 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a woman told two maintenance men who appeared suddenly outside her 
window that they had frightened her. "Don't you know these women were shot just 
over here!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors fear reprisals if they talk about Metoyer, the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this neighborhood are afraid," she said. "Why would they say 
anything, even if they knew where he was." 
</P>
<P>
Police said callers can give them information about Metoyer anonymously by 
calling 412-5210 or 412-5246.

BE READY FOR 'BIG ONE' AND FEAR IT LESS, MEMBERS OF RESPONSE TEAM SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Big One hits, Sandra Huszar is sure she won't get too shaken up. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just that extra pair of sneakers tucked in the trunk of her blue Trans 
Am or those four plastic jugs of water in the garage of her Northridge 
townhouse that give her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
As one of about 2,100 volunteer members of the city's Emergency Response Team 
program, Huszar has been trained to help herself and her neighbors survive a 
disastrous earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to get paralyzed -- not be able to move at all -- when even a little 
earthquake hit," said Huszar, 48, a native of Southern California. "I figured 
getting 17 1/2 hours of training from the Fire Department would help me get 
over my fear." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Huszar and about 150 other Emergency Response Team members gathered 
at Woodley Avenue Park in Van Nuys to celebrate the program's success with a 
picnic. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 14 months, the Los Angeles Fire Department's disaster preparedness 
division has trained 98 teams in the use of fire extinguishers, basic 
search-and-rescue techniques and first aid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Valley Teams 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Valley residents have been particularly active in the program, 
said Capt. Chris Burton, the division's commander. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 City Council districts that have teams, the one with the most teams 
-- nine -- is Councilwoman Joy Picus' West Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth of the program has been just phenomenal, which is fortunate because 
in a large natural disaster, there's just not going to be enough police 
officers, firefighters and paramedics," Burton said. "If these teams can take 
care of small problems in their neighborhoods like small fires, structure 
collapses and minor injuries, it would really have a calming effect." 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department trains people who form their own groups and is not involved 
in organizing the teams, Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
Classes are taught in the evening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For many team members, learning safety measures, such as how to turn off gas 
heaters to prevent fires in the event of broken gas lines, is the natural 
outgrowth of their already active involvement in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not easy persuading others to prepare for the Big One, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"We always say 'when' it hits, not 'if,' " said Jay Rothman, 55, a Studio City 
volunteer. "But it's like smoking -- you tell people it's bad for them, but 
you've got to hit them over the head with a hammer to get them to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for a catastrophe does not mean volunteers are obsessed by gloomy 
thoughts, said Donna Ryan, 42, of Studio City. "Once you've prepared, you don't 
have to think about it," she said.

OCEANSIDE WOMAN FOUND SLAIN IN HOME

Oceanside police were investigating the killing of an elderly woman who was 
found dead by her husband when he returned to the couple's home in the 800 
block of Rio Viento on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators released few details about the case, saying only that the woman, 
identified only as being about 65 years old, had been stabbed several times and 
was dead by the time they arrived at the scene

LAWNDALE CUTS BUDGET; NO LAYOFFS MADE YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council has cut a variety of expenditures from the city's 
proposed $7.8-million budget for 1989-90, but has not eliminated any jobs yet. 
</P>
<P>
Six employees have been targeted for layoffs as the council seeks to trim more 
than $400,000 to pay for increased Sheriff's Department services. At its first 
two budget workshops last week, however, the council instead cut the budgets of 
the six departments studied so far, Mayor Sarann Kruse said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's next budget workshop will be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday at City Hall, 
14717 Burin Ave. A public hearing on the budget has been scheduled for 7 p.m. 
June 19, also at City Hall.

HERMOSA BEACH TO BUY SURPLUS SCHOOL SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hermosa Beach school district is selling two surplus school sites for at 
least $3.2 million, and the city plans to buy them for park use, city and 
school officials said last week. Offered for sale are the 4.5-acre South School 
on Valley Drive and five lots adjoining the Edith Rodaway Park on Prospect 
Avenue next to the closed Prospect School. Mineral rights are not included. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said income from the sale will be used to continue remodeling 
and other improvements at the 700-student district's only remaining campus, 
Hermosa Valley School. 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect to complete the sales by the end of the year. Under provisions 
of the proposed sale agreement, ownership of the sites would revert to the 
school district if they are ever used for any purpose other than public open 
space.

STEVE HOWE STILL THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Howe, who hasn't thrown a pitch in the major leagues since a drinking 
incident ended his comeback attempt with the Texas Rangers, will be spending 
the coming weeks selling a new book. 
</P>
<P>
Howe wrote "Between the Lines" with Jim Greenfield, a Philadelphia attorney and 
former newsman, about his career, his cocaine addiction and recovery and the 
strains it put on his marriage, which has survived. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, 31, doesn't rule out another comeback attempt and said several teams have 
shown interest in him, but would not name them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to be able to walk away from the game because I can't get anybody out 
anymore," he said. But the left-handed reliever who was the National League 
Rookie of the Year in 1980 and thrown out of baseball for cocaine and alcohol 
abuse, won't accept any offers until next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the commitment to stay out of baseball for one full year," Howe said. 
"You have to understand that these commitments to myself are probably the most 
important things that I can keep for my recovery." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Howe was a reflective, humble man, far from the 
self-centered young upstart who thought he could control cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, while pitching for the Dodgers, checked into a drug rehabilitation clinic 
in 1983 and was suspended from playing the 1984 season by then-commissioner 
Bowie Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he's played for the Minnesota Twins, the Texas Rangers, in the 
minor leagues and, last summer, for a semipro club in Mexico. His last 
major-league stint ended when the Rangers terminated his two-year $1.2 million 
contract in January, 1988, for an incident involving alcohol during a three-day 
minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of his second season, in 1981, he said he was determined to prove 
he did not have a sophomore jinx. He kept his cocaine consumption to two or 
three grams a week, spending $3,000 in the four months between spring training 
and the players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
"My case is a victory. By the grace of God we overcame this and I'm still 
alive. I still have my family. I still have so many things; I still have my 
health. I have a chance Lenny Bias will never get," he said of the University 
of Maryland basketball star whose death was linked to cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said his healing began in earnest when he embraced God last Christmas. 
"The best treatment centers, the best help, the best psychologist in the world 
didn't fix me," he said. "There's a side of my spiritual self that had to 
totally believe in God to take it over."

AREA GOLFERS COMPETE FOR REGIONAL TITLE

<P>
A handful of Valley-area golfers open play at 7:30 a.m Monday in the Southern 
California High School Championship. And each hopes to be playing until it is 
nearly dusk. 
</P>
<P>
Two teams and several individuals from the area will be competing in the final 
high school tournament of the season at Bakersfield Country Club. The 10 low 
individuals from the morning round will play another 18 holes in the afternoon 
to determine the Southern California champion. The team competition, which 
includes Taft and Newbury Park, will be decided in the 18-hole morning round. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park finished second in the Southern Section team tournament at Wood 
Ranch Country Club in Simi Valley. Taft, which won its eighth City Section 
title at Griffith Park, features six underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
Players competing for the individual title at Bakersfield include teammates 
Charlie Wi and Jerry Chang of Westlake, who both qualified by shooting 
one-over-par 73s in the Southern Section individual tournament at Canyon 
Country Club in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
City individuals -- who qualified in an 18-hole shoot-out at Bel-Air Country 
Club on May 22 -- include Tony Bordwell of El Camino Real, who led all 
qualifiers in the 16-player field at Bel-Air with an eight-over-par 78. 
</P>
<P>
Other City qualifiers are Josh Oring of Granada Hills (82 at Bel-Air), Lance 
Oriti of Grant (85), Scott Appel of Birmingham (90) and Jonas Knudsen of 
Granada Hills (90). 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, with a five-man score of 401, finished one shot behind Estancia 
of Costa Mesa in the Southern Section championship. Brian Lamb led the Panthers 
-- who advance to the Southern California tournament for the first time -- with 
a four-over 76. 
</P>
<P>
Taft, champion of the City 5-A League, is led by freshman Ryan White, who had a 
team-best 36-hole total of 162 at Griffith Park. Taft won the team title with a 
two-day score of 835.

BURNHAM PLACES SECOND IN TAC JUNIOR NATIONALS 100 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High placed second in the 100 meters in The 
Athletics Congress junior championships at Ohio State University on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The top two finishers in each event qualify for the national junior (for 
athletes 19 and under) team that will compete in a series of international 
meets next month. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, who won her second consecutive titles in the 100 and 200 in last 
week's state championships at Cerritos College, was beaten by Stanford freshman 
Chryste Gaines (11.44 seconds to 11.55) in the 100 final after winning her 
qualifying heat in 11.94. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham is scheduled to run in the heats and the final of the 200 today, and 
Cal State Northridge freshman Garrett Noel will compete in the men's javelin. 
</P>
<P>
Lolita Pile of Cal State Northridge placed third in the women's triple jump 
Saturday in the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Invitational at UCLA's Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Pile, runner-up in last month's NCAA Division II championships, bounded 41 
feet, 8 3/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Hudson (43-9 3/4) and Sabrina Williams (42-4), both of the Nike Coast 
track club, placed first and second, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Two other CSUN athletes -- Darcy Arreola and Walt Stewart -- were entered in 
the meet, but did not compete. Arreola withdrew from the women's 800 because of 
illness and Stewart did not compete in the high jump when the event was 
canceled due to a lack of competitors.

SALKELD TO TEST LEGION BATTERS AS PRO CONTRACT TALKS CONTINUE

San Fernando's American Legion team absorbed a District 20 forfeit Saturday at 
the hands of Newhall-Saugus (Santa Clarita), but it could have been much more 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, San Fernando might have shown up. 
</P>
<P>
The scheduled pitcher for Newhall-Saugus in the Northern Division game at 
Saugus High was none other than right-hander Roger Salkeld, the No. 3 selection 
in the baseball free-agent draft last week. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, who was 13-1 and led Saugus High to the Southern Section 3-A Division 
final, was drafted by Seattle. And while negotiations continue between 
Salkeld's father, Bill, and Mariner officials, Roger says he plans to continue 
to play for Newhall-Saugus (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
"(Seattle) didn't say I couldn't," Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
A reprieve of sorts for San Fernando may soon turn into misfortune for others: 
Salkeld is scheduled to pitch in today's doubleheader against Burbank at 
Northwest Park at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, meanwhile, continues to pile up awards. Saugus High assistant coach 
Bill Bolde said the school was notified this week that Salkeld has been 
selected Gatorade California Player of the Year and is one of two pitchers 
named to the USA Today high school All-America team. STEVE ELLING

KEY SALMON FISHERY LATEST SPILL CASUALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest casualty of the March 24 Exxon Valdez oil spill is the major salmon 
fishery in Kamishak Bay at the southern end of Cook Inlet. Although ocean-borne 
oil from the spill had bypassed the bay, oil that washed ashore on nearby 
beaches has been pushed off the sand by recent storms and into the bay's 
fishing waters. The closure comes because of Alaska's zero-tolerance policy, 
meaning that the state will not tolerate any oil in the fishery to risk 
contaminating the catch or tainting the image of pristine Alaska seafood. The 
1,000-square-mile fishing district is " a very significant fishery ," biologist 
Tom Shroeder said, adding that canceling the bay's fishing "was always seen as 
a possibility through we expected it to be extremely remote."

Kurdish rebels accused Iraq of razing several towns and forcibly relocating 
19,000 people in a drive to stamp out the Kurdish identity and carve a security 
zone along the Iranian border. Diplomats and others in Iraq said the government 
has moved up to 500,000 Kurds and destroyed about 3,000 villages over the past 
few years in a major relocation effort. They said the plan is to cut the rebels 
off from sympathizers and to break up the tight-knit Kurdish clan system. "The 
Iraqis are pressing ahead with their mass deportation plan, and they're getting 
away with it," said a spokesman for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a leading 
rebel group. In Tehran, Iranian President Ali Khamenei pledged to support the 
Iraqi Kurds in their fight with the Baghdad regime.

Hungary's ruling Communist Party and its emerging opposition agreed on ground 
rules for negotiations beginning Tuesday to lead the country to multi-party 
democracy. The agreement, announced at a joint news conference in Budapest, 
lays down principles under which the Communist Party would cede some of the 
power it has exercised under single-party rule over the past 40 years. Opposite 
the Communist Party at the negotiations will be delegates of the Opposition 
Round Table, which embraces nine non-Communist organizations.

A man who astonished doctors by reviving 40 minutes after he was declared dead 
from a jolt of electricity was in critical condition, hospital officials in 
Joplin, Mo., said. Jerry Middleswart was breathing with the aid of a respirator 
at St. John's Regional Medical Center. He had been declared dead a day earlier 
after the antenna he and six other men were attempting to put up at his Oswego, 
Kan., veterinary clinic came in contact with a 7,600-volt power line. Tests 
indicated Middleswart had suffered brain damage. "He was a friend of mine," 
said Dr. Phillip Bortmes, who worked for 45 minutes to revive Middleswart. "I 
made damn sure I tried everything before I stopped working on him."

The last ashes of union martyr Joe Hill were scattered at a Lafayette, Colo., 
cemetery where five striking unionized coal miners who were gunned down by 
militiamen and guards at the Columbine Mine on Nov. 21, 1927, are buried. Hill 
was an organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World, known as the 
Wobblies. A granite marker with the names of six slain miners was unveiled in 
the cemetery 20 miles northwest of Denver. In 1915, Hill was executed in Utah 
for a murder in Salt Lake City, where he had been organizing workers. 
Supporters said the mining industry framed Hill. His body was cremated and his 
ashes were scattered in many states.

About 420 temporary workers have left their jobs at the Rancho Seco nuclear 
power plant since Sacramento-area residents voted to close it down. The 
citizen-owned utility that operated the plant 25 miles southeast of Sacramento 
also accepted the resignation of the engineer who was managing it. Separation 
notices were expected to be sent to about 1,000 regular plant employees by the 
end of the month. "Now that the voters have decided they don't want Rancho 
Seco, it's time to move on," said plant boss Joseph Firlit. "I'm a builder, not 
an undertaker."

On the second anniversary of the riots that brought down the authoritarian 
regime of former South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan, thousands of radical 
students battled riot police in Seoul. The students called for the overthrow of 
President Roh Tae Woo and the expulsion of U.S. troops. Opposition groups 
denounced Roh for failing to go ahead with a promised referendum on his 
presidency. Roh has said he decided against the vote because it would create 
unrest. The protesters used rocks, clubs and firebombs against police, and more 
than 1,000 people were arrested.

NEWSMAKERS: LIFE WITH ERNIE, MAUD: IT'S A BALL

 -- A Gilroy, Calif., couple are welcoming friends and four generations of 
descendants to celebrate one of the world's longest marriages -- 80 years. 
Ernie Scott and his wife, Maud, wed on June 16, 1909, have three daughters, 16 
grandchildren, 48 great-grandchildren and 34 great-great grandchildren. On 
their kitchen wall is a gift from a friend that reads: "Old Age Is Not for 
Sissies," which fits their hardscrabble lives and illustrates the humor they 
say was important in their marriage. The couple lived in many states across 
America, sometimes separately as Ernie, now 101, moved on to new jobs. He 
farmed in South Dakota but "was dried out and . . . froze out" during the Dust 
Bowl, he says. He also had been an amateur boxer and proudly says: "I never was 
marked . . . . I think I could box a little yet." Maud, now 97, was a member of 
the Coast Guard during World War II, serving on the Great Lakes. She says she 
reads voraciously and her happiest memories are when she was in school. 
Laughing, she explains: "I wasn't married then." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jack Yates Senior High School valedictorian Carrie Mae Dixon had feared 
that school officials would not let her give a graduation address because the 
unmarried 18-year-old has one child and is seven months pregnant with a second. 
But the officials decided there was no policy to prevent her from speaking, and 
she appeared before her 400 classmates in Houston. Dixon's case drew attention 
in April when Principal Chester Smith barred as too personal a school newspaper 
article detailing Dixon's first pregnancy and her moves to various relatives 
after her mother died and her stepfather abandoned the children. On stage with 
Dixon were other honor students, including her boyfriend, Mark Nealy, father of 
the baby she is carrying. He is a National Merit Scholar and vice president of 
the graduating class. Dixon has $17,500 in scholarships and plans to attend the 
University of Houston.

 -- It wasn't the ship of state he was on, but Vice President Dan Quayle got a 
little official help to ensure smooth sailing. Quayle, wife Marilyn, and 
children Benjamin, Corinne and Tucker took a whitewater rafting trip down the 
New River in West Virginia -- after the Army Corps of Engineers lowered the 
water level for them. The corps decreased the flow from Bluestone Dam, 40 miles 
upriver, to provide a safer, pleasant trip. Of course, three rafts of Secret 
Service agents also went along for the ride. "He'll have a kinder, gentler 
ride," quipped Susan Hanger, operator of a rafting business. DAVE JOHNSON

ALBERT J. LIMA; LEADER IN STATE'S COMMUNIST PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Staff and Wire Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Albert J. (Mickie) Lima, a state leader of the Communist Party during the 
Red-scare era of the 1950s, has died of cancer at 82. 
</P>
<P>
Lima, who died at his Oakland home June 3, was convicted of threatening the 
overthrow of the U.S. government, but the Los Angeles federal jury decision was 
ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, he was charged with defying a federal order to register as 
an enemy agent. The Supreme Court again said the charge was unconstitutional 
and freed him. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the small coastal mill town of Usal in California's Mendocino County, 
Lima ended a 13-year ban on communist speakers at UC Berkeley in 1963 when he 
delivered an address to about 1,400 people as Wheeler Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"The very fact of my speaking here today might well prove more important than 
anything I may say," he told his audience. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Helen, said they met in 1935 when he helped organize a union and a 
strike at the Arcata Barrel Factory, where he had gone to work after high 
school. The six-week strike ended with a police attack that resulted in the 
deaths of three workers. The union leaders and 114 workers were arrested and 
spent six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The incident left Lima a committed member of the Communist Party, she said. He 
started out as a field organizer and worked his way into leadership of the 
state Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Lima ran for Congress twice unsuccessfully as a Communist. He also attended the 
50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in Moscow as Northern California's 
party chief. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters and three grandchildren.

T.A. FRANCOIS; RIGHTS LAWYER, EX-S.F. SUPERVISOR

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry A. Francois, a civil rights lawyer who became the first black to sit on 
the city's Board of Supervisors, died Friday of cancer. He was 67. Francois, 
who died at his San Francisco home after a five-year battle against cancer, 
served on the board for 14 years before resigning to return to private law 
practice in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to serving as a supervisor, Francois was known in the city for his 
early activism, including his arrest on Sept. 15, 1963, along with 10 others 
outside a real estate company during a sit-in protesting housing discrimination 
against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
As a lawyer for the local chapter of the NAACP, Francois also filed suits 
against discrimination in housing, jobs and education and fought for the 
appointment of blacks to political office. After only two years in practice, 
Francois in 1952 sued the San Francisco Housing Authority, charging it admitted 
only white and Asian families to a new city housing project. 
</P>
<P>
In a later suit, he charged he was refused service in a local tavern because he 
was black, and in 1955 he began filing complaints of police brutality. In 1956, 
he toured the state on behalf of Republican presidential candidate Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
Francois' efforts in 1957, as a lawyer for the NAACP, led to creation of a fair 
employment practices ordinance in San Francisco. "In San Francisco a Negro can 
eat almost anywhere, but will have trouble finding a job to enable him to pay 
for his meal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, he sued two realtors who prevented him from buying a house in St. 
Francis Wood and then joined picketers in Forest Hill, another expensive 
neighborhood. The man who demanded to be shown a home in that tract was an 
unknown young black attorney, Willie Brown Jr., now state Assembly Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Francois was named to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1964 by Mayor 
John Shelley, and in 1967 won election to a four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New Orleans, Francois was a graduate of Xavier University there in 1940 
and earned a master's degree in business at Atlanta University in Georgia. 
After serving as a Marine platoon sergeant in World War II, Francois came to 
San Francisco, where in 1949 he earned a law degree at the University of 
California's Hastings Law School. 
</P>
<P>
He was married in Oakland in 1947 to Marion Le Blanc, who survives him. Also 
surviving are a daughter, four sons, two sisters and six grandchildren.

HELLS ANGELS STAGE FUNERAL FOR LEADER KILLED IN BAR FIGHT

Michael (Irish) O'Farrell, a Hells Angels leader, received the club's 
traditional funeral honors Saturday as bikers wearing jackets emblazoned with a 
winged skull escorted his body to a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
O'Farrell, believed by law enforcement officials to be second in the Hells 
Angels hierarchy only to the motorcycle club's spiritual leader, Ralph (Sonny) 
Barger Jr., died during a bloody bar brawl on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Farrell, 40, who along with Barger was awaiting sentencing on federal 
explosives convictions, was stabbed in the neck, chest and back, as well as 
being shot four times from behind, according to the Alameda County coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people filed into a funeral home in East Oakland to pay final 
respects to O'Farrell, who acted as president of the club's Oakland chapter in 
the early 1980s while Barger recovered from a throat operation for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting O'Farrell's closed casket, decorated with flowers and pictures 
of him on his motorcycle, mourners walked into an adjoining room to offer 
condolences to Barger. Motorcycle clubs throughout the West sent wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
A motive has not been established for the slaying, but Alameda County Sheriff's 
Lt. Dean Hess said "drugs were involved." Powdered methamphetamine, better 
known as speed, was found on the patio of the San Leandro bar where the killing 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are searching for Michael Shepherd, 31, who has been charged with 
homicide in connection with O'Farrell's death. A man nicknamed Jerry also is 
being sought by detectives for investigation of firing several shots during the 
fight, including one that wounded Michael Musick, 42, another Hells Angels 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Barger and O'Farrell, both of Oakland, were convicted in October in federal 
court of conspiracy to transport and receive in interstate commerce explosives 
with intent to kill. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure as temporary national leader of the Hells Angels, O'Farrell 
defended the club, telling the Los Angeles Times in 1983, "We're not organized 
crime."

Albert Spaggiari, 57, mastermind of the spectacular "sewer gang" bank heist and 
on the run for 12 years, died and his body was left outside his mother's house 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Spaggiari's body was brought to his mother's home in this Riviera 
city early Saturday by two men who fled. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Peyrat, Spaggiari's lawyer, said his client died of lung cancer on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Spaggiari formed the gang of "sewer rats" who tunneled their way into the 
Societe Generale bank in Nice and, over the weekend of July 17-19, 1976, opened 
337 safe deposit boxes and took gold, jewelry and negotiable paper worth about 
$6.8 million.

TENANTS AND LANDLORDS AGREE ON FRUSTRATION OVER EVICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Esther Walton and Shi-Chin Tung burn in isolated middle-aged frustration. Were 
they to meet, they might appreciate the other's position, but politically this 
is daydreaming. Their lives have been too warped by experience. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, 63, lives alone in a $241-a-month, one-bedroom apartment with a 
water-stained ceiling in Venice, three blocks from the ocean. Her rent is 
remarkably low because she has lived there 10 years; only small annual 
increases have been permitted by Los Angeles' rent control law. The Westside 
real estate binge has barely touched her. Another one-bedroom unit in the 
complex, recently decontrolled when a tenant left, goes for $695. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Technique 
</P>
<P>
The manager of Walton's building recently attempted to evict her by saying he 
wanted to use her unit for a resident manager. The technique is legal, and no 
relocation benefits are required under the city's rent control law. (Relocation 
assistance of $2,000 to $5,000 is required when a landlord is evicting to 
provide housing for a relative, to demolish the building or to perform more 
than $10,000 worth of work.) 
</P>
<P>
However, tenant advocates routinely complain that unscrupulous landlords bring 
in friends as rent-free resident managers to replace long-term tenants. Then, 
after a few months, the resident manager leaves, and the landlord rents the 
apartment at a far higher rate. That is illegal. First, evictions to make room 
for resident-managers must be made in "good faith," and second, the unit would 
not be decontrolled if the resident manager left and the landlord decided to 
rent it out. However, such maneuvering is largely beyond the ability of the 
city Rent Stabilization Division to monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Before Walton's eviction was filed in court, her landlord offered to pay her 
$5,000 to move. Most tenants, fearing the inevitable, accept such buyouts, but 
Walton declined. Rents were so high that the money would evaporate within a few 
months and she would be homeless, she feared. 
</P>
<P>
She found a legal-aid attorney, and eventually the landlord dropped the 
eviction suit with some bitterness, complaining that Walton was "an obstinate 
old lady" with a " 'Grapes of Wrath' mentality." 
</P>
<P>
But while Walton had won, the Angst would not leave. 
</P>
<P>
"You become obsessional, depressed, angry and somewhat out of control," she 
said. I would have these continuous dialogues in my head between him and me. 
It's been terrible for me. I'm still emotionally hung up." 
</P>
<P>
Two months after that interview, her outlook has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at most things as sour," she says. "It wears on you. You just get the 
feeling you're really being used, and I'm not the only person this is happening 
to. It was like a trick played on me." 
</P>
<P>
Shi-Chin Tung, a 65-year-old retired cook, feels a trick has been played on 
him, too. 
</P>
<P>
Tung owns two small apartment buildings in the Pico-Fairfax area of West Los 
Angeles. He has put them both up for sale. He talks bitterly in broken English 
about moving back to his native China. He has lived in America for 20 years, 
but he has grown to feel angrily betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I very close to Americans. I can't (feel) close any more. (Too many) liars," 
he says at his dining room table, his daughter sitting by to interpret when 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
It was always Tung's dream to own property, first a home for his family, then 
these investment properties. But nowadays he says he cannot find reliable 
tenants for the $750-a-month units he rents, and he believes that rent control 
-- which places numerous procedural burdens on evictions -- makes it impossible 
for him to keep order. 
</P>
<P>
In the eight-unit building where Tung lives, three units are vacant. Two good 
tenants moved out because a third unit -- now empty thanks to a messy eviction 
-- was turned into an obnoxious keg of noise by a pair of young men who stopped 
paying rent after their parents' support quit, according to Tung. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people get away with lying because of the law . . . too many 
loopholes," he says. In court, the young men signed a judgment promising to pay 
$3,181 in back rent. Tung says he has not seen a cent. 
</P>
<P>
Why? he asks. Why do nine-tenths of the people who apply to rent his units have 
lousy credit records or past evictions? Why does he lose good tenants, like the 
one at his other building in Pasadena who left because the next-door neighbor 
fired a shotgun through her apartment? "You are a very good landlord and I hope 
you have better luck finding good tenants," she wrote. It was a small 
condolence. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Americans," Tung says, pulling out a scrapbook with photographs of the 
many American families who employed him. "But I don't want to stay anymore. 
Owner call police, no can do nothing. Owner call court, no can do nothing. I 
don't like to (go to) jail. I don't like kill people. But I do! I so mad!" 
</P>
<P>
It sounded like anguish of an old man. But Tung's children are taking no 
chances. They have removed their father's gun from his apartment. BOB BAKER

MAN ARRESTED IN SHOOTING OF 2 BOYS, OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Compton man dressed in military fatigues wounded two boys and fired at a 
police officer in a bullet-proof vest before being arrested Friday night, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
At about 5:30 p.m., Grayland Williams, 36, allegedly shot a 10-year-old boy in 
the head and a 14-year-old in the leg outside his home in the 1400 block of 
South Kemp Avenue, authorities said. The first boy was listed in serious 
condition at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center; the second boy was 
listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
An officer wearing a bullet-proof vest was slightly injured when the suspect 
fired a shotgun blast at him before being arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Another man was wounded Friday night after he allegedly fired at officers in 
South-Central Los Angeles, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies said Manuel 
James Earles, 18, was in serious condition after they shot him when he opened 
fire on an anti-gang task force that was trying to question him.

SUSPECTED SLAYER, RAPIST ARRESTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of raping two women and a 14-year-old girl and then shooting 
them execution-style, one fatally, in Inglewood was arrested Saturday night 
after the family of the dead victim saw him while driving to her funeral, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
J. C. Metoyer, 19, was arrested without incident at 6 p.m. at Crenshaw 
Boulevard and 47th Street in Los Angeles after the family of Sarah Laureana, 
19, called police. Metoyer, who is being held without bail, was booked on one 
count of murder, three counts of rape and three counts of robbery, said 
Inglewood Sgt. Harold Moret. 
</P>
<P>
Metoyer is the grandson of one of the victims' neighbors, authorities said. 
Police said they do not have a motive for the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't figure it out," Moret said. "I spoke to him. He's just as calm as can 
be."

SUMMER JOBS FOR YOUTH AT DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Bob Secter's article (June 4) entitled "Summer Work at Disneyland Holds 
Little Magic for Youth of Today": 
</P>
<P>
I am the mother of two Orange County kids who worked at Disneyland in the past. 
Perhaps Secter should also have interviewed past and present young employees of 
Disneyland. He might have had a more balanced picture of Disneyland's 
employment problems. 
</P>
<P>
My daughter at age 21 (no spoiled O.C. kid) went to work part time for 
Disneyland in 1984 while she attended college. She still remembers her 
employment by Disneyland in a negative way and states she felt the employees' 
welfare didn't matter to most of the management. "Making money was the bottom 
line in employee relations." 
</P>
<P>
In the past under the old "Disney" regime, a paternalistic system existed where 
rigid employee rules were enforced to create a pleasant and courteous 
environment for patrons. "Big Brother" looked over the employees' shoulders and 
wrote up the slightest infractions for breaking appearance and behavior codes. 
However, "Big Brother" truly cared about his kids and let them know. 
Paternalism works with young employees if it's a two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Disneyland is a one-way street. The chastisements abound, but 
incentives (such as praise) don't seem to exist. Employees are hired as casual 
temporary workers. Why would Orange County kids work for $4.75 per hour base 
rate (plus a small differential) from 9:45 p.m. to 2:45 a.m. per night -- which 
includes driving the freeways alone during early morning hours -- if they can 
get better pay and better hours from another employer? 
</P>
<P>
The kids smile sweetly in their special costumes as they survive another day at 
Disneyland because, after all, they work for "the happiest place on earth." Are 
they paid enough for the bad hours, customer hassles and little or no praise 
from management? Absolutely not -- neither in dollars nor in humane employee 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than aim sarcasm at Orange County's kids who don't want to work at 
Disneyland, perhaps Secter might give the kids credit for choosing to become 
valued employees instead of cogs in a money machine.

SUMMER JOBS FOR YOUTH AT DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With reference to your essay (June 4) on summer work at Disneyland, Bob Secter 
enumerates the dress code and other regulations given by Disneyland to its 
prospective employees. He sarcastically and judgmentally denigrates youths of 
today as if young men with earrings are the norm. 
</P>
<P>
What he fails to discuss is the scholar-athletes and student leaders that are 
more the norm of today's youth. They are even recognized in the same newspaper 
as his article (see Sports and the outstanding student citizen section). 
</P>
<P>
He also fails to mention that the general admission price of entrance to this 
park is $23.50. Anyone who is paid as little as $4.75 to $5 an hour couldn't 
even afford to get in.

THE ANIMAL RIGHTS ISSUE AND ITS ROLE IN SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to T. Rose's letter, anytime I hear someone say, "I love animals. I 
have a dog, but . . ." I know that this person hasn't the faintest idea what 
the animal rights/anti-vivisectionist movement is about. It's like the 
researcher who says he loves dogs, has a dog at home and goes to the dog lab at 
the university and, without a sidelong glance, instructs students on how to cut 
open a dog with a minimum of anesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
This movement is not just caring about animals, it's primarily caring about 
people. Accutane is a good example. This drug, recently in the news because it 
harms the fetus of pregnant women, tested on animals as safe for humans. 
Acetaminophen has been associated with kidney failure and kidney disease when 
taken every day for years. Prolonged daily use of ibuprofen also harms kidneys. 
Daily uses of phenacetin had five times the usual risk of kidney damage. All 
tested on animals as safe for human consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The animal rights movement cares about people and animals. Since many of these 
drugs harm people, the movement is concerned. Humans are being injured and 
killed, animals are being killed. 
</P>
<P>
As for sacrificing all five of T. Rose's well-loved pets to save a child, I can 
tell her that "killing her pet won't save her baby" or anybody else's. Since a 
human being is not a cat, a rat, a dog or a bird, there is no correlation to 
any cure of an animal to a human. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as being cold and having to wear fur, nonsense. Buy a heavy sweater 
or a good fake fur. Wearing real fur is only a status symbol, an 
"I'm-better-than-you attitude because I paid a lot of money for this real fur 
coat." Well-managed and maintained fur farms, if there are such a things, are 
still cruelty factories. There is no "necessary trapping." Traps ensnare "trash 
animals," such as dogs, cats, birds and even small children. 
</P>
<P>
T. Rose may be surprised to learn that a lot of animal-rights activists do not 
have companion pets. They are simply concerned for their own health and their 
tax dollars pouring into medical fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Since abused children and neglected old people already have their advocates, 
would T. Rose be so parsimonious as to disallow another segment of creativity 
its advocate? The abuses of animals should not go unnoticed, unless we wish to 
do so at the expense of all human character.

IRVINE'S STAND ON THREATS TO OZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The purpose of this letter is to express concern about the current political 
activities of the mayor of Irvine and several members of the Irvine City 
Council. They have made public statements concerning radically reducing the 
budget of the Department of Defense, they passed an ordinance broadening civil 
rights, and now they are discussing special rules designed to protect the ozone 
layer of the earth's atmosphere. A very ambitious project for any city council! 
</P>
<P>
Even if we concede that the council members are acting out of the noblest 
motives, it is clear that they are greatly exceeding their mandate when they 
concern themselves with national issues. We have elected President Bush and 
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) to deal with such matters. It only 
causes confusion when cities formulate their own policies on national defense, 
universal civil rights and environmental issues that really call for 
international agreement. Are we going to have an Irvine policy on NATO, Central 
America, South Africa and immigration? 
</P>
<P>
We elected Mayor Larry Agran and the other council members to look after local 
problems, such as zoning, streets, parks, police and fire protection. We voted 
for them because we believed they were competent in these matters, and because 
we more or less agreed with the positions they had taken on the local issues. 
It does not seem right that they should take their election to the local office 
as a mandate to meddle in broader matters that are properly in the purview of 
our national government. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us would differ with them on the national issues, and it is highly 
unlikely that they would receive the vote of the majority of the residents of 
Irvine if they decided to run for Congress. As a matter of fact, we should 
already be asking if we made the right choice by electing to the council people 
who do not find running the city challenging enough and intrude into the domain 
of other branches of the government.

THE 15-YEAR-OLD BICYCLIST WHO GOT A $96 TICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As longtime residents of Irvine, my husband and I are outraged with the Irvine 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Our 15-year-old son was recently stopped on his bicycle by a police officer in 
a car and given a ticket for failure to make a complete stop at a stop sign by 
our home. 
</P>
<P>
If the officer was truly concerned about the safety factor in our son's failure 
to stop, surely he might have considered giving him a verbal warning, 
especially in light of his status as a first-time "offender." 
</P>
<P>
However, as much as this griped us, we were even more unprepared for the shock 
we received when the bail information arrived in the mail. We could not believe 
our eyes when we saw the amount: $96! We know of a friend who was ticketed in 
her car for the same offense several blocks away whose bail was only $60. This 
is justice? 
</P>
<P>
We have no intention of handing over this outrageous amount without a fight. Of 
course, that means either my husband or I will have to take time off from work, 
with the accompanying loss of income. So, in other words, even if we win we 
still lose. Valuable court time, already bogged down to a virtual crisis, will 
also be wasted over this heinous crime. 
</P>
<P>
Justice? Give me a break.

SAME CONFERENCE, 2 DIFFERENT STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We wish to bring (to) your attention a situation with the potential to damage 
the credibility of your business section. 
</P>
<P>
We enclose two articles. One, which appeared in the May 3 Orange County Edition 
of the Los Angeles Times, was written by Michael Flagg ("Meeting Name Changes, 
but It's Still Ruff Stuff"). The other article, written by Earl Gottschalk Jr., 
appeared in the May 5 issue of the Wall Street Journal. Both articles concern 
the same subject, Howard Ruff and the National Conference for Independent 
Investors, which was held in Anaheim from April 30 through May 3. 
</P>
<P>
The articles are quite different, not only in style but in content. I attended 
this conference, and witnessed Mr. Flagg's interview with Mr. Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal correctly noted that "Mr. Ruff is now bearish on gold and silver" 
and quotes Mr. Ruff on the price of gold: "I wouldn't bet against $300. Well, 
even $250 wouldn't surprise me." Your reporter, on the other hand, exclaimed in 
his lead paragraph how Howard Ruff was "ready to . . . extol the virtues of 
precious metals." Mr. Flagg was incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Ruff's investment recommendation, as accurately reported in the Journal: 
"Buy 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds and utility stocks, whose prices will 
climb when interest rates fall in the coming recession." The Times article 
reads: "Much of his advice is on how to cope with the aftermath of disaster; 
things like buying silver -- in case paper money becomes worthless -- and 
stocking supplies of food." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Gottschalk noted in the Journal that several conference-goers "longed for 
the Ruff conferences of the past, where advisers sketched portraits of the 
coming apocalypse and the exhibit hall was peppered with survivalist food 
booths." In reading Mr. Flagg's article, one can't help but wonder if he didn't 
merely rehash articles written by others, several years ago. Sir, we do not 
read the Los Angeles Times for rehashes of dated news stories.

'IDEALISTIC' THOUGHTS ON EXECUTIVES' PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed your Disney article ("Delayed Ride at Disneyland Has Been Making 
Quite a Splash," April 30). Your timing along with the May 1 issue of 
Businessweek is interesting, and I wonder if it caused any questioning in your 
mind as it did mine. 
</P>
<P>
Let me explain. 
</P>
<P>
I had read the Businessweek issue and was somewhat appalled at the salaries 
that made up the cover story for "Executive Pay." No. 1 happens to be Michael 
Eisner of Disney, ultimately responsible for the layoffs of personnel because 
of "off-the-shelf" thinking and consequently the delay and cost overruns for 
Splash Mountain. But because of his "revising Disney's dismal fortunes," he is 
rewarded with $40.1 million, and the cost of Cash Mountain goes from $20-25 
million to $70 million. I wish I could be so rewarded. Better yet, I wish that 
the previous employees could have been kept, utilized and paid decent wages 
instead of let go. After all, at $40-plus million, you could have retained 200 
people at $50,000 per year for four years. Plus the possibility exists that the 
terminated specialists could have kept the Splash Mountain's original 
construction and cost schedules, which means an additional $45-50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, you can tell that I do not possess an MBA. But in this day of 
individuals "earning" more than some developing countries, I wonder. Would 
America's economy be more competitive if the business managers (who should be 
leaders) were to accept a fair wage? They would not have to be asked to bite 
the bullet like those who have taken pay cuts for a better America, or those on 
minimum wage. Just accept a fair wage and allow the remaining monies to be 
reinvested, let's say, for sorely needed American R&amp;D. 
</P>
<P>
Naw. Too silly. Too idealistic. Too simplistic for such a complex situation. Or 
is it? 
</P>
<P>
I am not a socialist. I am a proud American capitalist who thinks that America 
needs some basic value changes to better compete in the world market, and I 
think that executive America can also contribute to this effort.

MOVIEGOER LAUDS LISTENING DEVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking as a professional with disposable income, I will be honored to dispose 
of part of my income at the Laguna Hills Mann Theatres. Due to my hearing 
impairment, I have limited myself almost exclusively to foreign movies with 
subtitles or legitimate theaters with . . . listening devices. Now a county 
movie theater has added (the) devices. 
</P>
<P>
I was thrilled to read about what Mann is doing in your business section 
("Infrared Devices Bring Talkies to Hard of Hearing," May 30) and just hope the 
competitive market or occasionally even social concern will move a few others 
to join. 
</P>
<P>
So thank you, Mann Theatres. You'll be happy to know I buy popcorn and usually 
bring a date.

<P>
DRUG'S LONG ROAD TO FDA APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small truck rumbled south from New Jersey in late 1983 with an unlikely 
one-ton load -- an 851-volume application to the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration for permission to sell a single drug for aching joints. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, called Voltaren, was no major breakthrough. It represented little or 
no advance over what was already available, federal officials said. It was 
similar in many ways to a half-dozen other arthritis drugs the FDA had already 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
But 4 1/2 years would slide by before the FDA approved Voltaren -- more time 
than was taken to build Hoover Dam. Before Americans could use Voltaren, it 
would be available in 120 other countries and would become the top-selling 
arthritis drug in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time, Expense 
</P>
<P>
Voltaren's odyssey through the federal bureaucracy offers a graphic picture of 
the time and expense required to get a new drug on the market -- conditions 
that lie at the heart of a bitter debate over Americans' access, or lack of it, 
to innovative drugs. 
</P>
<P>
It takes an average of 30 months to get a prescription drug through the FDA -- 
on top of three to 10 years of development and testing. The cost of delays to 
firms, in added expenses and lost sales, has been estimated at $1 million a 
month -- not to mention the price in public health. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say the estimated $125-million cost of moving a drug from 
discovery to market has become a disincentive to pharmaceutical research. That 
research has helped spawn a $40-billion-a-year industry and extend the average 
American's life span. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, public impatience for new treatments for diseases like AIDS and 
Alzheimer's has inspired an outcry for an overhaul of the FDA's review process. 
Some want the FDA to move more quickly; others want some approval requirements 
removed so new drugs will be available sooner. 
</P>
<P>
That outcry has raised the question: Can the drug-approval system be made more 
efficient without risking disaster? Can it be accelerated without undermining 
the scientific scrutiny credited with keeping dangerous drugs like Thalidomide 
off the U.S. market? 
</P>
<P>
"The question is: What are the trade-offs?" Dr. Samuel O. Thier, president of 
the federal Institute of Medicine, said in a recent interview. "What are we 
gaining in terms of safety versus what are we giving up in not having drugs 
available for a year or two?" 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with dozens of industry officials, regulators and others in recent 
months suggest that problems lie not in the design of the system itself, but in 
the conditions under which it has been forced to operate, perpetually hamstrung 
by shortages of funding and staff. 
</P>
<P>
* Federal budget cutting in the last decade has left FDA staffing well below 
what it was just 10 years ago. For want of a typist, physician-reviewers often 
type lengthy drug reports themselves. Crucial FDA documents go untyped or 
unprinted for months. 
</P>
<P>
Uncompetitive salaries make it difficult to hire qualified scientists for the 
FDA, and to keep them from defecting to private industry. Every year, the 
agency loses 10% of its drug reviewers, according to FDA Commissioner Frank 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
* Working conditions at the FDA are notorious. Offices are overcrowded, 
equipment is outdated, desks are occasionally shared. Electronic equipment to 
speed the review process is donated or loaned by drug companies that the agency 
polices. 
</P>
<P>
* The FDA's workload has multiplied with the advent of AIDS, the rise of 
biotechnology and the development of new drugs for an aging population. 
Applications for permission to test AIDS products alone have multiplied -- from 
five in 1982 to 275 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfer of Staff 
</P>
<P>
To handle the increase, FDA reviewers and other staff members have been 
reassigned to divisions handling AIDS drugs. Those transfers have left other 
offices and divisions riddled with vacancies, agency officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical industry often adds to the problem, studies by the FDA and 
industry researchers suggest. Firms impatient to get their products on the 
market sometimes take short cuts in designing their drug studies, then fail to 
meet FDA requirements. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, time-consuming drug trials must be repeated and the review process 
is delayed while applications are "recycled" back and forth between the agency 
and companies. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to think it's all the FDA's fault," said Thier, whose institute is 
part of the National Academy of Sciences. "(But) people are pressing for 
reducing the cost, increasing the safety, and getting drugs to market as fast 
as possible. You can't do all that simultaneously." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think public policy has been terribly realistic," added Dr. Theodore 
Cooper, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the Upjohn Co. and 
a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of health. "As a company man right 
now, I'd much rather see them have adequate resources and then I could feel 
better about bitching about their performance." 
</P>
<P>
Voltaren was far from an unknown quantity by the time the truck from the 
Ciba-Geigy Corp. backed up to the FDA loading dock on Dec. 20, 1983. It had 
been used widely by patients in Japan, Switzerland, France, Italy, Belgium and 
Germany since the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
For the previous three years, Ciba-Geigy had put it through the dozens of tests 
required by the FDA for approval. Scientists had tested the drug in animals, 
then in humans, on arthritic hips and arthritic knees, in studies lasting from 
six weeks to a year. 
</P>
<P>
The data filled hundreds of colored binders. There were laboratory reports, 
analyses, medical records of thousands of patients. Binders were copied in 
triplicate for the FDA's physicians, pharmacists, chemists, statisticians and 
specialists in pharmacokinetics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of a Long Trip 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Fengler, a young Ciba-Geigy regulatory affairs specialist who had 
accompanied the application down from headquarters in Summit, N.J., watched as 
five years' work disappeared into the massive belly of the FDA building in 
Rockville, Md., a suburb of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Did she ever imagine that another 4 1/2 years would elapse before approval? 
</P>
<P>
"You always assume it's not going to go 'one, two, three,' " Fengler answered, 
diplomatically. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA, after all, is a gargantuan bureaucracy. It has more than 7,000 
employees and a half-billion-dollar budget. It is the largest 
consumer-protection agency in the federal government, overseeing an estimated 
25% of all consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
The time swallowed up in drug review has been a sore point since the 1970s, 
when it became apparent that it was taking close to a decade to get a drug to 
market. The FDA has tried repeatedly -- and failed -- to cut the average time 
required for approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We've in one way or another been trying to 'speed things up' for at least 15 
years," said Dr. Robert Temple, director of one of the FDA's offices of drug 
evaluation. "But the average approval time hasn't changed in a long time. 
There's no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why, Temple said: "That's not easy to answer. One possibility is that 
we're holding our own even though the (applications) are getting larger, and 
that what we've been able to do is not so bad considering how much more there 
is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reasons for Delay 
</P>
<P>
But Fengler had other reasons to expect that approval would not come quickly: 
Arthritis drugs are toxic and can damage the digestive tract and liver. One 
year before, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. had pulled one from the market amid reports of 
dozens of drug-induced deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, called Oraflex, had been approved just months earlier by the same FDA 
division that would later review Voltaren. Lilly was eventually prosecuted and 
fined $25,000 by the Justice Department for having withheld information about 
the drug from the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at each drug with the experience of the ones we have behind us," said 
Dotti Pease, an FDA project manager on the Voltaren application. "If (Lilly) 
had told us about the liver problems . . . we might have done something 
different."

The Voltaren application reached Pease's division in early 1984. It went 
immediately to an in-house chemist for review. A second copy went to an FDA 
pharmacologist to review such things as the animal studies to determine how 
they might apply to humans. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pease, the chemist completed his review early. The pharmacologist 
completed his in January, 1985 -- but then it took the pharmacologist six 
months to have the review typed, circulated and approved. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not unusual," Pease said, ensconced in a tiny office piled high with 
documents. "We sometimes get to the point where if we just can't get enough 
typists to type things, we just put things in our files in handwriting -- if 
you can read the reviewer's writing. 
</P>
<P>
"You might have a hundred-page handwritten review in the file," said Pease, 
adding later that the situation has begun to improve. "If we just didn't see 
any hope of ever getting it typed, we would just put it in the file that way, 
hoping that people could read it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Centerpiece of Process 
</P>
<P>
A third copy of the application went to an FDA physician for a so-called 
medical review, the centerpiece of the FDA process. That review entails 
weighing a drug's benefits and risks, in addition to analyzing its 
side-effects, proper dosages and labeling. 
</P>
<P>
The medical reviewer took about a year to complete his examination. It came in 
unusually long, at about 600 pages. Then, according to Pease, "The reviewer got 
tired of waiting for a typist to type it. So he asked the company to type it." 
</P>
<P>
The company obliged -- a step Pease acknowledged was highly irregular. But any 
question of appropriateness shortly became moot: The FDA reviewer's supervisor 
felt the review was insufficiently rigorous and declined to sign off on it. 
</P>
<P>
The reviewer eventually left the agency. His review languished on an office 
shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never looked through it," said Dr. Rudolph Widmark, the next reviewing 
medical officer to be assigned the case. "It was a 600-page review, which I 
thought was a waste of time. You know, I have to construct my own way of 
looking at the data." 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s have not been happy times at the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Federal budget-cutting reduced full-time staff from about 8,000 in 1979 to less 
than 7,000 in 1986, according to congressional and FDA figures. Meanwhile, the 
number of applications to market new drugs rose from 182 in 1979 to 269 in 
1983, one internal study shows. 
</P>
<P>
The number of applications to begin testing new products skyrocketed -- from 
940 in 1979 to 1,904 in 1985. Applications to test AIDS products rose from five 
in 1982 to 60 in 1985 to 275 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA was and continues to be a lean organization," said John Norris, an 
executive vice president of Hill &amp; Knowlton, who served as FDA deputy 
commissioner between 1984 and 1988. "So right away, the cuts went into meat and 
bone, and not into fat." 
</P>
<P>
Morale suffered too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Dangers 
</P>
<P>
Until the arrival of FDA Commissioner Frank Young in 1984, tenure in the top 
job averaged just over one year. The post had become "unrewarding . . . 
politically dangerous . . . (and) a public target for ridicule," as Norris put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Travel budgets were so tight that, Norris said, "I often had to pay from my own 
pocket to cover government travel because meetings were held in expensive 
hotels and the government per diem doesn't cover a third of that." 
</P>
<P>
Pay for skilled professionals stands 30% to 500% below what the same people 
could earn in the private sector, Norris says. He recalls taking "a sixfold cut 
in pay" to come to the FDA from his job as chief executive officer of a 
management-consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you hire an ophthalmologist for $65,000 a year?" asked Jere Goyan, a 
former FDA commissioner who is now dean of the UC San Francisco School of 
Pharmacy. "That's petty cash for an ophthalmologist." 
</P>
<P>
In late 1985, the Voltaren application encountered yet another delay: The FDA 
and Ciba-Geigy decided to computerize the medical review. In the long run, the 
FDA hopes computerization will speed up the process; but in the Voltaren 
approval process, it devoured another year. 
</P>
<P>
It took the two sides four months to agree on terms for the new system. Then a 
consultant spent five months developing programs. By July, 1986, Ciba-Geigy had 
installed a terminal at FDA headquarters, giving the agency computer access to 
the company's data. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the company installed a fax machine in the FDA reviewers' office to 
speed up the review -- an arrangement FDA officials said may raise questions 
about propriety but proved expedient. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review in Earnest 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in late 1986, the medical review began in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
All through the following year, Widmark and his supervisor, Dr. John Harter, 
sorted through the Voltaren application. They re-examined data, scrutinized 
patient records, hunted out subtle side-effects. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, as Widmark worked with the data, he noticed an unexpected pattern in 
the way the drug affected patients' livers: The side-effects were worse in 
patients with osteoarthritis than in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
That finding prompted the agency to require an addition to the drug's labeling 
-- the elaborate description of a drug's chemistry, pharmacology, risks and 
proper use that goes to all prescribing physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Because such labeling also dictates how the drug may be advertised, companies 
take labeling issues seriously. They know that physicians, or a competing drug 
firm, might take an unusual warning as grounds for not prescribing the drug. 
</P>
<P>
After months of negotiation, the FDA and Ciba-Geigy agreed that the label would 
advise physicians to monitor the blood of patients on long-term Voltaren 
therapy. They were to test for certain enzymes whose presence can be a sign of 
liver injury. 
</P>
<P>
But the advice was undercut by the FDA's inability to specify when monitoring 
should be done. While the data from the drug's trials suggested that monitoring 
might help avert more serious liver problems, it was unclear how often patients 
needed to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
"We hated at this end to recommend monitoring too specifically when the data 
didn't really show how often we should tell them to monitor," Pease said. 
</P>
<P>
There is little agreement on precisely how the drug-approval process might be 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry officials would like to see the FDA less involved -- for example, 
in determining when it is appropriate to advance from animal to human testing. 
Cooper of Upjohn suggests local hospital review boards could ensure that human 
tests are ethical and safe. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including former FDA commissioner Goyan, want the agency to consider 
new statistical methods for extrapolating research findings to the general 
population. They wonder if it might be possible to test some drugs on fewer 
patients, saving time to approval. 
</P>
<P>
Some top cancer researchers say the FDA should use more liberal standards in 
judging whether drugs work. For example, must sponsors prove that a cancer drug 
prolongs survival, or simply that patients responded and some biological 
function was restored? 
</P>
<P>
The FDA, on the other hand, would like companies to turn in better 
applications. Commissioner Young likes to cite one that he calls "the epic 
application": Seven of nine studies supporting the drug in question were "of no 
value" in the review, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
But the agency has also made its own adjustments in recent months, under 
pressure in part from AIDS activists. The changes have included a commitment to 
allow drug testing to be shortened in the case of drugs for life-threatening 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts warn that there may be dangers in speeding up the process. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a risk in putting any drug on the market," said Dr. F. Gilbert 
McMahon, who headed a commission on the FDA in the early 1980s. "No drug is 
free of side-effects. Drugs are put on the market because their benefits seem 
to outweigh their risk. 
</P>
<P>
"So if you shorten the (trials) to 200 to 500 people before market, the public 
and the Congress have to know . . . that there are going to be some terrible 
mistakes," said McMahon. "They've got to be willing to accept that risk." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-April, 1988, all the FDA reviewers had largely completed their work on 
Voltaren. The next step was to present their written reports to Dr. Temple, the 
drug-evaluation office director with final say over when, and with what 
conditions, the drug would be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Harter proposed that the reviews be presented to Temple orally in a marathon 
one-day workshop. The plan was to avoid the perpetual pileup of so-called 
approval packages awaiting Temple's attention like aircraft waiting for 
permission to land. 
</P>
<P>
"Packages historically have idled for quite a while. It's fair to say, 
certainly, for months," said Pease. "What we tried to do was bring everybody 
into a room all at once and say, 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.' " 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five FDA officials convened at 9 a.m. on April 25 in a conference room 
on the 13th floor of the FDA building. Four floors below, in another conference 
room, a dozen Ciba-Geigy officials stood by to answer questions carried 
downstairs by runners. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting lasted 11 hours. The Ciba-Geigy contingent missed the last plane 
back to New Jersey. But the session was pronounced a success: After three more 
months of discussions, Voltaren was approved. 
</P>
<P>
On July 28, 1988, Voltaren's 55-month odyssey ended. The FDA formally approved 
the drug. Fengler and Ron Califre of Ciba-Geigy took the first flight from New 
Jersey to Washington to pick up a copy of the approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It's traditional," Califre explained of the final voyage. "It's like 
delivering a baby." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applications Up, Manpower Down 
</P>

rising in recent years , FDA manpower has been declining.

GINGRICH, RIGHT'S BAD BOY, TARGET OF ANGRY DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years he has been the bad boy of the Republican Right, the congressman 
whose roughhouse partisanship has delighted conservatives and enraged 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
But now, having led the crusade to topple Speaker Jim Wright, Rep. Newt 
Gingrich of Georgia is on the defensive, beset by many of the forces he helped 
set in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, who rode the ethics issue to become assistant House Republican 
leader, is battling charges that, like Wright, he profited unethically from a 
book deal financed by campaign contributors. He is also trying to contain the 
controversy over an aide's alleged role in spreading unsubstantiated rumors of 
homosexuality about Rep. Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), who replaced Wright as 
Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Newt has made a career out of attacking people around here and trying to rip 
them apart," said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), a liberal who has clashed 
bitterly with Gingrich. "Now the shoe is on the other foot. He's going to have 
to answer for a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy is nothing new to Gingrich, 45, who has crusaded passionately 
against the "corruption" of Democratic House leaders since he was first elected 
to the House in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when most of his GOP colleagues were resigned to their minority 
status, he and other young conservatives went on the offensive, launching a 
spirited campaign to keep the rhetorical heat on Democrats and lay the 
foundation for an eventual Republican majority in the House. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Gingrich earned a reputation for slashing, personal attacks and 
an ideological intensity that borders on evangelism. When he blasted Democratic 
foreign policy in a 1983 House speech, critics charged that he was questioning 
their patriotism in the manner of the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy. Former 
Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. called it "the lowest thing" he had seen in 
32 years on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as Gadfly 
</P>
<P>
Despite his steady attacks, opponents at first viewed Gingrich as a political 
gadfly. But they took notice this year when the ethics charges he filed against 
Wright resulted in the Speaker's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"None of this would have happened without Newt, and that's the reason why 
there's so much resentment out there," said Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.), a strong 
Gingrich supporter. "He did something no one believed he could do, but that's 
been typical of his career. He's just unbelievably persistent in getting what 
he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the ethics controversy continuing to dominate Congress, the spotlight 
has turned on Gingrich himself. Some Republicans predict he may come in for the 
same kind of scrutiny that ultimately destroyed Wright. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of Democrats are gunning for Newt, no question," said one 
moderate Republican, who asked not to be identified. "He's going to come under 
the microscope." 
</P>
<P>
For once, Gingrich seems uncomfortable with all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the victim of a hypocritical, one-sided morality," he said in an 
interview. "I've been the whistle-blower, because I helped bring a man (Wright) 
who was a scoundrel to justice, and now I'm being punished for this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impatient With Inquiries 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, whose pudgy face is framed by a helmet of thick gray hair, added that 
he has little patience with the questions that have been dogging him lately. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of being smeared," he snapped. "I'm tired of Democrats bashing me 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Partisan politics has been Gingrich's passion all his adult life. He lived on 
military bases around the world as a child before his family settled at Ft. 
Benning, Ga., and received a graduate degree in European history from Emory 
University in Atlanta, but he was soon attracted to politics. He managed a 
congressional campaign in 1964 and worked on Nelson A. Rockefeller's southeast 
presidential campaign in 1968. He taught history and geography at West Georgia 
College and, after two losses, was finally elected to Congress in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
His sixth two-year term has been his most controversial. Gingrich came under 
new fire just last week when it was learned that Karen Van Brocklin, an aide in 
his office, had spread sexual rumors about Foley to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stupidly Said Yes' 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Gingrich insisted that Van Brocklin had merely been asked by a 
reporter if there were stories circulating about Foley's personal life, "and 
she stupidly said yes." He said it was wrong for her to have talked with the 
press, but he did not criticize her for disseminating the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Several reporters offered a different account. Speaking not for attribution, 
they said she had brought up the subject of Foley's alleged behavior with at 
least three news organizations and had tried to get them to publish stories on 
the subject by claiming other newspapers were about to do so. No such story was 
ever published. 
</P>
<P>
The episode infuriated Democrats. "This is a new low for him," said Rep. Beryl 
Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. "He's engaged in personal attacks before, but I can't remember 
anything quite this bad." 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich later apologized to Foley but refused Democratic demands that he fire 
Van Brocklin. Instead, he instructed her not to talk with the press again. 
</P>
<P>
"That's quite a punishment he handed out," said Frank. "Newt has gotten 
intoxicated with this kind of stuff. It's pure sleaze." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Coelho Incident 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said the story has been blown out of proportion. Changing the subject, 
he recalled that House Majority Whip Tony Coelho of Merced had circulated to 
his colleagues a 1984 magazine article about the breakup of Gingrich's first 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall any Democrats demanding an apology when that happened," he said 
tartly. "All of this is nothing but cheap partisanship." 
</P>
<P>
The effort to spread rumors about Foley created a backlash that claimed one 
victim. Mark Goodin resigned as communications director of the Republican 
National Committee after admitting that he wrote a memo criticizing Foley as 
"out of the liberal closet" and compared his voting record with that of Frank, 
an acknowledged homosexual. Republicans from President Bush down publicly 
deplored the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Foley incident showed signs of receding by week's end, Gingrich 
has had no such luck with the controversy over his 1984 book, "Window of 
Opportunity," which showcased his conservative views. He and his wife, 
Marianne, used a highly unusual scheme to raise promotional funds for the book, 
which was co-authored by the Gingriches and a third writer. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that their publisher had only modest plans to market the book, 
Marianne Gingrich formed a limited partnership to finance a $105,000 marketing 
campaign, according to documents made available by the congressman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Donors 
</P>
<P>
The group was made up of 21 investors, including politically influential 
campaign donors in Gingrich's district, who contributed $5,000 each. Gingrich, 
although not a partner himself, solicited a $5,000 contribution from at least 
one of the supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The book was not an enormous commercial success -- it has sold about 29,000 
copies so far -- and investors who had been promised a share of the profits 
instead received tax-deductible losses. 
</P>
<P>
But the Gingriches came away with more than $35,000. Under the agreement, 
Marianne Gingrich was paid $11,500 for helping to establish and operate the 
partnership. For writing the book, Gingrich and his wife each got a $5,000 
advance and $7,018 in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats charged that Gingrich was guilty of the same sort of actions that he 
had criticized Wright for in conjunction with his book, "Reflections of a 
Public Man." 
</P>
<P>
The House Ethics Committee accused Wright of making $57,000 in royalties from 
his book to circumvent the congressional limits on fees for speaking or writing 
articles. Book royalties are exempt from these limits, and the former Speaker 
was found to have sold his book in bulk to special-interest groups that heard 
his speeches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gifts Key Issue 
</P>
<P>
Wright was also accused of accepting gifts from a Ft. Worth businessman, George 
A. Mallick Jr., at a time when Mallick had a direct interest in legislation. 
Mallick allegedly funneled income to Wright in the form of salary payments to 
his wife. Wright announced his resignation as Speaker and as a House member 
before the charges could go before the full House. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.) raised similar accusations against Gingrich when 
he filed charges in April with the Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said Gingrich's book payments did not qualify as royalties but 
represented an attempt to evade limits on outside income. He also contended 
that the $105,000 in investments could be construed as gifts from people who 
had a direct interest in legislation before Congress. Finally, he said the 
salary paid to Gingrich's wife could be viewed as an attempt to funnel money to 
Gingrich himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citizens Lobby 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause, the citizens lobby that had raised charges against Wright, asked 
the House Ethics Committee to appoint an outside counsel to check into 
Gingrich's book deal, much as a special counsel had investigated Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich was incensed by the charges. In a heated press conference last month, 
during which his wife ran from the room in tears, he said his book deal was 
unusual but not illegal. He produced documents showing that his wife had earned 
her salary. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of his defense, however, was that investors in the book deal got no 
special treatment from him and knew they were involved in a straight business 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the people . . . who are investors have received any unusual 
involvement, have received any unusual care on my part," he said. "These 
investors came when the publisher didn't have the total resources to adequately 
promote the book and get if off the ground. . . . This arrangement was worked 
to raise money." 
</P>
<P>
Among the investors, Gregor Peterson, a Lake Tahoe investor, said that he 
contributed because he liked Gingrich's conservative philosophy, but that he 
also expected a profit. But Joseph Bigard of Bigard Oil &amp; Manufacturing in 
Newton, Ill., said he viewed his $5,000 contribution not as an investment but 
as an endorsement of Gingrich's views. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enlighten the People' 
</P>
<P>
"I looked on it as a political contribution and money spent to enlighten the 
American people on a different approach," he said in an interview with the 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich initially tried to brush off questions about whether the investors had 
a stake in legislation. He later conceded that some of them did, but he 
stressed that he had done nothing on their behalf that he would not have done 
for any other constituents. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the congressman said he would look out for the interests of 
Southwire Corp., a wire producer that employs 3,000 people in his district, 
even if James Richards, a company executive, had not been not among the 
investors. "I would be derelict in my duties if I did not," Gingrich said. 
"Southwire automatically has my attention every morning." 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee has yet to act on the complaints filed against Gingrich. 
Democrats do not intend to let them fade away. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to treat him fairly," said Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.). "But 
I certainly want them to treat him."

400 ARRESTED AS CHINA GEARS UP TO CHOKE OFF DISSENT

<TEXT>
<P>
As China's sophisticated apparatus of repression geared up to reassert strict 
political controls, state-run television announced Saturday the arrests in 
Beijing of more than 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
Additional arrests were made elsewhere of protesters who fled the capital after 
last weekend's martial-law crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, according 
to the television report. These came in surrounding Hebei province, the cities 
of Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other locations, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were accused of burning military vehicles, destroying other 
government property, beating soldiers, stealing weapons, attacking government 
agencies or spreading rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, China carried out its first expulsion of a foreign journalist 
since the current crisis began, and authorities launched a harsh verbal attack 
on the Voice of America, a key source of information about events here for many 
Chinese listeners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Propaganda Barrage 
</P>
<P>
In a heavy propaganda barrage that began several days ago, the official media 
outlets are portraying last weekend's bloody crackdown, which ended seven weeks 
of escalating pro-democracy protests, as a response to violent 
"counterrevolutionary" rioting. 
</P>
<P>
This reverses the actual order of events. The weeks of pro-democracy 
demonstrations, which began in mid-April, were nonviolent and usually festive. 
</P>
<P>
The rioting, which involved heavy destruction of military vehicles and the 
killing of some soldiers, came as a response to the deaths of hundreds or 
perhaps thousands of unarmed people in Beijing as martial-law troops, using 
automatic weapons and tanks, moved into the city a week ago Saturday night and 
the next morning to clear protesters from Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Most deaths were of Beijing citizens who poured into the streets to try to 
block the military assault on the square. A large majority of the several 
thousand students who remained in the center of the square through the pre-dawn 
hours Sunday -- and perhaps nearly all of them -- were allowed to leave shortly 
before dawn. They left the southern side of the square and dispersed through 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign correspondents in Beijing generally remain uncertain about what 
happened in the northern part of the huge square during the final half-hour 
before dawn, as it appears that no foreigner was able to fully witness events 
in the area during that critical period. Chinese who claim to be eyewitnesses 
give conflicting reports about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
What is absolutely clear is that hundreds of unarmed citizens were killed on 
the western side of the city as advancing troops fought their way through 
crowds, and that at least several dozen people were shot and killed on Changan 
Avenue, at the north side of the square, during the early morning hours Sunday 
before the protesters at the center of the square were forced south. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Red Cross initially reported that night's death toll as 2,600, and 
estimates widely circulated within the diplomatic community put the figure at 
3,000 or more. The Chinese government, however, now insists that only about 300 
people died and that the majority were soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that proof of the true figures will never be obtained. Bodies have 
already been cremated, and for Chinese to claim that the government figures are 
wrong is now the martial-law crime of "spreading rumors." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the destroyed military vehicles, including armored personnel carriers, 
were abandoned during the day Sunday by troops presumed at the time to be 
unwilling to kill unarmed citizens. It now appears that the vehicles may have 
been ordered abandoned for the purpose of obtaining dramatic videotapes of 
destruction by supposed counterrevolutionaries. These videotapes are now being 
repeatedly shown on state-run television. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Propaganda Barrage 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, it appears that few people believe the government line. But the 
current propaganda barrage may have a strong influence on people in outlying 
provinces. Even for those who know the government reports are false, it has 
become dangerous to publicly deny them. There are also severe, but somewhat 
ambiguous, restrictions on foreign reporting on events in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Some journalists were shot or beaten while covering the army's move into Tian 
An Men Square last weekend, but none were killed or critically injured. In 
recent days, authorities have issued vague warnings to foreigners that appear 
aimed in part at chilling news coverage of the current wave of arrests. Some 
correspondents have been issued specific warnings that they have violated 
martial-law rules. But there has not been any concerted effort to impose a 
genuine news blackout on the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Peter Newport, a journalist with London-based Independent 
Television News, was ordered out of China after trying to cover a student 
protest in Shanghai, according to reports from that coastal city. 
</P>
<P>
An ITN spokesman in London told Reuters news agency that police destroyed 
Newport's videocassettes and gave him 24 hours to leave China. He later arrived 
in Hong Kong, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourist Visa 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that the pretext on which Newport was expelled was that he was 
working on a tourist visa, according to reports from Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
The government also issued harsh criticism Saturday of the Voice of America, 
which beams English- and Chinese-language broadcasts to China. A letter said to 
have been written by an unidentified teacher accused the radio station of false 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
"The teacher described the report by Voice of America as irresponsible, saying 
that it aimed at instigating hatred and resistance," the official New China 
News Agency said in a report. The letter was also published in the official 
People's Daily newspaper and broadcast on state-run radio. 
</P>
<P>
One of the martial-law press restrictions is that "Chinese or foreign 
journalists are strictly forbidden to utilize press coverage to make 
instigating and inciting propaganda." The wording of the letter thus appeared 
aimed at preparing the groundwork for some sort of action against Voice of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Another VOA attack came during the evening television news. A man identified as 
a "rumormonger" was shown telling a foreign reporter and a small crowd of 
listeners that martial-law troops had crushed and beaten people to death. He 
first claimed to be an eyewitness, but then changed his story to say that he 
had heard it on Voice of America. The scene concludes with the narrator 
declaring: "We hope the people will turn in rumormongers like him." 
</P>
<P>
The television news announcement on the arrests in Beijing reported that among 
those detained was student leader Guo Haifeng. According to the report, he was 
arrested at Tian An Men Square when he was about to use a gasoline-filled 
bottle to try to set fire to an armored car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vigilant Residents 
</P>
<P>
News announcers said that some student leaders had given themselves up or had 
been turned in by vigilant residents of Beijing who answered a request to phone 
in the whereabouts of "inciters of the counterrevolutionary rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast showed some of the detainees being led at gunpoint by a phalanx 
of police into interrogation cells. Their heads were forced down by guards in a 
ritual display of submission. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, they sat forlornly in a corner, evidently giving self-incriminating 
evidence to a pair of note takers. Then they were handcuffed and led away. 
</P>
<P>
The media have identified most of those arrested simply as "ruffians" and 
lawbreakers, and it is not clear how many are students. But it appears that 
many, if not most, of those arrested so far are not students. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were viewed by foreign observers as a sign that government power 
had been consolidated, at least for the moment. The night before, senior leader 
Deng Xiaoping appeared on television in the company of hard-line conservative 
leaders and a flock of army generals. Saturday's edition of the People's Daily, 
the official Communist Party newspaper, and every other paper in the city 
published a front-page picture of Deng alone shaking hands with army officers. 
</P>
<P>
"The message seemed to be that this is the man who controls the guns," said a 
Western diplomat, referring to the photo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fall From Grace 
</P>
<P>
Nothing has been heard of reformist leader Zhao Ziyang, who is technically 
still the head of the Communist Party but who fell from grace for sympathizing 
with student demands and opposing the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the arrests seemed to be carried out by combined police-army sweeps 
in neighborhoods in Beijing. Soldiers have fanned out to all neighborhoods of 
the city, converting what was once martial law in word only into a very visible 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
The government has taken pains to get the city back to normal after a week of 
chaos, but most residents remained indoors. Bus service was renewed on a 
limited basis, and many shops and factories remained closed. Most roads were 
cleared of debris left from the popular resistance to the army's move on the 
square. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the wave of arrests and the more widespread positioning of martial-law 
troops -- who stood 50 feet apart along some stretches of major roads and 
engaged in foot patrols through other areas -- the random shootings of the past 
few days subsided and it seemed reasonably safe Saturday to move through the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Tian An Men Square, however, was blocked off except for city bus traffic 
allowed to pass through its northern side along Changan Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians and bicyclists who passed the southern side of the square gawked at 
10 tanks parked to face them, but they were quickly shooed along by armed 
soldiers if they paused too long. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voice of Anguish 
</P>
<P>
"Why did they have to do this?" one Chinese bicyclist said with anguish in her 
voice as she passed the square. "It was perfectly peaceful on June 3." 
</P>
<P>
Short convoys of empty troop trucks, usually about five vehicles long, moved 
out of the city Saturday afternoon bearing banners declaring "People's 
Liberation Army rice-for-the-people transport team." By early evening, the same 
or similar trucks, apparently laden with supplies for the troops still 
occupying Tian An Men Square, were parked behind the Great Hall of the People, 
which faces the square. 
</P>
<P>
Parked in the main part of the square Saturday evening were about 50 tanks and 
about 300 apparently empty troop transport trucks. Soldiers armed with 
automatic rifles stood guard at the four corners of the square, while a few 
tanks and armored personnel carriers were positioned at two locations outside 
but near the square. 
</P>
<P>
A group of about 90 Americans were bused from the coastal city of Tianjin to 
Beijing in a U.S. Embassy convoy, with the intention that they would 
immediately leave the country from Beijing airport on a special flight. The 
flight was delayed, however, for reasons that were not clear. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic motorcade from Beijing had to leave one American couple behind. 
The two had not completed the final legal formality for adoption of their 
Chinese-born infant, and under U.S. law it was impossible to issue the child a 
visa. 
</P>
<P>
Another evacuee, Don Wycoff, a 39-year-old research chemist from St. Louis, 
said repression of the student pro-democracy movement would cost China a whole 
generation of future leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese haven't had this kind of repression before," Wycoff said. "Before, 
it was political repression, with mass movements and all that. This time it was 
sheer force by the police and army. It will take 15 years to repair the damage 
-- at least." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing organized the motorcade to take the foreigners to 
Beijing, where they could catch flights out of the country, after U.S. business 
people stationed in Tianjin were unable to arrange transportation. John P. 
Cragin, president of Management Technologies International Inc., a 
Tianjin-based consulting firm, said the Americans were refused a special 
flight, and when buses were privately chartered Thursday, police barred the 
drivers from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt trapped here," said Cragin, whose home is in Los Angeles. "They 
wouldn't even let us on an empty plane." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's television news showed Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong addressing a 
meeting and calling for a moment of silence to honor the soldiers and police 
officers who died during the assault on the square. He also accused those who 
resisted the troops of having engaged in rioting.

FANG HAS LONG BEEN THORN IN SIDE OF CHINA'S REGIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Given the exceptional boldness of Fang Lizhi, the dissident Chinese 
astrophysicist who took refuge in the American Embassy last week, it is not 
surprising that he is on the run now -- but rather that he did not go into 
hiding long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Even considering that he was once a protege of reformists in power, Fang had 
long exceeded the usual bounds of public protest in China. 
</P>
<P>
He had tweaked the tolerance of high officials by saying out loud what many 
Chinese whisper: that top leaders have large foreign bank accounts. He 
dismissed Marxism as passe and suggested that Taiwan, ruled by the heirs of the 
Nationalist government that fled the mainland after the Communist triumph of 
1949, should be the model for development on the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Fang had gone so far as to lead a drive to free political prisoners, a subject 
rarely raised in China. The government denies there are any such prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
By fleeing into the embassy along with his wife, Li Shuxian, Fang evidently 
wants to avoid the fate of the dissidents he had hoped to free. 
</P>
<P>
The police are moving to round up student and worker activists who took part in 
the protests at Tian An Men Square. Increasingly, intellectuals such as Fang 
believe that they too are about to be swept into a net of repression. Soldiers 
have surrounded the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, where many reformist 
scholars work. Teachers at several universities believe they may be called to 
account for pro-democracy sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
"They're out for blood," said a young university instructor who had taken part 
in the recent pro-democracy demonstrations. "They want total vengeance. It's 
not safe for me to stay in Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
Fang himself was not directly involved in the occupation of Tian An Men Square 
by students, although his wife -- a Beijing University physics professor -- 
made speeches on campus in the weeks leading up to the unrest. Some student 
leaders pointed to him as an inspiration. One, Wang Dan, an activist at Beijing 
University and a key leader in the protests, said he is a personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint to the U.S. Embassy for having granted refuge to Fang, the 
Chinese government labeled the scientist a "traitor," which is tantamount to 
being given a death sentence in China. 
</P>
<P>
China's aging paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, reportedly said of Fang last 
fall: "We will not suppress people who hold differing political views from our 
own. But Fang Lizhi has been indulging in mudslinging and spreading slander 
without any basis, and we should take criminal action against him." 
</P>
<P>
Fang, 53, was the center of a diplomatic storm during President Bush's visit to 
China earlier this spring. Bush had invited Fang to a dinner along with other 
Chinese notables and government officials. The police blocked Fang's way, and 
he never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
By criticizing China's government, Fang is playing a role out of China's 
history and lore: that of the virtuous government monitor whose duty it is to 
call to account the emperor -- even at the risk of his own life. This role has 
been picked up by numerous Chinese intellectuals in the 40 years of Communist 
Party rule, with often turbulent results. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, during the Hundred Flowers Movement, Mao Tse-tung called on 
intellectuals to "bloom and contend" in criticizing government performance. The 
surge of political candor went sour. Mao turned on the same critics he had 
invited to step forward, persecuting them in what was called the Anti-Rightist 
Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stinking' Category 
</P>
<P>
During the Cultural Revolution, intellectuals were branded a "stinking" 
category of Chinese society. Mao condemned them as "being basically bourgeois 
in their world outlook," and many of the country's top intellects were banished 
to the countryside, beaten or even killed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the conflict in the Communist Party over intellectual freedom is being 
played out again. As tools in development, must China's best educated minds be 
left unfettered? Or are the intellectual elites untrustworthy carriers of 
foreign political viruses aimed at weakening the Communist system? 
</P>
<P>
Disgraced Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, while stopping short of endorsing 
calls for political reform that would undermine Communist rule, nonetheless 
sponsored greater freedom for the intellectuals. His opponents, including 
Premier Li Peng, want tighter reins imposed in the name of warding off 
"bourgeois liberalization" and "spiritual pollution." 
</P>
<P>
Fang has gone much further than the reformers in his calls for change. He has 
also taken a theoretical position that puts him in conflict with Marxist dogma, 
the underpinning of one-party rule here. He says that intellectuals are the 
leading force in society, not the working class and certainly not the Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Fang was dismissed from his job as vice president of the University of 
Science and Technology in Hefei, in Anhui province, as well as from the 
Communist Party. The government blamed him and a few other dissidents for 
inciting a series of student democracy protests in Hefei, Shanghai and other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Fang was given a non-teaching post at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 
Beijing, but he kept speaking out in ways rarely heard since 1979, when an 
earlier wave of democratic agitation swept China's cities. 
</P>
<P>
A listing of just a few of Fang Lizhi's thoughts indicate his unorthodoxy: 
</P>
<P>
On Marxism: "I feel Marxism is out of date." 
</P>
<P>
On the Communist Party: "The Chinese Communist Party is an interest group which 
will inevitably and firmly protect its vested interests and will never 
voluntarily give up these interests or voluntarily take the road of 
democratization." 
</P>
<P>
On China's development: "China will not be able to modernize if it does not 
break the shackles of Maoist and Stalinist-style socialism." 
</P>
<P>
On government corruption and secret bank accounts: "I do not know how big some 
of our comrades' foreign bank accounts are. Some of the bank accounts are the 
privately acquired middlemen's money, the fruits of corruption and fraud. This 
is a criminal act." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Basic Trust' 
</P>
<P>
On the mood in China (before the Tian An Men incident): "The situation is very 
dangerous. There is no basic trust in the government, the law or party." 
</P>
<P>
On intellectual leadership: "Generally speaking, people who have internalized 
the elements of civilization and possess knowledge have hearts which are 
relatively noble, their mode of thought is invariably scientific and they have 
a high sense of social responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
On human rights: "Human rights means everyone has the right to think. You can't 
say China's freedom of speech is different from foreign countries' freedom of 
speech. Freedom of speech is the same everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
On the building democracy: "Democracy can be achieved only gradually through 
consistent effort. There is nothing to be afraid of." 
</P>
<P>
At least nothing until last Sunday.

POPE WHO HAS STIRRED THE WORLD CAUSED LITTLE ADO IN SCANDINAVIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
VADSTENA, Sweden 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a gentle spring rain, this picture-book town dominated by a medieval castle 
offered a by-now familiar tableau Saturday. A few townspeople came with 
youngsters from across Scandinavia to pray with the Bishop of Rome. Most 
ignored him. 
</P>
<P>
Thus ended, as it began, one of the most unusual of Pope John Paul II's 42 
trips abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar white-robed figure, whose mere presence has paralyzed cities 
around the world, caused scarcely a stir as he swept through five Nordic 
countries. No traffic jams, hardly any crowds, empty pews at Mass. 
</P>
<P>
On the last day of a visit to Sweden, John Paul made the front page in one of 
Stockholm's major morning newspaper's -- but Page 8 in the other one. Still, to 
hear the Pope's aides tell it, nobody expected big crowds, and the visit didn't 
turn on them. 
</P>
<P>
"The visit exceeded expectations both in the Holy Father's spiritual encounters 
with Catholic minorities and his ecumenical reception by leaders of the 
Lutheran Church," said papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro as the pontiff's party 
returned to Rome on Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Go to Bring the Gospel' 
</P>
<P>
Neither, said the Pope himself, did numbers concern him. "I don't go to attract 
the masses," John Paul told reporters on his plane after a visit early in his 
tour with Iceland's 1,800 Roman Catholics. "I go to bring the Gospel everywhere 
there are Catholics. I also go to those who are not Catholics, especially when 
there are Christians." 
</P>
<P>
For five countries, 10 days and 38 speeches, John Paul traveled through Nordic 
nations where people exhibit socialist indifference not only to his Roman 
Catholic Church but also to their own official Lutheran Church. 
</P>
<P>
There are barely enough Catholics in all of Scandinavia to fill St. Peter's 
Square -- about 200,000 in all -- and hardly enough practicing Lutherans to 
keep warm the rock-ribbed, Gothic-spired churches that are landmarks of most 
towns. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, in the trip's aftermath, Scandinavian Catholics and Lutherans alike 
can claim something to show for the papal passage. So, for that matter, can the 
awesomely organized and unfailingly polite Scandinavian governments that 
welcomed John Paul with more efficiency than affection. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of those crass materialists the Pope likes to revile were left with 
fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promotion for Seafood 
</P>
<P>
"The Pope Sells Fish!" exalted a headline in Tromso, Norway, which is as close 
to the North Pole as any newspaper gets -- or any Pope has ever been. Einar 
Sorensen, a Tromso exporter, had a particular pontifical perspective: "This is 
unique occasion for promoting the seafood industry." 
</P>
<P>
In Denmark, a brewery bought ads showing a papal skull cap on a table and you 
know who's hand reaching for a cold beer. 
</P>
<P>
"The papal visit is a marketing operation of the Catholic Church," said the 
Finnish newspaper Kausan Uutiset. "Still, it is a better crusade than the one 
in 1160, when Swedish King Henry IX invaded to convert us to Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
Across the region, government leaders welcomed the Pope as a fellow crusader 
for human rights and social justice around the world. 
</P>
<P>
There was less echo, public or private, for the Pope's no-compromise Catholic 
teachings in countries that are among the most liberal in the world on issues 
of personal morality such as abortion, contraception and sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
A columnist in Stockholm's conservative Svenska Dagbladet complained that the 
Vatican reacts to critics of its ban against artificial birth control "as if 
they were attacking the very basis of Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
To his own minority church in Scandinavia, John Paul preached solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
"Always remember that even the most isolated Catholics are not alone," he said 
at one drizzly provincial outpost in Denmark. "The smallest of your communities 
in the north is still part of the universal church." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promise of Reunification 
</P>
<P>
To Lutherans, John Paul promised eventual reunification of churches split in 
blood by the Reformation. Indeed, in the Vatican view, the audacity of the trip 
and its principle achievement lay in its ecumenical dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, John Paul met leaders of the Lutheran Church, which has 69 million 
members in 85 countries and bedrock roots in Scandinavia. Catholics and 
Lutherans have been at odds for nearly all of the time since Martin Luther's 
16th-Century revolt from a corrupt and venal Roman church. 
</P>
<P>
"After 400 years of separation, time is needed for the process of 
reconciliation and healing to take place," John Paul said in an ecumenical 
address at Uppsala University attended by 15 Lutheran bishops. "Not everything 
can be done at once, but we must do what we can today with hope for what may be 
possible tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, papal rhetoric was carefully couched for Lutheran sensibilities. 
His usual lofty titles like Supreme Pontiff and Vicar of Christ remained at 
home. In Scandinavia, John Paul was, simply, the Bishop of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
In Denmark, where Lutheran bishops would not let him speak in an ecumenical 
meeting, the Pope sat in reverential silence. 
</P>
<P>
If the Pope's moral message was as rigid as ever, he was calculatingly more 
euphemistic in expressing it to members of a church that has no problem with 
contraception, divorce -- or women priests. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the papal gesture, the Stockholm paper Dagens Nyheter observed: "Whether 
he respects other people's views, particularly Lutherans, is something to 
ponder. Unfortunately, he handles his own church in a roughshod way, but he has 
to approach other churches with much more humility." 
</P>
<P>
John Paul rules out common communion with the Lutherans and other Protestants 
until there is what he calls "a common faith." 
</P>
<P>
"The Pope has very clear ecumenical commitment, but he's going too slow," said 
Jonas Jonson, the Lutheran bishop of Strangnas, Sweden.

BHUTTO SWEEPS OUT -- AND LEAVES 'EM DAZZLED 
</P>

She out-toasted Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in Boston. Her speech to Congress 
brought the tough, conservative New Hampshire Republican Sen. Gordon J. 
Humphrey to tears. And she charmed a beaming former President Richard M. Nixon 
during a private chat at the Waldorf Towers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Pakistan's 35-year-old Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto left for home 
Saturday night after a whirlwind, five-day state visit to the nation where she 
spent her college years, Bhutto left behind much more than impressions of 
glamour, wit and charm. 
</P>
<P>
The visit by the new leader of one of America's most strategic allies in Asia 
has led to a significant shift in both countries' policies on war-torn 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
In less than a week, Bhutto also created a new symbol here for the Islamic 
religion at a time when the radicalism and influence of the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini appears to be on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aid Hike Seems Certain 
</P>
<P>
And the visit, which has virtually assured increases in the more than $600 
million in American economic and military aid already committed to a country 
that ranks as the third-largest U.S. aid recipient, has helped strengthen 
Bhutto's hand at home. There, she continues to face strident opposition from 
heavily financed religious and political conservative groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it can be termed a very, very successful visit for many reasons," said 
Zulfikar Ali Khan, a Bhutto adviser who will become ambassador to Washington in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the renewed U.S. support is very important, not only because the 
economic and military assistance is necessary to strengthen our new democracy 
but because America controls the major international lending institutions. But 
the basic strength still comes from within Pakistan." 
</P>
<P>
And in Pakistan today, as it was for Bhutto throughout last week, one of the 
most critical issues is Afghanistan. The faltering military campaign of the 
U.S.- and Pakistani-backed Islamic rebels after the Soviet Union withdrew the 
last of its troops in February has forced serious rethinking in Washington and 
Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
During her 50-minute, one-on-one meeting with President Bush in the Oval Office 
last Tuesday, it was Bhutto who took the initiative, according to several 
senior Pakistani officials. And the result, in Zulfikar's words, was "a very 
significant shift" in the overall Afghan strategy of the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
In an official East Room ceremony after the meeting, the two leaders announced 
only that they had agreed to commit themselves to a political solution to the 
Afghan war, while continuing to provide the huge arms, transport and food 
shipments that have helped the moujahedeen rebels in their "holy war" against 
the Red Army and the Soviet-backed troops of the Kabul regime. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, though, aides to both leaders indicated that the two 
countries have now agreed that such a settlement should include a far more 
broadly based government than the fundamentalist-dominated rebel government in 
exile that was created last February in Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Include Marxists 
</P>
<P>
Zulfikar speculated that a new interim government now could even include 
members of the ruling, pro-Moscow People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, 
providing the party itself is removed, along with Afghanistan's Soviet-backed 
President Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever they might say about Marxism and Leninism, they have a very strong 
sense of nationhood in them first and foremost," he said of the party. "And if 
they think there's a chance of setting up a truly popular government, they 
might just say, 'For the sake of Afghanistan, enough . . . bloodshed.' 
</P>
<P>
"For us, it is a very, very major problem, because what happens if there is a 
(worsening) civil war there? There will be a huge new influx of refugees. And 
no one is prepared to handle that." 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan already is suffering under the weight of 3.5 million Afghan refugees, 
who have crossed Afghanistan's eastern border since the Soviet invasion in 
1979, and the Pakistani government is deeply concerned about "compassion 
fatigue," which it fears will greatly reduce the international refugee aid 
coming into Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Zulfikar conceded, however, that the new political approach to Afghanistan is 
likely to be met with resentment among the fundamentalists who now dominate the 
rebel alliance, which was forged largely by the United States and Pakistan 
years ago as a conduit for arms and humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Their voice won't be as strong as it is today," he said. "But they also have 
to realize just how urgent this problem really is." 
</P>
<P>
There were other substantial gains from the visit, which was diminished only 
because of the China crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's bid to acquire 60 F-16 jet fighters -- a $1.4-billion purchase that 
several congressmen had challenged because they felt the Afghan war is winding 
down -- as well as other military equipment is now all but certain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assured on Nuclear Program 
</P>
<P>
And key leaders in Congress, which also was considering blocking Pakistan's 
request for sophisticated antitank weaponry, indicated they will not only 
approve the Bush Administration's request but also will accept the President's 
expected certification that Pakistan is not building a nuclear weapon -- a 
denial that Bhutto stressed over and over throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
Such successes are certain to strengthen Bhutto's support in the powerful 
Pakistan military, which has ruled the country for 26 of its 41 years through 
coups and martial-law regimes -- among them that of the late Zia ul-Haq, who 
overthrew Bhutto's father in 1977 and sanctioned his execution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'New Toys' for Army 
</P>
<P>
"With all these new toys for the army, it necessarily bolsters her position," 
said one Pakistani political analyst. 
</P>
<P>
During a Friday night speech to the Asia Society in New York, in which Bhutto 
detailed the economic disaster in her country, she stressed again and again her 
commitment to privatization and capitalism -- a departure from the socialist 
leanings of her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the audience of wealthy business people that 
"Pakistan's social and demographic indicators are among the poorest in the 
world" -- a nation of 100 million with an astronomical 3% birthrate, where only 
a third have access to clean water, 17% have access to medical facilities, 74% 
are illiterate and life expectancy is just 54 years. And she told the group 
that only private investment can save Pakistan.

QUAYLE, IN SALVADOR VISIT, WILL MEET 2 LEFTIST LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the first such contact by a senior U.S. official, Vice President Dan Quayle 
will meet in El Salvador this week with two leaders of that country's left-wing 
opposition, Administration officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president leaves Washington today on a journey now seen as even more 
important in the wake of Friday's assassination of a senior Salvadoran 
official. 
</P>
<P>
The killing of Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, a right-wing ideologue who served 
as minister of the presidency -- in effect, chief of staff to President Alfredo 
Cristiani -- brings added urgency to the message Quayle is carrying of 
reconciliation in El Salvador and of respect for human rights by the rightist 
Cristiani administration, which took office June 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Visibility 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, said a White House official, "it elevates the visibility of 
the trip and adds further proof to our long-held proposition that these people 
(the killers) are not interested in democracy -- that they're interested in 
violence and murder." 
</P>
<P>
The Cristiani government, El Salvador's armed forces and U.S. Ambassador 
William G. Walker all blamed the Marxist Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front for Rodriguez Porth's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
They said guerrillas of the front are trying to elicit a violent right-wing 
reaction that could endanger the large U.S. aid program to El Salvador. The 
country receives more than $1 million a day in U.S. assistance, equal to 
one-third of the Salvadoran national budget. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle will meet in El Salvador with Guillermo Ungo and Ruben Zamora, senior 
officials of the Revolutionary Democratic Front, the civilian, political arm of 
the FLMN, as the guerrilla front is known. Ungo and Zamora were denied visas to 
visit this country five years ago by the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But Ungo and Zamora, more moderate than their contemporaries in the FMLN, have 
been urging the guerrillas to engage in negotiations and have on occasion 
publicly opposed some of the rebel acts branded as terrorist by the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The two politicians also took part in El Salvador's presidential elections this 
spring, in which their coalition received about 6% of the vote. That 
participation was a factor in the Bush Administration's decision to have Quayle 
meet with them. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials, sensitive to any suggestion that the Bush Administration 
might be conferring legitimacy on allies of the guerrillas, said that a failure 
to recognize Ungo's and Zamora's participation in the elections would leave the 
Administration open to criticism that it is not truly interested in pluralism 
in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
With Cristiani now beginning a five-year term, Quayle has an opportunity to 
show support for him and remind the armed forces and the government that "the 
spotlight is on them and that they'll have to make progress in human rights, 
because critics are watching for any sign of retrogression and will use that to 
endanger aid," the White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to El Salvador, Quayle will visit Guatemala, Honduras and Costa 
Rica before his scheduled return to Washington on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
During the other stops, Quayle will seek to put pressure on the Sandinista 
government of Nicaragua to adhere to its pledge to hold free and fair elections 
and to end its role in the shipment of Cuban and Soviet Bloc arms to the 
Salvadoran guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
He will also seek to reinforce the efforts by the Organization of American 
States to put pressure on Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega to relinquish 
power.

U.S. TO QUIZ MONK ON REPORTS OF POWS

The United States is sending a military attache to interview a Japanese monk 
who reportedly saw American POWs in Vietnamese prison camps recently, despite 
Hanoi's assertions that it holds no prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist monk, Iwanobu Yoshida, 65, has been hospitalized in northern Japan 
with what are termed mental and physical problems since he was freed in January 
after 14 years' imprisonment in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Japanese media reports and his daughter have said that 
Yoshida shared a cell with Americans in the re-education camp where he was 
held. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Embassy in Tokyo denied the claims, reiterating that Hanoi holds 
no prisoners from the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government has for years pressed Hanoi for an accounting of the 
1,730 Americans listed as missing in action in Vietnam and 634 missing 
elsewhere in the war zone. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Saturday that a military attache planned to fly 
to northern Sapporo today to interview Yoshida. 
</P>
<P>
The United States sought to interview Yoshida earlier but until now had been 
turned down by his daughter, Keiko Takatsuka, on grounds he was too ill, said 
the embassy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Takatsuka on Saturday said her father had shared a cell with three American 
prisoners for the last six years before returning to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"My father told me that when he asked them if they were Americans, they 
nodded," Takatsuka said from her home in Sapporo, on Hokkaido, Japan's 
northernmost island. The prisoners were not allowed to speak to each other, she 
said. Her father does not remember the names of the three men held in his cell, 
she added, but he said they were still "young and healthy." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the hospital where Yoshida is being treated said he suffers 
from mental disorders and a speech impediment and that only his daughter can 
understand him. Takatsuka said her father had a stroke three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida had been a city councilman in Mibari on Hokkaido before he became a 
monk in 1966 and emigrated to Vietnam. He set up a temple in Saigon, now Ho Chi 
Minh City, and became a South Vietnamese citizen in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in 1975, after the takeover of South Vietnam by Communist 
forces. On Jan. 20, Vietnam released him on humanitarian grounds.

TAIWAN'S BID TO RESTORE PHONE, MAIL LINKS TO CHINA FALLS SHORT

<P>
A bid to deliver mail and open direct telephone links from Taiwan to China for 
the first time in 40 years failed Saturday after planes refused to carry mail 
bags and phone lines failed to connect. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures provided by the International Telecommunications 
Administration showed that only several dozen calls could be made from Taiwan, 
disappointing thousands who wanted to contact their families in China. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of letters addressed directly to China could not be delivered because 
several airlines refused to take them, the Directorate General of Posts said 
without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
The Nationalist government on Taiwan banned all direct communications with 
China in 1949, when it was driven to the island by the Communists. But last 
week, it said it would allow some direct links to be restored.

BONN'S GENSCHER VIEWS GORBACHEV REFORMS AS 'HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The central question troubling diplomats in West Europe today is how to respond 
to the sweeping changes taking place east of the tattered Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
The political leader with more answers than most is West Germany's foreign 
minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a benign-looking and outgoing but 
controversial statesman who has been damned more often than praised in the 
United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher, 62, has been foreign minister for 15 years, longer than all the other 
West European foreign ministers put together. 
</P>
<P>
He is a man in perpetual motion, rarely ever at his desk in Bonn. As a popular 
story has it, "two Lufthansa jets crossed over the Atlantic, and Genscher was 
on both." On a recent weekend, he and his wife, Barbara, were in Halle, his 
hometown in East Germany, for a festival of Handel music. He has made a point 
of maintaining strong ties with his birthplace, which he left in 1952 to pursue 
a political career in West Germany, and this is regarded as significant by 
admirers and critics alike. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, Genscher believes that Western Europe must take advantage of the 
openings offered by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in order to reduce 
East-West tensions. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris recently, addressing a human rights conference, he declared: "An 
undivided Europe without the Iron Curtain, without the Berlin Wall and barbed 
wire, again appears attainable, and it will come." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Genscher formulated the now-classic response to the overtures 
from Moscow. "Let's take Gorbachev at his word," he said, adding more recently, 
"And let's keep him to his word." 
</P>
<P>
He argues forcefully that "the main question for the West is whether it regards 
the democratization and reform in socialist countries as a danger or as an 
opportunity it is willing to make use of." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historic Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
The answer, he says, can only be: "This is a historic opportunity. We must not 
let it slip by, not idly look on from afar, but must seek to exercise creative 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
Genscher's attitude has led to his being portrayed as a Pied Piper leading the 
Western Alliance off to a rash and possibly fatal rendezvous with the 
irresistible Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Some conservatives in the United States and Britain see him as a naive figure 
who is willing, in order to bolster his Free Democratic Party, to jeopardize 
the defensive coherence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Others 
suggest that Genscher plans eventually to turn West Germany into a neutral 
state as a step toward unifying the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
"Nonsense," one of his aides said recently. "Genscher wants negotiations with 
the Soviet Union in order to have a treaty that commits the Soviets to arms 
control, whatever happens to Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
Genscher put it this way: "The Cold War is over. The Iron Curtain is becoming 
brittle, is disintegrating. This is a historic hour in which we are developing 
our policy. Improved relations between East and West through economic 
cooperation, through technological cooperation, through cultural exchange and 
cooperation on environmental matters, must make the path to a better Europe 
irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, whose Free Democrats are junior partners in Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's ruling Christian Democratic-Christian Social coalition, is not 
alone among European leaders in advocating this course, nor are all his 
supporters liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Volker Ruehe, one of the more energetic and thoughtful members of the ruling 
Cristian Democratic Union and a parliamentary specialist in foreign affairs, 
told an interviewer recently: 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agrees that there is a need for a change in Western policies. The 
West must begin to see its security in a broader way -- that it is not 
dependent only on tanks and nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"There are democratic traditions in Central and Eastern Europe. The people 
realize the Communist system doesn't deliver. Communism is dead. So our 
policies should include economic and technical cooperation, geared to speed up 
change, to enable the Eastern nations to survive." 
</P>
<P>
The dangers the West faces involve unpredictable events in the Soviet satellite 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Christoph Bertram, diplomatic correspondent of the weekly Die Zeit and former 
director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said 
in an interview: 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Europe is going to be a mess, a dangerous mess. The real European 
security problem is not a Soviet attack on Western Europe but things going 
wrong in Eastern Europe. I think we are seeing the demilitarizing of East-West 
affairs. That doesn't mean military issues are going to be irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to influence events in Eastern Europe and stabilize the situation, 
I don't think NATO is the best institution. But I do believe the 12-member 
European Community could play a powerful role. I think we should offer them 
access to our big markets, always under certain conditions, bring them into our 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Several commentators have suggested that the West should offer a course for 
Eastern managers on how to operate free-market economies. In fact, West Germany 
already has such a program. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe that new financial credits should be offered, so long as they go 
into productive endeavors that benefit consumers and create stability. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Eastern European countries are resigned to the hopelessness of any real 
improvement -- and that is dangerous for stability," Bertram said. "So we in 
the West should provide them with a perspective for a future, a future worth 
making sacrifices for." 
</P>
<P>
Bertram and others suggest that the East Bloc be offered a sort of Marshall 
Plan, recalling the U.S. aid program that helped Western Europe rebuild after 
World War II. Under the Marshall Plan, Bertram said, "the Americans did not 
say, 'We know what to do for you'; they said, 'We invite you to tell us what 
you need.' 
</P>
<P>
"The same could be done for the East," he went on, "with the proviso that their 
requests be properly studied and be genuinely productive to better their 
economies and their peoples' lot." 
</P>
<P>
As for Genscher's approach, Bertram said: "He is visible, flamboyant, and while 
I agree with him on many matters of substance, I disagree with his approach. 
The latest NATO missile crisis was his doing, and his methods were highly 
immature. He has unnecessarily caused bad feelings in the alliance." 
</P>
<P>
Genscher has been pushing for early talks with Moscow on cutting short-range 
missiles in Europe, a move opposed by Washington, which, along with Britain, 
feels such talks would be premature as long as Moscow continues to maintain an 
overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone believes in cooperating with the Soviet Union in East Europe. 
Pierre Gallois, a retired French general and nuclear strategist, thinks that 
West German moral and economic aid to Moscow will only strengthen Moscow's hold 
over Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in his office at the International Institute of Geopolitics, a 
conservative research organization in Paris, Gallois said: 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union will keep its political control over this center of Europe, 
but it will enrich itself with an Eastern Europe reinforced by the technology 
of West Germany. I think this is really the strategy Gorbachev has in mind when 
he pushes Hungary, like Czechoslovakia, to Western economics." 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Bonnart, editor of NATO's Sixteen Nations, an independent military 
journal, keeps an eye on the East from NATO headquarters in Brussels. Bonnart, 
a native of Vienna, said: 
</P>
<P>
"We should maintain adequate defenses and, at the same time, always be open 
toward the Soviet Union. I completely believe in Gorbachev's sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
Genscher -- wily, charming, smart and effective but not altogether trusted -- 
summed up his position as follows: 
</P>
<P>
"The West won the Cold War thanks to its firmness, unity, readiness for 
dialogue and cooperation. It will need the same virtues now, at a time of great 
opportunity, to win the future -- not against the East, but with the East."

NEW SOVIET CONGRESS HAILED FOR BRINGING POLITICS TO THE PEOPLE

Often tumultuous, sometimes dramatic and occasionally boring, the initial 
session of the Soviet Union's new national assembly, the Congress of People's 
Deputies, launched the country on what its leaders promise will be the road to 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, popularly elected representatives had an open national 
forum to debate the country's problems and to propose solutions with the 
expectation that in future sessions they will be able to approve specific 
action, and the 2,250 deputies took full advantage of the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev described the creation of the congress and its 
first session as "the most outstanding event in the entire history of the 
Soviet state," a major achievement for perestroika, his program of political, 
economic and social reforms, and as a step forward toward "people's power." 
</P>
<P>
The session was "a unique opportunity," Gorbachev said, "to get a clear notion 
of the real state of things, achievements and shortcomings in our life, because 
of various negative phenomena," and then to discuss the reforms necessary for 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"Listening to the acute, at times sharp and emotional speeches of the deputies, 
one became aware again and again of the burden of problems, a huge burden, and 
of the fact that the main and most important work is yet ahead," the Soviet 
leader said. 
</P>
<P>
Radical changes consequently will be needed in the country's political 
structure and in the character of its economic system, Gorbachev said, 
describing the debates as a watershed for the Soviet Union and part of "a 
powerful democratic stream that is gaining momentum." Even Gorbachev's critics 
-- both those who thought that he had yet to recognize "the sovereignty of the 
people" and those who believed that he had yielded far too much of the 
Communist Party's power -- agreed on the historic nature of the congress in 
opening political decision-making to the people. 
</P>
<P>
The major decisions on resolving the country's problems were left for the 
542-member Supreme Soviet, the new, full-time legislature elected from among 
the deputies, and the streamlined and rejuvenated government announced here on 
Saturday by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
What the congress had done through its debates was to begin the development of 
a parliamentary system, a process that most modern nations undertook decades if 
not centuries ago but that was halted here after the Bolshevik Revolution in 
1917 as the party developed a monopoly on power and concentrated it in the 
hands of its leadership. 
</P>
<P>
What was most important in resuming this historical process was the ability of 
deputies to speak openly and freely on behalf of their constituents, with the 
expectation that they would not only be heard but would be able to effect 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing the birth of a nation," Yuri Feofanov, a political 
commentator for the newspaper Izvestia, said as the congress' inaugural session 
drew to a close last week. "Or, to be more precise, the rebirth of a nation." 
</P>
<P>
Although the party's determination to remain the leading force in Soviet 
society was evident as Gorbachev guided the session as the chairman of the 
congress, it had taken a major step toward fulfilling its commitment, made a 
year ago at a special party conference, to share power, and in doing so, to 
transform the country's monolithic political structure. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Soviet history, democratically elected representatives of 
the people were able to raise issues publicly that, while crucial to the 
nation's fate, were "forbidden areas" before -- military affairs, foreign 
policy, the security services, the privileges of party officials, corruption in 
the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
They went even beyond these sensitive issues, common enough in most Western 
parliaments, to criticize the nature of the Soviet political system, to 
question the way in which the Soviet Union was formed and thus its legitimacy 
as a state, to argue for such fundamental changes that some deputies 
effectively were proposing an end to socialism as it had been defined here over 
seven decades. 
</P>
<P>
And with popular mandates won in the first contested elections since the 
earliest days of the Soviet state, they insisted on broad and urgent changes 
with a vigor that stunned even themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Those who believed that the congress would be five or six days of heartfelt but 
predictable speeches by selected deputies were shocked as one deputy after 
another, many coming from quite remote areas, strode to the rostrum to indict 
the country's leadership for past mistakes, to plunge into yet another 
"forbidden area," to challenge other speakers or simply to raise an issue, 
however mundane, that the deputy's voters considered their most pressing 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Different Shock 
</P>
<P>
A different sort of shock was felt by the party's strong conservative wing, 
which was offended by the sharp assertiveness of liberal deputies, by the 
criticism of much of what they had held so firmly for so long and by the cut 
and thrust of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative programs were outlined by liberal deputies, answers were demanded 
to questions that no one dared ask here a year ago, Gorbachev's nominees for 
key posts found themselves sharply scrutinized rather than applauded into new 
jobs. And Gorbachev himself was confronted repeatedly with the challenge that 
he was concentrating too much power in his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
After years of political passivity in which the party leadership's decisions 
were accepted without question, political divisions quickly emerged among the 
deputies -- and could form the basis for competition between rival candidates 
in future elections as well as the development of voting blocs in the congress 
and the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
On the left, there is now an alliance among the liberal "Moscow Group," the 
nationalist delegations from the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania, the southern republics of Armenia and Georgia and radicals from 
across the country, with a conservative wing coalescing on the right around the 
party apparatus, the military and deputies from Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
But in the center there is a broad, moderate middle quite willing to follow 
Gorbachev's lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The merit of our congress was that on the basis of a broad debate, we got a 
fuller notion of the real processes taking place in the life of the country and 
in the attitudes of the people," Gorbachev said, summing up the session. 
</P>
<P>
That is what parliaments do, but it is something from which the old Soviet 
legislature was virtually barred as it gathered twice a year, two days each 
time, to enact into law without debate the decisions of the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Will we ever become a great parliament like the British Westminster or the 
American Congress?" one deputy asked during the final hours of debate last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"That is hard to say. It depends on us, how we shape this new institution, this 
Congress of People's Deputies. But we can say already that we are something 
entirely new in the history of the Soviet Union."

SOVIET PASSENGER TRAIN HITS BUS; 31 KILLED, 14 INJURED

A bus that was waved through a railroad crossing was struck by a passenger 
train, killing 31 people and injuring 14, the official Soviet news agency Tass 
said Saturday. It was the second major railway accident in a week. 
</P>
<P>
The bus, carrying 46 people, was rammed Friday afternoon while it was crossing 
the tracks between the settlements of Kamenskaya and Pogorelovo, about 716 
miles south of Moscow, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said 29 people died at the scene and two others succumbed while 
being taken to a hospital. Fourteen others were hospitalized, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"The train was traveling fast and the train driver was unable to stop it in 
time to avoid a collision with the bus," Tass said, quoting Vitaly Komarov, 
head of the State Traffic Inspectorate. 
</P>
<P>
A guard working at the intersection had waved the bus through as the train, 
traveling at 48 m.p.h., approached the crossing en route to Voronezh from the 
city of Adler on the Black Sea coast, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass also said that two trains had collided in the same area in August, 1987, 
killing 106 people. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's crash follows the explosion of a gas pipeline along the Trans-Siberian 
railway on June 3, which set off a fire that engulfed two trains and left 462 
people dead or missing.

Contractors working for the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
embezzled millions of dollars the government should have received from homes 
sold after foreclosure, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported in today's editions that private escrow agents took 
the money with little fear of recrimination from the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams has been ordered by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp 
to conduct investigations in Denver, Houston, New Orleans, Los Angeles and 
Washington, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several investigations and/or prosecutions around the country in 
which the loss to HUD or the funds allegedly appropriated to HUD exceed $1 
million each," said Gary P. Jordan, an assistant U.S. attorney in Baltimore who 
is handling a Maryland case. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, the newspaper reported, is separate from a congressional 
inquiry into allegations that influence-peddling at the department allowed more 
than a dozen former Reagan Administration officials to benefit from housing 
programs meant for the poor.

Smog in the San Joaquin Valley's citrus belt may be reducing yields of Valencia 
oranges by as much as 25%, according to a UC Riverside researcher. 
</P>
<P>
The ozone component of smog is most damaging to orange trees, which spend more 
energy fighting ozone and less energy producing fruit during photosynthesis, 
according to David Olszyk, UC Riverside physiologist. 
</P>
<P>
"What we found out is that trees are not able to set as many fruit, and you get 
fewer oranges per tree," Olszyk said. "To the degree you clean the air, you 
increase yield. We think the yields could go up as high as 25% if you really 
clean the air." 
</P>
<P>
Olszyk also said that smog also makes the fruit more yellow.

'FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT' ESCORT PLANE MAKES FORCED LANDING

A twin-engine airplane that was ferrying luggage and members of an entourage 
for boy aviator Tony Aliengena was forced to make an emergency landing after 
clouds of smoke spewed from the instrument panel. 
</P>
<P>
The plane -- following 11-year-old Aliengena in his bid to become the youngest 
pilot to fly around the world -- landed safely back at National Airport shortly 
after takeoff. There were no injuries, although a few passengers were treated 
for dizziness and minor smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena, who experienced mechanical trouble in his own plane Saturday, was 
unaware of the difficulties with the "chase" plane until he landed at Lawrence 
Airport outside Boston on the sixth leg of his seven-week "Friendship Flight." 
</P>
<P>
Smoke began spewing from the chase plane, one of two following Aliengena, when 
it was about 1,000 feet above the Potomac River. Pilot Lance Allyn maneuvered 
his King Air through restricted airspace above the capital's monuments and 
government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The exact problem had not been diagnosed late Saturday, although mechanics 
suspected a failed clutch gear. 
</P>
<P>
Repairs on both the chase plane and on Aliengena's plane in Lawrence are 
expected to be completed by Monday, enabling the boy and his entourage to 
continue on their way to Canada after a delay of no more than a day in the 
flight schedule.

SMOKE FELLS 14 SAILORS IN SHIP FIRE

Fourteen sailors suffered smoke inhalation when a Navy helicopter carrier 
caught fire in Long Beach Naval Station, but there was no serious damage to the 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
The Peleliu, an amphibious assault ship used as a helicopter carrier, caught 
fire on Friday night, Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire apparently broke out in the circuit breaker room, where a cable from 
shore powers the ship while in port. The cause of the fire was not known, but 
an investigation was under way. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was minimal and the 14 sailors who suffered smoke inhalation were 
treated and returned to duty Saturday morning, Chesser said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was put out by 10:30 p.m., less then twenty minutes after it was 
discovered, and repairs to the ship will be made by the crew. 
</P>
<P>
The Peleliu had recently returned from sea operations, but Chesser did not know 
the nature of the assignment. The ship normally has a crew of 900.

FOR HOLLYWOOD'S ELITE, A SPOT THAT'S STILL TOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI FINKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"See you Monday night at Morton's." 
</P>
<P>
It's as much a part of the Hollywood vernacular as "Let's do lunch," "My people 
will call your people" and "I'll get back to you on that tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The reason is sheer longevity: in a landscape littered with restaurants that 
come and go as fast as B-rated movies, Morton's is marking its 10th anniversary 
next month as the preferred West Coast watering hole for the heavy hitters of 
the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Some people can't even remember when it wasn't there. "I've been going to 
Morton's most of my adult natural life," allows Barry Diller, the chairman of 
Twentieth Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"At any given point in time, there's always one restaurant which is the 
high-priced commissary," says producer Steve Tisch ("Big Business," "Soul 
Man"). "In the past, it was the Brown Derby, Chasen's and Scandia. And for my 
generation, it clearly is Morton's." 
</P>
<P>
And, on this particular Monday night at Morton's, everyone's where they should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Near the window, producer Mark Johnson ("Rainman," "Good Morning, Vietnam") is 
talking animatedly with comedian Robin Williams and his bride, Marsha. Up front 
at separate tables, super-agents Ed Limato (ICM) and John Burnham (William 
Morris) are doing deals with darting eyes. Off to one side, manager Molly 
Madden is taking a meeting with actress/model Julianne Phillips, the Boss' ex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making an Entrance 
</P>
<P>
On their car phones, MCA chairman Lew Wasserman and Disney chairman Michael 
Eisner are announcing their imminent arrivals. And waiting to be seated are 
music producer John Kalodner, TV actress Judith Light, movie muscleman Dolph 
Lundgren and singer Pia Zadora, who waves to a friend already holding court 
across the waiter-filled aisles. 
</P>
<P>
Most restaurateurs would be in heaven to see these folks packed in potted palm 
to potted palm. But as the man behind Morton's looks around the pink-lit power 
palace he has erected at the corner of Melrose and Robertson in West Hollywood, 
he can't help but stifle a yawn. 
</P>
<P>
Because the secret's out. Frankly, my dah-ling, Peter Morton doesn't give a 
damn. 
</P>
<P>
"What drives me nuts is just the total preoccupation in this town with the 
entertainment business -- where you go to dinner parties and which movies are 
going to make money and who's going to a certain party -- and I think that's 
boring," says the 41-year-old Chicago native, whose great-grandfather, 
grandfather and father were all in the food business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another World 
</P>
<P>
"And while I do have to make a living here and I'm not the sort of person that 
is ungrateful to anybody, I think I've spent enough time outside this city to 
understand that there are more important things at the end of the day other 
than the film industry. And I thank God or whoever gave me enough smarts to 
realize that there is another world out there." 
</P>
<P>
A world that has made him very rich -- so rich, in fact, that he could buy and 
sell many of Morton's regulars, thanks to his $80-million-a-year international 
Hard Rock Cafe empire. Started in London in 1971, a cross between a burger 
joint and a rock 'n' roll museum, the Hard Rock Cafe has become one of the 
world's most successful privately held restaurant chains. 
</P>
<P>
And with his wealth has come certain perks. Not just the sumptuous homes in 
Coldwater Canyon, London and Honolulu he jets between, or the MOCA-quality 
contemporary art he collects, or the Ferrari Mondial convertible he tools 
around in. But, more importantly, the freedom not to have to cater to a 
Hollywood elite that is so used to be catering to. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, certain people expect me to patronize them," Morton says 
sardonically. "But fortunately I can operate Morton's in my unique way because 
I have this other company on the side. You could almost say the Hard Rocks have 
been my ticket out of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the qualities I admire most about Peter is that the motion picture 
business holds no glamour for him," says good friend Eric Eisner, president of 
the David Geffen Co. "And although he is very respectful of movie executives 
and appreciates their patronage, he respects their accomplishments no more or 
less than he would respect the accomplishments of someone on Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staying on Top 
</P>
<P>
But don't be fooled by his "what me worry?" demeanor. Because Morton already is 
ensuring that his restaurant stays on top of the heap for another 10 years. 
That's why next month he'll close Morton's briefly to give both the restaurant 
and the menu a facelift. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just time," Morton explains. "To be perfectly honest, I haven't been 
tending the store as diligently as I could. I have let Morton's slip a little 
bit. But I'm going to put some energy back into it and try to make up for a 
little lost ground." 
</P>
<P>
Slipping or not, Malcolm Forbes still lists Morton's as one of his three 
favorite places in the world to eat. And when Laurence Tisch took over the 
reins at CBS, he knew enough to head to Morton's during his first 
meet-and-greet trip to Los Angeles. That famous talent warehouse, Creative 
Artists Agency, deems Morton's one of only three "approved" restaurants for 
expense-account dinners, so a frequent sight is Michael Ovitz wining and dining 
client Kevin Costner at one end of the room while Ron Meyer toasts Madonna at 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cutting Deals 
</P>
<P>
For those keeping score, it was also at Morton's that Eisner, then with 
Paramount, persuaded a young actor named Eddie Murphy to sign a multipicture 
deal. And it was over dinner at Morton's again that Eisner decided to jump to 
the Walt Disney company. 
</P>
<P>
And, yet, to all except the most dedicated follower of the entertainment 
industry, the people who frequent Morton's are not the sort whom the paparazzi 
like to snap. If anything, they're more likely to wind up on the cover of 
Fortune or Forbes than Fame magazine. 
</P>
<P>
For example, while TV actress/producer Victoria Principal likes to take her 
husband to Spago on weekends, she always takes her management meetings at 
Morton's on weekdays. "So what I do is have my lawyer and my agent and my 
publicist meet me at Morton's because it's such a pleasant atmosphere to do a 
business dinner in," Principal explains. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with Hollywood's penchant for doing business over Morton's 
brochettes, regulars like to tell about the time a middle-aged man suffered a 
heart attack there. Even when he was carried away by paramedics on a gurney, so 
the story goes, none of the diners bothered to stop their wheeling-dealing long 
enough to look up and notice he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
That may explain why Jack Nicholson feels comfortable enough to eat dinner 
alone at the bar some evenings. Or why Pia Zadora has serenaded the restaurant 
accompanied by her daughter Kady playing her plastic guitar. Or why actor James 
Woods got down on one knee during dinner last January and asked his girlfriend, 
Sarah Owen, for her hand in marriage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Best Seats 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, like any L.A. restaurant, there are "good" tables -- and there is 
Siberia. According to conventional wisdom, the better the artwork, the worse 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some of Morton's original investors, like producers Jerry Weintraub 
and Allan Carr and singer Tina Sinatra, are guaranteed good seating. There even 
used to be an official "Jerry Weintraub" table marked by a small wall plaque, 
which had to be removed when the restaurant installed French doors three years 
ago. "But when Jerry comes in, he still likes to sit near there," notes Pam 
Morton, Peter's fraternal twin and the restaurant's manager. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, not everyone wants to sit at the "best" tables -- Nos. 4 and 6 in the 
front. For instance, Pam Morton once saved a much-sought-after table for two in 
the front for Barbara Walters even though someone else seated at the rear was 
ready to kill for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Barbara walks in, and it turns out she wants to sit in the back," Pam 
Morton laughs. A quick switch, and suddenly everyone was happy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Busiest Nights 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the beginning and continuing to this day, Morton's is hottest on 
Monday and Thursday nights. That's when the power is truly palpable, regulars 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"You never go on a weekend," noted Harris Katleman, president of Twentieth 
Century Fox television. "We call it 'civilian' night." 
</P>
<P>
"My theory, based on observation," says writer Ben Stein, "is that it's because 
people in the biz are so biz-oriented that they get restless over the weekends 
being home with their families, and by Monday they're dying to be out and 
talking deals. 
</P>
<P>
"And on Thursday, they're just stocking up on deals to make it through the 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
With its well-spaced tables (no eavesdropping allowed), muted acoustics (to 
make whispering easier) and simple but solid food (watch those cholesterol 
counts, remember!), it's clear why Morton's has withstood the test of time. 
"There's nothing trendy about it. And that's because Peter doesn't wear 
Japanese suits," Eric Eisner kids. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just direct and straight and easy," agent John Burnham notes, "which is 
very similar to Peter." 
</P>
<P>
It's 11 p.m. on this Monday night, and the last Rolls-Royce and Porsche parked 
under Morton's green neon sign have disappeared. Peter Morton, dressed preppily 
as usual in a tennis sweater and jeans, glances around his restaurant one last 
time before getting up to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," he relates, "Jonathan Tisch (the nephew of CBS chief Laurence 
Tisch), called up and asked if I'd put a Morton's in the CBS Building in New 
York. But I just really have been too busy to consider undertaking such a 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
He stares into space for a moment. And then a smile comes to his face. 
"Obviously, from a clientele standpoint, it wouldn't be duplicated. Because 
there's only one Hollywood."

JOHNNY APPLESEED'S WANDERINGS REMEMBERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
This is Johnny Appleseed country. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there really was a Johnny Appleseed. He planted thousands of apple trees 
across hundreds of miles of early America. He wasn't a fictional character like 
Paul Bunyan. 
</P>
<P>
Sower of apple seeds, planter of apple orchards on the American frontier from 
the late 1790s through 1845, Johnny Appleseed was in and out of Fort Wayne the 
last 10 years of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He died here at age 70 on March 18, 1845. His grave is in Johnny Appleseed 
Park. Nearby is the blocklong Johnny Appleseed Memorial Bridge spanning the St. 
Joseph River. 
</P>
<P>
Each summer, there's a Johnny Appleseed Festival at Johnny Appleseed Park, 
where huge quantities of elephant ears (a favorite Hoosier pastry) and apple 
cider are consumed and where people dress in old-fashioned costumes, many 
wearing mush pot hats. 
</P>
<P>
"John Chapman, better remembered as Appleseed John or Johnny Appleseed, was a 
fascinating character, a true eccentric, one of the best-known American folk 
heroes. People are often surprised to learn Johnny Appleseed actually lived. 
Over the years many myths have emerged about his life. The mush pot hat is one 
of them," said Steven Fortriede, a Johnny Appleseed authority. 
</P>
<P>
Fortriede, 43, associate director of the Fort Wayne Public Library, is a 
lifelong resident of this city. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up on the Johnny Appleseed story, as does everyone else here," he said. 
"Fact and fiction blend when it comes to the apple man. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wore Weird Garb 
</P>
<P>
"True, he always wore weird garb, but nowhere in the bits and pieces of 
information we collected about his life is there any mention of a mush pot hat, 
contrary to what Walt Disney and others would have us believe. 
</P>
<P>
"He did, however, wear a funny-looking pasteboard hat with a huge brim to keep 
the sun from his eyes. He wore a coarse coffee sack for a shirt. He went 
barefoot sometimes and other times wore rags to protect his feet. He didn't 
wear shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Fortriede wrote a 51-page pamphlet, "Johnny Appleseed: The Man Behind the 
Myth," published by the Fort Wayne Library, which also published six other 
pamphlets about the frontier nurseryman. 
</P>
<P>
The library has the best collection of Johnny Appleseed material in existence. 
The most definitive Chapman biography, Fortriede said, is Robert Price's 
"Johnny Appleseed -- Man and Myth," published in 1954 by Indiana University 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
"Tales of Johnny Appleseed's extraordinary kindness to insects and animals 
portrayed in the Disney movie, in children's book, in novels and plays, such as 
putting out campfires to protect mosquitoes, remorse over killing a rattlesnake 
that bit him, are hogwash. Johnny was a gentle, forbearing sort, but he was no 
fool," Fortriede said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman was born Sept. 26, 1774, at Leominster, Mass. A granite marker at the 
site of his birthplace reads: "He planted seeds that others might enjoy fruit." 
</P>
<P>
His mother died when he was 2 years old. His father, Nathaniel Chapman, one of 
the original Minutemen, fought at Bunker Hill. Virtually nothing is known about 
Johnny until 1797, when he was 23 and showed up in northwestern Pennsylvania 
sowing apple seeds. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known where he was educated or what motivated him to be an itinerant 
orchardist. "If I could find school records or other recorded information for 
that period of his life, I would write another pamphlet, perhaps a book," 
Fortriede said. 
</P>
<P>
From 1797 to his death, Chapman's name appears on trading-post records, voting 
registration lists and in county recorders' archives when he homesteaded or 
purchased land. There is a small amount of correspondence; his original estate 
papers are part of the Fort Wayne archives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeds From Cider Presses 
</P>
<P>
He traveled by foot, horseback and canoe (hollow logs), always loaded with 
apple seeds in leather pouches. He gathered his seeds from cider presses. He 
planted orchards, sold and gave away seeds and seedlings. What money he earned, 
he plowed back into land and into religious books by Emanuel Swedenborg, a 
Swedish scientist, mystic and spiritual leader. He distributed the religious 
books he bought. 
</P>
<P>
"The American frontier in his time was western Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. 
He was one jump ahead of the first settlers, clearing land, planting apple 
trees. He never married. He had an obsession to sow his seeds, plant his trees 
and to spread Swedenborg's teachings," Fortriede explained. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman probably saw more of America than any other man of his day, traveling 
hundreds of miles, leaving in his wake acres and acres of apple trees. No one 
who met him ever forgot him because of his dress, his demeanor. He was a small, 
wiry man with penetrating eyes, his contemporaries reported. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Appleseed touched the lives of pioneer families in much of western 
Pennsylvania, eastern Indiana and across the heart of Ohio. A monument in 
Ashland, Ohio, recalls that he ran 30 miles in 1812 to tell of an Indian 
massacre and to warn settlers that the Indians were heading their way. 
</P>
<P>
"An awful lot of people in this part of mid-America claim Johnny Appleseed 
planted trees in their back yards," said Fortriede, who told of monuments and 
plaques in many little towns and crossroads in Ohio, in memory of the patron 
saint of the apple tree. 
</P>
<P>
In Mansfield, Ohio, there is a Johnny Appleseed memorial put up by the local 
horticultural society in 1890, a Johnny Appleseed seat of honor in the public 
library and the Johnny Appleseed Middle School. The Johnny Appleseed Highway 
travels the apple man's pathway through the state. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time he sowed his apple seeds, Chapman also was the best-known 
missionary of the small Swedenborgian congregation that started in London in 
1788, about 16 years after the death of Emanuel Swedenborg. 
</P>
<P>
The first Swedenborgian sermon in America was delivered in Baltimore in 1792. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Swedenborgian in the world knows all about Johnny Appleseed," said the 
Rev. Harvey Tafel, 48, senior minister of the best known of the 35 
Swedenborgian churches in North America today -- Wayfarers' Chapel, or the 
Glass Church, as it is often called. It is perched on a picturesque Palos 
Verdes Peninsula bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The enchanting 
redwood-and-glass chapel embraced by trees and lush gardens is a popular 
wedding site for Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, the Swedenborg church remains a small congregation, with only 
2,600 members in North America, a few thousand in Europe and a few thousand 
scattered throughout many other countries in the world. The heaviest 
concentration of Swedenborgians is in South Africa, where it is an all-black 
church boasting 30,000 to 40,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
Among films in all Swedenborg church libraries is one titled "Johnny Appleseed, 
the Frontier Within," produced by the Swedenborg Foundation and starring Joseph 
C. Davies as Johnny Appleseed and Lillian Gish as the movie's narrator. It is 
the church's portrait of its most famous missionary. 
</P>
<P>
John (Johnny Appleseed) Chapman's grave in the Ft. Wayne park that bears his 
name is marked by a granite boulder inscribed with the words: "He Lived for 
Others."

MEAT IN THE TIGER'S MOUTH; 
</P>
<P>
BUFFALO AFTERNOON BY SUSAN FROMBERG SCHAEFFER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 535 
PP.; 0-394-57178-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elizabeth Becker, Becker covered the war in Cambodia for the Washington 
Post, is the author of When the War Was Over, a history of the Cambodian 
revolution, and has made several trips to postwar Vietnam. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Buffalo Afternoon" is an epic-sized novel of the Vietnam War built around the 
life of Pete Bravado, a confused teen-ager who enlists to fight that war and 
returns to America an angry veteran. Back home, Bravado is tortured by guilt 
and memories and by his fellow citizens who taunt him for fighting a war they 
find incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Fromberg Schaeffer interposes Bravado's story with that of a Vietnamese 
woman whom he meets during the war; the book opens with her life in a timeless 
Vietnamese village where, as a young girl, she passes innocent "buffalo 
afternoons" with her beast. American GIs mindlessly gun down this buffalo in 
the battlefield equivalent of a joyride and set the mood for this young girl's 
fall into prostitution and Schaeffer's interpretation of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
In film and fiction, the teen-age GI's bewildering odyssey through Vietnam's 
battlefields has become the vehicle of choice for expressing anger at the war. 
Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" is a recent cinematic example. A subject 
nearly as popular is that GI when he returns and becomes the troubled veteran 
lost in his own culture, stupefied by his compatriots' disregard for all he 
suffered in the line of duty. Bobbie Ann Mason's "In Country" is peopled with 
such veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer has joined these two genres in "Buffalo Afternoon," a novel of 535 
pages that, unfortunately, demonstrates why neither the young soldier nor angry 
veteran can explain the war or heal its wounds. She tells Bravado's story as if 
documents such as "The Pentagon Papers" did not exist; as if Gen. William C. 
Westmoreland had not written "A Soldier Reports" to give his side of the story; 
as if there were no way to get at the answers behind the war. 
</P>
<P>
"Buffalo Afternoon," instead, uses the Vietnam War as a backdrop for madness. 
Schaeffer is extremely gifted at portraying madness. Her battle scenes, 
Bravado's drift into madness when he tries to forget the war rings true. 
</P>
<P>
But Schaeffer becomes trapped by her own talents. To keep up the theme of 
madness, she ignores the full history. She rarely shifts her vision above or 
beyond the eyes of Bravado -- from his mean-spirited, lower middle-class 
community in Brooklyn to his soldier/tourist view of Vietnam. Her Vietnamese 
characters are stereotypes that deny any serious intent behind that country's 
war. All we meet are Vietnamese soldiers on both sides who commit atrocities 
with ease; innocent villagers who fail at their main occupation of keeping out 
of war's way, and the requisite black marketeers and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Li, the prostitute whose story opens the book, is the one Vietnamese allowed a 
full voice. She represents the ideal vision of village life destroyed by war; 
neither she nor any other Vietnamese is allowed to explain the basis of their 
war, the conflict between nationalism, Communist revolution and foreign 
intervention. Instead, she is the Vietnamese counterpart of Bravado, another 
victim of mindless slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The murder of her buffalo convinces Li she is without a soul and, so cursed, 
she becomes a prostitute. Bravado meets her in a whorehouse; she becomes 
attached to him thinking he, too, has lost his soul. Pregnant, she joins up 
with Bravado's unit where she becomes an unofficial guide and gives birth in 
the field to a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
This newborn infant is passed around by the admiring GIs until a South 
Vietnamese soldier puts her in his arms. He takes the child away and "dashed it 
head first against the ground. The fragile skull split open like a melon. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Bravado breaks the neck of this soldier with his bare hands. Li disappears. The 
central crimes of the novel are committed. 
</P>
<P>
Bravado leaves Vietnam soon after. "The whole damn thing doesn't mean 
anything," he has decided. "It doesn't add up to one life lost here." 
</P>
<P>
His alter-ego, another Italian-American named Sal, agrees. "It means Li was 
right. Remember? She used to say, 'Don't bring meat to the tiger's mouth'? 
We're the meat. They brought us to the tiger." 
</P>
<P>
The political analysis does not rise above this sentiment. Who are 'they'? Who 
is the 'tiger'? Is this a novel against all wars, or simply against Vietnam? 
</P>
<P>
Back home, demonstrators scream at veterans that the United States should never 
have become involved in another nation's civil war. A well-meaning, upper 
middle-class night school teacher humiliates Bravado by lecturing him and his 
classmates about the war and how the United States sent "good men over there 
and they end up mass murderers. . . . Never again will we be able to think of 
ourselves as the best country on earth. . . . Now we're all war criminals. By 
proxy." 
</P>
<P>
Is the teacher right or wrong or representing a composite of half-baked 
judgments? 
</P>
<P>
Bravado gets it from all sides. A right-wing cop tries to shoot him and a buddy 
in a bar fight over Vietnam. His wife resents his Vietnam-related maladies and 
leaves him after he tries to strangle her. He admits himself into a Veterans 
Administration hospital where his psychiatric treatment consists of heavy 
sedation. He burns his ex-wife's car. He hides, naked, in the bushes next to 
his old parish church when it rains. He has trouble holding down jobs. He 
nearly dies of complications from what seems to be Agent Orange but his doctor 
is afraid to admit this. 
</P>
<P>
Bravado's epiphany begins when his parish priest hears his confession and then 
makes sure he knows about a homecoming parade for Vietnam veterans. At another 
parade, in Chicago, Bravado is reunited with Sal who convinces him to start 
therapy with an Asian-American doctor who is herself the child of survivors. He 
finally meets a woman he can love, another veteran, and at the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial in Washington he finds "more strength to remember." 
</P>
<P>
On the last page, he and Sal decide: "It's buffalo afternoon for us, man. We're 
going to make it. It's the peaceful time. It's time to wander the fields and 
bring it all back home." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam as madness has become a dangerous cliche. Vietnam was a particular war, 
fought for particular reasons that explain what Schaeffer fails to explain in 
her book -- why those homecoming parades were "fifteen years too late," why the 
veterans had to organize their own war memorial, why the doctor won't diagnose 
Agent Orange complications. 
</P>
<P>
Unless novelists and film producers attempt to provide such answers, they 
irresponsibly play on our natural sympathy for the victim without telling us 
who or what caused the war. Even fiction requires cause and effect, otherwise 
there is no larger truth to be gleaned. And Americans will continue to dodge 
the question: Why Vietnam?

WINE: WHERE THERE'S A HILL; 
</P>
<P>
FLORA SPRINGS BECOMES A PRESTIGE WINERY IN THE SPAN OF ONLY A DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LAWRENCE BALZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WORD OF mouth is powerful advertising. It has quietly brought a loyal following 
to the family-operated Flora Springs winery, which has produced 10 vintages of 
delicious wines. Neighboring Napa Valley wineries have histories of landmark 
significance, but Flora Springs dates back only to 1977. That was when Jerry 
and Flora Komes came upon the neglected hillside property once owned by the 
late Louis M. Martini. The Komeses bought the property and enlisted the 
assistance of their son John, a contractor, to remold the old stone winery. And 
the Komeses' daughter, Julie Garvey, and her husband Pat, with careers in 
education, were lured into handling marketing and vineyard management. 
</P>
<P>
Some friends helped the family with the first harvest, thinking that it would 
be a lark, but "we never saw them again," Julie says. The family finished the 
picking, crushing, fermenting and bottling and produced 250 cases. The good 
wine inspired them to proceed with full-time devotion. 
</P>
<P>
When Flora Springs' 1979 Chardonnay captured a gold medal at the Los Angeles 
County Fair in 1981, the road to success seemed clear. Today, with four other 
vineyards, Flora Springs, with John as president and Julie as sales manager, is 
producing 17,000 cases a year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Ken Deis was hired as wine maker. And Pat Garvey, who had made the '79 
Chardonnay, turned his attention to grape growing. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Garvey saw potential for Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc 
grapes in unplanted sites higher on the hillside of the vineyards of the Komes 
ranch home. But he quickly learned that natural springs in a hillside vineyard 
are not necessarily a blessing. Vine roots don't like wet feet, drainage being 
essential to healthy vinifera. So, drainage tiles were installed. 
</P>
<P>
As Deis became more familiar with the taste potentials of these new plantings 
(the characteristics of the soil are different at the top of the hill than at 
the bottom), the wines emerged with more engaging complexity, more berry 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Current releases include: 
</P>
<P>
Flora Springs 1985 Trilogy ($30). With equal parts of the grapes from new 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc vines, this claret has the 
richness of varying supple tastes, suggesting cassis and ripe berry flavors. 
Cellar aging will round out its fine grape origins to full velvet-textured 
smoothness. 
</P>
<P>
Flora Springs 1987 Sauvignon Blanc ($8.50). Night-harvesting and cool 
fermentation give this wine the crisp freshness of the grape, a melonlike taste 
and a floral bouquet with a hint of grass. It's 100% Sauvignon Blanc, 
impressively long on the palate. 
</P>
<P>
Flora Springs 1987 Barrel-Fermented Chardonnay ($21) is fermented in new French 
Limousin, Nevers and Troncais oak barrels, with Montrachet yeast, bringing 
silky richness. Time on the yeast lees gives added dimension and complexity. 
The wine is elegant, almost grand. 
</P>
<P>
Flora Springs 1986 Merlot ($15) is well worth trying to find; it's in limited 
supply because most of the Flora Springs Merlot goes into Trilogy. This edition 
has a blending with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, giving the wine more substance and 
longevity.

NBA CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES; 
</P>
<P>
DOCTOR WILL MAKE PAINFUL DECISION FOR MAGIC, LAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometime this morning, in the privacy of the Lakers' training room at the 
Forum, Magic Johnson and Dr. Robert Kerlan will go one-on-one in perhaps one of 
the most important matchups of the National Basketball Assn. championship 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson says he will do everything possible to convince the Lakers' physician 
that his strained left hamstring has healed enough so he can help the team try 
to overcome an 0-2 deficit against the Detroit Pistons today in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
That might include holding back the truth about his condition. "I'm my own 
worst enemy," Johnson said Saturday after he sat out practice at Loyola 
Marymount. "You want to play so bad that you'll almost do anything. So, yeah, 
I'll lie. I mean, hey, this is it for me. I've worked too hard to get to this 
point. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a competitor, and because we are in the championship, I want to play. I 
saw the look on the guys' faces when 'B' (Byron Scott) went out (because of a 
torn left hamstring). I feel I have to be in there. Well, we're hoping for a 
miracle, basically. But the chances of me not playing are greater than the 
chances of me playing." 
</P>
<P>
The alternative if both Johnson and Scott cannot play is a starting Laker 
backcourt of Michael Cooper and Tony Campbell, with rookie David Rivers as the 
third guard. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said he has prepared for today's game under the 
assumption that neither Johnson nor Scott will play. 
</P>
<P>
And it is unlikely that Johnson can put one over on Kerlan during the 
examination. "The things we are looking for," trainer Gary Vitti said, "is the 
pain to the touch, pain on range of motion, pain on active-resistant range of 
motion -- where he is lying face down, tell him to bring the heel up and you 
try to prevent it, and you see how much pain he has -- and strength. 
</P>
<P>
"So no, he can't fool him." 
</P>
<P>
Even Johnson acknowledges that. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is, (Kerlan's) fingers do it. They rub down into that hamstring 
and that tells all." 
</P>
<P>
There is more involved than merely the extent of pain and degree of Johnson's 
incapacity. Johnson has the rest of his career to consider, and whether playing 
would help the Lakers or hurt them -- and himself. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the final decision belongs to Kerlan, although he will have 
considerable input. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a thing where we'll (talk about) if I hurt it (more) by playing, will I 
never play again," Johnson said. "It really depends. I never try to overrule 
anybody. If Doc says I can't play, then I'll stay out. 
</P>
<P>
"I can do all that (play with pain). It's just the fact, will this (he pointed 
to his hamstring) let me do it? The thing about it is, when you do cuts, you 
feel it. You feel everything all the time. You're using the hamstring all the 
time. It's not like the groin, where it bites you only when you make your last 
move . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no decoy. I'm not a guy who'll go in there for just a minute to charge the 
fans up. I'm going to go out to win, going to play. That's the only way I know 
how to play. . . . I'm going hard. If I hurt it by going hard, I'd rather do 
that than going out there and (being) a soft player and then getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
If he plays at all, Johnson said, it might be as a forward instead of as point 
guard. He would not have to run and cut as much or keep up with Detroit's 
guards, who have scored 137 of the Pistons' 217 points in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
Conceivably, the 6-foot 9-inch Johnson could move to forward, and James Worthy 
could switch to off guard. But Worthy has had problems guarding Joe Dumars, who 
is averaging 27.5 points a game and shooting 65.6%. So, Johnson might play 
power forward while A.C. Green moves to center, a lineup that Riley has used 
against smaller teams.

As is his custom, Riley did not speculate on matchups, especially the options 
if Johnson is cleared to play. But Riley stressed the importance of containing 
Piston guards Dumars, Isiah Thomas (22.5-point average) and Vinnie Johnson 
(18.5). 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' ploy of putting taller, less mobile defenders on the Piston guards 
has failed miserably, so Riley figures to go with the quicker, if less 
experienced and talented Rivers and Campbell, and perhaps Jeff Lamp. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a philosophy where we like to have overall height on the floor so we 
can be versatile," Riley said. "But in the first two games, that hurt us. 
They've got two quick guards who can do it all. We can't allow them to blow by 
us and do everything they've done. We've got to take that away." 
</P>
<P>
Before this series, Campbell, Rivers and Lamp played a combined 33 minutes in 
11 playoff games. Now the three figure to combine for many more than that in 
Game 3 alone. "Whether (Johnson and Scott) can play or cannot, that's not the 
issue," Campbell said. "It's up to us to get it done. We're professionals. 
We'll either do it or not. I believe we're going to do it. I believe we can." 
</P>
<P>
Without Johnson and Scott, stopping Detroit's guards is far from the Lakers' 
only concern. The Laker backcourt has averaged 40.2 points in the playoffs, so 
somebody has to score. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, the Lakers' leading playoff scorer, has shouldered most of the 
responsibility. Under relentless defensive pressure from Rick Mahorn, Dennis 
Rodman and John Salley, Worthy has averaged only 18 points and made 35.1% of 
his shots. In 11 previous playoff games, Worthy averaged 24.5 points and shot 
60.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"James has got to play basketball," Riley said. "He's not playing basketball. I 
don't say that in a critical sense. What he's doing is, he's taking such a 
burden on his shoulders and he's so concerned about their defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I just reminded him of Games 6 and 7 last year (when Worthy dominated). He was 
not any different player . . . but he just went out and played the total game 
and didn't worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what's got to be done," he said. "I got to play a little smarter. I've 
got to have confidence in Tony and Rivers, the guys out on the perimeter, and 
just let the game flow naturally. You know, not try to force the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Hamstrings remain the dominant issue of this series. Several Pistons say they 
believe Johnson will be in the lineup today, comparing the situation to Thomas 
playing in Game 7 of last season's NBA Finals despite a sprained ankle. "Oh, 
absolutely," said Piston center Bill Laimbeer, when asked if he expects Johnson 
to play. "We don't expect anything different from them. I think he'll play." 
</P>
<P>
Piston forward Mark Aguirre, a close friend of Johnson, added: "I don't think 
the pain will keep him from playing. The only thing (Laker doctors) can tell 
him is that it would jeopardize his career if he plays. Pain is not a big 
(question)." 
</P>
<P>
Even some of Johnson's teammates say that it might be impossible for Kerlan to 
convince Johnson to stay out of the lineup. "Magic will play for sure," Cooper 
said. "I've known Magic for 11 years. When the money's on the line, he's there. 
And the money's on the line." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the injuries and the fact that only two teams, the 1969 Boston Celtics 
and the 1977 Portland Trail Blazers, have recovered from 0-2 deficits to win 
the NBA title, Cooper added: "We'll win this still. It'll be one of the most 
dramatic wins in NBA history." NBA Finals Notes 
</P>
<P>
Piston injury report: Forward Dennis Rodman was kept out of practice Friday and 
Saturday because of back spasms. But he said he will play today. "I can't run 
at all today," Rodman said Saturday. "But I'll have it rubbed down before the 
game and I'll be ready. If I can walk, I'll play." . . . Center Bill Laimbeer 
said he will play despite a pinched nerve in his neck that has affected his 
outside shooting. Laimbeer has attempted only seven shots, making three, in two 
games. . . . Magic Johnson, comparing his strained left hamstring to when he 
tore the hamstring in February: "The pain is just as great, but the pull is not 
as bad as February." David Rivers, the Lakers' rookie point guard, has played 
only eight minutes in the playoffs, none in crucial situations. That figures to 
change, which pleases Rivers. "Coach just said, 'Be ready,' and I smiled, 
because I'm finally getting my chance to play," Rivers said. Pat Riley said he 
has confidence in Rivers based on his play against the Pistons on Feb. 14, when 
Johnson was out because of his torn hamstring. In that game, Rivers played 15 
minutes and held his own against the Pistons' Isiah Thomas. Said Johnson of 
Rivers: "His strength is his quickness. His weakness might be his 
(in)experience. He's never been in something like this before (the NBA Finals). 
. . . But I have confidence in his defense, because he did a good job in that 
second game (against Detroit)." . . . Thomas was a guest Friday night on "The 
Arsenio Hall Show." He presented the talk-show host with a Piston jacket and a 
"Bad Boys" T-shirt. . . . Thomas said he still has failed to reach Johnson, a 
close friend, to talk about Johnson's hamstring injury. "I've left messages all 
over town for him," Thomas said. "He must be in the trainer's room 24 hours a 
day." . . . The teams practiced at an auxiliary gymnasium at Loyola Marymount 
Saturday because an ice show was scheduled at the Forum and Loyola Marymount's 
main gym was occupied by a junior high cheerleading competition.

Stop me if you've heard this one before. But a horse that won two legs of the 
Triple Crown got beat in the Belmont Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
I think I've seen this film before. This was time No. 12 this has happened. 
This puts it in the majority. Eleven times, it has happened the other way: The 
two-time winner has made it a sweep in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
We were supposed to get Dempsey-Firpo. Instead, we got Tyson-Bruno. Easy Goer 
flattened Sunday Silence in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
They ran one of the great races ever run at the Preakness. This one looked more 
like the Rose Parade. Sunday Silence looked more like a guy chasing a bus than 
a horse in a race. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard of guys going home from a race track in a barrel? Of guys losing a 
bundle? 
</P>
<P>
How'd you like to drop $4 million? On one race? 
</P>
<P>
That's what Sunday Silence, Charlie Whittingham and Arthur Hancock III left 
lying around Belmont Park Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of guys have come to New York and gone home wiped out. Usually they buy 
the Brooklyn Bridge or a watch from a guy wearing a checkered suit. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's people didn't buy anything that turned green on their arms. 
But they could have walked away with $5 million. All Sunday Silence had to do 
was win the Belmont. The Triple Crown. He didn't even come close. The 
automobile company that puts up that prize must feel like a club that puts up a 
new car for anyone making a hole-in-one on a par-five. 
</P>
<P>
It still might be the biggest one-day drop in the history of racing. 
Bet-A-Million Gates never had a worse score. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse. The conditions of the bonus are these: Chrysler 
guarantees $5 million to any horse winning the Triple Crown. It puts up $1 
million to the horse scoring the most points in the three races (five points 
for a first, three for a second and one for a third). 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Alysheba won the first two races, then finished fourth in the 
Belmont. Another horse, Bet Twice, was second twice and then won the Belmont. 
He got the million-dollar bonus. Alysheba got the middle of the doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
As unfair as it sounds, it could have happened again to Sunday Silence. A horse 
that wins two out of three could shoot the wad by losing one. Sunday Silence 
had the presence of mind to finish second. He got the million with 13 points. 
The Belmont winner, Easy Goer, ended up with 11. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has not yet had to empty the vault to meet its pledge, but it's plain 
the bonus conditions are geared to a save-the-Belmont philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
It really wasn't much of a race. Seven of the horses had about as much business 
in there as burros. The fourth horse was 20 lengths behind the winner, 12 
lengths behind the third horse, and the last horse was 49 lengths behind 
everybody. They almost had to delay the next race. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who kicked his trainer in the head Friday, got a lick in at the 
bettors, too. He took about a million out of their pockets, going off as 
odds-on (4-5). 
</P>
<P>
Oh well, nobody's perfect. The story of the race was an immigrant from France. 
He did better than anyone from there since Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
Le Voyageur had not only never raced in this country before, he had never raced 
on dirt. He wasn't exactly Man o' War but he proved harder to get rid of than 
dandruff. Of course, he was the only horse in the race that had ever run a mile 
and a half before. In America, they pack a lunch for anything over 
seven-eighths of a mile. Le Voyageur must have thought it was a nice little 
sprint. He was just getting warmed up when he hit the finish. He led the race 
all the way to the far turn. It took the second fastest Belmont of all time 
just to shuffle him back to third. 
</P>
<P>
All the race really proved was one of the hoariest cliches in racing. This has 
been heard in every backstretch in America from camptown meetings to the lordly 
Jockey Club. It goes -- repeat after me -- like this: "Horses for courses." 
Stripped of the doggerel, it means that some horses don't like some race 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Great race horses can run on glass. But good race horses sometimes curl up 
their noses at inferior surfaces and pout. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't make him all bad, but Easy Goer just doesn't like Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
He came up to Churchill Downs last November hailed as the greatest thing on 
four legs since Pegasus. But when the Breeders' Cup came up mud, he chased an 
inferior sort called Is It True (who ran on the undercard at Belmont Saturday). 
He lost. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when he didn't lose again until the Kentucky Derby last May under the 
same conditions -- greasy track, intermittent rain -- the race track world 
concluded he was an indifferent sort. I mean, a great horse doesn't need his 
own deck. 
</P>
<P>
But what was overlooked was that Easy Goer hooked up with 15 horses on a track 
and conditions he hated in the Derby -- and finished second. In the Breeders' 
Cup, he took on 10 horses and a surface that irritated him -- and finished 
second. 
</P>
<P>
When inferior horses hate a track, they finish last. They give up. Sulk. Pout. 
Refuse the bit. Lug in. Lug out. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer had too much class for that. It was just his bad luck the most 
celebrated race in America took place in a part of the country he found 
difficulty standing up in. 
</P>
<P>
This is a horse that ran a 1:32 2/5 mile this spring. Only one horse in the 
history of thoroughbreds has run faster. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of people can't handle Kentucky in the rain. But the burden of the proof 
is, Easy Goer is the best in his business when the sun is shining and the track 
isn't glassy. And in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, he finished second in the Preakness. If you consider 6 inches off the 
winner as second. Only sophisticated optics could determine that it wasn't a 
dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
When Long Island came up with the kind of weather that capsizes destroyers all 
week, the handicappers all but wrote Easy Goer off. 
</P>
<P>
But this wasn't Kentucky. Easy Goer just stalked Sunday Silence like that 
railroad dick after Butch Cassidy. He just swept by him at the far turn as soon 
as he got ready. He ran the fastest Belmont this side of Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
If he stays out of Louisville in the rain, no one can beat him. Of course, 
that's a good game plan even if you don't have to run.

SOCKERS HANG ON, THEN LET IT ALL HANG OUT

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are the rare moments that turn grown men into children. 
</P>
<P>
Moments of extreme emotion. Moments of tears. Moments of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers were the laughers. Fresh off their seventh indoor championship, won 
Saturday night with 6-5 victory over the Baltimore Blast in Game 7 of the Major 
Indoor Soccer League championship series in Baltimore Arena, the maturity level 
of each player dropped drastically. This was fourth-grade stuff. And it was 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
These were kids at an amusement park, yelling, dancing and shouting on the 
arena carpet as many of the 11,220 spectators watched, wearing frowns and 
crossed arms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one time you can be a kid," defender Kevin Crow said. "Nobody can 
blame you for it." 
</P>
<P>
There were also the tears. Those of Baltimore Coach Kenny Cooper, so sure he 
had finally put together a team that could take the teeth out of the Sockers' 
dominance. And of Blast forward David Byrne, whose spirited play as the sixth 
attacker for 12:50 in the fourth quarter brought Baltimore back from a 6-1 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne couldn't pinpoint his feelings. "I can't really say. Just really upset 
and disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper could. "I was gutted. We put on a hell of a show. But we came up short. 
That's the toughest thing." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman, wearing the pungent scent of champagne on his dress 
shirt, was appropriately elated, but spoke of Cooper before praising his 
Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
"I just really feel bad for Coop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Newman felt good. His team had been blown out, 7-0, in Game 6. 
But there were no long faces, no worries. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew coming into this game we had a great chance," said Newman, who opted to 
use a defensive strategy rather than running with Baltimore, as the Sockers had 
tried so unsuccessfully Thursday. "We had no nerves at all tonight." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1:58 span of the third quarter the Sockers melted sour memories of 
Thursday with three goals, giving them a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
First, Branko Segota scored, assisted by Zoran Karic. Segota, who finished with 
two goals, an assist and the player of the game award, converted a penalty kick 
late in the second quarter to give the Sockers a 2-1 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Brian Quinn took a pass from defender George Fernandez, swerved around 
forward Carl Valentine and popped in his seventh goal of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And after that, Steve Zungul, veteran of seven championship series and winner 
of six, sent a ball ball blocked by Karic into the upper right corner of the 
Blast goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Blast was dead. The Sockers were champions. Right? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
A few jitters and tentative steps followed the Sockers through the fourth 
quarter. Waad Hirmez scored early in the period on an uncharacteristic blunder 
by Blast goalie Scott Manning, who let the shot bounce off his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Manning took a seat. Byrne put on a goalie shirt. Things got exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Kai Haaskivi scored once, forward Domenic Mobilio three times. 
Suddenly the fans were standing and the Sockers were wondering. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were really shell shocked and caught off guard," defender George 
Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne distributed the passes nicely and also got away with a hand ball few 
could believe the referees missed. Standing well beyond the redline, Byrne 
dived to misdirect a long shot by Fernandez. Twelve seconds later Baltimore 
scored. The Sockers complained. The refs didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
"(The shot) was going in," Fernandez said. "You've just got to hand it to him. 
It was a great play on his part." 
</P>
<P>
A play the Sockers wouldn't have forgiven if it had cost them the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if that had cost us the championship it would have been the biggest 
travesty in MISL history," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, lifted by the play of goalie Victor Nogueira, the championship 
series MVP, refused to release its clutch on this victory during the final 
4:28. When the clock reached all zeros, everybody collapsed. Then, the Sockers 
celebrated in virtual silence. 
</P>
<P>
Each Socker took a drink of champagne from the championship cup. For some, this 
was more than just a good feeling. It had shades of "Take that." The doubters 
had gotten their answer. 
</P>
<P>
"They said we couldn't do it," Fernandez said. "We proved them wrong. I'd just 
like to shove that in their faces. They can call us whatever they want, but 
when it comes right down to it, we're the best." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, now the owner of five championship rings, says each one is special, and 
unique. 
</P>
<P>
"You love it for the moment," he said. "You never know when it ends. This could 
be my last championship." 
</P>
<P>
So wraps a strange season, one that started with financial problems and ended 
with high fives, hugs and kisses. The ever unpredictable Sockers had again 
found a way. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of this team is to do things the hard way," Crow said. "This is an 
emotional team. That's why we have so many peaks and valleys." 
</P>
<P>
* NEW FACES, SAME RESULT 
</P>

BLANKED PADRES LOOK IN MIRROR, SEE LITTLE LIFE LEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padre clubhouse emptied quickly and quietly Saturday. Another game, another 
loss on a trip that is shaping up as the Padres' worst of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Most caught the first team bus back to the hotel. Only a few stragglers were 
left to ponder what has happened over the past 10 weeks to a team that emerged 
from Arizona with the best spring record in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Their commentary was as biting as the Padres' 1-0 loss to the San Francisco 
Giants in front of 29,116 on a day when the winds were doing their troublesome 
dance across Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was weird, ugly, the bench was just dead," third baseman Tim Flannery 
said. "It's so easy to say, 'The weather is ugly, it's miserable, the guy is 
pitching great, we'll get them tomorrow.' And I think that is what has 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
The result was the Padres' fifth defeat in a row, extending their longest 
losing streak and dropping their record on the trip to 1-8. A loss in today's 
finale against the Giants would allow the Padres to match their worst extended 
trip since they went 1-9 on a trip in April, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not playing with any emotion or enthusiasm, and we haven't been," first 
baseman Jack Clark said. "That is what bothers any manager or player who plays 
with that intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he sensed the problem since joining the team in an off-season deal 
with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"Because (the Padres) came in third place last year, we were going to win the 
World Series automatically," he said. "Now reality has set in. Now you look, 
and what you see is what you get. And it is not what everybody expected." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres started this trip June 2 in Cincinnati, a season-high four games 
over .500 and 1 1/2 games out of first place in the National League West. Now 
they are three games under .500 (30-33) for the first time since they were 
18-21 on May 14. They are in fourth place and have fallen more than a half 
dozen games behind not just one good team, but three. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the blame, Flannery said, rests with an attitude problem among some 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not naming names and I'm not pointing fingers," Flannery said, "but I have 
said all along we have six guys or so, maybe seven guys in the lineup, who are 
doing the team unity aspect of scoring runs. Then we get a clog stuck in the 
lineup. He is not an unselfish batter; it's just him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it is like a cancer that needs to be taken out. Because it can 
get infectious." 
</P>
<P>
Flannery cited as an example a recent game in which the Padres came from behind 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard someone cussing after the game," Flannery said. "I looked at somebody 
and said, 'I thought we won tonight.' (The player) wasn't happy because he 
didn't get any hits." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jack McKeon said he shares his players' disappointment. He has 
concluded that some players are having trouble performing on a team which, 
despite its recent slump, has been in the race since the start. Some of those 
same players did well last season after he took over on May 28 with the Padres 
in fifth place with a 16-30 record, 11 1/2 games behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to play on a loser," McKeon said. "It's tougher to play on a 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon isn't ready to identify all these players by name, but earlier in the 
week, he cited John Kruk and Randy Ready. Both had their best seasons when the 
Padres finished 1987 with the worst record in the National League. They were 
struggling until McKeon traded them last week to Philadelphia for Chris James. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon has hinted all week that others who he believes share that style could 
follow them out of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack is a good baseball man," Clark said. "He'll do whatever he has to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres wasted eight innings of combined two-hit pitching from Ed Whitson 
and Greg Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson (9-3) had a career-high, seven-game winning streak stopped as he 
allowed only two hits, two walks and one run in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
The only hits came on Terry Jones' grounder that bounced off Whitson's leg in 
the second for an infield single and Robby Thompson's third-inning triple. 
Thompson scored the game's only run when the next batter, Will Clark, flied to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's hit was a twisting fly ball that got that caught in the currents and 
blew away from right fielder Marvell Wynne and into the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"It was mother nature at her best," Whitson said. "A wind-blown triple down the 
line that no one could do anything about. Marvell gave it his best shot. It's 
just the way our ballclub is going right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres managed eight hits and struck out 10 times against three Giant 
pitchers. Starter Scott Garrelts (5-1) earned the victory with relief help from 
Rich Gossage in the seventh and Craig Lefferts, who pitched the final two 
innings to earn his 11th save. Garrelts left early because of tightness in his 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
The shutout was the eighth tossed against the Padres in 63 games, the first by 
1-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been waiting all year for somebody to start hitting," McKeon said. "But 
it's getting past the time of hope." 
</P>
<P>
Through spring training, when the Padres were doing so well, McKeon said to 
anyone who asked that spring training meant nothing. The Padres, apparently, 
have taken McKeon's view to heart.

"In spring training we were just tearing the cover off the ball just about 
every time we were out there," Whitson said. "Now it's just one of those things 
where we just need to relax. Just try to do whatever we can, not more than what 
we're capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson had been the one pitcher the generally anemic Padre batters had 
supported. But even that failed them this time. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson left for a pinch-hitter in the seventh. It was only the second time 
that the Padres had failed to score for Whitson. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said I'd rather be lucky than good, and today my luck ran out," 
Whitson said. 
</P>
<P>
In a streak of eight Whitson starts that began April 27 with an 8-1 victory in 
Pittsburgh, the Padres scored 50 runs. They scored seven or more runs in five 
of those games, the only times this season they have scored more than six runs 
for any pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, as has been their style on this trip, squandered their best scoring 
opportunity. Their best chance against Garrelts came in the first inning after 
Flannery singled and Tony Gwynn doubled to put runners at second and third. But 
both runners were stranded as Jack Clark struck out and Wynne grounded to 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn remained the only consistent offensive bright spot. He went two for four 
to extend his club season-high hitting streak to 12 games and raise his average 
to .355, his highest since he was at .382 on April 12. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn is batting .568 (21 for 37) on the trip. But the Padres need more than 
Gwynn's bat. Flannery said the team needs some kind of spark to bind them 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say we need a fight," he said. "I can't lean over and take 
the first pitch in the head and charge the mound. But I've thought about it." 
</P>
<P>
But what Flannery really wants is for the Padres to play with confidence and 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be afraid of winning," he said. "With winning, you have to go one 
step beyond just showing up." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris James, who ended a zero-for-38 streak with a single Monday in Houston and 
had three more hits the next night, is struggling again. He is hitless in his 
past 13 at-bats and grounded into a double play to end the game Saturday. He is 
four for 57 since May 23. . . . First baseman Rob Nelson is hitless is 13 
at-bats and does not have a hit since May 21.

BLUE JAYS FINALLY GET TO USE NEW NEST WITH A CONVERTIBLE TOP

<TEXT>
<P>
At the beginning -- which was 1977 or 1982 or 1984, depending on which Skydome 
historian you are speaking with -- there was this rather simple and relatively 
economical idea: Build a domed stadium, and do it for $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
Then, somebody got the bright idea that what this fair city's sports fans 
really needed was a stadium that would be equally comfortable in April chill 
and August swelter. So, the rush was on to design a stadium featuring North 
America's first retractable lid. 
</P>
<P>
But when you think about it, what's so great about a technologically unique 
stadium if you can't see the playing field from the window of your hotel room? 
Back to the drawing board to add a 350-room luxury hotel, which includes 70 
suites that have clear views of the action. 
</P>
<P>
Hold it right there. Even with a moving roof, a one-of-a-kind hotel, a $710,000 
cartoon sculpture of baseball fans looming over the stadium entrance, the 
largest video scoreboard in the world, TV monitors that beam pictures of 
bullpen activity to the dugouts and a pitching mound that can be raised and 
lowered in a matter of minutes, this still is not the complete sports and 
entertainment pleasure palace. 
</P>
<P>
Something was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, several somethings. 
</P>
<P>
So, a 125-seat movie theater was added. 
</P>
<P>
So was a 300-foot bar overlooking the field. 
</P>
<P>
And two McDonald's, a 700-seat restaurant and a Hard Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
And a trendy health club where initiation and annual membership fees will 
lighten well-to-do patrons to the tune of about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, now that's a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, after almost a decade of planning and construction, the Skydome, 
with its official price tag climbing toward $500 million, will open its doors, 
and perhaps, its roof. In the baseball opener, the Toronto Blue Jays and 
Milwaukee Brewers will play, and the city will breathe deeply and happily. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? 
</P>
<P>
The early indications all point to the stadium getting off on just the right 
concrete footing. As you'd expect, all 53,000 seats for the game long ago were 
gobbled up by baseball fans and curiosity seekers. But the rush to experience 
the Skydome apparently will not end there. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays' first seven games at the Skydome, including four against the 
woeful Detroit Tigers, are virtual sellouts, and club officials are predicting 
average crowds of more than 40,000 for the rest of the season. (That is an 
improvement of some 25 percent from the Jays' average attendance for the 26 
games they played this year at Exhibition Stadium). 
</P>
<P>
The financial success of the sometimes covered, sometimes not, stadium also 
depends heavily on it being booked for more than 200 dates each year, according 
to Skydome officials, and here, too, the stadium seemingly is meeting 
projections. In its first month of operation, for instance, the stadium has 
bookings for 18 dates. Included are 10 baseball games, a motorcycle race, 
workouts for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, who also 
will play their home games at the Skydome, and a Rod Stewart concert Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Skydome's downtown location also is expected to give a boost to Toronto's 
thriving business district. Within three blocks of the dome are the looming CN 
tower, Toronto's convention center, a 25-story luxury hotel, a symphony hall 
and numerous shops, restaurants and parking lots. All stand to gain 
considerably from the business generated by the Skydome, particularly the 
parking-lot owners. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 500 parking spaces are planned for the Skydome lot, and more than 
300 of those will go to sky-box renters. There are roughly 17,000 parking spots 
within walking distances of the park, however. The lot directly across the 
street from the stadium is promising game-day prices of $15 per car. 
</P>
<P>
All dollar figures are Canadian dollars, which are worth about 85 cents of an 
American dollar. 
</P>
<P>
It is safe to say the Skydome will mean a lot of money to a lot of people. But 
even the stadium's most ardent supporters say they are hard-pressed to predict 
exactly how much. 
</P>
<P>
"Megabucks," said Toronto Sun publisher Paul Godfrey, who as chairman of Metro 
Toronto -- sort of a super mayor -- led the charge to bring an expansion 
baseball team to the city in the 1970s and later championed the stadium 
project. "This facility will mean multimillions of dollars for the Toronto 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
"What you are looking at down there is a third-generation sports facility," 
said Ron Willoughby, who represents a consortium of 28 corporations who have 
contributed $140 million to the Skydome project. "It's a destination, and it 
will become one of the major tourist attractions of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the seeming frenzy, not everyone in the city is flipping his lid over 
the retractable dome. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto city councilman Howard Levine appears pained by the stadium, which he 
said is being built in the wrong location and at a time when the city should be 
concentrating on issues such as affordable housing and mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
"Toronto has the reputation of being a livable city, but increasingly it's 
becoming unlivable," Levine said. "We've got problems that come with being a 
maturing metropolitan area, and we can't come to terms with them by focusing 
all our energy on the Skydome." 
</P>
<P>
If Levine is concerned about Toronto's social agenda, he appears tormented by 
another likely effect of the Skydome: traffic. The decision to put the stadium 
in the downtown district may be stimulating businesses, but its location has 
every cab driver in the city contemplating traffic backups to Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
"From a planning standpoint, it is a horribly wrong location, in the center of 
an ever-increasingly congested city," said Levine, who represents 39,000 voters 
in a district north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Skydome's opponents cannot shout too loudly about the stadium's 
exorbitant price tag, which exceeds original estimates by about 300 percent. 
The city government and province of Ontario have contributed $30 million each. 
The rest of the funding, roughly $470 million, is coming from the participating 
corporations and bank financing. 
</P>
<P>
The 28 corporate "partners," including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Nabisco and 
Nestle, each has contributed $5 million to the project, for which it gets a sky 
box, parking spaces and the right of first refusal on stadium contracts that 
relate to its products. For instance, McDonald's got first crack at the food 
concession; stadium management could have considered other bids only if it had 
been unable to strike a deal with the fast-food giant. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fierce corporate competition, Nestle crunch bars and McDonald's 
first-ever hot dogs probably will not be the highlight of a visit to the 
Skydome. That distinction will be reserved for the first retractable lid ever 
constructed on a major, multipurpose stadium -- the tennis center that is host 
to the Australian Open generally is credited with being the first sports 
facility so built -- and one that should make the rain-, snow- and hailouts 
that have plagued the Blue Jays throughout their 12-year history a thing of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The roof is made of four pieces, which fold neatly atop the outfield wall of 
the stadium. Together, they span more than eight acres and weigh the equivalent 
of about 5,480 cars. The roof sections, three of which are movable, sit on 
bogies, or casters, that glide electronically on a railroad track along the rim 
of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The roof driver, who sits at a control board that features 32 orange, red and 
green monitoring lights, can move the pieces individually or in sequence. When 
the roof is closing, panel 1, an eggish structure moves from its position on 
the south end of the stadium, along the west side, and locks into position on 
the south end. 
</P>
<P>
Panels 2 and 3, which are roundish bands, then inch southward, linking the end 
pieces and completing the changeover from open to closed. The transformation, 
which has taken as long as 45 minutes while technicians master the subtleties 
of roof driving, eventually will be completed in as little as 20 minutes, 
stadium officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Willoughby, who has been with the project throughout the nearly three years of 
actual construction, is one of the few who has seen the roof move. He described 
it with the passion one might use to report on a man buttering toast. "It is 
not quite like watching grass grow, but it is very quiet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The moving roof solves the biggest problem facing baseball in Toronto: the 
elements. Although foul weather has postponed only 29 games in the 12-year 
history of the franchise, the Blue Jays routinely play in teeth-chattering 
conditions until deep into May. And on April 7, 1977, the team made its 
major-league, home-opening debut in a driving snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the sliding roof raises a whole new set of concerns. Among them: Who 
will decide whether a game will be played indoors or outdoors? When will that 
decision be made? And what if bad weather comes up suddenly; are Blue Jays fans 
in for roof-closing delays? 
</P>
<P>
According to Howard Starkman, the baseball team's director of public relations, 
Blue Jays officials will contact the local weather service several hours before 
a scheduled home game to ask for a forecast. If rain or snow is threatened, the 
officials then will decide whether the roof should be closed. And what of the 
other questions posed by the Skydome? Will McDonald's impose a limit of two 
tossed salads per fan? Is it permissible to sing "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" 
while lounging in the health-club Jacuzzi? 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, what if the roof gets stuck? 
</P>
<P>
Don't ask. At least, not today.

SEGOTA'S TWO GOALS LEAD SAN DIEGO TO TITLE, 6-5

Branko Segota scored a pair of goals, and the San Diego Sockers held off a 
last-quarter, four-goal rally to defeat the Baltimore Blast, 6-5, Saturday and 
win their fifth Major Indoor Soccer League championship. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth championship in six years in the MISL and the second in a row 
for San Diego, which beat Baltimore, four games to three. San Diego has beaten 
the Blast three times in championship series play -- in 1982, 1983 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But the Blast put a scare into the Sockers, scoring four times in 7:27 of the 
final quarter after replacing goalkeeper Scott Manning with sixth-attacker 
David Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
Domenic Mobilio led the Blast comeback, scoring three consecutive goals. Kai 
Haaskivi started the rally with his third goal of the playoffs 3:05 into the 
final period. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to cool down and settle down," said Socker midfielder Steve Zungul, 
who earned his sixth MISL championship ring. "Even when they started scoring, 
scoring, scoring, we didn't panic." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego goalkeeper Victor Noguiera, who had 21 saves in the final, was named 
the series' most valuable player. Socker midfielder Paul Dougherty was chosen 
the series' unsung hero. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't play against Zungul and Segota in a one-game series and expect to 
win," Blast Coach Kenny Cooper said. "It's hard to get any offense against a 
team that plays a zone defense." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, runner-up to the Blast in the regular season, broke open a 2-1 game 
by scoring three times in the opening 2:33 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Segota's second goal gave the Sockers a 3-1 lead 35 seconds into the third 
quarter, and Brian Quinn and Zungul scored goals 35 seconds apart for a 5-1 
advantage.

SUPER CHALLENGE OF MOTOCROSS; 
</P>
<P>
STANTON WINS, PUTS ICING ON CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
New Supercross champion Jeff Stanton closed the stadium motocross season 
Saturday night by winning the Coors Super Challenge of Motocross before 40,173 
fans at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
It took Stanton eight laps to catch George Holland, but once he got the lead, 
there was no stopping the Honda rider from Sherwood, Mich. Two Kawasaki riders, 
Jeff Ward of Mission Viejo and Ron Lechien of El Cajon, finished second and 
third, respectively, as Holland faded to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In prerace ceremonies, Stanton received a check for $50,000 for winning the 
Supercross championship and also received the traditional No. 1 plates from 
1988 champion Rick Johnson of El Cajon. Johnson, who won the first five stadium 
races this year, was injured during practice last March and has not ridden 
since. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Stanton's fourth of the 15-race season. 
</P>
<P>
Holland, Stanton's Honda teammate from Kerman, Calif., came off the starting 
line in front, much as he did in his heat, but in neither race could he hold 
on. Ward caught and beat him in the heat, and Stanton caught him after several 
laps over a Coliseum track that included two side-by-side runs up and through 
the peristyle arches. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought all along I could catch Holland because I ride with him in practice 
and I knew he wasn't in as good a shape as he needed to be to go 20 laps on 
such a long track," Stanton said. "The track was very fast, but very long for a 
Supercross and it was very tiring. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more concerned that Ward might be coming on, but after about 15 laps I 
felt pretty secure. I only wish Ricky Johnson could have been riding all along. 
We'd have put on quite a show, I think. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a lot of confidence when I beat him straight up before he got hurt and I 
think that helped me all season long." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton also leads the 250cc national outdoor series with two races remaining. 
He will then set his sights on the 500cc outdoor season, during which Johnson 
expects to be ready to defend his championship. Stanton, who has virtually 
clinched the 250cc title, would become the first rider to sweep all three 
American Motorcyclist Assn. divisions if he were to win the 500. "I think the 
500 is my best series because it favors a bigger rider and I'm bigger than 
most," the 6-foot 180-pound Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Cooper of Stillwater, Okla., who was in second place in Camel Supercross 
standings going into Saturday's race, did not ride after suffering a broken 
collarbone during practice late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kiedrowski of Canyon Country earned $10,000 for winning the 125cc Camel 
Shootout between the top riders of the East and West coasts after a 15-lap duel 
with Damon Bradshaw of Charlotte, N.C.

UNLIKELY HERO POWERS PIRATES, 6-5

<P>
Rey Quinones, who had hit only two home runs all season, wasn't even thinking 
about hitting one. Randy Myers, who hadn't given up a home run in 28 
appearances this season, certainly wasn't thinking about giving one up. 
</P>
<P>
But Quinones hit a two-run homer off Myers with one out in the bottom of the 
ninth inning Saturday, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates a 6-5 victory over the New 
York Mets at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Since blowing a 10-run lead in a 15-11 loss to Philadelphia on Thursday, the 
Pirates -- who are 5-21 when trailing after six innings -- have rallied for two 
consecutive come-from-behind victories over the Mets. They beat the Mets 4-3 in 
10 innings Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds singled to start the Pirate ninth and moved to second on Jeff 
King's sacrifice bunt. Quinones, who had doubled and scored in the eighth, then 
hit a 1-1 pitch into the left-field seats for his third homer and the first 
Myers has given up in 35 1/3 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't thinking home run, I was just trying to make contact against him," 
Quinones said. "I think I hit it pretty good. We're picking it up now, we're 
starting to play like we can, like the real Pirates." 
</P>
<P>
Myers (5-2) had given up only two runs in his previous 23 appearances and had 
an 0.31 ERA in his last 28 2/3 innings. He had pitched out of a bases-loaded, 
one-out jam in the bottom of the eighth with the Mets leading by a run. 
</P>
<P>
"He caught a fastball and he hit it out, and I knew as soon as it went off his 
bat it was a home run," Myers said. "The hitters know that I'm going to be 
throwing (fastballs), and it they make good contact, it's going to go a long 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Houston 1, Atlanta 0 -- Jim Clancy gave up five hits in 7 1/3 innings as the 
Astros beat the Braves at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros, who have won five straight, are unbeaten in their last 11 one-run 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy (4-4) struck out three and walked two. Dave Smith, the third Houston 
pitcher, got the last three outs for his 12th save in 13 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
John Smoltz (7-5) had retired 14 straight before Billy Hatcher singled with one 
out in the Houston sixth. One out later, Bill Doran doubled down the 
right-field line to score Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 1, San Diego 0 -- Robby Thompson's triple, one of only two Giant 
hits off Ed Whitson, and a sacrifice fly by Will Clark in the third inning were 
enough to beat the Padres at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants ended Whitson's seven game-winning streak. Whitson (9-3) also gave 
up an infield single by Tracy Jones in the second inning. Whitson walked two 
and struck out two in his first loss since April 22. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Garrelts (5-1) gave up six hits in six innings, striking out six and 
walking none. The right-hander left the game because of tightness in his 
pitching elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 9, Philadelphia 1 -- Tim Raines' pinch three-run double highlighted a 
five-run sixth inning, and Bryn Smith pitched a five-hitter as the Expos beat 
the Phillies at Montreal to move within a game of first place in the National 
League East. 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brooks had two RBI doubles and Tim Wallach drove in two runs with a 
double and a single. The Expos had 15 hits, three by Brooks, and tied a team 
record with eight doubles. The Phillies have lost 13 of 16. 
</P>
<P>
Smith (6-2) struck out nine and walked none for his third complete game. Bruce 
Ruffin (0-3) gave up eight hits and two earned runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Chicago 0 -- Joe Magrane pitched a six-hitter for his first 
complete game of the season, and Tony Pena drove in three runs as the Cardinals 
shut out the Cubs for the second straight day at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane (4-5) ended a personal three-game losing streak with his sixth career 
shutout. The left-hander struck out nine, a career high, and walked two.

DEMOTION AFTER A SHUTOUT SURPRISES RAMON MARTINEZ 
</P>

Ramon Martinez thought pitching a complete-game shutout against the Atlanta 
Braves would be enough to keep him on the Dodgers' staff. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't, but Martinez is confident he'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
"I proved to a lot of people that I can pitch in the big leagues. I hope to be 
back soon," he said after rejoining the Albuquerque Dukes, the Dodgers' 
Triple-A farm club. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, 21, a right-hander from the Dominican Republic, was called up a week 
ago to give the weary Dodger pitching staff some rest. His nine-inning 
performance Monday night proved even more important after the Dodger pitching 
staff worked 35 innings in two games Saturday night and Sunday against the 
Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who was 1-3 in six starts for the Dodgers during the pennant run last 
season, gave up just six hits and one walk while striking out nine to earn the 
7-0 victory en route to a Dodger sweep of the doubleheader in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"My fastball had very good location and my changeup was real good," Martinez 
said. "I just threw my game -- nice and relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, 8-1 this season with the Dukes, was prepared for a lengthy stay with 
the Dodgers and left Albuquerque last weekend with all his belongings 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't tell me anything about one start," he said. "They told me I was 
going up and to take everything I own." 
</P>
<P>
But after pitching the shutout Monday night, he received word he was headed 
back to Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big surprise," he said. "When I pitched that game, I really thought 
I was going to stay there. I'm disappointed, but there's nothing I can do about 
it. They called me and I did the job." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said Dodger executives have told him they would prefer to have him in 
the minors as a starter than in the bullpen in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, in his fifth year in the Dodgers organization, said for the time 
being he prefers playing with the Dukes rather than traveling back and forth 
between Albuquerque and Los Angeles. "I don't care when they bring me up. I 
just want to go up there and stay there."

WOMAN, 20, IS FATALLY SHOT IN HEARNS' HOME; 
</P>
<P>
BOXER SAYS FIGHT WON'T BE AFFECTED; BROTHER AT POLICE STATION IN MICHIGAN

An unidentified woman was shot to death in a bedroom of boxer Thomas Hearns' 
home in Southfield, Mich., Saturday night, and six witnesses were being 
questioned, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the boxer's brothers was at the police station, accompanied by defense 
attorney Neil Fink, but Southfield Police Officer Gary Conat refused to say if 
Henry Hearns, about 19, was among those being questioned, the Associated Press 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Lloyd Collins of the Southfield Police Department told The Times early 
Sunday that police had a suspect in custody. He said he could not identify the 
suspect until after an arraignment, which was scheduled for later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Bob Arum said late Saturday night that Hearns would meet Sugar Ray 
Leonard Monday night, as scheduled, in a 12-round bout for Leonard's World 
Boxing Council super-middleweight title at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Arum said he went to Hearns' hotel suite, where he found Hearns, several 
members of his camp and Hearns' mother, Lois, who he said was crying. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy was angry at me for coming by and he said to me: 'This is not going to 
affect me. Look, I'm here to do a job -- I've been waiting eight years to knock 
this guy out.' " 
</P>
<P>
The dead woman, whose name was not released, was shot once in the head, Collins 
said. She was in her 20s and was known to the Hearns family, but the fighter 
did not know her well, Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives found a gun they believed was used in the slaying, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said Southfield, a suburb two miles north of Detroit, is considered a 
"quiet community." He said the neighborhood of the shooting rarely has 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
"Incidents are incidents and they're unfortunate, but we're all professionals 
here," Arum told Associated Press. "Is he (Hearns) concerned about his brother? 
He probably is, but he says he doesn't want to think about it, and he won't." 
</P>
<P>
Arum said three people in Hearns' entourage left Las Vegas for Detroit, 
including another younger brother, John Hearns, who is a student at the 
University of Nevada Las Vegas. His mother will remain in Las Vegas for the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy talked to her and asked her to stay in Las Vegas," Arum said. "She is 
here and she is going to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Arum said: "It has been made clear to me that the (dead) woman herself has 
absolutely no connection with Thomas." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he knew that since he didn't know the victim's name, he said, "They 
apparently know who she is." 
</P>
<P>
Prentiss Byrd, chief assistant to Emanuel Steward, Hearns' manager, quoted the 
former world champion as saying: "I've got to do what I've got to do. A lot of 
people worked to make this fight happen." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard told Charlie Brotman, a publicist: "I don't know any of the details, 
but I certainly feel empathy for him, especially in light of the big 
championship fight." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Elliott Almond contributed to this story.

ANALYSIS;

<P>
A LOOK AT SPORTS AND SPONSORSHIP IN THE '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN DENLINGER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Purity in sport keeps getting clobbered by dollar bills -- and the longer the 
flogging goes on, the more do sensible people applaud. Washingtonians 
experience the roots of this pleasant excess in their minds after Sunday's 
Indianapolis 500 and in person at the Kemper Open this week. 
</P>
<P>
Silly and serious was the business of getting the proper hat on Emerson 
Fittipaldi and a couple of swigs of milk over his lips the instant he popped 
from that 200-mile-per-hour billboard in Victory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers have been selling their bodies (and their souls, many say) more 
aggressively for more years than any other athletes, the simple reason being 
necessity. They own themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody else has been playing catch-up as quickly as possible, with a lot of 
us witnesses puzzled and troubled about it. With a few tasteless exceptions, 
this money explosion in sports has been fine. 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, a few civic-minded businesses could use some selling lessons from golf 
and help save money-strapped high school sports. They could sponsor Interhigh 
games; they could sponsor Interhigh teams. All that keeps it from happening 
might be prissy posture, too many noses turned too high just now. 
</P>
<P>
Sports long have been separated by standards. What's okay for golf is terrible 
for basketball. And what's accepted at one level of athletic education is not 
at another. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, Sam Snead won the Anthracite Open; a year later, he prevailed in the 
Henry Hurst Invitational. So Glen Campbell and the Gatlin Brothers did not 
invent celebrity golf after all. 
</P>
<P>
Snead, Ben Hogan and far earlier golfers who followed the sun for a living 
would have entered putting contests in a wind tunnel if the price were right. 
Long-driving contests are in fashion once more, bankrolled by an imaginative 
long distance phone company, MCI. 
</P>
<P>
Truth be known, all that remains unsponsored in golf are the hazards. And some 
waste management company just might get involved there. 
</P>
<P>
If golf were less tame, its promoters might try a boxing stunt. Legend has it 
that one bright hustler tried to sell ad space on the bottom of his bum's 
shoes, on the near-certain chance they would be in full and unswaying view for 
at least 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Even many obscure pros arrive each day at Avenel in sponsor cars. They proceed 
to the course in sponsor shoes, sponsor socks, sponsor slacks, sponsor shirts 
and sponsor visors. They hit sponsor balls with sponsor clubs on holes 
patrolled by sponsor courses. 
</P>
<P>
The real real estate in big-time golf now is not the middle of the fairway but 
out of bounds, those glitzy homes and condos that make it possible for the pros 
to own the land on which they play. 
</P>
<P>
What's the harm? 
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists are sad that a wonderful course just up the road, 
Congressional, was abandoned for one of those made-to-order stadium sites that 
seem to clutter the tour. 
</P>
<P>
For Washington area golfers, Avenel is a distinctive addition to our many and 
varied courses. Besides, it keeps more of the well-heeled riffraff off Redgate 
and our other public course treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has become golflike in many ways, the Super Bowl having evolved into 
the focal point of 12 dozen corporate outings. Still, pro football is a better 
game than ever; Bill Walsh's 49ers would beat Vince Lombardi's Packers. And men 
who have devoted three-quarters of their lives to football now can retire 
comfortably from it. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympics have gone corporate, over the long and loud protests of Avery 
Brundage and lots of other elitists. Look what's happened: athletes are 
running, jumping and throwing better than ever -- and doing it far longer than 
was possible a couple of Olympiads ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, fuss over corporate intrusion in sport has hit college sport, football 
especially. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl and the USF&amp;G Sugar Bowl gives these 
holiday binges more of a sacred flair than they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Cal now endows football positions. Fat-cat boosters are buying left 
inside linebackers and tight ends. That at last removes all hypocrisy from the 
buy-a-player process still called "educational foundations" at most schools. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech recently tried an innovation where corporations would underwrite 
games -- and got roundly spanked for it by the same folks who want college 
players to get more money. 
</P>
<P>
How else is that going to happen? If the colleges wisely vote to give players a 
couple of hundred bucks a month, some way of raising it must be found. Or 
deserving sports dropped. 
</P>
<P>
I would not be offended by, say, the Safeway Maryland-Penn State football game. 
No more than I am by the Shearson Lehman Hutton Andy Williams Open. Or I would 
be by the Cadillac Masters, so long as the proper players still honor their 
craft at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
No one objects to youth leagues being subsidized, to kids wearing T-shirts with 
such as "Powl's Feed Service" or "Clyde's Auto Parts" stenciled prominently. At 
some point, sponsoring players, and giving them a fair piece of the action, 
becomes a sporting sin.

CHANG'S FINAL CHALLENGE IS EDBERG IN FRENCH FINAL

The days have gone quickly for Michael Chang these last two weeks on the same 
red clay where victory has come so slowly for American men. 
</P>
<P>
If he wins today, he may even think about it sometime. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have time to think about it now," Chang said. "I know it's definitely 
been a great two weeks. And I know it's definitely going to be with me later. 
But I'm going to have to do my thinking later." 
</P>
<P>
The greatest two weeks of Chang's career end today at Stade Roland Garros, 
where the 17-year-old from Placentia plays 23-year-old Stefan Edberg of Sweden 
in the final of the French Open for a $291,752 winner's share. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg is ranked No. 3 in the world, and Chang is ranked No. 19. 
</P>
<P>
If Chang wins, he will be the first American man to win here since Tony Trabert 
defeated Sven Davidson of Sweden in four sets in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Chang is the youngest French Open finalist and only the fifth American man in 
the Open era to advance this far. The others were Harold Solomon (1976), Brian 
Gottfried (1977), Vitas Gerulaitis (1980) and John McEnroe (1984). 
</P>
<P>
They all lost, Solomon to Adriano Panatta of Italy, Gottfried to Guillermo 
Vilas of Argentina, Gerulaitis to Bjorn Borg of Sweden and McEnroe to Ivan 
Lendl of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
"Records are made to be broken," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
If Chang is a surprise finalist, so, too, is Edberg, who hopes to continue a 
recent Swedish tradition in this tournament. Borg won in 1974-75 and 1978-81. 
Mats Wilander won in 1982, '85 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
Chang and Edberg have met three times, and Edberg has won two, although Chang 
won the last time they played, 6-3, 6-2, on the hard courts at Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
"That was not one of my happiest moments on a tennis court," Edberg said, "so I 
have to give it to him on that surface. Right now, he's playing very well and 
with a lot of confidence."

TENNIS / THOMAS BONK;

NO MATTER THE FRENCH RESULTS, WIMBLEDON IS ISLAND UNTO ITSELF

<P>
The French Open comes to an end today, which means it's time to say goodby to 
red clay for another year and wonder if anything at all that happened on it 
will mean anything at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably not," Bud Collins said. "From the results at the French, you can tell 
who's earnest, but that's about it. I mean, (Mats) Wilander won here (last 
year) and he was earnest, but it didn't do him any good at Wimbledon." 
</P>
<P>
Collins, a commentator for NBC and a columnist for the Boston Globe, is never 
short of opinion. He has written a book called "My Life With the Pros," an 
account of his television and newspaper career covering professional tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Collins has already handicapped Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"(Boris) Becker, I would think, would be a big favorite," he said. "And (John) 
McEnroe is always a major figure, I think. Unfortunately, he was playing so 
well and then everything was set back because of his back injury. 
</P>
<P>
"But you never know with him, either. He played so well here last year and then 
stunk things up at Wimbledon." 
</P>
<P>
Known for a sharp wit, his colorful nicknames for players -- Steffi Graf is 
Fraulein Forehand -- and his often outrageous attire, Collins began covering 
tennis in 1955 for the Boston Herald. 
</P>
<P>
"My sports editor assigned me to it and he was very apologetic about it," 
Collins said. "Everybody knew the tennis beat was always given to the new man, 
the staff drunk or an old guy they were phasing out. My daughter asked me which 
one of the three I was." 
</P>
<P>
Collins later added television as another vehicle for his commentary, which 
seemed only natural, and now his bearded, smiling face is a familiar sight, 
especially at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the key tennis event for people who catch only one tournament a 
year," he said. "Wimbledon -- it's so much a mystery, it's got this natural 
attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Because McEnroe probably attracts more attention than any player in the world, 
when he plays the most important tennis tournament in the world, the interest 
in him is staggering. Last year, McEnroe made the round of 16 at Roland Garros, 
but lost in the second round at Wimbledon, which reminded Collins of a story. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said he ran into Bjorn Borg and asked him how McEnroe could play so 
well on clay and so poorly on grass. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it's easy," Borg told Collins. "He's slow now. He's not fast enough for 
grass, so he doesn't mind the slow clay." 
</P>
<P>
Collins' book is full of such anecdotes culled from his television and 
newspaper career. He is mostly pleased with the finished product, but thinks it 
may have one shortcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"Not enough sex," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shop talk: Michael Chang said if he weren't playing tennis for a career, he'd 
probably get a job in freshwater marine research. 
</P>
<P>
The night his match against Jim Courier was suspended because of darkness, 
three bags of food from McDonald's were rushed to Andre Agassi in the players' 
clubhouse at Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi was hungry. He was also homesick. After a week in Rome and two weeks in 
France, Agassi talked a good fight but played as if he didn't want to be here 
while he was losing to Courier. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi took the first flight home to Las Vegas. He reaffirmed his decision to 
omit Wimbledon from his schedule and came up with the quote of the tournament 
before he departed: "Mats wants to win it, Lendl wants to win it, I just want 
to go home." 
</P>
<P>
Unless he changes his plans, Agassi will not play another competitive match 
until the Davis Cup. That means Agassi won't have played for six weeks before 
the U.S. showdown against West Germany, July 21-23 in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he couldn't wait to leave, Agassi said he felt better appreciated 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that I get the best response from the Europeans," he said. "I 
depend on the U.S. for criticism. (Pause) Constructive criticism. (Pause) 
Supposedly. (Pause) I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
In the yearly vote of French tennis reporters, the winner of the orange award 
for the most pleasant player at the French Open was Jakob Hlasek of 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
The lemon award, for the sourest player, went to Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I won something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
First Steffi Graf, then Monica Seles, now . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
With the accent on youth in the women's ranks at the French Open, a Florida 
girl one month past her 13th birthday has drawn a lot of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Capriati of Lauderhill, a finalist in the junior girls singles at 
Roland Garros, is waiting until she can turn pro at 14. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati's parents petitioned the Women's International Tennis Assn. to allow 
her to turn pro at 12, but the WITA stood by its rule that a player must be at 
least 14. 
</P>
<P>
The lone dissenting vote was cast by WITA board member Chris Evert, whose 
father, Jimmy, was Capriati's first coach at Holiday Park in Ft. Lauderdale.

THE '80S LACKED A SUPERSTAR AS FOREIGN GOLFERS TOOK CONTROL

<P>
If there is a theme to golf in the 1980's, it has developed in the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It is "us vs. them," American vs. foreign. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little in recent history to provide a hint as to a probable winner 
of the 89th U.S. Open championship which begins Thursday at Oak Hill's East 
course. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no clearly dominant individual player in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish star won four of golf's major events -- the U.S. and British Opens, 
the Masters and the PGA -- in the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Watson won five. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman? Sandy Lyle? Nick Faldo? 
</P>
<P>
Norman, an Australian, won one major, Scotland's Lyle and England's Faldo two 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus and Larry Nelson each won three in the decade and Ray Floyd won 
two. 
</P>
<P>
The American victories, however, generally came early in the decade, the 
triumphs of the foreign players in later years. 
</P>
<P>
The last of Watson's major wins was in 1983. Two of Nelson's were before '84. 
Two of Nicklaus' three were in 1980. Nicklaus now is 49, Floyd 46, Nelson 41 
and Watson 39. 
</P>
<P>
Among the foreigners, however, Ballesteros won as recently as last year's 
British Open, Lyle in the 1988 Masters and Faldo in the '86 British Open and 
this year's Masters. And all three are in their golfing prime, their early 
30's. 
</P>
<P>
The direction of the swing appears obvious, and has been highlighted by 
European victories over America's best in the last two Ryder Cup Matches in 
1985 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign-born players have won half the Masters played in the 80s and the last 
five British Opens. 
</P>
<P>
That domination has not extended to the American national championship, 
however. Of the U.S. Open winners in the '80s, only David Graham is not a 
native Ameican and the Australian has had his residence in this country the 
entire 10 years. He is one of only three foreign players to win the U.S. Open 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But there are indications that, too, could be in for a change. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several names that come to mind immediately; the ones you always 
think of," Curtis Strange said when asked about logical contenders for the 
title he won in such dramatic fashion last year in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
He ticked them off: 
</P>
<P>
"Seve (Ballesteros), and Greg (Norman), and Faldo." 
</P>
<P>
Strange paused for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think especially Nick. He's playing so well. Yeah. He's the one," Strange 
said. "I think he's the odds-on favorite. And not just because he won the 
Masters. He's played well for two years." 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, of course, lost to Strange in the U.S. Open playoff last year, was third 
in the British Open and fourth in the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the 6-foot-3 Englishman's record is the best in the world. It is 
centered on his playoff victory in the Masters but was enhanced by consecutive 
triumphs in the British PGA (a record-matching fourth for Faldo) and the 
British Masters (a five-stroke run-away) in his last two starts. 
</P>
<P>
The moody, mercurial Ballesteros has won only the Madrid Open this year, but 
seems to save his best efforts for the game's major events. 
</P>
<P>
"My game is not 100 percent, but then it never is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman also has won only abroad over the last 12 months and is fully aware that 
recent lack of success has raised questions about his stature as one of the 
world's great players. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle is in the throes of the worst slump of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Over here," Strange said, continuing his analysis of potential successors, "I 
expect (Mark) Calcavecchia to show up. 
</P>
<P>
"(Tom) Kite is always around. 
</P>
<P>
"And Lanny (Wadkins). Lanny's game seems to be a little off right now, but he 
always gets charged up for the Open. 
</P>
<P>
"He just needs something to get the blood flowing. The Open just might be the 
right medicine for him." Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia has cooled off after scoring two early-season victories. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, the American Tour's leading money-winner, scored consecutive victories in 
Florida, including the important Players championship. 
</P>
<P>
But some recent, inconsistent putting prompted him to go to a cross-handed 
technique in the Westchester Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced it's a good, solid, sound method of putting. The worst thing 
about it is its perception as being the last resort," Kite said. 
</P>
<P>
Strange, who collected four titles and more than $1 million in official 
earnings last year, has not won this season. He's had four third-place 
finishes, including three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"But I feel pretty good about my game," he said after a two-week break from 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's coming around. I've been playing some pretty good rounds. I just need to 
be more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I've thought a lot about last year and the Open. It was the 
highlight of my career. 
</P>
<P>
"But it wasn't the best I've played. I've played better than that. The thing 
was that I squeezed every stroke I could out of it. That's patience, and 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what you have to have in the Open." 
</P>
<P>
Strange said he'd probably overlooked a couple of players in his list of 
possible contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Tway could fit that category. He ended a two-year victory drought at the 
Memorial and followed it up two weeks later with a playoff loss at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The 150-man field also will include 49-year-old Lee Trevino, who scored his 
first professional victory here in the 1968 U.S. Open, the last time the 
American national championship was held at Oak Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The classic old Donald Ross course has undergone two revisions since then, once 
by Robert Trent Jones and once by George Fazio. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long, hard golf course," said Strange, who played it in the 1980 PGA. 
"You absolutely have to put the ball in the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
"It just like all the Opens. You have to drive it good and be patient. That's 
the game in the Open. 
</P>
<P>
"My only hope is that the weather is okay. If the weather is bad, then it's 
just going to be a matter of survival." 
</P>
<P>
Missing from the field will be Arnold Palmer, who failed to qualify, and a 
couple of recent Tour title-winners, Ian Baker-Finch and Tom Byrum. 
</P>
<P>
Finch forgot to send in his entry. Byrum missed a flight after scoring his 
first career victory in the Kemper Open and failed to make his tee time for an 
Open qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
The final two rounds Saturday and Sunday will be televised nationally by ABC.

The University of South Carolina has agreed to report verifiable results of all 
drug tests involving athletes, making it one of the first National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. schools to do so, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any other school that does that, even though we encourage 
them to," said Frank Urysz, NCAA director of sports sciences. "If more schools 
would be out front with information about their testing programs, I think 
allegations of mismanagement would cease." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA publishes annual results of its postseason screening, Urysz said.

Favored Aliysa broke away from the field in the final two furlongs to win the 
English Oaks turf race for fillies in near-record time at Epsom, England. 
</P>
<P>
Aliysa, the 11-10 choice ridden by Walter Swinburn, stumbled coming out of the 
gate and was boxed in along the rail for much of the race. But she sped past 
front-running Mamaluna in the final straight and won by three lengths over Snow 
Bride. 
</P>
<P>
Aliysa's time of 2:34.22 was only one-hundredth of a second off the Oaks record

LABONTE HOPES FOR SMOOTH RUN IN ROAD RACE AT SEARS POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SONOMA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Labonte's first look at Sears Point International Raceway was irrelevant 
because he already knew how he would attack the demanding road course. 
</P>
<P>
"Being smooth is the key," the former Winston Cup champion, one of the best 
road racers in NASCAR's premier stock car series, said. "You've got to be 
smooth running on a road course, maybe more so than on an oval track." 
</P>
<P>
Labonte is seeking his first victory of the season today on the 2.52-mile 
circuit in the Banquet Foods 300-kilometer (187-mile) race. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first of only two road races on the 29-event NASCAR schedule and the 
first Winston Cup event ever at Sears Points. 
</P>
<P>
"When you watch drivers on a road course, I guarantee you all the people who 
run fast look like they're running slow," Labonte said. "The ones who are all 
over the place and look like they're really running -- smoking the tires, 
throwing it sideways in the corners -- aren't going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go into a corner and downshift, you have to do that smoothly so that 
it doesn't upset the car," he added. "You've got to know when to use the brakes 
going into the corner, and when to get off of them." 
</P>
<P>
Labonte, who got in his first practice laps Thursday, said, "I love going to a 
track for the first time. Everyone is equal as far as experience on that track 
with these cars. If I had to make a choice of racing one weekend on a new 
track, I'd pick a road course every time. I wish we had a few more on our 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Another of NASCAR's best road racers, Rusty Wallace, got an early look at Sears 
Points, a factor which could give last year's second-place finisher in the 
Winston Cup points race a little edge in today's opening round of qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, defending series champion Bill Elliott and Mark Martin tested their 
cars here in May, while several other drivers took the Sears Point driving 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Testing with my own car is going to mean everything here at Sears Point," 
Wallace said. "I expect that the three cars that tested here will be up very, 
very high in qualifying, if not on the front row. Even those who took the 
driving school will have some advantage of at least knowing the track. 
</P>
<P>
"It requires different driving tactics that those of us who tested will know 
going into practice."

BEACH BUMS NO MORE, VOLLEYBALL PROS TURN SAND TO GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Hanseth got dinner and a trophy for winning the prestigious Laguna Beach 
Open volleyball tournament in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"That was pretty good for then," says Jim Menges, who dominated the beach game 
from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s. Menges' payday for winning the 
Hermosa Beach Open with partner Matt Gage in 1980 was frozen yogurt and a 
pitcher of beer. 
</P>
<P>
How things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
Today's "King of the Beach," Sinjin Smith, is well on his way to becoming the 
first millionaire in beach volleyball -- a sport in which prize money for top 
players has increased more than 400% since 1985. Six players won over $100,000 
on the tour last season. 
</P>
<P>
That's a lot of frozen yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and partner Randy Stoklos won $134,185 apiece last summer to top the 
Assn. of Volleyball Professionals money standings. But Smith's growing wealth 
has as much to do with diversity as it does athletic prowess. The winningest 
player in beach volleyball history has a lucrative deal with a clothing 
manufacturer, a coming book and instructional video, and an anticipated part in 
a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
Coming soon is a video game featuring the likenesses of Smith and Stoklos 
called, naturally, "Kings of the Beach." 
</P>
<P>
So how is this portfolio received by the local media when the AVP tour rolls 
into Chicago, Cleveland and Rochester, N.Y. -- cities where the stars of a 
quirky California sport might be expected to have amassed some fame, but 
certainly not a fortune? 
</P>
<P>
Smith laughs. "They just can't believe guys who grew up on the beach, play in 
the sand, get tan and run around with no shirts on can get paid $150,000 or 
$200,000 to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But some do. And things aren't bad on the lower rungs of the money ladder, 
either. After 16 years of playing for trophies and (sometimes) dinner, the game 
has finally begun to pay off for Hanseth, at 36 the elder statesman of 
professional beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Hanseth won $35,002 on the tour last season, good for 12th place in the money 
standings. To earn what many deem a good living, he managed just one 
third-place finish and twice came in fourth, but more often took fifth, 
seventh, ninth, even 13th. And the Santa Barbara resident was aware of the talk 
among some of the sport's young lions that the time had come for him to step 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to quit. They're going to have to boot me out of the way," 
Hanseth said. "The way I look at it, I still enjoy what I'm doing, I'm still 
competitive. So why not make $35,000 or $40,000 for playing volleyball on 
weekends when I'd be at the beach or on a tennis court anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
For Menges, who is just two years older than Hanseth but quit the beach game in 
1982, the timing of volleyball's new professionalism was not so fortuitous. 
Menges was there when the money arrived, winning beach volleyball's first two 
World Championship events -- in 1976 with Greg Lee and in 1977 with Chris 
Marlowe -- for a total of $2,500 in prize money. In one five-year stretch, he 
failed to finish third or better in just one tournament, and that was a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have had to work again," said Menges, who recently entered the 
real estate field in Orange County after years of going from one job to the 
next. "But that's just how things progressed. Now, you get seventh place every 
weekend and make $35,000." 
</P>
<P>
Menges could have added to that sponsorship and endorsement packages from 
beachwear manufacturers that cover a player's travel expenses and may pay him a 
base salary -- contracts that can double or even triple a top player's income 
from winnings. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ever got was free trunks," Menges said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Smith got part ownership of a beachwear company. 
</P>
<P>
It's more than a little symbolic that the guru of beach volleyball can no 
longer be found on the sand courts south of Manhattan Beach pier or north of 
Santa Monica, but instead occupies a law office on the 12th floor of a Century 
City high rise. Leonard Armato, attorney for the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
and Phoenix Suns guard Kevin Johnson, is credited with taking the game uptown. 
</P>
<P>
And, he says, there's no reason to stop at the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Beach volleyball can go as far as just about any sport out there," says 
Armato, the organizer and executive director of the AVP, whose latest coup was 
obtaining nationwide cable television coverage of all 29 tournaments on this 
year's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"When you keep in mind that volleyball is the second most popular sport in the 
world, you know the beach game will continue to grow by leaps and bounds. It's 
a good spectator sport and, with the exposure it's getting this year on 
television, I think you're going to see it explode." 
</P>
<P>
Armato's enthusiasm for the sport appears to go beyond the standard hype of an 
agent or promoter. A former top-rated volleyball player himself, the 
36-year-old sports lawyer graduated from Mira Costa High School in Manhattan 
Beach and played on the sand courts at the foot of Marine Avenue (known to the 
locals as "Marine Street"). The same information can be found in the AVP bios 
of veteran beach stars Mike Dodd and Jon Stevenson, among others. 
</P>
<P>
So it's not surprising that the players came to Armato in 1983 when they became 
dissatisfied with their original promoter, Event Concepts. 
</P>
<P>
Money, at the time, was still new to beach volleyball. According to former 
player Jon Lee, now a volleyball writer and historian, prize money was 
introduced to the game in a manner reminiscent of pro wrestling or 
turn-of-the-century boxing. In the early 1970s, Jim Bartlett, a young publisher 
and entrepreneur with a taste for beach volleyball, decided to make things more 
interesting by placing a "bounty" on the top teams, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each team would enter the tournament with bounties on their heads and, if you 
beat them, you would win the bounty," said Lee, who coaches volleyball at a 
Santa Barbara high school. "If the team won, they would retain their bounty." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Event Concepts that recognized the promotional power of beach 
volleyball and introduced a more sophisticated method of compensating the 
players. In 1976, the firm persuaded a corporate sponsor to put up a $5,000 
purse for the first World Championship tournament and "professional" beach 
volleyball was born. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years Event Concepts promoted the beach tour, expanding corporate 
sponsorship, modestly increasing the prize money and attracting the first cable 
television coverage. But all was not well. The players, Dodd said at the time, 
were "tired of being treated like nets and poles." They wanted more control and 
more money. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Armato. Under the direction of the attorney, the players formed the AVP 
and, thus, became a single bargaining unit, one unified voice. And when Event 
Concepts failed to meet the AVP's demands in the summer of 1984, the players 
went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
The aftermath of the AVP's boycott of the 1984 World Championship tournament in 
Hermosa Beach brought total victory to the players. Event Concepts was out, the 
corporate sponsors were persuaded to stay and the players had control of beach 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, (Event Concepts) was doomed from the start," Hanseth said. "They 
saw the potential first; they saw thousands of people (attending tournaments) 
and no money being made, and they brought in the sponsors. But eventually we 
asked, 'What are they really offering us? Why not start a players' union, hire 
our own promoter and give him a salary?' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Armato, the AVP did just that for the next three years, hiring 
another promoter, Group Dynamics Inc., and expanding the tour to 25 events and 
$600,000 in prize money. But after the 1987 season, the players decided to cut 
out the middle man altogether and promote the tour themselves, dealing directly 
with the sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"The AVP felt it could maximize the visibility of the sponsor and maximize the 
benefit to the players without having the money diluted by a third party," 
Armato said. "And the prize money went from several hundred thousand dollars to 
over a million overnight." 
</P>
<P>
These results -- coupled with the AVP's corporate expansion into areas such as 
merchandising, publishing and concessions -- have increased the players' 
loyalty to Armato and their faith in his leadership, according to Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made all the right moves," Stevenson said. "He's made good decisions, 
just about all of them have paid off and we're looking forward to what the 
future may hold." 
</P>
<P>
So is Armato, who predicts that television will allow volleyball to overcome 
the limitations a beach sport might anticipate in a world that is largely 
landlocked. 
</P>
<P>
"Hockey is not as transmittable to television as volleyball is," said Armato, 
who has already introduced the beach game to the shores of Lake Michigan and, 
by bringing truckloads of sand to city parks, to places where there is no beach 
of any kind. "And if television can do what it did for golf -- the most boring 
sport in the history of the world -- imagine what it can do for us. 
</P>
<P>
"Volleyball has all the elements: fast action, guys diving, guys with no 
shirts, the sun, the beach, girls in bikinis. It's perfect for television." 
</P>
<P>
Jon Stevenson calls them the "thirtysomething guys." Smith, Dodd, Tim Hovland, 
Pat Powers, Steve Obradovich, Hanseth and Stevenson himself. They are all 30 or 
older and dominate what is still perceived by many as a young man's game -- 
meant to be played by teen-agers during those long summer days before they must 
confront the realities of life. 
</P>
<P>
The "thirtysomething guys" still play, Stevenson says, because they still win. 
"It was just a generation of really good volleyball players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he allows that their continued presence also has a lot to do with 
perspective. The older players remember when a "career" in beach volleyball 
meant sacrificing other real career opportunities. Some of life's realities 
might not have been so bad, and casting them aside for a game that offered no 
real future seemed unwise. 
</P>
<P>
"People can't believe we're making this kind of money," said Stevenson, 31, 
another $100,000 winner last season. "But for five years, I wasn't making more 
than $10,000 or $20,000. Since college (at UC Santa Barbara), I always 
considered going into the mainstream. I even did my first year of a master's 
program in business. But I stuck with volleyball and it finally paid off." 
</P>
<P>
"You just had to make a decision in life," said Dodd, Stevenson's teammate at 
Mira Costa High who also survived the lean years to become a $100,000 player. 
"If you were a young guy, you would scratch out a living at a job that allowed 
you to go to the beach in the daytime. A lot of people worked in restaurants or 
did real estate." 
</P>
<P>
Those who remain from those days are the lucky ones, Stevenson says. "We're the 
first guys who really made money at it. We're the ones who put our asses on the 
line and went on strike, who gave up all those career opportunities to play 
volleyball. We don't want to give it up yet. We want to go as long as we can." 
</P>
<P>
But has the game changed along with the prize money? 
</P>
<P>
"I think just about everything has changed," Stevenson said. "The only thing 
that hasn't is that you still hit the ball three times." 
</P>
<P>
Though he agrees with Smith, who stresses that "once you step onto the court, 
it's the same game now as it was then," Stevenson is as wistful for 
volleyball's past as he is enthusiastic about its prosperous present. 
</P>
<P>
"The spirit is just not there any more," he said. "It used to be more tied up 
with the subculture of the beach. It used to be tied in with going to the 
beach, surfing and having fun. Now, people are playing for different reasons. I 
don't think many guys out there are not playing for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell things have changed just by the conversation amongst the players. 
It used to be, 'Where's the party?' and 'Who did you sleep with last night?' 
Now, it's about permits for retaining walls, remodeling houses, stocks going up 
or down. It's an entirely different set of topics." 
</P>
<P>
The results of the increased money, however, go well beyond court-side 
conversation. "The big difference," Smith says, "is that it's much more 
competitive out there. It used to be, 10 years ago or so, you could skate 
through Saturday's games (before the final rounds Sunday). Now, you can't take 
anyone lightly." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson agrees. "The depth of competition has really increased," he said. 
"There are about 20 top-quality teams right now. All the way down to the 
40th-ranked teams, you find players who are real serious about making it a 
career. They're doing the little things -- diet, jump-training, lifting weights 
-- to try to improve their game." 
</P>
<P>
And if they make it, the "little things" will include negotiating with sponsors 
over contract clauses, modeling beachwear for photo shoots and catching long 
commercial airline flights. AVP events, sponsored by beer and tequila 
companies, are now held in the target marketing regions for those products 
rather than traditional volleyball beaches like Laguna, State (north of Santa 
Monica) and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the whole transition," Stevenson says. "Guys like Jim Menges and Matt 
Gage were every bit as good as the top players today, and it's amazing they 
could sacrifice as much as they did and get nothing back except personal 
prestige." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Coast Highway is volleyball's answer to the Hollywood "Walk of Fame," 
passing all the game's legendary outposts as it meanders along the coastline 
from Orange County to Santa Barbara. And in the 1960s and 1970s, the stars 
shone brightest on a short stretch of beach north of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of Chautauqua Boulevard, State Beach sits in the morning shadow of 
Pacific Palisades. This was once home to Ron Von Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
The legendary Von Hagen, now a 50-year-old businessman in Idaho, won 62 
tournaments between 1965 and 1975, despite never playing more than 10 
tournaments in a summer. He's still No. 3 on the all-time win list in an era of 
30-event seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A half-mile to the south, between State Beach and Santa Monica, is Sorrento 
Beach, where Jim Menges once ruled. For Menges, his long-time partner Greg Lee 
and the dozen or more other players who gathered daily at Sorrento, volleyball 
certainly was not a livelihood. But it was their life. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played beach volleyball," Menges said, in terms befitting the 
simplicity of the time. "That's what we liked to do." 
</P>
<P>
Menges had much success at just playing volleyball. His 43 tournament victories 
place him sixth on the all-time list behind Smith, Stoklos, Von Hagen, Dodd and 
Hovland. (Hovland passed him this season.) And he has that fond memory of 
reuniting with Lee in 1982, near the end of both of their careers, to win a 
tournament in San Diego. Among their victims on that weekend were guys named 
Smith, Stoklos, Dodd and Hovland. 
</P>
<P>
But it was those days on Sorrento Beach that were the sweetest. "There were 15 
or 20 of us and we'd go to Sorrento and play," he recalls. "I went to UCLA on a 
volleyball scholarship and scheduled my classes for the morning. (After leaving 
UCLA) I worked in a restaurant at night. And during those years I was playing 
volleyball six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd play all afternoon and then we'd watch the sunset. It was a social 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
For Jon Lee, who played more than 10 years but never as successfully as brother 
Greg, money would have been nice, but the "esprit de corps" of the old 
volleyball circuit may have been worth more. 
</P>
<P>
"There was less material benefit," he said. "It was all pride and position in 
the subculture that motivated you. It was just the respect of your peers and 
love of the sport that you were playing for. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd work in restaurants at night, play volleyball in the day and then, on 
the weekends, the party would travel to San Diego, Corona (del Mar), Santa 
Cruz, Santa Barbara. It was a nice life. I cherish the memories and the image 
that volleyball had then."

EX-ROLLING HILLS CAGER JAY BILAS HAS BOUNCED TO UNEXPECTED PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's fair to say Jay Bilas has had an eventful year, having been branded a 
basketball Benedict Arnold in Spain, been dunked over by a 4-foot-2 child 
prodigy in a TV commericial, then having spent several months as an alien life 
form in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
And that was all by Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
The career of the former Rolling Hills High basketball star will soon take 
another turn when he returns to Duke University as an assistant basketball 
coach while pursuing his law degree. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, since his collegiate career ended at Duke, that's 
been the way the Bilas bounces. In that relatively short time he has played two 
and a half seasons as a basketball pro in Europe, done radio and television 
commentary, performed in two television commercials, taken the law SAT exam and 
acted in a science fiction adventure movie to be released later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say my life's been back and forth," Bilas said last week in a brief 
hometown stopover. "My resume looks pretty diverse." 
</P>
<P>
Though he summers in the South Bay, Bilas was out of sight for most of his 
first two years after college, playing professionally in Verona, Italy, where 
he regained his scoring touch and played against the likes of former Laker Bob 
McAdoo. 
</P>
<P>
Bilas has been more recognizable lately. He can currently be seen in two 
television commercials -- for Minolta cameras and Budweiser, playing basketball 
in both. 
</P>
<P>
To show he's not typecast, Bilas also will be seen in an upcoming Dolph 
Lundgren movie tentatively titled "Dark Angel." Bilas just returned from 
filming in Houston, where he played an alien policeman. The role was a stretch 
for a ballplayer, even one from the rugged Atlantic Coast Conference. "I don't 
kill anybody but I blow up a lot of things," Bilas confided. 
</P>
<P>
Personable and articulate, he has also done some sports commentary for ESPN-TV 
and was a color commentator for ACC basketball games last season. 
</P>
<P>
But all his traveling and career dabbling convinced the 25-year-old Bilas his 
heart was still in Durham, N.C. So when Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski offered him 
an assistant coaching spot while he attends law school, Bilas jumped at it. 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks he'll be back at Duke, working Krzyzewski's summer camps and 
preparing to return to school. He found the desire for a law degree and the 
lure of Duke enough to hang up the hightops, for now. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably could have had a nice 10-year career in Europe, but I was concerned 
I'd be 30 and not have the drive to go back to school," he said. "The coaching 
(position) is not something I would've asked for. I was pleased Coach K offered 
it. I was really flattered. I guess once school starts I'm not gonna have a 
minute to myself, but Coach K understands I'll be a full-time student and spend 
as much time as I can with the team. He's always been very supportive of 
academics." 
</P>
<P>
It's clear Bilas has a special fondness for Duke and Krzyzewski, who recruited 
the all-CIF, 6-foot-8 forward out of Rolling Hills in 1982. Bilas became a role 
player at Duke, averaging 8.4 points and 5.4 rebounds in a four-year career. He 
finished with 1,062 career points with best games of 23 points and 13 rebounds 
-- a solid career but not imposing. But as part of an outstanding group that 
included Mark Alarie, Johnny Dawkins and Tommy Amaker, Bilas started 106 
collegiate games and helped vault the Blue Devils into the basketball elite. 
Bilas' last collegiate appearance was in the 1986 NCAA championship game, where 
Duke was beaten by Louisville, 72-69. 
</P>
<P>
"College was fun. I had a great time at Duke," Bilas said. "My first year we 
started four freshmen and we kind of got beat up. But we turned it around. My 
senior year we were (ranked) No. 1 the whole year. That's something we'll keep 
with us our whole life. The guys there now don't have the same perspective we 
had. We experienced both ends of the spectrum. When I talk to Dawkins and 
Alarie we still talk about it. Now you see Duke T-shirts everywhere. It wasn't 
always like that. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd gone to Iowa or Syracuse I might've been a better individual player. I 
think I could've scored a lot more points somewhere else. But I don't think I 
would've gotten the all-around experience." 
</P>
<P>
Bilas was drafted, and cut, by the Dallas Mavericks, who still hold his NBA 
rights. He landed in Italy and found European ball a refreshing experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I was gonna get off the plane shooting," he said. "I averaged about 
21 points and 10 rebounds. It was fun for me to start scoring again, to get to 
shoot from the outside. It was a renewing-type experience. I loved it." 
</P>
<P>
Things turned sour this season after he signed with a team in Spain. Bilas said 
it was written into his contract that he could miss one day of practice to take 
the LSAT in Madrid, the only day of the year it was being given. But when that 
day approached, the team owners tried to stop him from going to Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there and back in one day. I missed one practice. They fined me $2,000," 
Bilas said. "It got kind of ugly. I said (if they fined me) I wouldn't play 
anymore. They bought out my contract. They asked me when I wanted to leave. I 
said as soon as possible. They handed me a plane ticket for the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real early flight. In fact, a team official drove me to the airport. 
In the terminal there was this guy reading the paper and he kept looking at the 
paper, then looking at me, and it wasn't the normal this-guy-is-huge stare. 
When I picked up a paper the headline was 'Bilas Abandons Team.' They said I 
left in the middle of the night and they didn't even know where I was. They 
made me the bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
Bilas got several offers from other overseas teams -- the Yugoslavs would have 
let him play as a national because of his family origin -- but Bilas had had 
enough basketball for a while. When his agent, Larry Fleischer, died, it was 
time to look elsewhere. When the commercial offers came along he was ready to 
go Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister (Shari) did a little modeling. She and my mom said I should try 
some. I just laughed, like yeah, right. Then I got a call to try out for the 
Minolta commercial. It was the kind of thing where if I had the time, I'd show 
up. I went to a casting call, then got a callback. There were 20 or 30 guys in 
a gym in Hollywood. Then I got another callback. They said I had the part." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial was filmed at picturesque Point Fermin in San Pedro. A child 
actor-basketball player was flown in from New York. In the ad, he plays 
one-on-one against Bilas, then dunks over him. "We spent a day at wardrobe in 
Hollywood, then filmed for a day. It's amazing how many people it takes to do 
one commercial," Bilas said. "It was a neat deal. The little kid had done other 
commercials; he was a pro. He'd say, 'Now this is gonna happen, now that's 
gonna happen.' The director yelled a lot. I was gonna tell him, 'I've been 
yelled at by tougher guys than you. I've been yelled at by Coach K and Bobby 
Knight.' I'm used to getting yelled at." 
</P>
<P>
In the course of filming, someone on the set suggested Bilas get an agent. He 
did, and quickly got a tryout for the Budweiser commercial. He showed up at a 
gym with a lot of other ballplayers. "It was almost like a tryout for a 
basketball team. I saw a lot of guys I played ball against in high school. I 
got the commercial, and we filmed it in a day." Bilas' big moment comes at the 
end, where he wearily sits after a game and clasps hands with another player. 
Bigger things were to come. 
</P>
<P>
"My agent called and said, 'Go read for this part.' He didn't think I was gonna 
get it. It was really strange: You go in this room and stand before these guys 
and read. I was really nervous. I read a couple pages. They kept saying, 'Very 
nice.' I got a call (later) that day and went back and read again. They signed 
me right there. It was really exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Bilas discovered he had a full-fledged role as an extraterrestrial. The film, 
featuring the hunky Lundgren and a series of pyrotechnic effects, was shot in 
the Houston area from February through May. To play his character, Bilas had 
the front part of his head shaved and a braided ponytail added in back. His 
hair is just now growing back to a crew cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I get used to being stared at, but this was different," he said. "When I was 
going around Houston a lot of people thought I was sick. People thought I was a 
patient. I had to explain it three or four times a day." 
</P>
<P>
But he had fun filming. "We blew up about half of downtown Houston," he noted.

DAVE DISTEL: SOCKERS HAVE NEW FACES, NEW SCENARIO, SAME RESULTS

<P>
Those teases. That had to be what the Sockers had been doing. Teasing. 
</P>
<P>
They had their fans in a funk and the Baltimore Blast fans on fire. They had 
been playing so poorly, looking so flat, looking so lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
And all of this at the worst of times, all of this needing only one more win to 
take their seventh indoor soccer championship. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Sockers really have a chance to win Game 7 of the Major Indoor Soccer 
League's championship series Saturday night in Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
Are you kidding? 
</P>
<P>
No one who watched them lose Tuesday night at home and then suffer that 7-0 
embarrassment Thursday night here would have given them a ghost of a chance. 
Mr. Ed would win the Belmont before these guys would win Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out the Sockers had been kidding. They had to be. 
</P>
<P>
What happened Saturday night was that the Blast got hit by a giant dose of 
reality. The Blast got hit by the real San Diego Sockers. The Blast scared the 
Sockers out of their wits, but came up short in what was probably the most 
electric game the Sockers have ever played. 
</P>
<P>
The final score was 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby, Blast. 
</P>
<P>
Hello, seventh Socker championship. 
</P>
<P>
And No. 7 was heaven, because it had seemed so unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"We win at home and we win on the road," said Kevin Crow, a veteran defender at 
all of 27. "We win coming back and we win sweeping." 
</P>
<P>
And that they won this one at all was . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," said Waad Hirmez, whose fourth-period goal was the game-winner. 
"It's amazing how we did it." 
</P>
<P>
And, for the Blast, it all seemed to happen so swiftly. The score was 1-1 late 
in the first half and 11,220 fans were waiting anxiously for the hometown 
heroes to break it open and kick the celebration into gear. 
</P>
<P>
Then it happened. 
</P>
<P>
Blast goalkeeper Scott Manning's hand ball outside the box gave the Sockers a 
penalty kick, and Branko Segota scored with 3:13 left to break the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the second half, the Sockers went from tiebreakers to heartbreakers. 
First Segota scored and then Brian Quinn and then Steve Zungul, all in the 
first 2:33 of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Sockers, left for dead Thursday night, were up, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to stay tight in the first half," said Hirmez, "and then come out 
fired up and win the first seven minutes of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers won those first seven minutes in the biggest of ways, playing 
vintage Socker soccer. They blocked and counter-punched and threw attackers in 
waves at the out-manned Manning. 
</P>
<P>
When Hirmez banged a goal home 33 seconds into the fourth quarter, it had the 
makings of a rout. Little could anyone image that this insurance policy would 
ever be cashed in. 
</P>
<P>
When Blast Coach Kenny Cooper installed David Byrne as a sixth attacker with 
12:50 to play, it smacked of desperation . . . albeit very understandable 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, no one imagined the score would be 6-5 with the longest 4 minutes 28 
seconds the Sockers have ever experienced ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
Goal keeper Victor Manuel Cabral DeBarros Nogueira, perhaps the only man in 
professional sports with all five vowels in his last name, had the hottest seat 
in the house for that frantic, frenzied final 4:28. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting pretty scared," said Nogueira. "They were scoring like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Not quite crazy enough. The Sockers held on and V.M.C.D.N. added three more 
initials -- MVP. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kinda weird," said Nogueira, an indoor veteran but a champion for the 
first time. "The San Diego Sockers are always champions. There are different 
players every year, and I'm just another different player." 
</P>
<P>
New faces abounded in the champagne-soaked locker room. Paul Wright, the 
20-year-old kid from Grossmont High School, was the smiling face who had the 
winning assist. Chris Chueden was new. Ralph Black was new. Cacho was new. Alan 
Willey was new. None of them had won championships before, because none had 
been Sockers before. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wrote us off at the beginning of the season," said Crow. "We lost a 
lot of players for financial reasons and some people weren't sure we kept the 
right players. This team can win with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
One constant, of course, is that Ron Newman is the coach. He has been part of 
each of these celebrations, and a very big reason why they keep happening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle," he said, "continuing to win like we have." 
</P>
<P>
This one may have been the biggest miracle at all. This team was dead and all 
but buried. No one believed in them but themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But then, who else could have known that they were just being teases . . . 
right to the end.

<P>
Craig Anderson's clubs may have been a little dusty, but his golf game sure 
looked polished. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, whose clubs didn't get much use after he quit professional golf 
because of a chronic bad back seven years ago, shot a one-under-par 71 at the 
Balboa Park Golf Course Saturday to take a two-shot lead after 54 holes of the 
San Diego Men's Amateur Championships. Pat Duncan, who has won three of the 
last five championships, and Steve Haase are tied at 215 after shooting 71s on 
the 6,058-yard, par-72 course. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament moves back to Torrey Pines for the final round today with a 7 
a.m. shotgun start on the South course. Of the three courses on which the 
tournament has been played -- Torrey Pines North and South courses and Balboa 
Park -- the South course is considered the most difficult at more than 7,000 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really frustrating, I couldn't swing the club right," said Anderson, 
who recently regained his amateur status. "I hadn't played for four or five 
years. Now I've just started getting interested again. The clubs were in the 
garage gathering dust." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was the No. 2 golfer at USC behind Scott Simpson and finished second 
to Poway's Lennie Clements in the Southern California High School Championships 
while at Pacific Palisades in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
After USC, Anderson went on to play nearly three years on the mini, Asian and 
South American tours. But inflamed arthritis in his lower back forced him to 
quit the sport in 1982. Anderson, now a general contractor, then joined the 
family business and put the clubs in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"My back's fine if I don't practice," Anderson, 31, said. "Golf isn't too good 
for your back. Every golfer has a bad back." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson started playing again in November and said he has come to grips with 
the limitations brought on by his back. And although his pro career is long 
over, Anderson does miss some of the aspects of touring. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of traveling to tournaments in Argentina, Venezuela and Chile he now 
settles for Santa Ana, San Diego and Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"All my buddies are out there (on the pro tour)," said Anderson. "I'm happy 
with my life now. It's different. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I have a good attitude (about golf) and that helps. I don't expect a lot 
out of me." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson had never played the Balboa Park course until he managed to get in a 
practice round earlier last week. That experience was not nearly as enjoyable 
as Saturday's round on the course turned out to be. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was with a group on the fifth hole when he heard "fore" and ducked. 
Just as he did, a ball from another tee hit a 65-year-old man from his group in 
the head. The man was taken away in an ambulance. He was OK, but Anderson was a 
little unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried about (getting hit) the rest of the round," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't too worried Saturday, as he had three birdies and two bogies to keep 
the two-stroke lead he had over four other golfers after the second round. 
Robert Dickinson was tied with Anderson after 36 holes but shot a 75 at Balboa 
to drop four shots behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Now the tournament is back at Torrey Pines South for the finale. "I think I'll 
have to shoot under par tomorrow to win," Anderson said. "You have to think of 
Duncan, he's won it three of the last five years." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan is trying to become the first player to win three consecutive 
championships since Johnny Thompson (1947-49). Duncan, a landscape contractor 
from Rancho Santa Fe, also won the tournament in 1984 and finished third in 
1985.

THE HUNGER FOR MORE SEARCHING FOR VALUES IN AN AGE OF GREED BY LAURENCE SHAMES 
(TIMES BOOKS: $18.95; 284 PP.; 0-8129-1656-5) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Frank Levering, Levering and Wanda Urbanska, who live in Orchard Gap, Va., 
are writing a book for Viking on simplifying one's life. Urbanska is the author 
of The Singular Generation: Young Americans in the 1980s (Doubleday). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the summer of 1979, Jimmy Carter, in the manner of the Hebrew prophets he 
admires, descended from two weeks of seclusion at Camp David and declared to a 
less-than-enthralled nation: "Human identity is no longer defined by what one 
does but by what one owns." Yet, Carter warned, "Owning things and consuming 
things do not satisfy our longing for meaning. We have learned that piling up 
material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Shames, in his second book, "The Hunger for More: Searching for Values 
in an Age of Greed" alludes neither to that speech nor to the merciless 
prophet-stoning that followed. Nor does he quote George Bush, who -- with no 
apparent irony -- eerily echoed his former adversary: " . . . My friends, we 
are not the sum of our possessions." 
</P>
<P>
But Shames, once the ethics columnist for Esquire, is preaching precisely the 
same message against Mammon as Carter and (dare we believe it?) Bush, targeting 
that inglorious decade bracketed by the two speeches as an "age of greed." A 
feisty Baby Boomer (who notes that he grew up in a 1960s suburb), Shames is 
artfully re-packaging one of the grand old messages in American culture, from 
Jefferson to Thoreau, from Veblen to Schumacher -- a message, in his words, of 
"the high and difficult ideal of a balanced life -- a life that integrates 
labor and leisure, one that reconciles self-interest with an ethic of service, 
one that recognizes peace of mind not only as a desirable thing but as a moral 
achievement in itself." 
</P>
<P>
For Shames, who joins a host of decade-watchers now looking back in anger, the 
'80s, in fact, self-destructed on Meltdown Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. With the 
stock-market crash, he insists, came a dark night of the national soul, then 
the advent of a new era in which entrenched assumptions about money, success 
and what he calls "the habit of more" no longer went unchallenged. Never mind 
that Shames has, as yet, an empty bag of evidence for this happy turn of 
events; in his admitted optimism, he wants to believe it -- and so, of course, 
will some readers. 
</P>
<P>
How, after all, short of war, Depression or full-scale environmental disaster, 
could the lights get dimmer for many Americans than they did in the '80s? In 
bracing prose, Shames dissects a litany of the decade's maladies: the 
society-wide worship of a money-based definition of success; the increasingly 
inequitable distribution of wealth; the erosion of the middle class; the sharp 
decline of American productivity and economic clout. It was a time of permanent 
limits, he argues, of a closed frontier on national growth, "but Americans have 
been somewhat backward in adopting values, hopes, ambitions that have to do 
with things other than more. In America, a sense of quality has lagged far 
behind a sense of scale." Or, as he puts it in one of the many aphorisms that 
pepper his chapters: "Measuring more is easy; measuring better is hard." 
</P>
<P>
Pithy and bolstered with an impressive array of facts and figures, Shames' 
analysis of what went wrong in the '80s is, nevertheless, by now, mostly 
warmed-over porridge: That Americans in the '80s denied the death of what 
economist Kenneth Boulding once called the prosperous, postwar "cowboy economy" 
is not exactly revelatory, nor are the psychological reasons he cites for why 
we shamelessly lionized the values of CEOs, consumed beyond our means, and 
obsessed on wealth in a time of identity crisis for both the middle class and 
the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
Shames is more engaging when he gives rein to the sort of ethical 
preoccupations that marked his column for Esquire. In "Ghettos of the 
Conscience," a wide-lensed retrospective of business ethics in the '80s, Shames 
argues forcibly that "people found it much less exposing to compartmentalize 
morality, to regard business as a sort of ghetto of the conscience, a bad 
neighborhood for values, but one that could be avoided in the evenings and on 
weekends." This "ghetto view of conscience," he concludes, "creates an 
atmosphere in which the bad guys can prosper. Denatured values, having lost 
their ability to balance money against other things that matter, allow this to 
pass for 'winning.' " 
</P>
<P>
True enough, but has the atmosphere really changed? It would certainly be 
lovely to think so. But no one really knows -- only Shames, for whom saying is 
believing. "By the spring of 1988," he writes, "eighties social fashions had 
begun to look as bad as last year's suit. The rabid chase after the fast and 
famous dollar had already come to seem a trifle retro, a little out of sync." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. Maybe not. One reason he's not convincing is that -- as he does in 
virtually all his arguments -- Shames either relies on his own instincts, rafts 
of statistics or books, magazines and other media. What about Americans in 
every nook and cranny of the country whose values he thinks are changing? 
Shames doesn't leave New York to enter their lives, to talk over the thorny 
issues of revising their aspirations, so we don't meet them firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
The two people we do get to know, whose story of shifting values threads 
through the book, are a mid-to-late-'30s West Side couple making a combined 
annual salary of $460,000 in 1987. "They are not typical Americans," he tells 
us. Right, guy. So what do they portend for the rest of us? Compelling as it is 
in many respects, at the heart of this book is an insular view of what's going 
on outside Manhattan. It is that strange phenomenon of Shames' era -- and ours 
-- of media-fed wisdom, of media feeding on itself. 
</P>
<P>
No prophet, it seems, must go unstoned. Still, for what he lacks in method, 
Shames more than makes up for as provocateur. This is a spirited, often 
trenchant book by a disciplined essayist heralding what may be one of the most 
dramatic stories of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"Success, to an extraordinary degree, was the constant target of will and 
exertion in the 1980s, the glittering but indistinct Oz toward which 
aspirations strained. What, precisely, did the word mean? No one seemed to 
know, but it didn't really matter. Success didn't need to be defined or 
examined; it was enough merely to invoke it, to intone the magic word. Success 
was invoked more often and with far greater assurance than was self-fulfillment 
in the seventies, it was pursued by far greater numbers and with far greater 
heat than were peace and love in the sixties. Those other credos, after all, 
set themselves up, if not in opposition to, then certainly in tension with, 
conventional self-interest: Some part of their vigor was squandered on 
resolving that tension, on trying to wrestle that tension to the mat while 
keeping one's values intact. 
</P>
<P>
"The credo of success, eighties-style, on the other hand, was the credo of 
self-interest. It was old-fashioned economic Darwinism dressed up in new 
clothes. Success eighties-style was survival-of-the-fiscally-fittest padding 
the jungle in running shoes. It was primal aggressiveness slaking itself not on 
blood but on cold-pressed virgin olive oil. It was the unchastened acquisitive 
impulse, the primal appetite for more, legitimized by social fashion and 
summarized in the deceptively mild war whoop, go for it. 
</P>
<P>
"But in fact there was nothing at all mild about the eighties quest for 
success. That quest, rather, was feverish and a little hysterical, carried out 
in a kind of trance. The thing was to get there. Getting there was in the 
nature of a personal dare, and once you'd accepted it, you neither rested nor 
asked questions."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: LESSONS IN LAUGHTER THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A DEAF ACTOR BY 
BERNARD BRAGG AS SIGNED TO EUGENE BERGMAN (GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY PRESS: $17.95; 
340 PP.)

Sign language is deaf actor Bernard Bragg's art form. In his autobiography he 
eloquently argues that deaf culture exits separate from the attempts of the 
deaf to function as "normal" hearing people. The child of deaf parents (his 
father was an amateur actor), Bragg recalls his shock when he discovered that 
he differed from the hearing. Upon entering the New York School for the Deaf, 
he further discovered that not all his classmates were equally versed in sign 
language. Some spoke expressively, using gestural vocabulary new to Bragg, 
while others could only communicate with crude finger-spelling. 
</P>
<P>
Language and the discussion of language in "Lessons in Laughter" are its most 
interesting feature. There is a great discrepancy between the vividness of 
Bragg's stories, which he signed, and the woodenness of the printed 
translation; it is a tribute to his superb storytelling that the reader can 
almost see the actor. The most memorable images from the stories demonstrate 
how complex, nuanced and passionate communication is conducted without spoken 
words. Bragg recalls the deaf people he has met whose signing increased his 
appreciation for the richness of the deaf language. And in a scene that takes 
place in the shower room of the New York School for the Deaf, a classmate 
threatens Bragg's life with aggressive gestures: "I rubbed my eyes. The message 
he had signed to me looked all wrong. Had he really signed that he was going to 
kill me? I had never seen such a savage snarl on him. I asked him to repeat. 
Chopping the air violently with his hands, he signed, 'You saw me all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
The title refers not only to Bragg's coming to terms with his own art and the 
hearing world, but also to the dreadful classroom experience, which in Bragg's 
memory represents the hearing world's awful imposition of hearing values on 
deaf children. A hearing teacher who apparently loathed the unfettered sounds 
of his deaf pupils decided one day that his students must learn to laugh in a 
seemly fashion. He made them hold their sides and perform exhalation exercises, 
correcting them when they did not emit the proper sounds.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: DAVE BARRY SLEPT HERE A SORT OF HISTORY OF THE UNITED

Columnist Dave Barry turns his formidable wit to the subject of American 
history, with a result reminiscent of the Reduced Shakespeare Company: The 
better you know the original, the funnier it gets. 
</P>
<P>
Barry spoofs the dry-as-dust textbook style with such devices as "reconstructed 
conversations," dates galore (for simplicity's sake, however, all dates are 
given as October 8), absurd footnotes (the note for one quoted expert reads: "A 
friend of ours. You don't know him.") and ridiculous discussion questions 
("Whatever happened to the Hessians anyway? You never see them around.") The 
narrative is interrupted by an "Educational Advisory Alert" from the academic 
powers that be, warning that unless women and minorities are represented, "this 
book will not be approved for purchase by public school systems in absolutely 
vast quantities." The text subsequently provides the typically obsequious but 
utterly irrelevant asides on the contributions of minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
Imaginative though his skewed historical facts are, Barry's best moments depend 
on his lampoons of today's gripes, conceits, silly euphemisms and fashions. 
"Just when the Jamestown colonists were about to give up," he writes, "they 
came up with a promising new product concept: tobacco." The colonists' taxation 
problems turn on the complexity of the tax forms; the temporary British 
solution is to offer toll-free passage to England to consult with Tax 
Assistors. As the revolution approaches, the rebels are naturally referred to 
as "freedom-loving colonists."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: MEN AND WOMEN DRESSING THE PART EDITED BY CLAUDIA BRUSH

"Men and Women: Dressing the Part" is too stiff and dressy a title for a book 
that might better have sported a more casual label. The argument the book hopes 
to make is that clothing expresses the subordination of women; because male 
symbols are more highly valued, any moves toward sexual equality in this area 
have entailed women's adoption of men's clothing. "If and when equality comes," 
the text states, "both men and women will be free to express their unique 
individuality drawing from the broad vocabulary of masculinity and femininity." 
This conclusion has no firmer support than avant-garde designer Rudi 
Gernreich's 1970 vision of men and women wearing miniskirts and trousers 
interchangeably -- although the authors take a dim view of his sexually 
differentiated sketches. A serious discussion of gender identity and sexual 
inequality demands sterner stuff. 
</P>
<P>
There is no need to impose on this wealth of subject matter any single, 
restrictive theory of the functions of clothing. The articles -- written by 
several contributors -- suggest a wide variety of links between gender 
identity, cultural values, social interactions and dress. The discussions 
provide much of substance, from the impact of mass production on clothing 
design and policemen's early resistance to wearing uniforms to the evolution of 
sportswear from the mid-19th Century to the present. One chapter asks why 
today's infant clothing is more sex-typed than in the past. Prior to World War 
II, boys' first haircuts and first trousers were described as traumatic for the 
mother. Tracing the changes in toddler dress, the article concludes that 
parents since World War I have become increasingly preoccupied with teaching 
their young children "sex roles," ostensibly for their psychological health.

DISMISSING IMPERIALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Parenti's "The Sword and the Dollar: Imperialism, Revolution and the 
Arms Race" succinctly reveals the sordid history of Western Imperialism that, 
to this date, victimizes the world's peoples, particularly in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
One would never know this, though, from reading Kevin Phillips' "review" (Book 
Review, May 21). Instead of critically examining the thesis of the book, he 
simply dismisses it and redbaits the author by stating that the sources cited 
at the end of each chapter refer only to "New York's Monthly Review Press, 
International Publishers, Progress Publishers of Moscow and the like." But even 
in this statement Phillips misrepresents the book, for each chapter contains 
dozens of citations from sources as diverse as the New York Times, Business 
Week and George F. Kennan. Parenti's book sheds light on the real causes of the 
miseries of the world's peoples. Yet Phillips does not challenge even a single 
statement of historical fact; he says nothing about the book but reveals 
everything about himself and where he stands.

If ever there was a biased, distorted and self-serving review of a book it is 
Phillips' arrogant dismissal of Parenti's "The Sword and the Dollar." To 
paraphrase Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: "The mind of a Conservative is like 
the pupil of the eye. The more light shed, the greater the contraction." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is offended by Parenti's preoccupation with United States policies and 
failure to condemn those of the Soviet Union. I don't believe that was 
Parenti's objective. He probably thought that the condemnation of the Soviets 
was left in better hands, i.e., those of Pat Buchanan, George Will, Henry 
Kissinger, et al. I am certain that Phillips does not consider these writers 
biased when they excoriate the policies of the Soviets while exculpating us, 
the good guys. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips also takes a sideswipe at Parenti's Ph.D. One wonders why. To 
Phillips, the book is terra incognita. The only thing Phillips did not accuse 
Parenti of was Willie Horton's furlough.

Times reviewer Orville Schell noted the difficulty of biography in a country of 
closed archives. The documentary shortcomings of Franz's work are thus real, he 
concluded, and yet: "(The biography) is not likely to be improved upon soon, 
unless Deng himself suddenly steps out of that long tradition of secretive 
leaders and unburdens himself to the world for posterity or until that 
unforeseeable time in the future when the archives in Beijing are finally 
opened." Jack Miles

<P>
All those who think boozy, manic-depressive Irishmen possess an ineffable charm 
may remain seated. Those feeling otherwise may if they choose leave the room. 
Now we can begin our meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Our bibulous Celt in this case is Seamus Boyne, a roistering artist of 
acknowledged talent, whose consuming ambition is to have a painting hung in 
London's Tate Gallery, alongside those of his idol Joseph Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Boyne is abetted, in a climactic effort toward this goal, by a pal from their 
salad days in Paris a dozen years before -- anomalously, an "Ivy League Jew" 
from Long Island named Gene Hagar, whose literary ambitions have been stifled 
by enforced management of his family's dreary exterminating business. 
</P>
<P>
In a mid-life crisis, Boyne inveigles Hagar into flying to London to give him 
moral support on the eve of a triumphal exhibition of his paintings calculated 
to clinch the Tate enshrinement. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Plausibility City. But suddenly Boyne's manic propensities take over, 
and we are whirled through a series of escapades that are a distillation of the 
Keystone Kops, the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges. A drunken voyage on the 
Thames in Boyne's leaking cabin cruiser (the artist's substitute for a 
cross-town taxi ride) . . . a riotous art show culminating in arson . . . an 
alcoholic midnight assignation on the storm-tossed boat between Boyne and an 
old flame from Paris . . . a foray in which Boyne, disguised as a rich Arab, 
manages to shoplift a canoe from Harrod's and maneuver it onto the upper deck 
of a No. 30 bus. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this farrago, poor Hagar is largely a bemused onlooker, 
intermittently pressing matrimonial yearnings for Ciara, a conveniently 
transplanted dream girl from the two men's Paris days. 
</P>
<P>
This spate of slapstick might be insupportable if it were not for the 
narration. Dick Wimmer, who has written short stories and worked on TV films, 
encases the zany saga in an enchanted aura by couching it entirely in the 
stream-of-consciousness prose hallowed by James Joyce and disciples. 
</P>
<P>
". . . And now for this pink, sweet-smelling soap, circular motions around the 
wool of my prime, across my middle and down my thighs -- could use a little 
meat on those wasted bones . . . GOOD GOD, and there's no way out . . . Just a 
deep breath as I appear, grinning in my birthday suit, before their dumbfounded 
stares . . . O Mother of Christ, forgot my beret! . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Joycean "Inner monologue," although abused by amateurs, has its uses. As a 
sort of spastic shorthand, it offers infinite elasticity for mixing actions, 
thoughts, emotions, flashbacks and sidelights. 
</P>
<P>
Wimmer takes full advantage of the offbeat mode to convey with a certain 
fascination a yarn that in conventional prose would hardly work. His 
artfulness, like a magician's smoke, temporarily obscures the fact that his 
protagonist is rather an obnoxious boor and that he has pushed farce far beyond 
textbook limits.

HEARING 'THE CALL OF THE WILD'

By KEITH LOVE, Love is a Times staff writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine that you were one of the lucky ones invited to a house in the Oakland 
foothills on a bracing evening in 1903. The house, which rented for $35 a 
month, was set amid fruit trees, tall pines and poppies and looked on San 
Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular evening, Jack London gave his friends their first exposure 
to what was to be his masterpiece: "The Call of the Wild." 
</P>
<P>
He read it out loud himself. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the unabridged recordings of this classic have persuaded me that even 
more than reading "The Call of the Wild," listening to it transports you to 
that time described in the very first paragraph, in which Buck the dog is about 
to lose forever his sunny life in Santa Clara: 
</P>
<P>
"Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was 
brewing. . . . Men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, 
and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, 
thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As Buck's story unfolds, you almost hear the hiss of the sled runners, 
virtually feel the "white silence" as it envelopes man and beast. You wince as 
Buck gets his "education" from the unforgettable man in the red sweater. 
</P>
<P>
And near the end, there is this foreboding passage as Buck and the dog sled 
team pull their masters toward a gold strike: 
</P>
<P>
"In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, 
where wild fowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of life -- 
only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered places, and 
the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches." 
</P>
<P>
London expert Russ Kingman of Glen Ellen, Calif., says the author wrote "The 
Call of the Wild" in two months, scratching out its 32,000 words with an 
ink-pencil "on whatever paper he could find." 
</P>
<P>
The story was written nearly five years after London spent the winter of 
1897-98 in and around Dawson during the Klondike gold rush. At the time of his 
trek, London was a virtual ne'er-do-well who had only the vaguest idea that he 
wanted to be a writer. He found little of the yellow metal during his months in 
the Klondike, but he saw the men and dogs -- and heard the tales -- that were 
to show up in his writing. 
</P>
<P>
After the reading that night in 1903, London shipped his manuscript off to the 
Saturday Evening Post. Did he realize what he had? Maybe not. His asking price 
was $700 and he included a stamped return-envelope. The magazine accepted the 
piece, but told him to cut 5,000 words, according to Kingman. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the Macmillan Co. offered to publish "The Call of the Wild" as a book and 
urged London to make an unusual deal: He would be paid $2,000 outright and 
would receive no future royalties from this book. In return, Macmillan promised 
to produce an attractive edition and promote it heavily. London agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the book became a steady best seller, London scholar James 
Lundquist and others say the author never regretted the deal because the 
success and distribution of "The Call of the Wild" guaranteed him top prices 
for his work ever after. 
</P>
<P>
This tale is a pure note, a masterful piece of storytelling that addresses such 
enduring themes as the survival of the fittest, the organizational principle of 
hierarchy and the idea of racial memory. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least five unabridged versions of "The Call of the Wild" in the 
cassette market. The listening time is four hours. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the best reading I sampled was Frank Muller's for Recorded Books. The 
pronunciations and inflections are virtually flawless in the Muller style. And 
when Buck's story is told, Muller's somber "the end" is a wonderful touch. The 
monthly rental fee is $9.50 plus postage. Telephone 800-638-1304; Master Card 
and VISA accepted. 
</P>
<P>
I also recommend another, more quirky, reading of "The Call of the Wild," this 
one by Jim Roberts for Jimcin Recordings and distributed by Books on Tape. The 
rental is $15.50 a month plus postage, and for the higher price you also get 
three hours of London short stories read by Walter Zimmerman. Telephone 
800-626-3333; VISA and Master Card. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts takes some getting used to because of his thick New England accent. But 
I found that of all the readings I sampled, his had the most energy and best 
conveyed the sense of urgency that distinguishes "The Call of the Wild." I 
think teen-age listeners will especially find it compelling.

<P>
Disparate essays, written for various publications under differing 
circumstances, when flung together tend to vary wildly in quality. Certainly 
that's the case with this book. In his concluding section, sardonically named 
"Living Off the Fat of the Land," Page Stegner finds a raffish picaresque tone, 
immensely likable and jaunty, reminiscent of Steinbeck in "Cannery Row." He 
recounts in hilarious, self-effacing detail his attempts -- with the help and 
hindrance of some friends -- first, to buy and raise a cow for inexpensive 
beef; next, to hunt "wild boar," which turn out to be a neighbor's domestic 
pigs; and finally, to buy and operate a small fishing boat. Disasters all, but 
Stegner has fun with his own foibles and you won't find a polemical sentence 
anywhere in the section. 
</P>
<P>
But polemics are what most of this book is about, and that's where things get 
problematic. Stegner wants to be another Edward Abbey. He wants to be the 
eloquent defender of American wilderness. He wants to be sarcastically funny 
about those who don't share his views. He wants to evoke the beauty and 
strangeness of the deserts and Badlands of the West. Abbey is irreplaceable, 
but Stegner doesn't get close, partly because he adopts a persona that rings 
false. 
</P>
<P>
His subtitle reveals his pose: a curmudgeon. It's a bad mistake. That persona 
is mostly unpleasant and unfair. Sometimes it's only a matter of inappropriate 
exaggeration: The alfalfa sprout is "another West Coast invention similar to 
atropine." Sometimes it's repellent: Bemoaning the undeniably despicable 
off-road vehicle abuse of the deserts, he offers a purportedly humorous wish to 
some bikers that when they reach the interstate they experience "a high-torque, 
full-throttle, speedwobble across the highway divider into the oncoming grill 
of an eighteen-wheeler." And in another essay, after viewing the grotesque 
spectacle of thousands of tourists at Grand Canyon Lodge on Memorial Day, 
Stegner writes: "We need a national program of euthanasia." 
</P>
<P>
I recall an old Ed Abbey piece called "The Winnebago Tribe," in which Abbey 
first recounted his essay scorn of the paleface hordes clogging up highways and 
campgrounds with their road monsters, but then "learned" from a sweet and salty 
old widow who'd carved out a meaningful nomad's life for herself traveling 
around North America in her Winnebago. Stegner's curmudgeon character would 
never meet that woman, never hear her story. 
</P>
<P>
Even his students, UC Santa Cruz environmental studies majors, get the 
treatment. A rafting trip down the San Juan River with a group of them reveals 
Stegner's contempt for their looks (one girl is "flat-headed and short-necked, 
shoulders like a nose tackle, no waist, no hips, no glutes. All stem from the 
armpits down"), their eating habits, their music, their ignorance, their 
bickering. 
</P>
<P>
Miners, and ranchers who graze cattle on public lands, become automatic 
faceless enemies in these essays -- greed incarnate, but not real people with 
real interests; Stegner never deems it important to hear their voices. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how morally pure, a writer must still make his case. He can't 
assume, as I believe Stegner often does, that saying something makes it so, 
that if he says X is good and Y is bad, the reader must automatically accept 
it. In 1980, on land near Grand Canyon National Park, an immensely rich uranium 
deposit was discovered. Stegner frets about the fate of that land. But he 
doesn't grapple with the issues posed. Do we ignore this uranium deposit? How 
much uranium do we need, and where else do we get it from? 
</P>
<P>
Like the National Review critic chagrined to find himself defending Lillian 
Hellman against the ad hominem attacks of right-wing historian Paul Johnson, I 
find myself sharing most of Stegner's views and biases but rebelling against 
the smug cocksureness of their expression. 
</P>
<P>
I think what I miss most in these essays on the American West -- and what Abbey 
always conveyed -- are a sense of joy (curmudgeons have a tough time with joy) 
and a consistent feel for the sensuous detail that can bring alive the harsh 
beauty of these untamed and unpeopled lands. Too often, instead, come dreary 
recitals of place names and routes: ". . . We drive south from the Owyhees, 
past the canyon of the Bruneau and through the Duck Valley Indian Reservation 
into the Independence Mountains where the headwaters of the Owyhee River now 
collect in a reservoir behind Wild Horse Dam." Elsewhere, describing a rafting 
trip on the Missouri River, Stegner refers suddenly to his "idiotic son" along 
on the trip but never tells us his age nor what he's like. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are lovely moments in these essays when Stegner does hit it 
just right. Traversing a desert, he says, ". . . if you hang around long enough 
for all that hammered, blasted, barren, awful, stifling strata to begin to look 
natural you begin to notice subtle distinctions. Color for instance." And then 
he makes perceptive and absolutely true observations of those colors and how 
they begin to appear to an adapting vision. 
</P>
<P>
Those moments, and the wonderful stories that round off the book, show Stegner 
at his best, and that best is very good indeed. If only there were more of it.

AMID INTIFADA, ONE PALESTINIAN ENTERPRISE OFFERS ECONOMIC HOPE

RAMALLAH, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a plain building near the center of this Palestinian Arab city, Susan 
Rockwell, Harvard '84, inspected the stitching on a high-fashion silk brassiere 
destined for sale in London's Harrods or New York's Bonwit Teller. 
</P>
<P>
"Top-of-the-line stuff," boasted her boss, Brooklyn-born Charles Shamas, Yale 
'69. 
</P>
<P>
But the undergarment was hanging on an iron rack a few feet from a window that 
had been pockmarked by an Israeli soldier's bullet during a recent clash on the 
stone-littered street below. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the turmoil of the intifada, as the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip is known, the two American advisers and 40 Arab employees of the 
not-for-profit Mattin Center for Product Development are making luxurious 
lingerie and a simple statement -- that with persistence and a tolerance for 
red ink, Palestinians can develop companies and management capable of competing 
in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
The aim, Shamas said, "is the business of creating human capital." 
</P>
<P>
Mattin has been at it for 10 years now, but the breakthrough came only as the 
intifada began to choke the economy of the occupied territories and of Israel 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unrest Stifles Trade 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Michael Bruno, governor of the Central Bank of Israel, 
reported that the violence and boycotts spawned by the 18-month-long uprising 
had cost Israel $650 million in export earnings last year, including an 
estimated $280 million from tourists frightened away by the rebellion. Bruno 
said he could not estimate the amount of foreign and domestic investment 
chilled by the climate of political uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
But Israel's exports to the occupied territories, a key indicator of the 
relationship, dropped 40%, Bruno disclosed in the bank's annual report. At the 
same time, imports from the territories plunged 48%. The Palestinian Arabs of 
the West Bank and Gaza make up Israel's second-largest foreign market, after 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Atef Kamal Alawnah, president of the Arab Economist Assn., explained in an 
interview in East Jerusalem that as part of the protest against Israeli 
administration in the territories, "we have tried to use our own goods." 
</P>
<P>
Although not entirely successful, Palestinians have created small dairy and 
tobacco industries, among others, to replace Israeli imports. 
</P>
<P>
Families in the West Bank are planting backyard gardens, making wool and doing 
piecework for small enterprises in an attempt to break their dependence on the 
Israeli economy. But Alawnah laments that most Palestinian-made goods are 
substandard. 
</P>
<P>
The Mattin brassieres, slips and negligees are sophisticated exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Process Over Product 
</P>
<P>
"The women here call these 'man-melters,' " Rockwell confided, holding up a 
pair of silky white pajama pants. She said Mattin's export products have been 
shown in ads in such fashion barometer publications as Vogue, Elle and Women's 
Wear Daily. 
</P>
<P>
Proud as they are of the frills turned out in the Ramallah factory, Shamas and 
Rockwell insist that it is the process, not the product, that is important to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Mattin's Palestinian staff wants to show the world what Palestinians can do, 
given the means and the freedom," Shamas said. 
</P>
<P>
Means and freedom have been a problem from the start, said the 40-year-old 
American, who professes to be a "naturalized Palestinian." 
</P>
<P>
His parents, both Lebanese, were in the garment business in New York, but when 
Shamas completed liberal arts studies at Yale at the height of the turbulent 
late 1960s, he was caught up in social issues, not in shirts and suits. 
</P>
<P>
He went to the Middle East to conduct economic research and found what he 
considered to be an almost completely negative set of circumstances in the 
Israeli-occupied territories: the brain drain of Palestinians leaving for 
better prospects abroad; a "dormitory economy" supported by Palestinians 
working in Israel and little business except for the small-scale trading 
enterprises typical of underdeveloped areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practical Experience Lacking 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, in his view, the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza had begun to 
see themselves as victims and had developed a handout mentality -- they had 
become willing to live on the charity of sympathizers abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian capital was available, however. What the Palestinians needed, he 
concluded, was some practical experience in running a modern business -- 
expertise in marketing, finance and accounting, production and quality control. 
Unfortunately, he had none of these. 
</P>
<P>
"People like me have these ideas, but very little background in business," 
Shamas conceded, but he recalled saying to himself: "This is going to be my 
thing. Let's get down to the business of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Shamas and some like-minded men founded Mattin to examine what business skills 
were needed, then formed the lingerie business in 1979 as a commercial 
laboratory -- he calls it a "learning-tolerant incubator venture" -- to test 
his ideas and to teach the Palestinian workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to learn it all from scratch right on the shop floor," he said. "We 
were bootstrappers." 
</P>
<P>
The first call went out to Brooklyn, to his widowed mother, who knew the trade, 
and for the family machines, old but still operable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Made in the West Bank' 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was getting them back together after the (Israeli) security 
check," Shamas recalled. "We had seven years of red ink, but we accepted it so 
long as what we produced against it was human capital." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of business, the obstacles were considerable. Mattin, for instance, 
had difficulty competing with Israeli firms because of added exchange rate 
costs for material imports, plus certain production subsidies for Israeli 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the labeling problem, resolved only in recent months. Israeli 
officials, Shamas said, wanted Mattin's export goods to go abroad labeled "Made 
in Israel," or "Made in Ramallah, Israel," masking their origin in the 
Palestinian-populated occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Under recent regulations worked out by the United States and European Community 
trade officials, Mattin products going to Europe are labeled "Made in the West 
Bank," and those going to the United States are tagged "Made in the 
Israeli-Occupied Territories" -- labels that give the Israelis no particular 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
The complexities of the political status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip also 
work against Palestinian businesses, Shamas insists. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel and Jordan have the GSP (Generalized System of Preferences, a U.S. 
trade privilege), but we don't," he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
But the underlying problem that Mattin and its advisers found when they took up 
their task has largely been solved. They have created business know-how, the 
human capital. 
</P>
<P>
"We have marketing people, production control experts, we have cutters and 
pattern-makers," Shamas said. 
</P>
<P>
The operations manager is a Palestinian woman, Selwa Duaibis. This small pool 
of middle-management personnel will be made available to other Palestinian 
businesses that want to follow the trail that Mattin has blazed through the 
Byzantine corridors of Israeli and international bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
The lingerie company will train newcomers to take their places, starting a 
spinoff of qualified commercial managers in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians want to be self-reliant," Shamas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Pressure on Israel 
</P>
<P>
Politically viable businesses in the territories help create the facts that 
underpin Palestinians' demand for an independent state. 
</P>
<P>
While business expertise is in the formative stage, the Palestinians intend to 
press Israel on other economic fronts, with Arab labor being their most 
forceful weapon. More than 100,000 Palestinians had been working in Israel, 
mostly as laborers. Sporadic strikes called by the intifada leadership have cut 
that number by about 25%, and Arab merchants in East Jerusalem close their 
shops every afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Alawnah, the Palestinian economist, pointed out that several sectors of the 
Israeli economy are particularly vulnerable to dependence on Palestinian 
workers. Of the 55,000 construction workers in Israel, for instance, only 5,000 
are Israelis, according to his figures. Palestinians also provide 40% of the 
hands in Israeli agriculture and do 70% of the seasonal harvesting, he said. 
This year's orange harvest in Israel was hurt by the labor boycott. 
</P>
<P>
But shop closings and labor boycotts hurt Arabs as well as Jews, and life in 
the territories has been difficult since the intifada began. West Bank schools 
have been closed under Israeli order. Workers who have abandoned their jobs in 
Israel cannot be absorbed by the small Palestinian economy. And the brain drain 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
For Palestinians, the achievements of Mattin lingerie stand out in a landscape 
of hard times.

SHOULD DEFENSE FIRMS SWITCH FROM SWORDS TO PLOWSHARES?; 
</P>
<P>
A MOVE INTO CIVILIAN MARKETS MIGHT SEEM WISE, BUT MANY DOUBT ITS PRACTICALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent announcements of major layoffs in Southern California by Hughes 
Aircraft and Northrop Corp. illustrate how hard the region can be hit by a 
slowdown in military spending. To protect communities against boom-and-bust 
economic cycles, peace activists, union leaders and others are urging military 
contractors to convert at least some of their production capacity to civilian 
use. But would that sort of changeover really be in the nation's best interest? 
And are the contractors capable of switching to non-military businesses? Times 
researcher Melanie Pickett interviewed various experts on economic conversion. 
Excerpts from their comments follow: 
</P>
<P>
 A. Ernest Fitzgerald, author of "The Pentagonists: An Insider's View of Waste, 
Mismanagement and Fraud in Defense Spending:" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what (else) these guys can do. . . . they've got to be hooked to 
the taxpayer's umbilical cord. They've had it so soft for so many years that 
it's like taking a bunch of aging jocks who've done nothing but sit around the 
bar at the country club and saying, 'Gosh, we're going to put you up against 
the L.A. Rams.' 
</P>
<P>
"We don't allow these giant firms to go bankrupt. . . . We have what amounts to 
survival of the least fit. I don't see any reason in the world that they'd want 
to voluntarily give up that easy life. Why would they? What other customer is 
going to adjust your prices, your specifications and schedule to approximate 
what you actually do? It's like shooting an arrow at a blank wall and then 
drawing a target around it." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour Melman, chairman of the National Commission for Economic Conversion and 
Disarmament and a Columbia University professor of industrial engineering: 
</P>
<P>
"As now constituted, there's very little that (military contractors) can move 
into. In fact, they are disabled from moving into just about anything. There's 
a record of aerospace factories attempting to make something civilian. The Rohr 
Co. tried to make the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) trains; Westinghouse 
Military Electronics tried to make the electronic control systems for BART; 
Grumman tried to make a city bus; Boeing tried to make a trolley car. Every one 
of these was a catastrophic failure. Failure in terms of the reliability of 
what was produced. And failure financially. . . . 
</P>
<P>
(To remedy that situation, Melman urged passage of the defense economic 
adjustment act, a bill proposed by U.S. Rep. Ted Weiss (D-New York) to require 
advance notice of major cutbacks at military plants.) "The cornerstone of (the 
legislation) is the provision that, as a condition of the contract with the 
Pentagon, military-serving factories, bases and laboratories above a given size 
-- more than 100 people -- have to establish an alternative-use committee, half 
named by the management, half named by the employees. The task of the 
alternative-use committee is to produce a complete technical economic plan for 
the use of people and facilities when the military work is done. In other 
words, Los Alamos would have to set up an alternative use committee and make 
proposals as to what the scientists, engineers and technologists in that place 
can be working on when the work for the Department of Defense is done. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this isn't going to see light of day on the floor of the Congress 
as long as the members of Congress are stuck with military Keynesianism, the 
attempt to bring jobs and income to their districts by the military dollar -- 
but that is obviously running out of steam. The senators from California aren't 
going to be able to do a damn thing about the Northrop and Hughes contracts. 
The pork-barreling is over . . . because we've run out of resources." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Berkow, executive director of California Unions for a Comprehensive 
Mutual Test Ban and Economic Conversion for Jobs, Peace and National Security: 
</P>
<P>
"The cutbacks are affecting the entire economy of the nation, primarily 
affecting places like Southern California, Virginia, Texas and even New York. . 
. . There's a domino effect to all this. It's not 6,000 workers here and 2,000 
there. The layoffs affect the entire economy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In the Soviet Union, they are taking the tanks that they've sent back and 
they're converting them into plows and other things to use in farming. . . . 
They've turned over 2,000 plants from the military to social needs. Now, they 
need that, because they've been tied up in this war economy, too. But we need 
it here, too. . . . (Contractors) can be producing pretty much anything -- they 
can produce machine parts, they can produce new machinery, they can produce 
material for bridges. The inner structure of our country is falling apart. 
Bridges are falling down, roads are caving in. There is much yet to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Beltramo, a defense industry consultant: 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it's an admirable objective, I don't know how realistic 
(conversion) is, given what's going on in China and maybe what's going on in 
Russia. I get real skeptical about these people that get the first outbreak of 
peace and everybody wants to scrap everything. As a lot of people point out, 
we're in a no-growth period, a retrenchment period, in defense, but there's 
still a whole lot of business out there. Even when you see the story on Hughes 
eliminating 6,000 positions, they talked about doing that by normal attrition. 
But there's absolutely going to be a downturn in defense business. No doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Marion Anderson, director of Employment Research Associates, consultants on the 
economic impact of government policies: 
</P>
<P>
"A basic concept of conversion and of conversion legislation is that these 
people have to be retrained. You do not necessarily have to retrain a factory 
worker who can make civilian electronics just as well as he or she can make 
military electronics, but if you have a salesman who has dealt only with 
generals and colonels, he might very well have to be retrained to deal with 
department stores. He or she is going to have to think differently and deal 
differently and, in fact, the whole product line has to be geared for something 
quite different. 
</P>
<P>
"In the civilian economy, you don't need to produce metals that can bear up 
under thousands of degrees of heat, because in most uses in the civilian 
economy you don't have thousands of degrees of heat. On the other hand, the 
product has to be durable, relatively easy to maintain and it has to be quick 
and easy to fix. It also has to be competitive in price. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There are tremendous capital and infrastructural needs within the United 
States, and I have no question but that a number of the military manufacturers 
could fill some of it. You have a lot of very talented people, and they could 
start working on civilian goods." 
</P>
<P>
California Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel), chairman of the Assembly Committee 
for Economic Development and New Technology: 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened historically in the aerospace industry when one company goes 
down is that another one goes up after getting a new contract. There hasn't 
been a real major dislocation, but in light of what you're seeing today, for 
the first time we may have permanent dislocations the likes of which we haven't 
experienced since 1976-1977. 
</P>
<P>
"From a state level, the information we've given, we've been able to warn these 
cities about how defense-dependent they've become. What we've not done a very 
good job of is on the conversion side of it. Now that you know you're going to 
be susceptible to impact, what can you do about it? The closures have been 
faster than we've been able to put all our ducks in order." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Skantze, retired Air Force general: 
</P>
<P>
"There's a vast majority of the American people who want to feel that the 
defense budget is reasonable and will maintain an adequate and strong defense. 
I don't think you'd have that same consensus to say 'well now, let's now spend 
that on solving pollution or homelessness. . . .' You will never get the 
breadth of a consensus for that sort of thing that you can for defense, because 
the average person who is a taxpayer, middle income, doing their thing, working 
hard, recognizes they need a (national) defense and will support that. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience has been, in the defense industry, there is some very bright, 
sharp people and, once challenged with the idea of being competitive outside 
the defense industry, I would feel very strongly they could do it."DR, Joe 
Crabtree / Los Angeles Times

NASD PLANS TO BEGIN PRE-DAWN TRADING

Wall Street stock traders will start opening shop much earlier in the day under 
a new plan announced Friday by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The NASD, a group of leading stockbrokers who operate the NASDAQ 
over-the-counter market, plans to start trading some over-the-counter shares at 
4 a.m. EDT, 5 1/2 hours earlier than the current opening. 
</P>
<P>
The move, due to begin in early 1990, is aimed at luring away some of the 
potentially lucrative trading done at that time on foreign exchanges, 
particularly the London stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The NASD plans to extend its trading hours on 200 to 300 over-the-counter 
stocks in early hours. 
</P>
<P>
The list would include actively traded over-the-counter shares such as Apple 
Computer Inc. and MCI Communications, as well as all 97 European shares listed 
on NASDAQ, which include Jaguar PLC and Cadbury Schweppes PLC. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason they are doing this is to compete with exchanges on a global 
basis. They want to take some of the business away from other foreign exchanges 
that happen to be trading at those hours, especially London," said OTC market 
analyst Jeffrey Adams of Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The NASD said 71 shares are listed currently on both the NASDAQ and the London 
stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this to respond to members' desires to have full NASDAQ services 
available to their London operations. Currently they have a limited amount of 
NASD services there and are not trading NASDAQ shares in any meaningful way 
until the U.S. market is open," NASD Chairman Joseph Hardiman said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington-based NASD services include items such as stock price information, 
computer links and surveillance for trading irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for pre-dawn trading has been approved by the NASD board, and Hardiman 
said it will file for Securities and Exchange Commission approval within 30 to 
60 days. 
</P>
<P>
The move requires approval by member firms who must foot the bill for expanded 
trading operations. Directors of over-the-counter trading desks of large New 
York firms that are NASD members said they were studying the proposal and 
trying to figure out the logistics of staffing their desks at those early 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"My idea right now is to just look at the whole idea, evaluate it and see if 
there is a need for it," said the director of one trading desk for a large New 
York-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I still find it hard to believe that a customer in Des Moines would call and 
want to buy 100 shares of MCI at four in the morning," he said. But he thought 
that European institutional accounts would most likely be interested in the 
extended trading hours. 
</P>
<P>
And already the trading chief said he would be heading to London next week to 
evaluate and make needed technical and staffing adjustments for the transition 
to earlier hours.

A GIRL'S TALE OF TYRANNY, FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following is one of the essays submitted by students to The Times 
Centennial Time Capsule Essay Contest. It was written by Tuyet Tran, a 
fifth-grader at Jackson School in Santa Ana. Tuyet has only had about three 
years of English instruction. Her essay appears unedited in its original form. 
</P>
<P>
Hi my name is Tuyet Tran, I'm Vietnamme girl. I'm 11 years old. Andrew Jackson 
is my school. I was in 5th grade. I have a nice family and they are very nice. 
I have two sisters and five brothers. All of us were born in Vietnam. All of my 
brothers are very strong and tall, but my sisters, are not. My parents love me, 
my sisters and My brothers very much. We try to make them happy. 
</P>
<P>
I remember when I was in Vietnam and I was little, my family and my aunt were 
poor, but all of my cousins were very rich. My parents let me live with my aunt 
because no one lived with her. In my country all of the people don't have 
freedom because my country was in war, and so we lost it. The people who took 
over my country are commists. A lot of Vietnamese people fled away from them 
and go to other country by boat when they have freedom and live there. 
</P>
<P>
My family plant rice and when it ripe, we have to gave rice to the communists 
and they gave us not very much rice and we don't have enough food to eat. My 
family can't stand any more so my family and my cousin made a plan to go. My 
aunt didn't want to go because she was born there and I have to leave her 
there. 
</P>
<P>
At night my family and my cousin went across the dangerous bridge but only me 
didn't want to cross the bridge and the bridge made me scare. The river under 
the bridge had glass and can, the tree had needles on it and some other things 
too. My parents told me to come over so I listened to them. At last I made it 
so we went into the forest and walked until we saw the river and my cousin came 
and we climbed on the boat he took us to the ship. 
</P>
<P>
On the ship I saw a lot of people, we climbed on the ship and rolled away. All 
the people on the ship saw some kind of big fish. On the way we don't have any 
trouble because God helped us. We were on the ship for two days and three 
nights. On the ship I couldn't eat food and I felt sick. Almost dark, we saw 
the Island and got on the land. All the people went out of the ship and we saw 
some natives. They were kind to us and gave us food and found us a house. 
</P>
<P>
One month Later they sent us to Island and so they took us to America. When I 
came to America, I saw so many cars and buildings and horeses. They look 
beautiful. I saw my sister and my brother because my parents let them go to 
America first. My sisters look prettier they when they were in Vietnam. I saw a 
lot of things I alway want. There were many factories. I saw clothes, shoes and 
it look pretty. 
</P>
<P>
I never saw America people before but now I do. America people look pretty. I 
saw some different kinds of people and they talk in Engish but I don't 
understand what they say. My sister told my family to get into the car and took 
us home. When I got home I saw that house was big. In Vietnam my neighbor had 
one T.V. and it's not good and it don't have many chanel. That day my sister 
had party to welcome us, I saw my cousin come to my house. Sometimes my sister 
took me to my aunt house to play. Now I have fun with my cousin like in 
Vietnam. I love my aunt and my friends very much because they are very nice to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
One month later my sister took me to school and then I meet two of my best 
friends named Linh and Thu Le. They were very nice to me. I meet them from 
second grade to fifth grade and we have fun together in all those years. We 
have nice teachers named Mrs. Sherrill, Ms. Sibial and Mrs. Mehrtens and they 
taught us a lot of things and are nice to us. We like them very much and thanks 
to them we can speak English. They are the best teachers we have ever had. My 
school is big and has many rooms. There are a lot of games at the playground. 
My school has a nice principal named Dr. Roelen. She likes the children very 
much and cares for them. She keep my school tidy. Sometimes, she told a joke to 
make the children laught. All the children like her because she is very nice. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite hobby is American music because I understand the voices of the 
songs. In America my family are not rich and not poor and we also have freedom. 
We always thank America to let us live here and we also thank God because he 
help my family get away from trouble and let us find a way to America. Every 
Saturday and Sunday my family went to the church to pray. Here I have never 
gone somewhere far away before because no one took me but someday I will go to 
Disneyland, Hollywood and Disneyworld. I always wanted to visit that place. 
</P>
<P>
I like to live in this Orange County because it helps my family a lot of things 
like we don't have any money, so they gave us some. They gave us medical and 
when we are sick we can use medical to buy med. Thank you for helping me all 
that things Orange County and God will bless you.

FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT: TONY CIRCLES THE GLOBE; 
</P>
<P>
BOY PILOT CROSSES U.S., BUT EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS 
</P>

<P>
Tony Aliengena, the boy aviator from San Juan Capistrano trying to become the 
youngest person to circle the world, crossed the United States on Saturday 
afternoon but landed in Boston with equipment problems. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical malfunctions plagued not only his plane, but one of his two chase 
planes as well. 
</P>
<P>
The autopilot mechanism on Tony's single-engine Cessna Centurion malfunctioned 
during his 2 1/2-hour flight between National Airport in Washington and 
Lawrence Airport, outside Boston, according to his father, Gary Aliengena. 
</P>
<P>
But the chase plane flown by California physician Lance Allyn was forced to 
make an emergency landing immediately after takeoff from National Airport when 
smoke began pouring from the instrument panel of his twin-engine King Air and 
filled the pressurized aircraft, which held five other members of Tony's 
entourage for the seven-week around-the-world Friendship Flight. 
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously injured, although Allyn and all his passengers, including 
this reporter, were treated for smoke inhalation by paramedics after the 
aircraft managed a successful landing at National. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the smoke had not been immediately determined by late Saturday, 
but mechanics who inspected the King Air said a faulty clutch gear was 
suspected. Repairs were expected to be completed by Monday, after which Allyn 
and his passengers were expected to rejoin Tony and the other chase plane in 
Boston by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gary Aliengena, the autopilot mechanism is needed so the 
11-year-old flier won't have to operate the plane manually during long 
stretches of the journey, such as the upcoming flight over the icy North 
Atlantic this week. Gary Aliengena said he hoped the aircraft could be repaired 
in time to resume the journey on schedule Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Tony -- who set out Monday in his father's Cessna perched atop 
a car seat so he can see over the controls -- has logged more than 3,300 miles 
with stops in six U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
The boy will spend today, his first full day of rest, with a visit to his 
grandparents' home in nearby Palmer, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Tony and his family are scheduled to start the day by unfurling a 
1,000-foot scroll that bears good-will messages from more than 250,000 American 
youngsters to their counterparts in the Soviet Union, where Tony is headed on 
the friendship mission. Tony plans to present the scroll to Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
But the scroll ceremony, which is scheduled to be televised on NBC's "Today" 
show, depends on the timely arrival of the scroll, which was being carried in 
Allyn's plane and was to be shipped by commercial air carrier today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cross North Atlantic 
</P>
<P>
The current schedule calls for Tony to leave Massachusetts at mid-morning 
Monday in his father's Cessna for the long journey north through Canada and 
across the North Atlantic to Scandinavia, where he is due to arrive Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tony and the pilots of two other small planes accompanying him flew 
through some rough weather in the United States, their real concern has been in 
crossing the icy north. Tony will be flying through an area where temperatures 
hover near freezing and ocean waters are so cold that it takes only a minute 
for a person to lose consciousness after falling in. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Aliengena was so concerned with the North Atlantic crossing that he 
enlarged the plane's fuel tank to extend its flying range to 1,500 miles 
instead of 900. And he is arranging to have his wife, Sue, and their 
10-year-old daughter, Alaina, fly in a separate plane while he and Tony brave 
the crossing together. The family has been flying in the same plane with Tony. 
</P>
<P>
A jovial man by nature, Aliengena, 39, does not joke about the ocean crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to put a jinx on it," he said last week in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tony's flying range is more than adequate for the crossing -- he will 
be refueling in Greenland and Iceland -- there are two potential dangers. One 
is that his tiny plane could ice over if he cannot break free of clouds. The 
other is that his high-performance turbo engine could simply stall out. 
</P>
<P>
While flying from Denver to Lincoln on Wednesday, Aliengena recalled an 
incident a few years ago in which the engine on his Cessna failed and he was 
forced to glide to the ground without power. The Cessna is capable of gliding 
as far as 14 miles, a statistic that means little over open water. At his 
longest stretch, between Reykjavik, Iceland, and Oslo, Norway, Tony will face 
more than 500 miles of iceberg-strewn ocean. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Cessna has been operating normally, except for a compass that went 
out in thunderstorms over the Rocky Mountains and the autopilot malfunction 
Saturday. Also, the engine has experienced some difficulty maintaining enough 
pressure to climb above 17,000 feet. It is designed to ascend above 20,000 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
In preparing for the worst, Tony attended a water survival course before the 
trip and is carrying wet suits and flares aboard his aircraft. The other two 
planes, carrying an entourage of journalists and film makers, are carrying 
inflatable rafts. 
</P>
<P>
Plane icing was somewhat of a problem for Tony as he winged his way across the 
United States. Between Salt Lake City and Denver, he picked up such heavy ice 
that he was forced to descend rapidly. And en route to Lincoln, ice crystals 
obstructed his view as he cruised at 17,000 feet through the tops of clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Gunter Hagen, a National Aeronautic Assn. observer who is riding in Tony's 
plane to verify a world record, said that icing of a plane's wings increases 
the danger of a stall. He said ice can also build on a propeller, causing it to 
malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn, a Hanford, Calif., surgeon who is piloting the twin-engine King Air 
behind Tony, said that a friend of his got caught in an ice storm over Idaho, 
lost control and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
"He put the plane and his family in the ground," Allyn said, adding that there 
were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid ice, Allyn said a pilot must steer clear of foul weather and detour 
around clouds at altitudes where icing is likely. A factor in Tony's favor, 
Hagen said, is that cloud cover in the northern latitudes rarely exceeds 9,000 
feet at this time of the year, enabling him to easily break free into the clear 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
The arctic cold will be coming after a week in which Tony and his entourage 
enjoyed warm, enthusiastic receptions at each stop. 
</P>
<P>
In Utah, Tony was presented with proclamations from the governor and the mayor 
of Salt Lake City. In Nebraska, he was given a key to the city of Lincoln and 
made honorary citizen of the state as well as its ambassador to the Soviet 
Union. And in Washington, Mayor Marion Barry presented Tony with a 
proclamation. Tony was also treated to a Saturday morning tour of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people across the United States have turned out to sign Tony's 
friendship scroll and get a close-up look at the fourth-grade boy who sports a 
buzz cut and loves to horseplay with other children when he is outside of the 
cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my grandchildren should see something really important, so I just 
brought them out here," said Nebraskan Elaine Muggy, 70, who signed the scroll 
in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Thompson, 36, a toy salesman in St. Louis, Mo., brought his children, 
Jeff, 8, and Alona, 10, to watch Tony's plane land Thursday at St. Louis' 
Lambert International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to show my kids that they can realize their dreams too," Thompson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also waiting at each stop have been knots of local media, which assaulted Tony 
with cameras and questions as he stepped from the cockpit. He patiently fielded 
the same questions with almost identical responses in every city. 
</P>
<P>
In Lincoln, Tony drew applause from both press and local dignitaries when he 
answered a question about his primary message to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be friends more than enemies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Always hovering beside Tony during these news conferences has been his father, 
who invariably has to elaborate on his son's comments because Tony is not 
comfortable at public speaking. Tony became so press-weary in Denver, for 
example, that he cut the questioning short and rushed inside the airport 
terminal. He also tired of the public adulation, breezing by some giggling 
girls in Lincoln who wanted to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Tony reached St. Louis, however, he was considerably more upbeat. 
Not only did he shake hands with well-wishers, but he stood by the friendship 
scroll and handed out autographed pictures of himself with his sister, Alaina. 
</P>
<P>
On the scroll, American youngsters left a wide variety of messages for the 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"Together, we can make the world a better place," wrote Angie Bunch of St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's spend more time making friends than weapons," added Rachel Tiemann of 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
In Nebraska, one scroll signer wrote: "Hey Gorby, let's do lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Garnering almost as much curiosity as Tony have been the three Soviet citizens 
who have accompanied him on the trip. At news conferences, Tony and his father 
always introduce his 10-year-old Soviet pen pal, Roman Tchermenykh, as well as 
Soviet journalists Maxim Chikin, 27, and Aleksei Grinevich, also 27.

WADE BOGGS: LOVE ENDED 2 YEARS BEFORE AFFAIR'S END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite pressure from his agent and his own feelings of frustration, Wade Boggs 
refused to sever his extramarital affair with a Costa Mesa woman for almost 
four years, the Red Sox star said in a sworn declaration he gave recently in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling was totally different the last two years than the first two 
years," Boggs, 30, said in a deposition given May 16 as part of Margo Adams' 
lawsuit against him. "The only way I can describe it is like a volcano getting 
ready to erupt. Tones in her voice, conversations, arguments that we would 
have, these kinds of things just led me to believe that this was not a utopia 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
That slow realization, Boggs said, culminated in a frantic few days in April, 
1988, in which he sought out Red Sox officials, teammates who had had affairs, 
and eventually the FBI for guidance in ending his strained relationship with 
Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs' 555 pages of deposition statements, obtained by The Times, offer the 
most detailed account to date of his version of the affair that has coupled the 
star third baseman with the 33-year-old Adams in headlines across the country. 
</P>
<P>
In a pending lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court, Adams will seek to use 
his statements as a key to her effort to collect hundreds of thousands of 
dollars that she says Boggs promised her as compensation for accompanying him 
constantly on team road trips from 1984 to 1988, and deserting her job as a 
mortgage broker. 
</P>
<P>
A former Miss Stanton, Adams has used her new-found status in the public eye to 
negotiate a recent interview and photo layout in Penthouse magazine, as well as 
to embark on a nationwide talk-show tour publicizing her claim that Boggs 
deceived her. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Boggs, 30, has declined, with only a few exceptions, to talk 
about details of the affair publicly, sticking instead to baseball in the face 
of some speculation that the controversy has affected the hitting skills of the 
five-time American League batting champion, who got off to a slow start this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs explained that silence in his deposition, saying that he believes he has 
been unfairly misquoted in the past by unnamed journalists. 
</P>
<P>
But he was required to discuss the case during the three deposition statements 
that he has given so far to Adams' attorney -- two in Florida in February, and 
the third in Irvine last month, a 3 1/2-hour session that drew reporters and 
photographers to the door of the law office. 
</P>
<P>
In the deposition, Boggs acknowledged that he paid for the travel and 
accommodations of his "mistress" during their continual road-trip rendezvous 
and offered to help Adams resolve the severe financial problems that she said 
the frequent travels had caused her. 
</P>
<P>
And he said that he encouraged Adams, early in their affair, to give up her job 
and find a position that would make it "easier to travel" with him. 
</P>
<P>
But he adamantly denied Adams' assertion that, for the duration of their 
relationship, he paid her $2,000 a month in cash and also agreed to compensate 
her more fully later for her lost income. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't stand for that," he said. "I felt that that's paying for her to be 
a mistress. I felt that reimbursing her on her plane flights and whatever 
expenses she incurred in the city that she was at was sufficient enough." 
</P>
<P>
Struck by "an infatuation" with a woman he first spotted wearing a pink 
miniskirt in an Anaheim bar called Crackers, Boggs said, "In the beginning . . 
. if I could have seen her every day of the year, it would have been great." 
</P>
<P>
But Boggs said the fervor gradually subsided and, about halfway through the 
four-year relationship, he began to think about ending it. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' financial demands began to consume the relationship, he asserted. His 
agent, opposed to the continuation of the affair, warned Boggs about "getting 
in too deep," he said. And foremost among his concerns, Boggs said, was that he 
had an increasing fear that his wife, Debbie, at home in Massachusetts, would 
learn about the affair. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie, married to Boggs since 1976, had learned about previous short-lived 
relationships with other women -- including one in Ohio whom Boggs said he had 
gotten pregnant -- but that his wife had never left him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Boggs said he feared his wife would view Adams' relationship differently if 
she found out. "One-night stands are acceptable, but two-year affairs are not," 
he said in the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
And so, even though the affair was common knowledge among many Red Sox players 
and team officials, Boggs said, he went to great lengths to try and leave 
little in the way of paper trails that could alert his wife. 
</P>
<P>
(The deposition transcript shows that this attempt apparently failed and that 
Boggs' wife tried to contact Margo Adams during the course of the affair.) 
</P>
<P>
Convinced as early as 1986 that the affair had to end, Boggs began dropping 
what he called "subtle hints" to Adams on their road trips, he said, but still 
continued to see her often. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs said he was concerned that Adams might tell his wife about their affair 
and make good on her alleged threat that "if you break up with me, I'm going to 
make your life living hell." 
</P>
<P>
It was not until a road trip in April at the beginning of the 1988 season that 
Boggs said he finally managed to have the "guts" to break off the affair, 
bringing Adams a dozen roses and telling her that she should "come back to 
California and find somebody and fall in love." 
</P>
<P>
But the end was not to be that easy. A few weeks later, Boggs said, he received 
several telephone calls from Adams that prompted him to seek the advice of 
other players, his business associates, his manager and other team officials 
out of concern that he was being "blackmailed." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs said he told his agent "that I got a call from California by Miss Adams, 
that she wanted a hundred thousand dollars or she was going to send pictures, 
plane receipts, itineraries, room keys, assorted collectible paraphernalia that 
she had collected over the four years to my wife in Boston if payment wasn't 
received." 
</P>
<P>
While Boggs has denied that the current controversy has affected his play on 
the field, box scores show that he went through an 0-for-10 slump -- unusual 
for him -- in the midst of these various conversations and that, by June, 1988, 
he was only two shy of reaching his season high for pop-fly outs in a single 
season. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting with team officials and others, Boggs said he decided to "get 
it into the legal hands of the people that should know about it" and filed a 
complaint with the FBI alleging that Adams was trying to blackmail him. That 
prompted federal authorities to interrogate Adams in Orange County as part of a 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' attorney, James McGee, has maintained that Boggs knew the charge to be 
baseless and that Adams was merely trying to recover part of the money Boggs 
owed her. McGee said he may use the FBI incident to expand Adams' lawsuit to 
include claims of slander and infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the state Court of Appeal in Santa Ana threw out a key emotional 
distress component of Adams' claim, but McGee said he is confident that he can 
get all or part of the claim reinstated in light of new admissions by Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
Settlement talks in the case have stalled, attorneys say. Boggs has offered 
Adams $20,000 to give up her claim, and Adams' side has demanded at least 
$125,000.

PLACENTIA STUDENTS GO ON MISSION OF LOVE

<P>
The encounter was tentative at first, with both groups hesitant about the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
But 19 wide-eyed seventh-graders from Orange County, bearing food and clothing, 
eventually broke the ice Saturday with dozens of mothers who carried their 
babies and their dignity at the Fred Jordan Mission in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The students from Tuffree Junior High School in Placentia had raised $1,000 
through bake sales this spring to buy baby clothes, toys and other things for 
the poor and homeless families -- despite initial discouragement from their 
school and some parents. 
</P>
<P>
It was the children of the poor families and homeless people at the Skid Row 
shelter that they had come to help. 
</P>
<P>
On a previous field trip to downtown Los Angeles and the shelter a few months 
ago, the junior high school students said they had been struck by the number of 
families they had seen living on the streets. So on Saturday morning, they 
boarded an Amtrak train from Fullerton to Los Angeles, full of resolve and 
parcels to do something about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
But on their return visit to the mission at Towne and 4th streets, bath time 
for the babies broke the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these mothers live on the street, or in flophouses where they don't 
have bath facilities," Walter Contreras, the director of the shelter, told 
them. 
</P>
<P>
So 12- and 13-year-old girls from Tuffree gently took babies from their 
mother's arms and carried them gingerly to shower and bath facilities on the 
mission's third floor, and washed them in a long communal lavatory. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, the students, mission workers and the families who had waited 
outside in lines, dived into the activities of the day: more babies to bathe; 
cookies to hand out; donated clothing to be sorted and distributed, and a crowd 
to feed at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Placentia youngsters and the people at the shelter had bridged 
the wide chasm separating their lives -- at least a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to be a lot less personal, but once we got in there, we 
couldn't help ourselves," said 13-year-old Niki Frydman of Placentia. "We got 
attached to the little babies. You get close to the mothers, and (want to) give 
them a lot of love." 
</P>
<P>
"I was wishing I had more hands to help the other kids too," added Tiffani 
Milstead, 12. 
</P>
<P>
Contreras said there are never enough volunteers for all the private agencies 
serving the homeless, the unemployed, the poor or those with alcohol or drug 
problems. But he said it is even more rare to see young people helping out. And 
when the students from the Placentia school called to say they wanted to do 
something for the shelter, he said he was overjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else is recognizing there are kids on Skid Row, nobody, until these 
students came along," Contreras said. "Hopefully through showing what these 
students are doing, others will want to act. This is kids helping kids." 
</P>
<P>
The idea to return to the mission with clothes, food and toys was the 
students', said Jim Perry, a world geography teacher who accompanied them 
Saturday, as did Rubin Eloise White, a language arts teacher and gifted-student 
coordinator at Tuffree. 
</P>
<P>
And it came after a field trip Perry had organized as part of his "Trips 
through the Real World" curriculum. Perry, who was selected as outstanding 
teacher of his school district last year, is rare among teachers, say his 
students and his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't think you can teach just within four walls," White said. "Our kids 
get so cloistered and so overprotected -- and we want to protect them. But we 
also want them to know the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
During that first visit to downtown Los Angeles, Contreras took Perry's 
students on a walking tour of the Skid Row area. At one point, they saw a 
mentally deranged man collapse on the street, paramedics trying to revive him, 
Perry recalled. They saw rows and rows of people sleeping on the sidewalk, and 
many children. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a powerful experience," said Perry, adding that he believes 
students need more of a moral education. He said he also tries to teach them 
one important lesson: that knowledge without action is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough to read about homelessness, just like it's not enough for them 
to know how to vote and then not vote," he said. "Knowing and doing are two 
different things, but they go together." 
</P>
<P>
Perry said that some future efforts may be directed at poverty and homelessness 
in Orange County, where he said he and his students recognize it also exists. 
</P>
<P>
Kiran Jain, 12, said Saturday that the lesson hit home on that first visit. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I came here I was really angry," said Kiran, one of the main 
student organizers of Saturday's relief effort. "It just wouldn't go away 
because you knew there were people out in the street. . . . Today, this is 
really helping me because I know something is being done. I know that I've 
helped. I know you can't do everything, that you can't solve all the problems. 
But we can start." 
</P>
<P>
Kiran, whose parents were born in India, said she was upset to learn there was 
so much poverty in the United States. "We're a First World country looking at 
Third World problems right in our own back yards," she said. "It's ridiculous, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the students said they were met with resistance from school 
authorities and some parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of all the legal problems, the school didn't want to get involved in 
it," said Tiffani. "They said it was so close to the end of the school year. 
They wanted us to wait." 
</P>
<P>
Added Niki: "They just thought it wouldn't work, so we just did it on our own." 
</P>
<P>
Perry said his students called Contreras, arranged the bake sales, and even 
called Amtrak to find out how they could get to the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, school officials came around, and Principal George Bowman allowed 
them to hold some of their bake sales at the school. The day before their trip 
to the mission, when mission staff people came to Tuffree Junior High to pick 
up the goods the students had collected, Bowman went to a nearby store to buy a 
tarp and some string to cover the bags loaded in the back of a pickup truck. It 
had just begun to sprinkle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility that we could have done this (as an official school event) 
if we had had more time," Bowman said. "But the school is totally behind them." 
</P>
<P>
He said it is unusual for a group of junior high students to get so involved in 
such a selfless project. He said the motivation comes from Perry. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have someone who's as creative as he is, and has a way with students, 
then things are going to happen. That's what education is all about -- kids 
getting involved," Bowman said.

PERIL OVER D.C.: SMOKE FILLS CHASE PLANE'S CABIN

The first sign of trouble came just moments after takeoff from National Airport 
about 12:40 p.m., when pilot Lance Allyn smelled smoke in the cockpit of his 
twin-engine airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the smoke coming from? I smell smoke," Allyn inquired urgently as 
wisps of gray smoke began seeping from the instrument panel of his King Air, 
which was ferrying luggage and members of an entourage for boy aviator Tony 
Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano in his bid to become the youngest pilot to fly 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn and the five passengers in his plane, one of two chase planes following 
the 11-year-old flier, looked around frantically for the source of smoke, but 
they could not tell where it was originating. Sean Hardin, member of a film 
crew accompanying Tony, checked his video equipment to see if it was burning. 
He was riding in the co-pilot's seat to shoot aerials for a documentary about 
the youth's around-the-world flight. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, at about 1,000 feet above the Potomac River, clouds of smoke spewed 
from the instrument panel, engulfing the cockpit and forcing the four 
passengers seated in the pressurized cabin to clutch clothing to their mouths 
to help them breathe. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin grabbed a teddy bear that Allyn keeps on his dash for good luck and 
pressed it to his mouth to filter out the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Both Hardin and Allyn opened small windows on either side of the cockpit, but 
the smoke streamed out too fast for the cabin to clear. 
</P>
<P>
The plane landed safely back at National Airport, and there were no serious 
injuries, although all passengers were treated for smoke inhalation. Tony, who 
experienced mechanical trouble of his own Saturday, was unaware of the 
difficulties with the second chase plane until he landed at Lawrence Airport 
outside Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers on Allyn's King Air said they all feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically thinking to ourselves, 'We're going to die,' " said Guy 
Murrel, 28, a public relations consultant from Costa Mesa who is coordinating 
Tony's flight. 
</P>
<P>
"I was saying the Lord's Prayer," added Sandy Herring, 36, a publicist from St. 
Louis who represents Hampton Inn, a nationwide hotel chain helping to sponsor 
the flight. "I was saying, 'Please, God, don't let it (dying) hurt." 
</P>
<P>
But disaster was averted by the pilot's quick and calm handling of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn, pressing his face close to the open window to breathe, shut off the 
aircraft's electrical system, reducing the outflow of smoke. He then radioed 
back to National Airport that he needed emergency clearance to land. 
</P>
<P>
Although the air traffic controller directed him to nearby Andrews Air Force 
Base, smoke remained so dense that Allyn could not see the air base and was 
forced to turn around to National with emergency clearance. In so doing, he 
maneuvered his King Air through restricted airspace above the Capital's 
monuments and government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting the plane were five fire engines from the Washington Airport 
Authority, positioned alongside the runway with emergency lights flashing. 
During the descent, smoke finally dissipated from the cabin, enabling the 
occupants to breathe freely. Allyn restarted the electrical system only long 
enough to lower his landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
When Allyn guided the plane safely back off the runway, his passengers erupted 
into wild applause and crushed him with hugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's a hero," said Hardin, 27, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers, who also included Tony's Soviet pen pal, Roman Cheremnykh, 10, 
then embraced one another like close family. And on the ground, Roman smiled, 
seeming calm, but he asked to "call Moscow" to speak with his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Life! Life! Thank God!" said Herring, who boarded Allyn's plane in St. Louis 
and was to remain aboard only as far as Saturday's leg to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn, 46, an orthopedic surgeon from Hanford in the San Joaquin Valley, and 
his passengers were treated at the scene by paramedics for smoke inhalation. 
Hardin and this reporter were administered a small amount of oxygen to overcome 
mild dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
Only Allyn, a veteran pilot who has flown his King Air for 10 years, appeared 
unshaken afterward. When asked about his calm demeanor in the plane, Allyn just 
smiled and said, "I was too busy to be nervous." 
</P>
<P>
He added that this was the first time he had experienced a smoke problem in the 
plane, which was manufactured in 1966. The exact problem had not been diagnosed 
late Saturday, although mechanics suspected a failed clutch gear. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Trageser, a business jet pilot at National Airport's Butler Aviation, 
where Allyn's plane was towed for repair, said that smoke in the cockpit 
generally affects only the electrical system -- not the engines that power the 
aircraft. But he said the smoke was still extremely dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem," Trageser said, "is becoming overcome by smoke."

DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS IN 2 CITIES LEAVE 3 MEN WOUNDED 
</P>

<P>
Three men were wounded in two separate drive-by shootings in Buena Park and 
Westminster, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Angulo, 27, of Fullerton and an unidentified 16-year-old from Buena Park 
were shot at 11:30 p.m. Friday while attending a party in the 6500 block of 
Kingman Avenue, a residential area in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a large party," a Buena Park officer said. "It was attended by a 
significant number of young people who were affiliated with several different 
gangs from the Orange County area." 
</P>
<P>
Angulo was shot once in the right shoulder and was listed in satisfactory 
condition at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. The juvenile was shot in 
the area of his left chest and arm and was in stable condition at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspects in that shooting were a group of four or five men who 
tried to attend the party uninvited. After they were denied entrance, the men 
allegedly climbed into their car, which police describe as a cream-colored GM 
vehicle, and fired several shots into the crowd as they drove by. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hiding under the bed," said Jane Vela, 63, a neighbor. "We were really 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate drive-by incident, Francisco Mariscal, 29, of Costa Mesa was shot 
in the hip at 3:20 a.m. Saturday while standing on the front porch of a house 
in the 7000 block of Plaza Street. 
</P>
<P>
Mariscal was in stable condition Saturday at Humana Hospital-Westminster.

What do you give a girl who has nearly everything? How about a teddy bear? 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans, world-class distance swimmer, treasures a stuffed animal as much 
as the three gold medals she won in the Seoul Olympics last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The teddy bear was a present from one of her teammates at El Dorado High 
School. But the entire team presented it to her at the Southern Section 3-A 
finals in May. 
</P>
<P>
"It was from my secret pal on the team," Evans said. "Everyone on the team has 
one, and we give each other little gifts before every meet. But this one was 
from everyone. They all signed a card and gave it to me. It was neat." 
</P>
<P>
For Evans, The Times' Orange County girls' swimmer of the year, the gift marked 
the end of an illustrious high school career. 
</P>
<P>
While at El Dorado, Evans competed in four Southern Section championship meets. 
Including relays, she won 10 Southern Section titles.

"I've always liked the Southern Section meet," said Evans, who will attend 
Stanford on a swimming scholarship in the fall. "It was fun to compete with a 
team. I like being with my peers." 
</P>
<P>
Evans has had few of those in the pool, especially on the high school level. 
She holds national high school records in the 200-yard individual medley and 
500 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 3-A meet, Evans broke her national high school record in the 200 
individual medley with a time of 1 minute 59.96 seconds. She also won the 500 
freestyle in 4:38.34, missing her national mark by a second. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also helped El Dorado's 200 medley relay team finish first. The Golden 
Hawks finished second at the meet. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place finish is Evans' fondest memory of her high school 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really exciting," Evans said. "It was the highest El Dorado has ever 
finished. That was special. I'm glad I was a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
For Evans, the high school season was a welcome break from the rigors of 
international competition. It was a chance to be with her friends and have a 
little fun. She regularly swam in events other than her specialties in dual 
meets, as well as swimming on relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to swim the 100 backstroke and 100 breaststroke during dual meets," 
Evans said. "I could never do that on the international level. I'm a distance 
swimmer; there's no way I could beat the best in the world in the 100-meter 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school swimming, I get to be with my friends. That's the best part." 
</P>
<P>
It may sound odd, but Evans has actually lost a high school race in the 
Southern Section championship meet. Of course, that was back in those 
pre-legend days when she was a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing in the 200 individual medley in 1985, she has won every individual 
championship race. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it's over already," Evans said. "High school went by so fast. 
It's hard to imagine not swimming in high school anymore. It's a little sad."

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: BOONE RUNS UP FANCY NUMBERS AFTER GETTING HIS ROYAL WELCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

KANSAS CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here's how well things are going for Bob Boone: 
</P>
<P>
He hit a triple last week. 
</P>
<P>
Not just any triple . . . a stand-up triple. Boone hits those about as often as 
USC goes to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that Boone is 41, which means you don't bother timing him with the 
second hand, but with the minute hand. He runs as if he's dragging an anvil. 
</P>
<P>
So naturally when Boone records an honest-to-goodness triple, only his fifth in 
his last 3,893 at-bats, you notice. Boone certainly did. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he returned to the dugout that afternoon in Seattle and celebrated the 
rare baserunning sprint with "a drink of water and a respirator." Asked later 
if he felt a little bit like a 25-year-old, Boone couldn't suppress a laugh. "I 
don't think I ever had the body of a 25-year-old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boone can joke about such things: his glacial speed, his age, his occasional 
line drives that skip past onrushing outfielders for triples. Life is good 
right now, even if Kansas City, rather than Anaheim, is where Boone collects 
his $883,001 paycheck, exactly one dollar more than the Angels paid him last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He shouldn't be here, of course -- at least, not dressed in Royal blue. He 
still should be wearing an Angel uniform, but he isn't because of assorted 
circumstances, beginning with the off-season acquisition of Lance Parrish and 
ending with a difference of pitching philosophies with the coaching staff. 
Their loss. 
</P>
<P>
Boone was a team treasure and you do what you can to hold on to those. Instead, 
the Angels decided they could do without Boone's Gold Glove, his 16 years of 
major league experience and a revived hitting stroke (a career-high .295 in 
1988). When he signed a one-year deal with the Royals, the Angels waved goodby 
with mixed feelings. They'd miss him, but they'd get over it. After all, they 
had Parrish, which meant not paying Boone almost $1 million to presumably 
become a backup. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Angels' post-contract comments -- Boone never allowed the Angels to 
counteroffer . . . Boone wanted a full-time job. . . . Boone could have stayed 
had he wanted to -- don't entirely believe them. 
</P>
<P>
True, Boone took the Royal offer without notifying Angel management. 
</P>
<P>
True, Boone preferred to start. 
</P>
<P>
And true, owner Gene Autry would have fattened Boone's wallet even more had he 
stayed. 
</P>
<P>
But why should he have remained? The Angels didn't lift a pen to sign him until 
it was too late. They all but had guaranteed Parrish a starting position. And 
more money? The Angels missed the point, as well as the boat. Boone didn't want 
more money; he wanted respect. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals gave it to him. The Angels didn't. 
</P>
<P>
So here he is, cruising along with a .281 batting average, thoroughly enjoying 
himself as the Royals inch closer to overtaking the Angels in the American 
League West standings. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him yesterday, 'This is about the time of the year you went from .190 
to hit about .350 the rest of the year,' " said Royal Manager John Wathan. "He 
went five for five off us about this time last year. I told him we'd take that 
again if he'd like to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Boone is doing what he can to oblige the request. Friday evening, Boone singled 
twice and scored once as the Royals won. Saturday night, in another Royal 
victory, Boone added a single and a run scored. 
</P>
<P>
And don't think, in his own private way, he didn't savor every hit and win. For 
as much as Boone tries to sustain this image of the consummate professional, 
there must have been a tiny part of him that whooped it up as the Royals 
extended the Angel losing streak to three games Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to talk to (former Angel) Doug DeCinces about it," Boone said. "He 
always did well against Baltimore. He was always telling me how much fun that 
was. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never played against a former team," he said. "I think it's fun. It's a 
little more emotional when you're hitting off somebody you know real well. 
There's a level of competition that gets juiced up a little bit. But I don't 
see it as being vindictive or vengeful at all. There's a little more of an 
edge. From a personal standpoint, there's a little bit more of a playoff 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Boone hasn't decided if he'll return for an 18th major league season. He said 
his bat and glove will help him decide, much like those same tools helped Mike 
Schmidt call it quits when age outdistanced ability. Other than that, Boone 
remains vague about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk about a career, asking how long do I want to play," he said. "I don't 
know. I enjoy it, but that's not really a factor. The only factor is whether I 
can play or not. Obviously, right now I can. But next year, I don't know. When 
that decision has to be made, that's when I'll sit down and evaluate it. 
</P>
<P>
"I do know I won't go in and talk to (Royal General Manager) John Schuerholz 
about a five-year deal. I'm just looking at one year at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing wrong with professional prudence. A year here. A year there. No need 
making predictions you can't keep. 
</P>
<P>
"When I sat down and became a free agent, without knowing all the 
circumstances, you say, 'Where will I fit in best?' " Boone said. "This was my 
first choice. Fortunately for me, (the Royals) thought the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Halo followers, the Angels didn't.

COULDN'T LIVE WITH HER, CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER; 
</P>
<P>
A VIRTUOUS WOMAN BY KAYE GIBBONS (ALGONQUIN BOOKS: $13.95; 158 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Heeger, Heeger is a fiction writer and an associate editor at Los 
Angeles magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blinking Jack Ernest Stokes has lost his beloved wife, and his story begins 
with a cry of helplessness: "She hasn't been dead four months and I've already 
eaten to the bottom of the deep freeze." A virtuous woman who understands the 
link between emotional need and hunger -- not to mention her husband's domestic 
ineptitude -- Ruby has spent her last cancer-ridden days feverishly cooking for 
him. The question that now haunts Jack's anguished solitude is whether he will 
make it on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Told in alternating chapters by Jack and Ruby herself (during some vaguely 
defined present before her death), "A Virtuous Woman" explores the nature of 
love and dependence, the rewards of marriage and the differing needs of men and 
women. The narrative method is most successful early on, when the two voices 
are used to dramatize the alienating force of grief and its power to summon 
longstanding resentments between two people who love each other. Jack, for 
example, tells of his last visit to Ruby in the hospital, of bidding her good 
night and watching her bring her fingers to her lips, "like either she was 
blowing me a kiss or telling me to hush a little." Instead, he realizes 
bitterly, the gesture has nothing to do with him; she is asking for a 
cigarette. Ruby, for her part, is enraged by Jack's initial, breezy denial of 
her illness. ("Shoot, woman! . . . Anybody mean as the old squall'll outlive 
everybody.") Her anger -- that when she needs him most, he is his usual, 
insensitive self -- reminds her of witnessing her grandfather's conduct toward 
her dying grandmother: "He'd take her arm and pat and rub it back and forth, 
back and forth, and then she'd jerk it away like he'd burned her. Then he'd 
realize he was rubbing the place where she'd had so many shots. But he'd take 
that arm and do the same thing every single visit, same thing, not thinking." 
</P>
<P>
The remembered scenes -- full of her grandfather's chitchat and her 
grandmother's fury ("Go straight to hell! Leave me alone!" she finally screams) 
-- are the most powerful in the book. They leave one wishing that Gibbons had 
continued to use the dual narrative to illuminate both the dark corners and the 
sweet comforts of a long marriage, even at the risk of showing her characters' 
flaws, their periodic selfishness and small-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, as the book progresses, she changes course and attempts to portray a 
perfect marriage. Her characters soon lose all credibility in their nonstop 
goodness toward each other; their voices run together into an aimless monologue 
full of homilies about the simple life and the value of seeing the best in 
everything, including the inevitable, trashy people of this world. Too often, 
lacking a conflict of its own, the story wanders off to peek in at the 
neighbors; pages are spent on the meanness of peripheral folk, whose main 
raison d'etre is to show up Jack's and Ruby's saintliness and to raise the 
question of why bad things happen to good people.

By the end, the book rambles to a halt without much sense of accomplishment or 
development or change. "Folks in town think too much!" exclaims Jack at one 
point, suggesting an attempt to head off critics longing for some reflection -- 
one of the purposes and luxuries of literature -- instead of endless remembered 
facts and canned wisdom. (Example: "You can't change people and that's that and 
you have to just go on and do the best you can. . . .")

In contrast, "Ellen Foster," Gibbons' stunning first novel, which won the Sue 
Kaufman Prize of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, 
features a spunky 11-year-old hurtling roughshod through life learning lessons 
the hard way as she seeks a stable home. Though both novels portray simple 
people battling adversity, Ellen has a wry, idiosyncratic voice free of Jack's 
and Ruby's country-music-style cliches. Where Jack has seen it all and can't be 
surprised or altered by what he sees, Ellen is vitally alive to experience and 
her rewards are doubly satisfying for the considered and persistent nature of 
her quest.

What seems clear is that while the Stokeses never fully seized their creator's 
imagination, "Ellen Foster" took over and turned Gibbons inside-out with the 
inspired urge to give young Ellen substance and voice. Since such a gifted 
writer is bound to bring forth more wonderful books, it would be wise to start 
with her best one (now a Vintage Contemporaries paperback), skip "A Virtuous 
Woman" and wait for what comes next.
