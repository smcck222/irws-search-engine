* Proposal Passes, 2-0: Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) got hitched last week in a 
very, very private wedding. Conyers married Monica Ann Esters, 25, who was born 
in 1964 -- the same year the youthful-looking, 61-year-old Conyers won his 
first congressional election. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would he have gotten married? What are people saying? What's the 
scuttlebutt?" Julian Epstein, Conyers' chief of staff in Washington, asked when 
queried about the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
* Confrontation: Prison author Jack Henry Abbott confronted the widow of his 
stabbing victim in court in New York Friday and demanded: "Does anything matter 
to you except that Richard Adan died at my hands?" A teary-eyed Ricci Adan, 31, 
said: "There has to be some restitution. Some kind of payback" for the loss of 
her husband nine years ago. Abbott, author of "In the Belly of the Beast," won 
early release in 1981 with the help of author Norman Mailer. 
</P>
<P>
* What if It Was Refused?: An 1847 letter from Charlotte Bronte to the 
publisher of her novel "Jane Eyre" sold Thursday at Christie's auction house 
for $52,800. The letter tells how she was unable to pay for the mailing of the 
manuscript. "If when you acknowledge the receipt of the (manuscript) you will 
have the goodness to mention the amount charged on delivery, I will immediately 
transmit it in postage stamps," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
* Another First: Houston Police Chief Elizabeth Watson, the nation's first 
woman chief of a major city, once again made history when she announced she is 
pregnant. Watson, 40, said last week she and her husband, Sgt. Robert Watson, 
are expecting their third child. Watson was named chief in January. She will 
appoint a temporary chief and commented: "I will be only a phone call away."

INTO THE NIGHT / KEVIN ALLMAN: HIPSTERS DIVE INTO ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Saturday night's opening of Arena, the latest private club on the 
Hollywood scene. Held at the site of the Circus Disco on Santa Monica 
Boulevard, the club is the brainchild of Christian Farrow and Jeffrey Sanker, 
and the opening night was held with Interview magazine, cementing its hip 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Is Arena the latest thing? Or is it strictly for the Valley crowd? 
It's probably a moot point anyway, considering that your average club has all 
the shelf life of fresh pasta, and none of the nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: By midnight (still early by club standards), the only notables 
on hand were actress Mary Woronov, Marilyn Monroe impersonator Jimmy James, 
"Cry Baby" star Kim McGuire, and designer Allee Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Judging from the crowd, the '70s aren't coming back; they're 
already here. Among the circa-1976 highlights: Gold lame cutoff shorts, silver 
lame jackets, clear plastic trousers, bondage gear, hairdos in the shape of 
bird cages, and tank tops that could have come straight from Fire Island. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: None. This is a club, after all, and any good club-hopper gets all the 
nourishment he or she needs from alcohol and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Decor: Nothing special, except for the costumed cigarette girls who cruised the 
crowd, vending cigarettes, cigars and plastic ray guns. Huge blowups of the 
cover of the current Interview magazine hung over the crowd, with King 
Kong-sized images of Madonna. Also decorative were a quartet of go-go girls and 
muscle boys in their underwear, who did the wild thing on a platform over the 
dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Lots of overheard conversation. "Did you see that guy?" asked one 
excited guest. "He was a big producer and I shook his hand!" "I have such fond 
memories of the East Village." "I heard that Liz Taylor's lover's out in the 
parking lot!" And best of all: "Would you take our picture? Somebody already 
did, but it's going to appear in some Italian magazine and we'll never see it." 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: Despite the high ceilings, the muggy weather and crowded conditions 
kept oxygen at a premium.

THE HOME GIRLS by Olga Masters W.W. Norton $18.95, 194 pages 
</P>
<P>
Olga Masters is dead now, and safe; the people she bad-mouthed may stamp their 
feet and shout, but they can't get to her. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Masters got a late start writing fiction. She married at 21 and raised 
seven children. Not until her 50s did she find the time to write these scalding 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
By that age, people tend to think of you as invisible (especially with all 
those kids). 
</P>
<P>
It would be as if the dog you kicked for years and years suddenly came in 
through the doggy door with a press pass tucked in his collar, pulled a chair 
up to his computer, shook out his paws and began to tap out a story on the keys 
-- a story of a lummox dog owner who not only kicked his dog, but had bad 
breath, a disgusting paunch, vile sexual habits and a dull personality. 
</P>
<P>
You would be taken off guard if you were that dog's owner. You might feel 
aggrieved. If you had known that dog would acquire both an IBM computer and a 
fine narrative style, then surely you would have treated the dog better -- 
given him canned food to eat, and saved your brutish kicks for guinea pigs, who 
surely will never learn how to write. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, you'd feel sad, wouldn't you? Because dogs are supposed to 
love you no matter what you do, and soon you would read that during all your 
years together, your furtive, frightened cur hated you with all his canine 
might. 
</P>
<P>
And so women are supposed to love the men who beat them (or at least this was 
supposed to be true in the Great Depression years when most of these stories 
are set), and women are supposed to love the children who rob them of their 
youth. And children are supposed to love fathers who beat them (and forget to 
go to work, and lie), and children should love mothers whose only delight is to 
inflict misery on anyone weaker and sadder than they. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Masters had 50 years of injustice, of poverty, of disrespect, of contempt 
in her life, and she finally responded with a hatred as cold and blinding as 
sleet. 
</P>
<P>
There are 20 stories here, 18 set in rural Australia, about two-thirds of them 
placed in the Great Depression. The country is not important here; the poverty 
is. Reading these pieces brings back memories, or memories of other people's 
stories, to the front of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Who, reading this review, can remember being so poor that not finishing dinner 
is a dreadful, dreadful sin? Or that using a match to light a cigarette -- 
instead of bending over the stove to use the fire already there -- is a serious 
diminishment of the family wealth? Who, reading this review, rushes to make 
beds as soon as the children are out of them, because good housekeeping is the 
pride, the only pride of the very poor? Who, now, irons sheets all day? 
</P>
<P>
"The Home Girls" of the title story come from an orphanage, but everyone here 
is orphaned, miserable. The men have no work, or they work as hard as slaves. 
In half a dozen stories, wives go mad from the strain of their dreadful lives; 
they let the kitchen fires go out, they leave breakfast and dishes on the table 
for weeks at a time. They mount pitiful campaigns to keep their kids from being 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these stories are seen through the eyes of children -- children so 
starved for love that just the use of a nickname -- "Pinkie" or "Honey" or any 
careless endearment -- melts their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
It would take so little to make these children happy. But a mother on a train 
tells a stranger she's going to kill her two children. And in "The Snake and 
Bad Tom," a brood of brothers and sisters sell out their half-wit brother to 
their father's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
The father is a sadistic sociopath. Well, Olga Masters seems to say, aren't 
they all? It's poverty that does it -- close quarters, no hope, too many 
children, no money at all. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no one reading this review will remember or recognize these unspeakable 
circumstances. But they can read about them elsewhere, in the Metro section of 
this very paper. 
</P>
<P>
And someday the survivors of all those crimes, misfortunes and disasters will 
sit down at a computer and remember. Those who abused them will be, no doubt, 
the astonished -- and aggrieved. 
</P>
<P>

Century" by Daniel B. Botkin (Oxford University Press).

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: SAFE TURKEY STUFFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: The last time the family gathered together for dinner was a very 
memorable occasion -- we all got sick. We had turkey, and then our doctor had a 
lot of patients. 
</P>
<P>
He said we had food poisoning, and that the stuffing was probably responsible. 
Is there any way to avoid this without eliminating the stuffing? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Harmful food bacteria can grow in stuffing. This may be avoided by 
getting the stuffing to a high temperature quickly, and one way to accomplish 
this is to prepare the stuffing separately. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you would rather stuff the turkey, do so just before you cook it. 
Stuff the turkey loosely, and remove the stuffing right after the turkey is 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Solomon is the author of "Sick &amp; Tired of Being Sick &amp; Tired," 
Wynwood Press. If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 
36184, Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. Solomon cannot give personal replies but will 
answer as many questions as possible in his column.

SNAZZY MOVES AMID THE MELODRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jazz Dancers, Inc.'s Dennon and Sayhber Rawles offer some pretty snazzy jazz 
dancing, but they tend to get in their own way. Their concert Friday at Loyola 
Marymount was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
In a mixed bill of new and familiar dances, the seven-woman, two-man troupe 
alternated between clearheaded, ably-danced choreography and cloying 
theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
In "Tribute to Brubeck" (1979, updated), the ensemble took off with showy moves 
in an aptly asymmetrical choreography. But in "Dream Time" (1989), the dancing 
went heavy on the hair-tossing and light on the choreographic ingenuity, 
although the number did benefit from the accompaniment of composer Randy Strom 
(who played the Chapman stick, an electronic string instrument), cellist Daniel 
Ross Bortz and percussionist Brad Dutz. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd-pleasing "Tango Apasionado" (1987/89) stood out because it offered a 
chance to see the Rawles at their most electric: in a precisely partnered duet, 
full of dramatic lunges and lifts. 
</P>
<P>
The last 30 minutes of the bill were devoted to a work-in-progress called 
"Inside Looking Out," a suite still in need of time at the drawing board. 
Moving in the direction of dance-theater -- with the saccharine story of an old 
woman who watches and joins in the antics of the young folks outside in the 
park -- the choreographers have, unfortunately, nearly eliminated the dancing 
to make room for the melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
Performances continue June 15 and 16. JAN BRESLAUER

Film Justice: New Jersey Chief Justice Robert Wilentz, who annoyed officials in 
Trenton when he blocked filming of "Bonfire of the Vanities" at the Essex 
County Courthouse, has appointed a committee to decide whether New Jersey's 
courthouses should be used as movie sets. Officials said that the move was 
designed to establish policies that could be used as a guide in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The committee includes representatives of the film industry, the academic world 
and the news media. Wilentz has been hit with a federal suit charging that he 
violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech when he stopped 
Warner Bros. from filming scenes from "Bonfire" in the courthouse. The scene, 
subsequently filmed at a Queens courthouse in New York, showed Morgan Freeman 
as a black judge dismissing charges against Tom Hanks as a white stockbroker 
accused of killing a black teen-ager in a hit-and-run accident. Wilentz also 
objected to another sequence that showed black spectators rioting in a corridor 
outside a courthouse. GREG BRAXTON

Miriam Makeba Home at Last: Miriam Makeba, the South African-born singer hailed 
as "Mama Africa" for her passion and popularity, sang on home soil for the 
first time in 31 years Sunday after returning from political exile to visit 
family and her mother's grave in Johannesburg. The 57-year-old Makeba joined 
relatives, local entertainers and supporters in singing the black liberation 
anthem "Nkosi Sikele i'Afrika," or "God Bless Africa." She told reporters that 
she did not "sleep for a week" in anticipation of getting an entry visa, which 
was refused her until Friday. GREG BRAXTON

POP CAPSULES : DAYNE UPGRADES WEAK MATERIAL WITH SOULFUL SINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Taylor Dayne had years of operatic training to fine-tune her 
mezzo-soprano voice. When she cranks it up, as she did often at the Greek 
Theatre on Friday, it's dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, though, that voice was wasted. 
</P>
<P>
Dayne's problem has always been that her material isn't good enough to provide 
an adequate showcase for her glowing voice. Her two albums boast a batch of Top 
10 singles -- but none are first-rate songs. Some of her biggest hits have been 
ballads sporting schmaltzy lyrics, like "Love Will Lead You Back" and "I'll 
Always Love You." 
</P>
<P>
Still, alternating between R&amp;B wailing and Tina Turner-style belting, Dayne 
did manage to upgrade some below-average material by singing soulfully and with 
sheer ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek audience seemed indifferent to the limitations of her material. 
Supported by a large cast of singers, dancers and musicians, Dayne cannily 
manipulated those fans with charm, wit and often-startling raunchiness (she 
raised both temperatures and eyebrows with her lascivious moves on the dance 
numbers). By the end of the show, she had whipped the crowd into a frenzy.

POP CAPSULES : THE 'PUS AT THE PALACE: FEROCIOUS, CONFUSED

Psychefunkapus is not the title of a new Red Hot Chili Peppers album, but the 
name of the San Francisco quintet that played a heavy mixture of funk, 
speed-metal and hard rock -- just like the Red Hot Chili Peppers -- at the 
Palace on Friday. The band hit even more genres than the Peppers, throwing 
everything from a rush of progressive stadium-rock to a strange brew of Cream-y 
acid-flash into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
But there's one area where the 'Pus can't compare to the Peps: charisma. 
Psychefunkapus features two frontmen, Manny Martinez (black, hard-working, 
punky-gruff) and Gene Genie (white, with a smooth voice better suited to a 
folk-art band than a skate-rock jam). Their ferocious energy couldn't disguise 
a confused lyric stance that one moment advocated affirmative youth power ("We 
Are the Young"), then disparaged a woman as a "Slut Child" the next. For now, 
Psychefunkapus is a concept riffing in search of a hook, rocking loud yet 
saying nothing. CRAIG LEE

SHOK-T'S 'RING OF EMERGENCE' AT GENERATOR EIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes at the Generator Eight festival, you take authentic, purposeful 
movement wherever you can find it. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the Shok-T company's quasi-ritualistic "Ring of Emergence," 
Saturday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, Jim Berenholtz played a wooden 
flute while perched on one leg, and the python he had placed around his neck 
slowly moved down his arm onto the instrument. Whatever your feeling about 
snakes, the moment briefly took Rene Olivas Gubernick's latest essay in faked 
folklore into the realm of genuine experience. 
</P>
<P>
Impatient and arbitrary in its barrage of effects, "Ring of Emergence" turned 
central themes from many world cultures into a cheap diversion tailored to the 
most limited attention-span. Tired of mask and drum dances? Here comes 
divination with sticks, interplay with seed tubes and that python. Any single 
part might have yielded a potent contemporary work -- Keith Terry and I Wayan 
Dibia proved the point in a recent "In the Works" collaboration. At the LATC, 
however, only the snake understood that you don't abridge a natural process. 
</P>
<P>
In Martha Kalman's dramatic showpiece "On the Way to Becoming," a figure in 
black stalking the periphery of the stage had a weight and integrity that all 
of Kalman's florid, center-stage flailing failed to achieve. Finally, another 
decisive victory for unadorned, non-dance motion occurred in Kalman and 
Gubernick's "Inverted Carnival," with their labored gymnastic duets becoming 
eclipsed but also recontextualized by painter Jean Edelstein's attempts to 
capture them on canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, painting on stage during a performance isn't new (Twyla Tharp 
incorporated it in the original "Deuce Coupe," for example, and Rudy Perez used 
it in an L.A. Festival piece at the LATC in 1987). But Edelstein's graphic 
insights on the the Kalman/Gubernick partnership created an unusual 
transformation on stage Saturday, making her subjects infinitely more 
interesting as models than they had been as dancers. In her jagged black lines 
and patches of pastel, they had found their raison d'etre. 
</P>
<P>
Half the program Saturday belonged to the 39-member LAMD &amp; B, less a 
company than a performing arm of Naomi Goldberg's School of Dance and Movement 
at the Hollywood/Los Feliz Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
With her "Looking in a Fishtank" last year, Goldberg created an endearing 
statement championing the widest possible participation in dance: from an 
infant to a senior citizen, from professional dancers to civilians who just 
gotta move -- and even a former local dance critic. 
</P>
<P>
Love of dance and Goldberg's deft stagecraft again sustained the piece on 
Saturday -- but the five preceding miniatures looked like an annual 
dancing-school recital, of interest only to the participants' intimates and 
blood-relatives. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the divertissements included Joy Hewitt's genial tap number 
"Close Enough," Alder Dixon's fragmentary, sinewy modern dance solo "A Sudden 
Twist," Gary Mascaro's gritty, mime-based drama "The Black Cat" (incorporating 
drugs, sex and a feline on pointe), Goldberg's formal postmodern exercise in 
discontinuity "The Farmhouse Scene" and her balletic "Sonatine" -- ridiculously 
mannered and ineptly executed. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing by Hewitt and Jim Taylor, Joey Letteri, Tina Carlisi, Dixon, Goldberg 
(sometimes) and a few others contradicted the evidence that LAMD &amp; B is 
merely an outlet for wanna be's who play at dance. Therapeutic -- unless you're 
in the audience.

AMERICANS YOUNG AND OLD PLAY WITH FIRE IN THE AGE OF AIDS

<P>
The much-touted reversal in the 1980s of the sexual revolution of the '60s and 
early '70s does not seem to have materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Today AIDS is slowly spreading among heterosexuals, and other sexually 
transmitted diseases -- gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, herpes and papilloma 
virus, to name a few -- have become major public health problems. Yet 
researchers are finding that heterosexual habits are changing slowly, if at 
all. And that means increased risk. 
</P>
<P>
Something quite different is true of male homosexual habits. In the early 1980s 
as the bad news about a strange and deadly immune system disease began to make 
headlines, gay men responded with major changes in their behavior. In San 
Francisco, for example, America's tragic center for the first onslaught of 
AIDS, rates of seropositivity for the virus among gays shot from 1% in 1978 to 
65% in 1984. But in the mid-1980s it leveled off. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because the gay community slowed the epidemic almost to a standstill, by 
reducing their number of partners, using condoms, indulging less in anal sex, 
and staying away from bathhouses that encouraged casual promiscuity. The 
tragedy was that because they were hit first, these men were not aware of the 
threat soon enough and the result has been devastating mortality. 
</P>
<P>
But what will be the excuse for the rest of us? It appears there isn't one. 
</P>
<P>
Take a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March, 
comparing the sexual habits of college women in 1989 with those of their 
counterparts in 1975 and 1986. Most in 1989 were aware of and worried about the 
threat of sexually transmitted diseases. Yet the proportion who were sexually 
active was the same in all three years (about 87%) as was the proportion who 
admitted to having more than one partner in the previous year (about 40%). The 
percentage who engaged in anal intercourse at least occasionally (roughly 8% to 
10%) also did not change significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Given that people are going to be sexually active from their youth, and that 
many are going to have multiple partners, what precautions are they taking? The 
encouraging news from this study was in the area of condom use: regular use 
climbed from 12% in 1975 to 21% in 1986 and then to 41% in 1989. This is an 
improvement, but it still leaves almost 60% of women unprotected. In addition, 
many of those who do use condoms report that they don't always use them. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent studies suggest that men and women frequently lie to their sex 
partners about their sexual history, including whether or not they have ever 
been infected with a sexually transmited disease and that promiscuity has not 
decreased appreciably in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
All these studies so far have been of adults, more or less. Studies of 
teen-agers are more unsettling. Half have begun sexual intercourse by age 16. 
Two-thirds of teen-age girls use no or ineffective contraception; only 15% use 
condoms. Bacteria such as chlamydia and the organism that causes gonorrhea are 
carried by small but significant minorities of teen-agers -- including some who 
have no symptoms. And AIDS is beginning to make its way through their ranks, 
probably beginning with infected intravenous-drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, teen-agers can be expected to be about the last people to 
change their sex habits in the face of health threats -- threats that must seem 
to them as remote as mortality itself. 
</P>
<P>
For people of any age, not to respond to such threats is playing with fire. 
True, AIDS in America remains largely confined to select populations. But this 
need not and almost certainly will not last much longer. 
</P>
<P>
Herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and human papilloma virus -- one 
probable cause of cervical cancer -- are already carried by substantial 
minorities of heterosexuals, including asymptomatic ones. People who are 
sexually active, have multiple partners and lie or conceal the truth, while 
failing to use condoms, are a gift to these microorganisms. This, to these 
organisms, is a major ecological opportunity; they won't let it pass by. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, certain recalcitrant and very ignorant politicians are standing 
squarely in the way of our getting the knowledge we need of America's sex 
habits. A primary example is Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), who has 
publicly ridiculed efforts by the National Institutes of Health to begin a 
major new scientific survey of sexual behavior patterns, comparable to the 
Kinsey surveys of the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Such a survey is crucial to our understanding of how AIDS and other sexually 
transmitted diseases will spread through our population in the future. 
Opponents of such research will bear a heavy burden of responsibility for 
excess illness and death that might have been prevented if we only knew more.

GEOLOGY: HAWAII'S KILAUEA AND WASHINGTON'S MT. ST. HELENS ARE MILES APART IN 
MORE WAYS THAN ONE. ISLANDERS HAVE LEARNED TO GO WITH THE FLOW.

<P>
Fiery tongues of lava from Kilauea Volcano have ravaged this coastal community. 
But compared to some of its cousins around the world, the Hawaiian volcano is 
downright polite. "At least it gives you time. It lets you take what you want, 
and you can watch it," said Leslie Doctor, who stood mesmerized as the searing 
lava bore down on his family's home. 
</P>
<P>
Since the eruption began seven years ago, Kilauea has torched more than 160 
houses, buried a highway and smothered more than 30 square miles in a blanket 
of solid rock. But the disaster has been played out in slow motion and nobody 
has been caught in the lava's lethal grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Compare that with the explosive blast of Mt. St. Helens, which devastated more 
than 200 square miles of forest in a matter of hours on May 18, 1980, felling 
trees like toothpicks. The eruption spewed 540 million tons of ash over 22,000 
square miles and left 57 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the two volcanoes are breeds apart. A glance at their profiles is 
enough to distinguish them. Kilauea has a gently sloping silhouette; Mt. St. 
Helens had a sharp, conelike peak. 
</P>
<P>
But the differences run deeper, as deep as the molten rock of the Earth's 
mantle. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. St. Helens has its roots in friction, appropriately enough for such a 
mean-tempered mountain. The theory of plate tectonics holds that the Earth's 
crust is divided into huge slabs that float on its hot, fluid mantle. As the 
plates collide or grind past each other they cause a commotion on the Earth's 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
In St. Helens' case, scientists believe the Pacific Plate is forcing its way 
under the North American plate, generating the heat for the mountain's 
outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii is a different story. The island chain lies smack in the middle of the 
Pacific Plate, 2,000 miles from its nearest boundary. There are no collisions 
here. The oceanic plate is skating toward Asia at a leisurely pace of only four 
inches a year, hardly enough to rattle an island riding on it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, scientists believe that an extremely hot area deep in the Earth's 
molten mantle, called a fixed "hot spot," is fueling Hawaii's creation. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are engaged in a continuing debate over the nature of Hawaii's hot 
spot. Despite the fact that Hawaii's volcanoes are the most extensively studied 
in the world, no one is sure why there should be such a thing as a hot spot, or 
why it should remain fixed in one location as the Pacific Plate slides over it. 
There are other hot spots around the globe, but the Hawaii spot, which created 
the islands as well as a chain of undersea hills called "seamounts" that extend 
across the western Pacific, is the most dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
The hot spot melts the Pacific Plate that is slowly drifting above it, and 
piles up one volcanic island after another. As the volcanoes age, they float 
away from the furnace, gradually extinguishing their flames. 
</P>
<P>
The process is literally older than the hills. The hot spot, estimated to be 25 
to 40 miles below the Earth's surface, has been gurgling up molten rock 
steadily since the time of the dinosaurs. Kilauea, on the island of Hawaii, 
simply is the most recent to breach the waves. 
</P>
<P>
The hot spot also is feeding Mauna Loa, Kilauea's active neighbor, as well as a 
new island forming off shore. Kilauea's youngest sibling, Loihi, won't emerge 
from the ocean for at least 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"People call this destruction, but it's the way the Earth was developed," said 
Harry Kim, a civil defense administrator grappling with the effects of today's 
flow. "Mankind has simply put himself in the way." 
</P>
<P>
Such geological forces may hold clues to the nature of the volcanic dramas on 
the Earth's surface. Because the ingredients of the continental and oceanic 
plates differ, the molten rock they produce also varies. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the chief factor determining the force of eruptions is the 
content of the magma stored in volcanic chambers. The more viscous, or sticky, 
the magma, the more explosive the eruption. 
</P>
<P>
"If the lava is fluid, gas can escape more easily, like bubbles from a soda," 
said Ken Hon, staff geologist at Hawaii Volcano Observatory, which is perched 
on the lip of Kilauea's summit crater. "Kilauea's lava is fluid, like syrup. At 
Mt. St. Helens, the lava is stiffer, more like taffy. The gas bubbles expand 
but they can't rise through it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, pressure builds until finally the magma explodes with great 
force into tiny bits. Such blasts are called pyroclastic, literally "broken 
fire." It takes much longer for such "stratovolcanos" to build up the energy 
for an eruption. Mt. St. Helens usually rests for hundreds of years between 
blasts. Kilauea's clock runs in tens of years. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian lava, known as basalt, contains less silicon and aluminum and more 
iron, magnesium and calcium than what erupted at Mt. St. Helens. It flows more 
freely, both below and above ground, gradually shaping the volcano's gentle 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
Eruptions in Hawaii typically begin with "curtains of fire," vertical sheets of 
lava that spurt along cracks in the Earth. The fountains often settle on one 
vent and spout like enormous hoses. In the 1950s, Kilauea was called "the 
drive-in volcano" because it was so obliging to people who wanted to watch its 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fountains can be spectacular (one shot nearly 2,000 feet in the 
air), the force behind them is relatively weak. By comparison, the 1980 St. 
Helens eruption sent ash more than 12 miles into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
When the fountains in a Hawaiian eruption subside, either they die or the magma 
migrates down-slope to a site of less pressure, where it oozes continuously 
from the opening. Today's flow is welling up out of the East Rift Zone, a 
weakened swath on Kilauea's flank. 
</P>
<P>
"Kilauea's lava fountains and flows can be seen, usually in plenty of time to 
get out of the way," said Steve Brantley, public information scientist for the 
Cascades Volcano Observatory. "With explosive volcanoes like Mt. St. Helens, 
the sequence of events can begin very, very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Although there were warning signs, including a bulge on the face of the 
mountain, no one anticipated the speed or force of the 1980 St. Helens blast. 
The eruption, according to Cascades Volcano Observatory scientists, was 
preceded by a landslide that dug a gash in the face of the volcano, allowing 
the highly pressurized magma to burst through, like a pressure cooker whose lid 
was knocked off too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd never have that circumstance in Hawaii if you had a landslide that 
exposed part of the plumbing system," said Tom Wright, scientist in charge of 
the Hawaii Volcano Observatory. "You'd get some release, but it wouldn't be 
anywhere near the force of St. Helens." 
</P>
<P>
Explosive eruptions, however, are not impossible even at Hawaii's seemingly 
gentle volcanoes. Occasionally, as magma drains out of a vent, ground water 
interacts with the hot rock and flashes into steam, causing explosions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1790, such an eruption blanketed Kilauea's summit with as much as 30 feet of 
pyroclastic debris. About 80 Hawaiian warriors trekking across the volcano's 
flank suffocated in the hot gas. Their footsteps, still discernible in the ash 
deposits, serve as a warning that, even in easygoing Hawaii, no volcano is 
entirely predictable.

BEHAVIOR: THE SPECIES UNDER STUDY IS MONOGAMOUS, RESEARCHERS SAY. WHAT'S MORE, 
A CHEMICAL IN THE FEMALE'S URINE MAKES THE MALES BABY-SIT THE OFFSPRING.

<P>
Sure there are lots of faithful husbands out there, and many, no doubt, who 
take care of the kids to boot. But here in California (yes another trend is 
being set) there are some female mice who apparently have found a way to ensure 
this type of zealous paternalism in their mates. 
</P>
<P>
Two scientists have identified a species of monogamous mouse native to 
California in which the female produces a chemical in her urine that induces 
the male to take care of the babies. 
</P>
<P>
This is among the findings made by UC Berkeley field biologist David Ribble and 
David Gubernick, assistant professor of psychology at the University of 
Wisconsin in Madison, who are studying the California mouse, Peromyscus 
californicus. 
</P>
<P>
From field observations over the past 40 years, scientists have suspected that 
the California mouse was monogamous. "It's extremely rare in mammals as a 
whole," said Ribble. Although monogamy is common in bird species -- perhaps as 
high as 60% to 70% -- the best estimates are that only 3% to 10% of mammals 
mate exclusively with one of their own species. 
</P>
<P>
But it was just this spring that Ribble, a doctoral student who does his 
research at UC Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, used a technique new to 
field biology -- genetic fingerprinting -- to demonstrate conclusively the 
exclusive relationships between male and female California mice. The data 
backed up field observations he had made in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
To carry out the genetic testing, he anesthetized trapped mice and snipped off 
a tiny tip of their tails to extract the required DNA. In testing 98 offspring 
from 27 families, he found that their DNA matched the DNA from their parents. 
"It turns out they're as monogamous as they can be," said Ribble. 
</P>
<P>
From his observations during the field studies, he also found that males spend 
as much time caring for the young as females do. By putting tiny plastic 
collars with radio transmitters around the necks of several male and female 
mice, he tracked their position for several days before removing the collars. 
He found that they spent equal amounts of time in the nest. 
</P>
<P>
When looking at what kept the parents parental, Gubernick stumbled across the 
physiological basis for male parenting. "It was the presence of the mother that 
was important to keep the males parental," he said. More specifically, after 
much experimentation with exposing males to other female urine and distilled 
water, he determined that it was a strong chemical signal from the urine of the 
male's mate that induced him to take care of the young. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to identify what chemical now," he said, noting that changes may 
occur in the mouse brain during parenting. 
</P>
<P>
Gubernick also has probed the mice's monogamous relationship by investigating 
pair bonding, mate fidelity and mate choice. When he offered females in their 
second estrus another male, they preferred their mates. When two virgin females 
were put in a cage with a male and female that had already bonded, the male 
would not mate with the virgin females. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is very clear in the laboratory that males spend as much time 
caring for the young as the females, Ribble and Gubernick have not observed the 
parenting behavior in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
This summer they plan more field studies to pursue parenting behaviors and try 
to determine if another unusual laboratory behavior also occurs in the field: 
that weaned offspring help raise their younger sisters and brothers. 
Immediately after a female gives birth, she mates again and produces another 
litter a month later, just after the first litter is weaned. But the first 
litter stays in the nest for another month before leaving to establish their 
own nests. During this time, they appear to baby-sit their siblings. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the California mouse has such a complex social system, Ribble 
suggested a complex answer: The mouse, which weighs 40 grams, is about twice 
the size of normal field mice. Usually in mammals the "bigger you are, the 
smaller the litter size," he said. And although four offspring can share enough 
body heat to maintain their body temperature to keep themselves alive, two 
cannot. So a male contributes to the growth of the young by helping maintain 
their body heat while the female leaves the nest to eat. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers have discovered other compelling facts about Peromyscus 
californicus: 
</P>
<P>
* Unlike most mammals, after being weaned from their mothers, virgin females 
roam into new territory to find a mate, while virgin males stay near the place 
where they were born to wait for a female to find them. 
</P>
<P>
* After a female selects a mate, she waits, sometimes for several months, 
before going into estrus to mate, perhaps to see if the male and his territory 
are suitable for raising offspring. 
</P>
<P>
These studies prompted Gubernick to ask the same questions about human males: 
Do men undergo hormonal changes when their wives are pregnant and give birth? 
In a study begun in April, Gubernick is following 25 couples who are 
participating in Lamaze classes from six weeks before the birth of a child to 
four weeks after. He expects to analyze the data in January. "If we find 
something, it will have important implications for paternal bonding," he said.

HORMONE MAY HELP SWEAT DISORDER

Research in animals suggests that treatment with a hormone called epidermal 
growth factor may help in treatment of a rare genetic disorder that makes 
humans unable to sweat properly, Canadian researchers reported last week. About 
one in every 10,000 babies is born with the disease, called hypohidrotic 
ectodermal dysplasia, which causes them to have few or no sweat glands, no hair 
and dental abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
The disorder is not fatal with appropriate medical care, but victims must lead 
a severely constrained lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Biologist Stan R. Blecher and his colleagues at the University of Guelph 
studied mice with a genetic defect that causes a similar lack of sweat glands. 
They reported in Nature that the mice developed sweat glands if they were given 
daily injections of the hormone for a month after birth, although they did not 
develop as many glands as normal mice and did not sweat as profusely. 
</P>
<P>
Because scientists believe the defective mouse gene to be equivalent to the 
defective human gene, the Canadian researchers said the hormone should be 
studied as a possible therapy for babies with the sweating disorder.

We're now at the "elected insurance commissioner" part of our story of 
California's quest for lower auto-insurance rates -- or Phantom Promises, the 
Saga of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
While the legality of Proposition 103 has generally been upheld, the court has 
clearly protected the right of insurers to a fair economic return. This has 
rendered the proposition, in effect, unworkable. To provide the promised 
rebates and premium reductions, the insurers' income would have to be cut, no 
doubt, to levels below what the courts would deem "fair." 
</P>
<P>
So, in the 19 months since its passage, the only thing California policyholders 
have seen is an increase in their premiums to pay for the army of regulators 
needed to carry out 103's edicts. In fact, about 38% of the Insurance 
Department's 1990-91 budget is for Proposition 103 regulation. 
</P>
<P>
From the campaign outpourings of proponents Harvey Rosenfield and Ralph Nader, 
it would appear that Proposition 103's "enforcement" is the only thing our new 
commissioner will have to do. In fact, 103 will only be one of many tasks. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there is a continuing dilemma about the role of the California 
Automobile Assigned Risk Plan and the subsidy of its rates by "good" drivers. 
The plan currently runs an annual deficit that could reach $1 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But that problem pales when compared to the similarity between today's 
insurance business and the early warnings that appeared in the scandal-plagued 
savings and loan industry. A recent congressional report, ominously titled 
"Failed Promises," cautions that "if such warnings are not heeded, the 
insurance industry and the nation could face a solvency crisis rivaling the 
present savings and loan situation." This situation alone could occupy the 
entire term of our new commissioner. As evidence, consider that of the state's 
1,900 insurance firms, more than 200 are under "special surveillance," 10 under 
conservation and 64 in liquidation. In other words, the solvency of about 16% 
is in question. How serious is this? The report says that the collapse of two 
firms (Mission Insurance Co. and Transit Casualty Co.) could cost the public 
about $6.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Or the new commissioner could work on even more devastating problems -- in both 
general economic and personal terms -- than auto-insurance costs. For example, 
in our national frenzy of corporate asset leveraging and buy-outs, unscrupulous 
new owners have liquidated employee pension funds and replaced them with 
insurance annuities, many of which are secured in major part by shaky junk 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Because this practice has continued for several years, the retirement security 
of thousands of American workers and retirees is at risk. Not only is this a 
corporate moral and legal problem; it's also an insurance regulatory issue. 
Have we heard any of the candidates mention it? 
</P>
<P>
As I see it, there are two groups of voters: those for whom 103 produced the 
rebates and premium reductions it promised -- and the rest of us. Candidates 
Wes Bannister, a Huntington Beach city councilman, and state Sen. John 
Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) can opt for failure and appeal to the first group by 
tying themselves to the pieces of 103 that can't be realized or they can use 
what's left of it to try to lower premiums by getting insurers, consumers and 
attorneys to the table without having to return to the costly and 
time-consuming courts. Having laid that issue aside, and because neither 
candidate appears well-versed about arcane insurance problems, they should seek 
knowledgeable, dispassionate and impartial advisers forthe more important 
issues.

<P>
HE RAISES MANY EYEBROWS BY STANDING LENIN ON HIS HEAD;

BORIS YELTSIN AND HIS BACKERS THINK THEY CAN TAKE CONTROL OF THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY. THEY MAY BE RIGHT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Who is Boris Yeltsin? In an age when highbrow intellectuals have flooded into 
East European politics, Yeltsin is a genuine blue-collar figure who fought his 
way up through the ranks in the gritty city of Sverdlovsk. Even as a local 
party leader, however, he rejected the dachas, limousines and other perquisites 
of office. As Moscow's mayor he championed the forgotten consumer and drove 
party hacks from office. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev was quick to sense in Yeltsin a formidable rival. With only 
the slightest pretext, Gorbachev fired him from the post of mayor of Moscow. In 
doing so, he went out of his way to humiliate the popular leader from the 
Urals. Far from crushing Yeltsin, however, this shock catalyzed his energies. 
</P>
<P>
The firing had the opposite effect on Gorbachev, who began shying away from the 
public at large, even while preaching democracy. Twice in the past six months 
he has sidestepped elections, refusing to submit both his additional 
presidential powers and his reform program as a whole to public referendum. 
</P>
<P>
What is Yeltsin's program? To Moscow intellectuals and others not accustomed to 
elective politics, it is frustratingly vague. In economics, he supports "all 
forms of ownership," implying a mixed economy. He wants "a market mechanism in 
its pure form," yet speaks of a safety net for those most adversely affected by 
reform. Above all, he wants thoroughgoing economic reform now, fearing a 
collapse into anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's politics are more radical than his economics. He champions "a 
democratic and civil society" with political pluralism and the separation of 
powers. He rejects Russia's authoritarian tradition, supporting instead both 
radical administrative decentralization and the devolution of state powers to 
the public. Standing Lenin on his head, he argues that "everything must proceed 
from the bottom up and not the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's views on the empire have raised many eyebrows. He opposes both 
military and economic sanctions against Lithuania and other dissenting 
republics and favors immediate negotiations with those wishing to secede. 
Rather than impose a union that no longer exists, he believes that Moscow must 
recognize at the outset the "full-blooded sovereignty" of each republic, 
including Russia. This done, negotiations could then stress the living links of 
common interest that unite the various republics, rather than the problems that 
separate them. As in Central Europe, however, trade among the republics would 
henceforth be conducted at world prices. This would enable Russia and other 
republics to gain control of their resources, as well as encourage them to get 
their own banking systems, foreign relations, flags and national anthems. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has borrowed much of this program from the very separatists in the 
Baltic region whom Gorbachev is trying to intimidate. Unlike Gorbachev, 
however, Yeltsin realizes that even if independent, seceding republics would 
seek close ties with Russia. Yeltsin's program has the psychological advantage 
of accentuating the positive rather than the negative. 
</P>
<P>
By no means are all points of this "Yeltsin program" Yeltsin's invention, but 
it is increasingly being associated with this charismatic figure. Those 
supporting most or all of it now constitute a majority in the city councils of 
Moscow, Leningrad and many capitals of the non-Russian republics. Within the 
Communist Party it is championed in milder form by the Democratic Platform 
group, of which Yeltsin is a member. A single national party built around the 
sweeping Yeltsin program has yet to form, however. Some hope that the 
Democratic Platform faction can take over at the Communist Party Congress in 
July, transform the party into a parliamentary force and drive out the 
traditionalists. Other radicals are prepared to walk out after the congress and 
set up a non-Communist opposition. Still others remain undecided. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Yeltsin and his backers think they can take control of the party. They 
may be right. A survey of party professionals by the Central Committee's own 
staff revealed that 51% would like to see the traditionalists driven out while 
35% think the Democratic Platform group should leave. Where does this leave 
Gorbachev? He faces a genuine crisis that his outbursts of anger and 
condescension toward Yeltsin have only made worse. For a year Gorbachev has 
tried in vain to maneuver between the Yeltsin radicals and the hard-line 
traditionalists. Yeltsin's recent victory as president of the Russian republic 
erodes the middle ground on which Gorbachev has been dancing. But as Yeltsin 
gleefully reminds Gorbachev, it is not too late for the Soviet leader to adopt 
the radicals' program and thereby save himself politically. 
</P>
<P>
This may not be likely but it is at least possible. In spite of Yeltsin's 
bluster, the chief differences between him and Gorbachev are of degree, not 
kind. Gorbachev is leading the country to collapse, Yeltsin argues, not by 
taking the wrong road but by proceeding haltingly and indecisively. Neither 
wants complete privatization of the economy and both favor a strong safety net. 
They are not even so far apart on whether and how to preserve the Soviet Union. 
"Deep down," Yeltsin affirms, "I am in favor of the union not crumbling." 
</P>
<P>
Much evidence suggests that Gorbachev already accepts the need to move toward 
Yeltsin and the Democratic Platform group. In recent weeks, he has spoken of 
the "radicalization of reform" and of the need for more thoroughgoing 
"democratization." He has accepted the secession of a number of republics from 
the union as unavoidable. He has even called for the consolidation of 
pro-reform forces, as if he believes that he himself could still be at the head 
of such a party. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not this proves possible, Americans must be concerned about the 
future of Soviet reform, not just the fate of Gorbachev. Clearly, the 
possibility of gradual reform from within the system is fading, just as it 
faded earlier in Central Europe. But Yeltsin's Lazarus-like return from 
political oblivion shows that the impetus for radical reform continues to 
mount, as it did in Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia and East Germany the democratic forces coalesced so quickly 
that Communist traditionalists had no chance to regroup, let alone make common 
cause with the forces of chauvinism in their countries, as occurred in Romania. 
The possibility of such a counter-revolutionary alliance in the Soviet Union is 
by no means ruled out. However, local and national elections, as well as 
countless opinion polls, indicate that the loose coalition of radical reformers 
-- the Democratic Platform group, independent labor organizations and other 
newly formed regional parties -- are still ascendant. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's politics of inclusion may strengthen this current of radical reform 
and hold its parts together during the crucial transition before and after the 
party congress next month. It would be well for Gorbachev to swim hard with 
this current and not resist it. Otherwise, he might drown.

MOM AS METAPHOR; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN: NOT ALL ARE BORN NURTURERS, BUT THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THEIR HAVING A 
HAPPY FAMILY LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAYRES VAN NIEL, Maureen Sayres Van Niel, MD, is a founder and 
former director of Harvard University's Center for Parenting, and a faculty 
physician at the Brigham and Women's Hospital of Harvard Medical School.

"At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more 
test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal," Barbara Bush 
advised the Wellesley graduates. "You will regret time not spent with a 
husband, a child, a friend or a parent." 
</P>
<P>
It would be lovely if all women's lives were that clearly defined, but they are 
not. There are, for better or for worse, different kinds of women, just as 
there are different types of men. Progress for women in the '90s will require a 
more subtle look at the problems that continue to weaken and dishearten working 
mothers in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
There are indeed some women who are able to put a finger on their clear 
internal priorities, as Mrs. Bush suggests; they realize that they are truly 
happiest when they are nurturing their families. They feel relatively 
unambivalent about being home full-time, working very hard to take care of 
family life, often facilitating a very demanding career for a husband. 
</P>
<P>
It is convenient for everyone when this is the case; the woman has her dreams 
and aspirations fulfilled, the man has love and support for a career that 
usually well needs it, and the children grow up with a life in which their 
needs represent the raison d'etre of someone else's life. Fulfillment of these 
women's passions and attending to their family's daily needs are fortuitously 
synonymous. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, however, many women cannot say that about themselves. While they do 
derive profound pleasure from their family and marital life, they also take 
great satisfaction and a sense of esteem from the work they do outside the 
home. Their talents and temperaments are such that their being home full-time 
to nurture is not the best thing for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Our history is replete with examples of great writers, business executives, 
litigators, scientists and the like whose passions took them away from family 
life for periods of time. Had they forgone an expression of these talents, at 
the end of their lives there would indeed have been regrets. 
</P>
<P>
It has been difficult for our society to face this dichotomized female identity 
for several reasons. First is the collective American fantasy that posts "real" 
women at home every day, waiting for the children as they arrive from school, 
lending an immediate ear, offering yummy snacks and otherwise attending to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
This fantasy demonstrates the difference between wishes and needs. While we may 
all wish for the metaphorical Mom who will satisfy our every need promptly, 
what we actually need in a mother is a woman who knows herself, listens to her 
own internal cues and strikes a balance that will accommodate both her needs 
and those of her family. It has been tough for us to admit that for women to 
realize their potential, often other members of the family, society and outside 
help may be necessary to aid family life. 
</P>
<P>
It has been all too convenient for our society to hold women to the family 
identity alone. In the many years that women were literally disallowed from 
practicing professions and denied admission to institutions, society was 
allowed to avoid its own responsibility to provide support for such necessary 
programs as maternity leave and flexible work hours. 
</P>
<P>
In current American society, basic protections to aid family life are still not 
provided. It is Barbara Bush's husband himself who purportedly plans to veto 
the Family and Medical Leave Act, should he be given the chance. First it must 
get through Congress, of which 96% of the members are men who, no doubt, have 
relied on "nurturers" for maintaining family life. This is the persistent 
double standard with which we live. 
</P>
<P>
There is yet another group of women in the real world, those for whom 
entanglements with children are not a primary priority. They choose not to be 
parents, but to make contributions in other ways. This should be neither 
unimaginable nor the object of needless and wasteful value judgments. The 
fantasy that all women are created to have the ultimate and complete joy solely 
in family life is just that: a fantasy. Women, their families and society all 
stand to gain from a more complete view of women.

THE STYLE IS DEMAGOGUE, BUT LACKING SERIOUSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURRAY KEMPTON, Murray Kempton is a syndicated columnist in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after his election as president of the Russian Republic, Boris Yeltsin 
promised: 
</P>
<P>
"If we last 100 days Russia will be independent . . . Russia's laws will take 
precedence over national laws. We should have our own interpretation of the 
laws on Russia's lands, on property, on the autonomy of enterprises. Treaties 
will be concluded with foreign states bypassing the center." 
</P>
<P>
The center that Yeltsin was proposing to set aside is the state apparatus that 
Mikhail Gorbachev struggles to administer. To read such stuff is scarcely to 
accord its author any place of special portent among the specters now haunting 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
For here is the style of the demagogue. The practice of demagoguery cannot be 
dismissed out of hand, since it is an elemental component of the democratic 
process. But, if he is to be taken seriously, the demagogue must not just 
befuddle the public but make some degree of sense to the managers of society. 
Yeltsin seems incapable of taking that necessity into account. His future is 
unpromising until he does. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has made himself the voice of the Great Russian chauvinism that most 
galls the Russian Federation's sister republics. The last census identified 800 
different nationalities in the Soviet Union. Yeltsin's own Russia is a 
federation of restless nationalities that might be as inclined to declare 
independence from him soon after he achieved the independence he affects to 
declare from the central government. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has never yet failed to mount an overwhelming majority whenever he 
has put an issue to a parliamentary vote. Given that record, it's hard to 
understand why he failed to stop Yeltsin's ascension by applying his inarguably 
formidable party machine to the job. 
</P>
<P>
The assumption that statesmen know what they are doing is one of the more 
common errors in analysis of their policies. But if we grant that Gorbachev 
knew the consequences of inaction, there is no plausible way to explain this 
instance of it except as a calculated decision to let Yeltsin have center stage 
and trust him for a series of pratfalls. That could turn out to be a shrewd 
stroke, because Yeltsin appears to have started without much plan of his own 
and at once betrayed signs of proceeding according to what may have been 
Gorbachev's.

FLAP OVER RED RIDING HOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past few weeks The Times has published an article (May 19) and several 
letters (May 28) about the Culver City Unified School District's decision not 
to include an illustrated version of Little Red Riding Hood in the first-grade 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
This decision was made after discussions with the district's K-12 language arts 
committee, which consists of teachers and various administrators who met 
throughout the year to select a new series of literary-based textbooks which 
will be implemented in the 1990-91 school year. 
</P>
<P>
After much review and the pilot use of several textbook editions in our 
classrooms, the committee chose the Houghton-Mifflin series for Grades K-3. 
This series comes with a set of supplemental paperback books. 
</P>
<P>
An adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood, written and illustrated by Trina 
Schart Hyman in 1983, was part of the supplemental package for first grade. 
After reviewing this particular version of the fairy tale, it was decided not 
to include it as part of the order because the message it gives conflicts with 
the district's curriculum on drug and alcohol abuse. There are many references 
to "grandma drinking wine to feel better" and an illustration which depicts the 
grandmother with a red nose, holding up a full wine glass after consuming a 
half of a bottle of wine. 
</P>
<P>
From the first grade on, our youngsters are taught to say no to drugs and 
alcohol. Alcohol and drug abuse prevention are part of the science and health 
curriculum. The Culver City Police Department works closely with the district 
with its Drug Abuse Resistance Education program and progress has been made 
with students in this area. These are the reasons this version was not selected 
for classroom use. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a case of book banning or censorship. I assure you that there are 
still many versions of Little Red Riding Hood in our school libraries and 
classrooms. However, the fact remains that the district is currently involved 
in a cause celebre because of this book and an explanation is important to 
clarify our action.

BUCHANAN ON U.S. INTERESTS AND ISRAELI-ARAB TENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I noticed that Patrick J. Buchanan had written a column ( "A PLO Trick 
Shores Up Shamir's Web," Commentary, June 3), I expected to see Buchanan's 
typical anti-Israeli-tinged dribble. Predictably, I was not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
First, I found interesting Buchanan's choice of words for the PLO's attempted 
massacre of civilians, i.e., a "trick." How are five speedboats and 16 
guerrillas armed with rockets and machine guns called a "trick"? Then, when 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is rightly outraged by this act he is censured 
because the near-tragedy simply served to "shore up Shamir's web." 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan vituperates against Israel at the end of his article as to the U.S. 
support of Israel, questioning what vital interest of ours was at risk in the 
1967 war. I find it confusing how Buchanan can spend nearly a lifetime opining 
about the evils of totalitarian communist regimes and at the same time not see 
the advantages to lending U.S. support to the only democracy in the Middle 
East.

In response to Linda Blandford's column "Golden Boys, Princes of Darkness," 
Commentary, May 14: 
</P>
<P>
On April 14, a deputy was called to Salt Creek Beach because of juveniles 
throwing water balloons. The deputy contacted the proprietor of the concession 
stand who had called about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy was told a group of juveniles were involved with throwing water 
balloons at beach-goers and yelling obscenities. The juveniles had dispersed 
and could not be identified or located by the proprietor. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy remained at the concession stand and contacted two juveniles and 
questioned their possible involvement. Their information was documented for 
further reference. The deputy handled the situation properly and 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Blandford, a free-lance writer, was at the beach during the disturbance. 
She confronted the deputy and wanted him to contact some additional juveniles 
who were in the ocean surfing with numerous others. Blandford was not sure 
these juveniles were involved in the incident, but she "thought" they might 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy had no reason, based on this reporter's information, to contact 
these two young men, nor was such contact possible. Subsequently, in a frenzy 
of literary misstatement of fact, Blandford's diatribe appeared in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate to have any disturbance of this type at our beaches. Linda 
Blandford has documented her experience based on emotion, not merit and fact.

I was struck by the voluminous biographical data that accompanied the report on 
the Israeli who murdered the seven Arabs (Part A, May 21). It seems all that 
data was intended to justify the reasons why the crime was committed, "deranged 
man . . . dishonorably discharged . . . was jilted. . . ." Can one imagine the 
newspaper explaining away psychoanalytically the predilections of a mass 
killing if the gunman was an Arab and the dead were Israelis? "Home demolished 
. . . could not feed six children . . . desperate for self-determination."

Bip Roberts knew he was in pain the moment his right leg slid across 
home-plate, scoring the winning run Sunday in the Padres' 2-1, 10th-inning 
victory over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The prudent action would have been for him to limp slowly off the field. Maybe 
even sit at home plate, waiting for the trainers to come and examine him. At 
the very least, get up slowly, and make sure nothing was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
His mind kept telling him to react cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
His body had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Sliding past Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia on Roberto Alomar's single to center, 
Roberts leaped to his feet, pumped his arm in the air to the screaming 25,509 
fans at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, and was mugged by the onslaught of his 
teammates pouring out of the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until first baseman Jack Clark picked up the little man in his arms, 
squeezing tight, that Roberts yelled, letting everyone know that he was in some 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
"It really wasn't too smart on my part, either," Clark said. "I could have have 
messed up my back again." 
</P>
<P>
But in times like this, with the Padres winning 12 of the past 16 games, and 
moving to within 5 1/2 games of the slumping Cincinnati Reds, the guys somehow 
forget all about hamstring contusions and herniated discs. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres (30-25), who earlier this week were written off in the National 
League West race by a Cincinnati newspaper, not only are knocking on the door, 
but are threatening to break the damn thing in. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they (the Reds) couldn't stay hot all season," Roberts said, "and we 
weren't going to play bad all season. The way things are going, I think it's 
all going to work out just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and the leg, which had Roberts limping out of the clubhouse late in the 
afternoon after receiving treatment? 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts like hell," Roberts said, "but it would have hurt a whole lot more if 
I was out. I'll be fine by Tuesday. There's no way I want to come out of that 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Who can blame him? With the way the Padres are going, no one wants to take a 
day off any more. 
</P>
<P>
Why else do you think you had relievers Craig Lefferts and Greg Harris pitching 
for the fourth consecutive game? Why else do you think shortstop Garry 
Templeton has taken just one day off since April 26? And why else do you think 
that instead of taking a day off today, Padre Manager Jack McKeon plans to come 
into the stadium and work anyway? 
</P>
<P>
The metamorphosis isn't restricted to only the Padres, either. Would you 
believe it, only one beach ball was sighted in the stands Sunday. No wonder Tom 
Werner, the incoming Padre chairman and managing partner, grabbed his wife and 
abandoned their luxury box seats in the sixth inning, and headed downstairs to 
sit with the rest of the fans for a close-hand view. 
</P>
<P>
"The fun's just starting," said Alomar, who raised his batting average to .336, 
going three for five and driving in both of the Padres' runs. "Ever since we 
had that team meeting (May 24) in New York, we've been playing some great 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing nine innings hard. We never give up. Before, it seems like we 
were giving up when we'd get behind early. 
</P>
<P>
"Not now." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, these same group of guys who had gone six weeks without winning a 
single game when trailing after the sixth inning, suddenly have won three games 
in the past 11 days in which they have overcome deficits in the seventh inning 
or later. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was Dodger starter Ramon Martinez who paid the price. Cruising 
along with a five-hitter through the first seven innings, Martinez found out 
about this Padre magic in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Benito Santiago, one of four Padre regulars who are batting at least 
.300, opened the eighth with a single up the middle. Roberts sacrificed him to 
second with a bunt. And Alomar, who's batting .418 with runners in scoring 
position, hit a double to right-center, scoring Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres appeared prime to put the game away when Tim Crews relieved 
Martinez, and intentionally walked Tony Gwynn, and unintentionally walked Joe 
Carter, loading the bases. But Jack Clark, who had previously struck out three 
times, grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Just how worried were the Padres? Clark popped a bubble with his gum, confident 
that there would be another opportunity. Lefferts and Harris retired all eight 
batters they faced, allowing just one ball to be hit out of the infield. And 
then came the 10th, when the top of the order was up again. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, starting at shortstop for the first time this season, was hit in the 
right hand by Dodger reliever Jay Howell. His next pitch sailed past catcher 
Mike Scioscia, allowing Roberts to scoot to second. Howell then got ahead of 
Alomar on a 1-2 count, but couldn't get that third strike past him, with Alomar 
fouling back four consecutive pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia went to the mound for a strategy talk with Howell. This stuff was 
going to have to stop. Instead of a curveball, they decided, they were going to 
sneak a fastball past Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
Oops. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for a fastball the whole way, and he threw it right where I 
wanted," Alomar said. 
</P>
<P>
So you can guess what happened. Alomar stroked the ball into center field, 
Roberts rounded third, and slid across home just ahead of Kirk Gibson's throw. 
</P>
<P>
Better luck next time, fellas. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are not letting up," Dodger third baseman Lenny Harris said. "It's 
going to be tough to beat them. It's like they are never out of it. It's like 
they are coming at you every inning. These guys were right on us." 
</P>
<P>
Harris was the man who ended Padre starter Andy Benes' no-hit bid with one out 
in the sixth inning when he hit his first home run of the season, and singled 
again in the eighth, driving Benes out of the game. Enter Lefferts. Five up, 
five down. Harris' turn. Three up, three down. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers didn't have a prayer. They got a season-low three hits, and with 
the exception of the fifth and sixth, had just one batter reach base in the 
other eight innings. The Dodgers limped out of town wondering what hit them. 
</P>
<P>
Shh, we won't even tell them that Harris admitted after the game that he is 
pitching with a tired arm, and that Lefferts had to resort to throwing almost 
all breaking balls. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, you have to go out there with a tired arm," Lefferts said. "I was 
thinking of going in and asking Jack (McKeon) if I could have the day off 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
But it's an off day, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to make sure it was an off-day for me too," Lefferts said, with 
a mischievous smile. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who has shown signs of fatigue recently, said: "I think I'm just going 
through a dead-arm period right now. I don't have the same zip I had two, three 
weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
Hmm, so you might consider then going in and seeing the boss, asking for a 
couple of days off? 
</P>
<P>
"You kidding," Harris said. "The way we're going, and at the pace we're 
playing, no way." 
</P>
<P>
So it goes. The Padres win again, making up 4 1/2 games on the Reds in six 
days, and are the closest they have been to first place since May 4. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' secret? Clutch hitting, you say? Maybe late-inning pitching? 
</P>
<P>
Nope, let Werner explain. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Leon Parma, one of the Padres' prospective general partners, was 
traveling in Europe recently with former President Gerald Ford when they 
received an audience with the Pope. The conversation led from one thing to 
another, as Werner tells it, when Parma told the Pope that he soon would be 
part-owner of the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he wanted to know all about the Padres," Werner said, "and he was 
fascinated by the name. Leon then asked the Pope if he could bless his Padres 
pin." 
</P>
<P>
He blessed it all right, Werner said, but then the Pope asked if he could keep 
the pin. What was Parma to do? 
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate for Leon," Werner said, "but that's OK, we're considering 
asking the Pope to throw out the first pitch (in the playoffs or World 
Series)." 
</P>
<P>
And you wondered why the Padres are winning. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego, which leases San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, has approved 
the sale of the Padres to Tom Werner's ownership group, it was announced 
Sunday. Werner and Padre President Dick Freeman will fly to Cleveland on 
Tuesday to the Major League Baseball owners meeting, where he is expected to 
receive approval by the necessary three-quarters vote of the National League 
owners and simple majority vote of the American League owners. . . . Werner 
also announced Sunday the identities of the five new general partners who have 
joined his group -- expanding it to 15: Bruce C. Corwin of Los Angeles, 
president of Metropolitan Theatres Corporation; John E. Earhart of Corona del 
Mar, who is a Senior Fellow for Forestry with the World Wildlife Fund-U.S./The 
Conservation Foundation; Keith Matson of San Diego, developer of Lomas Verdes 
Estates and Old Winery Estates in San Diego; Michael Monk of Los Angeles, a 
partner in the law firm of Pepper, Hamilton and Scheets; and Peter Peckham of 
San Diego, president of Investcal Realty Corporation. "We've got enough people 
now for a partners-players baseball game," Werner said. . . . Werner confirmed 
that Jerry Kapstein, the son-in-law of Padre Owner Joan Kroc, will not be 
involved in any capacity with the Padre front office. "We respect Jerry," 
Werner said, "but we will be talking to him only as a friend." . . . Werner 
will continue living in Los Angeles, but has just leased a home in Del Mar. 
"We're looking to eventually buy a home down here," Werner said, "but please, 
don't tell the realtors." . . . The Padres have signed 29 of their 53 
selections in the June Free Agent Draft. Of the 29 players, there are 11 
pitchers, three catchers, nine infielders and six outfielders. They have signed 
19 from four-year colleges, five from junior colleges and five from high 
schools. The California players signed are outfielder William Adams of 
Altadena; shortstop Brenden Bish of Los Angeles; first baseman David Mowry of 
Glendora; Jeffry Pearce of Sebastopol; and catcher James West of San Francisco. 
. . . Who needs a weatherman when you have Padre starter Andy Benes? Once 
again, Benes' start brought rain, delaying the start of the game. He now has 
had two games rained out this season, two starts delayed by rain, and two rain 
delays in the middle of one game. . . . The San Francisco Giants have shuffled 
their pitching rotation for the Padre series beginning Tuesday. Don Robinson 
still will start Tuesday, but now Trevor Wilson will start Wednesday instead of 
Bob Knepper, and Francisco Oliveras (0-0) will start Thursday instead of Atlee 
Hammaker. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Despite some recent promising performances from Tim Crews and Don Aase, the 
Dodger bullpen situation grew even worse following Sunday's game when they were 
forced to recall a disabled pitcher from triple-A Albuquerque when Pat Perry 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his left shoulder. 
Returning to the Dodgers is pitcher Mike Hartley, who recently was sidelined 
with a strained groin but was scheduled to return to the Albuquerque roster 
this week. In three appearances at Albuquerque, Hartley had two saves with no 
allowed runs. Perry said he overworked his arm during the recent trip, when he 
threw three straight days in St. Louis and Pittsburgh after having not pitched 
since last September.

RAIN AND DUNCAN REIGN AGAIN IN AMATEUR GOLF 
</P>

It likely won't go down as his most memorable, but Pat Duncan will take the 
victory. Duncan was declared the winner of the 58th San Diego Men's Amateur 
Golf Championship after the fourth and final round at Torrey Pines south was 
cancelled because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the second consecutive day that Tropical Depression Boris cut short 
the scheduled four-round, 72-hole event, which was pronounced final after 36 
holes. Duncan, of Rancho Santa Fe, was awarded the victory because he led a 
field of 83 golfers in the championship flight after the first two rounds, 
played June 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
While the 1990 results will go into the books with an asterisk, few will likely 
question the outcome. The victory is Duncan's fourth San Diego Amateur title in 
a row, a tournament record. The 34-year-old has won the event five times, 
another record. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could have played, but it wasn't to be," said Duncan, who was one of 
an estimated 40 players who decided to show up at Torrey Pines Sunday. "I was 
ready to play. I was playing real good (Saturday). I was ready to spend all day 
(to try and complete the third round at Balboa), but it's still nice to win." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan had completed the first two rounds four shots under par at 140 and led 
Rancho Bernardo's John Earle by two strokes. He was playing at three-under par 
through 11 holes Saturday, but at 9:15 a.m. play was suspended and the third 
round cancelled because of sporadic showers and lightning at Balboa Park Golf 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
By 11 a.m. Saturday the skies had become partly cloudy and the rain had 
stopped. Tournament Director John Walter, who manages the grounds at Torrey 
Pines, the site of Sunday's final round, said the course would be playable with 
no subsequent downpour. 
</P>
<P>
But the rains, which dropped .38 of an inch on San Diego Saturday, resumed 
around 1 a.m. Sunday and added one-fourth of an inch between 2 and 3 a.m., 
according to the National Weather Service. At 4 a.m., three hours before the 
scheduled tee-off, Walter declared Torrey Pines unfit for play. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan opened the tournament with a one-under-par 71 at Torrey Pines South and 
trailed 23-year-old Rick Lindemann, a senior at San Diego State who had 
recorded a 69. But in the second round at Torrey Pines North, Lindemann slipped 
into a fourth-place tie when he finished at four-over-par 76. Duncan, 
meanwhile, came back with a 69 to take the two stroke lead that gave him his 
fifth title since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Earle, 28, shot rounds of 72 and 70 to finish second at 142. John Lovett 
finished third at 144, while Lindemann, Jon Erickson and Craig Anderson wound 
up tied for fourth at 145. 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday's round was halted, Duncan, his clothes soaked from the rain, 
sat in the clubhouse coffee shop at Balboa and said jokingly, "Hopefully, we'll 
get cancelled tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
But nobody was hungrier to play than this full-time landscape contractor who 
calls himself "a Sunday golfer." Earlier in the week, Duncan played in the 
Sectional Qualifier to the PGA U.S. Open at San Francisco Golf Club. He bogeyed 
his final two holes in the 36-hole event and missed the cut by two strokes at 
148. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday, he had put the disappointment behind him. After all, he was the 
three-time defending champion of San Diego's biggest amateur tournament, and on 
his way to making it four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, nothing could put a damper on that. Not even the rain.

MAPPLE'S SLALOM FALL GIVES OVERTON VICTORY

Having already accomplished the most difficult of her two tasks -- keeping 
alive her streak of 37 consecutive women's water ski jumping victories -- Deena 
Mapple was primed for her sixth double victory in seven weeks on the Michelob 
Dry Pro Water Ski Tour. 
</P>
<P>
All that stood between it was two buoys in the women's slalom event. Kristi 
Overton, her competitor in the finals, had fallen going into her second buoy -- 
giving her a score of 1 1/2 buoys. 
</P>
<P>
Mapple had probably negotiated two buoys with 40-feet of rope length a thousand 
times. But Sunday's run on Mission Bay was different. Going into the first 
buoy, Mapple overturned on her ski and fell -- giving Overton, 20, her first 
slalom victory of the season and third in two years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taking my skis off and talking to myself, when I looked up and saw her 
in the water," said Overton, a student at Central Florida College in Orlando. 
"I was disappointed in my performance, but I was glad to win." 
</P>
<P>
Though disappointed, Mapple took her upset loss in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a mental lapse," she said. "I was thinking of the whole 
course instead of the first buoy. I have more experience than to do something 
like that. But that just proves you have to earn it." 
</P>
<P>
Overton said Mapple's aggressive tactics surprised her. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised she took (the first buoy) that hard," Overton said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it wasn't too bad of a day for the Mapple family. With Deena's victory 
in the jump at 140 feet over Sherri Slone's 131 and husband Andy's victory in 
the slalom over Lucky Lowe by a half buoy, the Mapple family walked away with 
$9,500 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
Andy's slalom title was his seventh is seven attempts this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes like that," he said. "You get on a roll and you start getting all the 
breaks. I must say the way the things are going for Deena and I are better than 
we ever expected." 
</P>
<P>
Mapple, who won his event with 38 feet of rope length, beat Lowe five buoys to 
4 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't get the fifth," he said. "I had a problem at four because of 
the salt water. My foot came out of the binders and I was barely able to hold 
on." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's freestyle, Dave Reinhart of Defiance, Ohio won by setting a world 
record in distance on one ski -- 77 feet. Reinhart finished with 1,945 points, 
Mike Tolzmann was second with 1,427 points and Dotter was third with 1,407. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Bruce Neville won his first tour event of the season with a jump of 
193 feet, finishing ahead of his countryman, Geoff Carrington, who was second 
at 192. Mike Kjellander took third at 174.

The Coast Guard reopened the Kill Van Kull waterway between Bayonne, N. J., and 
Staten Island, N. Y. Coast Guard spokesman Jim McGranachan said ships using the 
waterway have been ordered to keep their speeds low enough to avoid creating 
wakes that would interfere with crews bagging more than 260,000 gallons of the 
gooey No. 6 heating oil dumped when the British tanker BT Nautilus ran aground 
last week. The cleanup is expected to last at least eight more weeks.

Friends and relatives gathered at the First Unitarian Church in Portland, Ore., 
for a memorial service for Janet Elaine Adkins, 54, who used a controversial 
machine to commit suicide last week in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Adkins had planned the joyful, hourlong ceremony before traveling to Michigan, 
where Dr. Jack Kevorkian hooked her up to the suicide machine he invented. She 
touched a button, releasing an anesthetic followed by a lethal injection. 
Seconds later, she was dead. Adkins was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and 
feared mental deterioration.

Parliament voted to merge Iran's internal security force, the Islamic 
Revolutionary Komitehs, with other urban and paramilitary rural police to 
battle an insurgency and drug-trafficking in the border area with Pakistan. The 
action was opposed by some conservative members who said it was designed to 
dissolve the Komitehs, created after the 1979 revolution partly to safeguard 
the government against counterrevolutionary elements.

Kuwaitis elected 50 members of a transitional parliament in voting boycotted by 
opposition leaders, who are challenging government claims that the new body 
will advance democracy. 
</P>
<P>
No results were available, and it was unclear when they would be announced. 
Unofficial estimates put the all-male turnout at about 55%. The opposition is 
insisting on the restoration of the original 50-member legislature instead of 
the 75-member transitional chamber, which includes 25 members appointed by the 
emir of the small, oil-rich state.

TWO MEMBERS OF 2 LIVE CREW ARRESTED AFTER X-RATED SHOW 
</P>

Two members of the rap group 2 Live Crew were arrested early Sunday morning 
after an X-rated, adults-only performance in Hollywood, Fla., in the latest 
legal move against the group on grounds of obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
Group leader and producer Luther Campbell, 29, and Chris Won Wong, 21, were 
stopped by Broward County sheriff's deputies shortly after leaving the Futura 
Club about 3 a.m. and were booked on charges concerned with the "prohibition on 
certain acts in connection with an obscene, lewd performance," said sheriff's 
spokesman Al Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest came three days after U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled that 
the group's album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" is obscene, making it illegal to 
sell the record in Broward, Dade and Palm Beach counties. On Friday, a Ft. 
Lauderdale record store owner was arrested for selling the album to an 
undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
"They sang some songs from the album that Judge Gonzalez ruled was obscene," 
Gordon said on Sunday. "They were allowed to leave the club and, several blocks 
away, were pulled over and taken into custody without incident." 
</P>
<P>
Two other members of the group had left in other vehicles and were not stopped. 
Gordon said that arrest warrants will be issued for them today. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and Won Wong were booked at Broward County Jail and released with 
notices to appear in court at a date to be determined by the court clerk. The 
charges are first-degree misdemeanors, carrying possible fines of up to $1,000 
and a jail sentence not exceeding one year. 
</P>
<P>
2 Live Crew had publicized the fact that it would perform its sexually explicit 
raps at the Hollywood club, with admission restricted to adults. The group 
offered a milder, "parental guidance" show earlier Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to contact representatives of the group Sunday were unsuccessful.

<P>
A film that equates criminals who rape and murder without mercy or regret with 
the Communist Party's actions during 72 years is already a sensation before it 
opens at Moscow movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The new documentary, "This Is No Way to Live," by Stanislav Govorukhin, breaks 
most of the last taboos left in the glasnost era. 
</P>
<P>
Govorukhin rolls the tragedies of Communist rule, the humiliation of Soviet 
life and his personal indignation at the fate of his country into an indictment 
so powerful it would seem that authorities would have to ban the film. 
</P>
<P>
But the authorities have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry staged a screening. Moscow City Council deputies have 
pledged to bring the movie to cinemas. Govorukhin said President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev himself proclaimed the film "wonderful" after a private viewing. 
</P>
<P>
"For the life of me, I can't understand how Gorbachev could like it," he said, 
sounding distressed. 
</P>
<P>
"This Is No Way to Live" begins with graphic scenes of rape and murder in a 
style familiar to viewers of Leningrad TV's "600 Seconds," a daily program that 
frequently shows grisly crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Then it moves into Part 2: "Criminals in Power." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the 1918 murder of Czar Nicholas II and other members of the 
royal Romanov family, it presents viewers with one Bolshevik crime against the 
people after another. 
</P>
<P>
It documents the mass slaughter of the bourgeoisie under Lenin; the 
artificially created famines; the tens of millions of deaths and imprisonments 
under Stalin; the destruction of churches and liquidation of the priesthood; 
the distortion of people's consciousness with ideological propaganda; and the 
impoverishment of the vast, rich country through idiotic mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
The scenes shift next to the "disgusting humiliation" of everyday Soviet life, 
with its lines, shortages, poverty and moral bankruptcy, and the crooked bodies 
created by such conditions and "70 years of the wrong genetic policy." 
</P>
<P>
"The crimes of Hitler's regime cannot begin to measure up to all this in scale 
and cruelty, especially if you consider that it was done against one's own 
people," Govorukhin says in the film's narration. 
</P>
<P>
Against footage of the post-World War II Nurnburg trials of Nazi leaders, he 
raises the prospect of a similar national trial of Communists. He says the 
organizers of a crime should bear the brunt of punishment. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow News weekly predicted last week that Govorukhin would be accused of 
"malice, mockery and painting everything black" by "the very people whom he 
proposes for a national trial." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by two preliminary screenings and commentaries beginning to appear in 
the Soviet press, however, it is mainly Govorukhin's unrelieved gloom, not his 
political views, that upsets audiences. 
</P>
<P>
One viewer at the Foreign Ministry showing remarked that "we all already know 
we can't live this way. What we need to know is how we should live." 
</P>
<P>
Govorukhin, a tall, balding man with a deep voice, offered no apologies for his 
downbeat views at question-and-answer sessions after the screenings. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'm a pessimist," he said. "I have no basis to think everything 
will get better quickly. There's no one in this whole country except absolute 
idiots who doesn't think tomorrow will be worse. And when people have no hope, 
and God has been taken away from them, what can you expect?" 
</P>
<P>
Govorukhin, well-known as a journalist and director of commercial films, said 
he made "This Is No Way to Live" mainly as a "letter to the Supreme Soviet." He 
wants wide distribution for the film, but he was most concerned it be seen and 
understood by the country's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet lawmakers already have had several screenings, and chances are most will 
see the film as its fame grows. Two of Moscow's biggest cinemas have also 
committed themselves to showing it. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Russian Congress saw the film earlier this week, and its 
influence has already been felt on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy from the Russian town of Saratov quoted Govorukhin from the podium on 
Wednesday, saying, "If a country is this rich and the people are this poor, 
that's a crime." 
</P>
<P>
Another deputy noted that the film "threw in our face the horrible but honest 
truth. We can understand it differently but we all agree: This is no way to 
live." 
</P>
<P>
Govorukhin said legislators told him the documentary made conservative deputies 
more conservative and radicals more radical, but in all it managed to move the 
center slightly toward more reformist views. "If that's so, then it has played 
its role," he said.

NIELSEN REPORT GETS THE PICTURE ON GENERATION GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Roseanne" was the most popular TV series in the country last season -- but not 
among people older than 55. The ABC sitcom didn't even rank among their Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"The Simpsons," on the other hand, was the favorite show among people between 
ages 18 and 24 -- but it didn't make the Top 10 among all viewers. 
</P>
<P>
That different age groups would have different TV tastes shouldn't come as a 
surprise, but during the regular TV season that fact tends to get masked by the 
weekly A. C. Nielsen report that lumps them all together to show the top 
programs among all viewers. 
</P>
<P>
When the TV season ended, however, Nielsen issued demographic breakdowns of the 
varied Top 10s. The exercise is not just academic: Most advertisers are 
interested in reaching young adult viewers because they are thought to be more 
willing to try new products and to shift brand allegiances. That's why CBS, for 
example -- which had four of the Top 10 shows among the 55-and-older crowd but 
none among those for two younger categories -- has said that its fall schedule 
will target younger audiences.

COMMUNISTS TAKE BIG LEAD IN BULGARIA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party took a strong lead in early returns after 
a surprisingly fair vote on Sunday, setting up communism's first victory in the 
new age of East European democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian television reported that with about 20% of the vote counted, the 
renamed Communist Party had 47%, compared to 34% for the opposition Union of 
Democratic Forces. 
</P>
<P>
A West German polling organization that had proved highly accurate in 
predicting the vote in East Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia gave the 
Bulgarian Socialists an even higher share, 48.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"The results are pretty consistent, which gives us confidence in their 
accuracy," said Reinhard Schlinkert of the Bonn-based INFAS research firm. 
</P>
<P>
INFAS, which was banned from conducting exit polls but set up a network for 
precinct reports, projected 32.3% for the Union of Democratic Forces, 8.7% for 
the Movement for Rights and Freedom backed by Bulgaria's 1.5-million Turkish 
minority, and 8.1% for the Agrarian Party. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout was well over 80% nationwide, reflecting the respect East Europeans 
have shown for the novelty of choosing who will lead them. 
</P>
<P>
Central Electoral Commission Chairman Jivko Stalev said that no serious 
irregularities were reported at the polling places, and U.S. and West European 
observers likewise said the voting had been a tribute to tolerance and 
fairness. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's election was one of the few cliffhangers in this year's succession 
of free votes in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Reformed Communists were trounced in East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, 
and the National Salvation Front in Romania has denied any common ground with 
the discredited party. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian opposition appeared to be rising quickly in recent weeks, and it 
was favored among the capital's 1.2 million residents, who gave more than 50% 
support to the 16-party Union of Democratic Forces. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of nearly 1,000 rallied outside election headquarters well into the wee 
hours of today, waving blue opposition banners and chanting in support of the 
political underdogs, apparently unaware their favorites were running a distant 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Vote counting progressed slowly despite the aid of computers sent by the U.S. 
government and other backers of democracy. Western diplomats monitoring the 
tabulations made little effort to hide their disappointment over the 
pro-Communist result. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgarians, saddled with $11 billion in foreign debts and a declining economy, 
may have feared the opposition's call for stepped-up reforms, opting instead 
for the relative security of the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing quite well. No big surprises," said Kalin Mitrev, a Socialist 
diplomat watching the vote projections with obvious satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Full results from the first round are expected late today, and a runoff will be 
held in a week to decide contests in which no candidate won at least 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The balloting will seat a 400-member Grand National Assembly, with half the 
deputies chosen through a party popularity contest and the other half in 
individual constituencies. Results released late Sunday were for the party 
preferences. 
</P>
<P>
International election observers said the vote apparently proceeded without 
major incidents, an element of surprise after a campaign of mudslinging and 
allegations of foul play by the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been very calm, fair and balanced," said Lyubomir Mitov, a nonpartisan 
monitor sent to the village of Jordankino from the national Committee for Fair 
Elections based in Sofia. "It's gone much smoother than we expected." 
</P>
<P>
Union of Democratic Forces leaders had accused rural supporters of the 
Socialist Party of threatening punishment of opponents in backward, isolated 
regions of Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
In villages like Razliv, an enclave of several hundred tucked between folds of 
the verdant Balkan range, Bulgarians spoke out in defense of the party that is 
the only power many of them have ever known. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already worked hard all my life, and I want to go into retirement knowing 
what the circumstances will be," said 65-year-old Maria Atanassova, a toothless 
milkmaid chuckling with other plump matrons on a sagging bench outside Razliv's 
sole cafe. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some bad things done by the party over 45 years, but there 
have also been good things as well. People won't forget that," chimed in Penka 
Petkova, dressed in mourning black. "I voted for the BSP, as did my son and 
daughter. My husband died last year, but he would have voted for them, too." 
</P>
<P>
Marin Pavlov, chairman of Razliv's Socialist Party, sat on the stoop of the 
nearby post office, smoking, trading gossip and tipping an imaginary hat to 
acquaintances trudging through oppressive heat to the polling place across the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a member of the BSP for 35 years," said Pavlov, using the initials 
for the new name taken on by the Communists in April. "The party, regardless of 
mistakes, has done a lot for the nation, and with the restructuring that is 
taking place, I believe it will be the political force to lead the country out 
of crisis." 
</P>
<P>
A cluster of cafe patrons and exiting voters, who had sidled up to listen in on 
the political chat, all nodded their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Only Ivan Vruchkovsky, a local election monitor, stood up to be counted for the 
Union of Democratic Forces. 
</P>
<P>
"In villages, especially, democracy still has not penetrated the minds of the 
people. They are still fearful," said Vruchkovsky. "The people have been 
repressed for 45 years." 
</P>
<P>
In the nearby town of Pravec, a more affluent resort and computer-manufacturing 
region about 45 miles east of Sofia, the community of 900 seemed sharply split 
but far from fractious. 
</P>
<P>
Voters en route to the polls stopped in at the Union of Democratic Forces club 
for cold drinks and lollipops for the children, while the Socialist Party 
headquarters across the courtyard blared Elvis Presley songs to entertain the 
strollers. 
</P>
<P>
Rositza Guleva and Mariana Vassileva, both 28-year-old sales clerks at the 
local department store, were asked for whom they had voted. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Communist Party failed for 45 years to achieve progress, it's time 
for someone else to try to improve the situation," said Guleva, explaining her 
preference for the Union of Democratic Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Vassileva, smiling at her friend's dissent, said the Socialists "have learned 
from the mistakes of the past" and present the best hope of avoiding chaotic 
changes in the economy.

GULF OIL SPILL FEARS GROW AS BLASTS HIT SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A series of explosions rocked the already crippled and burning tanker Mega Borg 
in the Gulf of Mexico Sunday afternoon, raising fears of an environmental 
disaster if the ship sinks with its cargo of 38 million gallons of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
The explosions damaged tanks holding some of the oil, sending a torrent of 
burning crude toward the stern of the ship and into the water. The five 
explosions occurred over a 10-minute period shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Todd Nelson said the blasts were in the aft 
portion of the ship near the area of the engine room, a part of the tanker that 
has been burning out of control since the first explosions at 1 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In that first set of explosions, two men were killed, and two others are still 
missing. Seventeen other crewmen were injured, none of them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Until the explosions Sunday afternoon, the Coast Guard had been relatively 
confident that the tanker would not sink. But the ship, which is anchored 57 
miles southeast of Galveston, Tex., listed by several degrees at the stern 
after the latest blasts, and Coast Guard Capt. Tom Greene upgraded the chance 
of a catastrophic incident from slight to moderate. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said that the tanker was "squatting quite a bit and listing to port" and 
that the burning oil was "spilling out the back of the tanker, like water would 
if you tip a glass." 
</P>
<P>
He called it fortunate that the oil was burning after it hit the water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good that it's burning because (that) removes it quickly" from the water, 
he said. "We intend to let it burn." 
</P>
<P>
The first of the explosions occurred early Saturday when the 853-foot-long 
Norwegian tanker was transferring crude oil to a smaller tanker so that the 
petroleum could be brought into the port of Houston. Flames shot high into the 
air, and the Mega Borg has been burning since.

At a news conference before the latest round of explosions, Coast Guard Lt. 
Cmdr. Frank Whipple said that salvage crews plan to keep the tanker's hull cool 
by spraying it with water and that an all-out assault on the fires will begin 
Monday. The bodies of the two dead crewmen were removed from the deck Sunday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Smit America, the Galveston salvage operator hired by the tanker owners, is 
assembling a team of firefighters, who are expected to begin their work Monday 
morning. The plan is to circle the tanker with six fireboats and send teams to 
the forward decks in a blitz against the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, several members of the Smit America salvage team went aboard 
the vessel and were able to shut several valves to the ship's tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said that, although much of the firefighting equipment was in place by 
Sunday afternoon, it would have been useless to begin the operation then 
because the most optimistic estimate of the time needed to douse the flames is 
a full day. The firefighting efforts would have had to stop Sunday when 
darkness set in. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to put foam on it and try to beat it back," Nelson said, 
explaining the plans for the Monday operation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Coast Guard's Atlantic Strike Team from Mobile, Ala., has also 
been sent in, as have other emergency groups. They have brought in, among other 
things, a 600-foot barrier boom for use if the ship sinks and the millions of 
gallons of crude oil have to be contained. 
</P>
<P>
Four Coast Guard cutters were around the tanker Sunday while two ships from 
Smit America sprayed the hull. The Mega Borg's owners have also contracted to 
have a plane spread dispersants over the estimated 7,000 gallons of crude oil 
that has been spilled so far. Nelson said that a Coast Guard plane in Houston 
is loaded with dispersants to be used in the event of a major oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Whipple said that no cause has been found for the original explosion, and 
Nelson said the dead and missing men are the ones who would know what happened. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker was loaded with oil at Palanca, Angola. It was scheduled to travel 
to the Caribbean island of Aruba after unloading the oil in Houston. The 
captain and crew were said to be either from India or the Philippines.

BASEBALL CARDS -- THIEVES GET IN ON THE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Two weeks ago, someone broke into Pop's Sports Cards and Collectibles in the 
Santa Clarita Valley and made off with $62,000 worth of baseball cards and 
other sports memorabilia. Investigators say it was the skilled work of a 
professional thief. 
</P>
<P>
At Bases Loaded, a card shop in Chatsworth, bars on the windows and burglar 
alarms didn't stop six break-ins in 12 months. About $15,000 worth of baseball 
cards from the last burglary were recovered after they had apparently been 
traded for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Collecting player picture cards has become a big-time industry, and card 
dealers and Los Angeles police say it is now breeding big-time crime. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, dealers and police report a trend in which numerous 
card dealers' shops have been broken into in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, the thefts have led to injuries. A San Diego dealer was 
attacked by a man who stole cards from his shop. And in San Luis Obispo, Frank 
Gove was found beaten to death in March behind the counter of the baseball card 
store where he worked. About $10,000 in sports cards and other memorabilia were 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that what was once a fairly innocent hobby now has a darker 
side," said Detective Mike Brennler, who is investigating the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows that better than Robert and Mike Manning, the father and son who 
operate Pop's Sports Cards and Collectibles in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago a burglar broke into a shop that the Mannings operated in nearby 
Valencia to steal coins and try to open the safe. The display cases filled with 
baseball cards were left untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, however, when a burglar broke into the new shop, the four display 
cases of baseball cards were emptied and, this time, the coins were left 
behind. Gone were the gems of the Mannings' card cases: a 1953 Willie Mays, a 
1956 Mickey Mantle and others. Many were worth hundreds of dollars each. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be, in this business, that you worried about fire or water damaging 
your stock," Mike Manning said. "Now you have to worry about the criminal 
element." 
</P>
<P>
In the old days -- which for card shops largely means the early 1980s -- many 
shops didn't even have alarms. But the recent crimes are causing changes. Now 
many shops have sophisticated alarms and other means of security. Like jewelry 
stores, some shops place the most expensive cards in safes when they close up 
for the night. 
</P>
<P>
The Mannings, who thought an alarm system was enough for their shop in Canyon 
Country, are now thinking about putting bars over the windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
"All this for baseball cards," said a dejected Robert Manning, who invested 
much of his retirement savings in cards to sell at the store. 
</P>
<P>
Other Southland dealers make similar observations. 
</P>
<P>
"People are getting ripped off; you have to take precautions," said Matt 
Federgreen, owner of the Beverly Hills Baseball Card Shop. "I protect my store 
like it's a jewelry store. I have a second alarm, video cameras and bars on my 
windows and doors." 
</P>
<P>
Federgreen said he doesn't even keep his most valuable cards inside his store 
on North Robertson Boulevard. They are in a safe deposit box and he shows them 
by appointment only. "After I get to know someone, then I will bring out my 
good stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Federgreen stressed that collectors need to be as careful as dealers these 
days. He reported that one of his 14-year-old customers recently had a 
collection valued at $10,000 stolen from his home. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball cards have become a billion-dollar business, observers say. Though 
still the domain of youngsters who collect and trade them, player picture cards 
and other sports memorabilia have also become prime investment concerns to 
collectors young and old with big bucks. A mint 1952 Mickey Mantle card can go 
for $8,000 this year, next year maybe even more. Rarer specimens have even more 
astronomical prices. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of the growth can be seen in the San Fernando Valley, where in 10 years 
the number of card shops has more than quadrupled from three to at least 14, 
said Max Himmelstein, operator since 1980 of the Valley Baseball Card Shop in 
Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the expansion and success of the market has come what dealers and 
law enforcement authorities believe is a wave of crime. 
</P>
<P>
"With the surge in prices and interest in sports memorabilia, you are going to 
get the types who will resort to criminal means to get cards," Brennler said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gorman, owner of Bases Loaded in Chatsworth, said the phenomenon is 
discouraging and irritating but possibly unavoidable because of the value of 
collector cards. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do about it," Gorman said. "I put bars on the windows and 
alarms all over the place but still they get in here." 
</P>
<P>
In the first week of April, Bases Loaded was burglarized twice in five days, 
losing $15,000 in baseball cards. Police recovered a number of the cards after 
detectives learned from an informant that the burglar had stolen them to trade 
for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Police used a warrant to search a suspected drug dealer's home and found the 
cards alongside a cache of cocaine. Detective Butch Cantalupo, who collected 
cards as a boy, called the case a telling example of how the hobby has lost 
some of its innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, baseball cards keep coming up related to crime," Cantalupo 
said. "There is a lot of value to some of these cards. They can be turned over 
and sold" easily by thieves. 
</P>
<P>
The burglar who hit Pop's Sports Cards and Collectibles on May 30 was both 
cagey and knowledgeable. Before breaking in, the thief disconnected not only 
the alarm, but the phones to all stores in the small strip shopping center. The 
burglar then smashed in the shop's glass door, clearing the display counters 
and stock shelves of more than 7,000 player cards. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew what he was looking for," Mike Manning said of the burglar. Some cards 
were taken, some were left behind. The burglar dumped one carton of baseball 
cards out so the box could be used to haul others from the shop. 
</P>
<P>
"The cards were what they wanted," Sheriff's Sgt. Dick Young said. "It looks 
like it was done by a professional. This wasn't some kids breaking in to grab 
cards." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Brennler said numerous card shops have been robbed nationwide in the 
last two to three years, but the Gove killing is apparently the only murder 
that has resulted. 
</P>
<P>
Gove was attacked as he was closing the Central Coast Baseball Cards shop. He 
was beaten with a blunt object and his body found slumped behind a counter. 
None of the stolen baseball cards or memorabilia have turned up, Brennler said. 
</P>
<P>
Such crimes are difficult to solve, detectives say. Most cards -- except 
extremely rare ones -- are hard to trace because they can't be marked by owners 
and there are usually duplicates on the market. They are also easy to sell. In 
addition to shops, sports cards are traded hand-to-hand by collectors as well 
as bought and sold at swap meets, sports memorabilia shows and through 
collector magazines and catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives investigating baseball card crimes hope for breaks and stay in touch 
with dealers, who in turn keep on the alert for stolen cards. Last week, a 
Santa Clarita Valley dealer who was aware of the break-in at Pop's Sports Cards 
called deputies to report that two young boys had just entered with a large box 
of cards to sell. Deputies rushed to the shop but the cards didn't match those 
taken during the Pop's burglary. The boys were allowed to go about their 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers are eager to cooperate because many have been victimized. Increasingly, 
the dealers work together to guard against losses as well as taking security 
measures on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be careful now," said Himmelstein, who is considered the dean of 
San Fernando Valley dealers. "There might have been a time when shops didn't 
have alarms, but it's not like that now. Anything that gets big and more 
valuable brings attention" from criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"The dealers I talk to are quite aware of the fact that there are some 
frightening episodes occurring," said Brennler. "They are taking appropriate 
precautions." 
</P>
<P>
To some like Brennler, the trend is discouraging. As a boy he avidly collected 
cards. As a detective he is investigating the bizarre extreme of the hobby, the 
slaying of a card dealer, and collects information on other baseball 
card-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
He recently helped his 9-year-old son start up his own card collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't tried to sully his hobby by telling him about all of this," Brennler 
said. "But it is a concern to me."

MENTION OF THE DEFENSE LOBBY MIGHT CALL TO MIND BOEING OR TRW. BUT SOME OF THE 
MINOR MILITARY SUPPLIERS HAVE WON MAJOR VICTORIES IN CONGRESS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a tiny defense contractor, KMS Fusion Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich., has had 
enormous success with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In each of the last five years, KMS executives have persuaded lawmakers to give 
their firm more money for fusion energy development than Administration 
budget-makers wanted. Last year, in fact, Congress spelled out KMS' $17-million 
contract -- which accounted for about two-thirds of the company's revenues -- 
in a rare line item of the fiscal 1990 Defense Authorization Act. 
</P>
<P>
One possible key to this little-known company's success: Campaign 
contributions. Since 1987, KMS' political action committee has poured $36,800 
into the campaign coffers of 13 House members closely involved with military 
spending. That sum rivals the political contributions of many far larger 
defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a computer-assisted study conducted by The Times has disclosed that 
small defense contractors like KMS are a major source of campaign contributions 
for key members of Congress who make Pentagon budget decisions -- a source of 
political money that until now has gone largely unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
The Times study has identified nearly 250 political action committees seeking 
to influence defense spending. And previous assessments, the study found, have 
vastly underestimated the amount of money that defense-oriented members of 
Congress receive from corporations that do business with the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the current 1989-90 campaign cycle, PAC reports filed with 
the Federal Election Commission show that the 65 members of the two House 
panels that shape the military budget -- the Armed Services Committee and the 
Appropriations defense subcommittee -- have received $1.7 million in 
contributions from defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
This review of defense-related PAC contributions found also that numerous 
weapons systems, such as the V-22 Osprey helicopter and the F-14D fighter jet, 
have been saved from extinction by some members of Congress who solicited 
contributions from their manufacturers -- at a time when the Administration is 
trying to slash military spending. 
</P>
<P>
Most members of Congress minimize the extent to which defense industry campaign 
contributions influence their decision-making, but House Appropriations defense 
subcommittee member Charles Wilson (D-Tex.) said that members of Congress are, 
in fact, tacitly agreeing to vote in favor of contractors from whom they accept 
campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any fair-minded person knows that, when anybody gives you $10,000 in 
PAC contributions, they're not doing it because your breath smells good," 
Wilson said. "When you actively solicit money from special interest groups, you 
are implying you support them." 
</P>
<P>
The Times study found that it is obscure companies such as KMS Fusion -- whose 
contracts are too small to attract much attention -- that seem to be most 
effective at persuading Congress to approve spending they have failed to win 
directly from the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"The smaller it is, the easier it is to lobby for. It is the $2-million 
research project that can be influenced most easily," one Armed Services 
Committee source said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress have always challenged military spending priorities -- 
sometimes because of differing tactical or strategic visions, sometimes to 
protect jobs back in their home districts, sometimes for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, however, without computers able to sift through mountains of data, 
it has been difficult to examine the flow of campaign money from individual 
contractors to the representatives and senators who are most directly involved 
in Pentagon spending decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The top 27 defense PACs alone, which contributed a record $6.8 million to all 
members of Congress for the 1988 elections, have already donated nearly $3.9 
million this time, with five months to go before the November election. Of 
that, $929,820 has gone to members of the two House defense committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Headed for a Record 
</P>
<P>
At this rate, there is little doubt that defense industry contributions to 
members of Congress will set a record. All this, critics say, could make it 
more difficult for Congress to trim the Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
The flood of defense dollars has not flowed evenly to all members, however. 
While some committee members got little from the industry, others got a lot. 
Wilson, a prominent member of the Appropriations Committee's defense 
subcommittee, pulled in $94,000 -- making him the biggest beneficiary of 
defense PAC dollars. 
</P>
<P>
And PAC dollars alone do not tell the whole story. Many members also receive 
sizable personal contributions from top defense industry executives and 
lobbyists. Wilson, again, got $17,750 in such personal contributions -- 
bringing the total defense receipts for his campaign organization since January 
of 1989 to a whopping $111,750. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, defense contractors pay key members of Congress thousands of 
dollars in honorariums. This money, unlike PAC campaign contributions, may 
largely be kept as personal income. According to records made public on May 29, 
members of the Armed Services Committee and Appropriations defense subcommittee 
got $391,611 -- or 47% of all their honorariums -- from defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson collected $12,000 in six days in Southern California last year, touring 
facilities of Aerojet-General, Rockwell, Northrop, TRW, Marquardt and Singer, 
which also paid for his air fare, lodging and meals. 
</P>
<P>
The ability of defense contractors to influence Capitol Hill is particularly 
relevant this year. While Administration officials try to cut back or kill 
programs in order to meet budget goals, the affected contractors are doling out 
thousands of campaign dollars to persuade members of Congress to preserve the 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
PAC contributions have become an integral part of modern American politics for 
obvious reasons. Members of Congress need money to support their campaigns; 
defense contractors -- like other businesses and special interests -- hasten to 
supply the money because they believe it advances their ends. 
</P>
<P>
Public criticism of this system has grown so loud, however, that both Democrats 
and Republicans in the Senate have recently put forth proposals to ban PAC 
contributions to members of Congress. There is still no real sentiment for such 
action in the House, where members are far more dependent on PACs to finance 
their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
PACs, which are quasi-independent entities set up by companies, unions and 
trade groups to make campaign contributions, were created by a post-Watergate 
law that sought to clamp down on the large contributions that corporate 
executives were making to political campaigns. Ironically, many PACs are 
supported largely by top executives. 
</P>
<P>
As for the contractors, they insist they do not demand that members of Congress 
vote their way in exchange for campaign contributions. "We don't expect them to 
vote 100% our way," said Al Spivak, Washington spokesman for General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources did admit that members of Congress who frequently vote against 
defense companies do not receive continued support from their PACs. That is why 
a military critic such as Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), a member of the 
Armed Services Committee, received only $2,526 in defense-related PAC money. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see PAC money going to members of Congress who don't need it for 
their reelection, it demonstrates all the more that the money is going to curry 
favor," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a longtime critic of 
PAC financing. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, major studies of defense contractors' PAC spending have focused 
primarily on the contributions made by 10 of the biggest manufacturers of 
military equipment: Boeing, General Dynamics, General Electric, Grumman, Hughes 
Aircraft, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, Raytheon, Rockwell and United 
Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 survey, Common Cause found that gifts from those firms' PACs to 
members of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations defense 
subcommittee had gone from $152,550 in the 1979-80 election cycle to $757,590 
during the 1985-86 cycle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big 10 Giving Is Up 
</P>
<P>
The Times' review of more recent FEC reports found that congressional campaign 
giving by those same 10 PACs has continued to escalate -- reaching $842,425 in 
the 1987-88 election cycle and amounting to $536,150 so far for this time 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, contributions from the largest contractors clearly represent only 
part of the defense-related PAC money that members of the House Armed Services 
and the Appropriations defense subcommittee receive for their reelection war 
chests. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do dozens of other big weapons producers, such as Tenneco and Martin 
Marietta, give money to members of these panels, but committee members receive 
contributions from a variety of other firms whose business is affected by the 
committee's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
These include technology and computer software firms, weapons research 
laboratories, builders of defense installations, oil companies that supply fuel 
to the military, textile factories that supply fabric for uniforms and 
cigarette and liquor manufacturers who sell their products at military bases 
under rules established by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, most of the contributions from this diverse group wind up in 
just a few campaign coffers. Of the nearly $1.7 million that defense-related 
PACs have given the 65 members of the two committees since January, 1989, 
nearly half went to just 15 members. 
</P>
<P>
These include the committee chairmen, the ranking minority party members, key 
subcommittee chairmen and a few particularly outspoken men such as Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the top three recipients of defense PAC money -- Wilson, Rep. W. 
G. (Bill) Hefner (D-N.C.) and Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) -- are not members of 
the Armed Services Committee, the preeminent panel that sets broad policy 
regarding U.S. military strategy. 
</P>
<P>
They are all members of the Appropriations defense subcommittee, the 
lesser-known panel that fine-tunes military procurement decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Hefner has received $86,250 -- or 53% of what came from PACs -- from defense 
contractors, and Murtha, the subcommittee chairman, has received in $83,350 -- 
or 54% of his PAC donations -- from them. 
</P>
<P>
Other top recipients of defense-related PAC money include: Rep. Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who got $65,150 -- 40% of 
his PAC money -- from these groups; Rep. William L. (Bill) Dickinson (R-Ala.), 
the top GOP member of Armed Services, who got $61,000, or 78%, from 
defense-related PACs, and Rep. Joseph M. McDade (R-Pa.), top Republican on the 
Appropriations defense subcommittee, who got $53,250, or 56%. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin is relatively new to this elite club. In his early years on the Armed 
Services Committee, he was known as a Pentagon watchdog who made a big issue of 
military waste. Only after he became committee chairman and shed his gadfly 
image did he begin to receive large PAC contributions from contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The five other top recipients have long had reputations as pork-barrel 
politicians with close ties to the defense industry. Both Dickinson and McDade 
are subjects of House Ethics Committee investigations into allegations of 
receiving improper donations from military contractors in their home districts. 
</P>
<P>
However, of the top six recipients of defense industry PAC money, only 
Dickinson is believed to have serious opposition in next November's election. 
The others are simply padding their campaign war chests, as incumbents 
frequently do, to discourage anyone challenging them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest contributors are the large contractors, some of whose programs have 
been marked for extinction by the Administration. These include McDonnell 
Douglas, with $76,250 in contributions to members of the two defense-related 
House committees during the 1989-90 election cycle; General Dynamics, $63,550; 
Raytheon, $58,550; Lockheed, $62,550; Hughes Aircraft, $67,500; Grumman, 
$60,250; Textron, $56,300, and Northrop, $54,900. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Generous Gifts 
</P>
<P>
Although some contractors never give more than $1,000 or $2,000 to any member 
of Congress, others are far more generous. Wilson, for instance, received sums 
of $5,000 from five different contractors, $4,500 from another and $4,000 from 
three others. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, members of Congress solicit contributions by inviting people to 
fund-raising receptions. Invitations are sent not only to PAC representatives 
but also to corporate officers, lobbyists and the law firms that represent 
defense firms in Washington. That is how the contributions come to be from 
individuals as well as from PACs. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wilson received the most money from defense contractor PACs, for 
instance, Murtha surpassed him in total defense industry dollars received 
because he also took in $31,850 from individuals working with contractors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, these individual contributions have become so commonplace in the 
industry that one small contractor, Diagnostic/Retrieval Systems Inc. of 
Oakland, N.J., which manufactures naval communications equipment, has no PAC 
but relies entirely on its top corporate officers to give money directly to 
members of Congress. So far this year, Diagnostic/Retrieval's two top officers 
and their wives have given $18,800 to members of the two committees. 
</P>
<P>
Individual contributions to Rep. Ike Skelton (D-Mo.), which totaled $20,550, 
demonstrate how contractors frequently are called on to make both PAC and 
individual contributions to a single member of Congress. Although Skelton 
received PAC contributions of only $1,500 from General Dynamics and $5,500 from 
McDonnell Douglas, both of which are headquartered in his home state, he got 
$15,500 in individual contributions from officers and lobbyists for the two 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
When PAC and individual donations are added together, it becomes clear that 
industry executives can be a primary source of election funds for many members 
of these two committees. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Rep. C. W. (Bill) Young (R-Fla.), a member of the 
Appropriations defense subcommittee currently sitting on a $320,564 war chest 
although he has no announced opposition in November. Young has raised $74,335 
from PACs so far in this election cycle -- $41,250 of it from defense-related 
PACs. And all of his $4,725 in individual contributions came from 11 Washington 
lobbyists, six of whom represent military contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Few members of these committees would be interviewed on the subject of PAC 
contributions, and most who did comment insisted that the money does not 
influence their votes. Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Wash.), a member of the 
Appropriations defense subcommittee, said that the members' decisions on 
weapons systems are based primarily on ideological and parochial 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson, whose reputation for outspokenness is legend on Capitol Hill, said 
that contractors' PACs give more money to the members of the Appropriations 
defense subcommittee and Armed Services Committee because these members 
actively solicit contributions from the industry. 
</P>
<P>
With each solicitation, Wilson added, there is an implicit commitment on the 
part of the congressman to support the giver's program. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that you announce your candidacy and these people come running to you 
because of your splendid record of public service -- well, if you believe that, 
you ought to talk to somebody about buying a bridge," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go out and aggressively solicit Jewish money, it's clearly implicit 
that you're going to support Israel. If you vigorously solicit money from wheat 
farmers, it's implied you're going to support wheat subsidies. And it's the 
same with defense contractors. People who say differently are not telling it 
like it is." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the biggest contractors dominate this system, it is usually the 
smaller contractors who benefit most from making generous PAC contributions, 
committee sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sometimes on the very obscure program where members may be influenced by 
a PAC contribution," said a member of the Appropriations defense subcommittee 
who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Such a project may have been KMS Fusion's research contract with the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Administration requested $15.3 million for KMS Fusion, which, 
since the early 1970s, has been involved in laboratory research toward 
developing fusion energy. Bush Administration officials strongly opposed 
increasing the KMS appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusually blunt letter to Aspin last June, Troy Wade, then acting 
assistant secretary for defense programs at the Energy Department, said that 
KMS should get no additional funds because its "performance during the past two 
years has not met program expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such pleas, however, members of the Armed Services Committee -- 13 of 
whom have received campaign contributions from the KMS PAC since 1987 -- voted 
to give the company an additional $2.5 million in the current fiscal year. Rep. 
Robert W. Davis (D-Mich.) led the fight to give the company more money. He has 
received $6,000 in campaign contributions from KMS since 1987. In addition, KMS 
paid him $2,000 in honorariums and gave him a trip from Washington to Michigan 
and back last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extraordinary Focus 
</P>
<P>
What made the decision to increase KMS' allocation even more extraordinary was 
that the Armed Services Committee spent perhaps half an hour debating the 
matter -- more time that it devoted to many multibillion-dollar weapons 
systems. It was so unusual that Dickinson at one point remarked: "I don't know 
when I have had more interest raised in a small (increase) than this." 
</P>
<P>
KMS' generosity with campaign contributions and honorariums has helped to 
obtain committee support for the company, particularly among members who do not 
represent Michigan, according to Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (D-S.C.), who is 
chairman of the Armed Services energy subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, KMS has a long history of political activism in Washington. Its 
founder, Kelve M. Siegel, collapsed and died when testifying before Congress in 
1975. Company officers routinely contribute $250 every quarter to the KMS 
Fusion PAC, creating a generous war chest from which to distribute campaign 
contributions. In addition, the firm paid out $5,000 in honorariums last year 
and financed trips for both Davis and Rep. James V. Hansen (R-Utah). 
</P>
<P>
KMS officers would not discuss their political activities. Terence C. Liddy, 
senior vice president responsible for the corporation's PAC activities, refused 
to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Big contractors also get some benefit from their PAC contributions, but the 
system works in a different way for them. 
</P>
<P>
"PAC contributions gain the (big) contributor access," Spratt said. "A 
contributor gets his telephone calls returned, he gets an office visit with the 
congressman and he gets serious consideration. In that sense, it has an impact. 
Usually, they've got a case to make. You know it's biased, but it's information 
you would not get out of the Department of Defense." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just One of Tools 
</P>
<P>
But, in most cases, PAC contributions are just one of the leverage tools that 
the largest contractors use when they set out to persuade members of Congress 
to save a program marked for cuts or extinction by the Administration. They 
also rely heavily on lobbying by the congressmen who represent the districts 
where the economic impact will be felt. 
</P>
<P>
An example of how that system works occurred last year, during consideration of 
the future of the M-1 tank, currently manufacturered by General Dynamics at 
plants in Ohio and Michigan. The Administration's reduced budget request for 
M-1 tanks would have required General Dynamics to shut down its plant outside 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the congressman who led the battle to let General Dynamics 
keep the Michigan plant open was Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), powerful 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Although Dingell does not serve 
on the defense-related committee, he prevailed on members of the Appropriations 
defense subcommittee to save the Michigan plant. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics, meanwhile, gave PAC contributions of $5,000 to the top two 
members of the panel, Murtha and McDade. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriations subcommittee Chairman Murtha had made up his mind by the time he 
opened hearings on the matter in March, 1989. He told Army officials: "We are 
not going to close this plant down if there is a chance we will need it down 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
His decision was ratified by the Armed Services Committee, which specifically 
ruled out shutting down the Michigan plant in the 1990 Defense Authorization 
Act. Forty-four Armed Services Committee members have received contributions 
ranging from $250 to $4,500 from General Dynamics during the current election 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Murtha was unavailable to comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to congressional sources, PAC donations also played a role -- 
although a lesser one -- last year in the more visible battles over weaponry 
such as the V-22 Osprey and the F-14D aircraft. Although the Administration 
proposed ending both programs, Congress agreed to a compromise whereby both 
would continue to receive some funds for another year. 
</P>
<P>
The F-14 is manufactured by Grumman on Long Island, N.Y.; the V-22 is a joint 
project of Bell Helicopter Textron in Texas and Boeing Helicopter in 
Pennsylvania. Although these projects had strong support within the Long 
Island, Pennsylvania and Texas delegations, the three companies did not rely 
entirely on parochial concerns to carry the day. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Textron's PAC has contributed $657,556 to all members of Congress; 
Grumman, $439,725, and Boeing, $494,217. Rep. George J. Hochbrueckner (D-N.Y.), 
who led the fight on behalf of the F-14 because it is produced in his district, 
received $4,000 from Grumman toward his 1990 election. He also got $5,000 from 
the Machinists Union, which represents workers at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did all the contributions go to allies of these contractors. Quite 
frequently, PAC money goes to the opponents of the endangered program as well 
as to the supporters. In that way, contractors hope to persuade members of 
Congress to change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson, who led the opposition to the V-22 and the F-14, received $5,000 
from Grumman and $2,000 from Textron a few days before the House was scheduled 
to vote on the matter. He later abandoned his effort to eliminate funds for the 
two weapons, saying the programs were simply too popular in the House. 
Dickinson was unavailable to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Textron gave him a further $3,000 two months later. 
</P>

AMOS OWEN; AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGIOUS LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amos Owen, 73, a Dakota Sioux leader who helped to renew traditional Native 
American Indian religious practices. 
</P>
<P>
Severely wounded while serving with the U.S. Army in the Philippines in World 
War II, Owen returned to study traditional Indian beliefs from Sioux medicine 
men in South Dakota. Many people considered him a medicine man or priest, but 
he preferred the term "pipe carrier," meaning the one in charge of the peace 
pipe used in Indian rituals. On June 4 on Prairie Island Indian Reservation 
near Red Wing, Minn.

FOOTNOTES: NOW THAT'S A JUNK BOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharon Pereida wants you to give her $3 now for a bond she says will be worth 
$5 in 10 years. Five dollars worth of junk, specifically, at Pereida's 
used-merchandise store called What's New? in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Right; it's a junk bond. 
</P>
<P>
Pereida, who has run What's New? since 1988, is issuing sort-of-real-looking, 
numbered certificates emblazoned with the words Junk Bond. The small type on 
the certificates states that the buyer who plunks down $3 now may redeem the 
bond at maturity, April 1, 2000, or thereafter, for "$5 worth of junk" at 
What's New. 
</P>
<P>
And just to be official about it, the bonds also state that "the bearer has no 
rights whatsoever to the assets of What's New in case of default." Which is 
about the same deal a lot of real junk bond holders have gotten. 
</P>
<P>
Pereida, 43, says she has sold 25 of the bonds so far, mostly to friends. She 
figures she can sell a lot more without any worry about meeting her bond 
obligations in the year 2000. "I've got junk merchandise to last at least that 
long," she says. "And remember, junk is in the eye of the beholder." 
</P>
<P>
She sounds like a lot of investment bankers we used to know. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Paisano Publications has pulled the plug on Woman's Enterprise, a 2-year-old 
magazine targeted to entrepreneurial women. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura Hills company is trying to find a buyer for the magazine, which it 
said is "showing promise and some profits." 
</P>
<P>
The reason? "Our other six publications are totally male-oriented, and the 
decision has been made that we should concentrate our efforts in that 
marketplace," said Joe Teresi, Paisano president. 
</P>
<P>
"Male-oriented" might be understating it a bit; the company's other 
publications include Easy Riders, Biker Lifestyles and Tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
Woman's Enterprise was an attempt at diversification that was begun at the same 
time as the hot-rod publication American Rodder. 
</P>
<P>
"But we found we were better in the automotive field than the woman's," said 
Paisano's Brian Wood. 
</P>
<P>

The Skinniest Place on Earth 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland is about as American as burgers and hot dogs. And as is everybody 
else in this health-conscious country, the Magic Kingdom is trying to slim 
down: It has added a turkey burger to its menu. 
</P>
<P>
The Puppeteer Burger -- made with ground turkey rather than ground beef -- went 
on sale last week at the Village Haus snack stand in Fantasyland. The new 
burger is being offered on a trial basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we would like to offer people a healthier alternative," said 
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth. "The hope is that this will be there for quite a 
while. If (the trial) goes well, it will stay." 
</P>
<P>
The turkey burger will join other lower-fat foods offered by the snack stand: 
chicken strips and salads. Mickey Mouse, of course, prefers his turkey burger 
with cheese. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Role for Rock 
</P>
<P>
Climbing the corporate ladder could be an easy feat next to this. 
</P>
<P>
J&amp;B on the Rocks is a national tour bringing a 30-foot, 10-ton "climbing 
structure" to business centers nationwide so that executives can climb a rock 
for charity. 
</P>
<P>
This man-made mountain will be at the Wells Fargo Plaza, 444 S. Flower St., in 
downtown Los Angeles from noon to 6 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Scotch whiskey maker will donate $1 for every foot climbed to American 
Oceans Campaign, a Santa Monica-based environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
And, just to be on the safe side, the U.S. Climbing Team will be on hand to 
guide novices up the structure.

TANKER MISHAPS ROCKET, DESPITE FOCUS ON SAFETY; 
</P>
<P>
SHIPPING: THE RATE OF INCREASE IN ACCIDENTS IS OUTSTRIPPING THE RATE OF TANKERS 
BEING ADDED TO THE WORLD FLEET. 
</P>

Talk about bad timing. 
</P>
<P>
As oil company officials gathered in Monterey for an industry conference on 
tanker shipping over the weekend, tanker spills were all over the headlines: 
</P>
<P>
* In the Gulf of Mexico Saturday, the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg, carrying 38 
million gallons of crude, exploded spectacularly and caught fire, killing crew 
members and disgorging a massive oil spill. More explosions rocked the tanker 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* Just two days earlier, the British tanker BT Nautilus ran aground in the 
waterway between New York and New Jersey, dumping more than 260,000 gallons of 
home heating oil -- the fifth oil spill in the waterway this year. 
</P>
<P>
The spills occurred despite the fact that the industry is paying greater 
attention to shipping safety in the wake of the nation's worst spill, the Exxon 
Valdez accident off Alaska last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They are almost terrified with what can happen with an oil spill in the U.S., 
and that's good," said Arthur McKenzie, director of the Tanker Advisory Center 
in New York and a former Exxon shipping executive. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry officials argue that the pace of accidents is no worse than in 
the past. "I would have to say that (the number of the weekend's accidents) is 
more likely coincidence than an indication of any increased frequency of tanker 
incidents," said Richard Golob, president of World Information Systems in 
Cambridge, Mass., which monitors oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Gulf and New York accidents -- and a mishap between a 
freighter and a transport ship off the coast of China before dawn Friday -- are 
certain to focus new attention on the safety of shipping oil over water. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie reported that the number of tanker accidents, from minor collisions to 
sinkings, increased 17.1% to 528 in 1989 from 451 in 1986, after dipping to 408 
in 1987. In the first quarter of 1990, there have been 156 accidents alone, an 
annual pace of more than 600, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The rate of accidents has jumped faster than the rate of tankers being added to 
the world fleet, which went up 5.5% to 3,305 at the beginning of this year from 
a low of 3,132 in 1987, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials were loath to generalize about possible safety problems. But 
a shipping executive with a major oil company was alarmed by the grounding in 
New York harbor, which occurred while a pilot was on board. "I'm sure it 
doesn't suggest that they don't know what they're doing, but it does make you 
wonder a little about the qualification of pilots," said the executive, who 
asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the standards of education and training throughout the merchant marine 
have probably suffered a bit," he added. He blamed smaller crews, budget cuts 
at regulatory and enforcement agencies such as the Coast Guard and less 
rigorous licensing and testing. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulf accident, which occurred during a "lightering" operation, raised 
questions about the safety of lightering, the common practice of transferring 
oil from a large vessel to a smaller one. The practice is increasing in Gulf 
waters, raising the chance of collisions, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, U.S. oil company executives said Sunday that they were paying 
more attention to tanker safety. Many companies have toughened controls on 
alcohol and drugs on board. 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Atlantic Richfield, have stepped up the frequency of training for 
bridge crews, focusing on team training. Still others are making tougher 
demands of foreign vessels they charter, such as requiring inspections before 
sailing or prohibiting alcohol on board. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most oil companies have raised their oil pollution insurance 
coverage on tankers from between $400 million and $500 million to as high as 
$800 million, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. companies are making increased efforts, industry officials say 
they have little control over hazards presented by foreign-flag operators. The 
need for imported oil has forced the industry to rely more heavily on shipping 
by smaller operators, and many have lower standards for training and tanker 
maintenance, according to Jerry Aspland, president of Arco Marine. 
</P>
<P>
Tankers flagged from industrialized or European nations with high training and 
maintenance standards may carry crews from countries that do not have such 
standards, Aspland added. The tanker burning in the Gulf of Mexico, for 
example, carries a Norwegian flag, but a Philippine and Indian crew. 
</P>
<P>
Other executives said it is unfair to stigmatize Third World crews, and argued 
that a flag from a European nation is no guarantee of safety.

Management Hiring Trend to Continue: A national survey found that more than 
one-third of the executives responsible for hiring middle management and 
professional staffs plan staff increases in the second half of 1990, continuing 
a trend of recent years. Management Recruiters International, a management 
recruitment firm, said that of the more than 3,600 executives polled, 35.1% 
planned to increase their middle management and professional staffs the last 
six months of the year, 50.9% planned to maintain current staff sizes and 13.8% 
expect to reduce staff.

DREXEL PREPARES FOR ITS WALL STREET GARAGE SALE;

Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment house built on junk bonds and destroyed 
by charges of fraud, put the furniture up for sale Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands lined up for more than an hour to walk through Drexel's headquarters 
at 60 Broad St., just four doors away from the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On view were more than 1,500 lots of merchandise to be auctioned Wednesday in 
New York's biggest convention hall. 
</P>
<P>
The items ranged from an 83-foot trading desk designed to seat 37 people (Lot 
1416) to a blown-up photograph of I. W. (Tubby) Burnham II, founder and 
honorary chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group (Lot 2452). 
</P>
<P>
The auction is one of the final ignominious steps in Drexel's collapse. It 
became one of the biggest and most powerful investment houses on Wall Street in 
the freewheeling 1980s, mostly through the innovative use of high-yield junk 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's star, Michael Milken, turned the bonds -- traditionally shunned by the 
blue bloods of Wall Street -- into a multibillion-dollar market. 
</P>
<P>
But Milken and Drexel ran into the government's massive investigation of 
illegal insider trading on Wall Street. The firm's legal problems eventually 
led to a cash crisis. It filed for bankruptcy protection in February and began 
winding up its operations. 
</P>
<P>
Some who stood in line an hour at Drexel's headquarters were there just to see 
what it looked like. "It's a sad day," one said. 
</P>
<P>
But most appeared to be serious bidders. They included furniture and restaurant 
supply wholesalers and small entrepreneurs looking to pick up a computer for 
their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the merchandise for sale was office furniture. It ranged from austere 
gray metal or wood desks to only slightly more elegant trappings for top 
executives. Drexel was never a firm for opulence and its offices reflected 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Personal papers had long since been cleared out, but the offices still bore 
marks of their inhabitants. One desk drawer contained packages of Pepto-Bismol 
tablets and throat lozenges. At the main reception desk was a family snapshot 
and an envelope containing the final week's time cards. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the attention was focused on the ninth floor, where equities and bond 
traders had labored for long hours to make money through rapid-fire dealings in 
stocks, bonds and foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Stacked above the trading stations were hundreds of computer terminals from 
IBM, Sun Microsystems, Memorex and others. Above it all flashed an electronic 
billboard: "Welcome to Drexel Burnham Lambert's Block Trading Desk." 
</P>
<P>
Handling the auction is Ross-Dove Co., which promises that it will get through 
the 1,500 lots in one day.

American Flight Attendants Settle Suit: American Airlines and its flight 
attendants have agreed to settle lawsuits stemming from the carrier's decision 
to place foreign attendants on its Latin American routes, a union official 
said. The company will hire about 200 foreign nationals as attendants on Latin 
American routes acquired from Eastern Airlines and use more domestic attendants 
on flights departing from its Miami hub to destinations in Central and South 
America, according to Cheryle Leon, president of the Assn. of Professional 
Flight Attendants. An American Airlines spokeswoman could not confirm details 
of the agreement.

Rockwell Sued by Former Executive: A suit was filed Thursday against Rockwell 
International Corp. by the former president of its Advanced Systems for 
Strategic Defense &amp; Technology division. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court case, filed by Seymour Z. Rubenstein, claims 
that he was fired in 1989 because of discrimination based on a physical 
handicap. Rubenstein, who worked for Rockwell 28 years, seeks unstated damages 
plus punitives because he allegedly was dismissed for falling asleep or being 
late for meetings. He says he suffered from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

DEALS: HAS DISNEY GOT A DEAL FOR DOPEY, GOOFY AND DUMBO! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're looking for a real Mickey Mouse security, all you have to do is look 
at the new piece of paper that Walt Disney Co. wants you to buy. 
</P>
<P>
The security is what's known on Wall Street as a LYON, for Liquid Yield Option 
Note. It's probably more accurate to call it a Grossly Overpriced Overly Frugal 
Yielding note, or GOOFY. Which is what you will be if you buy it without 
understanding what you're buying. 
</P>
<P>
The LYON, which is undoubtedly selling like Cokes in Disneyland on a hot day -- 
how many prospectuses open with a full-color picture of Mickey and friends? -- 
is a magical piece of paper. Magical for Disney, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is a guaranteed winner, thanks to the tax code, and the U.S. Treasury is 
a guaranteed loser. The investors who buy the security? They may make out if 
they can duck the daffy tax problems that LYON holders have. And if the dollar 
drops compared to the French franc. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch has guaranteed to sell $1.5 billion in face value of Disney 
LYONs. Because they sell at a steep discount from face, the LYONs would raise 
about $600 million for Disney. Given the demand for this stuff, which is being 
sold heavily to individual investors who have grown up ingesting Disney with 
their mother's milk, the LYON may well roar up to $2.5 billion, which would 
raise about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Why the difference between the LYONs' face value and the money they raise for 
Disney? Because LYONs are like old-style U.S. savings bonds. Remember? You paid 
$18.75 for a bond with a $25 face value, and you got your $25 when the bond 
matured. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming this deal, scheduled for later this month, goes off as planned, you 
will pay $411.99 for a Disney LYON with a face value of $1,000 that matures in 
15 years. The difference between that $411.99 and $1,000 is interest, at 6% a 
year, compounded semiannually. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the interest payments are deductible to corporations such as 
Disney. Thus, if $1.5 billion of LYONs are sold and stay outstanding until 
maturity, Disney will get about $880 million in tax deductions over 15 years. 
If $2.5 billion in LYONs are sold, the deductions would be around $1.47 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Now, we enter tax fantasyland. Even though Disney won't actually shell out cash 
interest for years, it gets interest deductions beginning the day it sells the 
paper. Deduct now, pay later. Pretty slick, isn't it? And perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
But just as Disney gets tax deductions for interest it hasn't paid, LYON owners 
get whacked for income tax for interest they haven't received. So the only 
sensible way to buy this security -- if it's sensible to buy it -- is in an 
individual retirement account or for the account of someone who pays no income 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, no one, no matter how dopey, will lend Disney money for 15 years at 
6%. Not when 15-year Treasury securities yield about 8.5% and top-rated 15-year 
corporate bonds yield around 10%. So Disney is offering a sweetener -- which is 
where the bet against the dollar comes in. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is offering "contingent interest" based on the share price of Euro 
Disney, a French company. You get either the contingent interest or 6%, 
whichever is higher. If Euro Disney does well, so will you. 
</P>
<P>
Just how well Euro Disney must do is another question. Euro Disney, whose 
shares trade on the Paris Bourse, is building a Disney theme park in France. 
Its shares, naturally, are quoted in French francs. Euro Disney has a 
mind-blowing market value of $3 billion even though the park isn't even built 
and is considered by many people to be one of the most overpriced securities on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
If you do the math, you see that for you to make 10% interest on a 15-year 
LYON, already pricey Euro Disney shares have to be worth five times as much in 
dollars in the year 2005 as they are now. Can that happen unless the dollar 
falls sharply relative to the franc? Or, for that matter, even if it does? And 
remember that 10% is no bonanza. You can get that by buying a boring old 
high-grade corporate bond. 
</P>
<P>
Note that Disney will pay you in cash, not in Euro Disney shares. As Bob 
Willens, the resident tax genius at Shearson Lehman Hutton, points out, if 
Disney LYONs were convertible into Euro Disney shares, it would limit the 
interest that Disney could deduct. This way, all the interest is deductible. 
"Some very smart tax people helped set this up," Willens says. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everything here is stacked in favor of Disney and against anyone who 
owns a LYON. One good thing is that if Euro Disney's price crumbles -- which 
wouldn't exactly shock me -- you can get out of your LYON alive. Disney will 
buy the LYON from you for $553.68 in June, 1995, or for $744.10 in June, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
But the price of protection on the downside is a ceiling on how much you can 
make on the upside. If the price of Euro Disney gets high enough to make Disney 
uncomfortable, it can call the LYONs in for redemption and limit your profit. 
If Euro Disney doesn't go up much or falls, Disney sits there with your cheap 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
Disney, of course, will win no matter what happens. Disney paid only $132 
million for its 83 million Euro Disney shares, which now have a market value of 
more than $1.5 billion. If Euro Disney heads for the moon, Disney can sell some 
shares to raise cash to pay LYON interest and still be billions ahead. 
</P>
<P>
This is a great, even a brilliant, deal for Disney, which gets tax breaks, 
cheap money and a chance to cash in on its Euro Disney stock without selling 
it. For the average person, though, this LYON could be the meanest thing that 
Disney has done since killing off Bambi's mother.

MARKET BEAT: WHITTAKER LOOKS AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whittaker Corp. chief Joseph Alibrandi made a lot of money for his shareholders 
in the late 1980s when he began dismantling the former mini-conglomerate. Now, 
the 61-year-old Alibrandi is focusing on Whittaker's next phase -- as a much 
smaller firm but a very profitable one, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Whittaker's stock closed last week at $11 a share, up from 
$10.625 the previous week, despite the broad market's selloff. Since Jan. 1, 
the stock has risen 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Investor interest in the stock picked up again last week after the firm 
reported earnings for the quarter ended April 30. Though Whittaker, now an 
aerospace and biotechnology company, reported a loss from continuing operations 
of 40 cents a share, that represents the last of its transition quarters, after 
its June, 1989, recapitalization. Under Alibrandi, Whittaker borrowed heavily 
to pay out a $40-a-share dividend. To repay the debt, Alibrandi has sold pieces 
of Whittaker, continuing a 1986 divestiture plan. The big piece sold this year: 
specialty chemicals, to Morton International for $220 million. 
</P>
<P>
Alibrandi said the divestiture plan is "essentially done" and he's now focused 
on running the firm -- and hunting for acquisitions in Whittaker's two core 
areas. The company should return to profitability this quarter, thanks to a big 
drop in interest expenses and continuing healthy sales growth in its two lines: 
</P>
<P>
* In aerospace, Whittaker is a leading producer of controls, radar systems and 
cable for commercial and military jets. Although Alibrandi admits that defense 
cuts will affect Whittaker, "defense is a smaller and smaller part for us" in 
key businesses such as controls, he said. Excluding one-time charges, aerospace 
operating profit rose 11% in the latest quarter; revenue rose 13%. 
</P>
<P>
* In biotech, Whittaker makes diagnostic kits for blood testing, living tissue 
cultures and tissue-growing solutions. Operating profits were up 10% in the 
latest quarter on a 12% revenue rise. "We see tremendous opportunity here," 
Alibrandi said. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1991 (beginning next Nov. 1), some analysts have estimated that 
Whittaker could earn about $1.50 a share on revenue of $220 million. If that's 
accurate, Whittaker stock, at $11 now, is selling for just seven times 1991 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of institutional investors own big chunks of Whittaker's shares, 
leaving relatively little free to trade. One of those owners is Michael Price, 
who runs Heine Securities in Short Hills, N.J. Heine had about 600,000 of 
Whittaker's 8.3 million shares at March 31. Price's discipline is searching for 
strong companies that generate healthy cash flow, and Whittaker fits that bill, 
he said. "We think the stock is worth $15," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alibrandi, who himself owns 10% of Whittaker's shares, says he's "aiming to 
prove Price is too low" in his estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Retail Sell Signal? It had been a great spring for retailers' stocks -- until 
last week. May sales reports came in disappointing, partly because of cold 
weather across much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing stock selloff was brutal for a few retailers in particular. Few 
were hit harder than Gap Inc., which plunged 15.3% for the week to $56.125. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Tashjian, retail analyst for Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles, 
says he told clients to take profits in Gap on June 1. Gap had an aggressive 
sales plan for the first half of the year, Tashjian says, but the May cold snap 
meant low sales of Gap shorts and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though "we are getting some good signals on early June sales, they're not 
at a pace to make up for the shortfall" at Gap, Tashjian said. Translation: Big 
markdowns are coming. 
</P>
<P>
But Tashjian still sees Gap earning $3.60 a share this year. That gives the 
stock a price-to-earnings multiple of about 15 now, which is about the market 
average. Tashjian figures that makes the stock a buy for anyone with a 
long-term perspective. This isn't the first time Gap has stumbled, but its 
managers are some of the savviest in the business -- they just can't predict 
the weather. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the retail spectrum, L.A.-based Carter Hawley Hale 
(Broadway, Weinstock's, Emporium) saw its stock jump 20% for the week, to 
$6.625. It wasn't Carter Hawley's May sales report that did it, because sales 
were lousy. Instead, analyst Edward Weller at Montgomery Securities said a 
rumor was going around that the firm wants to sell its Thalhimers department 
stores in the East. Carter Hawley wouldn't comment. In any case, analysts warn 
that this debt-heavy company remains a stock for speculators only, because it's 
still bleeding red ink.

WALL STREET'S LATEST CHALLENGE: WINNING OVER BABY BOOMERS; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTING: BROKERAGES HOPE TO LURE THEM AS THEY NEAR THEIR PRIME INVESTING 
YEARS. BUT IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT TO KEEP THIS SOPHISTICATED GROUP HAPPY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Aging baby boomers, entering their prime savings and investing years, are hot 
potential prospects for every hungry stockbroker. But a nagging question dogs 
Wall Street: Do brokerages understand how to make clients out of this now 
26-to-44 age group? 
</P>
<P>
As investors, baby boomers are likely to be the same tough customers that 
they've been in other markets. They're independent, they want high-quality 
goods, and over time they'll probably be far more critical than their parents 
in evaluating services they buy. 
</P>
<P>
Those traits suggest that it will cost brokers more effort and expense to serve 
the boomer crowd -- at a time when brokerage industry profits overall are being 
squeezed by other forces. 
</P>
<P>
In the boomers, "we're dealing with the most sophisticated consumer we've ever 
had to deal with," admits James Higgins, president of Dean Witter Reynolds' 
financial services group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the challenges, virtually every major brokerage is spending a lot of 
time trying to figure out how to nab the boomers. The numbers tell the story: 
</P>
<P>
* As the first boomers enter the 45-and-over age group this year, they will 
start a cycle expected to result in meteoric growth of savings and investment. 
People age 45 to 54 traditionally are big savers, because those are the prime 
earnings years. That age group will grow about 12% a year for the first five 
years of the 1990s, and 23% for the latter five. That will be five to 10 times 
the growth rate for the U.S. population overall. 
</P>
<P>
* While some experts have questioned whether consumption-happy baby boomers -- 
who up to now have been so directed toward instant gratification -- will ever 
save money the way their parents did, the boomers' intentions seem clear. A 
survey of 400 affluent investors last year, done for the investment firm John 
Nuveen &amp; Co., showed that 45% of those in the 35-to-54 age group say they 
will be investing more over the next five years, and only 9% will be investing 
less. In contrast, only 20% of those over 55 expect to be saving more than they 
do now. 
</P>
<P>
Who's going to get the boomers' dollars? There's more competition than ever 
before. To name a few: banks, credit unions, insurance companies, mutual funds 
and, of course, brokerages. And increasingly, what each of them wants is not 
just to sell a few products to boomers but to strike up personal money 
management relationships with these young investors -- via a salesperson. That 
person, then, will be the rake that pulls in more money from the boomer 
investors as they age. 
</P>
<P>
In Wall Street parlance, this is called "asset gathering." To financial 
services companies, offering management of funds rather than just 
take-it-or-leave-it products guarantees a steady stream of income, because 
clients are charged annual fees (usually 1% to 3% of assets managed) besides 
any up-front sales charges. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, "People who have funds managed are likely to stay twice as long 
with a firm as someone who just buys some shares of stock," says Perrin Long, 
veteran brokerage industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Services in New York. 
And boomer investment trends so far suggest they'd much rather have their money 
managed than go through the trouble of picking individual stocks. Witness the 
continuing boom in stock and bond mutual fund sales. 
</P>
<P>
The tough road for brokerage firms is that relatively few baby boomers now view 
a broker as a "primary financial adviser." The Nuveen survey, for example, 
studied people who already invest. In that group, nearly half of those 55 and 
older said they consider a broker to be their primary adviser. But of those 35 
to 54, only 33% said a broker is their primary adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Can brokers successfully sell boomers the image of a trustworthy financial 
consultant? John Steffens, the respected head of consumer markets for Merrill 
Lynch &amp; Co., suggests that the formula isn't so difficult. "That's how our 
whole training program has gone," Steffens says. "We changed the term from 
'broker' to 'financial consultant' four to five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Merrill claims to already have its hooks into many baby boomers via individual 
retirement accounts and corporate 401(k) retirement savings plans. The firm 
says it holds 2 million IRAs, worth $42 billion. "We're the leader," Steffens 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the strategy of Dean Witter parent Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. is to 
deliver up investment clients from Sears' other far-flung financial operations 
-- from the Discover credit card to Allstate insurance. "We want to establish a 
client relationship well before the person's peak earnings years," said Dean 
Witter's Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
Get them early, and as the boomers begin saving more, other needs will surface 
automatically, Steffens notes: tax problems, insurance, financing children's 
education and general investing. The "financial consultant's" goal is to gather 
more assets from the client at each stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part of it all is thinking long-term -- from the client's 
viewpoint and from the salesperson's viewpoint," Steffens says. 
</P>
<P>
But there's another problem with brokers as financial consultants: Can a broker 
be objective about where to put the client's money when the broker most likely 
earns more from selling his own firm's products (such as in-house mutual funds) 
than from selling outside products? 
</P>
<P>
"There are some conflicts in the public mind," Steffens admits. "But the world 
is full of conflicts. It's how you manage it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as a free lunch," he adds, asking rhetorically, "What 
is an (independent) financial planner telling you to do?" The only issue should 
be "how you create your long-term financial success," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other brokerages, however, still believe that the role of their salespeople 
should be only that: sales. Brokers at the national firm of A. G. Edwards &amp; 
Sons, for example, have no in-house mutual funds or other products to sell. 
Their job is strictly to sell clients what they want -- not to gather assets, 
which Edwards sees as a high-cost process to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Where the majority of baby boom investors will fall on that issue remains to be 
seen. But brokerages aren't the only firms betting that millions of boomers 
will be willing to pay to have their money managed. 
</P>
<P>
* Chase Manhattan Bank is launching a service to direct clients who have at 
least $100,000 to money managers who fit the clients' needs. Chase will take a 
cut of the management fees for its trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Many banks are broadening the scope of their trust departments, and as federal 
restrictions disappear, the banks may increasingly invade the brokers' turf. 
</P>
<P>
* Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund kingpin, is just now ramping up a 
"Personal Advisory Service." For a $100,000 minimum investment, Fidelity will 
create a diversified portfolio of six to 13 Fidelity funds for an individual 
client. Fidelity then will manage the portfolio, shifting money among stock, 
bond and money market funds as market conditions change, says James O'Donnell, 
senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the service: 1% a year for the first $100,000, with the fee 
declining as the amount increases. For that fee, a client gets a personal 
Fidelity representative to handle problems or questions at any time, O'Donnell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Until February, Fidelity's minimum investment for the service was just $50,000 
-- an amount within reach of more baby boomers. But the firm's experience in 
the pilot program for the service was that "our reps were being overwhelmed" by 
the time required to deal with clients, O'Donnell said. So the minimum was 
hiked to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity's experience raises the one question Wall Street most fears: Will 
brokerages' costly asset-gathering and asset-management infrastructures be able 
to charge enough to make them profitable? Or will picky boomer customers demand 
too much of brokers and refuse to pay up? 
</P>
<P>
The Nuveen study showed boomers already are far more critical in how they judge 
their financial advisers -- a sign Wall Street will have to work hard for the 
business. While 42% of the over-55 age group in the Nuveen study rated their 
financial adviser "excellent," only 30% of the 35 to 54 group gave that rating. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch's Steffens clearly places the onus on the individual broker and 
the relationship he or she develops with boomer clients. "If we can deliver 
quality, then we can charge the rate," he said. "If we don't do that, then the 
whole strategy fails." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BABY-BOOMER INVESTORS: TOUGH CUSTOMERS 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street faces a big challenge in making brokerage customers out of the baby 
boomers. They'll have plenty of money to invest over the next decade, but they 
may not take it to brokers. And some brokers may not want this finicky group. 
Some results from a summer, 1989, survey of 400 affluent investors for John 
Nuveen &amp; Co.:

In the animal rights movement's largest gathering ever, thousands marched to 
Capitol Hill on Sunday, calling on Congress to limit the use of animals in 
product research and urging Americans to "Eat Beans, Not Beings." 
</P>
<P>
"The animal rights movement has arrived," Peter Linck, one of the march's 
organizers, told a crowd estimated at 24,000 by Park Service police. The rally 
organizers said that 50,000 were there. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a growing lifestyle movement," said Tom Regan, a North Carolina State 
University professor and another organizer of the march. "These people don't 
eat animals. They don't wear animals. And they choose not to use products that 
were tested on animals." 
</P>
<P>
Speakers and march organizers stressed the need for humane treatment of 
animals, mostly avoiding discussions of the tactics that some activists have 
used, such as breaking into farm buildings and medical labs to "liberate" 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
They said that their movement no longer can be labeled as one of either "little 
old ladies in tennis shoes" or "extremists," but rather one that represents 
views shared by most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan condemned 
animal rights activists as "nothing more than animal rights terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
"I want Mr. Sullivan to apologize publicly to the millions of American men, 
women and children who have compassion for animals," said Rep. Tom Lantos 
(D-San Mateo), who heads the informal Congressional Friends of Animals. Other 
speakers included actor Christopher Reeve and singers Grace Slick and Laura 
Nyro. 
</P>
<P>
The marchers came down Pennsylvania Avenue carrying signs such as "Fur Is Dead" 
and "Animals Have Rights, Too." Some carried gruesome photos of dogs, cats and 
other animals that had been subjected to medical experiments. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers maintain that animal testing is crucial to discoveries beneficial 
to humans and that the majority of experiments use rodents. 
</P>
<P>
The march included both the traditional humane societies that protect stray 
animals and more radical groups, such as the Animal Liberation Front, which has 
carried out raids on research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The groups are united in pushing three measures in Congress. One would stop all 
hunting and trapping on federal wildlife refuges. A second would require makers 
of products such as cosmetics and pesticides to seek ways of testing the 
toxicity of their products other than by injecting them into animals. A third 
would forbid the raising of veal calves in small crates. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the House Agriculture Committee will consider a bill later this week 
that could send animal rights protesters to prison for up to three years for 
attacking farms or research labs.

South African black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has rejected all forms of 
anti-Semitism and recognized Israel's right to exist within secure borders, the 
head of a U.S. Jewish delegation that met with Mandela said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Jewish delegation said their meeting with Mandela exceeded their 
"fondest expectations," even though they said he called for direct talks 
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and urged Israel to 
surrender the occupied territories. They said Mandela should be warmly welcomed 
when he visits the United States beginning June 20. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress, told 
journalists after the 2 1/2-hour meeting that Mandela said his African National 
Congress "accepts unequivocally the existence of the state of Israel, not only 
de facto but also its legal right to exist . . . within secure borders." 
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. Jewish groups recently said they would protest Mandela's visit to 
the United States because he had compared the struggle of Palestinians to that 
of black South Africans and publicly embraced PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish delegation made a special trip to Geneva to seek clarification of 
Mandela's positions. 
</P>
<P>
Siegman said the meeting, which lasted 90 minutes longer than expected, put an 
end to the concerns, even though the Jewish delegation disagreed with Mandela's 
views on talks between Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Siegman said the ANC deputy president criticized the Israeli government's 
treatment of Palestinians and called on Jerusalem to hold direct talks with the 
PLO to settle the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising in the territories occupied 
by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Siegman quoted Mandela as saying that Israel's 
borders should not encompass the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank, which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's views are certain to be unpopular with the new right-wing government 
now being formed in Israel. It opposes any territorial concessions to the 
Palestinians and favors pursuing a peace plan that would give only limited 
autonomy to the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Siegman, who coordinated the visit of the Jewish leaders to 
Geneva, said the Jewish community should "join actively and vigorously in 
extending a warm welcome" to Mandela during his 10-day U.S. visit. 
</P>
<P>
He said Mandela would welcome an opportunity to visit Israel if invited by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Siegman said Mandela was "extraordinarily forthcoming and enthusiastic" at the 
private meeting, held at a secret location. ANC representatives could not 
immediately be contacted for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I will probably raise my voice and proclaim he (Mandela) is a friend," said 
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai 
B'rith. "The meeting exceeded our fondest expectations. No Jewish organization 
should have any reservations about . . . the visit." 
</P>
<P>
The American Jewish Congress, National Jewish Community Relations Advisory 
Council, American Jewish Committee, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and 
Union of American Hebrew Congregations were represented at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that a tip from the CIA to 
South African authorities led to Mandela's arrest in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an anonymous retired "former intelligence officer" for the 
United States as saying that a senior American intelligence operative in South 
Africa told him of the spy agency's role in helping South African police arrest 
Mandela on Aug. 5, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the unidentified source as saying there was no reason for 
continued secrecy about a CIA role in the black leader's arrest for plotting to 
overthrow white-minority rule since the ANC deputy president was released from 
prison last February. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Mandela's arrest near Durban, the source said he was told of 
the agency's role by Paul Eckel, described as a senior CIA operative in South 
Africa. Eckel moved to Atlanta after retiring and died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified source said Eckel told him that the CIA's information on 
Mandela's whereabouts had come from a paid informant.

LIKUD BACKS SHAMIR'S PLAN FOR COALITION; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: BUT FOUR LAWMAKERS THREATEN NOT TO SUPPORT HIM DURING A VITAL 
PARLIAMENTARY VOTE ON HIS NEW GOVERNMENT.

<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir won approval to form a new government 
from his right-wing Likud Party on Sunday, but four lawmakers threatened not to 
support the coalition during a crucial parliamentary vote. 
</P>
<P>
Likud's ruling Central Committee gave Shamir its blessing by an overwhelming 
show of hands after the 74-year-old prime minister outlined the policies of his 
new coalition in a passionate speech, promising to strive for peace. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir is due today to present a government made up from religious and 
right-wing parties to the Knesset (Parliament), but he left open the 
possibility of seeking a delay. The new government is to replace Likud's 
alliance with the left-leaning Labor Party -- an alliance that fell apart in 
March over how to proceed with a U.S. peace plan. Shamir has since led a 
caretaker government. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Likud signed a coalition agreement with nine small factions and 
claimed 62 votes in the 120-member Knesset, which has to approve a government 
before it can take power. 
</P>
<P>
But last-minute difficulties arose Sunday after four lawmkers belonging to 
various factions within Likud, angered by Shamir's refusal to give them Cabinet 
posts, threatened to abstain or vote against the government. The potential 
defections could endanger Shamir's narrow majority. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they don't go through with the threat," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he presented his coalition to about 1,500 members of Likud's Central 
Committee at a sports stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow we open a new page in the life of the state, in which Likud will play 
a central and essential role," he said. "We shall talk peace to all the world 
and shall not become tired in assuring everybody that we want peace and shall 
not stop working for peace." 
</P>
<P>
He attacked the Labor Party, which engineered the March 15 collapse of the 
Likud-Labor coalition. He accused the rival party of "subversion" and said it 
wanted to create a leftist coalition and lead Israel "to surrender and national 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir said the new Likud-led coalition will "pay special attention to the 
issue of external and internal security. We shall strengthen the Israeli army 
and all the defense forces that guard the country, and shall strive to give 
them the means necessary to deter any enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir also promised to "deal in a decisive manner" with Palestinian rioters 
but said he believes that most of the 1.7 million Arabs living in the occupied 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip want peace.

Israel plans to open its first liaison office in Beijing this week as a 
diplomatic beachhead, ending decades of estrangement with China, which 
traditionally has supported Israel's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
The office, operated by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities at a 
foreign-managed hotel in downtown Beijing, will technically serve as a 
clearinghouse for academic exchange between the two countries and will not have 
official government status. 
</P>
<P>
Israel and China have no diplomatic relations and are unlikely to establish 
official ties in the foreseeable future. Beijing maintains strong political and 
military ties with Arab nations and has steadfastly supported the Palestinian 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the liaison office, staffed by two Israeli science academy experts, 
represents a watershed in a relationship that has been developing quietly in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
China's immediate interest is obtaining trade and technology from Israel.

STEWARDS HANG ON TO LEGS OF PILOT ALMOST SUCKED THROUGH WINDSHIELD

A British Airways captain was sucked partway through a windshield that blew out 
at 24,000 feet on Sunday, but other crew members managed to cling to him while 
the co-pilot made an emergency landing, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Tim Lancaster, was hospitalized with serious injuries but was 
expected to survive, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said eight passengers were treated for shock. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see a body hanging out of the window with two men and a woman hanging 
on to his legs. They were trying to stop him being sucked out," said passenger 
Margaret Simmonds. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred as the British-built twin-engine BAC-111, carrying 81 
passengers and six crew members, was en route from Birmingham, England, to 
Malaga, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
A British Airways spokesman said a steward was in the forward galley when he 
heard a loud bang and saw Lancaster being pulled from his cockpit seat. 
</P>
<P>
But he managed to grab the pilot's legs. A second steward rushed to his 
assistance "and they held onto him," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The co-pilot turned back and made an emergency landing at Southampton Airport, 
70 miles southwest of London. 
</P>
<P>
The airline spokesman did not know what caused the windshield to shatter. The 
Civil Aviation Authority was investigating.

WAL-MART PLANS ITS FIRST STORES IN CALIFORNIA; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE FIRM'S STRATEGY IS UNLIKE ITS MOVES INTO SMALL TOWNS IN THE 
MIDWEST AND SOUTH. IT IS NOW POISED TO MOVE INTO MARKETS NEAR BIG CITIES.

<P>
Wal-Mart, the Bentonville, Ark.-based discounter with more than 1,400 stores 
nationwide, is now poised to invade California. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to open 10 stores in California in 1990 and 1991, with most 
to be located in the interior sections of the state. This year, it will open 
stores in Lancaster, Victorville, El Centro, Madera, Modesto, Ridgecrest and 
Stockton. In 1991, it plans stores in Elk Grove, Hanford and Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike its moves into small, isolated towns in the Midwest and South, 
Wal-Mart's entry into California is really part of a new corporate strategy 
that is seeing the company start to invade larger markets on the edges of major 
metropolitan areas. In these larger communities, Wal-Mart is likely to have a 
much smaller economic impact than it has had in the rural Midwest and South. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be ringing the big cities, in the outer suburbs," said Woody Whyte, 
a retail analyst with the Stephens Inc. brokerage in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Its stores in Lancaster and Victorville, for instance, will place Wal-Mart for 
the first time on the outer edges of the Southern California metropolitan 
market; Elk Grove, Modesto and Stockton will put the chain just beyond the Bay 
Area-Sacramento metro markets. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, analysts say, the chain is moving into the outer reaches of big 
cities in other sections of the nation, like the Chicago and Atlanta 
metropolitan areas, and is entering some markets on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally we were in rural towns, but we feel we can fill the needs of 
customers in large towns as well," Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jane Arend said. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart's decision to move beyond its small-town roots is part of founder Sam 
M. Walton's strategy to grow dramatically during the coming decade. At the 
company's annual meeting earlier this month, Walton said he hopes that 
Wal-Mart, which now has annual sales of about $26 billion, can hit sales of 
$125 billion a year by the end of the decade. That would make it one of the 
nation's biggest corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Wal-Mart is fully capable of reaching those heights. 
Already, it is on the verge of surpassing Sears to become the nation's largest 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam Walton doesn't promise things if he doesn't think they are do-able," Whyte 
said. "In my opinion, Wal-Mart is one of the best-run companies in America."

Members of Congress may legally solicit four types of payments from special 
interest groups. They are: 
</P>
<P>
PAC Contributions: Political action committees are permitted to collect up to 
$5,000 a year from persons who wish to support their point of view. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, these committees may make contributions of up to $5,000 for each 
primary and $5,000 for each general election to the campaign coffers of a 
member of Congress or candidate for office. Although many corporations and 
labor unions have PACs, the money must come from members or employees, not 
corporate or union treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
Individual Contributions: Individuals also may contribute directly to the 
campaigns of members of Congress or persons running for Congress. No person may 
give more than $2,000 to a single member of Congress or candidate during one 
election cycle -- $1,000 for the primary and $1,000 for the general election. 
In addition, individuals are not allowed to give more than a total of $25,000 
to candidates for federal office in any one year. 
</P>
<P>
Honorariums: All members of Congress may accept up to $2,000 from special 
interests as payment for an appearance or speech. Unlike campaign 
contributions, these fees are personal income. Currently, House members may 
pocket up to $26,850 in honorariums; senators may accept a maximum of $26,568. 
Beginning next year, honorariums will be banned for House members and limited 
to $23,568 for a senator. All fees received beyond these limits must be given 
to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Expenses: Members of Congress may also accept reimbursements from special 
interests for the costs of transportation, lodging, meals and entertainment 
related to speaking engagements.

SUNSHINE EXPECTED AFTER THE LAST OF BORIS DEPARTS

Light showers dampened the deserts and some coastal areas of Southern 
California on Sunday but were expected to clear by late evening, leaving behind 
partly cloudy skies and afternoon sunshine today. 
</P>
<P>
Remnants of Hurricane Boris, a dying tropical storm off the California 
coastline, brought San Diego a second day of record-breaking rainfall for the 
month of June, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, less than a hundredth of an inch of rain fell in Santa Ana 
and San Juan Capistrano, according to WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half an inch fell by late afternoon at Lindbergh Field in San Diego, 
breaking a 140-year-old record set the first year such data began to be 
measured in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Light showers also fell on other areas around San Diego, with 0.75 of an inch 
falling on Escondido, and traces of rain dampening other areas, said Steve 
Burback of WeatherData Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Rain was expected in the desert areas and eastern parts of Los Angeles County 
through Sunday evening, clearing by this morning, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, downtown Los Angeles reached a muggy high of 80 degrees, with 
humidity ranging from 83% in the morning to 54% in the afternoon, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal areas were expected to have partly cloudy morning skies with sunshine 
in the afternoon today. Low clouds may hover again Tuesday morning but the days 
should get warmer with highs in the upper 70s to mid-80s and lows in the upper 
50s to low 60s.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ad: Republican Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In his third television ad unveiled since formally winning the GOP 
gubernatorial primary over little opposition last Tuesday, Sen. Pete Wilson 
presents himself as the best candidate on environmental issues. At the same 
time, the ad attacks campaign tactics used by his Democratic opponent, former 
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, in defeating state Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp -- the closest ally to environmental groups -- in the Democratic 
primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental leaders say that Feinstein has made "strong positive campaign 
pledges" on environmental issues, but her mayoral job did not give her the 
opportunity to build a comprehensive record on statewide issues. The League of 
Conservation Voters credited Wilson with a strong record in some areas, but 
said he was notably weak in others. It gave the strongest assessment to Van de 
Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "If you supported John Van de Kamp in the primary, remember how Dianne 
Feinstein beat him. The Times said Feinstein's brutal negative ad 'tastelessly 
exploits film of a murdered woman's body' to make 'false accusations' against 
Van de Kamp." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The ad quotes an editorial from June 2 editions of the Los Angeles 
Times that criticized the Feinstein commercial for claiming that Van de Kamp 
"tried to drop murder charges against the Hillside Strangler." In fact, as Los 
Angeles County district attorney, Van de Kamp declined to prosecute Angelo 
Buono on murder charges because he thought the case was too weak and he instead 
planned to bring sex charges against Buono while investigators sought more 
evidence to support a murder charge. Buono was convicted of murder in a trial 
on charges brought by the attorney general's office under now-Gov. George 
Deukmejian. The same Times editorial also criticized Van de Kamp for unfairly 
claiming that Feinstein was "a pawn of the insurance industry." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "But you can still vote for a candidate who has won praise from the Sierra 
Club on his fight for clean air, whose environmental record was judged better 
than Feinstein's by the League of Conservation Voters and who fought three 
national administrations to stop offshore drilling." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Wilson did receive strong praise in a letter from Sierra Club 
President Richard Cellerius this spring for "your overwhelming support for 
strengthening amendments to the Senate version of the Clean Air Act." Cellerius 
expressed thanks for Wilson's "consistent support of strong legislation for 
clean air as well as other environmental protection measures." 
</P>
<P>
While the League of Conservation Voters did not rank the candidates in any 
order, its assessment of their records gave the strongest marks in seven 
categories to Van de Kamp followed by Wilson and then Feinstein. It was 
difficult to compare Feinstein's record to those of Wilson and Van de Kamp, but 
the league commended her for support of coastal protection, sewage pollution 
control and San Francisco's municipal transit system; said she had a moderate 
record on toxics but no leadership role, and gave her mixed, but generally 
negative, marks on growth control in downtown San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has been a consistent leader in the Senate in opposition to additional 
offshore oil exploration and drilling in federal waters off the California 
coast, putting him in direct opposition to the policies of the Reagan and Bush 
administrations.

PASSENGERS EVACUATED AFTER CRUISE SHIP RUNS AGROUND OFF CAPE COD

A 617-foot cruise ship ran aground two miles off Cape Cod in dense fog Sunday 
morning, forcing the evacuation of about 1,100 vacationing passengers and crew, 
the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bermuda Star, bound for Provincetown, Mass., from New York City, ran 
aground in a shallow, rocky area about 8:30 a.m. as the vessel approached the 
Cape Cod Canal at the beginning of the peninsula, Coast Guard spokesman Steve 
Aitkins said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 687 passengers or 380 crew members aboard were hurt, Aitkins said. 
He said the ship took on water for about 90 minutes, but the flooding was 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual. You just don't have that many professional cruise liners going 
around Buzzard's Bay," said Gregg Peterson, Coast Guard senior quartermaster at 
Woods Hole. "They usually don't get that far out of the channel. I don't know 
what they were doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
Three Coast Guard cutters were sent to assist the Panama-flag ship, and divers 
tried to assess damage to the hull. Fuel containment booms were set up around 
the vessel, and a spill of between 500 to 1,000 gallons of fuel was under 
control by midday. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard initially denied the captain's request that passengers be 
evacuated from the vessel and planned to try to dislodge the ship from the 
ocean floor at high tide. When that effort failed, several ferries were 
dispatched to the ship to remove passengers to shore. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's owner, Bermuda Star Lines of Teaneck, N.J., arranged hotel 
accommodations or bus transportation home for the stranded passengers. 
</P>
<P>
When the ship struck bottom, it apparently was waiting for fog to clear so that 
it could turn into the Cape Cod Canal, a waterway separating the hook-shaped 
cape from the mainland.

ONE WETLAND TO BE BULLDOZED, ANOTHER PLANTED; 
</P>
<P>
NATURE: LAST WEEK'S TRANSPORTATION VOTE MEANS A WOODLAND WILL BE DESTROYED FOR 
A FREEWAY. BUT CALTRANS WORKERS ARE ALREADY NURTURING A NEW ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Voter approval of a massive transportation initiative will ensure the 
destruction of a six-acre woodland in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura County's first man-made forest already is springing up to take its 
place along a creek surrounded by scrub-covered hills. 
</P>
<P>
The passage last week of Proposition 111, which will double gas taxes 
statewide, ensures completion of a $50-million project connecting the Simi 
Valley Freeway with the Moorpark Freeway. Lying directly in the path of the 
bulldozers is a lush, wooded creekbed near College View Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that any important vegetation or wildlife habitat destroyed 
by a roads project must be replaced. So the state Department of Transportation 
has spent nearly $1 million during the past four months planting 5,000 native 
trees and shrubs in a 12-acre preserve near Arroyo Simi Creek just east of 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Still in its infancy, the reserve resembles a large garden, with black and 
white irrigation lines snaking between cottonwood, elderberry, oak, sycamore 
and willow trees. Sections have been carefully marked off with stakes bearing 
blue and orange tags where Caltrans workers are monitoring growth. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans biologist Monica Finn is the creative force behind this nascent 
wilderness. She said she is a little nervous replacing what nature created with 
an overgrown garden fashioned with her own hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We're losing one, and we're creating another, and we don't really know if the 
plants will stay here," Finn said. "That's what's exciting. . . . All of that 
is chance." 
</P>
<P>
But little of Finn's work has been left to chance. Workers planted seven types 
of trees and built two irrigation ditches. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the work designing the woods and creekbed was done by a private 
landscaper, but it will be up to Caltrans to keep it thriving for the next five 
years. Then the land may be turned over to Moorpark College as a back-yard 
nature center, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The trees already are three feet tall and have a good chance of surviving, 
thanks to the ditches, pumps and a drip irrigation system that will continue to 
water them until their roots are able to tap into the ground water less than 10 
feet below. 
</P>
<P>
The project is called a wetlands, but instead of a swampy marshland the name 
evokes, trees and shrubs loom out of semi-dry brush. 
</P>
<P>
Finn said she hopes the Caltrans project eventually will become a "mosaic of 
trees" that will blend in with the natural woods that are already home to 
rabbits and ground squirrels. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials expect to see most of the plants thrive on their own without 
help from humans. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the trees planted in the area were cuttings from trees already found 
near the Arroyo Simi, said Caltrans engineer Frank Latham. The Arroyo Simi 
carries treated waste water from the Simi Valley sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
The waste water actually is more beneficial than the ground water because it 
contains nitrates that plants need to survive, Latham said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the continued drought depletes underground water sources, waste water 
from the treatment plant will continue to flow in the creek, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as there's people flushing their toilets, we're going to have water," 
Latham said. 
</P>
<P>
The area is under the care of a private landscaper until next year. Then 
Caltrans will maintain the woodlands until it can make arrangements for the 
area to be preserved as a nature center. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials are negotiating with Moorpark College officials to take over 
the preservation of the 12-acre site, Finn said. If an agreement is reached, 
the area would be turned over to the college for research, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole lot of interesting research that can be obtained from this 
wetlands," Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
"People could also be looking at what birds come into this new site," she said. 
"It would be interesting to see what species come in." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five bird species already nest in the wooded area surrounding the 
Caltrans project, and another 35 are likely to nest in the area temporarily 
during fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
One endangered bird that could make its way back to Moorpark and other parts of 
eastern Ventura County is the Least Bell's Vireo, a songbird that nests in 
riparian willow trees -- those bordering streams. The bird was last spotted 
near the Arroyo Simi four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the preservation of wetlands in Moorpark would be 
welcomed by bird watchers and conservationists who see habitats for birds being 
erased across the county. 
</P>
<P>
The Least Bell's Vireo has disappeared from most of the county, but still nests 
in the Santa Clara riverbed near Fillmore, Audubon Society member Karl Krause 
said. The survival of the songbird "is a pretty good indication of the state of 
the riparian habitat, and that's pretty poor in this county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark College environmental science professor Muthena Naseri said the 
man-made woods also are a convenient spot where students can observe nature at 
work. The area could be incorporated into a field study to observe the effects 
of air pollution and stream erosion, Naseri said. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Caltrans and Moorpark College are expected to last through 
this month. If negotiations succeed, environmental science or biology classes 
using the Caltrans project could be incorporated into the academic schedule as 
early as next fall, the professor said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have a ready-built laboratory next door," he said.

FATHER OF SCHOOL STRATEGY TELLS HOW TO INVOLVE PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. James P. Comer came from a poor black family struggling to survive in the 
grimy steel town of East Chicago, Ind., after his father died when he was 6. 
Yet he, along with his brothers and sisters, made it through high school and 
beyond to garner 13 college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Success came in large part because of their mother, who Comer says worked 
terribly hard to nurture a learning environment at home. She was also dogged 
enough to figure out the school's way of doing things and work with teachers to 
boost the school's expectations for her children. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Comer remembered three close classmates from elementary school who fell 
short along the way -- one who died early of alcoholism, a second who ended up 
in jails most of his life, the third who has spent much of his life in mental 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Using his own experiences, the professor of psychiatry at Yale Medical School 
asked what could be done to help the large number of minority parents who -- 
unlike his mother -- have been unable by themselves to give their children the 
tools to be good learners, despite innate qualities of caring and a desire to 
want to help. 
</P>
<P>
Today he can point to the "Comer Model" as the fruit of his long research. It 
is a deceptively simple prescription for educators to bring parents and 
children into the school culture and boost academic achievement by making them 
feel welcome, in large part, through a comprehensive social program. 
</P>
<P>
First tried in New Haven, the Comer plan has taken root in a half-dozen 
communities around the nation and will be a key part of renewal plans at three 
San Diego Unified District schools beginning in the 1990-91 school year: Baker 
Elementary in Southeast San Diego, Valencia Park Elementary, and Jackson 
Elementary in East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Comer talked about the ABCs of his model while in San Diego last week to 
address graduates at the UC San Diego Medical School. The plan, now part of 
Yale's School Development Program that he oversees, was chosen in January for 
$3 million in annual funding by the Rockefeller Foundation over the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
At its heart is the fact that parental support is critical to academic 
achievement of children. 
</P>
<P>
"Children attach first to their own parents and to the social network that the 
parents are part of, and they carry those attitudes and values and ways as they 
develop, and they interact with school people based on these norms they take 
from home," Comer said. 
</P>
<P>
"When those norms are in line with the mainstream culture of the school -- 
mainstream or middle-class values and attitudes -- then there is no problem. 
But, when those attitudes are marginal, or antisocial, you've got a problem 
when those kids go to school." 
</P>
<P>
Many low-income minority parents did not have successful experiences in school 
themselves, Comer said. Therefore they need help to see how they can sustain a 
teacher's efforts at home and give realism to those same dreams they hold for 
their children as do middle-class parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The school has to understand that learning is not simply a mechanical process 
based on ability, but that it grows out of the quality of relationships that 
the teacher has with the child, that the teacher has with the parents, and that 
the parents have with the child," Comer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers have no power if they don't deal with the home-school relationship 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
But how to get at the problem, when many teachers already feel overworked and 
overwhelmed by the social problems of many children who show up in their 
classes? 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the school needs to reach out to parents through social 
interactions, beginning with potluck suppers, welcome-back nights, Christmas 
parties and the like, at which genuine respect between the two groups can begin 
to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Once that rapport takes root, the school can move to seminars at which teachers 
and parents talk about the math program, about the English program, about ways 
that parents can help at home, ways parents can talk with their children at the 
supermarket, "about all sorts of ways parents can mediate," or expand, on 
learning experiences that happen in school. There can be sessions on 
child-rearing techniques and related activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than teaching parents per se, you create the programs that allow them" 
to bring those skills to school that they may already have "and which the 
school can take advantage of," Comer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents find out that the climate of the school is supportive" and they 
begin to emphasize behaviors at home that will integrate with those behaviors 
required of children at school, Comer said. "And then the children see that 
their parents aren't dumb, that their parents represent the same kinds of 
models being pushed in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
The key mechanism for integrating the many activities is called the governance 
and management team, a group of parents, teachers and school support employees 
headed by the principal. The team receives support from two other bodies: a 
parent team and a mental-health team composed of a social worker, psychologist, 
special education teacher, nurse, and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
The management team draws up the social calendar for the year, a listing of all 
the parent-school activities with which the school can draw parents gradually 
into its web, Comer said. But these activities must relate to the academics as 
much as possible, and not just deal with things on the periphery of school 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
As one example, Comer cited a field trip planned to a Jackie Robinson exhibit 
in New York for a New Haven school. "We talked to children about the skills 
they would need on the trip and we practiced them, such as what to say to Mrs. 
Robinson, how to ask questions about the exhibit, how to conduct yourself going 
down on the bus, where you stop for lunch, all these things relating to social 
skills but also to language skills, the curriculum as well," Comer said. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents attended as well, picking up on these skills "but without ever 
having to say, 'I don't know how to do this' and being reluctant to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
In another case, the mental health team noticed that students transfering into 
a school often displayed anti-social behavior, such as hitting teachers or 
other students. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of those cases, the team recognized that the school needed a transfer 
policy, and so it developed an orientation program for new students and helped 
prevent that problem from" remaining prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
Comer said that, although many parts of his model sound simple, "I'm not saying 
that this is very easy, since there are difficult times, but I'm not saying 
it's all that tough either. 
</P>
<P>
"The major difficulty can come if you have people (at the school) whose 
personalities won't allow them to share with or respect people who are poor, or 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Comer also is worried that representatives from the three San Diego schools may 
not have spent enough time in New Haven observing how the model operates, 
although at one school in Texas, teachers successfully put the plan into effect 
merely from reading about Comer's work. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, there has to be agreement that you don't focus on faults of teachers or 
parents, that there has to be consensus decision making, and that there can't 
be winners or losers, in that the principal is ignored or that the principal 
ignores other people," Comer said. 
</P>
<P>
Under average conditions, Comer said three years may be necessary to see 
significant improvements in a school. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, a school might have only five or six parents who participate, 
but Comer said educators should not panic. Comer gave the example of one parent 
in New Haven who initially could not understand why the school had any interest 
in having her show up. 
</P>
<P>
"She felt she had nothing she could contribute to professionals, but after a 
period of time, after getting involved in some activities, she recognized she 
had some ability," Comer said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman eventually finished high school, went to college and is now a dean of 
a community college. 
</P>
<P>
"But, in general, we're talking about parents simply becoming better teachers 
of their children, giving skills that make them succeed in school academically, 
by having the school create experiences for them that will lead to that. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, when you have parents who stay away from school, that is a model 
that says to children that 'schools are dangerous for us, that they are not 
like us.' "

GUNSLINGERS TAKE AIM AT COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was an ideal morning for pistol combat -- temperatures in the high 70s, low 
humidity, a few clouds to screen out the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Close to 20 men took advantage of the opportunity at the Ventura Parks and 
Recreation Department's monthly competition Sunday at the Grant Park Pistol 
Range. 
</P>
<P>
For civilians, it was a unique chance to match skills with the top shooters in 
the state, since Ventura has the only Police Combat Competition in the country 
open to the general public, range master Cliff Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
For law enforcement officers, who made up most of the field, it was a warm-up 
for the California Police Olympics to be held in Sacramento June 25 to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
For all, it was an opportunity to engage in police combat without being shot. 
</P>
<P>
The pistol combat competition consists of five matches combining different 
distances, time limits and positions from which competitors unload on a human 
silhouette. Unlike the more popular bull's-eye competitions, combat is designed 
to resemble situations officers confront in everyday work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much more intense than golf," said Maurice Portnoy, 62, a defense 
industry executive. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Agent Erik Roberts, 45, said he got interested in the sport when 
he was shot in 1973. He was working undercover and a drug deal in Ojai came 
undone, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy came from behind a building and ambushed us. I got shot three times, 
in the leg, the side and the back. I turned around and returned fire, unloading 
all six rounds. Hit the guy in the leg once but missed the other five times. 
That's when I said to myself, 'You gotta learn to shoot. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Roberts tied for second, scoring 1488 out of 1500. He will do better 
in Sacramento, he promised. 
</P>
<P>
"One time in L.A. there was this guy barricaded and the only cover we had was a 
bunch of buildings," recalled Irvine Police Officer Mario Casas, 33. "The 
barricade position here teaches you how to shoot while taking cover. A lot of 
guys expose their whole torso when they shoot out of a barricade, but in 
competition you only expose your hand and the corner of your eye. If you 
practice enough, it becomes automatic." 
</P>
<P>
As Casas scored a 1487, his girlfriend, Lenora Berdner, sat behind the range at 
a picnic table, enjoying the sun and browsing through a magazine. It was her 
first time at the range and she wasn't crazy about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to hate guns, but now that I'm around Mario there's more guns lying 
around and I think I should learn more about them." But she isn't quite ready 
to ask Casas, whom she met six months ago, to teach her how to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
The pistol match "was a good way to spend the morning," she said. "I like it 
because it makes Mario a better shooter on the job, and that makes me feel 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the civilians who took part for the first time were elated. Portnoy, 
the defense executive, seemed thrilled with his 1140 score after just a few 
months of practice. 
</P>
<P>
Portnoy can remember the exact day and time when he decided to switch from 
driving ranges to pistol ranges: 4:30 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 24, 1989. He was 
retrieving documents from his company's Boyle Heights warehouse when he saw a 
group of gang members smearing the walls with graffiti. Portnoy picked up his 
cellular phone and called police. A gang member picked up a shotgun and blew 
two holes into his car. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before Portnoy started taking shooting lessons at a Beverly 
Hills range. Since then, he said, he has always carried his .38 revolver to 
work. "I've become my own security guard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John McKinney, 43, took up the sport again six months ago. For him, it meant a 
return after 20 years to something he always had enjoyed. As a teen-ager, 
McKinney said, he liked to hunt for deer and bear. But in 1967 he joined the 
CIA and did a three-month stint in Vietnam at the height of the war. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned, he didn't want to hunt. "I couldn't stand killing again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago he picked up a pistol again, but only for target practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hobby I can practice for the rest of my life," he said, adding that in 
his job, "I don't carry a gun but sometimes I wish I did." McKinney is a tax 
collector for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
For Royal Whitfield, 39, a manager of a Montebello lighting company, pistol 
competitions are ideal family outings. "We have a recreational vehicle, so we 
take the kids and make a road trip out of it. And when we go camping in the 
desert I always take the guns to do some plinking." 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield's stepson, Justin Williams, 12, watched his dad score an impressive 
1488. Justin said he is looking forward to his next trip to a shooting range. 
"I like it a lot," he said. "I just like guns." 
</P>
<P>
Most combatants said they shoot for relaxation, fun and camaraderie, and only a 
few stayed around to hear Cox announce the winner. Mark E. Peterson, 31, 
representative of the California Highway Patrol, obliterated the heart of a 
silhouette for a score of 1489. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson -- the defending state Police Pistol Combat champion -- said he got 
involved in the sport last year after a drunk-driving suspect pulled Peterson's 
gun out of its holster and shot at himfrom a foot away. He missed. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me realize that there really are people out there who want to kill us 
police officers, and the best way to survive is to be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
The competition, he said, picking up his empty shells, "prepares you for the 
ultimate -- to be in a gun battle and win it."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: STAR CABBY THINKS HIS PEERS STILL HAVE A 
LONG WAY TO GO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The way I see it, Bob Alexander has managed to elude the three scourges that 
afflict San Diego cabdrivers: bankruptcy, robbery and hemorrhoids. 
</P>
<P>
For that alone, Alexander might merit an award. 
</P>
<P>
But it's for other things -- like fetching lost luggage, keeping a spotless cab 
and a sunny attitude, and making hospital and Blood Bank trips -- that 
Alexander, 42, has been named Cab Driver of the Year by the Convention &amp; 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
He's as San Diego as a sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
He looks like the lost Beach Boy. He has a 35-foot sailboat and spent five 
years skippering sailboats for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
He sees himself as part of the travel industry, not just a hack driver. He 
dreams of latching on the America's Cup competition in 1992, maybe as 
coordinator of ground transportation. 
</P>
<P>
He'll be feted today at Fat City restaurant as part of the 12th Annual Cab 
Driver Appreciation Day. He'll get a plaque, $200, 500 business cards and a 
trip to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The runners-up and other drivers will be there for an afternoon of cabbie 
bonhomie, complete with zoo animals and television personalities. 
</P>
<P>
There is the tiniest of problems, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Cab Driver of the Year thinks many San Diego cabdrivers deserve a boot in 
the butt, not a pat on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of them lack a professional, businesslike attitude," said Alexander, who 
leases from Yellow Cab. 
</P>
<P>
"I see so many drivers just preying on the traveling tourists by taking 
advantage whenever possible: by not taking people directly from point A to 
point B, by not offering information about the city." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks cabbies should go to etiquette school. 
</P>
<P>
For himself, Alexander is always looking for ways to attract a high-tipping 
clientele. He's got a cellular phone in his cab. 
</P>
<P>
He's also thinking of installing a fax machine. As I said, he's very San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Case of Offending, Keep Trap Shut 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't it seem that suddenly the San Diego woods are full of people bawling 
moral instruction to their neighbors? 
</P>
<P>
Some days the din from these secular preachers using the public prints and 
airwaves to improve the public's morals/eco-consciousness/sensitivity is near 
ear-splitting: 
</P>
<P>
The community is becoming more diverse, and we -- that means you, brother -- 
need to respect that. There are diverse reasons for this diversity, and we 
should respect those, too. 
</P>
<P>
We should save water and recycle glass, plastic and newspapers. Next time you 
flush, think of the guy next door. 
</P>
<P>
Government at all levels is going to hell in a handbasket. I can't remember 
when it's been this bad before, although admittedly (also arguably) I have a 
bad memory. 
</P>
<P>
We need to set the agenda. There's nothing worse than an unset agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we should have a meeting. Throw out the press and let everybody in the 
city say what he/she feels. 
</P>
<P>
The sportswriters say such a meeting helped the Padres. For a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
Some people in San Diego care only about their own statistics. I told that to a 
New York writer. 
</P>
<P>
There are things you had better not do, and things you better not say. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives worry that someone might burn the flag. Liberals worry that 
someone might use "fighting words" and offend this group or that at the 
University of California. 
</P>
<P>
The only safe thing is to stay in your room: wrapped in the flag, mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, restrict the flow in your shower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once More, With Humor 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's a comic. 
</P>
<P>
* License plate on a La Jolla-bound BMW: "CPA TAXY."

* Spotted in Encinitas: migrant on a street corner wearing a Border Patrol hat. 
</P>
<P>
* Come-on line by undercover FBI agent to Richard T. Silberman: "I'm a 
different breed of businessman." 
</P>
<P>
I'll say. The breed that can put you in the slammer for 75 years.

TEACHERS, DISTRICT TO DISCUSS REPAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of the Simi Valley teachers union will meet with district 
officials today to discuss how to repay an estimated $300,000 in salary 
overpayments to instructors caused by a clerical error. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Davenport, president of the Simi Valley Educators Assn., said that one 
option would be to cut back a projected 11% raise for teachers next year as a 
way to reimburse the district. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility," Davenport said. "We have made a proposal to them, and now 
we need to talk about the figures. We're going to meet Monday to see if we can 
resolve the situation." 
</P>
<P>
A recent in-house audit revealed that the district's 750 teachers were overpaid 
$200 to $400 during the 1989-1990 school year as a result of a clerical error. 
School officials said someone apparently misread the teachers' salary schedule 
when the district was putting together its budget last June. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake, and now we're rectifying it," said Dan Hill, district 
director of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Hill declined to talk about details of the upcoming meeting with union 
officials or the proposed cutback in the teachers' raise. 
</P>
<P>
"They're willing to work with us," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the salary error comes at a time when the district is 
struggling to cope with a projected $8-million deficit for next year. The 
district has proposed to lay off 32 temporary teachers and reassign dozens of 
administrators to lower-level positions with reduced salaries to offset the 
deficit. CARLOS LOZANO

DEPARTMENTS SEEK HIGHER ALLOCATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors will be asked Tuesday to help bolster the budgets of 
the county library, Fire Protection District and other agencies by reallocating 
state funds. 
</P>
<P>
The county's share of Special District Augmentation Funds in fiscal year 
1990-91 is $23.7 million, $3.2 million more than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The money has been allocated to various county departments already. 
</P>
<P>
But Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg, as he has done 
unsuccessfully before, is asking the supervisors to grant special help to some 
districts at the expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wittenberg, agencies that receive little or no money from fees and 
other revenues deserve higher Special District Augmentation Fund allocations 
than others. 
</P>
<P>
County districts for which he will request special bailout funds include the 
library, $3.9 million; fire protection, $18 million; and flood control, 
$500,000. JACK SEARLES

PROTEST STALLS RADIO ANTENNA ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS CHARVONIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attempt by the Camarillo Planning Commission to write an ordinance 
controlling the installation of amateur radio antennas has been stalled because 
radio operators protested. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving complaints from at least one resident about the appearance of 
some shortwave radio antennas and support towers, the City Council asked the 
Planning Department to draft a zoning ordinance controlling them. 
</P>
<P>
The aim was to limit the overall height of antennas to 75 feet when in use and 
35 feet when collapsed and not being used. All parts of the support tower and 
antenna would be required to be in the rear or side yard of a home and no 
closer than five feet from any property line. 
</P>
<P>
The rules would not apply to existing units. But about two dozen amateur radio 
operators protested, saying the restrictions might limit the ability of new 
towers to transmit and receive signals. 
</P>
<P>
Several offered to work with planners on an acceptable ordinance. The 
commission continued the public hearing and debate until July 17. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners also approved the development of three land parcels for 
the eventual construction of residential units. 
</P>
<P>
Churchman Corp., owned by local developer Glenn Churchman, will be allowed to 
divide a 4.68-acre vacant lot in the Las Posas Estates neighborhood into four 
lots to build single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Smith of Newbury Park got permission to build three houses on a vacant 
lot on Fulton Street between Barry and Lomita streets. Because the lot is 
narrow, a city requirement for a recreational vehicle parking space was 
deleted. 
</P>
<P>
The division of a 1.25-acre parcel into two lots was granted to Giovanni 
Tromba. It will enable him to build a house on one lot and sell the other. The 
property, which was annexed by the city in 1978, is east of Terra Bella Lane 
and north of Upland Road. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners agreed to consider allowing a recreational-vehicle sales 
and services complex within the city's limited-manufacturing zone, where retail 
sales are generally prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners also modified landscaping requirements for commercial, industrial 
and large residential developments in an effort to cut water use. 
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines limit the amount of lawn used on a project to a maximum of 
30% of the landscaped area and spell out what type of watering systems should 
be used. The modifications require that irrigation systems include an automatic 
shut-off device for rain periods, and that drip or micro-spray systems be used 
when appropriate, such as in flower boxes or around shrubs. RUSS CHARVONIA

YOU BORED WITH THE SUPERVISORS?; 
</P>
<P>
THE JUDGE IS RIGHT AND MOST ANGELENOS KNOW IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon has given the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors until June 27 to revise the district lines they drew in 1981, when 
they illegally conspired to disenfranchise the county's 2 million Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Good sense and a decent respect for their sworn obligation to the Constitution 
would dictate that the supervisors comply. Unfortunately, in this affair the 
board's majority -- Supervisors Kenneth Hahn and Edmund D. Edelman dissenting 
-- has so far given scant evidence of either quality. It is never too late, 
however, to do the right thing -- especially since the consequences of not 
doing so are clear. 
</P>
<P>
June 27 "is, quite respectfully, a deadline," Kenyon told the board's attorney 
Thursday, when he made his ruling. For all his tact, Kenyon is understandably 
out of patience with the obstinate majority on the five-member board. That 
obstinacy is nowhere more apparent than in the majority's insistence on 
pursuing an appeal that is both costly and legally without merit. As Kenyon 
admonished the board, failure to present a legally acceptable plan will force 
him to draw the new lines himself. 
</P>
<P>
That would be unfortunate, for, as the city of Los Angeles' recent experience 
has demonstrated, the public's battered confidence in local government is 
enhanced when it sees elected officials putting their own house in order. On a 
more utilitarian level, it also is clear that the redistricting plan the 
supervisors devised in 1981 was not simply one that perpetuated a system that 
has denied Latinos, African-Americans and Asian-Americans representation on the 
board for 115 years, but one that virtually guarantees an inefficient, 
unaccountable county government. 
</P>
<P>
A five-member board cannot adequately govern a county whose population of 8.5 
million is larger than those of 42 states. In this case, then, the path to 
equal opportunity for the minority is also the path to responsible, responsive 
government for all. That means a plan that expands the board to seven or more 
seats, and whether that scheme is drawn by the board or by Judge Kenyon, that 
is what the people of Los Angeles County have a right to expect. 
</P>
<P>
Still unresolved is the question of whether Kenyon will overturn the results of 
last Tuesday's election in the 1st District, where the top vote-getter was, in 
fact, a Latina, Sarah Flores. It is difficult not to sympathize with her 
predicament and that of her run-off opponent, Judge Gregory O'Brien, who is 
himself in favor of expanding the board. But Kenyon may have to invalidate the 
election, as judges have in many cases involving violations of the Voting 
Rights Act in the South. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, it will be well to recall that this bitter disgrace was laid 
upon the people of Los Angeles not by a judge, but by a board majority that 
gives the appearance of being lost to almost any consideration but 
self-interest. 
</P>
<P>

IF WE ARE TO HAVE A TRUE PEACE, THE REST OF THE WORLD MUST BE GIVEN A SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson writes a syndicated column from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first met Mikhail Gorbachev in December, 1985, in Geneva, I came away 
impressed by his vision of the world. After having had the privilege recently 
to meet with him again, at a luncheon he hosted for American political leaders, 
entertainers and scholars during the summit in Washington, I am even more 
convinced of his commitment to world peace. 
</P>
<P>
When we first met, he had the courage and boldness to step outside of the 
assumptions of the old Cold War bureaucracy. I was in Geneva leading a 
delegation of United States peace activists who were supporting the first 
summit between President Reagan and Gorbachev. We had 1 million signatures on 
petitions urging a reduction in the arms race to present to the two leaders. 
Our President refused to see us. But the man labeled by President Reagan as the 
leader of "an evil empire" did see us. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in a crowded rotunda inside the Soviet Embassy, I saw Gorbachev at the 
other end of the hall. Before his stunned aides, our excited delegation and 
more than 100 press people, we greeted each other and held our talk there in 
the open, rather than in a private room. He accepted the petitions and we 
exchanged views. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years since then, Gorbachev has played a major role in planting 
new seeds of hope. It is as if he is adhering to the words of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. -- "We must learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we will 
die apart as fools." 
</P>
<P>
At the luncheon in Washington, which was attended by former Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger, economist John Kenneth Galbraith and others, Gorbachev caught 
many of his guests off guard. Many of these advocates of the Cold War military 
buildup were stunned by his pronouncements that a new world order was before 
us. He talked about joint ventures, in oil explorations, for our environment 
and in space development initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Without the threat of dropping any bombs, Gorbachev has helped shift the world 
from standing on the brink of war to discussing long-term peace. The world has 
indeed moved from fear to hope. We are moving away from nightmarish thoughts of 
the aftermath of a nuclear war. Instead we are moving toward finding avenues to 
increase tourism and expanded student exchange programs between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
For this optimism to spread across the world, it is important that all of the 
world leaders convene and talk. Unfortunately, when Bush and Gorbachev hold 
summits, only a minority of the world is represented. Together, America and the 
Soviet Union make up only one-tenth of the human race. The point is that 60% of 
all human beings are Asian; one-third of that 60% are Chinese. One-eighth of 
the human race is African; more than one-fifth of Africans are Nigerian. There 
are more than a dozen nations in the Middle East. There are 833 million people 
in India, 300 million more than the United States and Soviet Union combined. 
Two-thirds of our neighbors in the Americas speak Spanish and Portuguese. Most 
people in the world are yellow, brown, black, non-Christian, poor, young and 
don't speak English. 
</P>
<P>
Our global village is not so big. Four years ago, when we first got word that 
there was an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, it was dismissed as a 
Soviet problem. But it was actually a problem for all the Soviet Union's 
neighbors. Later, cows as far away as Oregon had health problems related to 
that accident. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush and Gorbachev can meet to discuss matters that affect all of us on 
Earth, then why can't the leaders of the Middle Eastern countries also be 
there? Why not a delegation of African presidents at that table, as well as 
leaders from the Far East and Central and South America? 
</P>
<P>
This process for changing the world is coming from a few. The ultimate peace 
agreement will be the one when the rest of the world is represented at the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
This hope explosion is taking place at the right time in our history. It will 
inevitably have a providential impact on our national debate regarding the 
peace dividend, as we insist that the military budget be drastically cut and 
the benefits be directed to meet urgent human needs at home. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate benefactors in this peace process will be the children of the 
world. They will no longer have to grow up burdened and fearful of nuclear war. 
That's why the decision to save the world should be a shared vision by all of 
the leaders of the world.

WEEKEND VIOLENCE LEAVES 2 DEAD, 4 HURT

A rash of shootings and stabbings in the San Diego area late Saturday and early 
Sunday left two persons dead and four wounded, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The violence included another shooting in the dark canyons near the 
U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a major traffic accident on California 79 near Aguanga on the 
Riverside County line Sunday afternoon killed three people, the San Diego 
County coroner's office reported. There were no other details available late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
An undocumented alien, Octavio Calderon, was shot once in the back as he walked 
along Old Monument Road about a half-mile north of the U.S.-Mexican border at 
11:50 p.m. Saturday night, San Diego Police reported. Officers heard six shots 
in the 3200 block of Old Monument Road shortly before finding Calderon. He was 
taken by Life Flight helicopter to UCSD Medical Center, where he was reported 
in serious condition late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported that Leonardo Cabrera, 22, died at UCSD Medical Center early 
Sunday morning, after being shot three times about 10 p.m. Saturday in the 400 
block of 33rd Street in Southeast San Diego. His assailants were believed to be 
two men in a gray compact car. A police spokesman said witnesses told 
authorities that the shooting occurred during what appeared to be a drug 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
A second Latino man in his late teens or early 20s, who had not been identified 
by the coroner's office, was killed by a single gunshot near the corner of 21st 
and Market streets about 1 a.m. Sunday by unknown attackers, the police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, an unidentified transvestite reportedly showed up at a 
store at 24th and Market streets with a single gunshot wound in the upper right 
arm. The spokesman said it was not clear whether the two shootings were 
related. 
</P>

Just before midnight Saturday, Tilford Raven was found lying on the sidewalk 
near 48th and Market streets in Southeast San Diego with a stab wound, police 
said. Raven told police that several people "came out of nowhere" and stabbed 
him. The police spokesman said Raven was taken to Physicians &amp; Surgeons 
Hospital, but an emergency room nurse refused to release any information Sunday 
concerning him. 
</P>
<P>
In a second stabbing, Lane Johnson, 41, told police he was knifed in the left 
lower back by two men as he walked along Ocean View Boulevard in Southeast San 
Diego about 1 a.m. Johnson called police from his home in the 300 block of 
South 36th Street and was taken to UCSD Medical Center, where he was reported 
in fair condition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In Escondido, police reported that 18-year-old Mariano Orozco was shot in the 
leg during a fight in the 500 block of north Grape Street shortly after 2 a.m. 
He was treated at Palomar Medical Center and released. No suspects have been 
arrested, police said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SUDDENLY HE HAD A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past 15 years, the Fair Housing Council of Orange County has worn two 
important hats. With the help of funds from the cities and county government, 
the nonprofit council has fought discrimination in housing at the same time it 
has helped resolve disputes between tenants and landlords. It is that second 
mission that has proved troublesome for David T. Quezada, the 40-year-old 
executive director who was suspended without pay last week. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of hats, Quezada discovered for himself in recent weeks just how 
complicated things can get when you wear more than one. In addition to being 
the executive director of the council, he allowed himself to fall into a 
category fraught with potential awkwardness and embarrassment: He's a landlord, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
The council's board chairman gives Quezada high marks for his consistent record 
as an advocate for tenants rights. He runs an organization with enough 
credibility in Fullerton, to cite one place, that the agency is where the 
city's code enforcement officer refers tenants who have problems getting 
landlords to fix code violations. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder, then, that a city inspector was surprised when she looked at a 
duplex on East Truslow Avenue that had rotten floors, cracked windows and 
leaking plumbing and learned that the owner was the executive director of the 
county's Fair Housing Council. A check of city records also turned up an 
illegal third rental unit in the back of the duplex. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada later said he had heard no complaints until he tried to evict tenants 
from one of the three units in the building so that he could convert the 
building back to a legal, two-unit complex. Yet the executive director of an 
organization pledged to resolving landlord-tenant problems can ill-afford to 
get caught up in such a dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada's triplex masquerading as a duplex became the focus of a joint 
inspection by the Orange County Health Department, the city Fire Department and 
the Building Department. That kind of attention a Fair Housing Council doesn't 
need. Both the director and his board were embarrassed, as they should have 
been, and he was called on the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decision to suspend Quezada without pay until he corrected 
violations was fair enough, considering the high marks he has received for his 
work. Yet it should be clear to him now what should have been obvious in the 
first place. You can't wear the hat of a fair-housing advocate when you wear 
another as slumlord.

NBA FINALS: DETROIT'S 121-106 VICTORY IN PORTLAND IS ITS FIRST THERE IN 16 
YEARS, AND GIVES THE DEFENDING CHAMPIONS A 2-1 SERIES LEAD.

<TEXT>
<P>
For Blazermaniacs hoping to spend the week reminding America how overlooked 
they are, there was a little reversal. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-bellow of righteous indignation Sunday, they took a shot to the 
collective Adam's apple from Detroit's Bad Boys, who turned the NBA finals 
around again, beating the Trail Blazers, 121-106, in their own beloved, little, 
packed, loud Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first home loss for the Blazers this postseason and the Pistons' 
first victory here in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
It gave Detroit, which had just lost the homecourt advantage in this series, 
its edge back. The Pistons lead the series, 2 games to 1. Game 4 will be played 
here Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 3, the Pistons were led by Joe Dumars, who ended his slump with 33 
points -- and then learned of the death of his father. 
</P>
<P>
Joe III's father, Joe Jr., died of heart failure in Natchitoches, La., shortly 
before the game, after two weeks in intensive care. The family asked that Joe 
III not be told until game's end. The only Piston player who knew was Isiah 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about it a couple times out there," Thomas said. "He made one shot 
today, going down the lane, the shot clock running down, where he threw it real 
high in the air and it went in. We kind of looked at each other and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'Your dad threw that one in. Because you sure as hell didn't 
make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
For those familiar with Trail Blazer history, the day started in somewhat 
familiar fashion, like a sort of Oregon Brigadoon. 
</P>
<P>
Rising, as if from years of slumber, was Rip City, no less boisterous than that 
championship season of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, back from their Game 2 victory in Auburn Hills, Mich., with 
their overpowering home record, were in the driver's seat again and the local 
fans could thus walk their pet gripes. 
</P>
<P>
They arrived Sunday brandishing posters galore, like one of the U.S. map with 
an arrow pointing to Portland and the words "You Are Here." They derided CBS' 
Hubie Brown, who has fumbled Trail Blazer names; he was welcomed as Hoggie, 
Hoobie, Hubie Stockmon and Hubie Musburger. 
</P>
<P>
Get it? Nobody knows who the Trail Blazers are. Boo-hoo. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazermaniacs thought they had problems? The actual game brought real 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Portland, as expected, came out flying and grabbed an 8-2 lead. The Pistons, 
not as expected, shot their way back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons didn't have ace stopper Dennis Rodman, who sat out with his 
sprained ankle. Dumars and Vinnie Johnson were in inopportune slumps. Suddenly 
all that Bad Boy stuff looked like a lot of hype for a one-year dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the ultimate challenge for us," murmured Thomas before Game 3, while 
Johnson declined interviews and Dumars explained that the groin the Detroit 
medical staff said was fine, was hurting him. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been in a position like this for a while. We'll see how our team 
responds." 
</P>
<P>
The response was the Pistons' finest moment in their three NBA finals of 
1988-89-90, since Game 1 of the '88 series, when they beat the Lakers in the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The twin slumps of the Piston shooting guards ended in withering volleys. 
Dumars had 10 points by the end of the first quarter, when Johnson entered. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars is generally a good shooter, but Johnson is something else. It could be 
said that the Microwave's whole career is a slump, punctuated by awesome 
bursts. He shot 43% in the regular season. He was four for 25 in his last four 
games. An unplugged Microwave can stay that way for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
For those suspecting ebbing confidence, suspect again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from Brooklyn," Johnson announced later. "I'm built on confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say he didn't run away from any shots. He canned a 15-footer the 
first time he touched the ball and was off to a 15-point second quarter and a 
nine-for-13, 21-point day. 
</P>
<P>
What, Daly worry? 
</P>
<P>
"When Vinnie came into the game," Daly said later, "Isiah said to me we'd 
better not go to him right away because he's not warmed up. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Zeke, I've been coaching him seven years and he's as likely to hit 
that one as one 10 minutes down the road.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers had other problems. Bill Laimbeer kept drawing charging fouls, or 
fouls by Trail Blazers setting screens. He put two quick ones on Kevin 
Duckworth, which resulted in Ducky's quick departure and the abandonment of the 
inside game in favor of many Clyde Drexler launches, few of which went in. 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer then proceeded to draw four of Buck Williams' six fouls. Buck, the 
Trail Blazers' heart and soul, was held to 27 minutes, five points and three 
rebounds. Maybe Laimbeer prefers something else to the Duck'n'Buck Show. 
</P>
<P>
There were several things the Blazers could have said to Laimbeer: 
</P>
<P>
A) Congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
B) Nice game. 
</P>
<P>
C) No comment. 
</P>
<P>
D) He cheated. 
</P>
<P>
They went for C and D. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment on Laimbeer," Trail Blazer Coach Rick Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Laimbeer," said Williams. "What I get upset with is when he flops and 
he gets calls for it. Everybody in the world knows what an exceptional flopper 
he is. He's made it an art. But everyone knows that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Duckworth: "It's a crying shame." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons grabbed a 31-27 lead at the end of the first quarter, increased it 
to 58-51 at the half and 90-82 at the end of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
They then held Portland scoreless for the first 3:45 of the fourth quarter, 
grabbed a 16-point lead and were never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer, foolish enough to grouse out loud about the rainy local weather, 
fouled out late and left to a standing ovation of boos. 
</P>
<P>
He took a little bow. He couldn't have been happier. For the Blazermaniacs, it 
was scant consolation, but on this saddest of Oregon days, the only tiny bit 
available. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rick Adelman criticized the referees. "Incredible," he said. "It was different 
at one end than it was at the other. There's a different way some people can 
play and other people can play. That was obvious today." . . . The Trail 
Blazers reportedly believe referee Jake O'Donnel has it in for Buck Williams, 
but when asked about it, all refused comment. . . . Commendation: Isiah Thomas 
played as steady a game as he ever has in the finals, making six of his eight 
shots, scoring 21 points with eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
Their Yugo broke down: Portland guard Drazen Petrovic missed all five of his 
shots and Vinnie Johnson and Joe Dumars smoked him at every opportunity. . . . 
More bricks: Portland's Cliff Robinson went one for seven. Clyde Drexler's 
outside shot, which helped win Game 2, went back to wherever it usually is. He 
was nine for 23, one for six from three-point range.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP '90; 
</P>
<P>
IT WILL GET WORSE FOR U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FLORENCE, Italy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took only one game to confirm what many of us already knew: 
</P>
<P>
That the United States is more prepared to play host to a World Cup than to 
play in one. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side will qualify automatically in 1994, when the tournament comes to 
California and Florida and points in between. And that's a lucky break, because 
for the time being, the U.S side might be good enough to lick Guatemala or El 
Salvador or the lovely and talented Trinidad and Tobago, but beyond that, 
they've got two left feet. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the news was hardly all bad for the United States in Sunday's 5-1 World 
Cup loss to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
At least nobody was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Tony Meola did crash face-first into a goal post. Forward and 
serious scoring threat Peter Vermes did go down wailing with an injured hip. 
And midfielder Eric Wynalda did have somebody step on his toe, whereupon he 
gave the Czech a body-check and promptly was excused from playing the rest of 
the game, making Wynalda either the most foolish or most fortunate man on the 
American team. 
</P>
<P>
"We got stomped," U.S. defender Desmond Armstrong said. "But hey, it comes with 
the territory. We're here with the big boys now." 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Michael Windischmann: "Around the world, people think we can't 
play soccer. And when the score's 5-1, you understand why people think that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Now we know how it feels to be one of those countries like Egypt or Uruguay 
that draws the United States as a first-round opponent in Olympic basketball. 
The Americans went into this World Cup being told that they didn't stand a 
chance . . . and guess what? They didn't stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's not even one of the good teams. The Czechs are slow. Just wait 
until the United States has to play Italy Thursday at Rome. A calf stands a 
better chance to win a rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't going to get any easier," Paul Caligiuri said. 
</P>
<P>
It is Caligiuri whom we have to thank -- or blame -- for being here. UCLA's 
contribution to the U.S. cause is the one whose goal in Trinidad put the United 
States into the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. And Caligiuri's thing 
of beauty early in Sunday's second half gave the United States its first World 
Cup goal in 40 years -- another gem for the kid from Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the team sputtered and stalled like a broken-down Alfa Romeo. 
</P>
<P>
You would never know that you were watching the youngest and physically 
lightest specimens in the tournament. Time after time, the Americans were a 
step behind. When they went heads-up for a ball, the Czechs were always several 
inches higher. Some U.S. players, Caligiuri included, even mentioned "fatigue" 
as a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Fatigue? For a team with an average age of 24? 
</P>
<P>
The Americans also come billed as the most-educated team in the field, each of 
them having attended college. It was proved Sunday that this does not 
necessarily make them the brains of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda, the former San Diego State player from Westlake Village who turned 21 
on Saturday, used his head on the soccer ball better than he did when he 
flattened Czechoslovakia's Jozef Chovanec, who evidently had stomped on 
Wynalda's foot. For striking back in anger, Wynalda drew a red card from an 
official, suffered the indignity of being thrown out of his first World Cup 
game, and becomes ineligible for the next game as well. 
</P>
<P>
Not his greatest move, as even teammates agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any time you get a red card, it's stupid," Windischmann said. 
"Wynalda, he's younger. He has to learn. You have to wait until later to 
retaliate if you feel you must. To outright push somebody, right in front of a 
linesman, I think it's dumb, and it doesn't help us, and now he doesn't get to 
play the next game. It's just dumb." 
</P>
<P>
It began as such a lovely day, too. American flags spangled the Communale 
Stadium grandstand. Backup goalkeeper David Vanole led the U.S. procession onto 
the field with a tiny flag protruding from the top of his cap. And starting 
goalie Tony Meola spent the first 27 minutes stopping everything that came his 
way. 
</P>
<P>
After that, it turned brutto. Ugly. The Czechs averaged a goal every 10 1/2 
minutes. They had several near-goals, too. Meola flopped around like a seal. He 
actually played pretty well. He just needed three or four more arms. 
</P>
<P>
It hurt, too. "It's my dream to play professionally in Europe someday, and this 
put a big dent in it," Meola said. "It's tough to think how this must have 
looked. I mean, 5-1! That's bad, man." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing in the World Cup, and I wouldn't trade my spot with anybody," 
midfielder Tab Ramos said. "But it's difficult to swallow and forget when 
you've never taken a loss as bad as this." 
</P>
<P>
And the Italian side awaits. 
</P>
<P>
"And Italy," as Armstrong said, "is scary." 
</P>
<P>
Especially when you belong to a team that loses by four, and the sport isn't 
basketball.

RANGERS KNOCK OUT ANGELS, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Mark Langston, the key was getting ahead of hitters. For Texas right-hander 
Kevin Brown, the key was getting hit in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, Brown was later able to laugh about the third-inning line drive by 
Luis Polonia that hit him in the left temple and ricocheted into center field, 
hushing the Anaheim Stadium crowd of 44,932. Knocking him cold was the only way 
the Angels were going to knock him out of Sunday's game, so effective were his 
sinker and his poise in a five-hit, complete-game performance that led the 
Rangers to a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Although the liner knocked Brown backward and down, he wasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Not when you're dealing with a head like mine. They couldn't do any damage," 
said Brown, who missed shutting out the Angels when Dave Winfield lifted a hard 
sinker and drove it into the left-field seats for his seventh home run with one 
out in the ninth. Brown had pitched seven scoreless innings against the Angels 
last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have done more damage if they hit me in the arm or the foot," Brown 
added. "My head was a little sore, but not so bad I couldn't concentrate. . .I 
was unlucky in a way but lucky enough." 
</P>
<P>
Brown (7-4) was lucky, but he was also good enough so that the Rangers could 
strike out 12 times against Langston (4-6) and not suffer for it. In losing two 
of three in this series, the Angels lost two games to Oakland and dropped 10 
1/2 games behind in the AL West, their biggest deficit since they were 11 games 
out May 17. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also slipped back to .500, at 29-29. 
</P>
<P>
"(Langston) pitched so well. It's a shame," Winfield said. "But we have nothing 
to be ashamed or feel bad about." 
</P>
<P>
Although Brown gave up a single to Wally Joyner after Polonia's single, he 
retired 12 of the next 13 and gave up only Winfield's homer in the last 5 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to win this game so bad, nothing could get him out of there," said 
Polonia, who was relieved to hear Brown was not injured. "That guy's a pretty 
good pitcher. He's tough." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, who didn't face Brown last Monday, said he was determined to stay 
under Brown's sinker instead of giving in to the temptation of hitting down on 
it and beating it into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I got that last one, but that guy pitched a good game," Winfield said. "I've 
seen him three times, once with New York and twice here, and he's pitched three 
good games." 
</P>
<P>
Langston also pitched well, and now has 75 strikeouts -- tying him for second 
in the AL with Seattle's Erik Hanson. Boston's Roger Clemens has 88. 
</P>
<P>
He walked three and gave up only four hits in eight innings, but two of those 
hits came in the first. Former Angel Gary Pettis led off with a single, stole 
second and was tagged out on Jack Daugherty's grounder. Daugherty went to third 
on Julio Franco's double into the right-field corner and scored on Ruben 
Sierra's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Pettis figured in Langston's troubles again in the third, when he drew a 
one-out walk, stole second and scored on Sierra's two-out single to left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Gary Pettis -- what are you going to do?" Langston said. "I try to keep 
him as close as possible. Obviously, I would have loved to pick him off, but he 
got me. Gary Pettis is one of the best baserunners in the game. You just try to 
keep him as close as you can and keep your concentration on the hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Langston's concentration intensified as the game progressed. He didn't allow a 
hit in his final four innings and recorded six of his strikeouts in that span, 
throwing 140 pitches overall before giving way to Mark Eichhorn. 
</P>
<P>
"When you strike out a lot of guys, you have a tendency to make a lot of 
pitches and I still felt pretty strong," Langston said. "That's a good sign, 
that I made 140 and felt pretty comfortable. . .I've got to get ahead of 
hitters and stay ahead and make them swing at the pitches I want them to swing 
at. When I get behind and have to come in, they know I have to." 
</P>
<P>
"Probably my last six starts, excluding my last one (a four-run, 11-hit win at 
Kansas City last Tuesday) I've felt pretty good, in a groove, but the results 
just aren't there. Winning and losing is the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm starting to pitch a lot better than at the start of the 
season, and that's a good sign. I was able to get all my pitches over for 
strikes today, and that makes me more effective than if I can only get one or 
two of my pitches over." 
</P>
<P>
Brown defused an Angel scoring threat created by another unusual play in the 
first inning. Polonia had singled to center and went to third when second 
baseman Franco's relay on Pettis' throw from center field whizzed past Brown, 
who had turned toward first in response to a shout from first baseman 
Daugherty. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a situation where I didn't want to give up the run," Brown said. "It 
would (have been) a tie game. We scored a run in the first inning and you want 
to protect that. Against someone with the ability of Mark Langston, every run 
is very precious." 
</P>
<P>
Victories have been precious and rare for Langston, but he's philosophical. 
"All I can do is go out and try to keep the game close," he said. "Today, we 
just came up short." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mark Eichhorn pitched the ninth, his league-leading 29th appearance this 
season. Starting with a 2 2/3-inning stint against Toronto May 24, the 
side-armer has appeared in 11 of the Angels' last 17 games. He has four saves 
and has lowered his ERA to 1.36. 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Kent Anderson (sprained right shoulder) is eligible and ready to come 
off the disabled list today, leaving Manager Doug Rader with a personnel 
decision. Gary DiSarcina is the likely candidate to return to triple-A

position they haven't been in since they were 5-3 on April 17. . .Rader has

Reliever Greg Minton will undergo tests today to determine the amount of 
strength in his right shoulder, which "felt like it came out of the socket" 
last week and slowed his comeback from elbow surgery. Minton, 38, is lifting 
weights to strengthen the muscles in the back of the shoulder, which shows the 
wear that could be expected from more than 12 years of pitching in the major 
leagues.

"Anybody who doesn't think I'm going to come back is a fool because I'm going

that, or I'm going to be on the Olympic weightlifting team."

Third baseman Jack Howell had no problems with his left knee, which put him on 
the disabled list until Saturday. He was hitless in two at-bats and also 
walked. "I need to see more pitches, get more at bats, get that first hit to 
get back on track," he said.

WORLD CUP: CZECHOSLOVAKIA EASILY WINS FIRST-ROUND MATCH. ONCE AGAIN, CALIGIURI 
SCORES THE ONLY AMERICAN GOAL.

<P>
For those sports fans who complain that soccer does not have enough scoring, 
the United States' opening game Sunday in the World Cup against Czechoslovakia 
was made to order. 
</P>
<P>
Almost. 
</P>
<P>
Only six goals were scored in the first four games of the monthlong tournament. 
There were as many in this game. 
</P>
<P>
But it could hardly have been entertaining for the 33,266 fans at Communale 
Stadium. Quantity did not translate into quality as the United States 
contributed only one of the goals in a 5-1 loss, a score that did not do 
justice to the Czechs. 
</P>
<P>
To the United States' credit, its goal was as nifty as any that is likely to be 
scored in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Bruce Murray passed a ball through the defense to midfielder Paul 
Caligiuri, who beat his man in the midfield for a breakaway that left him 
one-on-one with goalkeeper Jan Stejskal. 
</P>
<P>
Caligiuri, the Diamond Bar native who scored the goal last November against 
Trinidad and Tobago that, for better or worse, put the United States into the 
World Cup, faked a shot that left Stejskal sprawling, then dribbled around him 
for a right-footed shot from about 12 yards out into an open net. 
</P>
<P>
That did little to change the complexion of the game. The United States was 
still trailing, 3-1, with only 30 minutes remaining. But it might have startled 
the London bookmakers, who were laying long odds against the United States even 
scoring a goal in its three first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
The bookmakers, however, still look pretty good in making the United States the 
longest shot of the 24 teams to win the World Cup. Pick a number. The odds have 
ranged between 600-1 to 50,000-1. 
</P>
<P>
"The frustrating thing about it is that we've made the oddsmakers look like 
kings," U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola said. 
</P>
<P>
They also made the Czechs look like kings, although they might prefer a more 
egalitarian description. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia is a democratic country now, having held its first free election 
last week in almost half a century. The Czech players dedicated this game to 
Vaclav Havel, the playwright-philosopher turned president. 
</P>
<P>
For the U.S. players, all of whom have attended college, this game should have 
brought to mind another literary figure, Dante Alighieri. He wrote his poem, 
"Dante's Inferno," after being exiled from his native Florence in 1302 for his 
political convictions. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechs put the U.S. players through all 12 rings of hell. They were not as 
fast, as quick, as strong, as skilled or as experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Retaliating because Jozef Chovanec stepped on his foot, midfielder Eric Wynalda 
of Westlake Village put him on the ground with a shove in the back. The foul 
was spotted by Swiss referee Kurt Roethlisberger, who ejected him from the game 
with a red card. 
</P>
<P>
With 38 minutes remaining, the United States, already down, 3-0, had to play 
with only 10 men because players who have been disqualified cannot be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you play 10 men down, it's a problem," Caligiuri said. 
</P>
<P>
He meant one man down. It just looked like 10. 
</P>
<P>
For the Czechs, it was target practice. They took 23 shots, eight more than 
Cameroon and Argentina combined for in Friday's opening game. The United States 
had seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
"When there were about 10 minutes left, I was thinking, 'C'mon, blow the 
whistle,' " defender Desmond Armstrong said. "They were just doing things at 
will, to the point that it seemed like they could score a goal whenever they 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wonders how it could get any worse for the United States has only to 
wait until Thursday night, when it plays Italy in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The luckiest American might be Wynalda, who automatically received a one-game 
suspension with the red card. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping for at least a tie," Caligiuri said, "and we lose, 5-1, against 
a team that . . ." He did not have to finish the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Italy is good," he said, a deliberate understatement. 
</P>
<P>
Because the winner of Group A, which also includes Italy's 1-0 Saturday victim, 
Austria, might be determined by goal differential, the Italians cannot afford 
to let up against the United States because of the Czechs' barrage. 
</P>
<P>
It began in the 26th minute, when center-forward Tomas Skuhravy beat the United 
States' John Stollmeyer to ball in the midfield and passed to Lubomir Moravcik, 
who gave the ball back to Skuhravy in the penalty area on a give-and-go. 
</P>
<P>
Meola tried to cut down the angle, saying later that he had a better chance to 
save this one than any of the others, but Skuhravy beat him with a shot into 
the center of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was apparent early that the U.S. players were outclassed in 
virtually every aspect of the game, they did not appear to let it discourage 
them until the 40th minute, when sweeper Mike Windischmann fouled Ivan Hasek in 
the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
That set up a penalty kick by Michal Bilek, who converted with a hard shot into 
the left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see the replay, but I guess I nicked him (Hasek) in some way," 
Windischmann said. 
</P>
<P>
It cost the United States not only a goal but also one of its most reliable 
players in Windischmann, who was present only in body for the remainder of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"He was unnerved after the penalty kick," U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said. 
"Obviously, that weighed heavy on his conscience." 
</P>
<P>
As the captain, Windischmann's attitude spread through the team. 
</P>
<P>
Many said they felt defeated when they entered the locker room at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
It would get worse. Five minutes into the second half, Meola dived face-first 
into the right post while making a save. Still groggy, Meola was not able to 
get in front of Hasek's header moments later after a corner kick that gave the 
Czechs a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Caligiuri's goal temporarily revived the Americans' spirits, but Skuhravy's 
second goal after another corner kick in the 79th minute buried them. Milan 
Luhovy tossed on the dirt with another goal in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Only one minute earlier, Meola had prevented another Czech score when he saved 
a penalty kick by Bilek after defender Steve Trittschuh's foul against Hasek in 
the box. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of booming the penalty kick, Bilek tried to float it past Meola. The 
U.S. goalkeeper, still suffering from a headache after his crash into the post, 
thought Bilek was trying to embarrass him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling the guy was going to try to do me somehow," Meola said. "Maybe 
he learned his lesson." 
</P>
<P>
If so, it was the only one the United States taught the Czechs. 
</P>
<P>
"They played very fair and with determination," Czech Coach Josef Venglos said. 
"But maybe our team showed better experience. The Italian team and the Austrian 
team are much stronger than our opponent today." 
</P>
<P>
That is hardly news to Gansler, who acknowledged that his team is inferior to 
the next two opponents, Italy Thursday and Austria on June 19, but refused to 
wave a white flag. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there a gulf?" he said in response to a question. "Yes. But it's not as 
great as some of you might think." 
</P>
<P>
His greatest challenge at this World Cup will be to convince his team of that 
before Thursday.

MORNING BRIEFING: AGASSI EVOKES NO ECSTASY FOR FASHION CRITIC 
</P>

Philippe Chatrier, president of the French tennis federation, said during the 
French Open that he would like to ban the colorful clothes worn by Andre 
Agassi, among others, in favor of the traditional white that is worn at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi called the federation members "bozos," and Thomas Bonk of The Times 
called Chatrier "Agassi's Mr. Blackwell." 
</P>
<P>
What does the real Mr. Blackwell think of Agassi's wardrobe? 
</P>
<P>
In the February issue of Tennis magazine, the well-known fashion critic said of 
Agassi: "Looks like he missed the last train to Woodstock. With neon-colored 
spandex worn under denim-look shorts, he's tennis' flower child gone to seed." 
</P>
<P>
Add fashion: Other opinions from Mr. Blackwell: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Martina Navratilova: "Truly frightening. In her leather-appliqued skirts 
and '70s wire-rim eyeglasses, she's the Tootsie of tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Stefan Edberg: "Ruins his matinee-idol looks with baggy tie-dyed trash. 
Dresses for surfing, not serving." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Zina Garrison: "Foghorns are not this loud." 
</P>
<P>
Last add fashion: Mr. Blackwell actually had good things to say about the 
fashion sense of several players, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gabriela Sabatini: "Drop-dead dazzling, period." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris Evert: "Feminine perfection. The queen of American tennis has a 
romantic, stylish touch. She also has one of the best senses of on-court color 
of any player, male or female." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: How many former UCLA players are playing in the major leagues? 
</P>
<P>
Lips are sealed: Sorcerers in Cameroon who publicly predicted a 1-0 victory for 
the Indomitable Lions over Argentina in the opening game of the World Cup 
soccer tournament refused to foretell the outcome of Cameroon's next game, 
Thursday against Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute: Mickey Hatcher of the Dodgers, asked by Sport magazine to name 
his favorite films, said: "Lethal Weapon I and II. They were great 
action-packed films filled with blood and guts." 
</P>
<P>
And his least favorite? 
</P>
<P>
"All of the Friday the 13th movies. I wish I could put an end to all that 
nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
What are the chances?: Asked about her 5-month-old son, Marcus Gastineau, whose 
father is former New York Jet Mark Gastineau, actress Brigitte Nielsen told 
Newsweek: "He's a very big boy, very strong, but I won't guide him in one 
direction. I can't say he'll be a football player. He may be a computer 
scientist." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Seven -- Todd Zeile of the St. Louis Cardinals, Tim Leary of the 
New York Yankees, Dave Schmidt of the Montreal Expos, Mike Gallego of the 
Oakland Athletics, Don Slaught of the Pittsburgh Pirates, Shane Mack of the 
Minnesota Twins and Matt Young of the Seattle Mariners.

Quotebook: Oklahoma State Coach Gary Ward, whose team averaged almost 12 runs 
and batted .390 in the College World Series before losing to Georgia, 2-1, in 
the championship game: "When you only score one and get five hits, you look at 
your offense and say, 'Hey, where are the bats? Where's the beef?' " JERRY

<P>
It took Paul Gonzales six years to get a shot at a world title after he was 
voted the outstanding fighter of the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' bid for the International Boxing Federation bantamweight championship 
ended unsuccessfully at 30 seconds of the second round Sunday at the El Paso 
County Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
However, it wasn't until 15 minutes later that the ring announcer finally 
declared champion Orlando Canizales the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Barry Yeats had been advised by Dr. Paris Bransford to stop the fight 
because of a cut in Gonzales' left eyelid. 
</P>
<P>
The question was whether there had been a head butt, which would have resulted 
in the bout being called a technical draw. 
</P>
<P>
Yeats said that a right hand had caused the cut 30 seconds into the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
But the ringside IBF and Texas Athletic Commission officials decided to huddle 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales got the news that he was officially the loser while being interviewed 
by NBC announcers Marv Albert and Ferdie Pacheco. 
</P>
<P>
"That was ridiculous," said Gonzales, insisting he was the victim of a head 
butt. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't lose to Canizales. I lost to a butt. He butted me in our first fight, 
too. He came out throwing punches, but he was using his head at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
None of the four angles of the NBC replay indicated a head butt. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul's reaction reminded me of Muhammad Ali's after the anchor punch against 
Sonny Liston in Lewiston, Maine," Pacheco said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he watched the film of the fight, Ali said he couldn't see the punch 
because it was toofast." 
</P>
<P>
Canizales was positive that a punch had done the damage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a clean right hand over the top," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, the champion from Laredo, Tex., came out fast in a manner prescribed 
by manager Bob Spagnola. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost the first fight because Orlando wasn't aggressive enough," Spagnola 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he tried those same tactics again, it would have been a long afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Yeats first called Bransford into the ring to look at the cut after 
only 37 seconds of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales was permitted to keep fighting and counterpunched decently, but the 
round belonged to Canizales. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerman Chuck Bodak was able to stop the bleeding between rounds, but the cut 
was re-opened after only 10 seconds of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Canizales, who weighed in at the bantamweight limit of 118 pounds, improved to 
25-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, 117 pounds, is 14-2.

The 46 toilets finally have arrived from the plant in Ohio, meaning the El Paso 
Diablos of the double-A Texas League will move into the new Cohen Center either 
tonight or Tuesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The switch to the modern 10,000-seat ballpark from 66-year-old Dudley Field 
signifies progress for the club, but also the end of one of the most colorful 
eras in minor league baseball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Dudley Field will be torn down and the neighboring El Paso Zoo will 
be expanded. But, really, that's what Dudley Field has been since 1924. A zoo. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Two hundred eight home runs were hit one season at Dudley, where the elevation 
is 3,695 feet and the power alleys are 365 feet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
On a Saturday night in 1985, El Paso beat Beaumont, 35-21. The next day, 
Beaumont scored nine runs in the first inning and won, 20-13. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A storm hit El Paso one summer evening. It rained everywhere but at Dudley 
Field. A nickname was born. Dudley Dome. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Paul Strezlin, a junior high school principal, is the only public address 
announcer ever to be thrown out of two games. The last time it was for playing 
a tape of Linda Ronstadt's "I've Been Cheated," after a call he didn't like. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Ten-Cent Hot Dog Night was the promotion Sunday. Last year, 3,000 fans devoured 
16,000 dogs before the supply ran out in the seventh inning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
After every Diablo home run, a hat is passed around in the stands. The lucky 
batter will collect an average of $50. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh inning Saturday night against Wichita, Jesus Alfaro cleared the 
right-field fence with a game-tying homer. "That's a $100 homer," predicted 
Rick Cantu of the El Paso Times in the press box. "He's been here more than six 
years and he's very popular." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro, a designated hitter, started passing the hat behind the Diablos' 
dugout. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The longest home run anybody here can remember is a shot by Darryl Strawberry 
of the Jackson Mets that was estimated at 500 feet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sign at the souvenir stand: "Advice, 25 cents." . . . 
</P>
<P>
There are 52 signs gracing the outfield fences, advertising malls, sheet metal 
works, banks, restaurants, radio stations, newspapers and the U.S. Army. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The winning run Saturday was set up when the Diablos' Sandy Guerrero tagged up 
from first all the way to third. He did this while Wichita center fielder Mike 
Humphreys was being revived by trainers on the terrace in center field after 
making a spectacular catch and crashing into the wall. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among owner Jim Paul's many promotions is a night when a fan manages the team. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Only three of the eight teams in the Texas League are located in Texas, and the 
league office is in Arkansas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The most famous person in uniform this series was Wichita pitching coach Jon 
Matlack. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cohen Center is named after Andy and Syd Cohen, who went from the El Paso 
sandlots to the major leagues. Syd was the last man to strike out Babe Ruth. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Crowds are expected to rise from the current average of 1,550 at Dudley Field 
to 4,000 at Cohen Center, but, somehow, it just won't be the same. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ferdie Pacheco of NBC rates the five heavyweights getting the most 
attention: 1. Mike Tyson, 2. Evander Holyfield, 3. Buster Douglas, 4. Razor 
Ruddock, 5. George Foreman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Holyfield will beat Douglas," Pacheco said. "He's got superior athletic 
ability and he has the confidence that only an unblemished record brings you."

<P>
There's a possibility that a Laker-Clipper game will be shown as part of NBC's 
regular-season NBA package. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Marv Albert looks for the New York Knicks to keep Coach Stu Jackson, but make 
at least one important trade. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Stay In School: This may be remembered as the year that the players who could 
have gone first in the NBA and major league baseball drafts -- Larry Johnson 
and Todd Van Poppel -- instead decided to continue their education. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Average number of runs scored by winning teams in the National League Friday 
was 13. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure if Monica Seles' grunts or shots are more disconcerting to her 
opponents.

The Mazda Senior Tournament Players Championship is one of only four 72-hole 
tournaments scheduled on the PGA tour for the older golfers. 
</P>
<P>
For all intents and purposes, the event over the Dearborn Country Club course 
was only slightly longer than the normal 54-hole senior tournaments. This one 
lasted about 57 holes. 
</P>
<P>
It was on the third hole of the final round Sunday that Jack Nicklaus 
essentially wrapped up his second victory in three tries with the 50-and-over 
group. Nicklaus had a three-shot lead after 54 holes and when he eagled No. 3 
to go 21 under, it seemed obvious he was going to win. 
</P>
<P>
The only question was how many senior records he would break. His second 
consecutive eight-under 64 gave him a 261 total, 27 under par. The old record 
was 25 under by Orville Moody in the 1988 Vintage at Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that Lee Trevino didn't play well. He saved a birdie on No. 3 with a 
six-footer after Nicklaus' eight-footer gave him a four-shot lead. Trevino shot 
a 32 on the front nine and lost ground. Trevino was never any closer. He 
finished with a five-under 67 and was 21 under for the tournament. 
Nevertheless, he was a loser by six shots. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the final round, it was apparent that it was a two-man show. It 
didn't keep an estimated 25,000 fans, on a windy, overcast day, from flocking 
to the course. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jack and Lee show up," Chi Chi Rodriguez said, "the rest of us are 
playing for third place." 
</P>
<P>
There was no winner in the battle for third. Jim Dent and Charles Coody 
finished in a tie at 272, 16 under par. Dent shot a 66, Coody a 68. 
</P>
<P>
Next week at Syracuse, they won't have to contend with Nicklaus or Trevino. 
Trevino is taking the week off, but Nicklaus, buoyed by another senior victory, 
is playing in the U.S. Open at Chicago. After a similar performance in the 
Traditions, Nicklaus was in contention in the Masters until the last nine 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
Is golf's living legend ready to challenge the youngsters? 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, who didn't think he could win the Masters, thinks he can win the Open. 
And Nicklaus likes his chances, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I will be hitting the same five- and six-irons into the greens I hit 
here," he said. "The greens figure to be similar, maybe a little faster in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"The Traditions got me ready for the Masters and I think the same will be true 
for the Open. I don't think I ever putted for four days any better than I did 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hole 20-footers, but I sure holed them here. I think I'm ready for 
Medinah." 
</P>
<P>
The hole that set the tempo for the Nicklaus blitz was the 455-yard, par-5 
third. It played even shorter, because the pin was in front and a brisk wind 
was helping the golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus hit his drive 305 yards. He then hit a nine-iron just eight feet from 
the flag. He sank the putt and with it any hopes the rest of the field had that 
he might falter. 
</P>
<P>
"I have high expectations for Jack in the Open," Trevino said. "He's ready. The 
last time I finished 21 under was at New Orleans in 1973 and I won by eight 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I shot a 32 on the front side and lost a stroke. I'm still putting well, but 
I've never seen Jack putt any better. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jack sank the eagle putt on No. 3, even though I made my birdie, I was 
pretty sure there would be no chance to beat him." 
</P>
<P>
The winner's share of $150,000, his biggest payoff ever gave Nicklaus $295,000 
in just three events. Only three times in his fabulous career on the regular 
PGA did he exceed that amount in a whole year. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, who has won five tournaments, leads the seniors' money list with 
$480,633 in 12 tournaments. Nicklaus in three has moved into second place. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus is scheduled to play in only one other senior event, the Open in New 
Jersey June 28-July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean I won't play in others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I won't play the senior tour full time until I'm convinced I can't compete 
with the juniors. But I don't see why I can't reach my goal of winning a 
tournament on each tour." 
</P>
<P>
"Playing like this with my old friends gives me the confidence I need to go 
after the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"For now, the Open, the PGA and the British Open are the only tournaments on my 
schedule. There will be others." 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Orville Moody finished 15 shots behind Nicklaus. Arnold 
Palmer did even worse, beating par by only one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Palmer's play, the phenomenon of Arnie's Army continues. He started the 
day 18 shots behind, but had a huge gallery that cheered his every shot. When 
he birdied the final hole it sounded as if he'd won the tournament.

RUSTY WALLACE WINS AGAIN ON THE ROAD; 
</P>
<P>
MOTOR RACING: THE 300-KILOMETER EVENT AT SEARS POINT IS FILLED WITH MISHAPS, 
FLAT TIRES AND YELLOW FLAGS.

<P>
Stock car driver Rusty Wallace's Glenda was a winner once again Sunday in a 
300-kilometer stock car race at Sears Point International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, 33, named his road racing car Glenda after he won his first race in 
the specially designed Pontiac at Watkins Glen in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He won two more road races at Riverside before the track was razed and has won 
five of seven road races on the NASCAR circuit over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace earned $69,100 when he took the checkered flag on the 74th lap, 
surviving a day of mishaps, flat tires and yellow flags on the 2.52-mile course 
in the Sonoma Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, Wallace finished in the midst of the ninth caution period of the day 
as the twisting, 11-turn course took its toll. Only 20 drivers among a field of 
44 finished the race. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Martin, driving a Ford, finished second but moved into the lead of the 
Winston Cup standings when series leader Morgan Shepherd dropped out of the 
race with only four laps remaining while in seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Rudd, who won last year's race by 0.05 seconds over Wallace, finished 
third in front of a crowd estimated at 80,000. Rudd made three unscheduled pit 
stops with three flat tires and felt fortunate to finish third. 
</P>
<P>
"Any race strategy was dictated by the tire situation today," Rudd said. "There 
was a lot of debris on the course, and I was glad to see all those yellows 
(flags)." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace gained his first lead on the 23rd lap, then took it for good on the 
60th lap after a minor bumping incident with Rudd on Turn 6. The race was 
yellow-flagged on the 73rd lap until its conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Wallace credited his conservative driving style and an overnight 
change of shock absorber for his second victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to do my passing on the long straightaways and drove cautiously 
throughout the day," Wallace said. "Sometimes, I wonder how I do it. I don't 
really know why I'm so successful on a road course. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing smooth about me on a road course. Whenever I try to drive 
smoothly, I'm too slow. Sometimes, I think I need to do things differently." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace did make one significant change. He ordered his crew to change his 
car's shock system after qualifying a disappointing 11th on Friday. The move 
paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"I was overly aggressive at qualifying, and did so poorly that I was down on 
myself a little," he said. "I thought Martin and Rudd had me beat last year 
because of the shocks they were running, so I decided last night to take a shot 
at it and changed the shocks." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who took the series lead with 1,800 points, was in fifth with five laps 
remaining but made up ground in a hurry to finish second. He was hoping for 
another photo finish to duplicate last year's battle between Wallace and Rudd, 
but the yellow flag prevented any last-second excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd make a run at Rusty and everyone would get excited," Martin 
said. "But the last caution flag ended any thoughts of that. It feels nice to 
be the leader, but there's still a long, long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd, bidding to win his first Winston Cup title, finished 29th. Shepherd 
has 1,738 points going into next weekend's Miller 500 at Pocono, Pa. Wallace 
moved into third place with 1,688 points.

ERROR HELPS SENNA WIN CANADIAN GRAND PRIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ayrton Senna of Brazil, benefitting from teammate Gerhard Berger's mistake at 
the start, drove to an easy victory Sunday over countryman Nelson Piquet in the 
Canadian Grand Prix at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Senna's McLaren-Honda averaged 111.946 m.p.h. for 70 laps on the 2.73-mile 
circuit, finishing 10.497 seconds ahead of Piquet's Benneton-Ford. It was 
Senna's third victory in five Formula One races this season. 
</P>
<P>
Seena also increased his lead in the driver point standings to 31-19 over 
Berger, who was assessed a one-minute penalty for jumping the green light at 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't gain any advantage from my overeager start, but I did anticipate the 
green light," Berger admitted. 
</P>
<P>
With Berger hopelessly in arrears and no other team capable of keeping pace, 
Senna merely had to avoid trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very tough race," Senna said, "because the track surface was wet and 
dirty off (the racing) line and first gear broke after I stopped to change 
tires." 
</P>
<P>
Berger's car was allowed to continue, and it was actually the first car to take 
the checkered flag. Berger jumped up to fourth by putting up the fastest lap of 
the race, 120.344 m.p.h. on the 70th lap. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, 30, led 67 laps in notching the 23rd victory of his career. He 
relinquished the lead only once when he pitted to change tires because the 
track had dried after being wet from a morning rain. 
</P>
<P>
The drying track was a puzzle to some of the drivers. Thierry Boutsen of 
Belgium, last year's winner, spun his Williams Renault on the 19th lap as he 
hit a wet spot while trying to overtake Alain Prost. "I was behind Prost and 
losing a lot of time on Senna, and my car was much better than Prost," Boutsen 
said, "so I saw an opportunity to overtake him. But unfortunately there was 
still a lot of water on the left-hand side, and I put my left rear tire into a 
little bit of water, and then I lost control of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Nigel Mansell's Ferrari was third, 13.385 seconds behind Senna, followed 
another 1.469 seconds back by Berger. Prost, in the other Ferrari, was fifth, 
another second behind. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth place, the last for which points are awarded, went to Derek Warwick of 
Britain, whose Lotus-Lamborghini was two laps down. 
</P>
<P>
John Heinricy drove a Chevrolet Camaro with three others to win his third 
consecutive IMSA Firestone Firehawk Endurance Championship 24-Hour street stock 
race at Watkins Glen, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Heinricy joined teammates Leighton Reese, Jeff Theodosakis, and Ken Pederson in 
the winning car. They led a Porsche 944S2 driven by Jeff Purner, John O'Steen, 
Tom Rathbun and Bill Cooper across the finish line by 67.209 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The winners averaged 76.339 m.p.h. on the 3.377-mile circuit, covering 
1,833.711 miles in 24 hours.

RIGHETTI HELPS MERRILL GET HIS FIRST WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Right after he won his first game as manager of the New York Yankees, Stump 
Merrill rushed to shake hands with an old friend -- Dave Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
It was appropriate that Righetti was the one to preserve the Yankees' 5-2 
victory over the Baltimore Orioles Sunday at Baltimore, because he and Merrill 
worked together in double-A ball at West Haven in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the perfect guy to close it out for me," Merrill said. "He started with 
me when I started my career. . . When I brought him in today, that's what went 
through my mind, that he would get the save of my first win." 
</P>
<P>
Righetti gave up one hit in the ninth inning to earn his 11th save and help the 
Yankees end an eight-game losing streak. He also appreciated the irony of the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known him for a long time and he's earned his way up here," Righetti 
said. "A lot of people are making fun of us because the Yankees aren't doing 
well and they make a change and bring in a guy by the name of Stump. But he's 
earned the job and deserves to be here." 
</P>
<P>
After Merrill took over for Bucky Dent on Wednesday, New York had lost twice to 
Boston and twice to the Orioles. To say Merrill enjoyed the victory is a vast 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we can relax and play some baseball," Merrill said. "Every time I turned 
around someone was asking me when the streak was going to end. Well, it's 
behind us." 
</P>
<P>
Merrill isn't the only person who will always remember the day. Baltimore 
shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. played in his 1,307th straight game, putting him in a 
tie for second with Everett Scott behind Lou Gehrig (2,130 games) on baseball's 
all-time list of consecutive games played. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't set out to play in this many," Ripken said. "My main goal was to just 
go out and play every day when I got to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"The most you can play is 162 and then you get four months off like everybody 
else," Ripken added. "It's a streak of consecutive years of playing every game, 
not a streak of 1,300 games." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who had been at .500 for the first time since April 24, saw their 
four-game winning streak end. Baltimore entered the game having won seven of 
eight and 11 of 15. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 3, Kansas City 2 -- Bob Welch settled down after a shaky start to win 
his sixth consecutive decision and the Athletics completed a three-game sweep 
at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals lost their sixth in a row and fell 16 games behind the American 
League West-leading Athletics. Oakland won for the fifth time in six games and 
improved to 38-17, the best record in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics again played without right fielder Jose Canseco. He is out of the 
lineup with a disk problem that is causing back pain, and team doctor Allan 
Pont said that he could not predict when Canseco will return. 
</P>
<P>
Welch (9-2) tied teammate Dave Stewart for the second-highest victory total in 
the league, one behind Boston's Roger Clemens. Welch gave up two runs on four 
hits in the first inning, but then shut out the Royals on three hits until 
Dennis Eckersley relieved with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley gave up a single to Kevin Seitzer that loaded the bases before Rey 
Palacios struck out. Eckersley got his 20th save in 20 opportunities. Welch is 
27-8 at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Minnesota 3 -- Ivan Calderon hit a two-run homer to help the White 
Sox complete their first three-game sweep at Minnesota in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Thipgen saved all three victories. The last time the White Sox swept the 
Twins in Minnesota was Sept. 25-27, 1979, at Metropolitan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago, second in the West, has won 11 of its last 15 games. Minnesota has 
lost four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon's sixth homer of the season put Chicago ahead, 2-0, in the third. The 
White Sox made it 4-0 in the fourth on Lance Johnson's RBI double and Robin 
Ventura's run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins scored twice in the eighth on a single by Jim Dwyer, his 100th career 
pinch-hit, and an RBI double by pinch-hitter Kent Hrbek with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Ozzie Guillen went three for four to increase his league-leading 
batting average to .352. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 13, Milwaukee 5 -- The Blue Jays scored 10 runs in the fourth inning at 
Milwaukee, the biggest outburst ever against the Brewers -- who suffered their 
14th loss in 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell, Junior Felix and Mookie Wilson each drove in two runs as the Blue 
Jays used seven hits, four walks and an error for the second-biggest inning in 
team history. They scored 11 against Seattle in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen quite a few games with 10- or 12-run innings, but it's something you 
don't see every day," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all gone through innings like that, so you know what the other team is 
going through. But you you don't go up there trying to make outs." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto also had the biggest previous inning against Milwaukee, scoring nine 
runs in an inning in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 4, Boston 0 -- Tom Candiotti pitched five-hit ball for 8 1/3 innings 
at Boston and the Indians ended their six-game losing streak and Boston's 
seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Candiotti (6-3) struck out two and walked one. He was going for his first 
shutout since 1987, but was replaced by Doug Jones after a double and single in 
the ninth. Jones retired two batters for his 19th save. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland scored the only run Candiotti needed in the second inning when Cory 
Snyder singled, took third on Brook Jacoby's bloop single to right-center field 
and scored when Joel Skinner grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Boston loaded the bases on an error, a single by Wade Boggs and a walk in the 
third, but Tom Brunansky ended the inning by grounding into a force play at 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Seattle 3 -- Mark Salas got his first hit in 20 at-bats, a solo home 
run that broke a 3-3 tie in the sixth-inning to help Jack Morris beat the 
Mariners at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Morris (5-7) won his third decision in a row. He gave up three runs on seven 
hits in six innings. Mike Henneman pitched the last two innings for his 15th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Salas hit his second homer of the season, connecting with two outs off Brian 
Holman (7-4). It was Salas' fourth hit of the season and first since May 6.

Go For Wand, last year's champion 2-year-old filly, atoned for her defeat in 
the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs last month by winning the $227,600 Mother 
Goose Stakes at Belmont Park Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand, ridden by Randy Romero, covered 1 1/8 miles over a fast track in 
1:48 4/5, the fastest Mother Goose since Life's Magic's in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Charon, ridden by Craig Perrett, 1 1/4 lengths back in second, 4 1/4 lengths 
ahead of Stella Madrid in the field of six, all carrying 121 pounds. Stella 
Madrid, ridden by Angel Cordero Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Bright Candles, who was coupled with Stella Madrid in the betting, was fourth 
and was followed by Danzig's Beauty and Dance Colony. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the third in four starts this year for Go For Wand, the 
Pennsylvania-bred daughter of Deputy Minister. She won $136,560, bringing her 
earnings to $932,878. 
</P>
<P>
Stella Madrid led through the first seven furlongs with Go For Wand stalking 
her. As they turned into the stretch, Go For Wand came even with the leader and 
moved away to a clear lead in midstretch. 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand returned $3.60, $2.40 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Primal scored his fourth stakes victory of the year, winning the $54,700 Coral 
Springs Handicap at Calder Race Course by 5 1/2 lengths. 
</P>

SHADDEN IS A WINNER IN CLIMAX

John Shadden said he had sailed "only three or four times" since his 1988 
Olympic bronze medal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But the Long Beach stockbroker showed he still has his touch at the helm when 
he brought Mike Campbell's Custom 52 Climax from behind with two victories 
Sunday to win the Fifties class of Ullman Sails-Washington Insurance Race Week 
at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In light but steady southerly breezes, Climax won Sunday's first race to move 
into first place ahead of David Meginnity's Santa Cruz 50 Deception, which has 
a lower handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"All we had to do (in the last race) was stay right behind Deception or, of 
course, beat her," Shadden said. "She got ahead after the start, but we were 
able to reel her in at the windward mark." 
</P>
<P>
With handicap time allowances, Lone Star III won the race, with Deception 
second and Climax third -- good enough to edge Deception by a point. But 
Shadden said his competitive instincts are now going back into the closet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be doing things like mowing the lawn," he said. "Maybe in a couple of 
months." 
</P>
<P>
Among 67 boats in seven classes, two other well-known sailors won their classes 
-- Dave Ullman in IOR-A with Don Hughes' R/P 42 Quintessence and Robbie Haines 
in IOR-B with Irv Loube's Farr 40 Bravura. 
</P>
<P>
Haines, a 1984 Olympic gold medalist, swept all five of his races. The 
one-design classes sailed six-mile windward-leeward courses off Seal Beach. 
Rich Matzinger steered David Dale-Johnson's Paleface to a solid 1-1-3-2-1 
performance to win in the J/35s. Steve and Barney Flam's Flambouyant won one 
race Sunday to rebound from successive disqualifications for premature starts 
Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
John Cazier of the Balboa Yacht Club sailed his own Buttercup to win the Schock 
35 class with 2-1-5-3-4 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Catalina 38s, the Lingle-Wilson-Lingle entry Entourage went into the 
third and last race with two wins and the title apparently locked up but was a 
few feet over the line at the gun, failed to return and was disqualified as 
Mark Noble took Escapade to the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
With 20 of the ocean-going IOR (International Offshore Rule) boats split into 
two groups, Ullman said he was pleased with the turnout of what had been a 
fading class in the United States -- some sailors preferring to sail under 
other, broader-based handicap systems. 
</P>
<P>
Ullman, on Quintessence, beat Steve Grillon, sailing Robert Kahn's Jano, in the 
last race to win the trophy.

Kenny Ly, a cherubic 4-year-old who could count to 100 and recite his ABCs, 
never saw the speeding blue-green sedan as he stepped off the curb last April 
onto a quiet San Gabriel side street. 
</P>
<P>
The front bumper of the car ripped Kenny from his mother's hand, and hurled him 
68 feet. The driver sped off, leaving behind only a shattered headlight and a 
few specks of paint embedded in the boy's jeans. Kenny was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, detectives have spent dozens of hours staking out the crime scene, 
searching the neighborhood and even debating whether hypnosis might help 
Kenny's parents recall more about the accident.

BIG SPENDERS: Sure, they love to eat out in the Bay Area (above), but when it 
comes to dining in Southern California, no one spends like people do in Orange 
County. . . . The average local household spent nearly $3,000 a year in 
restaurants and bars in 1988. That's about $730 more than in San Diego County, 
about $830 more than in Los Angeles County and a whopping $1,325 more than in 
Riverside County.

IF IT'S HOT, THEN YOU MUST BE IN SAN JUAN; 
</P>
<P>
TEMPERATURES: GEOGRAPHY AND SEASONAL FACTORS OFTEN CONSPIRE TO HEAT UP THIS 
HISTORIC COMMUNITY.

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the breeze blows out to sea and the fog and haze stay parked off the 
coast, even Death Valley can look cool compared to this mission city, a 
normally temperate community less than a mile from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Take Thanksgiving week last year, for instance: While the desert floor topped 
out the day at 82 degrees on Nov. 20, San Juan Capistrano's temperatures soared 
to 95. The locals opened windows, turned on air conditioners and swarmed to 
local watering holes, where bartenders reported doing fire-sale business on 
cold doubles. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, San Juan Capistrano registered the nation's highest recorded 
temperature, a distinction that the seaside community holds with surprising 
frequency. And as summer rolls in, residents and weather forecasters agree that 
while inland areas such as Santa Ana or Rancho Santa Margarita may register 
more record-breaking days, even the proximity of the ocean won't keep San Juan 
from racking up some blistering afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're so well known that the good Lord has paid us a little special 
attention by making us get some real hot days," said City Councilman Lawrence 
F. Buchheim, who has seen his share of warm afternoons during his 63 summers as 
a San Juan Capistrano resident. "It just adds to the pleasant feeling of living 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, tourists seem not to mind it, as they flock to the city year after 
year. The locals show few signs of annoyance , hot days notwithstanding. And 
workers at a nursery in east San Juan credit the weather with giving them 
bountiful crops. 
</P>
<P>
So if it is strikingly hot, no one is doing much complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are they doing much explaining. Neither Buchheim nor other San Juan 
residents could quite put their fingers on why the town seems to attract such 
hot days. Meteorologists are a different story, though. They attribute it to a 
precise and unusual mixture of several different factors. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among them is San Juan Capistrano's proximity to the mountains that run 
through Camp Pendleton and on up through the eastern edge of Orange County. 
These mountains whose ridges include the familiar Santiago and Modjeska peaks, 
come within a few miles of the shore as they run to the east of San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
It is also significant that while San Juan Capistrano's western border comes 
within less than a mile of the water, the city actually has no coastline, so a 
light on-shore breeze can sometimes die in Dana Point, leaving San Juan 
sweltering. 
</P>
<P>
Those geographic facts, when combined with the right wind currents, can bring 
hot, dry air bearing down on the city. 
</P>
<P>
"You have that high terrain off to your east and northeast," said Marty 
McKewon, a meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The 
Times. "Whenever there's a high-pressure system over Utah or out there to your 
east, that brings an offshore flow that pushes down into the San Juan area." 
</P>
<P>
As the breeze blows offshore, it drops air down out of the mountains, some of 
which are more than 4,000 feet high. And as that air drops, it heats up, 
gaining more than five degrees for each 1,000 feet that it plummets, McKewon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And when the breeze hits the valley on the eastern edge of San Juan Capistrano, 
the wind dies and the air bakes -- along with the people in it. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the summer of '38, it was hot for weeks," Buchheim recalled. "We had a 
September that was so hot that everyone from the east side of the valley headed 
down for the beach. It seems like the whole town just slept on the beach night 
after night." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, though, even when San Juan Capistrano shows up as the nation's hot spot, 
that can say as much about the way temperatures are reported as it does about 
the wind coming off the Santa Ana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north in Orange County, other areas sit in weather zones that can 
produce some of the same toasty effects. Anaheim Hills, for instance, lies at 
the base of the mountains, and a mild Santa Ana wind can draw waves of hot dust 
down into the area, forcing temperatures well into the uncomfortable zone. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, Anaheim Hills doesn't have a National Weather Service temperature 
station. The nearest one is in the flatlands of east Anaheim, at the 
intersection of Tustin and Miraloma avenues. So when the temperatures get 
recorded and passed along to the wire services for the evening newscast, they 
routinely miss some areas. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even the weather service's oversights can't disguise the obvious: San 
Juan Capistrano, especially on its eastern border, can be just plain hot. 
</P>
<P>
One result of the confluence of weather patterns is that San Juan can sometimes 
seem to be a city straddling two climate zones. On the town's eastern edge, 
temperatures soar in oppressive stillness. But just a few miles away, closer to 
the ocean, a light onshore breeze can keep the valley heat at bay. 
</P>
<P>
THE HEAT IS ON 
</P>
<P>
Warm air sweeps into San Juan Capistrano when high pressure systems develop to 
the east, over Arizona or Utah. That pushes air toward the ocean, causing hot, 
offshore breezes to hold ocean-cooled air off the coast. The result: San Juan, 
which otherwise boasts a mild climate, can sometimes be the unlikely holder of 
the nation's hottest-place honors. 
</P>
<P>
As dry air drops in altitude, it increases in temperature, usually adding about 
5.5 degrees Fahrenheit for every 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Take a moderately warm summer breeze, of say 75 degrees, blowing off the top of 
4,510-foot summit of Los Pinos Peak in South Orange County. By the time it 
settles into San Juan Capistrano, just a few feet above sea level, that same 
mass of air would be a scorching afternoon of nearly 100 degrees.

STREET SMART: SQUEAKY WHEEL LIKELY TO GET ACTION FROM AUTHORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
The 45-m.p.h. speed limit on Santa Ana Canyon Road is ignored. People use this 
road, which parallels the Riverside Freeway, as a bypass when the freeway gets 
clogged up. But there are children walking, joggers running, bikers, mothers 
with strollers and other pedestrians along the way. 
</P>
<P>
I use it daily and have never seen any one stopped for speeding. I would like 
to see the speeding stopped. Maybe several speed bumps would help. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Pulliam 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
Speed bumps certainly would slow the traffic down. Problem is, the bumps would 
also probably send some knucklehead and his high- 
</P>
<P>
octane GTO into a low-earth orbit. Since no one wants to give even John Glenn 
wannabes that sort of opportunity, speed bumps are probably out of the question 
for such a well- 
</P>
<P>
traveled arterial as Santa Ana Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Speed bumps are typically found in parking lots and other areas where cars 
travel at very slow speeds. Both Anaheim and Newport Beach have in recent 
months considered using speed "humps," broader slaps of concrete that can help 
slow down traffic on neighborhood streets. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, speed humps generally cannot be deployed safely on higher-speed 
roads like Santa Ana Canyon. Even at 45 m.p.h., a car might end up flying out 
of control and crash in someone's living room. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, it becomes a matter of police enforcement to keep traffic 
from regularly exceeding the speed limit on busy thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Karl Fonceca of the Anaheim police traffic division said Santa Ana Canyon 
Road is a regular problem because of its proximity to the freeway. As they spin 
off to avoid the congestion that plagues the Riverside Freeway, motorists have 
a hard time adjusting to the fact they're on a road with a 45-m.p.h. speed 
limit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fonceca said police assign officers to work the stretch of road as workloads 
permit. Several times each year, the department assigns extra officers to the 
road to conduct a selective enforcement operation, which has the effect of 
slowing things down for a time. But within weeks after the effort concludes, 
cars are back up above the speed limit, Fonceca said. 
</P>
<P>
The powers that be at police departments typically allocate their officers 
based on complaints from the community. So perhaps the most effective way to 
ensure that police traffic units patrol Santa Ana Canyon Road on a more regular 
basis is to make timely calls to the local station house. Another option is to 
advise city council members of problems. And it never hurts if your friends and 
neighbors join the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
When the signal at the T-intersection of Newport Boulevard and Crawford Canyon 
in the unincorporated northern Tustin area was first installed, it was "smart." 
Based on traffic flow, the signal timing was variable as needed. 
</P>
<P>
Now the light has become "dumb." The timing appears to be for fixed intervals, 
regardless of traffic flow. Any influence you may have in getting this light 
returned to its smart condition would be appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Krause 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
We talked to county traffic officials about the problem, and they dispatched a 
technician to check out the problem on Friday. The technician found all systems 
working, including the computer and the wire "loops" in the pavement that kick 
off the lights when cars pull up to the intersection, according to Ron Keith, 
the county's traffic signal operations supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
But the technician found that the signal was not giving a long enough green 
light for the traffic traveling north and south along Newport Boulevard. The 
signal was adjusted, which should alleviate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the biggest glitch is not with the traffic signal, but with 
ourselves. There are just too many cars traveling through that intersection 
during morning and evening rush hours, prompting a far more significant 
congestion problem than occurred when the signal was first installed just 18 
months ago, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the county is planning to add two new lanes to Newport Boulevard 
and totally rebuild the Crawford Canyon intersection beginning in October, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The additional lanes will help allow more cars get through the intersection in 
a timely manner. Moreover, the project will include new, more sensitive signal 
equipment to ensure that drivers aren't dealing with a dumb red light. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
In reference to the June 4 letter by Ute Hertel of Irvine, who begrudges 
mothers the use of car-pool lanes: Give us mothers a break! 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes we use the car-pool lanes to get a child to the doctor. And, yes, 
sometimes we take our children to Grandma's house, too. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if Ute Hertel has much experience with children, but they can 
occasionally become impatient and noisy during long car rides. Doesn't it make 
sense for safety reasons to let the mother get them to their destination 
quickly to avoid becoming distracted and causing an accident? 
</P>
<P>
My feathers are indeed a bit ruffled. If it's any comfort, the kids and I only 
use the car-pool lanes when traffic is really congested, otherwise I stay in 
the general flow lanes. Also, I am of the opinion that speeders love the 
car-pool lanes, and I prefer to stay out of their way. But if I'm stuck in 
traffic with the kids, no matter what my destination is, I will not hesitate to 
use the car-pool lanes, and I will stay within a resonable speed limit, much to 
the chagrin of the other drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Boller 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 
</P>
<P>
The "Baby on Board" set strikes back! 
</P>
<P>
For those of you who missed it, Ute Hertel argued that car-pool lanes should be 
reserved for vehicles with two people who can drive, arguing that her cats are 
just as capable of driving as babies but they don't count for the commuter 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
The law is simple: It takes two people of any age to make up a car pool and 
thus qualify a vehicle for the commuter lane. Transportation authorities have 
toyed with the idea of age limits but concluded that it would make enforcement 
of the laws a nightmare.

<P>
One man was killed and another injured when their pickup truck spun out of 
control and overturned on a freeway transition ramp early Sunday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Frausto Jr., 24, of Placentia was pronounced dead at the scene of the 
4:05 a.m. accident on the transition ramp between the eastbound Riverside and 
northbound Orange freeways, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Estrada, 25, of Anaheim, believed to have been a passenger in the silver 
1988 Toyota truck, was being treated for moderate injuries at Western Medical 
Center in Santa Ana, CHP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was believed to have been too drunk to negotiate the curving ramp 
and instead lost control of the truck, which spun around and overturned several 
times, a patrol spokesman said. Both men were thrown from the truck. Neither 
was wearing a seat belt.

DOG, POLICE SEIZE 4 AS ROBBERY SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police officer and his dog foiled a suspected robbery attempt at an Anaheim 
convenience store early Sunday and arrested four men, one of whom was bitten as 
he tried to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Andre Jimenez was on patrol with a department police dog, Falco, when 
he saw several men standing in front of an open Circle K market at 1080 W. La 
Palma Ave. and a car he deemed suspicious parked alongside the store at about 
2:10 a.m., Police Lt. John Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the men spotted the police car and began running toward their vehicle, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect, Ignacio Comonfort Ventura, 21, of Anaheim, ran to the back of the 
store and was apprehended, Cross said. Falco was sent after a second suspect, 
Raul Avila Romero, 19, of Anaheim, who ran north across La Palma Avenue, Cross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The dog caught up to Romero, bit him on the hip, knocked him to the ground and 
held him until officers could take him into custody. Romero was treated at 
Western Medical Center and then booked into the city jail facility. 
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects, Leonelo Sanchez, 22, who refused to give an address, and 
Enrique Valencis Valencia, 22, of Anaheim, tried to flee in the car at the side 
of the store, but they were caught by another officer a short distance away, 
Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
All of the suspects were booked in Anaheim Jail on suspicion of attempted 
robbery. A fifth, unidentified suspect escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Cross said no weapon was found and no valuables were believed taken from the 
store. He said it was the suspicious behavior of the men at the store's front 
and inside the parked car that caught the officer's attention and their flight 
that led him to believe that a robbery had been in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, no weapons were seen and nothing was taken from the store, Cross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Anaheim Police Department's K-9 detail uses two German shepherds 
and two malinois for night and graveyard patrols, Cross said. The dogs, paired 
with an officer/handler, also help police conduct searches for suspects and 
evidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs undergo training sessions with the handler/officer once a week.

REFUSE REUSE CATCHES FANCY OF LARGE HOTEL

About six months ago, a worker at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers hotel realized 
that recycling trash made sense economically as well as environmentally. 
</P>
<P>
He sold the idea to his bosses, and now one of the largest hotels in Orange 
County is recycling thousands of tons of trash in one of the most extensive 
programs of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do it because we wanted to save the planet Earth -- we're all aware 
of that, and we'd like to think that we're helping," said Michael Brancazio, 
purchasing director for the hotel and organizer of the program. "On the other 
hand, there's a monetary benefit for the hotel," 
</P>
<P>
When hotel maids go in guest rooms to make the beds, they also dig through the 
trash containers and collect aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
Bartenders in the hotel lounges retrieve customers' beer and soda bottles. And 
Sunday brunch servers break up the cardboard boxes that once held hundreds of 
bottles of champagne so they can be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the company expects to recycle 400 tons of refuse annually through the 
recycling program. The effort will save the company about $30,000 a year by 
cutting down the size of garbage collection and selling the recyclables to the 
disposal company. LISA MASCARO

NEW UTILITIES CHIEF BIG ON CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has hired Edward K. Aghjayan, deputy city manager of Pasadena, to 
serve as general manager of Anaheim's public utilities department. 
</P>
<P>
Aghjayan, 49, who will start work July 30, said he plans to make water 
conservation a top priority, as he did successfully in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in being a role model for water conservation, so we can set an 
example for other cities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aghjayan was one of seven finalists for the department head post. He will 
oversee operations of the combined $220-million enterprise that serves more 
than 150,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
He comes to the city with more than 20 years of experience in utilities 
management and will be paid $124,000 annually. Aghjayan replaces Gordon Hoyt, 
who retired early this year after 26 years with the city.

SKATEBOARDER DIES OF HEAD INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old skateboarder has died of injuries sustained last week when he 
fell off his skateboard while hanging onto the back of a moving car and crushed 
his skull on a shopping center driveway, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Christopher Banks, a student at Saddleback College, was pronounced dead 
about 1:30 a.m. Saturday, said a spokeswoman at Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Banks and Graeme E. Swayn, a roommate, held onto the back 
of their friend's Toyota Celica while the car towed them up a steep driveway 
leading out of the Monarch Bay Plaza shopping center. Banks' skateboard caught 
a patch of rough concrete, and he was knocked backward onto the ground. Swayn 
was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, who was not wearing a helmet, crushed his skull and slipped into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
Banks moved from Dublin, a Bay Area town near Oakland, two years ago.

CITY ENLISTS HELP ON SMITHCLIFFS ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST and LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Determined to control the development of a 10-acre oceanfront bluff, the city 
has hired a San Juan Capistrano councilman as a consultant to help it in a 
tug-of-war for building rights at the site, which borders the city near its 
northern end. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Schwartze, a San Juan Capistrano councilman who is a real estate 
consultant and former member of the Local Agency Formation Commission, will be 
paid up to $15,000 to help Laguna Beach officials prepare for a LAFCO hearing 
expected to be held in September. LAFCO is a county agency that rules on 
incorporations, annexations and spheres of influence. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, construction magnate Gary Brinderson, who owns the exclusive 
property known as Smithcliffs, hired government relations consultant and former 
Irvine Co. employee Lauren Goodman Packard for similar purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Smithcliffs, like neighboring Emerald Bay, lies in unincorporated territory, 
but the city maintains it is virtually surrounded by Laguna Beach and falls 
within the city's sphere of influence. County officials, who now have 
jurisdiction over the property, for the past year have been considering a 
proposal from Brinderson to develop 26 homes on the site. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that infuriated City Manager Kenneth C. Frank, the Irvine Ranch Water 
District in March allied itself with Brinderson, offering to supply sewer 
service that would otherwise be provided by the city. LAFCO must approve the 
sewer annexation. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of Aliso Water Management Agency, which owns water 
treatment and disposal facilities for the area, will meet this week with 
officials from the city and the Irvine Ranch district to discuss capacity 
rights to sewer lines along Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote last week, the Laguna Beach City Council reiterated that 
any development at Smithcliffs should occur only after the area is annexed to 
the city, an option already rejected by Brinderson. The issue, Frank said, "is 
of such magnitude" that hiring Schwartze -- a clear escalation in the city's 
struggle -- became necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Smithcliffs, with its gray stucco mansion and a colorful past, was purchased by 
Brinderson for a reported $15 million five years ago. It was named by Los 
Angeles oilman Lon Smith, one of the previous owners. Some neighbors, who say 
their privacy will vanish if 26 homes are built as planned, had hoped the 
property would remain a family compound. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach residents gathered 200 signatures on a petition to protest the 
development, which they say will also block views and increase traffic, and 
they welcome the city's heightened involvement. Jeannette Merrilees, whose 
McKnight Drive home backs up to the estate, said city standards would prohibit 
the grading currently being proposed for the site. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were processed in the city of Laguna Beach as it logically and 
practically should be, none of these other concerns would bother us at all 
because the city would be taking care of us," Merrilees said. "It's because the 
city is unable to put any control on this development, which is essentially in 
its lap, that we have to take our concerns to the county." 
</P>
<P>
According to Kenneth Winter, land planning manager for the county Environmental 
Management Agency, an environmental report on the project should be released 
today. Orange County Planning Commission hearings are likely to begin in 12 to 
18 weeks, he said. Providing LAFCO approves the sewer annexation, the county 
will have the last word on the development, Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
"The county decision is final unless it is appealed to the (California) Coastal 
Commission," he said. "The city has had input through the ability to comment on 
the environmental documentation." 
</P>
<P>
Brinderson Construction, which builds U.S. naval shipyards, also is the builder 
of the 14-story Brinderson Towers on MacArthur Boulevard in Irvine. LESLIE

LOS ALAMITOS WOMAN SWIMS FROM EAST TO WEST BERLIN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynne Cox of Los Alamitos swam from East to West Berlin across the River Spree 
Sunday, past white crosses marking the watery resting places of others who were 
shot dead trying to reach freedom across the once-forbidden waterway. 
</P>
<P>
East German border soldiers were seen applauding Cox at one point during her 
less-than-three-hour crossing of the river, which no one has freely entered for 
45 years. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise only a few dozen Berliners were out to watch Cox in the pouring rain. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my way of expressing support for all that has happened here in recent 
months," Cox said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin Mayor Tino Schierzina wished Cox luck when she entered the water at 
the city's Muehlendamm lock early Sunday morning wearing a bathing costume, 
goggles and cap. 
</P>
<P>
East German river patrol boats escorted the 33-year-old swimmer as she surged 
through the water to the West Berlin section of the river. 
</P>
<P>
The route of the swim took Cox within sight of the Reichstag, Berlin's pre-war 
seat of Parliament and past the oyster-shaped Congress Hall, built with U.S. 
funds in the Tiergarten. 
</P>
<P>
She completed her swim within three hours, climbing out of the water near a 
point in the river by West Berlin's Charlottenburg Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what she had done to prepare for her feat, Cox said, "Every day I train 
for two hours, jogging and doing weight lifting." 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday's swim also represented months of effort by Cox to contact hundreds 
of people to get permission for the swim. She obtained a final go-ahead three 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who first made headlines when she swam across the Bering Strait between 
Alaska and the Soviet Union, said she planned to remain in Berlin a few days 
longer.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL;

<P>
SCHWABE HOPES HIS NEW OUTLOOK BRINGS ONE-WAY TICKET TO MAJORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Schwabe has a new attitude about his baseball career this season. Schwabe, 
pitching for Detroit's triple-A team in Toledo, used to spend his time watching 
the Tigers and worrying about his career. 
</P>
<P>
But Schwabe, a 25-year-old right-hander, has a new outlook thanks to an 
off-season marriage, a child, and almost two months in the major leagues last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to look at baseball as playing, then going out afterwards and having 
fun," he said. "Now I think of it more as a career than a job. I used to always 
worry and watch what was happening to the Tigers. Now I realize I just have to 
do my job and put up some numbers so at least I can get a chance in September 
if nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
Schwabe's biggest boost has been his versatility on the mound. He has been used 
as a starter as well as a middle and closing reliever. He's maintained all 
three roles since he pitched at Tustin High School in 1983. He pitched at 
Rancho Santiago in 1985 and 1986 then went to Arizona State for a year before 
being drafted by the Tigers and signing with the club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing new to me," Schwabe said of his roles. "Seems like I've always 
done it." 
</P>
<P>
Schwabe, 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds, throws sidearm with a sinking fastball, a 
slider and a forkball. 
</P>
<P>
He has a 4-1 record with 3.04 earned-run average in 22 games this season. He 
has made two starts, has two saves, and struck out 34 and walked 11 for 
last-place Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
He has come back from an arm injury he suffered during spring training that 
kept him out a week. But Schwabe has completed his rehabilitation and is ready 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I didn't tell anyone I was hurt," Schwabe said. "Then it really 
started to bother me. They asked me to pitch the other night and I figured I'd 
fire it up and see how I feel. I had pretty good stuff but hurt the next 
morning. Now I need about one more day and I'll be ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Schwabe was pitching for London, Ontario, the Tigers' double-A team, 
when he was called up to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
His major league memories include playing in the first baseball game at the 
Toronto SkyDome and leaping up against the famed 37-foot left-field fence known 
as the "Green Monster" in Boston's Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
He also remembers giving up home runs to Dave Parker, Chili Davis and Junior 
Felix and spending about $2,000 to upgrade his wardrobe to fit in with the 
Tigers' rules. 
</P>
<P>
He had four starts in 13 games, finishing 2-4 with a 6.04 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
But now he's in Toledo, trying to get the attention of the Tigers again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one of those big-prospect players," Schwabe said. "I don't throw hard 
enough. We're all just waiting here but it's really not a bad place. Being a 
Mud Hen in Toledo is almost like being a celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia: Last week The Times reported that Marc Newfield of Marina High School 
was the third Orange County high school player to be taken in the first round 
since the draft started in 1965. Newfield was taken as the sixth pick overall 
by the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Loara basketball Coach Jerry Halpin called and pointed out that The Times 
missed one. Well, the fact is, we missed several. What other Orange County 
players were drafted in the first round out of high school? 
</P>
<P>
Still around: Back in 1986, Rancho Santiago College came within a game of 
winning the state community college baseball title. These days, three other 
members of the team besides Schwabe are still in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Shiflett was another right-handed starter for Rancho Santiago. He pitched 
for Tulsa, the Rangers' Class AA team. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Gonzalez, the Dons' first baseman in 1986, has made it out of Class-A 
ball after three seasons. Gonzalez is playing for Williamsport, the Mariners' 
Class-AA team in the Eastern League. Gonzalez won the triple crown last season 
for San Bernardino in the California League. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Scarsone, second baseman for the Dons in 1986, is playing shortstop for 
the Phillies' Class-A team in Clearwater, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Halpin called about Steve Buechele of the Texas Rangers, the 
former Servite High School standout, who was taken in the first round in 1979 
by the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Others on the list include Kennedy High School's Alan Bannister (Angels, 1969), 
La Quinta's Brian Vernoy (Cubs, 1972), Servite's Dwayne Peltier (Pirates, 
1972), and Santa Ana Valley's Garry Templeton (Cardinals, 1974), Sonora's Brian 
Greer (Padres, 1977), and Ocean View's David Holdridge (Angels, 1987).

MARINA'S NEWFIELD SIGNS CONTRACT WITH THE MARINERS

<P>
Marc Newfield of Marina High School said on Sunday that he has signed a 
contract with the Seattle Mariners, but refused to disclose his signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Newfield, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound first baseman, was drafted sixth overall by the 
Mariners in the free agent amateur draft last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Because Newfield is only 17, his parents, Richard and Dee, signed the contract 
with him. Players under age 18 must have parents' signatures. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom said she doesn't want me to announce my (signing) bonus yet," Newfield 
said. The sixth pick in last year's draft, Paul Coleman of Frankston, Tex., 
received a $160,000 signing bonus from the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Newfield will report next week to the Mariners' rookie camp in Tempe, Ariz. He 
said he will likely end up playing for the Mariners' Class-A team in 
Bellingham, Wash. He graduates from Marina June 14. 
</P>
<P>
Newfield, who bats right-handed, hit .467 this season with six homers, eight 
doubles and 20 runs batted in while helping Marina to the Southern Section 5-A 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Mariners' scout Ken Compton also announced the signing of two other local 
players -- pitcher John Cummings and second baseman Bret Boone. Both are from 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings, a left-handed pitcher from Canyon High School, was an eighth-round 
choice and will report to Bellingham. Boone, a fifth-round pick from El Dorado 
High School, will be assigned to Peninsula, Va., Seattle's Class-A team in the 
Carolina League.

MAN SHOT NEAR VAN NUYS AIRPORT

<TEXT>
<P>
An argument over a minor traffic accident in the parking lot of a restaurant 
near Van Nuys Airport escalated into a shooting this morning that left one man 
injured. Los Angeles police were seeking the suspected gunman, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Kingsberry, 28, of Los Angeles was shot twice in the stomach and taken to 
an undisclosed hospital where he was in serious but stable condition, Sgt. 
Dallas Gibson said. An unidentified man is being sought in the 2 a.m. shooting 
in the parking lot of the 94th Aero Squadron restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred as the restaurant was closing and the two men's cars 
apparently were involved in a minor accident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dispute over a traffic accident and, while they were arguing, shots 
were fired," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooter fled in his car. Though several patrons were leaving the restaurant 
at the time, no one could provide police with a description of the gunman or 
his car.

COURT STRIKES DOWN NEW FLAG LAW;

The Supreme Court today struck down a new federal law that outlaws burning the 
American flag. "Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that 
makes this emblem so revered," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The court's 5-4 decision in the flag case indicated the divisiveness of the 
emotional issue. The ruling is certain to touch off a political battle in 
Congress to pass a constitutional amendment protecting the flag from 
desecration. 
</P>
<P>
In a split identical to a ruling last year on the flag-burning issue, the 
justices said the Flag Protection Act of 1989 violates freedom of expression 
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Writing for the 
majority, Justice William J. Brennan called it a "bedrock" constitutional 
guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said he would intensify his efforts to win approval of a 
constitutional amendment banning flag-burning. "Some of us said ahead of time 
that the legislative approach would not be upheld. Apparently, the court 
decided that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a Rose Garden ceremony honoring drug-free schools, 
Bush said he would "continue to press for what I strongly believe is in the 
public interest." 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders had said that if the law were declared invalid, they 
would move quickly for votes in the House and Senate on a constitutional 
amendment to protect Old Glory from burning or desecration. 
</P>
<P>
That move is expected to inject the issue into this fall's congressional and 
state legislative campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
A constitutional amendment would require approval by two-thirds of the members 
of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38 state legislatures. The 
First Amendment has not been altered in 199 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive to many," 
Brennan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But, quoting from the court's earlier ruling, he said, "If there is a bedrock 
principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not 
prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself 
offensive or disagreeable." 
</P>
<P>
Brennan noted that the government has said there is a national consensus in 
favor of banning flag burning. "Even assuming such a consensus exists, any 
suggestion that the government's interest in suppressing speech becomes more 
weighty as popular opposition to that speech grows is foreign to the First 
Amendment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, said the government has a 
legitimate interest in banning flag burning. 
</P>
<P>
"The flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty, equality and tolerance -- 
ideas that Americans have passionately defended and debated throughout our 
history," he said. "The flag embodies the spirit of our national commitment to 
those ideals." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 case, the court struck down a Texas law banning flag burning. It 
was that year-old opinion that prompted Congress to approve the federal law 
declared unconstitutional today.

A pickup truck traveling on the Costa Mesa Freeway early today was riddled with 
gunfire from another vehicle for no apparent reason, California Highway Patrol 
officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, Sinarta Bangun, 28, of Anaheim was not injured in the 
2:15 a.m. attack on the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway just north of the Garden 
Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Bangun's truck was struck five times, with three bullets striking the rear 
tailgate, another bullet hitting the right side of the cab and the fifth round 
slamming through the rear window, missing the driver by about an inch, CHP 
spokeswoman Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bangun was unable to provide officers with a description of the vehicle, nor an 
explanation on why the shooting might have happened. Angel said Bangun told 
police only that the rifle shots were fired from a vehicle behind him and that 
"he couldn't see anything." 
</P>
<P>
The case has been turned over to the Orange County Sheriff's Department for 
investigation.

FIRST VISIT TO WHITE HOUSE BY E. GERMAN LEADER

President Bush extended the first White House welcome ever to a leader of East 
Germany today in a meeting he said dramatizes the "magnificent changes" 
sweeping Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, who came to office after free elections in 
March in what was once a hard-line Communist state, heads a government that is 
expected to make way soon for a single Germany, uniting East and West. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Sunday he was eager to talk with de Maiziere "about his vision as to 
the postwar Europe, post-German unification Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The President posed for photographs with his visitor on the steps overlooking 
the White House Rose Garden, then ushered him into the Oval Office. The two 
leaders planned expanded talks in the Cabinet Room and lunch in the White House 
family quarters. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere is not only the first leader of the German Democratic Republic to 
visit the White House, he is almost certainly the last. 
</P>
<P>
The two Germanys are moving ahead next month with monetary union on a footing 
that will provide massive subsidies from prosperous West Germany for the 
financially strapped East.

COURT UPHOLDS U.S. CONTROL OF GUARD TROOPS

The Supreme Court ruled today the federal government may order state National 
Guard troops to take part in peacetime training abroad without a governor's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
In a case that revived a controversy from the 1988 presidential campaign, the 
justices unanimously upheld a 1986 federal law challenged by Gov. Rudy Perpich 
of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The law was challenged previously by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, 
the defeated 1988 Democratic presidential candidate who opposed sending 
National Guard troops to train in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressional power to call forth the militia may in appropriate cases 
supplement its broader power to raise armies and provide for the common defense 
and general welfare, but it does not limit those powers," Justice John Paul 
Stevens wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis in 1988 denounced the Reagan Administration for what he called a 
"failed and illegal" policy of supporting Nicaraguan Contra rebels. He said 
sending National Guard troops to the region was an attempt to intimidate 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department had said Dukakis' position was "a dagger aimed at the 
heart of national defense." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Perpich has not criticized Reagan or Bush Administration foreign 
policy. Instead, he said the issue is one of states' rights, and argued that 
the Constitution gives states veto power over peacetime training missions for 
National Guard members. 
</P>
<P>
Perpich did not object when 12 members of a Minnesota National Guard public 
relations unit happened to be training in Panama last December when U.S. forces 
invaded to capture Gen. Manuel Noriega. The Minnesota residents returned to the 
United States a day after the invasion began. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled today on a 1986 federal law known as the Montgomery Amendment 
that limits the power of governors to withhold consent to federal deployment of 
National Guard units. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment was enacted after several governors said they opposed the Reagan 
Administration's Central American policy and did not want National Guard troops 
from their states assigned to training missions in that region. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment prohibits any governor from withholding consent to a National 
Guard unit's active duty outside the country because of an objection to the 
site, purpose or schedule of the duty. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.), the amendment's author, said 50 
governors should not be allowed to veto National Guard missions because they do 
not like foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that the Montgomery Amendment is not inconsistent with the 
(Constitution's) militia clauses," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
"This case does not raise any question concerning the wisdom of the 
gubernatorial veto established in 1952, or of its partial repeal in 1986," he 
added. "We merely hold that since the former was not constitutionally 
compelled, the Montgomery Amendment is constitutionally valid."

The head of the U.N. food agency warned Africa today that it is on the path to 
total destruction of its natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
Edouard Saouma, director general of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, 
told an agency conference on Africa that the continent faces "an extremely 
serious threat of accelerated, continent-wide environmental decline with the 
inevitable outcome in the long term of total depletion." 
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech to delegates from 51 states, he said there is a widening 
gap between agricultural production, which grew at 2% over the last decade, and 
population, which grew at 3%. 
</P>
<P>
At the three-day conference the FAO will outline a series of remedial steps for 
which it has budgeted $527 million in 1990-91. Land reclamation, soil 
conservation and increasing food production by training farmers in more 
efficient methods will be the focus of the FAO plan.

Two 19-year-old whites convicted in the mob beating death of a black teen-ager 
received maximum sentences today. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Fama was sentenced to 32 2/3 years to life in prison for his conviction 
on murder and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Mondello, the reputed ringleader of the bat-wielding mob who was 
convicted of lesser offenses, was sentenced to the maximum 5 1/3 to 16 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Mr. Mondello, there would not have been the death of anyone. It was a 
senseless death," said state Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens. 
</P>
<P>
As Owens delivered Fama's sentence in the packed courtroom, Moses Stewart, the 
father of slain teen-ager Yusuf Hawkins, watched intently and whispered loudly, 
"Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
Mondello had been sentenced earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Mondello was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges but convicted of 
riot, unlawful imprisonment and discrimination in the Aug. 23 incident that 
spurred racial tensions in the city. Fama was convicted of murder and other 
charges.

One out of every six jobs created through the year 2000 will be located in 
California, according to a forecast published today by the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
California also will retain its rank as the most populous state, the projection 
by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said, and will continue to have 
the highest total personal income. 
</P>
<P>
California is projected to gain 3.4 million of the 18.9 million new jobs 
created nationally between 1988 and 2000. Its population will total 33.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
California and three other states -- Florida, New York and Texas -- are 
projected to account for one-third of the nation's $4.1 trillion total personal 
income. 
</P>
<P>
Personal income in California will be the highest in the nation at $568 
billion. Incomes will total $330 billion in New York, $250 billion in Texas and 
$226 billion in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
But Arizona and Nevada will post the fastest growth rates in total personal 
income, jobs and population, while Connecticut will continue to have the 
highest per capita income at $20,503. 
</P>
<P>
Total personal income is projected to grow 46.2% in Nevada, well above the 
projected national income increase of 26.2%. Arizona income will increase by 
40.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The number of jobs will increase 31.5% in Nevada and 26.7% in Arizona, compared 
to 14.3% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Population in Nevada will jump 29.8%, followed by Arizona and Florida, 21.4% 
and 18.2% respectively. The national population is expected to grow 8.9%. 
</P>
<P>
"The projected growth in Nevada and Arizona reflects rapid population growth 
and strength in their economies, in part due to the continued shift in economic 
activity toward the Sun Belt," the study said. "Florida, Utah, California and 
Hawaii also are projected to show rapid growth." 
</P>
<P>
Populations will increase in every state except Wyoming, Louisiana and West 
Virginia, which will post declines of 1%, 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
New England and BEA's Mideast region -- Delaware, Washington, D.C., Maryland, 
New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania -- will have the lowest total personal 
income growth, 21.6% and 21.3%, respectively, followed by the Great Lakes, with 
22%. 
</P>
<P>
According to the BEA, two-thirds of the states are projected to have per capita 
incomes below the national average, and 11 states -- predominantly in the South 
-- are projected to have per capita incomes that are 20% or more below the 
national average.

employees. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which opened with 13 children, will ultimately accommodate 72 
children, from 3 months to 5 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
It is located on the first floor of Lotus' new developers' building, across 
from corporate headquarters in Cambridge. 
</P>
<P>
Features of the center include a sliding fee scale, so any employee whose child 
is selected to be in the center (selection is by lottery) will be able to use 
the facility; a commitment to a diverse student body and staff; a "get-well 
room" for children enrolled in the center who are recovering from mild 
illnesses, and the use of cloth diapers, for ecological reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"With this facility, Lotus is providing some of the best child care available 
to working parents anywhere in this country," said Mike Balloch, vice 
president, Corporate Services.

AFTER-TAX PROFIT DROPS 4.9% IN FIRST QUARTER

Manufacturers' after-tax profits totaled $28.6 billion in the first quarter of 
the year, down $1.5 billion, or 4.9%, from the final quarter of 1989, the 
Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
After-tax profits averaged 4.2 cents on the dollar of sales in the first three 
months of the year, a decline of 0.2 cents from the previous three months, the 
department's Census Bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in January, February and March totaled $683.5 billion, a gain of $2.9 
billion or 0.4% from October, November and December, the department said in its 
quarterly report. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were adjusted to reflect seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
Food and printing businesses contributed to a significant decline in 
first-quarter profits for the makers of non-durable goods, the Commerce 
Department said. Textiles declined too. 
</P>
<P>
"Petroleum was also down," the government report said. "Fourth-quarter profits 
benefited from downward adjustments to federal tax provisions not applicable to 
this quarter." 
</P>
<P>
But quarterly after-tax profits were on the rise for the makers of rubber 
products, paper and chemicals, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
In the category of durable goods -- expensive items made to last three or more 
years, from aircraft to washing machines -- there were large increases in the 
profits of manufacturers of transportation equipment, primary metals and 
fabricated metals. 
</P>
<P>
But quarterly after-tax profits for stone, clay and glass businesses declined 
sharply, as did profits for makers of electrical machinery and non-electrical 
machinery, the Commerce Department said.

LIZ TAYLOR 'ROMANCE' WITH 23-YEAR-OLD A HOAX

Elizabeth Taylor's spokeswoman said today that news stories about a romance 
between the actress and a 23-year-old Detroit man were a hoax engineered by a 
woman who intercepted messages from the publicist's answering service. 
</P>
<P>
Chen Sam, Taylor's publicist in New York, said the Oscar-winning actress is not 
"romantically linked" to Julian Lee Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is a hoax and a sick one to boot," Sam said. "It's sick people 
doing this." 
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Taylor has never heard of him," Sam said. "Nobody seems to know who this 
Julian Lee Hobbs is; he seems to have appeared out of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Sam said a woman identifying herself as Lisa Flowers had gained access to the 
publicist's telephone answering service, using a secret code, and returned 
telephone calls, giving out the false information to reporters, including those 
from United Press International and the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told reporters that Hobbs flew in from Detroit and spent the weekend 
at Taylor's side, helping with the depression that had hindered her recovery. 
She said the couple planned to go to Taylor's Switzerland home when she was 
released from the hospital. 
</P>

"There's a lady by the name of Lisa Flowers who is going around to all the 
media and stating that she works for my office," Sam said. "I don't have such a 
person in my office. She's going to such lengths to give out this information 
that she is even using my answering service exchange number." 
</P>
<P>
Sam said the woman apparently called the service to pick up messages, saying 
she worked for the publicist's company, Chen Sam Associates Inc., and used a 
numerical code to identify herself as an employee. 
</P>
<P>
"She's saying she's Lisa Flowers and works for Chen Sam Associates and giving 
them my answering service exchange number so she can get my answering service 
to take messages from the media," Sam said. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought she worked for me; I do have a Lisa Del Favero," Sam said. "What 
we're trying to find out is how she found out the (code) number." 
</P>
<P>
Sam said an investigation is under way through Taylor's attorneys to track down 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Sam said the report that Taylor, 58, underwent an abdominal biopsy also was 
false. 
</P>
<P>
"They also stated yesterday that she had another biopsy, which is also untrue," 
Sam said. "She's doing extremely well and going home in two weeks' time." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the actress's reaction to the story, Sam she was nonplussed. 
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Taylor doesn't even listen to all this," said Sam, who said her office was 
deluged with telephone calls from news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was admitted to St. John's Hospital and Health Center April 16 after 
being transferred from another hospital where she had been undergoing treatment 
since April 9 for a sinus infection and high fever. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's health problems date to her childhood, when she was injured in a fall 
from a horse while filming the 1945 movie "National Velvet." She nearly died of 
pneumonia in the early 1960s and has admitted to a long dependence on alcohol 
and such drugs as Demerol and Valium. 
</P>
<P>
She won best-actress Oscars for "Butterfield 8" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf?" and has been married seven times, twice to the late actor Richard 
Burton. She was linked to publishing magnate Malcolm Forbes, who died recently, 
and Sam said she has been seeing Larry Fortensky, 35, who works in the 
construction industry in Los Angeles, for a year and a half.

For 17 years Anjelica Huston lived in the limelight of her lover, Jack 
Nicholson. But now, with Nicholson out of the picture, she is stepping into her 
own spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Their erratic relationship came to an end last year when Nicholson had an 
affair with a former waitress, Rebecca Broussard, who had Nicholson's baby in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Huston, who won an Oscar for her role in "Prizzi's Honor," said her recent 
screen work has mirrored and helped manage her life. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared in "Crimes and Misdemeanors" as a woman rejected by her married 
lover. When she finished "Enemies, A Love Story," in which she plays a woman 
whose husband has a child by another woman, she went home to the harsh reality 
of Nicholson's infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
"That very much reflected what was to go on in my life directly after I came 
back to Los Angeles after the movie. That was pretty close to the bone," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Huston said she doesn't know if she is ready to be part of a couple again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm selfish and opinionated," she said. "I think I follow less than I used to. 
It's hard for me to sit and nod my head at repeated stories anymore."

GOV. TAKES CREDIT FOR RAPPERS' ARRESTS

Gov. Bob Martinez claimed credit today for sparking a crackdown against the rap 
group 2 Live Crew, as authorities prepared to charge a third band member with 
violating the state obscenity law. 
</P>
<P>
Broward County sheriff's deputies arrested two band members early Sunday, 
shortly after the band finished a live performance in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, a Republican facing a potentially tough reelection race this year, 
asked statewide prosecutor Peter Antonacci in February to mount a racketeering 
and obscenity investigation of the group's album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be," 
saying sale of the sexually explicit recording to minors "violates all 
conceivable standards of decency." 
</P>
<P>
Antonacci declined, saying local prosecution made more sense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the local jurisdictions took him (Antonacci) at his word," Martinez 
said in Tallahassee. "I think this (album) is a form of, in this case, audio 
pornography." 
</P>
<P>
The album has been declared obscene in south Florida and in at least eight 
other counties across the state. 
</P>
<P>
Broward Sgt. Bob Faulkner said authorities plan to issue a notice to appear 
charging band member Mark Ross with the first-degree misdemeanor, punishable by 
up to a year in jail and a fine of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner said a fourth band member, David Hobbs, will not be charged because he 
did not recite the controversial lyrics during the performance. 
</P>
<P>
2 Live Crew is not expected to return to south Florida from Phoenix until 
Tuesday, said Bruce Rogow, the band's attorney. The band flew to Phoenix on 
Sunday for a performance there. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had planned to arrest all four band members after the weekend 
concert but failed to nab Ross and Hobbs after they left the club in a separate 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities decided Monday not to issue warrants for their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Rogow said band members will cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Band leader Luther Campbell, 29, and member Chris Won Wong, 26, were arrested 
Sunday without incident several blocks from Club Futura. 
</P>
<P>
Broward deputies acted under the authority of a civil ruling issued Wednesday 
in Ft. Lauderdale by U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez, who said "As Nasty as 
They Wanna Be" is legally obscene by south Florida standards because its lyrics 
vividly depict sexual acts and lack any redeeming social value. His ruling 
applied in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. 
</P>
<P>
In Tallahassee, Martinez was asked about reports that the controversy had 
boosted sales of the album. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a small percentage that that (album) will appeal to," Martinez 
said. "It doesn't to me, and I think it doesn't to the majority of the people 
in this state or the majority of people in this nation."

Oscar-winning actress Shirley MacLaine says her recent knee operation probably 
added 15 years to her dancing career. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a video taken of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor said it was the best movie I ever made," said MacLaine, who is in 
town preparing for Tuesday's opening of a national performance tour. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery to repair torn ligaments and a dislocated kneecap came after she 
was hurt while rehearsing a dance number earlier this spring. 
</P>
<P>
MacLaine, 56, says she lifted weights and exercised the knee underwater to 
rebuild her strength. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my first operation ever, and I could have seen it as a tragedy," she 
said. "But it slowed me down to reflect, so I've almost finished another book. 
I think it has given me another 15 years of dancing." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran actress won best actress honors for the 1982 film "Terms of 
Endearment." 
</P>
<P>
The actress-singer-dancer and best-selling author has written several 
metaphysical books, including "Out on a Limb" and "Dancing in Light." 
</P>
<P>
Her next movie project is to play silent movie star Louise Brooks in a 
biographical film.

Carroll Shelby, designer of the muscle car that bears his name, is doing well 
after a heart transplant, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing fine, according to the hospital's transplant coordinator," the 
spokesman, Glenn Campbell, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He said Shelby hasn't been able to get out of bed yet, but "the recovery is 
going along normally." 
</P>
<P>
Shelby, 67, received the heart during a four-hour operation at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center on Thursday night. No information on the donor was released. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby is a three-time U.S. Sports Car driver of the year and designer of the 
Shelby Cobra. He also worked as a consultant for Chrysler Motors on the design 
of its new Viper sports car. 
</P>
<P>
The popular Texan, whose chili recipes have become as famous as his race car 
designs and auto customizing, suffered from congestive heart failure. Shelby 
had heart surgery in 1973 and 1978.

JOSE CANSECO TO REMAIN IN TRACTION 'FEW MORE DAYS';

BASEBALL: ATHLETICS RIGHT FIELDER GETS TREATMENT INCLUDING REST, THERAPY AND 
MEDICATION FOR BACK PAIN.

Jose Canseco will remain in traction for "at least a few more days," according 
to a hospital spokeswoman who said today the Oakland Athletics' right fielder 
was undergoing a treatment plan of rest, therapy and medication for back pain. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, who has a history of back problems, spent the weekend undergoing 
physical therapy and taking oral anti-inflammatory drugs, said Children's 
Hospital spokeswoman Ann Heglin, adding that Canseco also spent time in 
traction to help reduce the inflammation of a bulging lower disc. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco was admitted to Children's Hospital on Saturday. A CAT scan revealed a 
bulging lower disc pressing against the sciatic nerve, causing pain in 
Canseco's lower back and right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Heglin said Canseco will remain in traction for "at least a few more days." 
</P>
<P>
Despite earlier reports of possible surgery for Canseco, team orthopedist Rick 
Bost said surgery "is not even being discussed." 
</P>
<P>
"He shows some encouraging signs of improvement," Bost said. "It's hard to make 
a prediction -- it's a day-to-day situation." 
</P>
<P>
Bost said Canseco's injury is "in response to his activity -- swinging a bat." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors remained uncertain when Canseco will play again and speculation varied 
from a few days to a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"With disc problems you are never entirely certain," said A's physician Dr. 
Allan Pont. "You don't know if it's a one-hour problem or a one-year problem." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, who was able to continue playing baseball several years ago when he 
suffered from back pain for about three months, started feeling increased pain 
during last weekend's series at Oakland against Kansas City. He has not played 
since last Thursday in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The injury disrupts what could be Canseco's best season. He started the A's 
first 52 games and posted a .320 average with 20 home runs and 50 RBI's. He is 
second to Detroit's Cecil Fielder in both categories.

The men's indoor tennis tournament held here each autumn for the last 14 years 
was dropped today when its chief sponsor pulled out, citing "changes in the 
men's professional tour." 
</P>
<P>
Promoters said they had considered all alternatives and "regrettably, there is 
no other acceptable course available to us." 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, first known as the Benson and Hedges Championships, was to have 
been staged Nov. 5-11. But tournament director Len Owen said the sponsors were 
concerned that, with that week designated as a "free week" by the Assn. of 
Tennis Professionals, "we faced the threat of exhibition matches featuring top 
players being staged against us."

'FEED INTO' SOCCER; THE REWARD IS BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Now is the time for armchair spectators to give soccer another chance. I know 
soccer has never commanded much interest here because Americans regard it as 
too much of a slow-moving, punchless game, but it is popular the world over, 
and now we have the World Cup, the most-watched of tournaments, lighting up our 
magic lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
The TNT cable network is covering 24 of the 52 matches through the final on 
July 8. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Neal, the veteran Turner cable sportscaster, heads the 'A' announcing team, 
calling about 14 games with Mick Luckhurst, the former Atlanta Falcons 
field-goal kicker from England. Neal is smart enough to admit it will be no 
easy task to get Americans involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans have so many sports, we have not learned how to feed into soccer," 
he said. "I did six years of North American League soccer and am not blowing 
smoke when I say I got next to it. I found real beauty in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"The beauty," he said, "is not in the scoring, but in the work that leads to 
the score. I know that doesn't excite Americans who are used to the faster pace 
of basketball and hockey, but when you are into soccer, you recognize that 
teams build the play from the back. The secret is to use the entire field to 
create open space for a shot at the goal. It might take nine or 10 of these 
builds for this to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you this. When you are involved in a game -- when a son of yours is 
playing or you are rooting for a team -- your heart beats faster every time the 
ball approaches the goal even if there is no score." 
</P>
<P>
Neal doesn't expect the World Cup to eradicate American apathy. "But I think 
there are elements here similar to the NCAA basketball tournament. With 
continuity, people can begin to find a team and follow it. You can watch a star 
like Diego Maradona of Argentina and begin to relate to him the way we relate 
to our star professionals." 
</P>
<P>
I have always thought soccer is a more sane and worthwhile game than football 
but have never been able to "feed into the sport" because I am unable to 
appreciate the nuances of non-scoring action. The World Cup, however, does 
present magnificent spectacle and nationalistic fervor that is involving. It 
has the nuttiness of scheduling England and Ireland in far-off Sardinia for 
fear of violence if too many home fans were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
I am dipping into the World Cup action on the tube because the United States 
has a team in it, and it serves as a prelude to 1994, when the World Cup 
becomes a bigger deal here because we will be hosting it for the first time.

Cameroon owes its World Cup success to physical prowess, but team doctor Pierre 
Tsala Mbala says witch doctors and sorcerers may give the players a 
psychological edge. 
</P>
<P>
Witchcraft plays a major role in African soccer, even though officials have 
tried in recent years to discourage ties between players and purveyors of 
"traditional medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Tsala Mbala said witch doctors are prohibited from physically treating members 
of the Cameroon team, which shocked defending champion Argentina 1-0 in 
Friday's opening match. 
</P>
<P>
But the professor of human physiology said there is nothing wrong with players 
seeking advice, predictions or good-luck charms from witch doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot explain victories by magic," said Tsala Mbala, a specialist in 
sports medicine. "But the magic is a little something extra for the players 
psychologically."

U.S. TEAM IN SHOCK OVER ROUT BY CZECHS

<P>
Humiliated in a 5-1 loss Sunday to Czechoslovakia in its World Cup opener, the 
U.S. soccer team could hardly have expected better reviews than it received the 
next day in the Italian press. 
</P>
<P>
But because the International Federation of International Football will not 
allow the United States to close the show until after its third and presumably 
final game June 19 against Austria, workouts continued as scheduled at a 
seaside training camp today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler looked on the bright side. 
</P>
<P>
"Sun's shining, let's not dwell on what happened," he said as he sent his team 
onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
Following his lead, the players tried to act as if nothing had happened. But it 
was like trying to ignore a train wreck. They were still in shock. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it this way," forward Bruce Murray said. "We can't play any worse." 
</P>
<P>
But, as the United States is likely to discover Thursday in Rome's Olympic 
Stadium, the opposition can play better. Next on the schedule is Italy, the 
tournament favorite. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian press predicts a goleada , which, loosely translated, means rout. 
</P>
<P>
"This could get ugly if we have the wrong attitude," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
As if Gansler did not have enough problems trying to revive his team's spirits, 
he must replace offensive midfielder Eric Wynalda of Westlake Village among the 
starting 11. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda was issued a red card for a flagrant foul in the 50th minute, which 
disqualified him not only for the remainder of the first game but also for the 
second game as well. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the federation's stricter "fair play" rules, a red card also carries 
a $7,000 fine, which Wynalda may have difficulty paying on his salary of about 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Irish players have announced they will pool their money to pay for fines levied 
against them, but it is unlikely that Wynalda's teammates will do the same for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
They were not feeling charitable toward him after his ejection left them with 
only 10 men for the final 40 minutes. Some players said they felt as if there 
were only 10 men on the field when he was playing. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda, who prefers playing forward, has not been happy since he was moved 
last month to the midfield in an effort to inject more offense into the team. 
His negative attitude appears to have affected his play. 
</P>
<P>
One player lectured Wynalda at halftime, calling him immature. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if Eric could play against Italy, there might have been a change," 
reserve forward Chris Sullivan said. "That's a very special position, one that 
has to be effective for us. Eric wasn't a factor there." 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda said he did not deserve the red card, which came after he shoved a 
player, Jozef Chovanec, in the midfield. Wynalda said the Czech had been 
baiting him the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a blatant foul," Wynalda said. "I'm not a hothead. I would just call 
it a bad mistake, if anything." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler was not so easy on Wynalda. The coach said he warned Wynalda at 
halftime that the referee would be watching him closely after his running 
battle with Chovanec in the first 45 minutes. Five minutes into the second 
half, Wynalda was sent off. 
</P>
<P>
"He obviously forgot it quickly," Gansler said. "That's inexperience, 
exuberance or the stupidity of youth." Saturday was Wynalda's 21st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler said he will consider two defenders, Jimmy Banks and Paul Krumpe, and 
Sullivan for Wynalda's position. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler said he may make other changes in the lineup but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
In the Italian newspapers, which evaluate the players after each game, only 
goalkeeper Tony Meola, midfielder Paul Caligiuri and midfielder Tab Ramos 
received high grades for their play against the Czechs. 
</P>
<P>
The headline on the game story in Corriere Dello Sport read, "The USA: What a 
Delusion." 
</P>
<P>
The correspondent for Gazetta Dello Sport, Lodovico Maradei, wrote that 
Czechoslovakia won with "incredible ease. At the end, the soccer was reduced to 
a church-league level with farcical aspects that made it impossible to evaluate 
the potential of the Czechs."

Rowdy fans from the World Cup soccer games fought each other in a train station 
today, after a series of clashes over the weekend by rock- and bottle-throwing 
fans left dozens injured. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting occurred as the fans were leaving on trains, and at least 50 
people were arrested, reported the Italian news agency ANSA. 
</P>
<P>
Their nationalities were not immediately known, but Sunday's violence broke out 
between West Germans and Yugoslavs. 
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports on injuries in today's fighting, but newspaper 
reports said some trains were delayed as much as two hours while police broke 
up the fighting and made arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities vowed today to tighten security surrounding World Cup soccer 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting today followed a clash Sunday before a West German-Yugoslav match 
that erupted when German fans, hurling rocks, firecrackers and bottles, 
attacked a group of Yugoslav fans waving their national flag. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of injuries could not be immediately determined, but Italian 
newspapers reported today that about 30 people were hurt, including fans and 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out outside the Duomo, Milan's spire-topped cathedral and 
city symbol.

ARTHUR MILLER'S 'ENEMY' HAS FOUND A FRIEND; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: HIS ADAPTATION OF THE IBSEN CLASSIC AIRS ON 'AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE' 
WEDNESDAY. IT HAS BEEN ONE OF HIS HAPPIER COLLABORATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Excuse me," the young actor said nervously. "Could you please autograph this?" 
</P>
<P>
The balding, bespectacled man looked up from his lunch and smiled. "Sure," he 
told the actor, a boy not more than 12 whom he had met earlier that day. "Put 
it here." 
</P>
<P>
The boy put a script on the man's lap and gave him a felt pen. The man quickly 
scribbled Arthur Miller on a page and handed it back to him. The young fan 
beamed. "Thank you," he said and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old playwright began to chuckle ever so slightly: "That kid told 
me, 'I read your book, 'The Crucible.' " 
</P>
<P>
Miller had flown in from his Connecticut home to observe a read-through of the 
"American Playhouse" production of "An Enemy of the People," starring John 
Glover and George Grizzard, which airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. on KCET Channel 28 
and KPBS Channel 15. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years ago, Miller adapted 19th-Century Norwegian playwright Henrik 
Ibsen's all-too-relevant tale of a doctor who discovers industrial pollution in 
his community and is condemned by its citizens when he demands the truth be 
told. For the "American Playhouse" production, the locale has been switched 
from Norway to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Miller sat silently at the head of a large table in a rehearsal hall at 
Fox/KTTV studios and listened intently to the actors reciting their lines. When 
the play was finished, Miller shut the script and sat back in his chair. He 
smiled at the cast. He told them he was happy with what he heard. 
</P>
<P>
Director Jack O'Brien interrupted the proceedings to call lunch, and the man 
who wrote such classics as "All My Sons," "Death of a Salesman" and "The 
Crucible" retreated to the porch outside the rehearsal hall. He made himself 
comfortable in a straight-back chair and took a bite of his roast beef 
sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very good," Miller said of the cast. "They had never done that last 
part before. The rest of the play they have been working on, but this is their 
first go at it." 
</P>
<P>
"An Enemy of the People" marks the second time that Miller and O'Brien have 
collaborated on an "American Playhouse" production. Three years ago, O'Brien 
directed "All My Sons" to great acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very good," Miller said over the din of cars roaring by on the Hollywood 
Freeway. "He's real interpretive and knows how to read. His 'All My Sons' was a 
beautiful production -- better than the film version." 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful is not the word Miller would use to describe the film versions of his 
work -- especially "All My Sons" (1948) and "Death of a Salesman" (1951). 
</P>
<P>
"In those days when there were big studios, they wanted the playwright as far 
away as possible," Miller said. "Clifford Odets wrote screenplays but he worked 
out here. I never did that. If you weren't going to do that, they didn't want 
the original writer around. Finally, they would send me a shooting script a 
couple of weeks before they were going to start and I would object." 
</P>
<P>
But the studios never listened to his objections. "I think a certain amount of 
adaptation is required, but (what) happens in general is that the gigantic 
effect of scenes gets undermined because they pull the scenes apart like a 
sweater." 
</P>
<P>
He gives high marks to the 1985 Dustin Hoffman TV version of "Salesman," which 
was directed by Volker Schlondorff. "That was the play purely and simply," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee J. Cobb, who originated the Willy Loman role on Broadway when he was only 
in his 30s, also did a TV version of "Salesman" in 1966 that Miller admired. 
"Lee was a great actor," he said with a twinkle in his eyes. "Lee was old when 
he was 2." 
</P>
<P>
Miller is working on a new play but won't divulge any details. "Broadway is not 
a very happy place," he said. "At Lincoln Center, though, people are trying to 
do some interesting work. They are doing a play of mine next October, 'The 
Archbishop's Ceiling.' That was done at the Royal Shakespeare Company. They do 
a lot of my plays in England. They have theater instilled in them. It's been 
cultivated by those great theater companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," he said, "I can't complain. My work is done more now in and out of 
this country than ever." 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect Miller to write another screenplay. His first, "The Misfits," 
starred his second wife, Marilyn Monroe, and Clark Gable. The moody drama 
failed at the box office in 1961, but has gained in reputation over the years. 
His second, "Everybody Wins," opened this year and was a critical and 
commercial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I never liked to write screenplays," Miller said. " 'Everybody Wins' seemed 
like a good idea at the time. You can't control them unless you are going to 
direct it. It could have been something, but there were too many variations, 
which I don't like. Why waste my time?"

NIGERIAN BAND EXUDES WARM, GENTLE FEELINGS;

<P>
MUSIC: KING SUNNY ADE AND HIS GROUP, WHO WILL PLAY IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
TONIGHT, BRUSH ASIDE STEREOTYPICAL CONCEPTS AND BLEND DRUMS, VOICES AND GUITARS 
INTO AN EXOTIC FORCE.

<P>
What a difference Ade makes: Before the groundbreaking 1984 U.S. tour of King 
Sunny Ade and His African Beats, the American concept of African music was 
pretty much informed by jungle-movie images of guys jabbering and banging on 
logs, or by bongo-happy budget-label records with titles like "Savage Stereo 
Rhythms." 
</P>
<P>
All that was brushed aside by Ade's tour, which showed his Nigerian juju music 
to be an entrancing and complex mesh of talking drums, voices, electric guitars 
and shimmering pedal steel guitar, all woven together in a rich concordance 
that might be about as close as music gets to representing the fabric of 
existence. The flowing interplay of his 20 or so musicians made the Grateful 
Dead seem like a lounge band. 
</P>
<P>
More impressive than the freshness of the music was the warmth and gentle force 
of it, and even though Ade sang in his native Yoruba, his charisma was such 
that he was hailed in many quarters as the next Bob Marley. After the opening 
he forged for the music, a remarkably varied number of other African bands have 
had the opportunity to show their stuff here, receiving a big pump from Paul 
Simon's South Africa-based "Graceland" album. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, Ade has toured the United States enthusiastically, though the 
superstar fame predicted for him has yet to happen. His career has been 
hampered lately by the lack of an American label -- he was dropped by Island 
Records, in part because he wouldn't change his band makeup to fit the label's 
idea of what he should be. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that Ade needs the U.S. success. He is booked through 1994 in Nigeria, 
where he issues three albums a year, and each typically sells about 200,000 
copies. Born a prince in the Ondo royal family, he's none too poorly situated 
to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
So what is it that impels him to tour the slow-waking States again? 
</P>
<P>
"I think I am a messenger, the music is," he said in his soft, accented 
English, politely fielding a phone interview from a closet in Austin's 
cattle-shed-like Liberty Lunch club on a melting Texas afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It is stretching out the hands of love, honesty and likeness to your friend. 
If you know you love your friends, why can't you dance with him? If you love 
your partner, dance. In this time, to live to this age we need to rejoice. If 
possible, we dance with God if we can see him. You only have to listen to it to 
jump up and dance -- that's the kind of music we play. And that's why we come 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The other key figure on the Nigerian music scene is Fela Kuti (who is coming to 
the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on July 29), and the two are a contrast in 
philosophies of what music should convey. Where Fela is a political firebrand 
whose songs exhorting political change have led to his being jailed innumerable 
times (one long stint made him the subject of an Amnesty International action), 
Ade chiefly offers songs in praise of kindness and enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"Fela is a politician and preaches political songs," Ade said. "I don't look at 
it that way. I preach the love, happiness and making people relax. If you go 
out to listen to political songs, it will linger on in your mind. But if you 
play my music after that, then you feel happy and then you can sleep and 
tomorrow are better able to think about the other things. I just believe that I 
want to play my kind of music for the people of the world to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
But even without a politicized message, he believes that his music is a force 
for change. 
</P>
<P>
"Music has its own language by the way it plays. Music is everything. I think 
music is the most powerful thing ever in the world. And it is the most 
extraordinarily easy way to catch people. You can listen to music better than 
you can to people talking to you. And you can get a message from the music 
easier than people teaching you what to do. The music is the mind of the people 
in this world today. 
</P>
<P>
"Any country or any part of the world where the government doesn't allow the 
music to play, you will find no people there. They will break the wall of their 
border to go to where there is music. You can imagine how powerful the music 
is: When the wall of Berlin was up, the musicians used to put their stage near 
to the wall, so that the other side of Germany would listen to their songs. And 
everybody would listen, and here today the wall of Germany has been broken and 
everybody now is mixing together." 
</P>
<P>
On the current tour, Ade has 17 other musicians with him. He has lost a few 
players to "indiscipline" over the years, but, compared to most Western groups, 
he has maintained a very consistent outfit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a job and like a family," he said, "It's our life, so we are all 
together all the time. I love my band. As I'm close to my members, eventually 
I'm close to their families as well. Every single one of us has our families 
and we have fans all over the world. We're always close to people. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about here, but way back home it's like you're interested in the 
one particular music you're playing. As a profession you take it as your daily 
job whereby you live with it. In our band we stretch out honesty to each other. 
I believe it is not only my band . . . 90% of African bands do the same thing, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The economics of touring such a large outfit give the band very little time to 
really see the countries they visit. But Ade said he takes a special joy from 
his international tours. 
</P>
<P>
"It is that I go throughout the whole world and play my music for them and they 
react to my music the same way they do back home," he said, "so it makes me 
feel that people everywhere in the world, we have the ability to enjoy 
ourselves, to be happy with ourselves, that we can know one another. It is all 
like home." 
</P>
<P>
There is one thing, though, that sets his Nigerian gigs apart from the ones he 
plays here. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not usually play so long here. It depends on what time the host or the 
hostesses want. We may play two, three or one hour, depending on the venue or 
festival. I did six or seven hours in Houston once, and almost 10 hours in New 
York one time. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally at home it is like you have in discos here, except with bands, where 
the music starts at 8 and goes until 5 in the morning. In Nigeria we play long: 
as-long-as-you-can-dance long." 
</P>
<P>
 King Sunny Ade and his African Beats play tonight at 8 p.m. at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $19.50. 
Information: (714) 496-8930.

SCOTT TUROW'S TIME HAS COME; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: AFTER ONLY THREE DAYS IN THE BOOKSTORES, THE LATEST EFFORT FROM THE 
AUTHOR OF "PRESUMED INNOCENT" TOPS THE BEST-SELLER LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
At a party celebrating the publication of his new novel, "The Burden of Proof," 
in New York City late last week, best-selling author Scott Turow said it best 
when he told his publisher: "Leaving aside the birth of my children, this has 
probably been the best week of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Chicago attorney-novelist, whose 1987 first novel, "Presumed 
Innocent," was a publishing phenomenon, joined the ranks of Ernest Hemingway, 
J.D. Salinger and Alex Haley by becoming the 92nd writer to appear on the cover 
of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Turow's first glimpse of the Time cover came during an interview on the "Today" 
show when host Bryant Gumbel handed him a copy still hot off the press. 
</P>
<P>
"That truly blew me away," said Turow. "I suffer my defeats and I have a hard 
time enjoying my triumphs, but I'll tell you that one I really enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Turow learned that "The Burden of Proof," after three days in 
bookstores, will be ranked No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list next 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
And on Thursday, "Entertainment Tonight" taped the author "gazing in wonder" at 
a huge electronic billboard in Times Square advertising "The Burden of Proof," 
complete with a computerized picture of the author. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very heady stuff, there's no way around it," said Turow, 41, recalling 
the time when his fondest dream was simply to hold in his hands a published 
novel he had written. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to adjust, frankly, to any of this stuff," said Turow, a 
former assistant United States attorney who is now a partner in a large Chicago 
law firm. "A big part of me just wants to go home, sort of grab my kids and go 
back to work and do what I know best." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to his euphoria last week was the fact that Turow had just returned from 
his 20-year reunion at Amherst College, where he began writing "seriously" 
before moving on to Stanford and Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who have known me forever and can enjoy my success with me 
and who have, in each instance, considerable success of their own," he said. 
"So it was a pretty spectacular week, on top of which my wife was with me part 
of the time and got to enjoy it with me." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by phone from his New York City hotel room Friday morning, Turow was 
winding up the first week of a three-week publicity tour that will take him to 
San Francisco today and Los Angeles Wednesday. On Thursday, he'll speak at The 
Times Orange County Edition's annual Book and Author Luncheon in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The most memorable week in Turow's life did not start out that way. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times Book Review panned "The Burden of Proof," summing up with, 
"Scott Turow can do better, as he's already shown. And undoubtedly will again." 
</P>
<P>
And what was Turow's reaction to the review? "It's just terrible, horrible. 
It's like being trapped in a landslide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Turow was not too discouraged by that "one rotten review." His spirits were 
lifted by "extremely generous" reviews in the Boston Globe and the Washington 
Post, which began with, "Scott Turow's second novel proves beyond any 
reasonable doubt that his hugely successful first was no fluke." 
</P>
<P>
Observes Turow, the man whom Time magazine dubbed the Bard of the Litigious 
Age: "The fact of the matter is you can't connect with every reader and, in 
some ways, when you have a success the size of 'Presumed Innocent,' you're 
going to start behind the eight ball with some reviewers." 
</P>
<P>
The protagonist of "The Burden of Proof" will be familiar to readers of Turow's 
blockbuster first novel, which was on the New York Times best-seller list 44 
weeks and sold 712,000 hardcover copies and 4.3 million paperback copies in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
He's Alejandro "Sandy" Stern, the brilliant Midwestern attorney who 
masterminded the defense of Rusty Sabich, the prosecutor wrongfully accused of 
murdering a colleague in "Presumed Innocent." 
</P>
<P>
Turow fans will be able to refresh their memories of that story when the movie 
version of "Presumed Innocent," directed by Alan J. Pakula and starring 
Harrison Ford as Sabich, premieres in late July. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Burden of Proof," we pick up with Stern three years later. Returning 
home from a business trip, the middle-aged attorney discovers that Clara, his 
wife of 31 years, has committed suicide. She left only a four-word note: "Can 
you forgive me?" 
</P>
<P>
Why Clara killed herself is just one of the mysteries the beleaguered Stern 
must unravel. Another is why the Justice Department is investigating his 
brother-in-law, Dixon Hartnell, the wealthy, womanizing owner of a commodities 
futures brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Turow said the Sandy Stern of "The Burden of Proof" is based partly on his 
uncle, a doctor who lived in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always fascinated by his life and in his later years he found himself 
alone, unmarried and, I think, not entirely pleased with the way his life had 
gone," said Turow. "I always wanted to write a book about a man like that who 
was starting again." 
</P>
<P>
While writing "Presumed Innocent," Turow said he also had become fascinated 
with Stern. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't seem to be an oddball sort of novelistic creation," he said. "He 
seems to have integrity as a character . . . and I was very curious: Here's 
this Argentine Jew -- courtly, old world, formal and careful about the way he 
presents himself. What goes on inside this guy?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, while taking out the trash, Turow recalled, "I got this lightning 
bolt: I can put these things (Stern and his thoughts about his uncle) 
together." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't give a better example about how my creative process works than that 
story," Turow said, adding that it is a matter of combining "opportunities and 
long-term interests." 
</P>
<P>
Turow began the writing of "The Burden of Proof" while he was on his 
promotional tour for "Presumed Innocent" in 1987. He remembers working on the 
second chapter on a rented lap-top computer in an Anaheim hotel room one 
weekend while his newborn daughter was napping and his wife, Annette, and two 
older children were at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Turow's regular writing schedule is less haphazard. 
</P>
<P>
He writes mornings at home in his study, which is equipped with three phone 
lines, a computer and a fax machine. He works until the phone starts ringing 
about 10 o'clock and at noon he takes the train into Chicago for meetings with 
his colleagues and clients in his office in the Sears Tower. 
</P>
<P>
That all changes if he has to be in court or has morning meetings, said Turow, 
praising his law-firm partners who, "from the beginning, have been willing to 
accept the terms of my life and to say, 'Let's work this out together.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although it's sometimes difficult juggling two careers, Turow has no intention 
of giving up his law practice. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the material practicing law for 12 years has given to him as a novelist, 
he said, "I need it because of the daily stimulation. It somehow enhances my 
ability to reflect." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, "it keeps me sane," he said, recalling that when he read an advance 
copy of the negative review in the New York Times Book Review, he was glad he 
was able to turn his attention to his clients. 
</P>
<P>
While on his book tour, Turow has kept abreast of the three Grand Jury matters 
and a civil case he's currently involved in. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, between interviews with "Entertainment Tonight" and CBS radio he 
took time out to work on a brief. It has to do with the rights of outsiders to 
intervene in Grand Jury proceedings and is, Turow said, "a terrific issue." 
</P>
<P>
In coming weeks Turow's visage will become more recognizable across America. 
His publisher, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, has an initial $750,000 marketing 
budget to promote its 800,000-copy hardcover first printing of "The Burden of 
Proof" -- both record-breakers for the prestigious but medium-sized publishing 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Although the paperback rights to the novel reportedly sold for more than $3.2 
million, Turow will not disclose his unquestionably substantial income from the 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
"I really understand people's curiosity about it," he said. "I always want to 
know what football and baseball players make, but it just distracts from the 
book. Most people don't talk about how much money they make, and I'm like 
everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Although Turow was looking forward to spending the weekend at home with his 
family before heading west, he said he doesn't mind putting up with the demands 
of a publicity tour. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude toward this is if you like to cash the checks, then you've got to 
do the work that goes along with it," he said, adding that he criticizes "those 
quote unquote serious writers who take the money and don't want to commune with 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
As he sees it, "I am a writer who has self-consciously addressed himself to a 
broad audience. I want to be read and I want to reach out to that audience." 
</P>
<P>
Turow said he's more relaxed about the hoopla surrounding the publication of 
his second novel than he was the first. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I was really afraid it was going to destroy me," he said. He 
came to realize, however, that "my life isn't going to change. 
</P>
<P>
"The mistake is to believe that attention is going to somehow transform your 
internal life. It doesn't happen. If I hold onto the things that have always 
mattered to me and the people that have always mattered to me, everything will 
be fine." 
</P>
<P>
As for the week that was, he acknowledged, "It'll be awhile before I get as 
much of a charge out of anything."

OPERATION EXODUS LENDS SUPPORT TO SOVIET JEWS IN THEIR RETURN TO ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli businessman Mendel Kaplan reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a 
sheaf of papers written in Hebrew and English. In mundane words and numbers, 
the documents detail housing construction for Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel 
in a modern exodus that sometimes sets the world on edge. 
</P>
<P>
Casting aside geopolitics for a moment, Kaplan -- also head of the private 
agency responsible for transporting and resettling the emigrants -- flips 
through the pages and delivers a litany on the perils of putting up apartments 
in his country. 
</P>
<P>
Stabbing a finger at one project, he says: "I'm going to take photographs of 
(the contractor's) progress." Then he adds, "I've been in business in Israel 
for 20 years, and I'm happier when I'm checking up on the exact progress of 
every aspect of my activities. I'm putting it gently." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan, a steel and wire manufacturer who doubles as chairman of the Jewish 
Agency Board of Governors, is in Los Angeles on a private trip. But he concedes 
it is almost impossible to extract himself completely from the complex 
operation behind "another great moment in Jewish history, the ingathering of 
the last reservoir of Jews left in the world." 
</P>
<P>
In his Jewish Agency role, the bluff, no-nonsense Kaplan is at the focal point 
of a worldwide campaign to raise $600 million over the next three years to pay 
for the unprecedented and controversial flood of Jews leaving the Soviet Union 
for Israel. Jewish communities in the United States are expected to raise more 
than two-thirds of this amount, some $420 million. In Los Angeles, the goal is 
$36 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Soviet Union liberalized emigration policies in the spring of 1989, 
some 51,700 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel. Estimates of how many of the 
Soviet Union's 1.5 to 2 million Jews ultimately will leave have varied widely, 
ranging up to 1 million. Kaplan scoffs at these higher estimates and asserts 
that playing with potential immigration numbers is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"The more numbers (of Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel) you put in the 
newspaper, the more pressure the Arabs put on the Russians," he maintains, 
touching on one aspect of the political volatility of this issue, which mixes 
Soviet internal affairs and Big Power relations with the already fiery stew of 
Middle Eastern conflict. 
</P>
<P>
For example, during his recent summit meeting with President Bush, Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said his government would reconsider its 
emigration policy unless Israel guaranteed Soviet Jews would not be resettled 
on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Days later, the Soviets backed away 
from this position, telling U.S. officials they are "committed" to liberalized 
emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the number of Soviet Jewish families who have requested resettlement 
in Israel, Kaplan estimates that 600,000 to 700,000 currently are eligible to 
come to Israel. In Los Angeles, officials orchestrating the local fund-raising 
drive acknowledge the influx of Soviet Jews involves explosive issues, such as 
where they settle in Israel and the long-running uprising of Palestinians in 
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East 
War. 
</P>
<P>
But they say such issues are secondary to their main concern: helping as many 
Jews as possible to leave the Soviet Union as soon as possible. Citing worries 
about the Soviet Union's internal stability and a rise in anti-Semitism, they 
say fund-raising efforts for Operation Exodus have so far encountered little 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that there is "definitely some concern" about settlement of 
Soviet Jews on the West Bank, the Los Angeles Jewish community -- ranging from 
the "very orthodox" to the politically liberal -- has given broad support to 
the drive, said Richard Gunther, co-chairman of the local effort. Since its 
start-up last month, the campaign has raised $12 million in cash and pledges, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
How many emigrants have settled in the occupied territories is a matter of 
dispute that hinges partly on what the Israelis and their Arab opponents 
consider occupied territory. Before the new conservative coalition was formed 
on Friday, the caretaker government said that that 318 Soviet emigrants had 
moved to the West Bank. However, based on its own survey, the Associated Press 
reported that nearly 4,000 Jews also had moved to five suburbs of Arab east 
Jerusalem. Israel maintains that although it took that part of the city from 
Jordan during the 1967 war, it annexed the area and does not consider it 
occupied territory. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kaplan asserts that "every single housing unit that has been approved 
by the cabinet or ministry of housing for Jerusalem is inside the area 
controlled by Israel before 1967." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the contentious potential, the Los Angeles fund drive began quickly. 
The need for cash was so pressing, officials say, that the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles borrowed $4.6 million to assist immigrants 
already in Israel. The federation is the umbrella group directing the fund 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
"(Operation Exodus is) above and beyond our campaign for regular purposes, 
which will raise $52 million this year, and we had to open this drive 
immediately," says Wayne L. Feinstein, federation executive vice president. He 
notes that 70% of American Jews are of Russian and East European origin, and 
that they feel an affinity for their contemporaries in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"If my grandfather hadn't bought a steamship ticket out of Hamburg in the 
teens, I could very well be waiting for exit permission," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Basch, director of the Operation Exodus campaign, said the drive will 
attempt to tap donors who do not typically contribute to other Jewish 
campaigns, reaching a total of perhaps 70,000 to 80,000 contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan admits there has been a hurry-up nature to the resettlement program 
because the influx from the Soviet Union has been much greater than expected. 
In February, the Jewish Agency estimated that 70,000 Jews would come to Israel 
this year, and that number had been bumped up from 33,000 last fall. Now the 
agency is planning for 150,000 Jews to arrive in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The agency pays all transportation costs -- about $1,000 per person -- plus all 
the new immigrants' expenses for their first six months in Israel, Kaplan says. 
Currently, there are 20,000 empty housing units in Israel where Soviet 
immigrants might settle. A building program for 55,000 units will begin to 
provide additional housing in about a year, he says. 
</P>
<P>
He disputes reports that there has been "no progress" in providing housing, 
saying, "there is real progress on the ground. . . ." Contractors receive 
bonuses if they finish work on time or ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan is a native of South Africa and maintains ties with that country's 
Jewish community. Although he supports an end to apartheid, Kaplan says he 
draws no direct parallels with Soviet Jewish emigration and the freedom drives 
of black South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
Black South Africans are already in their homeland, he says, whereas Soviet 
Jewish emigration to Israel is another act in the age-old Jewish search for a 
homeland.
