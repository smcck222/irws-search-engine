THROWING PAPERS AT DAN QUAYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
News item: Man throws some papers at Vice President Dan Quayle, is arrested and 
charged with assault (a felony), and now could go away for 10 years and pay a 
$10,000 fine (Part A, June 7). 
</P>
<P>
Comment: This is another outrageous example of the loss of our civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
Any citizen should be able to redress elected officials by throwing "documents" 
at them. No one is asserting that the vice president was hurt in any way. The 
charges against Mwenea Sikuzote are a sham. Had he thrown his "documents" at 
the Washington Post's Ben Bradlee, for example, because he disagreed with an 
editorial, there would have been no arrest. Had he thrown his "documents" at 
the head coach of the Washington Redskins, because he didn't care for the 
coach's play selection, there would have been no arrest. Why should elected 
officials be so sacred as to be immune from hearing from an angry constituent 
in a non-harmful manner? 
</P>
<P>
By the way, I am a Republican and a supporter of the Bush-Quayle 
Administration. Elected officials are, after all, merely people, not gods. I 
wouldn't hesitate to do the same if I deemed it needed.

SAVING THE KIDS NO ONE WANTS; 
</P>
<P>
* LET SACRAMENTO DO THE JOB L.A. COUNTY CAN'T DO -- OR WON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials say they have lost confidence in the ability of Los Angeles 
County to run its own foster-care system. The accounts of abused foster 
children -- and the nonchalant response from county officials who are supposed 
to protect them -- indeed do not inspire confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is paid $3.3 million a year by the state to license and 
monitor 3,800 foster homes that house more than 10,000 children. These are the 
children, as Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) said, who "started 
out in life with the breaks against them" -- usually the abandoned, the beaten, 
the sexually molested. They go to foster homes run by people who are paid with 
public funds to care for them. Most foster parents do an admirable job. Some do 
not. The problem is that the county has done a poor job of ridding the system 
of those who only add trauma to broken young lives. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples: The state said county officials discovered 10 children sleeping 
on the floor of a foster-home garage and 10 more youngsters living in one 
bedroom; three of the children had been abused. Yet the county waited five 
months before reporting the case to state officials for license revocation. The 
home eventually was closed. In another case, a home licensed for four children 
had 20 infants sleeping in 10 cribs. 
</P>
<P>
The state is moving to take over the administration of the county's foster-care 
system in order to straighten out the mess, and the Board of Supervisors will 
consider having the county voluntarily relinquish its licensing authority. It 
should. 
</P>
<P>
The county in the past has contended that the state's aggressive stance is a 
way to protect itself legally. A lawsuit will eventually settle that score. But 
so far, the state's consistently assertive response to correcting alarming 
deficiencies in Los Angeles County's foster-care system is a welcome contrast 
to the county's own disconcerting placidity.

Does familiarity with democracy breed contempt? 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria -- oh so fresh and new to the democratic game -- 
people hit the polling booths over the weekend as if they were going to the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, 84% of the 6.4 million eligible voted; the Czech figure reached 
96% of 11.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Not here. Only 39% of the 19 million eligible bothered to vote last week in the 
California primary. Why? One theory: Nowadays people vote less because they 
think it does little good. In a way, non-voting is a kind of protest 
non-movement. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's another theory -- that fewer people vote these days because 
America is working well enough and people are not all that agitated. Hmm... By 
such logic, Californians must be profoundly satisfied with the way things are 
going -- Tuesday's turnout was the lowest since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's a theory that it's a good thing not everyone votes. With 
Tuesday's ballot loaded down with propositions, only the well-informed could 
not have been intimidated by the prospect of voting. So people who're aware of 
what's going on voted, while those who didn't much care or don't know much 
didn't. So why encourage ignorant voting by decrying low turnouts? 
</P>
<P>
Sophistries aside, it's better when more people care, when more people are 
informed, when more people vote. There were some good primary outcomes last 
week but overall the low turnout is telling us something. And it's not good.

PROTECTING EVEN THE MOST HORRID;

<P>
* THE CASE OF FLAG BURNING AND RAP MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In October of 1788, James Madison, then deeply enmeshed in the struggle to 
establish a new American Constitution, wrote this to his friend Thomas 
Jefferson: 
</P>
<P>
In October of 1788, James Madison, then deeply enmeshed in the struggle to 
establish a new American Constitution, wrote this to his friend Thomas 
Jefferson: 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever the real power in a Government lies, there is the danger of 
oppression. In our Governments the real power lies in the majority of the 
Community, and the invasion of private rights is chiefly to be apprehended, not 
from acts of Government contrary to the sense of its constituents, but from 
acts in which the Government is the mere instrument of the major number of the 
constituents . . . It is a melancholy reflection that liberty should be equally 
exposed to danger whether the Government have too much or too little power; and 
that the line which divides these extremes should be so inaccurately defined by 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
For 200 years, Americans have sought that line, and it was on the wisdom gained 
in the search that the U.S. Supreme Court relied on Monday, when it again 
struck down a law prohibiting vandalism of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the court majority, Justice William Brennan argued that "while flag 
desecration . . . is deeply offensive to many, the government may not prohibit 
the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself 
offensive or disagreeable . . . . Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the 
very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering." 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans do not agree and, as Madison anticipated, their elected 
representatives are eager to act on their behalf. Yet flag burning, though a 
very noxious form of expressive speech, does not threaten the country's basic 
well-being. Any attempt to end it by adding unneeded amendments to the 
Constitution or rewriting the Bill of Rights would. 
</P>
<P>
A future without the First Amendment's absolute guarantees can be glimpsed 
right now in Miami, where anti-pornography crusaders are embarked on a campaign 
against the rap music group 2 Live Crew. Rap is an art form whose aesthetic 
derives from the concerns, rhythms and linguistic distinctiveness of 
African-American street culture. It often deals explicitly with violence and 
sexuality. This has outraged Florida authorities, who convinced a federal judge 
to declare some of the group's song lyrics obscene. Armed with that ruling, 
they have arrested (in addition to a record store owner for selling a 2 Live 
Crew album) members of the band who performed material from the recording in a 
night club. In other words, American artists have been jailed for singing a 
song. 
</P>
<P>
The two centuries that have passed since a weary Madison unburdened himself to 
his great friend have taught us many lessons about self government. One of them 
is that liberty of thought and conscience -- and the freedom to express the 
ideas to which they give rise -- are the foundations upon which the edifice of 
American democracy rests.

L.A. BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FIGHT AGAINST REDISTRICTING DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In light of Judge Kenyon's decision regarding redistricting of county 
supervisor seats, the fight-to-the-end-at-all-cost attitude of the board's most 
recalcitrant member, Pete Schabarum, is as desperate as it is appalling (Metro, 
June 6). 
</P>
<P>
The time has long since passed for a more culturally diversified board; 
unfortunately, it will cost the county $3 million in legal fees (and more if 
they appeal) to do something it should have done voluntarily -- draw up 
districts which are not deliberately dissected to dilute the voting strength of 
any group. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's stubborn desire to appeal this case is sadly reminiscent of Gov. 
George Wallace's standing in front of the schoolhouse door in Alabama many 
years ago. Only now the words should be "gerrymandering today, gerrymandering 
tomorrow and gerrymandering forever!"

OIL RECYCLING BILL CALLS FOR DEPOSIT OF 5 CENTS A QUART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California motorists who change their own oil will have more legal places to 
dump the used black goo if legislation approved Monday in the Assembly becomes 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), would slap a 
nickel-a-quart surcharge on the sale of new motor oil and use the proceeds to 
entice service stations and oil-change specialists to accept used oil from the 
general public. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to do the right thing," Sher said. "But they don't have a way to 
conveniently or even feasibly dispose of their oil." 
</P>
<P>
The state's motorists generated 137 million gallons of used oil in 1988. But 
only 46% of that was recycled, according to a state study. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Sher said, is that the study shows 60% of car owners change their 
own oil and only 5% of them properly dispose of the used oil. 
</P>
<P>
The rest dump it into storm drains, stick it in their back yard, leave it 
alongside country roads or throw it in the household trash, which goes to a 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to require every business that sells motor oil to accept used oil have 
failed because of opposition from retailers unwilling to handle used oil from 
the public. Sher's bill is different because it relies on a financial incentive 
rather than a government mandate to get the service station and oil-change 
shops into the oil-collection business. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it would work: 
</P>
<P>
Oil manufacturers would have to pay five cents a quart, or 20 cents a gallon, 
into a state fund as a deposit on lubricating or industrial oil sold to dealers 
for resale in California. 
</P>
<P>
The surcharge is expected to be passed along to retail customers. 
Do-it-yourselfers who change their own oil could get their money back by taking 
their used oil to a state-certified oil-collection center. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who took their car to a service station or oil-change center would 
not get the refund. Instead, the company that changed the oil would get the 
money in return for agreeing to accept used oil from the public. The refunds 
are expected to generate several hundred dollars a month for the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't going to recycle their oil for the nickel, but the nickel is 
needed to provide the incentive to these companies to act as a collection point 
not only for their customers but for the general public," Sher said. "Some of 
these companies have to pay to have the oil hauled away." 
</P>
<P>
Any money paid into the state fund through deposits but not refunded to 
customers or the companies that change oil would be used to promote recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow big industrial users, including trucking companies that 
service their own vehicles, to recoup the deposit without opening their oil 
storage facilities to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the trucking industry opposes the bill, which passed the Assembly and 
was sent to the Senate on a bipartisan 50-18 vote. The measure is supported by 
Pennzoil, the giant oil company that recently purchased controlling interest in 
Jiffy Lube International, the franchiser of auto service stores. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans who usually oppose government intervention in business and 
industry voted for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has created the need to dispose of oil in special ways, yet 
we've made no provision to make disposal spots available to the people," said 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale). "We've made criminals out of normal people 
who are trying to maintain their cars. I want to make it as easy as possible 
for them to dispose of this stuff."

A former provincial governor serving a life term for murder led an attempted 
jailbreak, and five prisoners were killed in a shoot-out with guards. Another 
prisoner and three guards were wounded during the gun battle at the National 
Penitentiary in suburban Muntinlupa, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon said. 
The attempted break was led by former Nueva Vizcaya Gov. Orlando Dulay, who was 
serving a life term for killing three campaign workers of President Corazon 
Aquino before the February, 1986, presidential elections.

President Vaclav Havel will probably retain a former Communist as prime

Havel said in Prague. Marian Calfa turned in his Communist Party card after 
last winter's revolution, but his continued role as prime minister could draw 
criticism from Havel's allies and the Christian Democrats Havel hopes to 
include in a coalition government.

NEW LAWYER HIRED FOR BRANDO; 
</P>
<P>
KILLING: ATTORNEY DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEKING A PLEA BARGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Christian Brando, the son of actor Marlon Brando, may seek to strike a plea 
bargain with prosecutors to settle charges that he shot and killed the 
boyfriend of his pregnant half-sister, his lawyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While no plea bargain negotiations have begun, a defendant entering such a deal 
typically would either plead no contest to the charges or admit guilt to lesser 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the potential for a plea bargain came on the same day that criminal 
defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro announced that he has been hired by the 
defendant's father to replace civil rights lawyer William Kunstler as defense 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief court appearance by Christian Brando, 32, Shapiro said it was "a 
little premature" to hold plea bargain talks with prosecutors, but added, 
"We're leaving everything open. We're not eliminating any possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
He said the defense was conducting its own investigation of the case, in part 
so that "we will have all the facts," if plea bargain discussions begin. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said the defense investigation already has included a partial 
reconstruction of the crime scene by "the country's most respected 
criminalist." He declined to identify the specialist. 
</P>
<P>
A second autopsy commissioned by the defense supports Christian Brando's 
contention that the shooting was an accident, Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Kunstler, a longtime friend of Marlon Brando, is not 
experienced in murder cases and lost a bid on May 22 to have bail set for 
Christian Brando. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said Marlon Brando decided to hire him because he wanted a seasoned 
criminal defense lawyer whose practice is based in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think (Kunstler) was called in just for the initial stages of the 
case because of his relationship with Marlon," Shapiro said. He said Kunstler, 
who was not available for comment, will continue to act as an adviser in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando appeared in court Monday to schedule a preliminary hearing, 
but the judge postponed the scheduling until June 25 to give Shapiro more time 
to investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Brando is charged with shooting to death Dag Drollet, 26, the 
boyfriend of Cheyenne Brando, in her father's 12-room estate in the Santa 
Monica Mountains on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the shooting occurred after Christian Brando accused Drollet of 
beating his half-sister. Prosecutors said Drollet was shot in the back of the 
head while watching television. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando has admitted shooting Drollet, but said it was an accident 
that occurred while he and Drollet were wrestling for the weapon, a .45-caliber 
handgun, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Along with murder, Christian Brando, who remains in custody without bail, is 
charged with illegally possessing a machine gun and a silencer. He has pleaded 
innocent to all charges. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of first-degree murder, he could be sentenced to 25 years to life 
in state prison. Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty.

<P>
The recent reports of the Japanese being unwilling to fish for tuna in a 
dolphin-safe manner, plus their persistence in continuing to hunt whales while 
most other nations are willing to quit, leads one to think that, when the 
Japanese have finally killed the last two remaining whales in the ocean, they 
will go home, paint a delicate picture and write a gentle haiku: 
</P>
<P>
 We will miss the whale 
</P>
<P>
 He was a very good friend 
</P>
<P>
 Right up to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 And then they will convert their whaling vessels to magnificent and gigantic 
gill-net fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
And when they have caught the last tuna and killed the last dolphin, they will 
go home and paint a delicate picture and write a gentle haiku: 
</P>
<P>
 We will miss the fish 
</P>
<P>
 They were such very good friends 
</P>
<P>
 Right up to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, after all, the Japanese are people of great sensitivity and 
creativity, and it is only right and fitting that they honor such noble 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
And then they will convert their gill-net fishing vessels to . . .

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SETTING HIGH MARKS ON WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While other parts of the state have been forced to deal immediately with the 
dire consequences of the drought, Orange County for the most part has had the 
luxury of merely being concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county's underground reserves could buy it time, the Board of 
Supervisors and a number of municipal water districts have had the good sense 
to urge voluntary conservation measures now. But San Clemente, which like other 
places in South County has had rapid development in recent years, has been 
unique in its foresight. Its water-rationing plan, which goes into effect 
Friday, bears watching as a possible model for others at some future date. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago this month, officials of the Tri-Cities Municipal Water District -- 
which serves San Clemente, the Capistrano Beach district of Dana Point, San 
Onofre State Park and the San Onofre Nuclear Power Station -- decided they had 
seen enough when their reservoir plummeted in two months to less than half what 
it had been. Although the city expects to get eventual help from a $114-million 
South County pipeline project, it wisely decided not to wait. The city and 
water district set the stage for the rationing plan, a building moratorium, a 
new well and an agreement to reroute reclaimed water. The rationing plan in 
particular merits some attention outside San Clemente because of its 
reasonableness. Between Friday and Sept. 15, during the driest months, lawn 
watering will be permitted only on odd or even days, depending on residents' 
addresses. They will be limited to no more than 650 gallons a day, with fines 
for violators. Developers face restrictions, too. Tougher measures are planned 
if the level of the reservoir drops below specified levels. 
</P>
<P>
Other municipalities in Orange County may not need to take such steps at this 
point. But the lesson from San Clemente is that it makes no sense to wait until 
the well runs dry to institute tough conservation measures.

If the American voter ever decides that it is time to elect competent, mature

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Allan Malamud 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm amazed that people are asking me if Pat Riley was a good coach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The answer: Four NBA championships in nine seasons, seven Western Conference 
championships, a record 102 playoff victories, a record .733 regular-season 
winning percentage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he coached immensely talented teams. For eight of his nine seasons, he 
had both Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. But a lot of coaches wouldn't 
have been able to harness those egos or would have cramped their styles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Riley got out of Magic, Kareem, James Worthy and Byron Scott what director 
Francis Ford Coppola got out of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and 
Robert Duvall in the first two "Godfather" movies. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can coach ordinary players and get them to overachieve," a prominent 
college basketball coach told me recently. "It's much tougher to work well with 
stars. Riley did a remarkable job." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Riley didn't win any popularity contests with his players, but neither did John 
Wooden, Vince Lombardi or Casey Stengel. I mean, did Lombardi ever do lunch 
with Max McGee? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Under Riley, the Lakers accomplished what had been considered impossible in Los 
Angeles. A recent Times poll showed that more people cared about them than the 
Dodgers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So why the departure now? Nine years is long enough. People get on other 
people's nerves. Who knows, Coppola might not direct "Godfather X." . . . 
</P>
<P>
At 45, Riley is only three years younger than Red Auerbach was when he moved 
upstairs to the general manager's job at Boston after the 1965-66 season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Riley was merely Chick Hearn's yes man when he did color on the Laker 
broadcasts, but was exceptional as host of the recent HBO special, "The History 
of the NBA," and would figure to work well with either Marv Albert or Bob 
Costas at NBC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
NBC is going to televise Magic's annual summer benefit game at the Forum. What 
better way for Riley to debut? . . . 
</P>
<P>
I trust that Jerry West is as good a judge of young coaches as he is players 
and that he has made a wise choice in Mike Dunleavy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Better an eager guy with excellent credentials as an assistant than some 
retread. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dunleavy gave all the right answers at the Riley-out, Dunleavy-in press 
conference Monday at the Forum and was poised for somebody who hadn't been 
through this kind of thing before. . . .. 
</P>
<P>
The first proper move he can make is to keep assistant coaches Bill Bertka and 
Randy Pfund. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Dunleavy's challenge is enormous. Trades, perhaps a free-agent signing 
and the maturing of Vlade Divac could make the Lakers a better team than last 
season, when they had the best regular-season record in the league. But nobody 
will be able to dominate the Western Conference in the 1990s as the Lakers in 
the '80s because the competition is so much better now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Magic as player-coach was a lousy idea. He's got enough to do on the court. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Dunleavy and Billy Cunningham. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons never were more convincing than on Sunday, when they beat 
the Trail Blazers by 15 in Portland without the services of Dennis Rodman. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
I could have sworn Steve Wynn's $32-million purse bid for the cooled-off Buster 
Douglas-Evander Holyfield fight was a mirage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker, Tony Gwynn, Charles Smith, the Loyola Marymount basketball 
team, Don Drysdale, Jim Hill and the late Gene Klein will be honored Saturday 
night at the annual Cedars-Sinai Sports Spectacular at the Century Plaza. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Chris Evert was the better tennis player, but Mary Carillo is the better tennis 
commentator. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Tarkanian, who has never lost a game in Long Beach, will coach a team of 
celebrities against the Los Angeles Rams in a benefit for the Oralingua School 
for the Hearing Impaired Friday night at Cal State Long Beach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I've seen quicker knockouts, but never a quicker cut than Paul Gonzales 
received 30 seconds into his International Boxing Federation bantamweight title 
bout against Orlando Canizales Sunday in El Paso. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What Paul has to do now to get another title shot is become more active. 
Sixteen fights in six years aren't enough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's time for lightweight Todd Foster, who has 12 knockouts in 12 fights since 
the 1988 Olympic Games, to step up in class. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter is making San Diego's trade with Cleveland look good. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Would Roger Clemens have clunked Stanley Jefferson on the elbow if American 
League pitchers still batted and were personally subject to retaliation?

T-Bill Rates Higher at Auction: The Treasury sold $8.6 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.73%, up from 7.69% last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Another $8.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 7.64%, up from 7.62% the week before. The new discount rates understate 
the actual return to investors: 7.99% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 
bill selling for $9,804.60, and 8.06% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,613.80. The discount rate reflects the discount received when government 
securities are purchased at less than face value. In a separate report, the 
Federal Reserve reported that the average yield for one-year T-bills fell to 
8.08% last week from 8.18%.

30-POINT GAIN BREAKS DOW'S SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market snapped out of last week's slump Monday with a rally led by 
blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
But trading set its slowest pace in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down 38.59 points last week, rebounded 
30.19 to 2,892.57. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 918 up, 563 down and 516 unchanged. 
But Big Board volume totaled just 119.55 million shares, down from Friday's 
142.60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were doing selective bargain hunting in blue chips while 
awaiting a broad array of economic reports due this week. Among the monthly 
statistics on the agenda are the producer price index of finished goods, due on 
Thursday, and the consumer price index and the nation's trade balance, both on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as expected, brokers say, the data will support the popular view 
that economic growth is plodding along at a pace slow enough to permit 
inflation and interest rates to ease. 
</P>
<P>
However, they add, any surprises in the numbers could unsettle some of the 
optimism generated during the rally that recently carried stocks to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Dow's strength came from Boeing, up 3 1/2 to 58 1/2 on turnover of 
more than 2.3 million shares. The stock, which was split 3-for-2 with Monday's 
trading, responded to word of a $4.8-billion order from Korean Air Lines for 
747-400 jets. 
</P>
<P>
Energy stocks attracted buyers after dropping last week with falling oil 
prices. Exxon gained 7/8 to 47 7/8, Chevron added 1 1/8 to 70 5/8 and Arco rose 
2 to 116 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks were strong. Western Digital jumped 3/4 to 14 1/2, Intel rose 
1 to 47 1/2, Sun Microsystems added 1 to 31 5/8 and Amdahl rose 5/8 to 15 3/4. 
But Microcom tumbled 8 1/2 to 9 3/4 after projecting a loss for the current 
quarter, saying major domestic distributors were overstocked with its software 
and modem products. 
</P>
<P>
Some retailers rebounded from last week's slide. Gap added 1 7/8 to 58, Dayton 
Hudson jumped 1 1/4 to 73 3/8 and K mart rose 1/2 to 36 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Among Southland stocks up sharply, HomeFed gained 1 1/4 to 33 5/8, Teledyne 
rose 1 1/8 to 28, Syncor jumped 5/8 to 9 1/8, Standard Pacific rose 5/8 to 13 
1/4 and American Ecology soared 1 1/8 to 5 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed sharply lower as a weaker yen undercut the benchmark 
Nikkei average's 10-week climb from lows in April. The Nikkei tumbled 453.11, 
or 1.37%, to 32,540.18. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed lower on the London Stock Exchange, despite a surge on Wall 
Street. The Financial Times 100-share index ended 17.8 points lower at 2,348.8. 
In Frankfurt, stocks closed above their lows in very thin trading. The DAX 
index ended off 12.51 points at 1,809.66. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bond Prices Slip in Light Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices drifted slightly lower in very light volume as traders awaited 
government reports later this week that they hope will provide more direction 
for the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/16 point, or 63 cents per $1,000 
face amount. Its yield was 8.44%, virtually unchanged from late Friday. The 
prices of most shorter-term maturities were off slightly as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There was really no driving factor. It was very slow," said Raymond Stone, an 
analyst with Stone &amp; McCarthy Associates of Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
He said the market seemed to ignore a call by Federal Reserve governor Martha 
R. Seger that the central bank relax its monetary policy by the end of the 
year. Speaking Sunday at a meeting in Switzerland, she warned that keeping the 
money supply too tight could spark a recession. 
</P>
<P>
But her comment apparently did not excite the market because hers is a minority 
view, Stone said. Other Fed officials said just last week that the economy is 
faring well enough to keep interest rates where they are. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Declines Except Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
A lack of fresh economic news led to a slow day for currency traders Monday as 
the dollar was lower against most major currencies except the Japanese yen. 
Gold prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very quiet today, all day long," said Lorenzo Troni, vice president 
for foreign exchange at Paine Webber International in New York. "I think 
everyone is waiting for some economic data." 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.45 yen to a closing 154.10 yen. Later, in London, 
it was quoted at 154.45 yen. In New York, it climbed to 154.77 yen from 153.49 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One trader, Linda McLaughlin of Chemical Bank, attributed the dollar's strength 
against the yen to money from individual investors in Japan who have just 
received semiannual bonuses. The workers are apparently looking to invest in 
U.S. markets, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6858, stronger than $1.6843 late 
Friday. The pound traded at $1.6860 late Monday in New York, more expensive 
than $1.6840 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Corn, Soybeans Rise; Cocoa Futures Dive 
</P>
<P>
Corn and soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade 
after a slow opening. Analysts attributed the rebound largely to technical 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures also advanced while oats finished lower. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, energy futures were mixed; pork bellies surged; 
leading livestock and meat futures were higher; cocoa futures plummeted and 
precious metals rose. 
</P>
<P>
Corn futures settled 3 to 5.25 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in 
July at $2.8975 a bushel; soybeans were 6 to 10.50 cents higher, with July at 
$6.08.25 a bushel; wheat futures settled 1.25 to 4.50 cents higher, with July 
at $3.3275 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower across the board, with July at 
$1.4725 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said many of the large speculators who sold soybean contracts Friday 
returned Monday as buyers, helping to lift soybean prices to their highest 
levels in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The corn market extended a strong upward trend supported by last month's rain, 
which delayed planting, and by perceptions that corn supplies are unusually 
tight.

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: ANOREXIA IN TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I never realized how really dangerous an eating disorder could be 
until I read about anorexia in your column. Do these dangers apply to women of 
all ages? For example, if a teen-ager has an eating problem, isn't there a 
chance that she'll outgrow it? I would imagine that anorexia in a teen-ager 
would not be as serious a condition as it would be in an older woman. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The results of a study conducted by researchers from the University of 
Rochester (N.Y.) Medical Center tend to support your view. They report that 
most adolescent girls who develop anorexia nervosa respond to treatment with a 
return to their normal weight; fewer than 15 percent of those studied had a 
continuing problem related to their eating disorder. Moreover, neither their 
educational nor employment accomplishments were affected by the disorder.

DANCE MAKING STRIDES IN S.D.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's lively arts scene has shaken its backwater reputation and turned in 
some fine performances over the past few years. Local theaters have sent shows 
to Broadway. Internationally known actors, musicians, singers and conductors 
are regularly drawn to perform with San Diego groups. 
</P>
<P>
But dance, traditionally the stepsister of San Diego arts, has not kept pace 
with the rest of the family. 
</P>
<P>
The genre, however, between new blood and the old guard, is making gains. 
</P>
<P>
Malashock Dance and Company, the new kid on the block, is a chamber-sized, 
modern dance group -- the brainchild of former Twyla Tharp hotshot John 
Malashock. It has made giant strides since its official debut in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the company went to Los Angeles and San Francisco, besides 
performances on its home turf. And Malashock's emotionally charged, 
no-holds-barred choreographic style received rave reviews on all fronts. Next 
season should bring even wider recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"I foresee an increase in touring, but our plans for New York exposure may have 
to wait another year," said Malashock. "We had a budget of $85,000 this year, 
and I can't even afford to stay at our present level if we don't increase that 
this year. We have a pretty even mix of earned income, private donations and 
public money, but, if the city funds dry up, it can be a disaster for a small 
company." 
</P>
<P>
But that fiscal uncertainty isn't stopping Malashock from gearing up for 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planning a fall and spring season and considering larger venues here," 
he said. "We'll keep the company at about six or seven dancers, with at least 
two men (including Malashock). We don't want to get too large, or become a 
million-dollar organization right away. That's unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
Another contender and the longest-running hit on the modern dance scene is 
Three's Company. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old troupe has a strong following in San Diego and is building 
audiences in the Bay Area and several Western cities. Summer workshops and 
performances in Europe have also helped its visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Three's Company was the first local company to take on the toughest test of a 
dance troupe's mettle -- a New York debut -- and was well received by audiences 
and critics. Two dance videos made in conjunction with KPBS also have enhanced 
the company's national image, and a third is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
This year, with a newly renovated studio at its disposal, the troupe is banking 
on more low-tech performances on the home front in addition to its annual run 
at the Mandell Weiss Center, and more touring close to home. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably won't be able to afford a New York trip for at least another 
year," said artistic director Jean Isaacs. "Everybody would like to do more 
touring, but these are really bad times. Probably all of us in the arts will be 
in holding patterns." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the company intends to keep a small nucleus of dancers on salary 
for a 20-week season (as it did last year). Its artistic focus remains zeroed 
in on the work of Isaacs and Nancy McCaleb, a course it has followed for 
several seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In a more classical vein, California Ballet, the granddaddy of San Diego-based 
dance companies, has the distinction of being the most popular purveyor of "The 
Nutcracker" in this neck of the woods, although it rarely attracts serious 
attention for its repertory concerts. Its other claim to fame is home-grown 
dancer Denise Dabrowski, a virtuoso ballerina who makes frequent appearances 
with Three's Company as well. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old ballet company has the strongest ties with the Soviet Union of 
any local troupe -- and perhaps any dance group in the country. Under Maxine 
Mahon's direction, the California Ballet broke new ground in 1986 by snaring a 
Soviet danseur (Stanislav Issaev) for a guest spot in its own ranks, and the 
parade of Soviet dancers has never ceased. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Mahon is in Leningrad for a teaching workshop, and a cultural exchange 
plan with the Soviets (which will bring a Soviet dancer to San Diego this fall) 
is still intact. San Diego-trained Calvin Kitten, who just completed his 
exchange year with the Leningrad troupe, will be back with California Ballet 
when the season opens in September. 
</P>
<P>
California Ballet will offer a three-concert season this year, compared to four 
last year, and will continue to import guest artists, largely because of its 
shortage of male dancers. 
</P>
<P>
The American Ballet Ensemble, led by former Balanchine ballerina Lynda Yourth, 
is the other ballet company based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
ABE performs in several San Diego venues, and frequently takes its productions 
to Tijuana and Mexicali. The dancers average 15 to 16 years of age, but are 
generally well-trained. This year, three of them (Aura Dixon, Claire Taber, and 
Christopher MacDougell) took part in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're constantly expanding," said Yourth. "We're still doing two major 
concerts here, but we'll be doing quite a lot of touring. We think our 
home-grown dancers are as good as most of the ones we can bring in, but we'll 
use guests when we need them next season." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz Unlimited got the jump on jazz dance years ago, and it remains the only 
serious choice for contemporary jazz, pop, and funk-oriented audiences. The 
company is still seeking the right balance between its recent focus on softer, 
modern-based movement and the stereotypically high-voltage jazz that has been 
its calling card for years. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe continues to test the waters, however, with director Patricia Rincon 
beginning to tap her Mexican heritage for more dramatic story-based dances. 
Plans for collaborations with visual artists and musicians are also on the 
drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
Funding limitations will keep Jazz Unlimited close to home this year for a 
three-concert season. But a teaching-performing liaison in Europe has led to a 
Jazz Unlimited-offspring, Rincon Dance Company, and that will tour in 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a company in Europe that performs in the summer," said Rincon. "They're 
dancers I trained there over the years, and if it flies, I'll be able to feed 
in my own dancers there. Right now, I'm using it as an experimental company. I 
can set avant-garde pieces, or anything I want there. I'm not labeled as we are 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The local community also abounds with independent artists who create and 
perform in low-tech environments, often with support from the San Diego Area 
Dance Alliance, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity 
of local dance. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance has not lived up to its potential, but it has contributed 
significantly to the well-being of the dance community by providing limited 
financial support, performing space, and other services. Ellen Segal, Laurie 
Lowery and Judith Sharp are some of the beneficiaries of alliance grants. 
</P>
<P>
University-based dance is alive but not completely well. United States 
International University's International Ballet survived the university's close 
call with bankruptcy, but as Steven Wistrich, director of the ballet program, 
noted: 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know whether we'll get any scholarships for next year, and 
without them, we may lose some of our students. That would affect the quality. 
We have to work with the people who are here, and we're not able to apply for 
any public funding. But we're negotiating with the new Poway Arts Center for 
performing dates in the fall and spring, and we plan to perform in Tijuana in 
the winter." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State University has been a minor player on the concert scene for 
years, although it has a good track record for feeding dancers into the 
community. Patricia Sandback of the SDSU dance faculty said the department 
should make strides in the coming year, now that it has a degree program in 
dance to attract serious students. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego and Palomar College showcase student dancers and faculty work 
regularly, and both institutions expect to continue performing at the same 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
For ethnic dance, San Diego is home to a variety of troupes, most of which 
operate on the fringe of the dance community. Samahan Dance Company and the 
Pasacat troupe -- both specialists in Philippine dance forms -- are the most 
prominent.

set on high visibility in San Diego and recognition beyond the county line.

Food Fight: A group of NBC employees is engaged in a petition drive to save its 
blue collar, family styled commissary, the butt of many a Johnny Carson barb. 
As of July 16, a new, fancier dining service with a new, fancier and presumably 
pricier menu will be installed at the network's Burbank home. 
</P>
<P>
According to menus obtained by The Times, the new dining service will serve 
such yup-scale dishes as "Southwestern charbroiled chicken breast with blue 
corn pancakes" and "black fettucini and mixed seafood with tequila lime butter 
sauce." The current commissary serves such delicacies as chef's salad, bacon 
cheeseburger and cake. The petition expresses satisfaction with the current 
"staff, food, prices and services" and protests any changes in this area. GREG

A New 'Today': With little hoopla, lots of smiles and Willard Scott joking 
about the bald pate of Joe Garagiola, NBC's "Today" show on Monday began what 
it hopes will prove a fresh start after nearly a year of woe. 
</P>
<P>
Although heavily promoted by NBC during the weekend, the new-look "Today" was 
oddly low-key as Bryant Gumbel and co-anchor Deborah Norville welcomed 
Garagiola, the show's co-host from 1969 to 1973 and now its second co-anchor. 
There were no speeches, no recap by anchor Gumbel of the problems that led to 
Jane Pauley's departure in December, no on-air hugging by Norville. Last 
December, Norville embraced Pauley after Pauley wished her well when Pauley 
left the show. GREG BRAXTON

Kennedy Crest?: After twice failing the New York Bar exam and having it 
splashed across the front pages of the state's newspapers, John F. Kennedy Jr. 
may have felt as if his life were a soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
Now he may star in one. The only son of slain President John F. Kennedy is "in 
serious negotiations" for a starring role in an upcoming soap opera titled 
"Families," said the show's executive producer, Ruben Malaret. "He's taking the 
bar in July and if he fails the exam, he's moving to the West Coast." GREG

PIANIST MARCUS ROBERTS BRINGS RAINBOW OF STYLES TO NEW GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago Marcus Roberts, then 21, joined the Wynton Marsalis group as 
pianist and composer. Roberts, who was heard last year at Hollywood's Vine 
Street Bar &amp; Grill during a leave of absence, has now left Marsalis 
permanently and returned to Vine Street last week leading a unit that is 
similar to the one he presented previously. 
</P>
<P>
There is one important difference: This is a sextet instead of a quintet, 
enabling him to bring greater harmonic complexity to his arrangements and to 
move with ease through a rainbow of stylistic variations. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who will play Wednesday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, is 
able, within a single set, to move from the starkly basic (his first blues riff 
tune could have been written and played in the 1950s) to the deeply subtle and 
spiritual, as in his majestic interpretation of an old Duke Ellington piano 
solo, "Single Petal of a Rose." 
</P>
<P>
The musicians he has assembled are young and, for the most part, mature beyond 
their ages. Roberts is the oldest; the youngest is trumpeter Nicholas Payton, 
16, out of school for the summer and already wise in the ways of such long-ago 
giants as Cootie Williams, whose plunger-muted sound he simulated on one of the 
less-complicated blues pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Payton, who has not developed a distinctive sound on open horn, seemed hesitant 
at times. The other trumpeter, Scotty Barnhart, has already evolved into a 
warmly communicative artist, while the tenor saxophonist, Herb Harris III, 
displays an emotional and technical firmness of purpose rare in such a young 
man. 
</P>
<P>
What impresses most about these three horn players is that they are not the 
products of some college band cookie-cutter process that churns out hundreds of 
graduates, too many of whom are long on technique and short on aesthetic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The bass player, Chris Thomas, and the drummer, Martin Butler, seem well 
attuned to the leader's requirements, such as the constant need to swing and 
the ability to enrich the overall sound. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Roberts' repertoire at the show consisted of variations on the 12-bar 
blues, but each number found a different way to disguise, extend or modify that 
ancient form, sometimes using a Middle Eastern flavor as in "Nebuchadnezzar," 
by changing keys as in "E. Dankworth," or by the use of tension and release for 
dynamic and rhythmic contrast. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' eclecticism is amazing. On Duke Ellington's "Black and Tan Fantasy" he 
began with an almost exact recreation of the composer's original 1927 piano 
solo, yet a few minutes later he moved into a florid, lightning-pace passage 
that had 1990 written all over it. The contrast was almost too sharp, like 
beginning to write an impression of a Hemingway essay and suddenly evolving 
into James Joyce; but Roberts finally is never dull. 
</P>
<P>
This sextet may take time to develop a full measure of cohesion, but already it 
provides its brilliant leader with the type of showcase his chameleonic talents 
require. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Marcus Roberts plays Wednesday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $13.50. Information: (714) 
496-8930.

RICK DU BROW: TARTIKOFF: THE EDUCATION OF A YALE MAN 
</P>

TV or not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
THE RAVAGES OF AGE: Pretty strong blast by NBC's Brandon Tartikoff against Fox. 
</P>
<P>
But why? 
</P>
<P>
I mean, we really try to understand things like why he'd say Fox Broadcasting 
panders to the "worst aspects" of viewers. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Fox has aired "The Simpsons," "The Tracey Ullman Show," "It's Garry 
Shandling's Show," "In Living Color," "Cops" and "Alien Nation." 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a network that's less than four years old. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we're getting there. 
</P>
<P>
First, Tartikoff, a refined fellow who studied under Robert Penn Warren ("All 
the King's Men") at Yale, is also a fierce fighter. His NBC network is No. 1, 
he has no match as a programmer and he hates to lose. 
</P>
<P>
So perhaps Fox should take the blast as a compliment. No one bothers attacking 
a weak competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Fox does put on a lot of greasy kid's stuff, since its target audience 
is between 18 and 34 years old. 
</P>
<P>
And, well, we hate to say it, but Tartikoff -- a boy wonder when he became the 
president of NBC Entertainment 10 years ago -- is now 41. 
</P>
<P>
He's suddenly the grand old man of network programmers. Before you know it, 
he'll be giving up softball for golf and subscribing to Modern Maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Greasy kid's stuff can indeed get on one's nerves. But appealing to viewers' 
worst aspects is not exactly exclusive to Fox: It was NBC that put on Geraldo 
Rivera's satanism special and the "Favorite Son" miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tartikoff loves to put on the gloves. And then there's the optimistic 
view: After his decade atop the TV dogfight, we may finally be learning -- from 
his reaction to the greasy kid's stuff -- that you can take the boy out of Yale 
but you can't take Yale out of the boy. 
</P>
<P>
We like happy endings. 
</P>
<P>
ROCK AROUND THE COP: Steven Bochco's new musical drama series for ABC, "Cop 
Rock," is the best argument yet for stereo TV. 
</P>
<P>
The way to watch it is loud, to get the full effect. 
</P>
<P>
We managed a look at the hour pilot for the fall police show with music (by 
Randy Newman), and if any new series is going to rouse debate, it's this one. 
</P>
<P>
"You may hate it," producer Bochco has said, knowing he's venturing into an 
offbeat concept for viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. But you may well love it, too. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to figure why people think a musical drama series is far out for TV. The 
form certainly isn't new to theater or movies. Is it that we're conditioned to 
sameness and mediocrity by the networks? If so, then we're in TV's hip pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks" broke the rules, and it's exciting. So were several wonderful PBS 
miniseries that integrated music, fantasy and drama -- "The Singing Detective" 
and "Pennies From Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
And "Cop Rock," kind of a "Hill Street Blues" with music, should create 
excitement too. 
</P>
<P>
The key will be whether consistently good musical numbers can be composed each 
week -- especially with Newman gone after the first show. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a full table," Bochco says. 
</P>
<P>
It's a little early -- but keep an eye out for the premiere. 
</P>
<P>
And turn up the volume. 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL DELIVERY: What a remarkably tasteful and buoyant episode of a pregnancy 
exam last weekend on Lifetime's "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd." Molly 
(Blair Brown) looks fine with her added weight. And -- speaking of music -- 
there it was again as her late father materialized and sang to her as she sat 
on a park bench. Very charming. 
</P>
<P>
SUMMER AND SMOKE: Yes, indeed, says ABC -- "Twin Peaks" will open its new 
season with a two-hour special following a late-summer rerun of the series. 
</P>
<P>
NEW AGE: How has ABC changed? Well, a decade ago, its big Saturday-night tandem 
was "The Love Boat" and "Fantasy Island." This fall, it's "China Beach" and 
"Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
DOWNSIDE: Alas, says ABC, Dr. Ruth (Westheimer) got pink-slipped for her 
proposed new-season sitcom. The pilot of "Dr. Ruth's House," in which she plays 
a university professor who shares her home with five students, airs on ABC June 
22. And then, says a network spokesman, it's all over. 
</P>
<P>
THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT: The show business coverage on KTTV Channel 11's nightly 
news is by far the best turned out by a local TV station. There's some real 
reporting instead of just the usual rundowns on openings and electronic press 
releases from the studios. 
</P>
<P>
MAN ABOUT TOWN: Next to Stan Chambers of KTLA Channel 5, is there a better 
all-purpose reporter on local TV than Phil Shuman of KNBC Channel 4? Out on the 
street, filling in on sports -- or whatever -- he's a very workmanlike fellow. 
No slop, no sentiment, no small talk. 
</P>
<P>
UPDATE: Gay-bashing is the subject of CBS' "48 Hours" on Thursday. CBS, of 
course, is the network that took heat from the gay community for Andy Rooney's 
comments about homosexuals. Hmmm. Well, let's just assume "48 Hours" is 
tackling the subject simply because it's deeply disturbing and, unfortunately, 
very timely. 
</P>
<P>
TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY: Morton Downey Jr., one-time symbol of "trash TV," has 
a couple of gigs on NBC. He'll be a panelist on this fall's daytime revival of 
"To Tell the Truth." And he'll appear in the Mary Tyler Moore-Tony Curtis TV 
movie comedy "Thanksgiving Day." There's no business like show business. Right? 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: David Letterman says he woke up in a cold sweat: "I dreamed I was 
in one of those Dockers commercials." 
</P>
<P>
Say good night, Gracie. . . .

RISK OF TANKER BREAKING UP IN GULF INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
GALVESTON, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Waves began breaking over the stern of the burning supertanker Mega Borg on 
Monday, increasing the risk that the ship, carrying 38 million gallons of light 
crude oil, might break up and sink in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 gallons of crude already lost from the tanker formed an 
oil slick three miles long and 200 feet wide surrounded by a lighter sheen 10 
miles long and 600 feet wide, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed environmentalists were contemplating how to protect birds and other 
wildlife as the oil slick spread. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, tanker salvagers were stymied on two fronts. Special 
firefighting equipment from Holland did not arrive on time and flames leaping 
ever higher on the water's surface made it impossible to spray the stern with 
fire-retardant foam. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a good sign," Petty Officer Mark Sedwick, a Coast Guard spokesman in 
Galveston, said of the latest bad news about the Mega Borg. The tanker was 
carrying three times more oil than the Exxon Valdez held when it ran aground 
off Alaska in March, 1989, and caused the nation's worst oil spill. The Mega 
Borg was 57 miles offshore in 130 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were standing by with 50 tons of chemical foam, which they said 
could be used effectively only after the scope of the fire is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The drama of saving the Mega Borg from sinking began Saturday, after an 
explosion rocked the tanker in the early morning as it was transferring oil to 
a smaller vessel bound for the port of Houston. Two Mega Borg crewmen were 
killed and two others are missing and presumed dead. The cause of the explosion 
is undetermined. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, round-the-clock effort has been required to keep the tanker afloat 
and intact. As the days have worn on, firefighters have been unable to gain a 
toehold and, in fact, have lost ground in the race to avert environmental 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, the salvage operation was dealt a major blow when five 
explosions rocked the stern of the ship, already racked by fire for 24 hours. 
Since then, the news has been mostly bad. The secondary explosions caused at 
least one cargo tank to spring a leak and send burning oil off the stern and 
into the water. After the later explosions, the tanker started to list. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday night, the Coast Guard -- which was overseeing but not participating 
in the firefighting -- said that a final effort to douse the flames could be 
expected to begin early Monday. But that time came and went because the 
fire-fighting equipment ordered from Rotterdam had not yet arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said that very little of the kind of equipment needed to 
fight such a fire was available in the United States because most oil ship 
fires take place in the North Sea and Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Rear Adm. William Merlin defended the time taken to assemble the 
firefighting equipment from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very specialized business requiring very specialized equipment," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Monday morning, Coast Guard Capt. Tom Greene said there 
was still three feet of freeboard at the stern and that the tanker had not sunk 
substantially overnight. 
</P>
<P>
That changed, though, as the stern gradually dropped lower in the water, at 
least partly due to the weight of the water being sprayed on it by fireboats. 
An effort to begin foaming was halted when a new fire broke out on the port 
side of the ship. Those flames were quickly beaten back, but the scenario was 
changing once again. 
</P>
<P>
Because the stern was lower in the water, Sedwick said, more oil was rolling 
out of the ship. 
</P>
<P>
"(Sinking) has increased the amount of oil leaving the vessel," he said. 
"You've got higher flames because it is fueling the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Sedwick said the spreading fire further forced crews to delay applying the 
foam. 
</P>
<P>
As the dangerous waiting game went on, fireboats continued to douse the tanker 
to cool its superstructure and knock back the flames as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Smit America, the salvage operator hired by the tanker's Norwegian owners, has 
said it expected to have the fires under control about an hour after the 
foaming began. The company also said it would not begin that work until 
conditions were right and that that would not be before this morning. 
</P>
<P>
While the Mega Borg was carrying three times as much oil as the Exxon Valdez, 
its cargo was a different variety. The oil on the Mega Borg was light crude, 
which disperses much faster by evaporation. Capt. Greene said Monday that the 
oil already spewed from the tanker probably would not reach Texas beaches 
because of the prevailing currents in the Gulf. He also said that light crude 
oil is considerably more toxic than the heavier oil carried by the Exxon 
Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists worried about what might happen in the worst-case situation 
-- if the tanker should sink and lose all its cargo. 
</P>
<P>
The spill would come at the peak nesting season for thousands of gulls and 
terns along the Texas coast. A spokesman for the Sierra Club said efforts were 
already under way to mobilize volunteers should an oil slick affect shore 
birds' habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more concerned with the direct toxic effects with fish and shellfish," 
said David Sager of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. "And we always 
have concern for the sea turtles." 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Merlin said that the salvagers hoped to extinguish the fire and then 
stabilize the tanker in the water. He said that could be accomplished fairly 
quickly by shifting water sprayed into the pump room to a forward compartment 
in the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he said, the oil remaining in the Mega Borg could be transferred to other 
tankers brought alongside -- the process that was in progress when the first 
explosion occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Before that can be done, the fire would have to be extinguished. To do so will 
require that firefighters first spray foam from boats, then board the tanker 
and battle the flames from room to room. 
</P>
<P>
"The first priority is to gain control and put out the fire," Merlin said.

AZUSA -- AFTER THE BULLDOZERS; 
</P>
<P>
THE CITY FATHERS FORESAW PROSPERITY WHEN CHANGE BEGAN COMING TO THE SLEEPY 
LITTLE FARM TOWN AFTER WORLD WAR II. BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Environmental change -- from polluted streams to congested highways and 
overdeveloped land -- is affecting the quality of life across the nation. Such 
change is gradual and often goes unnoticed while it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 To measure how various areas have been affected over the decades, The Times 
dispatched reporters to the places where they grew up. This occasional series 
of articles examines how our hometown environments have been altered -- for 
better or for worse. 
</P>
<P>
Things were pretty quiet in Azusa during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
It was a typical Southern California farm town in those days -- mostly oranges, 
with a scattering of lemons, avocados and row crops. The biggest thrill at my 
grammar school was watching the city fathers climb the wooden tower in a corner 
of the schoolyard to look for Japanese warplanes. Of course, they never spotted 
any. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Azusa was attractive then. Lush orchards. Clear skies. The 
unspoiled San Gabriel Mountains just to the north. Streets lined with palm, 
eucalyptus and pepper trees. Sprawling farmhouses in the groves. Tidy homes set 
comfortably on spacious, shaded lots in much of the town. And most of the faces 
were familiar. 
</P>
<P>
The real excitement began about 10 years later, when, as teen-agers, we watched 
in awe as bulldozers rooted out the orchards, where we'd worked as farmhands, 
and tore away the surrounding brushlands, where we'd hunted jack rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
The rural countryside we'd roamed so freely was soon replaced with asphalt 
parking lots, tacky shopping centers and mean little tract houses so small that 
some of them were hauled in on the backs of flatbed trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it was ugly. Yes, there was dust, trash and something new blurring the 
sky, called smog. And when we walked up Azusa Avenue -- past the Safeway 
market, Richter's Drugstore, the First National Bank and Leo Nasser's Men's 
Store -- we saw a lot of faces we'd never seen before. 
</P>
<P>
But the city fathers pointed out that the downtown business section was 
thriving. 
</P>
<P>
They spoke of the new brewery and manufacturing plants on the west side of 
town, near the old gravel pits. They counted the traffic jamming Highway 66, 
right through the center of town. And they bragged that the way things were 
going, Azusa would soon be the giant of the San Gabriel Valley -- bustling, 
prosperous and handsome in a new, different sort of way. 
</P>
<P>
But something went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding communities like Glendora, West Covina and Duarte grew and went on 
to become pleasant and successful suburban bedroom communities, with busy 
downtown business districts. Azusa grew and went on to industrialize, but the 
heart of the town went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Highway 66 was replaced by a freeway that skirted local businesses. The 
downtown section, once a fertile hubbub of small offices and retailers, 
withered into a wasteland of pawnshops, shuttered stores, abandoned shopping 
centers and vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
And as the economy sagged, so did the environment. Smog stayed. Buildings aged 
without dignity, as porches sagged, siding cracked and paint faded. Trash piled 
up -- on purpose this time, in one of the old gravel pits. The pristine front 
of the San Gabriel Mountains was scarred by quarrying. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Moses, Azusa's mayor, says the town is starting a comeback. He says 
investors are ready, and revitalization of the downtown area is just around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials have said such things before. 
</P>
<P>
According to local historians, the first known residents of the area were 
Shoshone Indians who threw up a few brush huts and dubbed their village 
Asuksa-gna. Early records indicate the name translates to something like "skunk 
place." Whatever it meant, the early Spanish settlers adopted a variant, 
referring to the place as El Susa. 
</P>
<P>
The lands, which eventually became known as the Rancho Azusa, fell under the 
general purview of the mission at San Gabriel in 1771. Probably used for 
livestock grazing, the rancho, then about 10,000 acres, was eventually sold in 
1844 to an ambitious young Englishman named Henry Dalton. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton converted the ranch into a successful farming operation, digging 
irrigation ditches to carry the clean, plentiful water in from the nearby San 
Gabriel River. He planted grains, laid out orchards, put in vineyards and built 
a flour mill. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1850s, Dalton drew up a town site to be called Benton, but no lots were 
ever sold. About 20 years later, an attempt was made to create another town, to 
be called Mound City. It, too, came to naught. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1884, land speculator Jonathan Sayre Slauson acquired the 4,431 
acres that remained of Rancho Azusa. His timing was excellent. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe railroad was building a line to Los Angeles, 30 miles to the west, 
that would pass right through the middle of the rancho. Southern California's 
first major land boom was on, and Slauson was ready to cash in on it. In the 
spring of 1887, he drew up a third set of plans for a town, this one to be 
called Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the long hours of the night previous and until 9 o'clock on the day of 
the sale, a line of hungry and weary lot-buyers stood in front of the office 
where the lots for Azusa were to be sold," J. M. Guinn wrote in his "History of 
Los Angeles and Environs." 
</P>
<P>
"Number Two claimed to have been offered $1,000 for his place in line; Number 
Fifty-Four loudly proclaimed that he would not take less than a cool hundred 
for his chance," Guinn said, writing of an era when a dollar a day was 
considered adequate wages. 
</P>
<P>
"Two hundred and eighty thousand dollars' worth of lots were sold that first 
day," he added. "Not one in ten of the purchasers had seen the townsite." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, despite the same sort of promotional hyperbole that saw so many other 
Southern California boom towns of the 1880s vanish without a trace, Azusa 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been the fortuitous combination of water, soil and climate that 
made the orange groves, planted there over the next 70 years, flourish and 
prosper. It could have been the presence of the railroad, and later, Highway 66 
-- two of the nation's principal transportation arteries. 
</P>
<P>
The population grew from about 800 at the time of incorporation in 1888 to 
about 5,200 in 1942, the year I started attending Center School, a three-room 
elementary school in the orange-ranching district southeast of town. 
</P>
<P>
There were two of us in the first grade when classes began that fall -- myself 
and Hank LeMay. Charlene Mitchell and Roderick Abbott showed up by 
Christmastime. That made four of us in an area of about three square miles that 
today has a first-grade enrollment of about 360. 
</P>
<P>
We were a simple ethnic mix in 1942 -- we Anglo kids, whose fathers mostly 
owned the orange groves, and the Latino kids, whose fathers mostly labored in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
We got along fine, doing the same sort of things -- collecting newspapers for 
the war drive, doing chores in the groves, exploring the unspoiled Angeles 
National Forest just north of Azusa, heading into the center of town on 
weekends for movies or a swim in the municipal plunge. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a difference. 
</P>
<P>
We did most of these things apart, we children of different nationalities. And 
while not much privilege was available in Azusa in those days, what there was 
went to us Anglo kids. 
</P>
<P>
We Anglos wandered into town confident of welcome wherever we went, whether it 
was Richter's Drugstore, where a woman named Sibyl dished out ice cream on a 
marble countertop, or the Azusa Theater, where we screamed ourselves hoarse 
over Roy Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Contreras, a contemporary of mine, remembers "feeling separate." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the comfortably spacious, Spanish-style farmhouse that I grew up in, 
Contreras, now 50, grew up in a cramped, clapboard bungalow in the "barrio" on 
the south end of town. Most of the streets down there weren't paved in those 
days, and the little house he was born in -- his grandfather's, just around the 
corner -- lacked electricity and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went downtown, we felt people were looking at us; like, what were we 
doing there," Contreras recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the movies at the parish hall, where they were in Spanish," he 
said. "We only went to the plunge on Saturdays, and the next day they drained 
the water out and refilled it. They didn't tell us we had to do it that way, it 
was just understood. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents taught me to accept things like that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Tony and I, along with George Hutton-Potts and most of the other boys we knew, 
worked on the ranches during the summers when we were teen-agers. The hours 
were long and the pay wasn't much, but it was outdoor work, and we liked it. 
</P>
<P>
Tony irrigated and picked oranges, I sprayed weed-oil and hauled fruit and 
George sold corn at a stand alongside Highway 66 at the Foothill Ranch, where 
Tony's father and grandfather, and my father and grandfather, had worked before 
us. 
</P>
<P>
Once a year, I'd take a Model A Ford pickup out along the ranch's mile of 
frontage on Highway 66 to pick up trash. That year's worth of trash would only 
half-fill the little pickup. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill Ranch was still about 750 acres in those days -- more than 350 of 
it in oranges -- and as late as 1949, the first year I worked there, we were 
still planting new orchards. It seemed as though the agricultural life, 
centered south and east of town, would go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
And Azusa had a burgeoning industrial base, too, in what had been the largely 
empty brushlands west of the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the rock-crusher pits, which had been there for years, there 
were the Aerojet and American Cyanamid plants, which had sprung to life during 
the war and were continuing to prosper. Lucky Lager built a brewery out there 
to take advantage of the excellent and plentiful well water pumped from the 
wash lands beside the river. 
</P>
<P>
A brochure printed by the city in 1950 referred to Azusa as "the industrial 
giant of the San Gabriel Valley." 
</P>
<P>
It was about then that George Hutton-Potts' family sold its 25-acre grove for 
part of the Azusa area's first postwar residential subdivision, called 
Valleydale. The builders weren't thinking about charm or space or 
craftsmanship, they were thinking about quick sales to World War II veterans 
short on cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget quality," said Leo Nasser, a 77-year-old haberdasher who has been 
selling Azusans their "dress-up" clothes for 59 years. "They put one nail in 
where they should have put in three. But the houses were cheap. And they sold. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"Then people got the idea that every residential area had to have a shopping 
center," Nasser said. "And pretty soon those were all over the place, too." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, as more orange groves were plowed under and more houses were 
tacked up, the shopping centers did pretty well -- well enough to drain the old 
downtown area of the retail business that had kept it alive for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the death of the downtown area in the 1960s and '70s was hastened by a 
decision to make Azusa Avenue -- the town's principal north-south artery, 
leading to the recreation areas in San Gabriel Canyon -- a one-way street. Some 
say it was an unwillingness to invest the sort of money needed to keep up. Some 
say it was political bickering and a lack of planning. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, Richter's Drugstore, the Safeway and a lot of the other 
downtown stores became vacant, and eventually were razed. Many were replaced by 
vacant lots. A few were replaced by new structures, now housing pawnshops, gun 
stores and the like. Some of the replacement buildings are now empty, too. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Nasser hung on, in the menswear shop that still sports the decor he 
installed in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his clientele are in their 60s now, and the few who drop by do so as 
much to socialize as to buy anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I know them all personally," Nasser said. "If I get four or five of those 
people in here a day, that's what makes me happy." 
</P>
<P>
He gazed across the street, where a jewelry store, electric appliance shop and 
two drugstores have been replaced by an empty lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Business used to be terrific around here," he said quietly. "It's a ghost 
town, now." By the mid-1970s, some of Azusa's shopping centers began to die, 
too, as residents were attracted by newer, larger, more attractive malls in 
neighboring towns. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Square, created in the 1950s out of an orange grove across the street 
from George Hutton-Potts' house on Alosta, had boasted in 1960 of "sixteen 
shops, including a major supermarket." Not to mention the first McDonald's 
hamburger joint anywhere around. 
</P>
<P>
Today, even the McDonald's has fled, to a couple of outlets farther out of 
town. Azusa Square now claims one seedy old bowling alley and three or four 
marginal shops, surrounded by about 10 acres of crumbling pavement. 
</P>
<P>
If the Azusa of today is plagued with one lasting curse, it is smog. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa doesn't create it all, of course. Most of the smog is generated 30 miles 
to the west, in the Los Angeles area. The stuff drifts east each afternoon on 
the prevailing breezes from the ocean, to be trapped above Azusa -- and a 
number of neighboring communities -- by the broad barrier of the San Gabriel 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Moses argues, with some justification, that Azusa became unfairly known 
as smog city because for years the Southern California Air Quality Management 
District had a measuring station there and the Azusa readings were among the 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
Moses says the smog in Glendora and other nearby communities is just as bad. 
He's probably right, but that doesn't make the smog in Azusa any better. It 
still discolors lettuce in residents' vegetable gardens and causes the bloom to 
drop from back-yard fruit trees. And if George and Tony and I remember 
correctly, the skies had been pretty blue when we were kids. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill Shopping Center fronts about an eighth of a mile of the old 
highway. Nowadays, they vacuum up more trash at that shopping center in a week 
than I used to shovel up from a mile of that highway in a year. 
</P>
<P>
They use one of the old rock-crusher pits west of town these days as a landfill 
for trash. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, despite protests from local water officials and environmentalists 
that the dump threatened the safety of water already polluted by industrial 
waste from other sources, the state Water Resources Control Board authorized 
expansion of the landfill to accept another 36 million tons of trash. 
</P>
<P>
Browning Ferris Industries, which operates the dump, says the installation of 
high-density plastic liners in the pits and the construction of a complex 
drainage system will prevent further pollution. The local officials aren't 
convinced. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, the Azusa Rock Co. confined its quarrying operations to pits that, 
despite their size, are all but invisible, except from the air. A couple of 
years ago, acting under permits granted by the city back in the 1950s, the 
company started gnawing away at the face of the mountains above Azusa, creating 
an 800-foot scar that is visible for miles. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, a judge ruled against environmentalists who sought to block 
further mining. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa isn't even vaguely rural any more. What once was an identifiable town, 
surrounded by farms and open land, is now just another part of the great, 
urban, Los Angeles metropolitan sprawl that stretches unbroken almost 60 miles 
east from Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The last of the orange groves in Azusa have disappeared, although a few of the 
original trees still survive in back yards. 
</P>
<P>
The only agricultural operation of any consequence is the approximately 
500-acre stump end of the Foothill Ranch, now home to the Monrovia Nursery, one 
of the largest commercial nurseries in the world. In recent years, the nursery 
has been planning to move. The land would be developed for housing and 
business. 
</P>
<P>
While successors to Aerojet and American Cyanamid are still in Azusa, the 
brewery is gone, sold to Miller Brewing Co. and relocated in nearby Irwindale. 
Other, smaller businesses, many of them quite prosperous, have filled in the 
rest of the wash lands west of town, but for some reason, none of that has 
rubbed off downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa today has about eight times as many residents as it did the year I 
entered grammar school. 
</P>
<P>
The streets are paved in the old barrio section now, with electricity and 
plumbing everywhere in town. But while there's no identifiable slum in Azusa, 
there's no identifiably posh area, either. 
</P>
<P>
Local realtors say that while the most expensive houses in Azusa peak at about 
$350,000, top homes in Glendora, the town immediately to the east, command 
prices as high as $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa's mayor, Moses, says 55% of his city's residents are renters -- "and 
that's probably the highest rate in the county." He says the high rental rate 
makes for a highly transient population, "and that's part of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
And even a lot of us whose families had never been renters -- people like 
George Hutton-Potts and Tommy Graning and Eddie Tyck and me -- chose to move 
elsewhere when we grew to adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Tyck and I ended up in Glendora, where there was more of the grace and space we 
had remembered from our childhoods. Graning ended up in the high desert, where 
there was even more room. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton-Potts fled Azusa for the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to live in all that smog," he said. "I wanted air. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And besides that, I didn't like what had become of Azusa," he said. "It was 
crowded with unpleasant little houses. It wasn't the vibrant little town it had 
been. It was a shabby little town." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, people like Leo Nasser and Tony Contreras chose to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this place, and my roots are here," Contreras said. "But when I was a 
kid, we had a town, and now it's just a place to live. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hell of a lot quieter, now. When you don't have a town, it's quiet."

POINDEXTER GIVEN 6 MONTHS IN PRISON; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: THE FORMER REAGAN AIDE RECEIVES THE HARSHEST SENTENCE OF THE SEVEN 
CONVICTED IN THE SCANDAL. THE JUDGE CITES THE DEFENDANT'S LACK OF REMORSE.

<P>
John M. Poindexter, the highest-ranking former official convicted in the 
Iran-Contra scandal, was sentenced Monday to six months in prison after a judge 
said that he had sought to "nullify" the actions of Congress and had shown no 
remorse. 
</P>
<P>
The former national security adviser in the Ronald Reagan White House was the 
only one of seven convicted in the scandal to receive a prison term. The 
others, including two former White House officials, were placed on probation or 
required to perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
The retired rear admiral, standing ramrod straight before U.S. District Judge 
Harold H. Greene, looked grim and pursed his lips on hearing the sentence. But 
he managed a faint smile as he walked to embrace his wife, Linda, in the front 
row of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to speak with reporters and drove off with his lawyers after briefly 
thanking a group of flag-waving supporters who demonstrated outside the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Greene allowed Poindexter to remain free until a ruling on his appeal, which is 
likely to occur next year. The judge did not impose any fine, noting that 
Poindexter already had incurred large legal bills. Navy spokesmen have said 
that Poindexter's pension, which is about $55,000 a year, will not be affected 
by his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Dan K. Webb, the associate independent counsel who prosecuted the case, told 
reporters later that the sentence was "very fair and very proper." Webb said 
that it should alert other public officials that "when you serve in high 
government office . . . you must do so with the highest levels of integrity and 
honesty." 
</P>
<P>
Before sentencing, Poindexter's lead attorney argued that "what he did, he did 
for his country." 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, who did not take the witness stand at his trial, faced a maximum 
sentence of 25 years in prison and fines of $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan refused to comment on the sentence, according to his press secretary, 
Mark Weinberg, in Los Angeles. The former President gave videotaped testimony 
that was presented at the trial in which he said that he had never authorized 
anyone to break the law and did not, in fact, believe any laws had been 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
Before imposing sentence, Greene told Poindexter that decisions of Congress 
cannot be "nullified by appointed officials." Congress voted in 1984 to cut off 
military aid to rebel forces in Nicaragua. Greene said that, by lying and 
obstructing congressional inquiries about the National Security Council's 
involvement in supplying arms to the Contras in Nicaragua, Poindexter had 
sought to "invalidate the decisions made by elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
A jury last April found Poindexter, 53, guilty on five felony charges for 
seeking to conceal from Congress that a subordinate, Oliver L. North, was 
secretly violating a congressional ban by raising funds for the Contras and 
supplying them with weapons. Jurors found that Poindexter had also obstructed 
congressional efforts to learn about covert U.S. arms sales to Iran and 
diversion of the profits to benefit the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
After calling Poindexter's offenses serious and noting that he had shown no 
remorse, Greene said: "Congress is entitled to accurate and complete 
information and cannot fulfill its constitutional duties without it." 
</P>
<P>
Greene said that the defendant had conducted his scheme "for a lengthy period 
of time" and, along with North, had "engaged in the destruction of evidence," 
including 5,000 computer memos dealing with the Nicaraguan supply mission and a 
presidential authorization for shipping arms to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The judge noted that, under new federal sentencing guidelines, Poindexter would 
have received a prison term of 21 to 27 months. But the guidelines do not apply 
to such crimes committed before 1987, and a sentence of that length would be 
unfair because six other defendants received probation from other judges, 
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
He took note also of Poindexter's 33 years of military and government service. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Greene said, a prison term is necessary to deter other high 
government officials from considering perjury. 
</P>
<P>
Before delivering his lecture, Greene listened to a plea for leniency by 
Richard W. Beckler, Poindexter's chief defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Greene asked Poindexter if he wished to speak himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Your honor, I don't have any comment," the defendant replied. 
</P>
<P>
Beckler called Poindexter "an honorable person" and pointed out that he had 
received "no personal gain, no personal profit" from any of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Webb conceded that Poindexter, who resigned from the White House when the 
Iran-Contra scandal broke in November, 1986, had been "a well-respected public 
official in one of the highest positions of government." 
</P>
<P>
After remarking on Poindexter's "brilliance" and the fact that he had been 
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at the top of his class, Webb told the 
court: "Except for the events of this case, I don't quarrel with his 33 years 
of service to his country." 
</P>
<P>
But Webb said that the defendant's five felony convictions showed that "John 
Poindexter was carrying out presidential policies at all costs. He accepted 
that the end justified the means. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a malevolent or evil man in any way," Webb continued. But, because 
his crimes "undermined the very fabric of our government," a prison sentence 
must be given, he told the court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA DEFENDANTS 
</P>
<P>
John Poindexter, former national security adviser, convicted April 7 of 
conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false 
statements in connection with Reagan Administration assistance to the Contras 
and a November, 1985 shipment of missiles to Iran. He was sentenced Monday to 
six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver North, former National Security Council aide, was found guilty in May, 
1989, of three felonies -- aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress, 
destroying official documents and accepting an illegal gratuity -- and 
sentenced to two years probation, fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 
hours of community service. He is appealing while serving the community service 
in an anti-drug program. 
</P>
<P>
Robert McFarlane, former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to four 
misdemeanors of withholding information from Congress by denying that the NSC 
staff was soliciting support for the Contras' military activities and helping 
move supplies to the rebels and denying that he knew anything about 
other-country financing of the Contras. He was placed on two years probation, 
fined $20,000 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded guilty Nov. 8 to 
lying to congressional investigators when he said he wasn't aware of any money 
that went to the benefit of North from the maze of companies known as "the 
enterprise," which Secord had used in the Iran-Contra affair. Secord on Jan. 24 
was sentenced to two years probation. 
</P>
<P>
Carl (Spitz) Channell, pleaded guilty to using his nonprofit National Endowment 
for the Preservation of Liberty to raise more than $2 million to buy weapons 
for the Nicaraguan rebels. He was sentenced to two years probation for 
conspiring to defraud the Treasury of taxes due on the money raised with 
North's assistance. He died last month. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Miller, head of a Washington public relations company, pleaded guilty 
to conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service of taxes on contributions 
used to supply military aid to the Contras. He was sentenced to two years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Hakim, an Iranian-born businessman who with Secord ran "the enterprise," 
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of aiding and abetting in supplementing North's 
income by paying for a security fence at North's home. Hakim was fined $5,000 
and sentenced to two years probation Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica, is charged with 
obstruction and making false statements in connection with his assistance to 
North's Contra resupply network. The judge in the case said the charges must be 
dismissed due to the attorney general's ban on the use of classified material 
Fernandez needs for his defense. Prosecutors are appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Clines, former CIA agent, was indicted for allegedly failing to report 
to the IRS some of his income he received for working for North's Contra 
resupply network. Clines, a business partner of Secord and Hakim, has pleaded 
innocent and is scheduled to go on trial Sept. 4.

PROP. 115 MAY PROVE FAULTY, OFFICIALS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
INITIATIVES: PROVISIONS OF UNHERALDED PROPOSITION 114 COULD INVALIDATE 
DEATH-PENALTY EXPANSION OF BETTER-KNOWN BALLOT MEASURE. 
</P>

<P>
A little-noticed measure adopted in the June 5 primary may have inadvertently 
eliminated parts of a major expansion of the death penalty included in 
Proposition 115, the sweeping anti-crime initiative, top law enforcement 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 114, which drew only minimal attention during the campaign, made a 
relatively small change in the law but retained other portions of the state's 
capital punishment statutes that Proposition 115, backed by prosecutors and 
crime victims, meant to change. 
</P>
<P>
But under the state Constitution, Proposition 114 would take precedence if the 
courts find a conflict between the two because it drew more votes than 
Proposition 115. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they expected defense lawyers to challenge provisions of 
Proposition 115 that widened the law to allow the death penalty for the murder 
of a witness in a juvenile proceeding; for accomplices who, while not actual 
killers, act as "major participants" in felony-murders; and for killings during 
commission of mayhem and rape by an instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"We are warning district attorneys of the possibility that if they charge the 
death penalty under those parts of Proposition 115, they should understand 
those charges are at risk and their cases could be delayed while the issue is 
litigated in the courts," said state Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Richard B. 
Iglehart. "But we also feel that the two measures can be harmonized and that 
the courts will find they are not in conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Canlis, executive director of the California Dist. Attys. Assn., 
acknowledged there was an "unfortunate technical possibility" the two 
propositions could be found in conflict. But, she added, she expected the 
death-penalty expansion mandated under Proposition 115 would ultimately be 
upheld. 
</P>
<P>
The new questions raised about the broad anti-crime initiative came as a 
surprise to several attorneys on both sides of the Proposition 115 campaign. 
Apparently, the issue was not raised publicly before the election. Iglehart 
said lawyers on the attorney general's staff had discovered the potential 
conflict a few weeks ago and now are advising local officials of its potential 
implications. 
</P>
<P>
One principal spokesman for the initiative voiced confidence that there was no 
conflict between the two initiatives and that the death-penalty expansion in 
Proposition 115 was not in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this as being any kind of a problem," said Los Angeles Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Albert H. MacKenzie. "I think we have a lot of lawyers getting out 
their magnifying glasses and trying to find flaws." 
</P>
<P>
But several defense lawyers who opposed Proposition 115 said Monday they now 
believe there is a good possibility that the passage of Proposition 114 had 
overridden some of the capital provisions of the better-known measure. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been running amok with these ballot propositions," said Ephraim 
Margolin, a San Francisco defense attorney. "If ever there was an example of 
how you can kick yourself in the butt, applying a meat cleaver instead of a 
scalpel, this is it." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 114, which received 71% of the vote, called for expanding a 
provision that permits the death penalty for murder of a peace officer. The 
provision was redefined to include new categories of such officers now 
recognized by other laws. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to expanding the death penalty, Proposition 115, which drew 53% of 
the vote, limited the rights of criminal defendants to those required under the 
federal Constitution, created a new crime covering torture, and enacted several 
provisions designed to reduce delay in the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also contained other death-penalty provisions -- such as one that 
limits a judge's ability to reverse a jury's finding of capital murder -- that 
amend other laws.

ASSEMBLY OKS BILL CRACKING DOWN ON SWEATSHOP ABUSES; 
</P>
<P>
GARMENT INDUSTRY: MANUFACTURERS WOULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR LABOR AND SAFETY 
VIOLATIONS COMMITTED BY SUBCONTRACTORS.

<P>
The Assembly on Monday approved a bill that would crack down on the latest 
proliferation of garment industry sweatshops in Orange and Los Angeles counties 
by making designer-name garment houses responsible for child labor and overtime 
abuses committed by their independent suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles), was 
introduced in March after a series of articles in The Times revealed that many 
independent contractors run sweatshops paying as little as $1.45 an hour to 
children and immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
It will be sent to the Senate for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the bill, name-brand clothing manufacturers would be held 
"jointly liable" for labor and safety violations committed by their 
subcontractors, many of whom pay immigrant children and women by the piece of 
clothing sewn in their homes or in crowded, fire-prone shops. Depending on the 
complexity of the job and the speed of the stitcher, the piece rate often 
translates into less than the California minimum wage of $4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, these independent jobbers have avoided paying fines simply by 
folding their operations when cited by state labor officials, leaving many of 
the exploited workers stranded without even their meager pay. Hayden's bill 
would change that by placing the burden of the fines and back pay on the 
manufacturers who hired the independent jobbers. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden and supporters of the bill -- the California Labor Federation and the 
International Ladies Garments Workers Union -- say the change is necessary 
because of widespread labor abuses.

"This is an industry where there's a lot of documented lawlessness -- 
child-labor violations, unsafe working conditions, fire hazards, people not 
getting paid what they deserve," Hayden said. "And it's the very structure of 
the industry that's out of control." 
</P>
<P>
"This (the bill) is to make the manufacturer liable for the rampant lawlessness 
instead of what they now do, which is reap the benefit but take none of the 
burden," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed 44 to 30, received support from Assemblywoman Lucille 
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), whose district encompasses the downtown Los 
Angeles garment district. "On any given day, you can go to any one of these 
buildings and see the most deplorable working conditions imaginable," she said, 
adding that some shops have structural problems, blocked exits and piles of 
flammable materials. 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who said he was equally opposed 
to the labor abuses even though he joined fellow Republicans in opposing the 
measure, maintained that the Hayden bill would place an inappropriate burden on 
the manufacturers.

BUSH, REAGAN, FORD TO ATTEND OPENING OF THE NIXON LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
President Bush and his two Republican predecessors will join Richard M. Nixon 
next month for the opening of his long-awaited presidential library in Yorba 
Linda as the political thaw surrounding the Watergate President continues, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter, the only Democrat elected President since Nixon resigned in 1974, 
sent his regrets. A spokeswoman said Carter wanted to attend the July 19 event 
but has a previous commitment. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion will be the first meeting of the four living Republican presidents 
since Bush was elected. Nixon's ailing wife, Pat, also is expected to make her 
first public appearance since leaving the White House in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"We already have a tremendously exciting event," said Hugh Hewitt, director of 
the Nixon library foundation. "Everything else is just gravy." 
</P>
<P>
The library dedication, which will be open to the public, is scheduled for 9 
a.m. on the site where Nixon was born in 1913 near a citrus grove in a tiny 
white clapboard house. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 people also are invited to a private, black-tie dinner at the 
Century Plaza. It was unclear whether Bush or former Presidents Ronald Reagan 
and Gerald Ford planned to attend both events. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt said the White House had not yet officially confirmed that Bush would 
attend the dedication, but an Administration official told The Times that Bush 
was going. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon has enjoyed a return to the public spotlight because of a new book he has 
written on Watergate, a planned public television appearance and a visit to 
Washington where he was heralded as an elder statesman. The presence of Bush, 
Reagan and Ford also represents an easing in the attitude of elected officials 
toward the former President. 
</P>
<P>
The privately funded $21-million library is scheduled to open July 20 -- almost 
17 years after Nixon left office. In contrast, the Carter and Ford libraries 
are already operating; Reagan's is under construction and scheduled to open 
next February in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's 84,000-square-foot library will contain no original papers from his 
years in the White House. Instead, it will house copies of documents from his 
presidential term, as well as materials from his terms in Congress and as vice 
president, plus book manuscripts, private papers and White House diaries.

LAKER, RAPPER TEAM UP TO CARRY ANTI-SMOKING MESSAGE TO BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laker forward Orlando Woolridge and the rap musician Deezer D will help carry 
the state health department's anti-smoking message to young blacks in an 
advertising campaign beginning this week, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, state health 
director, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The series of television, radio and billboard advertisements directed at blacks 
is part of the California Department of Health Services's $28.6-million 
anti-smoking media campaign initiated in April to attempt to curb smoking among 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The program, funded by Proposition 99 cigarette tax revenues, has attracted 
national attention for its provocative advertising designed to counter 
tobacco-industry ads aimed at vulnerable groups, such as young people and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The new spots, created by the Los Angeles-based advertising firm of Muse 
Cordero Chen, attempt to dispel the image that smoking is glamorous, Kizer said 
at a briefing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In one advertisement that will be posted in bus-stop shelters, a picture of 
Woolridge dunking a basketball is accompanied by the message, "If you want to 
smoke on the court . . . don't smoke off the court!" 
</P>
<P>
In a billboard advertisement slated for predominantly black neighborhoods, a 
photograph of a coffin carries the headline: "Cigarette Companies Are Making a 
Killing Off You." 
</P>
<P>
But the campaign's heaviest artillery is a rap music video mocking the tobacco 
industry, starring Deezer D and directed by dancer Debbie Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"The next time you buy a pack, think about my rap. . . . We used to pick it. 
Now they want us to smoke it. Yeah right, you must be jokin', " Deezer D 
exhorts as dancers participate in a mock funeral and choke on cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of some public-service announcements, the spots represent 
paid advertisement for television and radio audiences statewide. Officials said 
they hope the rap video receives national exposure on Music Television. The 
hard-hitting messages are necessary because of the tobacco industry's practice 
of targeting minorities in advertising, Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fighting fire with fire," Kizer said. "There is no doubt that the 
smoking rate is higher among minorities than it is for whites. This didn't 
happen by accident. It's the result of many years of carefully crafted 
advertising geared toward blacks and other minorities." 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1989 surgeon general's report, minority groups suffer from a 
disproportionate share of smoking-related, ailments such as chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Blacks suffer a 
lung-cancer rate 58% higher than whites, Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
While smoking rates for blacks have declined at rates similar to whites, black 
male smokers still outnumber white male smokers, 41% to 31%. More than 40% of 
black males over the age of 20 smoke, Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
However, tobacco industry officials have repeatedly dismissed the charge that 
they are targeting their products to specific groups and, Monday, questioned 
the need for education aimed at a particular group. 
</P>
<P>
"Adults, regardless of race, are capable of making their own decisions," said 
Andrew White, a spokesman for the cigarette maker Philip Morris USA. "I think 
many blacks might take offense at being placed in a protective class simply 
because some people in state government have taken a paternalistic attitude 
toward them." 
</P>
<P>
But Kizer said that the advertising campaign, which is part of a $220-million 
anti-smoking education program funded by Proposition 99, has received favorable 
public response, with letters of approval outnumbering criticism 7 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Health and Human Services today will unveil 
anti-smoking advertisements aimed at Spanish-speaking individuals. Ads 
targeting Asian-Americans will begin airing later this month.

WOMEN FLOCK FOR DOCKWORKER JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: SETTLEMENT OF A DISCRIMINATION SUIT WILL OPEN UP 350 POSITIONS FOR 
THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of women are crowding employment offices and union halls near the Los 
Angeles and Long Beach harbors to vie for 350 part-time dockworker jobs set 
aside for women as part of a settlement of a decade-old discrimination lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
State employment and shipping industry officials said Monday they had run out 
of 2,500 application cards and were printing as many as 4,000 additional cards 
to be made available today at seven locations. 
</P>
<P>
"The more applicants the merrier," said Vince Lamaestra, labor relations 
administrator for the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents the ports' 
terminal operators. 
</P>
<P>
Lamaestra's attitude belies years of acrimony over employment opportunities, 
particularly for women, on the docks of what, in the case of Los Angeles, is 
now the nation's busiest harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began in 1980 when a handful of women, most of them daughters 
of longshoremen, filed a class-action lawsuit to protest hiring practices for 
dock clerks. The suit, expanded to include the hiring of women as longshore 
workers, was settled in 1982 by agreement among the plaintiffs who sued the 
maritime association and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's 
Union, Local 13. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which was last modified in March, requires that women be hired 
to fill 35% of part-time dockworker jobs and 17.5% of the full-time dock work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
This month's hiring of 350 women will bring the number of part-time, or 
"casual," workers in the harbor area to nearly 1,500. The part-time employees 
earn $14 an hour and work when there are not enough full-time laborers 
available on the docks. 
</P>
<P>
The positions will be filled in a June 22 lottery among qualified applicants. 
</P>
<P>
While the work is sporadic, part-timers can earn raises as they build up their 
hours. They also enhance their chances to become full-time dockworkers, whose 
salaries average $50,000 a year, plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, a similar drawing for 350 dock jobs drew more than 40,000 men 
and women who lined up for miles to get a shot at high-paying, full-time jobs 
at the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the 1984 lottery, which drew applicants from as far away as New York, 
this month's drawing has been planned to avoid unruly crowds and long lines. In 
1984, for example, the applications all were made available at one location -- 
a San Pedro drive-in theater -- resulting in a line of cars that stretched 10 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was madness. No one wants to go through anything like that again," said 
Lamaestra. 
</P>
<P>
The request cards for employment are available at three state Employment 
Development Department offices: 23820 S. Avalon Blvd., Carson; 1313 Pine Ave., 
Long Beach, and 1940 N. Bullis Road, Compton. 
</P>
<P>
They also are available at the Pacific Maritime Assn. office, 100 W. Broadway, 
Suite 3000, Long Beach; and three Wilmington locations: the Longshore Casual 
Hall, 721 N. Broad Ave.; the Longshore Dispatch Hall, 343 N. Broad Ave., and 
the Marine Clerks Dispatch Hall, 707 W. C St. 
</P>
<P>
The cards must be returned to one of the three EDD offices by 3 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants must be at least 18 years old. They must read and write English and 
pass both a physical examination and a strength and agility test. A drug and 
alcohol screening test also will be given to all applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The drawing for openings will be held at the union's business office, 221 W. C 
St., Wilmington.

POLICE RESCUE TWO KIDNAPED WOMEN HELD FOR RANSOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG and JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police foiled a kidnap-for-ransom plot early Monday, rescuing two women who had 
been held blindfolded all night and arresting four suspects -- some of them 
members of a Crips gang -- who allegedly abducted the two and demanded more 
than $100,000 from relatives for their safe return. 
</P>
<P>
The victims -- Rhonda Ervin, 26, and Toni Merceron, 27 -- were rescued at 6 
a.m. by undercover Los Angeles police officers who had stationed themselves 
near the intersection of Manchester Avenue and Avalon Boulevard in South Los 
Angeles, where the kidnapers believed the ransom exchange was going to take 
place. The officers found the women unharmed in the back of a van driven by one 
of the abductors. 
</P>
<P>
The women were kidnaped shortly before 10 p.m. Sunday night from Ervin's 
apartment on 91st Street in South Los Angeles and taken to an unknown location 
where they were held for eight hours, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A group of men, armed and wearing ski masks, had broken into the apartment and 
were waiting for the women when they, along with Ervin's boyfriend, returned 
home from a day at Lake Hughes, according to police and Merceron. The men 
forced the women to lie face-down on the floor and covered their heads with ski 
masks. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in the house, turned on the lights and there was a bunch of folks 
there who said, 'OK, everybody get on the floor,' " said LAPD Detective Lou 
Boozell. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the boyfriend, Zarricor Glasper, 26, escaped by jumping off a 
balcony outside a second-story window. But the women were blindfolded, put 
inside a van and driven to another apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Said Merceron: "They told us to lie down on our stomachs with our heads down 
and they said, 'Don't say anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe that as many as seven men were involved in the 
kidnaping and that some, if not all, were gang members, although they do not 
believe the incident was a case of gang rivalry. The other kidnapers were still 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
Police also said they believe Ervin was the main target of the kidnaping. Asked 
about a possible motive, Boozell said, "greed, money, dope, whatever they could 
get their hands on." Merceron said Ervin's apartment had been ransacked and 
that both women were robbed of jewelry and that Ervin also lost a telephone 
pager. 
</P>
<P>
Although Boozell said Ervin believed the kidnapers abducted her by mistake, the 
men apparently knew Ervin's family. According to Merceron, the kidnapers 
telephoned her friend's mother several times and threatened to kill the women 
if Ervin's mother did not come up with the cash. 
</P>
<P>
"At 4 a.m. they woke us up," Merceron said. "They had called the family 
demanding money. . . . They told us that if the family didn't have the money by 
the time the street lights were off, they would kill us. We kept asking them: 
'Was the family cooperating?' They told us not to worry." 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol from the alleged kidnapers 
but would not release the names or ages of any of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Two of them were arrested shortly after the kidnaping, at about 11:30 p.m. 
Sunday, when LAPD patrolmen stopped their car. The third was arrested at his 
apartment in the Avalon Gardens housing complex after a woman who had been sent 
by the kidnapers to pick up the ransom money was taken into custody and tipped 
police off to his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth was arrested at the scene of the supposed ransom exchange, when 
members of the LAPD's Special Investigations Section stopped his van and found 
the women inside. 
</P>
<P>
The SIS squad is a special undercover surveillance unit that focuses on 
dangerous criminals. In a widely publicized case, six of its members were 
cleared in federal court last week of allegations that they violated a bank 
robbers' civil rights when they shot her and killed her companion during a 
robbery in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a good job," Jim Bryan, the LAPD robbery-homicide detective who 
handled the kidnaping investigation, said of the SIS' efforts Monday. "They got 
four individuals in custody and nobody was shot. . . ."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 26 YOUTHS SUE OFFICERS, CITY OVER PARK 
INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for 26 black and Latino youths who contend that Los Angeles police 
officers earlier this year physically and verbally abused them for nearly two 
hours at a state park in Pacific Palisades on Monday filed a $5.2-million 
federal civil rights lawsuit against the officers and the city. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks $2.6 million in general damages and an equal amount in punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
It names as defendants the city, three officers and two unnamed park rangers 
who allegedly looked on as the officers forced the youths at gunpoint to lie 
face down on the ground for interrogation. The incident, which allegedly 
occurred Feb. 12 at Will Rogers State Historic Park, was racially motivated, 
said Carol Watson, an attorney for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials have said that an internal investigation is under way in 
connection with the incident. LAPD representatives would not comment Monday on 
the incident or the suit.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONTENDER FOR MALIBU SEAT LEAVES HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A contender for a contested seat on Malibu's future City Council who suffered a 
mild stroke last Friday was reported to be in good condition Monday after being 
released from Santa Monica Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Merrick, 71, a retired Municipal Court judge, was resting comfortably 
at home after his release from the hospital, his wife, Marge, said. 
</P>
<P>
Merrick was said to be trailing slow-growth activist Missy Zeitsoff by a single 
vote Monday, with an unknown number of absentee and write-in ballots from last 
week's incorporation election yet to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to approving cityhood by a wide margin, Malibu voters chose a 
five-member council. But the race between Zeitsoff and Merrick for the fifth 
seat on the council continued to be so close that a spokesman for the Los 
Angeles County registrar's office said it may be Thursday before the winner is 
known.

DEPUTY ACCUSED OF KILLING GIRLFRIEND HAS BAIL RAISED TO $500,000, IS BACK IN 
JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy, who had been free on $25,000 bail after being charged with 
the June 2 fatal shooting of his girlfriend, was remanded into custody Monday, 
with bail reset at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond me how bail could be set at $25,000," said Los Angeles Municipal 
Judge Candace Beason. "The gravity of the offense dictates that it should be 
substantially higher." 
</P>
<P>
The judge noted that the district attorney's office had not been notified of 
the deviation from usual bail, nor had the court commissioner who originally 
set bail specified any reason for the low amount. 
</P>
<P>
William Joseph Burke, 30, a six-year veteran deputy most recently assigned to 
the sheriff's West Hollywood station, is accused of shooting his girlfriend, 
Brenda Berndt, 25, in the face during an argument in his mobile home on 
Heathercliff Road in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph Shidler had asked that Burke be 
held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Burke posted the $25,000 two days after his arrest, prompting an outcry from 
the victim's family and friends, who say he was treated leniently because he is 
a law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Marlon Brando's son," said Berndt's stepfather, David Arney of 
Palmdale. "He got no bail. But Bill (Burke) slides through -- because he's a 
deputy. Even now they (Burke's family) can raise bail." 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Commissioner William Jacobson did not return reporters' calls 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay speculated that Burke's "cooperation 
(with investigators), coupled with longstanding ties to the community and a 
lack of previous criminal record probably led the commissioner to grant his 
release." 
</P>
<P>
Burke's father, Patrick, is also a sheriff's deputy, assigned to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant showed no emotion and said nothing as he was escorted out of 
Beason's downtown courtroom Monday on his way to Men's Central Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother, Candy Arney, close to tears, said afterward that she is 
"not happy with even $500,000 bail. This possibly could be raised. I do not 
want him out; I want him to get what he deserves. We don't have a daughter 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
She said her daughter met Burke at the Pitchess Honor Rancho, a county jail 
facility, where Burke had been assigned and Berndt worked as a payroll 
timekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
The Arneys say they had tried to discourage the romance, saying the defendant 
had "violent tendencies." 
</P>
<P>
For example, they said, Burke once told them about his participation in a 
beating incident at the jail. And when the couple broke up in 1988, the Arneys 
recalled, Burke "grabbed her and threw her against a wall, causing her to 
tumble down the stairs, and then ran over her things (with his car)." 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, however, the Arneys said Burke began courting their 
daughter again, deluging her with phone calls and flowers. She had just 
announced that she was moving in with the deputy the afternoon before her 
death, they said. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Burke's parents gave him a birthday party. The invited guests 
included Burke's ex-wife and three other girlfriends, one of whom claimed he 
had fathered her child. 
</P>
<P>
That made Brenda mad and they started arguing, the Arneys said investigators 
told them. 
</P>
<P>

BRANDO SON GETS NEW LAWYER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DEFENSE VETERAN ROBERT SHAPIRO HOPES TO SETTLE MURDER CASE WITHOUT 
TRIAL.

<P>
The son of actor Marlon Brando, facing a murder charge in the shooting death of 
his half-sister's lover, switched lawyers Monday, replacing civil rights 
attorney William Kunstler with noted criminal defense counsel Robert L. 
Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said he will meet with prosecutors to try to resolve the Christian 
Brando case without a trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a horrible human event," Shapiro said of the fatal shooting last month of 
Dag Drollet. "Both Dag's father and Marlon are soon to be grandfathers of the 
same child," he said, adding that both families have been devastated by the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, is pregnant with Drollet's child. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro, who formerly represented Beverly Hills murder defendant Erik Menendez, 
said he will handle the bulk of the case, with Kunstler, of New York, a Brando 
family friend, continuing as "senior adviser." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Stormer, Brando's previous Los Angeles attorney, has been released, Shapiro 
said. Neither Kunstler nor Stormer are experienced in handling murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said the elder Brando hired him to represent Christian because the 
actor wanted a seasoned criminal defense lawyer whose practice is based in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Brando, 32, appeared briefly in a West Los Angeles courtroom Monday 
to schedule a preliminary hearing, but legal proceedings were postponed until 
June 25 while defense experts reconstruct the murder scene at his father's 
Mulholland Drive estate and conduct a second autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Drollet's parents attended the hearing, but the elder Brando was not present. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a white shirt, tan slacks and handcuffs, the defendant bowed his head, 
answering "yes" twice in a husky voice when asked if he agreed to a new lawyer 
and postponement of the proceeding to set a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very sad, very depressed, very emotional and very scared," Shapiro said 
outside court. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney added that, while it is "a little premature" to hold plea bargain 
talks with prosecutors, he hopes to settle the case without a preliminary 
hearing or trial. Typical plea bargain arrangements involve a defendant 
pleading no contest to the charges, or admitting guilt to lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
Brando is charged with shooting Drollet, 26, whom Brando says he suspected of 
beating his half-sister. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Drollet was shot in the back of the head while watching 
television. 
</P>
<P>
But Brando, who has admitted the shooting to police, maintains it was an 
accident that occurred while the two were wrestling for a .45-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Along with murder, Christian Brando, who remains in custody without bail, is 
charged with illegally possessing a machine gun and a silencer. He has pleaded 
innocent to all charges. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of first-degree murder, Brando could be sentenced to 25 years to 
life in state prison. Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty.

BUSINESSMAN SHOT DEAD OUTSIDE HOME; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: POLICE SAY THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A STRUGGLE IN THE DRIVEWAY. THEY HAVE NO 
SUSPECTS AND NO MOTIVE IN SAN MARINO'S FIRST MURDER IN MORE THAN 10 YEARS.

<P>
A Taiwanese businessman was shot to death early Monday after a struggle in the 
driveway of his San Marino home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide detectives, who were called by local 
police to investigate the slaying, said the motive for the attack in the 1300 
block of Bradbury Road was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor heard a car drive away moments after three shots were fired, 
investigators said. But no suspects were identified or in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the 43-year-old victim, whose name was withheld pending 
notification of relatives, ran an import-export business in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino police said it was the first homicide in the quiet, upscale San 
Gabriel Valley community since a service station attendant was killed in 1979 
during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor, who asked that she not be identified, said the victim and his 
wife had purchased the property about six months ago, but didn't move into the 
home until a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very nice and friendly," the neighbor said. "They always waved 
'Hello.' " 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victim apparently had driven home, parked his car at the rear 
of the house and was walking back along the driveway toward the front of the 
property when he was confronted by one or more assailants. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor, who had gone to bed several hours earlier, said she was awakened 
by the sound of three gunshots at 12:21 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I heard the sound of a car driving away," the neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators said a San Marino police officer, who happened to be 
patrolling in the area, heard the shots but arrived too late to see the 
departing car. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor said she did not see the car either. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said evidence indicated that there had been a struggle before the 
three shots were fired. A wallet containing cash was found on the victim's 
body, but detectives did not rule out the possibility of a robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
They said the victim's wife was not at home at the time of the shooting.

SANTA CLARITA, BUILDERS EXCHANGE ACCUSATIONS OVER STALLED PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tensions between Santa Clarita and the developer of the controversial Santa 
Catarina project have been heightened by the exchange of stinging letters 
between the developer and city manager, each accusing the other negotiating in 
bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
"In your letter, you allege that the city has negotiated in bad faith," City 
Manager George Caravalho wrote to Dan and Geoff Palmer of G.H. Palmer 
Associates. "This is totally inaccurate, and I find it appalling that you could 
make such a statement." 
</P>
<P>
In their letter, the Palmer brothers charged that the City Council misled 
company officials who thought city approval of the Santa Catarina project was 
virtually assured. Instead, the developers wrote, a timid City Council was 
cowed by the protests of homeowners and refused to approve the development 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the city may no longer have the political will to live by the 
results of its own planning process is certainly not a justifiable basis for 
denying the project," the Palmers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Caravalho responded that the city negotiators never guaranteed that the project 
would be approved. "A comment such as this is presumptuous and naive," 
Caravalho wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The letters, exchanged last Thursday and Friday, are the latest developments in 
the lengthy debate over the proposed Santa Catarina development in Canyon 
Country. Palmer Associates originally proposed 1,452 condominiums on 135 acres 
north of Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine Street. The council 
members said they would approve a maximum of 800 units. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Catarina project is part of a larger development agreement that would 
allow Palmer Associates to build three housing projects in return for millions 
of dollars in road improvements. Negotiations over that agreement, started a 
year ago, have reached a stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to discuss the agreement tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In their letter, the Palmer brothers offered the city two alternatives. The 
company could build 1,292 units and in return extend Golden Valley Road between 
Soledad Canyon Road and Sierra Highway. Under the second plan, the company 
would build 1,000 units but not complete Golden Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
In their letter to Caravalho, dated last Thursday, the Palmers said they would 
never have entered into negotiations with the city if they had known the city 
could recommend an economically disastrous project of 800 units. 
</P>
<P>
"The council's counter-proposal cuts project revenues by over $100 million 
while increasing estimated road construction costs by 140%," the Palmers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The developers also had harsh words for homeowners who said the project would 
inundate the neighborhood with traffic and would destroy a valuable wildlife 
habitat near the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
"The opponents' hackneyed, NIMBY criticisms were misunderstood by some members 
of the council as factually legitimate, ignoring the obvious political 
motivations behind both the criticisms and the repeated and deliberate attempts 
to confuse the council," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
In their seven-page letter, the developers portrayed themselves as victims of 
city politics. "Some council members have matched our good faith cooperation 
with a disappointing degree of what appears to us to be crowd pleasing speeches 
and political posturing," they wrote. "We are not politicians nor are we a 
charitable foundation." 
</P>
<P>
Caravalho, in his letter dated last Friday, replied that the city was not a 
foundation either, and was not "in business to make money for developers."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ASSEMBLY OKS BILL TO TAX 'TOOLS' OF GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Assembly voted 42 to 30 Monday to approve a measure that would allow 
cities and counties to impose a special tax on sales of spray paint and 
felt-tip markers -- the common tools of graffiti vandals -- to raise money for 
programs to prevent and remove graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the state Senate, cities and counties could impose a 10-cent tax 
on each can of spray paint and a 5-cent tax on marking pens. 
</P>
<P>
The income generated would be given to anti-graffiti programs, which need more 
money, said an aide to Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who sponsored the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
Before the surcharge could be imposed, it would have to be approved by 
two-thirds of the voters in a local referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 13, counties and chartered cities can use the referendum 
process to establish surcharges to support community programs. But Katz's 
legislation extends the authorization to unchartered cities for graffiti 
programs and sets up state mechanisms for collecting and distributing the 
funds, the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure has been supported by Valley Organized In Community Efforts, a San 
Fernando Valley-based coalition of churches and synagogues which argues that 
ridding the city of graffiti is a key element of efforts to curb crime and 
regain control of crime-plagued neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate effort in the city of Los Angeles, the City Council is 
considering a measure proposed by City Councilman Joel Wachs to tax all utility 
customers to raise $9.7 million for city anti-graffiti programs.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRAFFIC ACCIDENT LEADS TO VAN NUYS SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An argument over a minor traffic accident in the parking lot of a Van Nuys 
restaurant escalated into a shooting Monday that left one man injured. Police 
were searching for the suspected gunman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Kingsberry, 28, of Los Angeles was shot twice in the stomach and was 
taken to an undisclosed hospital, where he was in serious but stable condition, 
Sgt. Dallas Gibson said. An unidentified man was being sought in the 2 a.m. 
shooting that occurred in the parking lot of the 94th Aero Squadron restaurant, 
on the 16300 block of Raymer Avenue, after closing time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dispute over a traffic accident, and while they were arguing, shots 
were fired," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman immediately fled. Although several patrons were leaving the 
restaurant at the time, no one could provide police with a description of the 
suspect or his car.

BURBANK'S TREASURER, INVESTOR IN B OF A, IS CAUTIONED ON CITY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's political watchdog agency has advised Burbank's city treasurer to 
remove himself from decisions involving investment of city funds in Bank of 
America, in which he owns more than $20,000 worth of stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission recommended that City Treasurer Jim 
Rogers stay out of such investment decisions to avoid running afoul of state 
conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers asked the city attorney's office last year for legal guidance regarding 
his investments, which include more than $10,000 worth of Bank of America stock 
and a bank bond valued at more than $10,000. In December, the city attorney 
relayed the question to the FPPC. The response was recently made public. 
</P>
<P>
The city owns a $1-million certificate of deposit in Bank of America and also 
has a non-interest bearing checking account there, officials said. The city's 
overall investment portfolio is about $165 million, including redevelopment 
agency funds, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said his office plans to cash in the certificate of deposit when it 
matures in October. He said the CD was purchased by a former city treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state Political Reform Act, government officials are prohibited from 
participating in decisions that have a financial impact on any business or 
property in which they have an interest of $1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Terry B. Stevenson said Rogers has not been involved in 
investment decisions involving Bank of America since his May, 1989, election as 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter last month, FPPC attorney Jill R. Stecher also advised Rogers to 
refrain from making investment decisions involving First Interstate Bank, Chase 
Manhattan Bank and Security Pacific Bank if they would have a "material 
financial effect" on any of those institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Under FPPC rules, a decision having a material financial effect on the banks 
would be one that caused their gross revenues to increase or decrease by more 
than $1 million in one year. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers owns zero-coupon bonds at First Interstate and Security Pacific worth 
more than $1,000 apiece and another zero-coupon bond at Chase Manhattan valued 
at between $1,000 and $10,000. Zero coupon bonds pay no interest until 
maturity, similar to U.S. savings bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment agency keeps its general account at First Interstate 
and the city has purchased government securities through that bank, Rogers 
said. The city has no other investments in First Interstate, Security Pacific 
or Chase Manhattan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said he will abide by the commission's advice and will consider selling 
his personal holdings in Bank of America to eliminate possible conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my job, I like what I'm doing and I'll do what's right," he said. "I 
might not agree with it, but if I have to do it I have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, the assistant city attorney, said that although Rogers has not been 
involved in investment decisions involving Bank of America, he has used city 
money to purchase federal government-backed securities through the bank. He 
said such transactions are not investments because the bank is only acting as a 
broker for the securities. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said the conflict issue arose when Rogers asked the city attorney's 
office for an opinion on the matter after his election. 
</P>
<P>
"There was enough there that we felt more comfortable seeking an opinion from 
the FPPC," Stevenson said. "It took them awhile after that for an opinion to 
get back to us." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Flavin said the situation with Rogers' personal holdings has had no 
impact on city financial operations or investment strategy. Investment 
decisions are made collectively by Rogers, the city's finance director and an 
assistant city manager, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said he has also asked the FPPC whether his personal investments would 
prohibit him from making decisions about buying government securities through 
Bank of America. The agency has yet to render advice on that issue.

CRAMPED CUDAHY PUTS TEMPORARY HALT ON RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cudahy city officials are the first to admit that they have done almost nothing 
to prevent their town's fast-growing population from overwhelming city 
services, but last week they took their first stand against uncontrolled 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 4 to 1 to impose a temporary moratorium on residential 
construction in most of the city while officials figure out how to handle the 
burgeoning population. Councilman John Robertson voted against the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joseph Fregeau said, "Everyone I talk to has said, 'Hey, we have 
enough people in Cudahy. Let's stop and see what we've got and what we're going 
to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
The county estimates that about 21,000 residents are crammed into the 
square-mile city, making it the third-most-crowded municipality in the county. 
City officials said schools are overcrowded, streets are clogged with traffic, 
water supplies are strained and the sewer system is overtaxed. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium "is something that should have been done years ago," Fregeau 
said. "But back when it should have been done, the council had its mind on 
other business." 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium limits construction of apartments, homes and duplexes in 
multifamily residential areas, which cover about 70% of the city, Fregeau said. 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy joins a handful of cities in southeastern Los Angeles County that have 
clamped down at least temporarily on building permits in a bid to try to 
control neighborhood development. Maywood, the most crowded city in the county, 
approved building restrictions last year. Whittier and Montebello recently 
passed construction moratoriums. 
</P>
<P>
The Bell and Norwalk city councils also ordered moratoriums, but those didn't 
stick. Bell's moratorium was in effect for a year before being lifted. Norwalk 
officials on May 1 placed a 45-day moratorium on building in the downtown area, 
where small apartment buildings are replacing aging single-family residences. A 
proposal to extend the moratorium for 10 1/2 months failed. 
</P>
<P>
A moratorium is initially limited by state law to 45 days. A city council can 
extend a moratorium up to two years, but only with the approval of four-fifths 
of council members. 
</P>
<P>
During the 45-day moratorium in Cudahy, city staff members will study 
development standards and their effects on growth, Planning Director William 
Davis said. Employees will also begin updating a master plan for developing the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Fregeau said the council would like to reduce the number of residential units 
per lot, increase requirements for open space, and enlarge the industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
Most city officials agree that it is too late to try to reduce the density of 
the town. "The point is not to reduce the density of the town. The point is to 
be wiser planners for the future," Fregeau said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Like most cities in southeast Los Angeles County, Cudahy started out as the 
California version of the Midwestern farm town. When it incorporated in 1960, 
fewer than 10,000 people lived within its square-mile boundaries. The 
population increased to 16,000 by 1970, and has been growing steadily since 
then. An estimated 21,000 people now live in the city, making it the 
third-most-crowded municipality in the county, according to county planning 
officials.

sudden death to win the California Interscholastic Federation/Southern 
California Golf Assn. finals Monday at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>

four holes of regulation play, drilled a 25-foot putt for birdie on his 18th 
hole to force the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Maki birdied the 510-yard par-five first hole to win the boys' individual 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Gore, a sophomore, birdied two of the last three holes to force the playoff. 
Maki and Gore each finished with 36-hole totals of 148. Maki made an eight-foot 
putt for birdie on the first hole of sudden death to end it. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Bordwell of El Camino Real, the lone City Section player to qualify for 
the afternoon round, finished fourth individually with rounds of 77-76 -- 153. 
In the boys' competition, the low 10 players plus ties from the morning round

JONES GETS 20TH SAVE IN INDIANS' 4-3 VICTORY OVER RED SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleveland relief ace Doug Jones earned his 20th save and downplayed his role. 
</P>
<P>
That was indicative of the game Monday night as the Indians edged the Red Sox 
4-3 at Boston, on Tom Brookens' two-out single in the 12th inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the easy stuff," Jones said after he retired the Red Sox in order in the 
12th. He was the fifth Cleveland pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I think saves are overrated, especially on nights like this," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Brookens entered the game at third base in the 10th after Jesse Orosco worked 
himself out of a bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the ninth. Brooken's singled 
to left field, scoring Jerry Browne, who had singled and taken second on Mitch 
Webster's sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got out of that bases-loaded, nobody-out situation, I thought 
something was going our way, and we would win this some way, somehow," Brookens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, that was a tough one to lose, to put it mildly," Boston manager Joe 
Morgan said, noting that the Red Sox left 14 runners on base. "We had our 
chances. We had a couple of golden opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Seanez, a 21-year-old rookie reliever, earned his first major league 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Boston went ahead 3-2 on Evans' two-run single in the seventh, but the Indians 
tied the score with an unearned run in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 2-0, the Red Sox struck back after Cleveland starter Greg Swindell was 
forced to leave with a pulled left groin muscle in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Cecilio Guante replaced Swindell with the count at 2-2 on Evans. Swindell 
scattered six hits and struck out a season-high eight batters before limping 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boddicker lost a bid for a career-high seventh consecutive victory when he 
was relieved by Jeff Reardon in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Candy Maldonado greeted Reardon with a double to right, took third on an 
infield out and then scored when Cory Snyder flied to short right, and catcher 
Pena dropped Tom Brunansky's throw for an error. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the bottom of the seventh, Jody Reed and Ellis Burks singled 
and moved up a base on Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar's passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Brunansky was walked intentionally and Evans followed with his two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 4, Toronto 1 -- Bill Krueger pitched 5 1/3 hitless innings in a rare 
start as the Brewers broke a five-game losing streak at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Krueger (3-3) allowed two hits, walked one and struck out five in eight innings 
against a Toronto team that had scored 31 runs in the first three games. Dan 
Plesac pitched the ninth, allowing one hit, to collect his 11th save while 
ending the Blue Jays' winning streak at four games. 
</P>
<P>
Krueger, a reliever making his first start since last June 24, gave up a 
one-out single to Mookie Wilson in the sixth. Wilson scored on a two-out single 
by Tony Fernandez to end the shutout bid. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers scored four runs in the fourth, driving out Toronto starter Willie 
Blair (0-3). B.J. Surhoff singled, reached third on two wild pitches and scored 
on Greg Brock's double. Greg Vaughn followed with an RBI double and went to 
third on an infield out. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Molitor walked and worked a double steal with Vaughn as Toronto second 
baseman Manny Lee had trouble getting the ball out of his glove after taking 
the throw. Gary Sheffield's double scored Molitor, making it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Seattle 1 -- Melido Perez pitched seven shutout innings and Carlton 
Fisk hit the 341st homer of his career as the White Sox beat Mariners at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
It was the surprising second-place White Sox's fourth straight win and moved 
them to within two games of the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners, who committed three errors and surrendered two unearned runs, 
dropped to 11-18 in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
Perez (6-4) improved his lifetime record to 4-0 against the Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk gave the White Sox a 1-0 lead when he led off the second inning with his 
fifth home run off Matt Young (1-7). It was Young's fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago added an unearned run in the second after Carlos Martinez and Scott 
Fletcher followed Fisk's homer with singles, with Martinez going to second. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox loaded the bases when Ozzie Guillen hit a grounder that shortstop 
Brian Giles couldn't handle. Sammy Sosa hit a grounder to third baseman Edgar 
Martinez, who threw home but couldn't get Carlos Martinez at the plate.

GREAT AMERICAN PONDERS SALE OF BRANCHES IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great American Bank, the troubled San Diego-based savings and loan, is 
considering selling many of its California branches to an outside bidder, 
sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift would then take the proceeds and try to survive as an independent 
institution with its remaining branches and assets in California, Arizona and 
Washington state, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
If completed, such a sale could be one of the first partial sales of a 
still-solvent but failing S&amp;L under a new approach by the Office of Thrift 
Supervision. Under this approach, the thrift regulatory agency would assist an 
institution in liquidating assets to raise capital before its value is 
decreased by a regulatory takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Although declining to comment on Great American, OTS spokesman Bill Fulwider 
said his office generally is considering new ways of resolving a problem 
institution before it actually gets taken over and placed within the federal 
Resolution Trust Corp. for liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to try to avoid the problem that has been encountered whereby 
institutions go into RTC, are not sold right away and lose value, substantial 
value," Fulwider said. "So what we are looking at would be less expensive to 
the taxpayer if we could resolve a situation early." 
</P>
<P>
Banks said to be considering bids for Great American branches and assets 
include Bank of America, Security Pacific, Wells Fargo, Chase Manhattan and 
Citicorp. According to Brea-based banking analyst Gerry Findley, banks are 
"scurrying around the S&amp;L garbage" looking for cheap funding sources, 
particularly branch-generated deposits because the institution can pay lower 
interest on them than deposits solicited from outside a branch's service area. 
</P>
<P>
Great American is still solvent, but there are widespread doubts in the 
industry that it can remain so unless an outside buyer or investor is found 
soon. Chairman and Chief Executive Gordon C. Luce has announced that he will 
retire later this year after a successor has been hired. James Cirona, 
president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, was offered the job, 
but he and the S&amp;L board could not agree to terms. 
</P>
<P>
Great American, the nation's eighth-largest S&amp;L with $15.4 billion in 
assets, has been fighting for its life since last December, when steep losses 
in its Arizona loan portfolio severely depleted its capital. Regulators have 
told Great American that it has until Dec. 31 to come into line with minimum 
capital requirements or face a government seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Recent losses have reduced Great American's so-called tangible capital -- one 
measure of its financial cushion against losses -- to $129 million, about half 
the amount regulators require of an S&amp;L its size. The S&amp;L nearly broke 
even for its first quarter, reporting a $1.2-million loss, but disclosed that 
it is involved in a dispute with regulators over asset valuations that could 
result in write-downs of $65 million for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the capital standards, Great American must find a buyer for all or part 
of its assets, restructure or bring in $350 million in outside capital. Sources 
said potential buyers have shied away from making offers for all of Great 
American because of lingering fears that the S&amp;L has not yet reached bottom 
with its problem loans in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
But scenarios now being discussed by possible bidders involve an outsider 
buying only part of Great American's highly prized branch network while 
distancing itself from exposure to the devastated Arizona real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Under one scenario being discussed, a bidder would buy about half of Great 
American's California branches and core deposits, paying up to $150 million, or 
about 3% of the total core deposits -- those generated by the branches to be 
acquired. In addition, the bidder would loan Great American funds that would be 
convertible to stock if and when Great American solves its Arizona problems and 
regains its financial strength. 
</P>
<P>
With the money from the branch sale and the loan, Great American would buy time 
and gain a fighting chance of surviving in some form, sources said.

SMALL FIRMS GET HELP IN SELLING GOODS ABROAD

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of peddling soft drinks, laundry detergent and other consumer goods 
for major corporations, Bob Wallace decided two years ago to take his 
experience and strike out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a few thousand dollars and years of marketing savvy, the former Los 
Angeles marketing manager for Pepsico Inc. and Lever Bros. started an export 
management company to help others do what he does best: sell in the 
international market. 
</P>
<P>
His goal is simple: "I'm giving the little Davids of this world a shot at the 
world market," Wallace said. "I'm the scout sent out to reconnoiter for the 
advancing troops." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, marketing director of Exports International Co. in Santa Ana, is among 
a growing pool of former international marketing managers who have left large 
corporations to work as export consultants for small and medium-size companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Most export managers have previous corporate experience and have an 
entrepreneurial spirit," said Edward Chavez, president of Anaheim Marketing 
International, an export management firm in Anaheim. "And export management is 
one area that allows them to use this entrepreneurial characteristic to exploit 
their marketing abilities and knowledge of the international market." 
</P>
<P>
Demand for export assistance has increased as more small and medium-size 
companies -- many with no prior experience in foreign markets -- try to peddle 
their wares abroad, said Martin Magdaleno, president of Sel Pro International, 
an Anaheim export management firm. Also, many companies can't afford to hire a 
full-time international marketing manager, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, the local manufacturers have a great product but they don't 
export because they don't want to be bothered with the extra paper work and 
bureaucracy," said Magdaleno, a former manager of Beckman Instruments 
international division. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many U.S. companies are reluctant to take the time and effort to 
understand a foreign nation's culture and trade practices -- often a key to 
success abroad. And companies that are doing brisk business in the U.S. market 
are sometimes reluctant to spend money on a possibly risky overseas marketing 
program, said Patrick Killeen, marketing vice president for PEC International 
Trading Co. in San Marcos.

Troops and police scuffled with demonstrators outside the Romanian government 
headquarters in Bucharest, witnesses said. The government moved in hundreds of 
troops and military police and several armored personnel carriers to protect 
the huge building on Victory Square as about 500 protesters and onlookers 
milled outside. Tempers flared when supporters of pro-democracy hunger strikers 
marched to the doors of the building, where the strikers were meeting with 
government negotiators.

Federal agents took 60 illegal Chinese aliens into custody in southern Alabama 
and announced the arrest of the alleged ringleader of a smuggling operation 
that planned to bring 35,000 more into the United States. Officials from the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs Service said the 
aliens were caught as they arrived by plane from Panama in Fairhope, Ala. The 
ring planned to bring in Chinese nationals from Panama and Bolivia in an 
operation believed to be run by persons linked to former Panamanian dictator 
Manuel A. Noriega.

FIRST PERSON: PREGNANCY: MAN'S FINAL FRONTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, Mike Clary, a free-lance writer in Miami, is the author of 
Daddy's Home (Pickering Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Father's Day, as we dads prepare to open our gifts of after-shave and 
barbecue aprons, it's time to face up to the only challenge left for a real man 
in the 1990s. Forget taming the West, conquering space or climbing Mt. Everest 
in shorts and sandals. For men, pregnancy is the last frontier, and it's just a 
question now of who's going first. 
</P>
<P>
How do I know? Television. Already this year two popular prime-time programs 
have dealt with the issue. On "Alien Nation," the otherworldly George 
Francisco, uncomfortably swollen and feeling sorry for himself, wails to his 
detective partner: "I shouldn't expect you to sympathize. You don't have to get 
up five times a night to urinate. You have no understanding of what I'm going 
through." 
</P>
<P>
On "The Cosby Show," several men find themselves dreaming of being pregnant. 
But instead of having a baby, they give birth to one of their fondest desires. 
Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable (Bill Cosby) has a submarine sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the notion of a man with a baby in his belly is played for laughs. But 
television is our most potent purveyor of new ideas; there's some serious 
groundbreaking going on here, too. "Alien Nation" executive producer Kenneth 
Johnson has confessed to having a bad case of "uterine envy" and he says he 
would leap at the chance to give birth. The "Alien Nation" pregnancy episode, 
he says, was designed to confront stereotypes of men's and women's roles, and 
break them down. And where TV leads, real life usually follows. 
</P>
<P>
But before we get around to nominating candidates, let's deal with a couple of 
pregnant questions looming over this androgynous new world: how and why. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively speaking, how is the easy part. According to doctors who have 
theorized about men as mothers, a fertilized egg could be surgically implanted 
in the lining of a man's abdominal cavity, and with infusions of female 
hormones, the embryo would form its own placenta and grow. The baby would be 
delivered by Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
But why? Any man who has accompanied a partner through pregnancy and childbirth 
knows what hard, painful, messy work we're talking about here. And besides, 
women do it now, naturally and well. So what's the point of overriding Mother 
Nature? To be first? For adventure? Because, as the climber said of the 
mountain, it's there? 
</P>
<P>
Or is it there? Abdominal pregnancies do happen sometimes in women, and they 
are dangerous, often presenting life-threatening complications. That doesn't 
mean that there aren't men willing to take the risks. In fact, the risks 
guarantee a ready supply of willing men. 
</P>
<P>
Now, who's first? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I'd volunteer myself, but I've done some pioneering already as a 
househusband, and in fact I'm still at home. Weekdays I work as a writer until 
the children, Annie, now 12, and Joey, 8, come from school, and after that I'm 
pretty busy running a shuttle service to baseball and karate practice and 
figuring out what to microwave for dinner. Honestly, I don't have the time for 
a baby right now. Besides, at 47 I'm a little past childbearing age, and a 
couple of weeks ago I pulled a muscle in my back playing basketball at the Y 
and it's still bothering me. 
</P>
<P>
No, the candidate we're looking for is a much younger person. In fact, since 
the medical technology is not quite worked out, and since, to my knowledge, 
other opinion molders such as "thirtysomething" and "Murphy Brown" have yet to 
weigh in on male pregnancy, we are probably a few years away from sending a man 
into deep labor. Maybe even 20 years away. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that a fellow about 30 years old would be the right age to go first, 
the person we're looking for is now a lad of about 10, or even 8 or 9, from a 
family headed by parents unafraid to break with tradition, willing to start 
preparing now to give their male child a place in history that will make Neil 
Armstrong and Lewis and Clark seem like timid stay-at-homes. 
</P>
<P>
Who? My son Joey? 
</P>
<P>
Well, no, Joey will be committed to a career in the National Basketball Assn. 
by then. Or come to think of it, he might even be off exploring the remote 
reaches of the Antarctic, in a climate totally unsuited to the raising of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, let's forget the whole thing. The truth is, I just can't imagine how 
pregnancy for men would work, or whoever thought it was a good idea in the 
first place. Because I sure don't have the stomach for it. And neither, I hope, 
does my son.

FAMILY-STYLE BENEFIT HELPS A FAMILY ISSUE

Mary Lou Retton taught Roger Rabbit how to jump on the balance beam, Ronald 
Reagan tossed a football through a tire and Debbie Allen spun the Wheel of 
Fortune while Cathy Guisewite worked her way through a ream of paper drawing 
"Cathy" cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
As one guest put it, "This is so much better than the chicken dish thing that 
we're all so used to." 
</P>
<P>
There was no chicken dish thing in sight when Ted and Susie Field opened the 
back yard of their Beverly Hills Greenacres mansion for a Sunday afternoon 
benefit for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Under a huge white tent guests and 
their families roamed among carnival booths staffed by celebrities who looked 
happy to be there. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was because they could come in their scruffiest clothes. Major 
entertainment industry execs wore shorts revealing skinned knees, actresses had 
no makeup on and everyone seemed relieved at not having to wear black-tie. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything do with AIDS I want to be involved with," said singer Elton John 
minutes before he was to man the Super Strike booth. "I'll keep going until a 
cure is found. I was supposed to be back in England today, but how could I miss 
this? If you turn this sort of thing down, there's not much worth going home 
for." 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone is having a good time," said Elizabeth Glaser, co-founder 
(along with Susan De Laurentis and Susan Zeegen), of the Pediatric AIDS 
Foundation. "It's great for me to see people getting to see friends they 
haven't seen for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Glaser started the foundation in 1988 to fund pediatric AIDS research as well 
as educate the public and provide emergency assistance to hospitals around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Pediatric AIDS is now a family issue," she said. "Because if the child is 
infected, usually the mother is infected, and the father, too. We wanted to 
have an event that was for the whole family." 
</P>
<P>
At this party the celebs had donned neon-bright caps that read "Hero" to run 
booths such as Super Hero Bean Bag Toss, Blast Off, Fish Pond and Quarterback 
Scramble. 
</P>
<P>
There were Paula Abdul, Fred Savage, Martin Short, Sugar Ray Leonard, Mel 
Harris, Sandy Koufax, Amy Irving, Cybill Shepherd, Robin Leach, Joe Namath, 
Dana Delany, Norm Nixon, Mariel Hemingway, Billy Crystal, Bart Connor, Michael 
Keaton, Ted Danson, Keanu Reeves, Henry Winkler, Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis, 
Ali McGraw, Nadia Comaneci, Jamaal Wilkes, NBC entertainment chief Brandon and 
Lilly Tartikoff and Nancy and Ronald Reagan -- and children, where applicable. 
</P>
<P>
The Fields underwrote the party, which raised $900,000 for the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Added Elizabeth Glaser, "People can't be complacent because we haven't won the 
war yet."

PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURE TO VOTE ON QUEBEC PACT; 
</P>
<P>
CANADA: THE NEWFOUNDLAND LAWMAKERS WILL CONSIDER RATIFICATION OF AN ACCORD 
GIVING SPECIAL POWERS TO THE NATION'S FRENCH-SPEAKING PROVINCE.

<P>
Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said Monday that he will put a controversial 
package of constitutional amendments to a vote in the provincial legislature 
sometime in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Newfoundland legislators will vote on whether to ratify amendments, coupled 
with a political accord hammered out last week, that give special powers to the 
French-speaking province of Quebec. The possibility of amending the 
constitution in this way has touched off a bitter debate all across Canada. 
Seven of the country's 10 provinces have already ratified the amendments; three 
have been holding out. Newfoundland has fought the changes more vigorously than 
any other province. 
</P>
<P>
A "yes" vote by Newfoundland now would do much to break years of constitutional 
impasse in Canada, where Quebec has refused to sign the national constitution 
since 1982. A "no" vote would almost certainly kill the amendments, inflame 
separatist sentiments in Quebec and torpedo all chance of further 
constitutional amendment in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, speaking first in the legislature and later in a news conference in the 
provincial capital of St. John's, declined to set a date for the vote. He said 
he wants to give the legislators plenty of time to consult with their 
constituents beforehand. He noted that the vote could be held as late as June 
22, just one day before the amendments must be ratified by all 10 provinces or 
become null. 
</P>
<P>
Putting off the vote until the last possible moment adds to the cliff-hanger 
atmosphere that has prevailed in Canada for the last few weeks, as Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney has fought a fierce battle to persuade all 10 provinces 
to ratify the amendments before they expire. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney's efforts culminated last week in seven days of closed-door marathon 
bargaining sessions, in which the 10 premiers struggled to find common ground 
between the pro-amendment and anti-amendment camps. (In addition to 
Newfoundland, the provinces of New Brunswick and Manitoba had refused to sign 
the amendment package, called the Meech Lake Accord.) By Saturday, the 
exhausted premiers said they were as close to having an agreement as they would 
ever be. 
</P>
<P>
But while Wells' call for a legislative vote may prolong Canada's agony, it 
does appear as the lesser of two evils in the eyes of some observers. Until 
Monday, Wells had been saying he wanted to put the amendments to a popular 
referendum, province-wide. In such an event, impoverished, isolated "Newfies," 
as other Canadians deprecatingly call the people of Newfoundland, would have 
had the chance to vent years of ire toward with Quebec by voting the amendments 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision taken by Mr. Wells today is a very good one," said Gil Remillard, 
Quebec's provincial minister of inter-governmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In his news conference, Wells said he would still have preferred to hold a 
referendum, but he said that Quebec and other provinces weren't willing to 
extend the June 23 deadline and give him the time that a referendum would 
require. He said he hadn't wavered from his position that the Meech Lake Accord 
is a bad proposition for Canada, but he added that he isn't absolutely positive 
about this. As long as he harbored any doubts, he said, he felt obligated to 
let his fellow Newfoundlanders have their say. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said he wouldn't do anything to influence the outcome of the vote. And he 
invited Mulroney and the nine other provincial premiers to come to Newfoundland 
and explain publicly why they want the public to vote in favor of the 
pro-Quebec amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legislatures of Manitoba and New Brunswick must still ratify the 
Meech Lake Accord. New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna has said that he now 
accepts the package and that he will push it through his provincial legislature 
in good time. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Manitoba is more precarious, however. There, the legislature 
isn't even in session now. The law calls for full public hearings to be held 
before ratification. And while Premier Gary Filmon now says he thinks the 
constitutional documents are "worth supporting," he has also been making 
charges that the federal government has been monitoring his private, Meech 
Lake-related phone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Three provinces that have not yet done so must ratify Canada's so-called Meech 
Lake Accord for it to become effective. And they must do so by June 23 -- a 
week from Saturday. Otherwise, the accord becomes null. Attention is focused on 
the legislature of Newfoundland, whose premier most stubbornly resisted signing 
the accord after last week's talks in Ottawa. But the legislatures of Manitoba 
and New Brunswick must also vote their approval. The aim of the accord is to 
bring French-speaking Quebec, where separatist sentiment is great, under 
Canada's 1982 constitution.

KURDS LAUNCH BIGGEST RAID IN TURKEY SINCE '88

Rebel Kurds launched their most deadly attack in two years Sunday night, 
killing at least 20 civilians in a remote village in southeastern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The Anatolian News Agency said Monday that at least 20 civilians were killed, 
and sources in the regional city of Diyarbakir said the toll could reach 26. 
</P>
<P>
The raid on Cevrimli village, 30 miles north of the Iraqi and Syrian borders, 
showed that the Marxist Kurdish Workers Party is still a potent force despite 
renewed government efforts to stamp out a six-year insurgency. It was the 
rebels' biggest operation since 25 villagers were killed in nearby Mardin 
province in May, 1988.

REUNIFICATION: THE FOREIGN MINISTERS MOVE CLOSER TO RESOLVING DIFFERENCES OVER 
THE STATUS OF A FUTURE GERMANY.

<P>
Against a backdrop heavy with history, West German and Soviet foreign ministers 
met for six hours in this border city Monday and declared that they have moved 
closer to resolving key differences on the status of a future united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Although Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and his West German 
counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, repeatedly declined to offer details of 
the talks, they indicated that progress had been achieved both on the question 
of a united Germany's membership in the NATO alliance and the larger question 
of relations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the 
Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"Progress is there," Shevardnadze declared. "This is extremely difficult 
diplomatic work." 
</P>
<P>
Both Germanys and three of the four victorious World War II allies -- the 
United States, Britain and France -- want a united Germany that is a fully 
integrated member of NATO. The Soviet Union, under considerable domestic 
pressure, has consistently resisted such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Brest, on the Polish border, was the scene of heavy fighting 
between Nazi and Soviet forces in World War II, in which Shevardnadze's brother 
was killed. It is also where the Germans and the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty 
of Brest-Litovsk in 1918 ending Moscow's role in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
The location for the talks was reportedly chosen by Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
While differences clearly remained in this -- the third meeting in just over 
two weeks between the two foreign ministers -- a conspicuously conciliatory 
atmosphere bred optimism among both Soviet and West German officials that 
still-divisive issues surrounding German unity can be resolved soon. 
</P>
<P>
The two agreed to meet again next week, before the June 22 meeting in East 
Berlin of foreign ministers from both Germanys and the four victorious Allied 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher said his Soviet counterpart indicated a strong willingness during 
Monday's talks to reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised that he himself pointed to the necessity of getting through 
the negotiations," Genscher told reporters aboard his return flight to Bonn. 
"He really wants that." 
</P>
<P>
West German officials noted that Shevardnadze had apparently dropped the idea 
of letting internal German unity proceed quickly while negotiations on external 
aspects of unity, such as alliance membership, move more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the change of atmospherics was similar to that at the recent 
U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington, where two former adversaries seemed to be 
searching for a common way forward. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a demonstration of our will to finally draw a line under the last war 
and begin a new chapter of our relations," Shevardnadze told a news conference 
after the talks. 
</P>
<P>
In a moving, personal gesture ostensibly aimed at underscoring this point, 
Shevardnadze and Genscher visited a Soviet war memorial and cemetery just west 
of the city where Shevardnadze's brother and thousands of other Soviet soldiers 
are buried amid the ruins of a 19th-Century fortress. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher laid wreaths at an eternal flame and at the headstone of 21-year-old 
Sgt. Akaki Shevardnadze, who died in heavy fighting during the first hours of 
the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in June, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Shevardnadze is one of 830 Soviet soldiers buried adjacent to the flame 
along three black polished granite walls listing the names of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
Those Soviets who defended the Brest fortress were among the first of about 27 
million of their compatriots to die in World War II, by far the largest number 
of casualties suffered by any nation during the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The lingering trauma of that experience has loaded the German-Soviet 
relationship with excessive emotional and political baggage ever since. 
</P>
<P>
After laying the wreath, Genscher and Shevardnadze together placed individual 
carnations atop some of the graves. 
</P>
<P>
The location of Brest, since 1939 a Soviet border town on the Bug River, 
carries other dimensions in Soviet-German history. Brest-Litovsk, as Brest was 
known until 1940, was also where the Bolshevik Leon Trotsky negotiated a 
separate peace with Germany in March, 1918, ending Russian participation in 
World War I. The pact's terms forced Russia to accept the independence of the 
Ukraine, Georgia and Finland and cede all or parts of Poland, the Baltic 
republics and Byelorussia to Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

EAST GERMANY'S LEADER MAKES A SYMBOLIC VISIT

Lothar de Maiziere, the first and almost certainly the last East German prime 
minister to visit the White House, met Monday with President Bush and, in a 
symbolic effort to reassure American Jews, presented the keystone of what was 
once the largest synagogue in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The gift will be placed in the U.S. Holocaust Museum planned for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere's visit, which continues today in meetings with congressional 
leaders, is almost entirely symbolic because he and the government he heads 
have relatively little power. Most decisions about Germany's future are being 
made by the leaders of West Germany, particularly Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials wanted to send a message to East German citizens 
that their interests are being considered as Germany unifies. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also wanted to underscore Bush's argument that the leaders 
of both Germanys favor continued German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, something the Soviet Union has resisted. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, for his part, wanted to make a gesture to American Jews, 
demonstrating that his government, unlike East Germany's former Communist 
regimes, accepts a shared responsibility for the Nazi Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
On all of those counts, the visit appears to have been successful. 
</P>
<P>
At the offices of the Holocaust Memorial Council, which is building the new 
Holocaust Museum, De Maiziere spoke of East Germany's new effort to "face up to 
our own history in its totality." 
</P>
<P>
And at the White House, officials said De Maiziere agreed with Bush on what the 
Administration considers the central issue in the debate over German 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
The two agreed that a united Germany "should enjoy full sovereignty from the 
time of its unification, with no discriminatory constraints on its sovereignty, 
and that Germany should be free to choose its own alliance arrangements," the 
White House said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met with De Maiziere for about 30 minutes in the White House Cabinet room, 
then joined him for lunch. Afterwards, De Maiziere toured Washington before 
visiting the downtown office building where the Holocaust Memorial Council has 
its temporary quarters. 
</P>
<P>
There, in a brief ceremony, he turned over to council officials two large 
bricks, one from the original Oraniengburgerstrasse synagogue, the other from 
the current reconstruction of the building. 
</P>
<P>
The synagogue, which was the crown of Berlin's thriving Jewish community before 
the Holocaust, was the largest in Europe when built in 1866. It was destroyed 
on Nov. 9, 1938, during Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, when Nazi 
mobs burned and pillaged synagogues and Jewish businesses throughout Germany.

...AND HALF A WORLD AWAY, A JAPANESE TOWN HAILS AN ADOPTED SON'S VICTORY

News of Alberto Fujimori's victory in Peru's presidential election brought 
people into the streets to celebrate half a world away in Kawachi, the small 
Japanese town where his father was born. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also 
welcomed the news. 
</P>
<P>
But a Japanese government spokesman ruled out any special economic aid for the 
hugely indebted South American country just because its new leader is of 
Japanese descent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our government does not take special measures on the grounds that a Japanese 
descendant has won (an election)," Nobuo Ishihara told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
There was no such reserve in Kawachi, in the Kumamoto region of southern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of townspeople gathered at the town hall early in the morning to 
celebrate Mr. Fujimori's victory," said Shunji Shimazu, mayor of the town that 
Fujimori's father, Naoichi, a tailor, left in 1934 to seek his fortune in 
faraway Peru. 
</P>
<P>
"They broke open a sake barrel and toasted the new president to cries of 
'Banzai!' The whole township is now obsessed by the news of Fujimori," the 
mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Shimazu said he immediately sent Fujimori a congratulatory message and put up 
banners at the town hall reading, "Congratulations, President Alberto 
Fujimori." 
</P>
<P>
A Peruvian flag and Japan's rising sun flew together outside, he added. A 
street is to be renamed Fujimori Avenue.

GOVERNMENT SHIELDED FROM OWN BAD ADVICE;

LAW: THE HIGH COURT RULES THAT U.S. MAY NOT BE SUED EVEN IF CITIZENS SUFFER

<P>
A citizen who loses government benefits because of bad advice from a government 
official cannot sue the government to get the money back, the Supreme Court 
ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-2 decision was issued in the case of a retired Navy welder from San Diego 
who was told -- orally and in writing -- that he could earn extra money for one 
year and keep his disability pension. 
</P>
<P>
The advice was wrong. Congress had changed the law and earning the extra money 
made the welder ineligible for the disability pay for a time. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the justices ruled that the government acted correctly in cutting 
off his benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling appears to insulate the government from any liability for bad advice 
given by Social Security officials or agents of the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the high court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy in a 19-page opinion 
seemed to indicate that it is more important to uphold the law than to do 
justice in an individual case. The Constitution says that money may not be 
spent except by law, and the welder in this case was not eligible under law for 
the continued benefits, the court reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, it has been difficult to win suits if a low-level official 
misleads a taxpayer or a Social Security recipient. Now, it will be nearly 
impossible to win such a case, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought this was an egregious case," said Neal S. Dudovitz, a lawyer for 
the National Senior Citizens Law Center in Los Angeles. "He didn't just rely on 
advice over the phone. He was told in writing that this was the law." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Richmond, a Vietnam veteran, was a civilian welder for the Navy in San 
Diego when he developed job-related vision problems and was forced to retire in 
1981. Because his vision prevented him from welding, he was eligible for a 
disability pension. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law in 1981, he could earn up to 80% of his former annual Navy wages 
for two years in a row and still keep his disability pay. But Congress 
tightened the law in 1982 to cut off disability benefits if a recipient earned 
more than 80% of his old pay in any year. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond drove a school bus part time and earned about $13,000. When he saw a 
chance to do extra work, he inquired of Navy personnel officials whether 
earning more would affect his disability pension. No, he was assured, so long 
as he did not earn more than 80% of his old pay for two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
But when Richmond earned $19,936 in 1986, which was $920 over the 80% limit, he 
received a letter from the government telling him that his disability pay had 
been cut off. 
</P>
<P>
"He was outraged," said Ron Sievers, a Long Beach attorney who worked on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of reversals before government appeal boards, a federal appeals 
court in Washington ruled for Richmond in 1988. It said that the Navy had so 
grossly mistreated Richmond that it should be required to repay him the $3,993 
in benefits he lost. 
</P>
<P>
But the Justice Department appealed the case to the Supreme Court, arguing that 
the ruling in his favor could open the door to thousands of claimants who lost 
money because of bad advice by government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Starr, U.S. solicitor general, told the justices in the February 
argument that the Navy's advice was "very unfortunate for Mr. Richmond," but 
the dispute nonetheless involved "a run-of-the-mill error" by federal 
employees. The U.S. Treasury should not be forced to pay for such errors, he 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
The justices agreed Monday. "To open the door to (such) claims would only 
invite endless litigation over both real and imagined claims by disgruntled 
citizens, imposing an unpredictable drain on the public (treasury)," Kennedy 
wrote in the case (Office of Personnel Management vs. Richmond, 88-1943). 
</P>
<P>
"Even if most claims were rejected in the end, the burden of defending such 
claims would itself be substantial," Kennedy added. 
</P>
<P>
His opinion noted, however, that Richmond could go to Congress and asked that 
the law be changed to rectify the mistake. Lawyers for Richmond said he did not 
want to comment on the ruling Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dissenting were Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr., who said 
that the government "should bear the burden of the government's error." 
</P>
<P>
In another action, the high court let stand a ruling that barred the city of 
Burlington, Vt., from placing a Jewish religious symbol in a park in front of 
city hall during the Christmas season. The court, without comment, refused to 
hear the case (City of Burlington vs. Mark A. Kaplan, 89-1625) brought by the 
city seeking review of a ruling by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from permits the city issued to a Jewish group to place a 
16-foot-high menorah, a nine-pronged candelabra associated with Hanukkah, in 
City Hall Park for a week in December in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in recent years has banned such practices.

FLAG DECISION SETS OFF SCRAMBLE IN CONGRESS;

<P>
Spurred by a Supreme Court ruling, key members of Congress Monday demanded 
swift passage of a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, while 
outnumbered opponents scrambled to line up votes to block it. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of an amendment are helped by several factors. Congress' top two 
Republican leaders -- Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Rep. Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) 
-- are leading the charge, with President Bush's enthusiastic backing. They 
also have strong support from two key Democrats -- the chairmen of the Senate 
and House Judiciary committees: Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-R. I.) and Rep. 
Jack Brooks (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, key votes will take place in the patriotic atmosphere surrounding 
Flag Day, which falls on Thursday, and the Fourth of July, less than three 
weeks later. And in the charged politics of an election year, lawmakers will be 
wary of casting votes on emotional issues that might inspire negative TV ads by 
their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"People who vote (against the amendment) will have to go home and explain," 
said Dole, the Senate minority leader. "It will make a good 30-second spot." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, opponents of the flag-burning amendment appear to have several 
things going for them, too. Opinion polls indicate that the issue has lost 
steam in recent months and that it is insufficient to decide an election by 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also have a statistical advantage: A constitutional amendment can be 
blocked by a one-third minority in either house of Congress. And Congress' top 
two Democrats -- House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) -- have vowed to fight it vigorously, with 
the expected help of several prominent Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now within 10 or 15 votes of stopping it," said Rep. Don Edwards (D-San 
Jose), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights. "But it's awful tough. There's a mindless stampede out there, and, if 
it passes, the President will sign it and the states will step all over 
themselves to ratify it." 
</P>
<P>
Dole pressed for quick approval of the amendment on Flag Day, but he was 
rebuffed by Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a grievous error in the haste and heat of controversy to amend the 
Bill of Rights," Mitchell said, adding later that there will be "ample 
opportunity to discuss this issue in the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Brooks announced that his Judiciary Committee will act on a 
proposed amendment next Tuesday and will bring it to the House floor before 
July 4. 
</P>
<P>
"The flag is too important a symbol of our nationhood and all that we have 
struggled for over the past two centuries to leave it unprotected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By overwhelming margins, the Senate and the House voted last fall to pass the 
Flag Protection Act, which was ruled unconstitutional by the high court Monday. 
Shortly after passing the statute, the Senate voted, 51 to 48, in favor of a 
constitutional amendment -- 15 votes short of the required two-thirds majority. 
There has been no vote in the House on an amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Political operatives were cautious about gauging the impact of the issue on 
this year's elections. But strategists in both parties agreed that much of the 
initial public indignation that followed last year's court decision on the 
matter has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody is going to win or lose an election on this," said 
political consultant Lyn Nofziger, a one-time aide to former President Ronald 
Reagan. "The issue has been petering out . . . . It's not like there is a lot 
of flag-burning going on to keep it alive." 
</P>
<P>
"Whether this is an issue that people are going to win or lose elections on, I 
can't say," said Ed Rollins, a chief Republican strategist for House races. 
"But I do think it's an issue that defines values. I think it's an issue that 
Republicans can push and Democrats will run from." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic pollster Ed Lazarus said that "it's not a big motivating issue in 
terms of how people vote. I don't anticipate that it will be a huge problem for 
Democrats," should they oppose a constitutional ban on flag burning. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly concerned about the issue, Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown tried 
to set up a rhetorical shield for his party's candidates in a statement that 
cited his own record as a veteran of military service. 
</P>
<P>
"To drag the flag through cheap politics is every bit as offensive as burning 
it," Brown said.

Angus McBean, whose photographs of British entertainers ranged from a young

David Ball, his assistant, said McBean had taken ill in February at his winter 
home in Marrakech, Morocco. "He had assignments there for Harper's &amp; Queen 
and Vogue. Despite his age, he was very much in demand." 
</P>
<P>
From the early 1930s to the mid-1960s, McBean's portraits graced nearly every 
theater in England. When he gave up stage photography in 1963 he noted "I had 
photographed all of Shakespeare's plays in major productions: 'Hamlet' 14 times 
and 'Macbeth' 16 times." 
</P>
<P>
He became the official photographer for the Old Vic, Sadler's Wells and the 
Shakespeare Memorial Theater at Stratford-on-Avon. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first young actors to attract his attention was Olivier, whom he 
found in a stage corner during a rehearsal at the Old Vic. Other stage legends 
he photographed included Ralph Richardson, Ivor Novello and Vivien Leigh. As 
his reputation grew, many of England's most accomplished performers refused to 
be photographed by anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, McBean photographed Leigh. It was his portrait of her 
that was sent to Hollywood for studio talent scouts looking for an actress to 
play Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
McBean saw Audrey Hepburn in a chorus line and after he used her in a beauty 
advertisement she was invited to Hollywood. He took the picture of the Beatles 
leaning over a stair rail for the 1963 cover of their "Please Please Me" album. 
</P>
<P>
McBean, a cheerful, bearded man, whose surrealistic Christmas cards were 
eagerly awaited each year by his friends, began by emulating the avant-garde 
artists of the 1930s with photographs showing actresses in extraordinary poses. 
Flora Robson, for instance, was shown as a classical bust in a desert. 
</P>
<P>
Collecting photographs was such an unappreciated pursuit that in 1974, when 
McBean wanted to divest himself of his glass-plate negatives, no British 
institution was interested. So he sold 4.5 tons of them, covering 700 stage 
productions over 30 years, to the Harvard Theater Collection. 
</P>
<P>
McBean was born in Newport, Wales, and discovered his gift with the camera at 
age 12. 
</P>
<P>
He got his break as a photographer when he was discovered by Novello, the 
actor, dramatist and composer, while working as a maker of stage masks and 
props. 
</P>
<P>
McBean maintained that "anyone can be a photographer. It is the subject matter 
which makes a great photographer."

CHANNEL 13 HIRES HERNANDEZ; JACOBS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Channel 13 has hired Channel 2 sportscaster Tony Hernandez, news director Jeff 
Wald said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Vic (the Brick) Jacobs' Channel 13 contract, which expires at the end of the 
month, will not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs has been at the station since the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez will remain at Channel 2 until June 30, and begin at Channel 13 July 
2. Jacobs, who came to Channel 13 from Fresno, is expected to remain at the 
station until Hernandez takes over. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, reached in Portland, Ore., where he is covering the NBA finals, said 
he was notified through his agent, Burt Shapiro, a month ago that Channel 2 was 
terminating his contract. 
</P>
<P>
"My contract actually runs through 1991, but my cycle was up," he said. "What 
they offered was a new one-year contract at a 25% salary cut. 
</P>
<P>
"What I regret is that all this was done through my agent. Neither Mr. Hyland 
(general manager Bob) nor (news director) Michael Singer ever spoke to me 
personally. I wish someone had been conscientious enough to have called me in." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said sports director Keith Olbermann knew that his contract had been 
terminated. "I got the impression Keith wanted me to stay," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was at Channel 7 for 5 1/2 years and was at Channel 2 for nearly 6 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said what appealed to him about the Channel 13 offer was a 
Monday-through-Friday schedule, the fact that he would be No. 1 at Channel 13, 
and that Channel 13 gave him a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be the sports director," Hernandez said. "In my 12 years here, I have 
never been the No. 1 person at a Los Angeles station, and I'm excited about 
that."

PORTLAND, AFTER FLOP, TRIES TO COME BACK; 
</P>
<P>
GAME 4: UP RIGHT AND ALL RIGHT, DETROIT'S LAIMBEER IS STANDING IN THE TRAIL 
BLAZERS' WAY AS THE PISTONS GO FOR TWO IN A ROW IN OREGON. 
</P>

<P>
In Game 3's diving competition, Bill Laimbeer's flops worked admirably. The 
Trail Blazers' flop, however, was untimely. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the home team comes into tonight's Game 4 of the NBA finals trailing 2-1, 
with the prospect of encountering a different kettle of Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer, whom Buck Williams likened Monday in a nice Pacific Northwest touch, 
to a flopping salmon, will be back. Laimbeer says he has recovered from a 
multitude of bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rodman, who has fallen to the floor once or twice in his career, too, 
may also be back. Joe Dumars, originally expected to be home, remains here. 
Dumars had planned to fly to Louisiana after his father's death, but learned 
that the funeral will not be until Saturday, and decided to stay and play. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers are thus up against a Piston team close to full strength, after 
having blown Sunday's chance to kick them when they were down. 
</P>
<P>
That, according to the Blazers, was just the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer kept falling back, and the referees -- primarily the locally hated 
Jake O'Donnell -- kept whistling fouls on the Portland front line. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers Monday continued complaining about Laimbeer, blaming him for taking 
them out of their offense, but claiming they're now past caring. 
</P>
<P>
This was almost certainly done, to pre-alert the next officiating crew that the 
Blazers expect a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA doesn't announce assignments but its premier don't-mess-with-me ref, 
Earl Strom, has been spotted in town and will work tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Figure on this: Any more charging calls Laimbeer gets, he'll earn. 
</P>
<P>
But if Strom has been reading the papers . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Williams, who committed four of his six fouls against Laimbeer, called 
the Piston center "king of the floppers." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the Blazer front line was still in full cry. 
</P>
<P>
Did Laimbeer care? 
</P>
<P>
"You see the big smirk on my face," Laimbeer said, staying in character. 
"That'll answer your question." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, someone's flop is someone else's good defense. 
</P>
<P>
"They call it flopping," said Pistons Coach Chuck Daly. "I call it courage. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Bill Laimbeer had a sensational game. He took about five to seven 
charges where he was perfectly still. Did not flop. 
</P>
<P>
"He established position. Then it's the job of the referees to call it, whether 
it's a charge or a blocking foul. 
</P>
<P>
"One other point -- not many people in the league are willing to take that kind 
of punishment. They can do exactly the same thing -- stand in the lane and take 
the punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are lot of players, who would be happy to take the punishment, 
but aren't as good as Laimbeer at anticipating position. Also, lacking jumping 
ability, he is not often tempted to go for a block. 
</P>
<P>
He is, however, phenomenal at stripping the ball before an opponent jumps. Hate 
this son of affluence from Palos Verdes High, as so many do, or love him as 
Detroit fans do, and surely someone somewhere must, but there is no denying his 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Also, to Laimbeer's credit, when the call goes against him, he may rave and 
wave but afterward he sucks it up. For instance, he has never complained about 
his touch foul that sent Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the foul line for the deciding 
points in 1988's pivotal Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
If the Laimbeer debate was business as usual, more to the point is the shooting 
of the Piston guards. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars, Isiah Thomas and Vinnie Johnson went 26 for 43 Sunday. Dumars had been 
at 42% in Games 1 and 2. Johnson was three for 25 over four games. 
</P>
<P>
Portland Coach Rick Adelman was distressed that the Pistons shot so very well 
-- and were so very open. 
</P>
<P>
"The very first shot Vinnie took, wide open, 10 feet from the basket, no one 
around him," Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd done a very good job of getting to him early in games, making sure he 
didn't get going. Sunday we didn't do that and he did to us what he's done to a 
lot of teams. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to hold a good offensive player like him down forever. I was 
hoping we would for another week. It would have made our life a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be shocked if they shot that well again. If you make it tough on 'em, 
they won't do that well. If we do that, we're going to be just fine."

NBA FINALS NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
DALY SAYS RILEY HAD SUBSTANCE AS WELL AS STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
They were rivals for years in the NBA scene and the GQ look, and may turn out 
to be co-workers, so Chuck Daly did not let Pat Riley's departure from the 
Lakers pass without notice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs was a bond elevated by consecutive championship-round meetings between 
the Lakers and Detroit Pistons. That a platoon of tailors could be kept in 
business by either's vast wardrobe of Italian garb made the connection more of 
a natural. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a challenge -- particularly the dressing part of it," Daly joked before 
the Pistons' practice in preparation for Game 4 of the NBA finals. "He was such 
a superb dresser that the challenge was always there. Plus, he looks like a 
movie star. He's got that mysterious look. Much younger, so it was an uphill 
climb. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball-wise, he did a superb job. Yes, he had great personnel. But I think 
(reporters) recognized by making him coach of the year what kind of job he had 
done over the years. It's not always easy to coach great personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Riley's announcement, of course, only increased speculation surrounding Daly's 
future after seven seasons and three consecutive finals appearances with the 
Pistons. Both have met with NBC executives regarding a move to television next 
season when the NBA switches networks, and it would not be a surprise for both 
to end up there. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people should wait a while and let Pat Riley make his next move and 
then fit the pieces together," said former Atlanta Coach Mike Fratello, here as 
a commentator for Sports News Network. "Pat is not spur of the moment. He is 
very calculated and acts things out in his mind. I think we'll see what he 
does, and then it'll make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Daly side-stepped the issue of a Piston-Laker alumni reunion, but at 
the same time leaned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm coaching the Detroit Pistons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And next year? 
</P>
<P>
"One never knows." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a definitive statement about a return for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Add fashion: The latest in footwear from Piston forward Dennis Rodman, who 
previously modeled ice bags and wires connected to an electrical machine around 
his injured left ankle, was an inflated blue sleeve that circulated cold water 
around the joint. An air cast, it was called. 
</P>
<P>
All this to help him get back to the lineup after skipping Game 3 because of 
the continuing ankle problem. Ben Paolucci, the Piston team physician, listed 
Rodman as questionable for tonight, but quickly added that he could go. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have played (Sunday), but the plan was to hold him out unless we 
absolutely need him," Paolucci said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodman said he doesn't expect to play. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler, Portland's primary scorer, dropped to 42.5% in the 19 playoff 
games after making only nine of 23 shots in Game 3. He missed 14 times in the 
second half, when he appeared to be trying to shoot the Trail Blazers back into 
the game with jumpers, a tactic the Pistons would gladly take instead of 
penetration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Clyde was trying to get something done," Coach Rick Adelman said. 
"There were not a lot of guys giving us any offense, so maybe he was trying a 
little too hard to take over the game." 
</P>
<P>
But Adelman hasn't talked to Drexler about not pressing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in that," he said. "I might talk to him about slowing down or 
taking his time, but nothing about shot selection or when he shoots. Clyde is 
such a creative player and I don't want to take away any of that creativity." 
</P>
<P>
Drexler made one of his six three-point shots but he bristled at the notion 
that the intent was to lift the Blazers single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope," he said. "It's a team game. I always want to get everyone involved. I'm 
not Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
Take that any way you want. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Mark Aguirre on teammate Bill Laimbeer and his not-so-subtle 
strongman tactics: 
</P>
<P>
"Bill gets everyone irritated. I don't know a game when he hasn't irritated the 
other team. I love to play with him, but I'd sure try to punch him out if I 
played against him."

First baseman Glenn Davis of the Houston Astros apologized to the organization, 
teammates, fans and news media Monday for published comments about his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a mistake and I'd like to restate myself and put to rest any 
misunderstanding about my contract," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, Glenn Davis is concerned about one thing, helping this 
team improve." 
</P>
<P>
Davis receives a base salary of $1.985 million and cannot become a free agent 
until 1991. But he told the Houston Chronicle last Thursday that he wanted a 
multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going into next season without some kind of solution to this," Davis 
was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"The more it started coming out, the more I saw that this was not Glenn Davis," 
Davis said of the story. 
</P>
<P>
"After reading some of the things, I personally want to apologize to the team."

THE WORLD CUP;

<P>
POLICE, WET WEATHER KEEP FANS IN CHECK AS IRISH TIE ENGLISH

<P>
Scrappy Ireland rallied for a second-half goal and tied favored England, 1-1, 
Monday night in its World Cup debut. 
</P>
<P>
Massive Italian security precautions, ranging from military helicopters to huge 
police dogs, shut out English soccer hooligans who came early, cheered quickly 
-- and went home wet. 
</P>
<P>
Short of attacking ideas, slow to find the open man, neither team was 
convincing in playing to the 1990 Cup's first draw. For most of the game, the 
weather -- a stiff wind off the sea, an awesome lightning display and a chilly 
second-half rain -- provided more spectacle than action by England's whites and 
Ireland's greens. 
</P>
<P>
With frequent passes going astray and the ball constantly floating in the air, 
the quality of play was a notch below what Italy, Brazil and West Germany have 
brought to the Cup, and particularly disappointing for England, one of the 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"We had it won -- and lost it," said England's Coach Bobby Robson. "We made a 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Attacker Gary Lineker of London's Tottenham Hotspurs put England ahead after 
eight minutes on what, after nine games, might have been the tournament's 
ugliest goal. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Waddle lifted a pass over the Irish center backs, goalkeeper Patrick 
Bonner committed but could not control the ball, and Lineker chased it into the 
back of the net in a tangle with two disconsolate Irish fullbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"A scrappy, awful goal," Irish Coach Jack Charlton said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sheedy missed Ireland's best chance in the first half, from six yards 
out, but got the equalizer in the 72nd minute on a field by then slick with 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
Sheedy, who plays for Everton in the English League First Division, controlled 
a deflected pass after it was mishandled by defender Steve McMahon of 
Liverpool, who had entered as a substitute a few minutes before. 
</P>
<P>
Making the most of McMahon's miscue, Sheedy drilled it smartly into the extreme 
corner of the net with a thundering left foot that gave venerable English 
goalkeeper Peter Shilton no chance. 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, Liverpool's McMahon got the game's only yellow card as the 
teams exchanged weak chances, and the pace slackened into a draw rhythm. 
Overall, Ireland had seven shots, and England five. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland's Charlton, a former English star, made no secret of his delight at the 
result, which gives his team a good second-round shot in its first World Cup 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"We got no less than we deserved," Charlton said in the soggy aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
Irish fans, excited, exuberant and orderly in cascades of green, white and 
orange, outdid the English in numbers, volume and good humor Monday in a 
Sardinia braced for trouble after weekend disorders stirred by young English 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
With a reported attendance of 35,238, there were nearly 5,000 empty seats in 
the bright and modern stadium that is Sardinia's joy. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody who got in to see the game first had to run the gamut of an Italian 
security crunch that was calculated to intimidate. It did. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters, troopers from three different forces, dressed for riot -- or war 
-- and cavalry enough to have saved Custer scrutinized spectators at a series 
of checkpoints on their way to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, they were watched by a high-tech network of television cameras. At 
one point, while they were still winning, English supporters began marching 
through the aisles of one section, but were joined instantly by a stern file of 
large policemen. 
</P>
<P>
When the game ended, the happy Irish left first. Once they were well on their 
way, the English stands were allowed to empty into wet streets where cabs were 
scarce, but not cops. 
</P>
<P>
With one point each after Monday's draw, England and Ireland both still must 
play powerhouse Netherlands, and Egypt, the fourth team in Group F. 
</P>
<P>
And with one point in hand, a victory over weak Egypt would mean three points 
and enough for advancement for both England and Ireland, no matter what happens 
to them against the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch, potential finalists, play their opener tonight against Egypt in 
Palermo. 
</P>
<P>
England plays the Netherlands here Saturday in a game that is most potentially 
troubling to Italian police, since a dangerous minority of Dutch fans are as 
violence prone as their English counterparts.

MAGIC, COOPER LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING FOR THEIR NEW COACH

<TEXT>
<P>
Magic Johnson, through his personal publicist, issued the following statement 
Monday about Pat Riley's resignation as Laker coach and Mike Dunleavy's 
appointment: 
</P>
<P>
"Pat Riley has helped me grow as a basketball player as well as a man and I 
will always love him for it. Pat was much more than a coach to me, he has been 
my friend and a inspiration. When I was down, he was able to pick me up and 
help make me the best basketball player and person that I could be. When I'm 
older and somebody talks about 'Showtime,' the first person I'll think of is 
Pat Riley. . . . I wish Pat the best of luck in whatever he does, and I will 
definitely miss him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited to start working with Mike Dunleavy and I am confident that he 
will help us achieve our goal and return the championship to the Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cooper, who has been with the Lakers for 11 seasons, said Monday that 
he, too, will miss Riley. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing was, it was his decision," Cooper said. "This thing wasn't 
forced on him." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if a coaching change were needed, Cooper said it was not his place to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"Only management could tell you that," Cooper said. "We've done so many great 
things under Pat. . . . (But) the NBA is changing a lot. Coach Riley had his 
philosophy as far as coaching, and he went about it that way. It worked for us 
in the past. In the early '80s, it worked great." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Dunleavy's reported low key approach, as opposed to Riley's intense 
manner, Cooper said: "Too much basketball wears you out. If (Dunleavy) is low 
key and knows when to back off, it'll help. But I'm sure he'll come in 
forceful, but probably not too forceful." SAM McMANIS

OVER-THE-COUNTER COLD MEDICATIONS POSE LATEST THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The winner of the 1904 Olympic marathon in St. Louis was Thomas Hicks, an 
English-born brass worker from Cambridge, Mass., who illustrated how modern 
medicine could enhance athletic performance. 
</P>
<P>
Hick's achievement, some suggest today, was bizarre, if not downright 
fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
With temperatures hovering in the 90s, Hicks took a 1 1/2-mile lead about 10 
miles from the finish. But like some other competitors, he became overwhelmed 
by exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of resting him, doctors administered an oral concoction of strychnine 
sulfate mixed with raw egg white. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks staggered onward. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles later he began to struggle again. He drank more strychnine, this 
time mixed with brandy. 
</P>
<P>
Each time he faded, Hicks was revived by another shot and eventually won by six 
minutes. Fortunately for him, the race wasn't any longer than it was. He might 
well have died of strychnine poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks' is one of the more celebrated cases of victory aided by chemicals. But 
for as long as athletes have struggled to succeed, there have been experiments 
with artificial enhancements. 
</P>
<P>
The latest drugs to surface on the track and field scene en masse are 
stimulants found innocently enough in over-the-counter cold medications. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Myricks, Greg Foster and Antonio McKay were suspended for three months 
this year aftertesting positive for stimulants banned by the International 
Olympic Committee and International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). 
</P>
<P>
Still, track officials are not taking the problem seriously, according to Dr. 
Robert Voy, a sports medicine specialist in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Although official and media attention have focused primarily on anabolic 
steroids, an equal number of U.S. athletes have tested positive for such 
stimulants as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine in recent 
years, Voy said. 
</P>
<P>
Voy resigned as the U.S. Olympic Committee's chief medical officer last summer 
partly because a feud developed when USOC leadership ignored growing misuse of 
stimulants, Voy said last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a much happier person, not being frustrated by the system that didn't 
allow me to be forthright and accomplish what I wanted to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike steroids, the stimulants are used during competition. Athletes who take 
steroids do so to enhance their training and usually discontinue use by the 
time they compete. 
</P>
<P>
But athletes needing an immediate boost might take a stimulant. Either that, or 
many are getting colds the day of meets. 
</P>
<P>
Stimulants include various types of drugs that increase alertness, reduce 
fatigue and give athletes such as sprinters and jumpers sudden bursts of 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, they are stimulating the system," Voy said. 
</P>
<P>
These drugs are known as look-alikes because they mimic the actions of 
amphetamines and, to some extent, cocaine. They are found in such household 
products as Nyquil Nighttime Cold Medicine, Alka-Seltzer Plus, Contac, Actifed, 
Chlorafed and Sudafed. 
</P>
<P>
Ephedrine also is found in a Chinese herb called ma huang. The substance is 
used in vitamins and mineral preparations to give the consumer a quick lift, 
but otherwise has no redeeming value in a vitamin tablet, physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
Stimulants are added to cough and cold medicines to counterbalance 
antihistamines, which cause drowsiness. 
</P>
<P>
"Where maybe one dose of an Actifed won't stimulate you, three or four tablets 
can act as a very good stimulant to the central nervous system," Voy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem that I have seen all along is the gradual increased use of these 
products because they're easy to get and not considered illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Voy said one of the major debates in the sporting community is whether 
stimulants are as strong as amphetamines, cocaine or strychnine. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Manfred Donike, a West German pharmacologist serving on the IAAF's medical 
commission, said doctors and administrators have problems differentiating 
between justified therapy and doping. He believes the problem will remain 
unresolved for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF, which governs international track and field, stipulates that any 
positive test for a stimulant with fewer than 10 micrograms per milliliter is 
invalid. That was to protect athletes who took the drugs for medical purposes. 
Officials reasoned that such a low dosage would not enhance performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics Congress, the governing body for U.S. track and field, revised 
its rules last year to say that any positive test is valid. Officials wanted 
stricter rules for American athletes to help reduce the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Donike, internationally known for advances in the testing of steroids, said the 
stimulant question is concentrated in the United States, Canada and Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be an Anglo-Saxon problem," he said from Cologne, West Germany. 
"There seems to be an attitude problem there. Using over-the-counter 
medications is easy." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Donald Catlin, director of the IOC's drug laboratory at UCLA, said 
international use of stimulants has not changed much in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Donike cited the International Cycling Federation's work in eradicating the 
stimulant problem from its sport. For years, stimulant use in cycling was 
rampant. 
</P>
<P>
Donike said education and strict enforcement have helped cycling officials 
overcome the problems, although the sport's image remains tainted when the 
subject is drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Stimulants have been used in other sports as well. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Parrish, formerly a defensive back with the Cleveland Browns, wrote 
about the first time he and a teammate took amphetamines in his 1972 book, 
"They Call It a Game." 
</P>
<P>
"We were wild-eyed and rowdy . . . Doctors say that (amphetamines) do not have 
any real effect on one's performance, but we were convinced they were great. I 
never played another game in my college or professional career without taking 
either Dexedrine or Benzedrine." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas amphetamines and cocaine concern society, the drugs found in the cold 
medications do not command the same scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get terribly concerned about ephedrine," said Dr. Bob Goldman, 
chairman of the Medical and Doping Committee for the International Federation 
of Bodybuilders. "You'd have to take a fair amount for it to work like speed. 
</P>
<P>
"It also can be counter productive. Taking something like (cold medication) 
makes them a little sedated, so they're almost at ground zero again." 
</P>
<P>
Voy understands the doubts in the medical community. He said medical literature 
does not support the theory that ephedrine works to enhance performance. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was like when we first encountered steroids," he said. "The literature 
said it wouldn't work, but all the athletes wanted to know where they could get 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Pure scientific literature might not prove beyond a shadow of a doubt what the 
effects are and how they can enhance, but that doesn't negate the fact an 
athlete can do better while on the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"That can't be scientifically investigated. There will be a big argument in the 
scientific community and they never will be able to prove it until they teach a 
laboratory rat to throw a javelin, or a dog to run 100 meters." 
</P>
<P>
Voy said athletes have told him they use the substances strictly for 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Voy said that one test revealed an athlete had an ephedrine level equivalent to 
four to eight ounces of cough syrup taken at once. 
</P>
<P>
Catlin said studies from the 1950s show that amphetamines enhance performance 
for runners and swimmers. He also said the latest rumor is that stimulants 
interact with anabolic steroids for a better hormonal effect, but he has no 
evidence of that. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, the NCAA removed ephedrine and its derivatives from its banned 
substance list, a move away from stopping the misuse, Voy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you will see college athletes using this because they can get by with it," 
Voy said.

DYKSTRA'S STREAK ENDS AT 23 GAMES; PHILLIES DROP TWO TO THE EXPOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Len Dykstra's 23-game hitting streak ended Monday night, just the way Kevin 
Gross predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before the game he wasn't going to get a hit off me. I really wanted to 
stop him," Gross said after he shut down Dykstra and the Phillies in the 
Montreal Expos' 5-0 victory in the first game of a doubleheader at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos rallied in the second game to win, 3-2, and complete the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra struck out, walked, flied out and grounded out in the first game, 
ending the longest hitting streak this season. He was 0-5 in the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not even too sure Lenny cares about the streak," Manager Nick Leyva said. 
"I really don't think there was that much pressure on him. He just wanted to 
come to the park and get hits." 
</P>
<P>
But Gross was determined to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he had a streak going. It gave me something to go for," said Gross, who 
threw a four-hitter. "But I've always pitched him tough." 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra batted .429 (42-for-98) during the stretch. Three times he had needed a 
hit in his final at-bat and got it, but not Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra, batting in the eighth inning, hit a routine grounder to first baseman 
Andres Galarraga in his last at-bat, and received a standing ovation on his way 
back to the dugout. He was three batters away from getting up again when the 
game ended. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra finished tied for the fourth-longest hitting streak in Phillies' 
history. Chuck Klein set the mark of 30 in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
Gross (8-4) gave up four singles, struck out nine and walked four in his first 
shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fitzgerald, elevated in the third spot in the batting order, homered and 
drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Cook (5-2), winless in his last five starts, got the loss. In the second 
game the Expos broke a 2-2 tie in the eighth inning on a wild pitch by Jeff 
Parrett (2-5). 
</P>
<P>
Andres Galarraga led off with a single, pinch-runner Otis Nixon took third on 
Parrett's wild pickoff and scored as ball four to Mike Aldrete bounced to the 
backstop. 
</P>
<P>
Drew Hall (4-6) was the winning pitcher and Dave Schmidt earned his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 8, Atlanta 3 -- The Giants won for the ninth time in 10 games as 
Brett Butler's run-scoring double snapped a seventh-inning tie at Atlanta. The 
resurgent Giants won three of four from the Braves, scoring 43 runs in the 
series, to move within two games of the .500 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Robby Thompson singled with one out in the seventh and Butler doubled with two 
outs to put the Giants ahead 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Garrelts (3-6) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings to 
improve his lifetime record against the Braves to 10-4. Jeff Brantley got two 
outs in the seventh and Steve Bedrosian finished. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants pulled away with three runs in the eighth on Matt Williams' RBI 
single and a two-run single by Mike Kingery. Kingery is 7-for-15 with seven 
RBIs since being recalled from Phoenix on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves tied the score 3-3 in the sixth inning when Oddibe McDowell led off 
with his fifth homer. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 8, New York 5 -- Ryne Sandberg had four hits, including a home run, and 
Mark Grace added three hits to lead the Cubs to their MMondfourth straight win 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In his last 11 games, Grace has reached base safely 22 times in 39 plate 
appearances (16 hits and six walks) to raise his average from .258 to .292. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, who had their three-game winning streak snapped, fell to 7-15 on the 
road. They have three more games with the Cubs at Wrigley Field before going to 
Pittsburgh for four games. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Alejandro Pena (1-2) walked Dwight Smith leading off the seventh and 
one out later Sandberg singled Smith to third. Grace, who has hit in 14 
straight games, put the Cubs ahead 5-4 with a grounder to third. Following two 
walks, Curtis Wilkerson's two-run single made it 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
After Mike Marshall's RBI single in the eighth moved the Mets within two, 
Sandberg's third single of the game put the Cubs ahead 8-5. Sandberg has 25 
hits in his last 51 at-bats and is now hitting .342. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Maddux had retired 15 in a row entering the seventh when the Mets rallied 
for three runs to tie the score at 4-4. Marshall, Mackey Sasser and 
pinch-hitter Dave Magadan had RBI singles. After Magadan's single, Mitch 
Williams (1-5) relieved and the Mets loaded the bases with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
Williams went to a 3-0 count on Howard Johnson but came back to get a 
strikeout. Paul Assenmacher pitched two innings for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 8, St. Louis 7 -- Doug Drabek failed to protect a six-run lead, but 
Jeff King snapped an eighth-inning tie with a run-scoring single as the Pirates 
broke a three-game losing streak at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Lind doubled leading off the eighth against reliever Tom Niedenfuer (0-1) 
and advanced on a groundout before King drove him in with his third hit of the 
game to make it 7-6. Jay Bell followed with his second RBI triple of the night 
as the Pirates sent St. Louis to its fourth loss in five games. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero got his 200th career homer and had three RBIs for the Cardinals, 
who fell into last place in the National League East, 10 1/2 games behind the 
division-leading Pirates. Guerrero's seventh homer was his first since May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Belinda (2-1), the third Pittsburgh pitcher, was the winner despite giving 
up a game-tying RBI double to Todd Zeile in the seventh. Bill Landrum finished 
for his ninth save.

CRUCIAL WEEK ON TAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is expected to push the government's cautious 
plan to open the Soviet economy to market forces before lawmakers today, 
kicking off a crucial legislative test for the interim program this week. 
</P>
<P>
Critics on one side say the plan doesn't go far enough, while opponents at the 
other extreme condemn it as "creeping capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
If the Supreme Soviet, or legislature, rejects the program, it may lead to the 
resignation of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, or at least his main economic 
advisers. Gorbachev has already said the rescue plan may have been poorly 
presented. He said it is intended to provide a transition period during which a 
complex package of more than 30 new economic laws and decrees are prepared.

<TEXT>
<P>
After three years of diplomacy that helped end a guerrilla war in Nicaragua and 
launch peace talks in El Salvador and Guatemala, Central America's presidents 
will turn to an economic agenda when they meet in nearby Antigua this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Without joint efforts to pull the region out of a decade-old recession, 
officials believe, their achievements in peacemaking and in strengthening 
democracy will be fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua are led by conservative 
presidents who have taken office within the last year. They share an interest 
with host Guatemala in acting as a bloc in world trade, dealings with 
creditors, and economic development.

ISLAMIC ELECTION TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Algerians go to the polls today in the country's first multi-party elections 
since it gained independence from France in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders from all over the Middle East will be watching the results closely as 
candidates from more than 20 newly legalized parties contest seats on 1,541 
local councils. The reason: Algeria has the Arab world's only legalized Islamic 
party, which is expected to mount the most serious challenge to the ruling 
National Liberation Front. The widely supported Front of Socialist Forces is 
boycotting the poll, arguing there was not enough time to prepare. 
</P>

Algeria's first national, multi-party elections are scheduled for 1992.

RITA, HER DRESS, AND OTHER NEWS (?) FROM ISRAEL'S PRESS; 
</P>
<P>
LIGHT STORIES ARE NOT USUALLY THE STUFF OF MOST NEWSPAPERS IN THE JEWISH STATE. 
HOWEVER, A FEW ODDS ONES DO TURN UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are few news stories that can consistently compete for drama with the 
long-running government crisis here, what with its themes of betrayal, greed, 
secret deals, name-calling and perpetually colliding egos. But in feeling 
around the innards of Israel's numerous newspapers, a few gems turn up. 
</P>
<P>
Light news is not the stuff of some newspapers; Haaretz, a left-center daily, 
wouldn't be caught dead publishing an article on an earring that induces 
diet-free weight loss, which ran recently in Yediot Aharonot, the country's 
largest daily. 
</P>
<P>
Often, there seems to be little room for anything but the day's news, there 
being so many pressing issues in the air: politics, the Palestinian uprising, 
the economy, the influx of Soviet Jews, secular-religious disputes. What space 
is left over often goes to features pertaining to Jewish identity (how to make 
a kosher home, the history of one battle or another in the building of the 
Israeli state). 
</P>
<P>
Still, when the offbeat story pops up, Israeli newspapers sometimes run 
variations on them for days, delighting in polemics over the most minor issues. 
The more bizarre the twists and turns, the better. 
</P>
<P>
For a few days last month, it seems that everybody forgot about the politicians 
to concentrate on Rita and her dress. Rita is one of the country's most popular 
singers -- and is as well-known for her figure as her voice. 
</P>
<P>
Isolated in the Middle East, Israel likes to feel itself part of the world at 
large and especially the Western world, so there was great anticipation for 
Rita's appearance in a recent European song festival, to be held in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
But wait, newspapers cautioned. What about that skimpy red dress she likes to 
wear? Won't that put off the judges? Won't it reflect badly on Israel? 
</P>
<P>
The debate went on right up to contest time. The singer's manager promised she 
would not wriggle. "Rita will adopt a more static posture," he pledged. The 
dress plans were kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Rita sang, wearing a long black skirt made of strips that parted at 
the slightest breeze. She came in 18th out of 22 contestants. For days 
afterward, the argument raged: Was it the dress, the song or anti-Israeli 
judges that caused the debacle?

The visit of a celebrity to Israel from abroad sometimes causes great 
excitement. Israel is small, so it's not hard to make a splash here. When 
someone like Diego Maradona, the Argentine soccer star, arrives, it's a major 
event. Israel is soccer crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona came with his teammates to play a game with Israel's national team as 
a warm-up for the World Cup matches in Italy. The game drew less attention than 
his visit to the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that four years ago, just before Mexico hosted the last World Cup, 
Maradona made a similar visit. He prayed and put a message to God in the 
crevices of the Wall, then went off to star in Argentina's tournament victory. 
So he came again this year and left five messages in the Wall. He also prayed 
at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher supposedly built over Christ's tomb, 
presumably for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
The dual visits prompted the English-language Jerusalem Post to speculate that 
if Egypt or the United Arab Emirates win this year's cup, Maradona might travel 
to Mecca next time around. 
</P>
<P>
News in one place in Israel can easily set off a copycat event somewhere else, 
it seems. Not long ago, residents in the Negev Desert were campaigning against 
joint U.S.-Israeli construction of a Voice of America broadcast tower. Among 
their complaints were expected health hazards caused by radiation emanating 
from the tower. Headaches, literally, were expected. 
</P>
<P>
Well, over in Givat Yam, residents began to complain of headaches and 
dizziness, from a telephone transmission tower they want to get rid of. Tests 
are being carried out. 
</P>
<P>
Stories of squashed Jewish-Muslim love affairs appear on occasion. Recently, 
one detailed the romance of an anonymous Palestinian woman and Israeli secret 
agent in Lebanon. Another detailed a sordid affair between an Israeli 
occupation soldier and a Palestinian woman in the West Bank. She said they were 
in love. He said she was loose. 
</P>
<P>
Kids and rare births also get a lot of attention. Just the other day, a woman 
gave birth to a boy conceived from a frozen embryo and -- here's the twist -- 
he is the twin of his 2-year-old sister who was conceived from the same group 
of eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no equivalents of the National Enquirer here, with headlines 
like these (from Yediot Aharonot), there isn't much need: 
</P>
<P>
MY HUSBAND LOST ME AT CARDS 
</P>
<P>
"My husband, the gambler, had no money left and so decided to use me as a wager 
in his card game," claims a wife demanding alimony in a Tel Aviv court. 
</P>
<P>
"After my husband 'lost' me, he forced me to devote myself to one of his 
friends -- this in place of paying 2000 shekels. After I refused, he hit me 
until the blood flowed." 
</P>
<P>
Or this one: 
</P>
<P>
PRISONER COVERED HIMSELF IN GARBAGE -- BUT CAUGHT AT MUNICIPAL DUMP 
</P>
<P>
"A prisoner, imprisoned at the Nizan jail in Ramle, escaped without arousing 
any suspicion. He hid inside a large garbage container and was only captured a 
number of hours later by the border police at the municipal garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoner, Zacharia Barzili, 40, of Raanana, worked in the prison kitchen. 
When the Ramle municipal truck arrived to collect the garbage, Barzili climbed 
into the container and covered himself with garbage. 
</P>
<P>
When the garbage truck began to offload at the municipal dump, the workers were 
stunned when they saw a man emerge from the container and run off. The workers 
gave chase and, with the help of a passing border police patrol, trapped the 
escaped prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course: 
</P>
<P>
UFO SIGHTING 
</P>
<P>
"I saw eight gigantic lights, like very powerful spotlights, hanging on the 
horizon. I froze in fear from the sight, and felt like an actor in a science 
fiction movie," a witness said. 
</P>
<P>
"A swift investigation by the police revealed that an army operation involving 
helicopters and flares was the cause of the panic."

BRITISH RESERVE EXTENDS DOWN THE (TELEPHONE) LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A survey for British Telecom, the UK telephone company, shows Britons much less 
likely to make casual telephone calls than their American cousins. "It seems 
that in Britain, we cling to the notion that we should only make calls to 
friends or relatives when we have some definite news or information to impart," 
the company concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of simply ringing for a chat is one that still seems alien to the 
British. No such inhibitions affect the Americans, however." 
</P>
<P>
14% of Britons call to say thank you after a dinner party; 22% of Americans do. 
</P>
<P>
Moe than twice as many Americans (33%) as Britons (14%) call to offer 
congratulations to friends on some auspicious event, such as the birth of a 
child or successful completion of school exams. 
</P>
<P>
Three times as many Americans (45%) as Britons (14%) call to offer sympathy to 
a friend who is ill or who has suffered some misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
Only 17% of Britons call home to warn their spouses/partners that they would be 
late getting home because of an office party, and women (12%) were the worst 
offenders. In America, 23% say they call home. 
</P>
<P>
And if they're not much for chit-chat to fellow human beings, you can be sure 
Britons won't talk to machines. Fewer than 3% have telephone answering 
machines, compared with 14% of Americans.

<P>
YUGOSLAVIA: A CENTER THAT ISN'T HOLDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The News: 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavian President Borislav Jovic has called for a new federal constitution 
and negotiations among the six member republics to prevent a breakup of the 
multinational state. Its future is threatened by an epidemic of nationalism, a 
power struggle between Communists and pro-democracy forces, secession movements 
in Slovenia and Croatia and looming economic threats including a rise in 
unemployment already at 17%. For many, the question is no longer whether the 
fragile federation will collapse, but when. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background: 
</P>
<P>
National rivalries among the Balkan nations have never been resolved. Eight 
fractious kingdoms and provinces were merged in 1918 after the collapse of the 
Austro-Hungarian and Turkish Ottoman empires after World War I. Political and 
ethnic conflicts escalated into civil war by the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Communist partisan Josip Broz Tito emerged to lead the federation after World 
War II and managed through personal influence and political repression to keep 
nationalist outbreaks in check. The constitution drafted six years before his 
death in 1980 bequeathed a rotating system of leadership designed to prevent 
any of the six republics or two autonomous provinces from dominating. But 
Serbian-orchestrated changes to the constitution in March, 1989, stripped the 
province of Kosovo of its autonomy, triggering riots by majority Albanians and 
a crackdown by Serbs who are less than 10% of Kosovo's 2 million population. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the nationalist tensions is the uneven development of democracy in 
Yugoslavia. Slovenia and Croatia, the two most prosperous and westernized 
republics, held multi-party elections this spring that brought in 
anti-Communist governments. Three of the other four republics -- 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Macedonia -- have scheduled free elections 
later this year. Serbia, however, remains a hard-line Communist state and has 
resisted calls for pluralism. A democratic vote would unquestionably restore 
Kosovo to ethnic Albanian control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Issue: 
</P>
<P>
While most of the republics have shifted toward Western-style democracy, the 
federal government retains a Communist monopoly on political power even though 
it has undertaken market-oriented economic reforms. Prime Minister Ante 
Markovic has called for nationwide free elections by the end of the year and 
has said he may form a new party to challenge his fellow Communists. But 
federal elections cannot be held before all republics have legalized opposition 
parties and begun the transition to multi-party democracies. The Markovic 
appeal has put new pressure on Serbia to relax its one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personalities: 
</P>
<P>
Serbian Communist Party chief Slobodan Milosevic rose to power by engineering 
the constitutional changes last year that imposed Serbian authority on Kosovo, 
the historic heartland of the medieval kingdom of Serbia. The move bolstered 
national pride among Serbs, who account for 9 million of Yugoslavia's 23 
million citizens, but touched off recurring ethnic clashes with Albanians who 
want their own republic in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
Federal President Jovic is a hard-line Communist Serb allied with Milosevic and 
likewise opposed to multi-party democracy. He has warned that rising 
nationalism threatens to escalate into civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Markovic, a Croat, is the first strong federal figure to emerge 
in Yugoslavia since Tito. He is popular for taming hyper-inflation and 
introducing market-oriented reforms that have eased Yugoslavia's economic 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
While Markovic struggles to keep the federation together, strong nationalist 
figures have emerged in the largest republics. Franjo Tudjman, a Croatian 
nationalist and former dissident, was elected republic president last month. 
Vuk Draskovic of the unsanctioned and strongly nationalist Serbian Renewal 
Party is providing a magnet for Serbs disillusioned with communism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
Serbia clears the federal reform roadblock by scheduling multi-party elections, 
but only after rewriting the republic's constitution to prevent Kosovo's ever 
gaining republic status; the most likely move, but one expected to trigger a 
bloody uprising by ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
* Serbia legalizes opposition parties but outlaws the Democratic League 
supported by Kosovo Albanians; also likely to set off rioting. 
</P>
<P>
* Serbia is forced in negotiations with the other republics to agree to free 
elections without restricting Kosovo's status; considered unlikely due to the 
Serbs' strong national identification with Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
* No elections are set in Serbia, delaying federal pluralism and further 
fueling the secessionist movements in Croatia and Slovenia and leading to the 
breakup of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
* One of the newly democratized republics declares independence from the 
federation, and the army under the control of the Serbian-dominated presidency 
is brought in to prevent secession, unleashing civil war.

SOVIET ANTI-SEMITISM SURGES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Long a poison in Soviet life, anti-Semitism has again surged into the public 
eye, but far more blatantly now because of the wider latitude for 
self-expression allowed under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The response of worried Soviet Jewry has been a massive exodus that by some 
estimates could lead to the departure of 750,000 people -- half the country's 
Jewish population -- in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all apprehensive -- anti-Semitism is very much on the rise," said 
Arkady A. Pevzner, producer at Moscow's Jewish Theater. "Many Jews do not want 
to emigrate, but we call this evacuation -- we are getting out of the danger 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
In what for many seems a terrifying return to the persecutions suffered by 
their ancestors, there have been recurring threats of pogroms, most recently on 
May 5 -- the birthday of Karl Marx, who was Jewish. According to Soviet 
officials and Jewish groups alike, nothing has happened. 
</P>
<P>
But many Jews hardly consider that a guarantee for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I have denounced Jewish emigrants before, but now I do not, because emigrants 
are people who want to save their lives, to survive physically," a 31-year-old 
Jewish mother from Dnepropetrovsk wrote a Soviet newspaper. "My happy life is 
over for me. I am crying all the time." 
</P>
<P>
It is a sad irony, but the liberalization of society that Gorbachev has wrought 
has allowed the venting of every sort of extremist view, nationalism and 
xenophobia included. In the past two years, hundreds of people have been killed 
in brutal ethnic clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, Uzbeks and 
Meskhetian Turks, Kazakhs and Caucasus migrants. The Kremlin's more liberal 
ways have lifted the lid off long-suppressed national grudges and allowed them 
to be printed, broadcast and proclaimed out loud. 
</P>
<P>
That is also the case with anti-Semitism, no stranger in a land where for more 
than a century, Jews were forced by the czars to live within a ghetto known as 
the "Pale of Settlement," and where the word pogrom, meaning "like thunder," 
was coined to describe the often officially sponsored massacre or persecution 
of a minority group. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, the government's policy has veered toward anti-Semitism, but the 
recent renaissance of anti-Jewish feeling is quite different. Now, there is a 
"new neo-Nazi type which is not supported by the state," Mikhail Chlenov, 
co-president of Va'ad, an umbrella council for Soviet Jewish organizations, 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the official intention, the policy of glasnost means those feelings 
can be more freely expressed by ultranationalist Russian groups such as Pamyat, 
or Memory, and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Pamyat leader Dmitri Vasiliev, appearing on state-run television, 
recently suggested that "leading Zionists" were somehow implicated in the empty 
store shelves and other aspects of economic chaos that prevail in the sixth 
year of Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gorbachev, there has been a palpable rebirth of Jewish religion and 
culture in the Soviet Union, from the opening of a Jewish restaurant in Moscow 
-- Joseph's Place -- to government approval for the creation of the country's 
first rabbinical school in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those positive steps, the widespread concern and fear of Soviet Jews, 
plus the far greater possibilities people here now have been granted for 
foreign travel, are fueling the Jewish exodus. 
</P>
<P>
According to White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, Gorbachev agreed 
during his summit talks with President Bush in Washington to speak out against 
anti-Semitism. But whether his words can stem the outflow of Soviet Jews is an 
open question.

Fred Sands to Buy Fresno Radio Station: In what would be his second radio 
station purchase in as many months, Southland realtor Fred C. Sands has agreed 
to buy Fresno radio station KRZR-FM from Olympia Broadcasting Corp. for $1.5 
million. The sale is subject to approval by the Federal Communications 
Commission. On April 10, Sands, who already owns rock music station KNAC-FM in 
Long Beach, agreed to buy rap station KDAY-AM in Los Angeles for $7.2 million.

THRIFTS: THE HEAD OF THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE SAYS THE ADMINISTRATION 
HASN'T ASKED FOR ENOUGH FUNDS TO PURSUE THE PERPETRATORS.

Joining a rising chorus of political anger over savings and loan fraud, Senate 
Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) on Monday called for 
"a more aggressive crackdown" on the white-collar criminals who helped cripple 
the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for additional investigative and prosecutorial resources is 
unlimited," Riegle said in a major Senate speech. He accused the Bush 
Administration of failing to ask for enough funds to pursue the perpetrators of 
financial fraud. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokesman fired back at Riegle, saying "it's too 
simplistic to suggest more money means more cases investigated and prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L fraud cases "are hard cases to make," said Douglas Tillett, the Justice 
Department spokesman. "We have to bring evidence and prove guilt -- members of 
Congress can hold a press conference and not be accountable for their grand 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Riegle, a key author of the 1989 S&amp;L rescue bill that provided funding for 
the sale or shutdown of hundreds of insolvent thrifts, added his influential 
voice to a new wave of criticism sweeping through Congress. Lawmakers are among 
those having to cope with the political fallout from the biggest financial 
scandal in American history. 
</P>
<P>
Because savings deposits are insured up to $100,000, taxpayers will bear the 
massive financial burden for cleaning up the defunct S&amp;Ls and disposing of 
their assets. The Bush Administration said last month that the cleanup cost had 
been badly underestimated. It said it would need as much as $60 billion more 
for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Although the complexities of the scandal have been slow to penetrate the public 
consciousness, politicians draw big applause when they call for retribution 
against those who helped loot S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Congress authorized $75 million for prosecuting thrift fraud, but the 
Administration limited its request to $49 million, Riegle said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration opposition to additional funds for savings and loan fraud 
prosecutions is difficult to reconcile with available evidence on the magnitude 
of the problems and the Justice Department's current resources," Riegle said. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department spokesman said his agency is spending the 
fraud-prosecution money effectively and doesn't need more. "To appropriate 
money in December, 1989, and expect to put people in jail in June, 1990, is a 
little unrealistic," Tillett said. The Justice Department has created 155 new 
slots for FBI agents and 118 for assistant U.S. attorneys, but needs hundreds 
more, Riegle said. 
</P>
<P>
His willingness to write a virtual blank check to pay for S&amp;L fraud 
prosecution illustrates the growing intensity of the issue on Capitol Hill. 
More than 100 House members have signed a resolution calling for a special 
prosecutor to deal with thrift fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.), joining several Democratic senators in proposing a 
special strike force last week, said: "This country is being robbed blind, and 
the crooks are getting away scot-free." 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department says it has 27 local task forces capable of doing the 
job. "You've got a lot of angry constituents raising the issue with their 
elected representatives -- and rightly so," said Tillett. "Members of Congress 
are looking for a quick solution to a problem not quickly solved." 
</P>
<P>
It takes an average of three to four years to bring a case from investigation 
to trial. Congress recognized the problem by extending the statute of 
limitations for financial fraud to 10 years from five, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cases, like other fraud committed by white-collar criminals, are difficult 
to prosecute. The crimes are intricate, the perpetrators often well-known, 
once-respected members of the business community. 
</P>
<P>
There seems scant opportunity to recover much of the billions of dollars in 
losses suffered by S&amp;Ls, federal officials believe. They feel that the 
money has melted away along with the collapse of real estate values in many 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Inflated values of land, office buildings, shopping centers and condominiums 
plunged after the markets turned bad. Those who made the biggest profit were 
the last sellers of the property before the bust, according to L. William 
Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency handling the 
dismantling of crippled S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle also was critical of efforts to dispose of failed S&amp;Ls. "While the 
pace is now accelerating, the overall progress to date must be considered 
disappointing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The government has inherited thousands of properties from defunct S&amp;Ls, 
including shopping centers, office buildings, homes and land. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no simple recipe for orderly, efficient and cost-effective 
disposition of these assets, particularly given the slack real estate markets 
in areas where the real estate inventory is largest," Riegle said. "This unique 
and very difficult problem needs the sustained attention of the administrative 
agencies, Congress and the public."

U.S. LIFTS SUSPENSION ON HUGHES UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft Co. said Monday that the Air Force has lifted its month-old 
suspension against Hughes' missile systems group headquarters in Canoga Park, 
allowing the unit to resume bidding on programs and receiving government 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The missile unit had been suspended from getting new contracts by the Air Force 
Debarment and Suspension Review Board on May 9. The suspension resulted from 
Hughes' guilty plea to two felony counts in federal court last March. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes admitted in the case that its executives illegally obtained secret 
Pentagon documents in an effort to gain competitive advantage. In pleading 
guilty, it agreed to pay $3.6 million in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the suspension, the Air Force also threatened to bar the missile 
facility from bidding on new government work for up to three years. Although 
many companies have been suspended from receiving government work, no major 
contractor is known to have been slapped with a long-term bar -- or 
"debarment," as the Air Force terms it. 
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the suspension, which was effective Monday, returns the Hughes 
unit to its status as a "responsible contractor," meaning that it has cleaned 
up its criminal problems and is now complying with government procurement 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said that, under the terms of its settlement with the Air Force, it will 
continue its companywide ethics training program, issue new procedures and 
conduct training aimed at improving its marketing and security practices. 
</P>
<P>
"With the help of the Air Force, we put together a plan of action to make sure 
that this doesn't occur again," said Hughes spokesman Richard Dore. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force spokesman confirmed Monday that the suspension had been lifted, 
but said no other details were available. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes missile systems group is based in Canoga Park and has plants in 
Tucson and LaGrange, Ga. The suspension applied only to the Canoga Park plant, 
which is the research and development center for the group. The plant has 2,100 
employees, mostly scientists and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Dore said Hughes was forced to forgo bidding on one relatively small government 
contract with an estimated value of $2 million during the suspension. The 
missile systems group had sales of more than $1 billion in 1989, Dore said. 
</P>
<P>
But a long-term suspension or debarment could have crippled the entire missile 
systems group, since the Canoga Park unit's work provides the basis for future 
programs, industry sources said at the time of the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal plea entered by Hughes was part of the large "Operation 
Undercover" criminal probe, in which GTE, Boeing and RCA also have entered 
guilty pleas. In the Hughes case, the company admitted that it had acquired 
numerous classified documents from 1978 through 1985 and filed them under false 
titles to conceal them from government auditors.

Asbestos Fund Seeks Ways to Ease Shortfall: The trust fund created in Manville 
Corp.'s bankruptcy to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases said it 
is exploring alternatives to ease a cash shortage that could delay some 
payments until the 21st Century. John C. Sawhill, chairman of the Manville 
Personal Injury Settlement Trust, issued a statement that the trust wants "to 
quickly resolve the current legal issues and return (its) attention to settling 
claims." The statement did not specify alternatives being examined by the 
trust.

KOLL CO. TO HANDLE DEVELOPMENT AT WETLANDS AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Koll Co. said Monday that it had been retained to manage the $500-million real 
estate portfolio of Henley Properties Inc., including the controversial housing 
development along the Bolsa Chica wetlands abutting Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Donald M. Koll was named president and a director of 
Henley, and his Newport Beach-based firm was hired to oversee Henley's 15 
Southern California properties and holdings in five other states. 
</P>
<P>
Henley operates in California through its subsidiary, Signal Landmark Co. in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Henley, a public company based in Hampton, N.H., nor the privately held 
Koll would disclose the value of the contract. But the management agreement is 
the largest ever for Koll, which has $4 billion worth of real estate under its 
control, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Koll and his highly respected organization will help us to accelerate the 
development of our real estate projects and undertake various transactions to 
realize the value of our holdings for the benefit of our shareholders," Michael 
D. Dingman, Henley's chairman and chief executive, said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
The contract allows Koll to participate in the profits that Henley makes from 
its projects and also to use Henley's resources to purchase major blocks of 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"My major thrust is going to be not only to manage properties but to redo some 
of the properties to try to get into large portfolios," Koll said. "We may buy 
several large properties and either develop them or spin them off." 
</P>
<P>
The management contract runs for five years with automatic one-year renewals. 
Signal Landmark's 45 employees and many of the other 150 Henley Properties 
employees will move into Koll headquarters in Newport Beach, Koll said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is exciting to us," Koll said. "We'll have a public company, 
which we will be in charge of for making profits." 
</P>
<P>
While the Koll firm is privately held, Koll himself sits on the board of Wells 
Fargo and Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Henley's biggest single holding is the 12,000-acre Bolsa Chica wetlands and 
surrounding area that its Signal Landmark unit has been working on for years to 
develop. In an intricate plan drafted last year with the city, Orange County 
and the state, Signal Landmark reached a compromise that calls for preserving 
most of the Bolsa Chica area as natural wetlands but allows up to 5,700 homes 
on 412 acres on the bluff areas.

LABOR: A MODEL FOR EAST BLOC WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is something delightfully anomalous about a campaign by America's 
worker-owned companies to persuade leaders of the Soviet Union and East 
European countries to replace their admittedly failing state-owned companies 
with worker-owned ones. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of workers owning the companies that employ them was once considered a 
radical, socialist scheme. But, while still limited, it has spread more rapidly 
in the capitalistic United States than in any other nation on earth. 
</P>
<P>
Now more than 11.5 million American workers own a significant part or all of 
their companies, and the number of firms selling or giving stock to their 
workers is growing by from 600 to 800 a year. 
</P>
<P>
To spread the good word about power sharing, 80 U.S. employee-owned companies 
last week sent letters to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other 
leaders of what were once communist countries, inviting them to send 
delegations here to learn firsthand about giving economic power to workers. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts say that because of its huge size, the almost-completed employee 
buyout of United Airlines might turn out to be a model for those countries 
because most of their state-run companies are also large. 
</P>
<P>
The United buyout will give employees the dominant voice in every major 
management decision. It will give the company's 71,000 workers full ownership 
of the nation's second-largest airline and is by far the largest such buyout 
yet in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, no plans have yet been made to give the United worker-owners a 
role in day-to-day top management decisions or even in decision making related 
to their own individual jobs. That isn't unusual in worker-owned companies, but 
the system functions best when workers are involved in decision making at all 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets and Eastern Europe aren't waiting for the United deal to go through 
before taking lessons from America's rapidly growing experience with employee 
ownership, says Corey Rosen, executive secretary of the Oakland-based National 
Center for Employee Ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Some initial exchange visits by worker-ownership advocates have already been 
made between those countries and the United States. Legislation to encourage 
the practice is being drafted in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Hungary, Yugoslavia and East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But there are serious obstacles that must be overcome if those countries are 
going to have a significant amount of worker ownership as they make the 
historic transition to more market-oriented economies. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, they urgently need foreign investment capital that will not be 
easily obtained under any circumstances, and will be even harder to get for 
economically troubled companies owned by workers, says Rutgers Professor Joseph 
Blasi, author of "Employee Ownership: Revolution or Ripoff?" 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Blasi, who has met with officials of some Eastern European 
nations, is convinced that workers in most of those countries will have at 
least a "significant minority stake in their companies." 
</P>
<P>
The employee buyout at United Airlines demonstrates the difficulty of getting 
investors to put money even into a financially healthy worker-owned company in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly looks like a good deal. United's employees expect to buy it for 
$4.36 billion, far less than the $6.7 billion the pilots said they were ready 
to pay for it last year but couldn't because they failed to get the financing 
and because of bitter arguments between the unions involved. 
</P>
<P>
Those arguments are mostly resolved and the new buyout plan would give 
employees 100% ownership, which means the government can provide tax advantages 
worth more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the workers will take an initial pay cut of about 4%, and, after 
regaining that loss next year, their wages will be frozen for the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The wage freeze and work-rule changes are worth an estimated $2 billion. In 
other words, to buy United, the workers, through their unions, are going to 
need about $1.3 billion from investors. 
</P>
<P>
That's a real bargain, according to the employees' financial advisers and 
others involved in the buyout, including Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
But, bargain or not, there was limited interest from investors until the unions 
got former Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald to lead the buyout and 
serve as chairman and chief executive officer if it goes through, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
The UAL buyout might be a model, but the Soviets and the Eastern Europeans will 
probably be a bit bewildered by it. They may think it bizarre that, to make the 
buyout possible, United's 71,000 workers needed just one key person -- 
Greenwald. 
</P>
<P>
And while all of those employees will have to freeze their wages for four years 
and promise not to strike, Greenwald will get $1.1 million a year plus millions 
more in stock options and a $5-million bonus just for agreeing to be their 
leader. Even if the deal falls through, he reportedly will walk away with $9 
million. True, he has never run an airline before, but he knows finances, and 
that's what counts to investors. 
</P>
<P>
John Peterpaul, vice president of the International Assn. of Machinists, who 
helped put the deal together, says that while he is still not an enthusiastic 
supporter of worker-owned companies, "things were so messed up at United, we 
had no choice except to try and buy it, and so with a relatively small 
investment we are protecting our jobs and ought to be able to make United a 
very successful airline." 
</P>
<P>
However, while investors may be putting all their hopes on Greenwald, in the 
real world it is the workers -- with their skills and with key roles in 
decision making -- who can make the company succeed and let it serve as a role 
model for the Soviets and the Eastern Europeans.

BIDWELL JOINS EXODUS OF CHRYSLER OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outspoken Chrysler Corp. executive Bennett Bidwell ended months of speculation 
about his early retirement and joined the executives leaving the No. 3 auto 
maker Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of the company's most colorful executive next to Chairman Lee A. 
Iacocca was the fourth announced in the past six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwell is chairman of Chrysler Motors, in charge of car- and truck-making 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to put all this speculation to rest and let the media go back to 
covering some of the other important stories of our day such as perestroika, 
democracy in Eastern Europe and the search for a cure to AIDS," Bidwell said. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation is effective Jan. 1. Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said it was 
too soon to name Bidwell's successor. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has lost to resignations its vice chairman, Gerald Greenwald, and vice 
president for international operations, Michael Hammes. Treasurer Frederick 
Zuckerman has said he plans to leave this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald left Chrysler on May 30 to head a union bid to buy UAL Corp. for 
$4.54 billion, and Hammes left earlier to head Black &amp; Decker's tool-making 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Because of those departures and Bidwell's expected early retirement at age 63, 
Iacocca said late last week that he would stay on past Dec. 8, 1991, when his 
four-year contract was to expire. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwell reportedly had sought a reduction in his workload but because of 
problems at the auto maker didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in reasonably good health," Bidwell said, "but it's time to decelerate a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
He held out the possibility that he would stick around past the end of the year 
"if the environment were to change significantly and I were really needed."

AMERICAN TO HEAD NISSAN'S MARKETING OPERATIONS IN U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOS: THE JAPANESE FIRM SAYS THE APPOINTMENT IS PART OF ITS STRATEGY TO BE A 
'FULLY LOCALIZED, CUSTOMER-ORIENTED COMPANY.' 
</P>

<P>
Nissan on Monday named an American to head its U.S. sales and marketing 
operations -- a first among major Japanese auto makers, company officials 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas D. Mignanelli will become president and chief executive of Nissan Motor 
Corp. in U.S.A. on July 1, replacing Kazutoshi Hagiwara, who will return to the 
Tokyo-based parent company, Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. executives working for Japanese corporations have complained that 
they are given little authority or opportunity for advancement. But analysts 
say Japanese companies eventually will come to rely more on U.S. employees to 
be able to respond more quickly to the changeable tastes of U.S. consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mignanelli's appointment is in keeping with our strategy to become a fully 
localized, customer-oriented company in America," said Yoshikazu Hanawa, 
president of Nissan North America, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary that 
coordinates all of the car maker's U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Mignanelli, who came to Nissan three years ago after an 18-year 
stint with Ford Motor Co., will oversee the marketing and sales of all Nissan 
and Infiniti automobiles and trucks in the United States. Mignanelli, who is 
now executive vice president of operations, will report to Hanawa, who visits 
Los Angeles frequently but is based in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most Americanized Japanese companies," Mignanelli said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says in Japanese companies you don't progress, you don't do this, 
you don't do that," he said. "Well, I'm sitting here feeling pretty good about 
progression in the last three years." 
</P>
<P>
In response to earlier reports that American employees at Nissan were monitored 
by Japanese executives who provided the sole link with Tokyo, Mignanelli said 
Monday, "I don't have to clear my phone calls to Japan." 
</P>
<P>
An American also heads Nissan's other large U.S. subsidiary, Nissan Motor 
Manufacturing Corp. in Smyrna, Tenn. A British native is president of the 
Japanese firm's manufacturing subsidiary in Britain, and an Australian heads 
the Nissan subsidiary there. 
</P>
<P>
"Having worked with Japanese car companies for 23 years . . . I think it is a 
major step on their part to give (Mignanelli) this responsibility," said J. 
Dave Power, president of J. D. Power Associates, an Agoura Hills automotive 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Mike Kobayashi of Paine Webber, the New York brokerage, said Nissan 
needs "a guy who can read the market very well, very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "I think it would be an illusion to think that a U.S. guy 
would run all of Nissan's U.S. operations. It's still a subsidiary of a 
Japanese corporation . . . so it's logical for it to be run by a Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
A University of Michigan survey of U.S. managers at Japanese corporations last 
year found that many are excluded from decision-making inside their firms and 
have trouble advancing. 
</P>
<P>
But Vladimir Pucik, an associate business professor who co-wrote the study, 
said the problem is one of know-how on the part of Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a conspiracy to keep Americans out," said Pucik, who is on a 
research leave in Japan. "They do promote them to positions of responsibility, 
but there is a dilemma of how to integrate the two operations (in Japan and the 
United States). That's more difficult than finding capable Americans and 
promoting them." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Nissan shows a lot of courage by being able to take the risk," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A much smaller Japanese car maker, American Isuzu Motors, recently appointed an 
American to the position of chairman.

GAS COULD DROP 10 CENTS A GALLON BY MID-SUMMER

Gasoline prices may fall as much as 10 cents a gallon by the end of July as 
refiners fill their supply tanks with cheaper crude oil, oil industry analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
But the nation's gas station dealers are cautious about the price forecasts, 
saying refiners may choose not to pass on their lower crude costs to consumers 
in the form of cheaper gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of unleaded gasoline at self-service stations was $1.06 a 
gallon in early June, according to Computer Petroleum Corp., which surveys 
8,000 stations weekly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (a drop of) 10 cents, starting to show up in the end of July, is 
absolutely a reasonable thing," said John Dosher, vice president of Pace 
Consultants Inc. in Houston.

MANUFACTURERS' FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT DIPS 5%

Manufacturers' after-tax profit totaled $28.6 billion in the first quarter of 
the year, down 4.9% or $1.5 billion from the final quarter of 1989, the 
Commerce Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After-tax profit averaged 4.2 cents per dollar of sales in the first three 
months of the year, a decline of 0.2 cents from the previous three months, the 
department's Census Bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen profits bear much of the brunt of the economic slowdown," said Lynn 
Reaser, senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp. "Profits were weak 
through much of last year and that softness has continued." 
</P>
<P>
But Reaser added: "I think we'll see some improvement in the latter part of the 
year. Manufacturers have pared down their payrolls. They have become very lean 
as companies attempt to protect their profit margins." 
</P>
<P>
Sales in January, February and March totaled $683.5 billion, a gain of 0.4% or 
$2.9 billion from October, November and December, the department said. The 
figures were adjusted to reflect seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
Food and printing businesses contributed to a significant decline in 
first-quarter profits for the makers of non-durable goods.

FROHNMAYER'S NEA TENURE IN QUESTION; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: SOME HOUSE REPUBLICANS SAY HIS FAILURE TO DEAL WITH THE ENDOWMENT'S 
PROBLEMS EFFECTIVELY HAS COMPROMISED HIS LEADERSHIP. 
</P>

<P>
A key Republican congressman is to meet with National Endowment for the Arts 
Chairman John E. Frohnmayer today to discuss content control of artworks funded 
by the NEA, amid indications that the arts agency's political crisis may be 
leading to calls for Frohnmayer's departure. 
</P>
<P>
There was no public outpouring of sentiment on Monday advocating Frohnmayer's 
removal from the post, which he assumed only last October. However, 
congressional sources said there appeared to be growing fear among House 
Republicans that the chairman's inability to contain a series of administrative 
problems within the NEA and to resolve its ongoing political difficulties may 
be starting to take their toll. 
</P>
<P>
At the arts endowment, meanwhile, Frohnmayer made a series of internal 
administrative moves apparently designed to blunt the effects of a months-long 
inability to fill three top jobs in the endowment administration and to quickly 
counteract the ouster last week of Alvin S. Felzenberg, the NEA's No. 2 
administrator since just Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduling of today's meeting was disclosed by Rep. Paul Henry (R-Mich.), an 
influential member of the House subcommittee that is grappling with an attempt 
to renew the NEA's legislative mandate. The situation was plunged into 
uncertainty last week when the White House floated an ambiguous option plan in 
which the legislative reauthorization would be for one year or three years -- 
not the five-year term still officially under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Henry has been a key member of the subcommittee because he has vigorously 
attacked attempts by conservatives to abolish the NEA. Henry has also insisted 
that Frohnmayer and NEA allies accept changes in the endowment's enabling law 
to spell out kinds of art that are appropriate for federal support. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Monday, Henry -- for the first time -- linked the 
continued impasse over what he characterized as appropriate regulatory language 
to Frohnmayer's continuing tenure in office. Henry said he was concerned that 
if the NEA chairman has not joined in a Republican initiative to draft NEA art 
content-control language by the end of the week, the beleaguered NEA chairman 
will be greeted with a series of public calls for his ouster by House 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"I will say that, every day that the chairman refuses to take a forthright 
stand on the distinction between censorship and public sponsorship (of art), he 
is hurting the cause of the NEA rather than assisting it," said Henry of 
Frohnmayer's heretofore consistent refusal to endorse language restricting the 
content of NEA-funded art. Frohnmayer has campaigned against repetition of a 
successful congressional effort last year to attach language banning funding 
obscene work that does not meet high standards of artistic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that if we go through this week and there is no movement on his 
part," said Henry of Frohnmayer, "then there will be some likelihood that 
people will be inclined to give public voice to their growing frustrations" 
with calls for Frohnmayer's replacement. "I might be one of them," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
A White House spokeswoman said President Bush continues to have high regard for 
Frohnmayer and that the NEA chief's job was not in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Henry declined to identify other likely participants in any campaign to 
displace Frohnmayer, but congressional sources said Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio) 
has been increasingly impatient with the situation, and concerned with the 
political damage being inflicted by conservative NEA opponents on House 
Republicans who must run for reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
Regula said he was not part of any movement to depose Frohnmayer at the moment. 
But, he said, the NEA chairman could soon find his tenure threatened if the 
situation remains out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Other House Republicans were more supportive. "Frohnmayer is not the problem. 
Congress is the problem," said Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa), a former television 
and stage actor. "The artistry of some of the demagoguery (in Congress over the 
NEA issue) is so good they ought to apply to the NEA for funding themselves." 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody's very nervous about the situation," said a top aide to a 
liberal Democratic congressman identified as a key NEA supporter. "Right now, 
if Frohnmayer goes down, at least he goes down fighting the good fight. It has 
certainly turned out that this appointment was no plum." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer did not return calls seeking his comments on the meeting with Henry 
or other aspects of the situation, but the NEA confirmed he has a series of 
meetings with congressmen today. 
</P>
<P>
Felzenberg is technically still an NEA employee as he awaits a White House move 
to place him in another federal agency. But the clash between the two men has 
begun to take a toll on internal morale within the arts agency. The two have 
been estranged in a clash of professional style and priorities for the 
endowment. NEA sources have said they seldom communicated fully and seldom even 
spoke. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, endowment sources confirmed that Frohnmayer had made four personnel 
moves in the last few days, apparently an attempt to stabilize the endowment's 
increasingly difficult internal dynamics. He named Selina Ottum, currently the 
NEA's deputy chairman for public partnership, to take over almost all of 
Felzenberg's responsibilities as senior deputy chairman of the NEA. Ottum and 
Frohnmayer have a long-time association dating to Portland, Ore., where they 
both were active in arts causes. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Frohnmayer displaced Ana Steele, a 25-year veteran of the 
arts agency who had been acting deputy chairman for programs and replaced her 
-- also on an acting basis -- with Randy McAusland, now director of the NEA's 
design arts program. Frohnmayer also hired David O'Fallon, a University of 
Minnesota arts administration expert, as the NEA's new director of 
arts-in-education. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Frohnmayer has held as many as a dozen meetings with the NEA's 
14 program directors, demanding that they produce a plan to completely 
restructure the agency. Over the weekend and Monday morning, NEA sources said 
the restructuring in question appeared to be taking the form of an arts 
endowment that would have just four major program elements -- down from about 
15 now. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer has told the program directors the restructuring is essential to the 
NEA's political survival. Last week, Frohnmayer reportedly told the officials 
he was under pressure to deliver a detailed restructuring plan to the White 
House. The pressures are thought to emanate from the growing impatience of some 
administration officials with the longevity and heated nature of the 
14-month-old NEA crisis.

ESCONDIDO UNIFIED VOTES TODAY ON PEACEMAKER 
</P>

<BYLINE>

The Escondido Unified High School board, in a special meeting today, will vote 
on the contract of a new superintendent to replace John Cooper, whom the school 
board asked to resign at the end of last year because of displeasure with his 
management style. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Gawronski, now the superintendent at West Covina Unified School District, 
was chosen for her "open and candid" management style, said Lee Newcomer, 
consultant to the board during the two-month search. 
</P>
<P>
The board had narrowed a field of six candidates to three before deciding on 
48-year-old Gawronski, whom Newcomer described as a peacemaker and "extremely 
skillful at participatory management." 
</P>
<P>
Gawronski succeeds Cooper, who was asked to step down because of the "turmoil 
in the district" that included criticism from employees concerning personnel 
matters, school board president Bruce Studebaker said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomer said the board felt that conflict at the board level and at the 
central office required a strong leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The board recognized that they need somebody to pull the board together and 
pull the central office together. They wanted someone who was strong enough to 
do that, somebody who knew how to work with and through people," Newcomer said. 
</P>
<P>
The previous administration suffered from poor and ineffective communication, 
and a lack of teamwork, Newcomer said. 
</P>
<P>
Gawronski, whose contract would begin July 16 with a yet undetermined salary, 
will leave her post in West Covina where she inherited a $3.3-million deficit 
three years ago and brought the district back to solvency, Newcomer and 
Studebaker said. 
</P>
<P>
In order to do so, however, Gawronski closed down one of the district's two 
high schools, two junior highs and an elementary school. She was also forced to 
lay off about 50 faculty and staff members, a move that sparked protest among 
the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been through every roadblock, every stumbling block a superintendent can 
have," Studebaker said, noting that Gawronski will not be officially hired 
until the contract is signed, which is planned for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been through the mill in West Covina. The district went bankrupt, and 
she brought it back to financial health," Studebaker said. "She got good marks 
from everybody up there." 
</P>
<P>
"The people that were really involved in the school closures are now her 
supporters," Newcomer said. 
</P>
<P>
Gawronski, who could not be reached for comment, had spent four years as 
assistant superintendent at the Walnut Valley Unified School District in 
Walnut.

COLLEGE TRUSTEES WIN CONTROL OF $8-MILLION FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial foundation will hand over control of an $8-million endowment to 
San Diego Community College trustees under terms of a tentative settlement 
reached Monday in a long-running dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the foundation will pay $800,000 into the trust over a two-year 
period, will close a $213,000 reserve account and turn the money over to the 
college district and will agree to put out for public bid all future contracts 
it desires with the district in excess of $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the foundation -- known until last January as the San Diego 
Community College District Foundation -- will sever all control over the 
endowment. The trust was established as a 25-year formal trust in 1986 after 
money was accumulated over several years by the foundation, originally set up 
in 1976 as a private nonprofit corporation under the California Corporations 
Code. 
</P>
<P>
If it shapes up as expected during a Superior Court public hearing June 29, the 
agreement will bring to a close a festering legal battle over whether the 
foundation unlawfully acted in a way to harm the college district. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement includes language stating that all sides in the dispute acted in 
what they believed was good faith and in the best interests of the community 
college district, which includes 100,000 students at Mesa, Miramar and City 
colleges as well at 10 adult education centers. Half the endowment interest 
each year is given to the community college district -- $1.03 million during 
the past four years -- while the other 50% has gone to the foundation for 
reinvestment or for foundation expenses. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit alleging unlawful action was filed in May, 1988, by several community 
</P>
<P>
college professors against members of the district board of trustees, against 
former district Chancellor Garland Peed and against the foundation itself. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs alleged that the foundation illegally used revenue belonging to 
the district, that it illegally spent money on educational projects in 
competition with courses taught by district professors, that it held secret 
meetings in violation of state law, and that it made cash payments to 
politicians as part of illegal lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
As chancellor, Peed in 1976 formed the foundation to raise money to support 
college and continuing-education programs. In the early 1980s, the funds began 
accumulating in significant amounts under an arrangement under which it 
provided services for educational programs that the district contracted for at 
military bases around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Community college faculty members argued that the arrangement put the 
foundation in competition with the district by doing its own hiring for those 
educational programs and by receiving funds that should have gone to the 
district. The arrangement sowed distrust among the faculty, who feared that the 
foundation would grow into a full-fledged educational enterprise that could 
threaten district growth, a notion disputed by Peed and the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty further objected to honorariums paid to politicians and alleged the 
expenditures to be political-influence payments. Until 1987, the five 
foundation directors were appointed by the board of trustees but otherwise 
acted independently. For the past three years, the board of trustees has had no 
control over the foundation board. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached Monday, the foundation directors agree to resign as 
overseers of the endowment trust. The community college board of trustees will 
appoint, at a public meeting, a new overseer and an advisory board to 
administer the investments. 
</P>
<P>
The board of trustees will set up a new foundation and appoint its five 
members. The new foundation will decide how to spend the interest that accrues 
annually. The existing foundation now calls itself the San Diego Foundation for 
Educational Achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The former foundation will pay $500,000 to the trust on June 30 and an 
additional $300,000 on June 30, 1991. The community college district has agreed 
to pay the legal costs of the plaintiffs represented by attorney Patricia 
Meyer. San Diego County Deputy County Counsel Andrew Freeman estimated those 
costs Monday at $280,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone (on the faculty side) will be happy, but the hearing on June 
29 is to make sure everyone has a chance to know the terms," Meyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said the settlement represents a reasonable compromise for all parties, 
and Peter Benzian, attorney for the foundation, said it confirms the 
foundation's contention that it always acted for the long-term benefit of the 
district by setting up the endowment.

SCHOOL TO TEACH KINDERGARTNERS ONLY IN SPANISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Paula elementary school officials are busily planning the county's first 
Spanish language "immersion" program for a group of kindergarten children who 
will be instructed primarily in Spanish for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next September, the kindergarten class at Glen City School will be 
taught almost exclusively in Spanish. Students will get only 25 minutes each 
day of English instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The class, which will include reading, math, social science and science 
instruction, differs from other bilingual programs where the aim is to help 
students communicate in English. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the English-speakers in the Santa Paula school will be encouraged to 
become fluent in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Within five years, the program will be expanded from kindergarten to fifth 
grade, with more English instruction, Assistant Supt. Bonnie Bruington said. By 
the time students reach fifth grade, instruction will be evenly divided between 
the two languages. 
</P>
<P>
The first class of 30 Santa Paula kindergartners will be evenly split between 
English and Spanish speakers, Glen City Principal Bonnie Switack said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way a child who knows English well is going to forget his English," 
Switack said. On the other hand, "if you want them to learn more English, make 
them more literate, make them more likely to read, and the English will take 
care of itself," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Glen City School is one of three magnet schools in the district that offers 
special academic programs as part of efforts to achieve more racially balanced 
schools. The other two magnet schools are Bidell and Barbara Webster elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of the 500 students at Glen City School have limited skills in 
English, and about half come from Latino families, Switack said. 
</P>
<P>
After Fillmore, Santa Paula has the highest proportion of students who come 
from Latino families, said Cliff Rodrigues, bilingual education coordinator for 
the Ventura County superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,200 students who attend Santa Paula elementary schools, about 70% are 
from Latino families. 
</P>
<P>
While other programs emphasize English in bilingual classes, Santa Paula is 
unusual in giving equal treatment to both languages, Rodrigues noted. Similar 
programs are being tried elsewhere in San Diego and Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Spanish has not been a well-accepted language. It's the language of poor 
countries," Rodrigues said. "They're giving a different kind of prestige, and I 
think that's super." 
</P>
<P>
Glen City teacher Avelina Ramirez will begin teaching the first class of 
kindergartners even before the first day of school. She plans to explain the 
program to parents and kindergartners enrolled in the class during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Students will be organized in small groups with equal numbers of bilingual, 
English-only and Spanish-only speakers. Despite the emphasis on Spanish, 
students will not be ignored if they ask questions in English, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Santa Paula who gradually lost her Spanish-language abilities while 
attending Santa Paula schools, Ramirez said she will draw from her own early 
memories communicating in another language. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up at a time when Spanish was forbidden in the schools," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
But today, Spanish "is so important especially living here in Southern 
California where the Latino population is just growing," she added. "A child 
that has two languages is a lot more intelligent than a person who knows one."

COUNTY BRACES FOR TENSE, PACKED LANDFILL HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Never before, San Diego County planning officials say, have they been bombarded 
with such an outpouring of opposition to a single proposal, and today that 
proposal will surface at a public hearing in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Where should North County's garbage be dumped? 
</P>
<P>
The county has identified three potential landfill sites, and the Planning 
Commission today will meet at 9 a.m. for what is expected to be an all-day 
marathon session -- that will most likely spill over into Friday -- to discuss 
the pros and cons of each. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is bound to hear more cons than pros. About 1,400 separate 
letters have been received by the county, some asking one or two questions and 
others posing 100 or more questions about the landfill site-selection process. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been with the county for 15 years, and neither I nor people I've talked 
to can think of any (public reaction) even approaching this," said Jon Rollin, 
a program coordinator for the county Department of Public Works' solid waste 
division. 
</P>
<P>
The county staff has recommended that all three proposed landfill sites be 
adopted by the county to help ensure a place to dump garbage for the next 50 
years or so. 
</P>
<P>
The county's existing North County landfill, in San Marcos, is expected to be 
filled next year, and, even if it is expanded, it will fill up by the end of 
the decade, planners estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sites are: 
</P>
<P>
* A 416-acre site along Aspen Road in Fallbrook that would take about 15 years' 
worth of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
* A 238-acre site in Gregory Canyon, along California 76 just east of 
Interstate 15 in the Pauma Valley, that could accommodate 14 years' of trash. 
</P>
<P>
* A 772-acre site at Blue Canyon northwest of Warner Springs, near California 
79, that would accommodate trash for about 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have pounded the county with arguments opposing each site -- and still 
more, new arguments are expected to be heard today when the Planning Commission 
meets in a community hall at St. Peter's Catholic Church, 450 S. Stage Coach 
Lane, in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Among the opponents will be John Hanson, a licensed engineering geologist who 
lives near the Fallbrook site and will argue that the county will be asking for 
big trouble if it puts garbage there. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson said a review of seismic studies suggests that an earthquake measuring 
7.0 on the Richter scale would have the end result of collapsing the Fallbrook 
trash site, which he likens more to a mountain of garbage than a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Not only would the man-made embankments surrounding the trash fill give way in 
such an earthquake, he said, but the landfill's bottom clay liner would 
fracture. In that event, he contends, the toxins within the landfill would 
leach into the region's ground water, contaminating not only much of 
Fallbrook's well water but that of neighboring Camp Pendleton, which relies 
exclusively on the nearby Santa Margarita River ground-water basin. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps, along with other federal and state agencies, have gone on 
record as opposing the Fallbrook site. 
</P>
<P>
"The failure (of the clay liner) would be the most catastrophic of events and 
have the worse implications for the environment," said Hanson, who said he 
based his analysis on the same figures and computer modeling as was relied upon 
by the county itself in studying the site. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you fix something like that, when it's under several hundred feet of 
garbage?" he asked rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Tinker, general manager of the Fallbrook Public Utilities District, said 
the county staff's recommendation to adopt any of the three sites -- let alone 
all of them -- "is appalling." 
</P>
<P>
Each landfill could contaminate ground-water basins, thereby posing a risk that 
shouldn't be accepted by the county no matter how minimal, Tinker contends. 
</P>
<P>
"The county has to wake up to the fact that we can't accept any risks, no 
matter how small, to any of our water resources. But we seem to be dealing with 
a certain segment of the county government that isn't showing any concern about 
those other issues and are just thinking about their own little piece of the 
action," Tinker complained. 
</P>
<P>
"They're ignoring the other issues and will pass the buck onto the Planning 
Commission and ultimately the Board of Supervisors, and is putting them between 
a rock and a hard place. They're going to force this into a political 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of the Planning Commission decision on where a landfill 
should be developed, its choice will go before the County Board of Supervisors 
no earlier than next month. Already, the San Diego Convention Center has been 
reserved for the meeting because of the turnout expected.

BINGO SPELLS PRAISE FOR SYCUAN INDIANS FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BONNA M. DE LA CRUZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sycuan band of Mission Indians, in its sixth year of operating a profitable 
bingo hall, got a pat on the back Monday for its financial stability when the 
federal government's assistant secretary for Indian affairs visited the 
reservation east of El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
"We often talk about tribal self-determination, Indian self-determination, and 
I think this is probably one of the places where that is truly taking place. I 
wanted to personally come out to take a look at it," said Eddie Brown, who is 
in charge of Indian affairs for the U.S. Department of the Interior. The 
Sycuans no longer rely on federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
The Sycuan Reservation, one of 18 American Indian reservations in Southern 
California, operates a gaming center offering high-stakes bingo and poker seven 
days a week, bringing in more than $20 million in revenues a year. Gaming on 
the country's Indian reservations was a $400-million business last year, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About $2 million of the gaming profits go directly back to the Sycuans each 
year, said Jim Trant, tribal business manager. With that money, the Sycuans 
became self-sufficient, improving health care with a modern health clinic, 
providing scholarships for Sycuan youth, maintaining fire and police 
departments, operating a 24-hour ambulance service and building 29 
Spanish-style homes. 
</P>
<P>
"What's significant here is we're not talking about federal dollars. These are 
dollars generated by the community through their economic ventures, such as 
bingo," Brown said. He said only tribal health services receive minimal federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
The Sycuan tribe plans to open a $3-million gaming center extension in 
mid-August. The casino will employ more than 800 people, general manager Gerald 
Winters said, possibly making it the largest employer in East County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impressive that a tribe such as this one has taken the funds, put them 
back into the community and are looking at broader things," Brown said. 
"They're looking at how they can improve education, looking at other things for 
the elderly, looking at other needs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown also heard grievances from tribal leaders of about 15 other 
reservations who told him of problems with local law enforcement officials, 
antiquated irrigation systems and inequitable funding, during a session of the 
Southern California Tribal Chairmen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Brown visited reservations in central and northern California on Monday. It was 
his first trip to the state since he took office less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sycuan gaming center ran into trouble with law enforcement 
officials when it offered three bingo games in 1984 that were later ruled 
illegal, it has been operating without interruption since opening in November 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Barona Reservation, near Lakeside, and Rincon Reservation, northeast of 
Escondido, also offered high-stakes bingo and poker in the early 1980s. Both

NAVY IN SAN DIEGO TO PLAY HOST TO 3 SOVIET WARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a display of glasnost and good will, three Soviet warships will dock at San 
Diego Naval Station July 31 for an unprecedented five-day visit to the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The visit of Soviet conventionally powered ships, laden with several hundred 
sailors, represents the second round of a naval exchange agreement that 
officials hope will further warm relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary purpose of the visit is to provide navy-to-navy interaction, which 
will result in increased professional understanding and cultural awareness," 
according to a recently issued Navy document. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials, who declined to discuss the visit until it is officially 
announced Wednesday, said they hope the Soviets will better understand the 
"professionalism, pride, and quality of life" of the Navy and Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
Though the visit has been planned for months, U.S. and Soviet officials had 
decided to postpone announcements until after the recent summit talks between 
presidents George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev, "because of the upheaval in the 
Soviet Union," a Navy official said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Soviet destroyers, the General Vinogradov and Sovremenny, and the support 
tanker Argun will probably be the ships selected to sail the roughly 6,000-mile 
voyage. Soviet officials, however, have changed the ship selection several 
times and may do so again, Navy officials caution. A group of 145 Soviets, 
including officials, band members, a soccer and volleyball team, and a song and 
dance troupe will accompany the sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Once the ships reach shore, the visitors and hosts will offer each other 
snapshots of their homeland cultures. The Soviets are prepared to play ball and 
music, as well as sing and dance. And Navy officials hope to take their guests 
to Sea World, the zoo and Camp Pendleton for a barbecue and rodeo. The 
itinerary has not been finished, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of an exchange program established by Adm. William Crowe, 
former chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Marshal Sergie 
Akhromeyev, former Soviet chief of staff. Last July, the Soviet navy visited a 
U.S. naval base in Norfolk, Va. The following month, the U.S. Navy visited 
Sevastopol in the Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets are expected to reciprocate San Diego's hospitality in September 
when three U.S. Navy ships visit Vladivostok in the Soviet Far East. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Adm. Charles Larson will host 
his Soviet guests. And his Soviet counterpart, Adm. G.A. Khuatov, commander of 
the Soviet Pacific Fleet, is expected to head the flotilla of three vessels as 
they sail. 
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. Navy vessels have also been selected to be host ships. Those ships 
will be the guided missile cruiser Leahy, the destroyer Merrill, and the guided 
missile frigate McClusky. Soviet sailors will be permitted aboard the vessels, 
and U.S. sailors can board those of their guests. 
</P>
<P>
Local political activists welcomed the visit, saying such exchanges could only 
improve relations between the two superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
"The exchange that we can promote between the two countries, at any level, is 
wonderful," said Theresa Picado, a spokeswoman for Mothers Embracing Nuclear 
Disarmament. "We have to adopt a policy of international goodwill and 
cooperation -- we don't have a choice anymore if we are going to preserve the 
planet." 
</P>
<P>
Still others see the visit as a yardstick to measure the progress in the 
warming relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the level of fear there has been in the past and the general Cold War 
mentality, having ships visit us demonstrates how the situation has changed," 
said Carol Jahnkow, director of the Peace Resource Center, an educational 
group. "A year ago, people might have expressed more concern. This shows how 
far we've come."

<P>
OFFICIALS SEEK FAIR RENT FOR POST OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ojai officials are preparing to ask their senators, congressmen and the U.S. 
postmaster general to assure that the U.S. Postal Service will pay fair-market 
rent for its office in downtown Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Andrew Belknap said he fears that the Postal Service has proposed 
far lower rent than is fair over the next 11 years as a ploy to be able to move 
the main post office from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Fay, president of the Ojai Civic Assn., which owns the bell-towered 
building that houses the post office, says the fixed-rate offer of $56,600 a 
year until 2002 is "unfair and one-sided." 
</P>
<P>
Fay and Belknap have prepared a letter protesting the proposed contract, 
calculating that the fixed rent would fall far short of the pace of inflation, 
giving the Postal Service an unfair windfall of $180,000 over the next 11 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap is asking Ojai Mayor Nina Shelley to sign the letter with the City 
Council's approval today. Copies will be sent to Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
and Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), and Reps. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) and 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
The dispute dates back to 1986 when the Postal Service informed the association 
that it was planning to build a larger post office on the west side of town. 
Residents protested the move, circulating petitions and printing up T-shirts 
pleading, "Save Our Post Office." 
</P>
<P>
With help from Lagomarsino and Gallegly, the association received the Postal 
Service's promise that it would keep the main branch downtown and build an 
annex elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials signed an agreement with the association in 1988 to enter into 
a long-term lease based on the building's fair-market value. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials believe their current offer of fixed rent meets that 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Civic Assn. finds this explanation unconvincing, and I share their 
skepticism," Belknap wrote to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be an attempt to present a lease so one-sided that the Ojai Civic 
Assn. will not sign it, thus freeing the facilities branch to resurrect their 
plan to build a completely new facility." THIA BELL

WOMAN CHARGED IN KIDNAP HOAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who told Oxnard police Friday that her baby had been kidnaped was 
charged Monday with filing a false report after her story turned out to be a 
hoax, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Robert Kelley gave this account: 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Espinoza, 26, called police Friday night to report that her 7-month-old 
daughter, Cynthia, had been abducted. 
</P>
<P>
Espinoza said she had been at the county welfare office on Vanguard Drive that 
afternoon when she noticed the child was missing. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrol officers burned up a whole lot of investigating time checking various 
locations and addresses where the child might be, where the father might be, 
various welfare people," Kelley said. "Later a detective was called out and 
spent more time investigating." 
</P>
<P>
Espinoza's estranged husband denied any knowledge of the infant's whereabouts, 
Kelley said. On Monday, Kelley said, investigators determined that Cynthia was 
safe with a friend of the mother, and that Espinoza had concocted the story to 
hurt her husband. Espinoza, who has moved from an Oxnard motel to an address on 
Ramona Street in Ventura, was charged with filing a false police report, a 
misdemeanor offense. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley said police did not issue a public appeal for help because "her story 
stunk from the onset." Police still had to conduct an investigation, the cost 
of which Kelley estimated at several thousand dollars. GARY GORMAN

TEACHER SELECTED FOR NASA PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAJA RADEVICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catharine Bly said she was always an adventurous person, eager to travel and 
explore. She's already been to many places on earth, but these days she has her 
sights set on outer space. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old bilingual teacher at E.P. Foster Elementary School in Ventura, 
was recently selected to participate in the NASA Education Workshop for 
Elementary Science Teachers. Next month, she will spend two weeks at the 
Stennis Space Center in Mississippi to gain in-depth knowledge of aerospace 
education. 
</P>
<P>
A devoted fan of the science-fiction television series Star Trek, Bly's dream 
is to someday travel in space. "And I definitely think that that will happen," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said her fascination with space travel began with the 1969 moon landing. 
But it wasn't until NASA launched a nationwide search for a teacher to be the 
first civilian passenger aboard the space shuttle that her interests took 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I took one of the applications, but I just didn't have enough of the 
qualifications, so I never filled it out," Bly said. "Since then, I've been 
working to learn more about aerospace and math and science -- I'll be ready 
next time." 
</P>
<P>
Among her new list of accomplishments, Bly holds credentials to keep and show 
moon rocks at the school. In addition, she has attended shuttle landing 
conferences, leads the Young Astronauts Club after school and is a member of 
the California Assn. for Aerospace Education. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I started learning about what's in -- or rather what's not -- in space, 
I wasn't very environmentally concerned," Bly said. "But the more I learn about 
space and how unique and special our planet is, the more I see how important it 
is to preserve it." MAJA RADEVICH

COUNCIL MAY SEEK ANTI-DRUG GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council today will consider applying for a $220,000 grant from 
the U.S. Department of Justice to establish a two-person "street level" drug 
enforcement team. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the city would be asked to contribute $107,200 to the total 
project cost of $354,180. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $26,980 would come from asset forfeitures confiscated in police 
drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Justice's Narcotics Control Discretionary Grant Program 
provides such grants for a one-year period to help local agencies prosecute 
drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Although local matching funds are not required, a demonstration of commitment 
from local agencies -- in the form of monetary contributions -- may be a 
determining factor for federal officials deciding who will get the grants, 
according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
The two-person drug enforcement team, which would include a demand reduction 
officer and a case management clerk, would work specifically on reducing the 
demand for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The demand reduction officer would collect and distribute information from 
other narcotic enforcement teams and work with business owners to develop drug 
policies in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The case management clerk would work with the demand reduction officer to 
establish and maintain a tracking and filing system for repeat offenders. HUGO

<P>
The fatal shooting April 8 of a suspected thief by a San Diego police officer 
has been ruled justifiable by Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin L. Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Derek Diaz shot auto-theft suspect Gregory J. Markley through the chest 
during an arrest after Markley ignored Diaz's commands to stop reaching toward 
his belt, according to Miller's report dated June 5 and released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Diaz had a 6-inch knife and a set of bolt cutters at the time of the 
arrest, San Diego Police Department spokesman David Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was reasonable for officer Diaz to believe the rubber handles of the bolt 
cutters were pistol grips and to react defensively when Markley reached for 
them," Miller's report stated.

<P>
San Diego police have arrested a 16-year-old Clairemont boy in connection with 
a fatal shooting during an attempted robbery last week in a motel parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The juvenile's name has not been released because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
Police have identified Charles Barkar, 18, of Clairemont, as one of two men who 
attempted to rob Richard Thompson, 59, of Calexico, last Wednesday night at the 
Clairemont Motel 6. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson fatally shot Barkar, and the juvenile fled on foot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, the juvenile, who was arrested Sunday night, can be 
charged with murder because he committed a felony that resulted in a death, a 
Police Department spokesman said.

PRO AND CON ON HOPE LAND SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people and organizations have said that they support the land exchange 
arranged by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. However, they say that 
doesn't necessarily mean they support the development plans at Jordan Ranch for 
750 estate homes and a PGA tournament-style golf course, all adjacent to 
national parkland at Cheeseboro Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Do not miss the point: The only reason for the swap is to obtain land for a 
road that will open up to growth the developers' landlocked property. 
Advocating the swap is promoting development. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the developers have more than these 750 homes and golf course on 
their drawing boards. The extension of Thousand Oaks Boulevard from Agoura 
Hills to Calabasas and the extension of Victory Boulevard from the San Fernando 
Valley to Malibu Canyon Road, with related urban development, are next.

The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Bob Hope have just reached an

Giving 59 acres in exchange for 5,700 acres of pristine land, wildlife

James A. Todd, the Alabama company's president and chief executive officer,

Dial the number in Southern California and your call is taken by Pacific Bell 
or GTE and handed over to a long-distance telephone company, which sends it to 
a telecommunications complex in Las Vegas that is the home of Audio 
Communications Inc., the company that produces Canseco's program. 
</P>
<P>
ACI, whose West Coast sales office is in Canoga Park, claims to be the nation's 
biggest provider of 900 numbers, handling about 350 programs that were 
developed in-house or for others. The company, owned by Las Vegas businessman 
Jim Feist, says it receives 1 million calls per month that provide it with $50 
million to $75 million in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Canseco, ACI's programs include messages from rock stars, such as Paula 
Abdul, and rap singers, such as MC Hammer, horoscopes from Sydney Omarr and 
stock tips from Wall Street analysts. ACI also offers a phone version of the 
game show "Family Feud," in which callers accumulate points each time they call 
(for 95 cents per minute). Magazines and retailers use ACI's 900 service for 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
But with ACI's success has come problems. Although the company says it runs an 
honest shop, the entire 900 business has come under criticism from consumer 
groups for being more hype than information. And ACI feels the publicity's 
sting along with its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
The 900 industry overall was born in the early 1980s but did not take off until 
1988, and now it encompasses thousands of services that had combined revenue of 
nearly $500 million last year, according to Rich Parkhill, who publishes the 
trade magazine InfoText in Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me a lot, the criticism," said Charlie De Natale, who along with 
Floyd O'Neil and Kris Kupczyk are ACI's top officers in Canoga Park. He blames 
some bad apples in the 900 business that, in not delivering what they promise, 
are not making "this instrument a valuable source of information and 
entertainment for people." 
</P>
<P>
Feist said the fraud that does occur on 900 programs -- namely, advertising a 
product and then not delivering it -- has been done for decades in other media, 
but "because 900 numbers are so new, they're getting an awful lot of 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Another blow came last week, when Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based 
consumer group, issued a study that blasted the 900 industry for fraudulent 
advertising. The group said "most advertised 900 numbers are unfair at any 
price," and urged state and federal regulators to stop "the rip-offs that 
increasingly characterize pay-per-call services." 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Action did not cite ACI nor any of its programs, and group researcher 
Stephen Texeira acknowledged that "there are certainly some legitimate 
players." Still, the complaints involve ACI at least by association. "It's a 
problem," said O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
ACI also is not mistake-free. At one point last year, Canseco was supposed to 
update his 900 message every day, but didn't bother for three consecutive days, 
De Natale said. So ACI's customers weren't getting what ACI was advertising 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to track the guy down to make sure he doesn't do this again," De Natale 
said. "It's not his neck that's really on the line. Yeah, he'll get the 
criticism in the paper, but we can't afford in the 900 business to have that 
kind of thing happen." 
</P>
<P>
Besides keeping Canseco -- whose 900 fee is not disclosed -- on a short leash, 
ACI has another strategy to boost its image along with its revenue. The company 
increasingly is trying to get Fortune 500 companies to use 900 numbers for 
selling their products and services, sampling public opinion and offering 
sweepstakes promotions. 
</P>
<P>
"Corporate America is where the business has got to go," O'Neil said. "We've 
got to legitimize our business much more. A lot of get-rich-quick people have 
hopped on the bandwagon, put up programs and then walked away to go on to some 
other business venture." 
</P>
<P>
The 900 programs initially were too closely tied to adult phone services, which 
left corporate America "sitting on the sidelines for years, afraid to join the 
game, because of fears of tainting their corporate image," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those fears have abated somewhat, with companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, 
Revlon and ABC Television developing 900 services. In addition, the blue-chip 
companies American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and American Express last year 
formed a joint venture, Call Interactive, that develops and operates 900 
programs for others. 
</P>
<P>
ACI offers a similar "service bureau," in which someone can get a 900 service 
started for under $5,000 -- excluding advertising, which is the biggest cost in 
launching a successful 900 program. About half of ACI's revenue comes from its 
service bureau. 
</P>
<P>
As for ACI's plan to solicit more Fortune 500 accounts, the idea is not unique. 
Call Interactive, which has 140 pay-per-call programs, also focuses on 
"business-to-consumer applications," said Brian Rivette, vice president of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Call Interactive also is trying to improve the public's perception of 900 
services by closely evaluating each 900 proposal it gets and looking "for 
programs that offer the caller a value equivalent to the amount paid" for the 
call, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feist, 46, started ACI in 1987. But he'd been investing in 900 since the early 
1980s, when he started a 900 service that gave out sports scores. Correctly 
assuming that the 900 business would eventually explode and carry fatter profit 
margins, he made a multimillion-dollar investment in 900 channels and in 
telecommunications and computer equipment to handle the calls. 
</P>
<P>
Today, calls to ACI's numbers average about 3 minutes, and the fee that ACI and 
the telephone companies get from each call varies. But in the case of a $6 call 
to Canseco's line, the long-distance carrier -- in this case Telesphere Inc. -- 
gets $1.71 and ACI gets the rest to cover its costs (including Canseco's fee) 
and clear a profit, De Natale said. The local telephone company, such as 
Pacific Bell, that initially hooks up the call negotiates its own fees with the 
long-distance carrier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
What if Canseco goes into a slump? De Natale isn't worried, because Canseco's 
popularity stems as much from his controversial personal life as from his 
batting average. In fact, he's the only sports star ACI is currently touting. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe in the potential of other sports personalities right now," 
he said. For instance, rival New York Yankees slugger Don Mattingly "wouldn't 
draw flies" on 900 because he's "low profile," De Natale said. 
</P>
<P>
But De Natale is looking for the day when Canseco shares the 900 stage with the 
likes of Kellogg and Kimberly-Clark. "All we have to do to maintain our status 
is align ourselves with these people," he said.

SALES OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES RISE IN MAY, BUT PACE IS FAR BEHIND LAST YEAR'S 
FIGURES; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: LOCAL REALTORS SAY SALES REMAIN STRONG FOR PROPERTIES COSTING LESS 
THAN $300,000.

<P>
Sales of single-family houses in the San Fernando Valley climbed 7% in May, to 
882 from 824 in April, but the sales pace was a sharp 34% below the 1,383 sold 
a year ago, the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The average resale price of a single-family house climbed 1% in May, to 
$306,400 from $303,100 in April. Prices were 7% higher than in May, 1989, when 
the average resale price was $287,400. 
</P>
<P>
The average resale price of a condominium in the Valley, meanwhile, rose 3% to 
$153,100 from $149,000 in April. But the average price was virtually the same 
as the $153,410 set in May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The number of monthly condominium sales was almost unchanged. In May, 339 
condominiums were resold, compared to 338 in April. But the pace of sales for 
May dropped off steeply -- by about 30% -- from May, 1989, when 481 
condominiums were resold. 
</P>
<P>
"The single most important factor influencing sales activity is affordability," 
board President Becky Roberts said in a statement. "Sales remain hot for 
properties priced under $300,000. The higher you go from that figure, the 
softer the market gets." 
</P>
<P>
The board's executive director, Jim Link, predicted that the large supply of 
unsold houses would prevent single-family house prices from rising as quickly 
as they did in 1988 and 1989. "Those days are gone," Link said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgages from area banks and 
savings and loans showed little movement throughout the month, hovering between 
10% and 11%. And Link said the rates had little effect on sales recently, 
because mortgage interest rates were at levels comparable to what they were in 
1988 and 1989, when the pace of sales was much faster than today. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley realty board is California's largest, and it reports on sales of 
houses and condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to 
Agoura.

CREATIVE SOFTWARE HELPS BRAINSTORMING; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: TWELVE YEARS AND $4 MILLION IN THE MAKING, A NEW PROGRAM IS DESIGNED 
TO BE A TOOL FOR IGNITING THE INVENTIVE SPARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Marshall Fisher gives a sales pitch for his computer software package, he 
holds out the tantalizing torch of innovation. 
</P>
<P>
He asks how much a potential customer would pay for a key to the subconscious 
mind, a tool that unlocks a warm flood of creativity and helps refine and 
structure a thought into a brilliant idea. 
</P>
<P>
How about $495 (personal computer not included)? asks Fisher, a creativity guru 
and president of Fisher Idea Systems Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, who spent $4 million and 12 years developing a creativity software 
program called IdeaFisher, proclaims that the program is a "must-have" 
brainstorming tool for everyone in search of a creative spark, from tiny 
advertising agencies to Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using the computer to expand the thinking process instead of just 
crunching numbers," said Fisher, who amassed a personal fortune as co-founder 
of Century 21 Real Estate, the world's largest residential real estate 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's small office in Irvine is plastered with reviews published since 
IdeaFisher was introduced a year ago. With 300 books on creativity and the 
thinking process lining his shelves, Fisher is girded to fend off the criticism 
that he is trying to bottle something magical. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fisher concedes that IdeaFisher is no substitute for independent 
thinking, he says it enables people to dip ideas into a pool of word 
associations or refine those ideas through a series of questions. The program 
recognizes that thinking is a process. And it is designed to help a person 
generate ideas for solving problems in much the same way that strolling through 
a supermarket reminds you of all the options you have for cooking dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The software, which is designed for use on IBM, Apple and compatible personal 
computers, consists of two main features: the QBank and the IdeaBank. 
</P>
<P>
QBank contains more than 3,000 questions that help put a problem in focus. The 
user types in an idea and the program asks a series of questions that define 
the idea more precisely and additional queries that explore various avenues of 
thought. The program also asks questions comparing the quality of the idea with 
other ideas, using the results to pinpoint a starting point for a search 
through the IdeaBank. 
</P>
<P>
The IdeaBank is a database of 61,000 concepts structured into 28 major subjects 
and 387 subtopics -- all connected by 675,000 associations. Instead of using an 
alphabetical index, IdeaBank stores information much like the brain does: 
through associations. For instance, a word like car would be linked with 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of developing a creativity tool first struck Fisher in 1964, when he 
toyed with the idea of publishing a kind of "smart thesaurus," or a book of 
words and associated terms and concepts designed to help writers. Although he 
never completed the book, he revisited the idea in 1977 after selling his 
Century 21 holdings. He began work on a computerized version of his smart 
thesaurus. 
</P>
<P>
Linking the hundreds of thousands of associations contained in the IdeaBank and 
organizing them in a way that the computer could retrieve proved to be such a 
highly complex task that it took 12 years to complete, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has 10 full-time employees, at one time employed 250 people 
to type information into the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Cunningham, a principal at the Roberts Mealer Cunningham advertising 
agency in Costa Mesa, said he uses the program to help companies select new 
names. For one client, IdeaFisher was able to generate more than 5,000 proposed 
names. 
</P>
<P>
"There's concern about software replacing people in ad agencies," he said. "But 
I think it is like getting 100 bright people in the same room and putting their 
minds together. It puts pressure on other creative people to use it too." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Russo, a patent attorney in San Francisco, said he uses IdeaFisher to 
search for analogies when writing legal briefs and as a checklist generator 
when taking depositions from witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I use it to help form an idea like a conversation with a colleague would," he 
said. "It paid for itself the first time I used it. It's like having a yellow 
pad of paper that talks back to you." 
</P>
<P>
Jess Fisher, Marshall's son and the company's director of product development, 
cautions that the product isn't a panacea, and he doesn't guarantee IdeaFisher 
will work for everyone. An independent study by the University of Hawaii found 
that people who claimed to be drained of creativity reported a substantial 
increase in the number of ideas they were able to generate by using IdeaFisher. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Fisher declines to disclose sales figures, though he says he has not 
yet recovered his initial $4-million investment in the year the product has 
been out. There is little direct competition for the product, he said, saying 
that other products on the market focus on a single task, such as generating 
names for products. 
</P>
<P>
The Fishers aren't content with the attention they've generated with 
IdeaFisher. In September they will ship an updated version of the package. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it is negotiating with at least two larger companies to 
distribute IdeaFisher overseas. It is also developing custom versions for 
lawyers and other professionals and creating a laser-storage version of 
IdeaFisher that will use images rather than words. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying that we have to start thinking to be competitive and use every 
tool at our disposal to be inventive," Fisher said. "Otherwise we will be a 
third-rate country. Creativity makes the world go around. The rest is 
housekeeping."

COSTA MESA ALIEN BAN IS SUSPENDED BY KEMP; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRANT RIGHTS: THE HUD SECRETARY, IN OVERRIDING HIS GENERAL COUNSEL'S 
RULING, CITES A CONCERN FOR 'CLEAR INJUSTICES AND ABSURDITIES' THAT COULD 
RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp on Monday suspended a ruling 
by HUD's general counsel that said cities can withhold federal grant money from 
groups that serve illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a concern for the "clear injustices and absurdities" that could result 
from the opinion, Kemp called for an "urgent" meeting with immigrant rights 
groups and Costa Mesa officials who had originally proposed an alien-funding 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great news, I'm elated," said Vibiana Andrade, an attorney with the 
National Immigration Law Center who had vowed to sue any city that tried to 
enforce such a policy. "I think it's wonderful that they are putting the brakes 
on something that could have created a very bad precedent for any city that 
wants to implement restrictive policies." 
</P>
<P>
In a long-awaited ruling last week, HUD General Counsel Frank Keating said 
cities can implement such a policy without violating anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion sparked an outcry among immigrant-rights groups and representatives 
of other nonprofit rights organizations who warned that enforcement of such a 
policy could result in widespread discrimination against Latinos and radically 
alter the way the nonprofit groups operate. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's ruling was based in part on HUD regulations that went into effect 
June 1, prohibiting aliens who apply for immigration amnesty from benefiting 
from a HUD Community Development Block Grant for a period of at least five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Kemp suspended those regulations as well. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if Kemp had seen the ruling before it was issued. 
But after Kemp read news accounts, according to an aide, he became concerned 
about its ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
"The strict interpretation of the law is that the Costa Mesa policy is legal," 
said George Rodriguez, a special assistant to Kemp. "However, that does not 
mean that HUD endorses the policy." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said Kemp specifically was concerned with the implications of 
"letting cities or local jurisdictions carry the ball on immigration." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp also cited the impact "of putting nonprofits in the role of immigration 
agents," according to Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said he wants to meet as soon as possible with Rep. C. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach), Costa Mesa city officials, immigrant rights groups and 
"other concerned parties" to discuss the opinion and its possible impact. 
</P>
<P>
"The waffling by HUD on this measure is indicative of the political ambivalence 
towards immigrants," said Father Jaime Soto, Hispanic vicar for the Diocese of 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful that in HUD's reconsideration of this policy, they will find the 
political will to see beyond the anxious confusion that oftentimes predominates 
this debate," he said. "I hope they see the clear social interests in serving 
the residents of a community without distinction." 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa City Council had passed an alien-funding ban last August but 
subsequently voted to suspend it when federal authorities questioned whether it 
might violate anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
The policy stated that the city "will not consent to support individuals or 
agencies who employ, provide assistance to, house, feed or in any other 
fashion, support illegal aliens." The sole programs exempted were medical and 
dental services. 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's ruling, several Costa Mesa council members said they would 
seek to have the policy reinstituted. However, city officials said Monday that 
they will now likely put off any decision until after conferring with HUD 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we're greatly concerned with," Mayor Peter F. Buffa said. "I am 
going to put a call in to Secretary Kemp's office in the morning and will make 
sure that myself and other city officials are available to meet with Rep. Cox 
(who sought the HUD opinion on behalf of the city) and anyone else that the 
secretary suggests because we think this is a very important issue." 
</P>
<P>
It was expected that Buffa would be the swing vote on a decision to reinstitute 
the policy in Costa Mesa. The mayor previously voted to adopt the policy but 
then voted to suspend it pending HUD's ruling. However, after hearing of Kemp's 
concerns, Buffa said the city must move cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't particularly want to be in the position of being the first one 
through the door and seeing if a huge federal agency follows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Orville Amburgey, who had originally proposed the funding policy, on 
Monday questioned why city officials had not been forewarned of Kemp's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds to me like Mr. Kemp is trying to make political hay out of this 
issue," Amburgey said. "We have a very severe problem in Southern California 
with illegal aliens. As a representative of Costa Mesa constituents, I have to 
do whatever I can to mitigate it. . . . "As long as the interpretation of the 
policy is legal, that's all we want from them. It's become a national issue and 
very political, and I won't tolerate it. All we want to know is if we implement 
this policy will HUD withhold (Community Development Block Grant) money from 
us." 
</P>
<P>
But several immigrant rights advocates were heartened by Kemp's change in 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very good news," said Nativo Lopez, director of Hermandad Mexicana 
Nacional, a Santa Ana immigrant rights group. Lopez said he received a 
telephone call from Kemp's office to inform him of the new position. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes us more confident that he will look with more scrutiny and 
sensitivity at this policy to make sure that service care providers aren't 
pressed against the wall and made agents of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly," he continued, "in previous discussions we've had with 
Secretary Kemp, he has never expressed that view. That's why when this policy 
came down, we were quite shocked. We know that philosophically he doesn't think 
that way. We think he's more sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Holguin of the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and 
Constitutional Law exclaimed: "That's good, that's great." 
</P>
<P>
"Under the Reagan Administration, we would have expected such a policy decision 
(such as the one last week in support of the pending Costa Mesa policy), but 
the Bush Adminstration is a little more conscious of and sensitive about these 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holguin suggested that the Bush Administration is probably already under some 
pressure to show more sensitivity in its immigration policy in light of a 
recent report by the General Accounting Office of widespread discrimination by 
employers against immigrants or those who appear to be foreign-born. Under 1986 
reforms of the federal immigration law, employers are now required, under 
penalty of sanctions, to make sure that their workers are legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
"If they allow local governments to implement similar policies (that would 
require social service groups to verify a client's legal status), the outcry 
would be even more intense," Holguin said. "It just doesn't make political 
sense at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Norma Cantu, regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund's San Antonio office, agreed that the Bush Administration 
appears to be trying to overcome perceptions that immigration policy is 
discriminatory to some groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There is much too high a rate of discrimination in implementing immigration 
policy," Cantu said. "What the GAO report found is a barometer for what's 
happening out in our society. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned with policies such as this one (as proposed in Costa 
Mesa) because of the discrimination they can create," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1982 case pressed by attorneys for MALDEF, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 
that immigrants, regardless of their legal status, cannot be barred from 
attending public schools. The immigrant-rights group last week indicated that 
it would also keep a close eye on the Costa Mesa policy.

NO SWEAT? Will his vote against the sweatshop bill (B1) cost Assemblyman Curt 
Pringle (R-Garden Grove) votes in his district, where the sweatshops are 
located? . . . Hard to tell, says Democratic opponent Tom Umberg, who plans to 
make an issue of it. . . . Pringle found the bill unfair to manufacturers, but 
Umberg called it an issue of values: "This was a choice between corporations 
and children. . . . Whether he loses votes or not, he's on the wrong side."

FLAG DECISION SETS OFF SCRAMBLE IN CONGRESS; 
</P>

LEGISLATION: SOME SEEK SWIFT PASSAGE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. BUT POLLS SHOW 
THE ISSUE HAS LOST ITS STEAM. A ONE-THIRD MINORITY CAN BLOCK ACTION.

Spurred by a Supreme Court ruling, key members of Congress on Monday demanded 
swift passage of a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, while 
outnumbered opponents scrambled to line up votes to block it. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of an amendment are helped by several factors. Congress' top two 
Republican leaders -- Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Rep. Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) 
-- are leading the charge, with President Bush's enthusiastic backing. They 
also have strong support from two key Democrats -- the chairmen of the Senate 
and House Judiciary committees: Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-R. I.) and Rep. 
Jack Brooks (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, key votes will take place in the patriotic atmosphere surrounding 
Flag Day, which falls on Thursday, and the Fourth of July, less than three 
weeks later. And in the charged politics of an election year, lawmakers will be 
wary of casting votes on emotional issues that might inspire negative TV ads by 
their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"People who vote (against the amendment) will have to go home and explain," 
said Dole, the Senate minority leader. "It will make a good 30-second spot." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, opponents of the flag-burning amendment appear to have several 
things going for them, too. Opinion polls indicate that the issue has lost 
steam in recent months and that it is insufficient to decide an election by 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also have a statistical advantage: A constitutional amendment can be 
blocked by a one-third minority in either house of Congress. And Congress' top 
two Democrats -- House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) -- have vowed to fight it vigorously, with 
the expected help of several prominent Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now within 10 or 15 votes of stopping it," said Rep. Don Edwards (D-San 
Jose), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights. "But it's awful tough. There's a mindless stampede out there, and, if 
it passes, the President will sign it and the states will step all over 
themselves to ratify it." 
</P>
<P>
Dole pressed for quick approval of the amendment on Flag Day, but he was 
rebuffed by Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a grievous error in the haste and heat of controversy to amend the 
Bill of Rights," Mitchell said, adding later that there will be "ample 
opportunity to discuss this issue in the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Brooks announced that his Judiciary Committee will act on a 
proposed amendment next Tuesday and will bring it to the House floor before 
July 4. 
</P>
<P>
"The flag is too important a symbol of our nationhood and all that we have 
struggled for over the past two centuries to leave it unprotected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By overwhelming margins, the Senate and the House voted last fall to pass the 
Flag Protection Act, which was ruled unconstitutional by the high court Monday. 
Shortly after passing the statute, the Senate voted, 51 to 48, in favor of a 
constitutional amendment -- 15 votes short of the required two-thirds majority. 
There has been no vote in the House on an amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) reaffirmed that he strongly supports an amendment, 
but Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), long an opponent, did not respond to a 
request for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who last year introduced his own 
constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration, said Monday that he was not 
surprised by the Supreme Court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted for the law last year (that the court struck down Monday) under 
protest. I knew it was a big waste of time," Dornan said. "Why would the 
Supreme Court change and look like politicians who flip-flop all the time? 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I voted for it was because I didn't want to answer to a lot of 
veterans groups: 'Why did I vote against protecting the flag?' " 
</P>
<P>
Dornan predicted that both the Senate and the House will quickly pass a 
constitutional amendment, and that it will be ratified by the required 38 state 
legislatures within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"(House Speaker Thomas) Foley promised the President and all of us that we get 
a vote on this," Dornan said. "It will pass the House, and it will pass the 
Senate. Most of the state legislatures have adjourned for the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get 38 of them . . . but I believe it will go through as quickly 
as any (constitutional) amendment ever did." 
</P>
<P>
Political operatives were cautious about gauging the impact of the issue on 
this year's elections. But strategists in both parties agreed that much of the 
initial public indignation that followed last year's court decision on the 
matter has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody is going to win or lose an election on this," said 
political consultant Lyn Nofziger, a one-time aide to former President Ronald 
Reagan.

ASSEMBLY ACTS TO CRACK DOWN ON SWEATSHOPS 
</P>

<P>
The Assembly on Monday approved a bill aimed at cracking down on the latest 
proliferation of garment industry sweatshops in Orange and Los Angeles counties 
by making designer-name garment houses responsible for child labor and overtime 
abuses committed by their independent suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles), was 
introduced in March after a series of articles in The Times revealed that many 
independent contractors still run sweatshops paying as little as $1.45 an hour 
to children and immigrants, including Southeast Asians relocating to such 
Orange County communities as Garden Grove, Santa Ana and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who represents those areas, joined 
his Republican colleagues in voting against the bill on Monday, but a 
Democratic majority gave Hayden's measure the 44-30 margin needed to pass the 
lower house and be sent to the Senate for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the bill, name-brand clothing manufacturers would be held 
"jointly liable" for labor and safety violations committed by their 
subcontractors, many of whom pay immigrant children and women by the piece of 
clothing sewn in their homes or in crowded, fire-prone shops. Depending on the 
complexity of the job and the speed of the stitcher, the piece rate often 
translates into less than the California minimum wage of $4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, these independent jobbers have avoided paying fines by simply 
folding their operations when caught and cited by state labor officials, 
leaving many of the exploited workers stranded even without their minimum 
wages. But Hayden's bill would change that by placing the burden of the fines 
and back pay on the manufacturers, who hired the independent jobbers in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden and supporters of the bill -- the California Labor Federation and the 
International Ladies' Garments Workers' Union -- say the change is necessary 
because of widespread labor abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an industry where there's a lot of documented lawlessness -- 
child-labor violations, unsafe working conditions, fire hazards, people not 
getting paid what they deserve," Hayden said. "And it's the very structure of 
the industry that's out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the bill) is to make the manufacturer liable for the rampant lawlessness 
instead of what they now do, which is reap the benefit but take none of the 
burden," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden added that his bill was intended to close a "gaping hole" in the 
garment-manufacturing registration law of 1980, which was enacted after reports 
of widespread labor abuses in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The bill received support from Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los 
Angeles), whose district encompasses the downtown Los Angeles garment district. 
"On any given day, you can go to any one of these buildings and see the most 
deplorable working conditions imaginable," she said, adding that some shops 
have structural problems, blocked exits and piles of flammable materials. 
</P>
<P>
But Pringle, who said he was equally opposed to the labor abuses, maintained 
that the Hayden bill would place an inappropriate burden on the manufacturers, 
who cannot be assumed to know about the alleged infractions of their 
subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not where the person who makes the contract specifically knows that 
the independent contractor is breaking the laws," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody is doing something wrong, they should be punished for it and not 
everybody up and down the line," Pringle added. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County legislators voting against Hayden's bill were Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress); Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos); Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach); 
Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad); Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach); Ross 
Johnson (R-La Habra) and John R. Lewis (R-Orange). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Hayden's bill now goes to the Senate, where it will be examined by a committee 
and then the full upper house. If the bill is amended, it will be sent back to 
the Assembly for agreement before being forwarded to Gov. George Deukmejian, 
who can either veto it or sign the measure into law. 'We're going to have to 
work to get the governor's attention on this, to show it is good for 
responsible businesses and the sort of thing that is overdue,' Hayden has said.

HALO WILL SOON SHINE AGAIN AT ANGELS' STADIUM

<P>
The halo that once shone brightly over Anaheim, a beacon of good news that the 
California Angels had just won, will shine again after more than five years in 
the dark. 
</P>
<P>
The Big A, the monument that towers over Anaheim Stadium, soon will get the 
first major face lift in its 25-year history and again signal Angels baseball 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Smith, general manager of the stadium, said that the Big A was never the 
same after its transition from a scoreboard in the outfield to a message board 
in the parking lot in 1979. The move was part of the stadium's preparations for 
the arrival of the Los Angeles Rams football team. But by fall of 1984, the 
sign was completely on the blink and had to be shut down for good, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recent profitable years at the stadium, however, such as last year's revenues 
of nearly $1.5 million, have made improvements possible. And repairing the 
234-foot-high, 210-ton sign and its 70-foot-wide halo inevitably came up as an 
option. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time, it was the tallest structure in Orange County. . . . It's a 
landmark," said Smith, who justified spending $642,000 on the renovation by 
saying that the cost will be partially offset by money made from advertising on 
the message portion of the sign. 
</P>
<P>
That electronic message board, which once posted game scores in the outfield, 
now sits on the eastern edge of the stadium parking lot, in clear view of 
commuters on the Orange Freeway. Now it will advertise games, exhibitions and 
events held at the stadium -- as well as their sponsors. Smith said the message 
board can be seen from nearly a mile away, but he could only guess on the 
halo's visibility: "as far as the Southern California smog will allow it to be 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
Repairs are scheduled to be finished by mid-December, as long as the Anaheim 
City Council approves the suggested contractor as expected at its meeting 
tonight.

SUCCESS WAS OCEAN AWAY;

COMMENCEMENT: A VAST SEA AND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE DIDN'T STOP THE DETERMINED 
YOUTH WHO WILL GIVE SADDLEBACK HIGH SCHOOL'S VALEDICTORY ADDRESS.

<P>
It took Saddleback High School valedictorian Bang Phi Dang nearly nine years to 
prepare for his commencement address. 
</P>
<P>
When the 17-year-old delivers his speech to his fellow graduates on Thursday, 
he will urge them "to take advantage of the opportunities America has to 
offer." It will be a speech born out of years of hardship and adversity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not hard to succeed if you have the drive and determination to succeed," 
Dang said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dang has done more than just succeed. He has persevered. He has not just 
struggled with adversity, he has overcome it. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1982, when he arrived in California from Vietnam by way of two 
refugee camps in the Philippines, Dang could barely say more than "hello" in 
English. Today, he has a 4.695 grade-point average and, by summer's end, he 
will have amassed enough college credits to earn an associate's degree from 
Orange Coast College. In the fall, he'll continue his advanced work in computer 
science and electrical engineering at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
Dang, a slight youth, is remarkably reserved for his age. He speaks of his past 
in a careful, deliberate manner, seemingly emotionally detached from the 
hardship that shaped his personality. He is articulate and his speech carries 
scarcely a trace of accent. His experiences have, in effect, made him 
prematurely mature, his teachers say. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go through adverse experiences, you grow a lot," said Jack Ollestad, 
Dang's physics teacher. "He's gone through a lot that a lot of kids haven't 
gone through and that's matured him more." 
</P>
<P>
For Dang, the adversity started at the age of 2, when his father, Phi Dang, was 
captured on a battlefield in South Vietnam two weeks before the fall of Saigon 
and interned in a Communist re-education camp. Dang didn't see him again for 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
By the time his father was released in 1981, Bang Dang was a young schoolboy 
enrolled in a strictly controlled, government-run Vietnamese elementary school. 
Dang said the school was not the optimum environment for a child eager to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very oppressive" in Vietnamese schools, Dang said. "All the materials 
are controlled. Everything is censored. You can't express your feelings or 
thoughts. You have to be careful about what you say in school or you'll be 
whipped." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1981, Dang, his two brothers and his father boarded a rickety boat and 
set out on the ocean. (Dang's mother and two sisters were left behind, but a 
short time later they emigrated to Canada, and the family was eventually 
reunited in Santa Ana.) After 12 days at sea, Phi Dang and his three sons 
arrived in the Philippines, where they spent the next 17 months in two refugee 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions were poor, but the camps turned out to be a valuable experience for 
Dang. The free exchange of ideas in schools run by American volunteers provided 
his first glimpse of a non-censored education. But even after attending schools 
in the camps and in America, Dang still had a problem grasping the new system. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't express his own ideas willingly or comfortably (at the start of his 
senior year)," said Christine Lammers, Dang's teacher in advanced-placement 
English. "My classroom is an open exchange of ideas. Bang was just amazed that 
we could discuss (a subject) freely and openly. After five years of California 
education, he realized it's OK to have ideas different from the instructor." 
</P>
<P>
Dang stepped onto American soil for the first time on Nov. 23, 1982. He was 8 
years old. His arrival here, however, did not end his troubles. In some 
respects, they were just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult when I came here to the U.S. at the end of '82," said 
Dang, who was enrolled in fourth grade when he arrived. "I was very reticent 
the first year. I remember one time -- I will always remember this -- I was 
hiding in one corner (of a classroom) always avoiding all the other kids 
because I didn't know what they were saying." 
</P>
<P>
But, Dang added, the language barrier only heightened his resolve to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids were teasing me because of my handicap in English," he said. 
"But it also gave me an inspiration, a determination to succeed in learning 
English." 
</P>
<P>
As in all of his other courses, Dang excelled in his study of English, and it 
quickly became clear that he was more than just an average student. In fifth 
grade, just a year after his arrival and still struggling with his new 
language, he was placed in a pre-algebra class. 
</P>
<P>
By sixth grade, he no longer needed his English as a Second Language class, and 
his math skills were so advanced that his junior high school principal 
conducted special lessons in second-year algebra for Dang and two other 
prodigies. In seventh grade, he was sent to Valencia High School in Placentia 
for advanced algebra. He skipped the eighth grade entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Dang attributed his academic success to the loving support of his family and 
the intellectual stimulation provided by his teachers. "I was always very 
successful because there's always been someone there to care for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But his teachers said that at times, they feared Dang was damaging himself with 
an all-work, no-play attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"He gives off an aura of a kid who has a little more depth than someone of his 
age group," Lammers said. "I've been delighted to note in the last couple of 
months that he's lightened up a little bit. He essentially has grown up -- he's 
learned that life isn't only study." 
</P>
<P>
Dang, who participates in a wide range of extracurricular activities, agreed 
that he has lightened up somewhat. His Vietnamese culture, he said, emphasizes 
unceasing work, but through a wide range of extracurricular activities, he has 
managed to relieve some of the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the lifestyle of American kids as being more balanced than that of 
Vietnamese kids," he said. "Without some activities, sooner or later that 
stress is going to build up."

FESTIVAL PUTS OCEAN IN THE LIMELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As an oil tanker fire raged in the Gulf of Mexico and with memories still fresh 
of the Huntington Beach spill, Newport Beach officials and environmentalists 
Monday announced plans for a festival they hope will heighten awareness of the 
grim realities of toxic pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Against a backdrop of pleasure boats at the Lido Marina Village wharf, a group 
representing more than 100 businesses and organizations and calling itself Stop 
Toxic Ocean Pollution warned that without the proper precautions, the idyllic 
coastal lifestyle could fall victim to pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"As I stand here today, a Norwegian (oil) tanker is about to sink in the Gulf 
of Mexico," said Robert H. Sulnick, executive director of the Santa 
Monica-based American Oceans Campaign, a national, nonprofit organization that 
will receive proceeds from the June 24 festival and a golf tournament the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
"And in Huntington Beach . . . we had the best possible scenario (weather and 
terrain) for an oil spill, and still couldn't clean it up," he said, referring 
to the February incident in which the tanker American Trader dumped thousands 
of gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean, closing public shores from Seal 
Beach to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the spill dealt a financial blow to ocean sports-related 
retailers and tourist businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will be on the streets of Lido Marina Village in Newport Beach 
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and will include a chowder cook-off, live entertainment, 
environmental awareness education and a host of celebrity supporters. On June 
25, a $325-per-person celebrity golf tournament is scheduled from 9 a.m. to 5 
p.m. at the Tustin Ranch Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Mayor Ruthelyn Plummer praised the festival as a way to "get the 
grass-roots support that is going to send a message to our legislators," while 
Sulnick called Orange County "one of the focal points of ocean protection for 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, Orange County's coastal city officials have worked with local 
congressmen to fight federal plans to lease offshore oil drilling tracts in 
area waters. 
</P>
<P>
The American Oceans Campaign has lobbied for the same goals from its Washington 
office, in addition to serving as an umbrella organization for other prominent 
environmental groups on ocean preservation issues. 
</P>
<P>
On the local front, the Huntington Beach-based Surfrider Foundation, founded in 
1984 with the same goals as the 2-year-old American Oceans Campaign, will have 
a booth at the festival although it won't receive proceeds from the 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
The American Oceans Campaign lobbies for oil spill liability legislation, 
moratoriums on offshore drilling, development of alternative fuels, bans on 
gill-net fishing and toxic dumping and increased protection of coastal 
ecosystems. WENDY PAULSON

NEIGHBORS BATTLING RACE TRACK CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNDA NATALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Howard tolerates the noise from the daily races at Los Alamitos Race Course 
because he has to. He knew when he bought his home more than 20 years ago that 
the horses and jockeys would be his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But when singer Juice Newton and her entourage pulled into town for a gig at 
the race track last month, the noise was more than he could take. 
</P>
<P>
"I could understand every word Juice said when she talked to the crowd," said 
Howard, a 23-year resident of Laurel Avenue, a housing tract across the street 
from the track. 
</P>
<P>
So Howard and some of his neighbors went to City Hall for help. Speaking at a 
recent council meeting, residents of Laurel Avenue and surrounding streets 
recounted how they couldn't hold a conversation in their homes during Newton's 
concert and a previous one. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted no more concerts to be held," said Jim Young, who represents the 
neighborhood group. But because of a loophole in a city ordinance, Young may 
have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the ordinance was intended to prohibit concerts at the race track. 
It was passed more than nine years ago after then state Sen. Paul Carpenter 
held a fund-raiser at the track that included a country-style barbecue and 
band, and the neighbors complained about the noise. The City Council decided 
that all future events not related to the track would require a conditional use 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
But Juice Newton and the previous concerts were part of a promotional package 
for the racing, City Manager Darrell Essex told the current City Council. Her 
show was included in the regular price for admission to the park. Because, it 
was a "race-related" event, there was little the council could do, Essex 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent a letter suggesting that they would have to decrease (noise) or apply 
for a conditional use permit," Essex said. But enforcing that request might be 
tough, officials admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood group is confident that this ordinance is all they needed to 
fight the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our understanding going back to 1980 is that there are to be no more 
concerts," Howard said. "It was a violation of an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The residents and race track officials are trying to reach some accord. During 
a recent meeting, race track officials agreed to adjust the volume during the 
next concert, on June 23. They will also try to reduce the echo effect produced 
in the stands by turning the speakers in a different direction. In return, the 
residents agreed not to try to prevent the next concert. 
</P>
<P>
But residents insist that even the measures to tone down the noise will not be 
good enough. "I just don't think it (lowering the noise to an acceptable level) 
can be done," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
During their meetings, it was also tentatively agreed that if the neighbors 
"can hear the music, there will be no more concerts," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
But track general manager Don Galloway said that with attendance figures 
skyrocketing by up to 3,000 people on the nights of the promotions, "I would 
like to see if we couldn't continue with it. It is very popular." 
</P>
<P>
If the music is still too loud for the residents, he said, "we will address 
that when we come to it. We don't know what the city might want us to do."

FREEWAY CRASH KILLS PICKUP TRUCK DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and another injured when their pickup truck missed a curve 
and crashed on the Riverside Freeway in Anaheim, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Gabriel Frausto, 29, of Placentia, was pronounced dead at the 
scene, while his passenger, Frank Estrada, 30, address unknown, was treated at 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana for moderate injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The accident happened at 4:05 a.m. Sunday when the 1988 Toyota pickup, driven 
at high speed on the transition from the westbound Riverside Freeway to the 
northbound Orange Freeway, missed a curve and overturned, according to 
California Highway Patrol officials. Both occupants, who were not wearing seat 
belts, were ejected from the truck, CHP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP was investigating to determine if the driver had been drinking.

CLASSES TO EXPLORE LEGAL ISSUES, RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A series of classes designed for the layman to understand legal rights and 
issues will begin Wednesday at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The course will explore legal problems such as divorce, real estate, wills, 
bankruptcy, DUI (driving-under-the-influence) charges and consumer issues. 
</P>
<P>
The "People's Law School" also will have a session on the legal rights of 
victims of rape and other violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana attorney James J. DiCesare will join Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane L. Shade 
in discussing both the criminal and civil aspects of violent crime. DiCesare, 
who handles product and premise liability cases, said the course would set a 
number of legal issues straight for the public. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to know how the legal system works when there is a violent 
crime," DiCesare said. "We will discuss both the responsibility of the 
perpetrator of the crime under the law and the responsibility of third parties, 
such as the liability of owners of establishments, apartment houses or sporting 
events and their responsibility for wrongful conduct." 
</P>
<P>
"People should know how it works, yet they shouldn't have to be a victim to 
know how it works. They shouldn't have to go through the trauma and the 
heartbreak to know how the system operates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Family law will be the subject of the June 20 class. Discussions will focus on 
divorce law, domestic relations, child custody and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The course will be from 7 to 9 p.m. Wednesdays from this week through Aug. 15 
at the Nelson Auditorium in the Whitby Building on the UC Irvine campus. To 
register visit the UCI Extension Registration Office on Pereira Drive west of 
Berkeley Road on campus, or call (714) 856-5414. 
</P>
<P>
The fee is $10 per seminar or $70 for the nine-week series. MARY ANNE PEREZ

A man who was arrested after he tried to rent videos under an assumed name was 
found to have $140,000 in outstanding arrest warrants charging him with a 
variety of crimes, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
James Dale McNeil, 47, used a number of aliases when arrested for crimes 
allegedly committed throughout Southern California, including two incidents of 
assault with a deadly weapon, grand theft and felony drunk driving, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil, who told police that he had been living in a San Clemente motel for two 
weeks, will be arraigned in South County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel today 
on charges of resisting arrest, obstructing a police officer and giving false 
information to an officer, Police Sgt. Richard Downing said. He was being held 
at Orange County Jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil was trying to rent videos under an assumed name Sunday night when a 
suspicious shop owner called police and then chased the suspect as he ran out 
of the store, Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
"He shouted at me that he would hurt me if I chased him, and then he ran away," 
said Sue Lee of Video Mart, 907 S. El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
As Lee pursued the suspect, who is 6-foot-1 and weighs 200 pounds, she yelled 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that more than 20 bystanders were chasing the suspect when a squad 
car arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect tried to escape but fell down a steep embankment near the San 
Clemente Pier and was captured without further incident, Downing said. FRANK

BRANCH MERGES WITH COUNTYWIDE YMCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport/Costa Mesa YMCA has merged with the Orange County YMCA to save on 
operating costs and avoid the possibility of closing. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County YMCA now oversees the fiscal operations of eight branches in 
the county, taking care of payroll, personnel, accounting and data processing. 
</P>
<P>
"This moves all the technical support functions into one office and frees up 
the local branch staff to run the programs," said Jerry Nutter, president of 
the Orange County YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
The merger became effective June 1, but representatives of both sides signed 
the agreement Monday night. Nutter said he does not anticipate laying off any 
of the 45 full- or part-time workers because of the move. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, this moves them to more productive roles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport/Costa Mesa branch, 2300 University Drive, Newport Beach, with a 
$1.3-million annual budget, was operating under a $380,000 deficit that could 
have forced it to close, Nutter said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was definitely in the wings," he said. "We were concerned because that 
community deserves a 'Y.' " 
</P>
<P>
The majority of a branch's funds, nearly 90%, come from fees generated from 
classes and the use of its facilities. The rest comes from sustaining 
membership donations and funds from the United Way. 
</P>
<P>
George Scobas, executive director of the Newport/Costa Mesa branch, said the 
merger will not eliminate any of the programs or classes offered at that 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be stronger for it. This gives us more discipline on how monies 
are spent and how the facilities are developing. There's also somebody looking 
over the operation of the branch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The branch offers child care, an aquatics program, summer camp activities and a 
parent-child program. MARY ANNE PEREZ

$100,000 SETTLEMENT IN OCTD INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An elderly woman whose shoulder was torn as she stepped off a bus in 1987 will 
receive $100,000 from the Orange County Transit District, an unusually large 
payment by the agency in a personal-injury action, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of a settlement reached in Orange County Superior Court last 
Thursday, Mildred Cole, 70, will receive $20,000 to cover the cost of two 
surgeries and another $80,000 for future medical bills and pain and suffering, 
said Ronald C. Staff, claims administrator for the OCTD. 
</P>
<P>
The payment stemmed from an accident at a bus stop at Bristol and Myrtle 
streets in Santa Ana, said Cole's lawyer, Michael E. Caston. Cole was stepping 
down from a bus but caught her hand in the rear door handle, he said. Before 
she could disengage herself, the bus driver started to pull away, tearing the 
connecting ligaments in Cole's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, who lives on Social Security, required two operations to repair her 
shoulder and might need a third, Staff said. Her range of motion in that 
shoulder is still limited, Caston said. 
</P>
<P>
Staff said the settlement is the second largest against the OCTD in this fiscal 
year, which ends June 30. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

PLANS MADE FOR 4TH OF JULY PARADE

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has announced plans for its 86th annual Fourth of July parade and 
8-kilometer race. 
</P>
<P>
The parade, the oldest such Fourth of July celebration west of the Mississippi 
River, is held on Main Street, starting in the downtown area near Pacific Coast 
Highway and ending at the Civic Center at Yorktown Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The first such parade in the city, on July 4, 1904, was held to greet the 
arrival of Henry E. Huntington's Pacific Electric Co. red rail cars, as 
Huntington ushered transit service into the then sleepy hamlet called Pacific 
City. Bringing the rail cars linked the tiny beach community to the booming 
Long Beach and Los Angeles areas. Community officials, in appreciation, changed 
the name of Pacific City to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the city has marked the Fourth of July with street parades. Usually 
a celebrity is tapped to be a parade marshal, and this year's marshal will be 
Los Angeles television newsman Ed Arnold, city officials announced. Arnold, a 
sports broadcaster and anchorman for KTLA-TV, lives in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 10 a.m. start of this year's parade, there will be a pancake 
breakfast sponsored by the Kiwanis Club and an 8-kilometer race, the proceeds 
of which go the March of Dimes.

</P>
<P>
CONVENTION: GUN FANCIERS WHO WANTED A LEADERSHIP SHAKEUP TO COUNTER LEGISLATIVE 
SETBACKS WERE DISAPPOINTED. THE EMBATTLED CEO WAS REELECTED UNANIMOUSLY.

<P>
Despite rumblings of a possible shakeup after one of the worst years in its 
history, the National Rifle Assn.'s board of directors offered no surprises 
Monday in its annual leadership elections as the gun lobby's convention here 
neared its end. 
</P>
<P>
Among those supported by the board was J. Warren Cassidy, the embattled chief 
executive officer who has been blamed by some among the NRA rank and file for 
the group's recent string of legislative losses at the state and federal 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
At a raucous general membership meeting here Saturday attended by about 1,000 
members, several vocal critics called for Cassidy's firing, claiming that he 
has helped turn the NRA into a "paper tiger." 
</P>
<P>
Internal critics charged that Cassidy has been too willing to appease 
gun-control activists and to compromise gun owners' rights. And the full body 
passed a non-binding resolution seeking to effectively shift power from Cassidy 
to the head of the NRA's lobbying arm. 
</P>
<P>
But at Monday's meeting of the 75-member board, which sets NRA policy, 
directors reappointed Cassidy by a unanimous voice vote as their executive vice 
president and top staff officer, a post he has held since 1986. There was no 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's precisely what we were afraid of," complained Manuel Fernandez of 
Sepulveda, one of the internal NRA critics. "We wanted a new person with a less 
compromising position, but (the board) is an old boys' club." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the board members adopted a business-as-usual demeanor Monday, with 
virtually none of the hostilities that marked the weekend meeting of the full 
NRA. The board concludes its two days of meetings today, winding down a six-day 
convention that drew an estimated 20,000 gun enthusiasts into Anaheim for a gun 
show, seminars and rallies. 
</P>
<P>
Directors discussed ways of getting more women and minorities into their ranks 
after a membership drop of 250,000 in the last four years, as well as trying to 
win over law-enforcement leaders who have become their chief foes on 
gun-control issues. 
</P>
<P>
But the NRA leaders signaled no dramatic changes in policy or strategies -- 
with the exception of a private satellite network that they are planning to use 
to link NRA members around the country. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, first vice president Richard Riley of New Hampshire ascended to 
the presidency of the 2.8-million-member group without opposition. In the view 
of some members, Riley offers the prospect of more aggressive leadership and a 
renewed attention to legislative lobbying -- once the strong suit of the NRA 
but now threatened by the recent losses. 
</P>
<P>
There have, in fact, been concerns among some NRA members that Riley might 
devote too much attention to battling gun-control legislation at the expense of 
other group interests, such as the hunting, gun safety and shooting programs. 
Riley confronted that concern in his acceptance speech Monday, saying: "I 
assure you that nothing could be further from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Riley replaces outgoing president Joe Foss, a war hero, former governor of 
South Dakota and commissioner of the old American Football League, who finished 
a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
A colorful and popular figure, the 75-year-old Foss pledged to continue to 
spread the "doctrine" of the NRA as a director. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to an unprecedented series of legislative efforts around the nation to 
ban certain weapons and place other restrictions on gun owners, Foss said: "I 
am still going to be battling the anti-gun people. . . . I love all guns, and 
I'll be fighting the anti-gun people as long as I breathe."

PARRISH HOMER ADDS TO DAVIS' DISAPPOINTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Anything could have happened, Mark Davis was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have popped it up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lance Parrish did not pop it up. He knocked Davis' two-out, ninth-inning 
fastball out of the park Monday night, giving the Angels a 3-2 victory over the 
Kansas City Royals and giving the Royals their seventh consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Davis would like to believe that he is close to breaking out of the form that 
has been a painful disappointment this season, both for him and the team that 
is paying him $13 million over four years, the team that viewed his 44 saves 
for the Padres last year as the final piece to the Royals' puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I was throwing the ball good tonight," Davis said. "He hit it well. He 
had to take the ball out of the park to beat me, and he did it." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Davis took his third loss of the season against one victory. He has 
five saves. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Macfarlane, the Royals' catcher, and John Wathan, the manager, both agreed 
with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
They thought he had good stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"We really felt Mark Davis threw the ball pretty well," Wathan said. "He got 
beat by one pitch. He hit it well, to the deepest part of the field. When he 
first hit it, I thought it was just a fly ball." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is rooting so hard for Davis, every time he goes out there," Wathan 
said. "Just as he seems to be getting the good innings he needs to build his 
confidence, something like this happens to take him down a peg." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have watched Davis this season agreed that this is the best he has 
looked in some time. 
</P>
<P>
Before Monday, he last pitched Friday at Oakland, retiring the two batters he 
faced. But he has blown three of his last four save opportunities, and is five 
for nine overall. For the most part, he has come in as a middle reliever, with 
no save opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he came on in the eighth, with Tom Gordon leaving the game with a 
muscle strain below his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, he struck out Chili Davis and Dave Winfield, and was working on 
Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Parrish who got the job done. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals would like to believe that they are close to turning the corner on 
what has become a wretchedly disappointing season. But such a thing is hard to 
say with conviction from 16 games behind the Oakland Athletics, who swept the 
Royals in Oakland over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
For the second day in a row, one run came between the Royals and the other 
team. Oakland beat them, 3-2, Sunday. The Angels, once expected to stand 
toe-to-toe together with Kansas City in challenging Oakland, did the same to 
the Royals Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the type of losses you want to look at positively if you can," said 
Davis. "If you dwell on it, it will only bring you down." 
</P>
<P>
The Royals are in the middle of a stretch of 13 games against the A's and the 
Angels, and that alone is bringing them down. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do well on our home stand and then continue that on the road," 
Davis said. "We haven't played the way we wanted to. We have to come back and 
battle as hard as we can. We battled, but they did the thing they needed to do 
to beat us. There's not much you can do about that." 
</P>
<P>
Today, they try again. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow I want to be able to throw the same type of stuff I did today," Davis 
said.

SINCE GETTING THE CALL, OPALINSKI AND PARTNER RINGING UP OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks before the Women's Pro Beach Volleyball Assn. tour started in April, 
Janice Opalinski had no partner and no worries. 
</P>
<P>
She was relaxing in Hawaii, taking a break from teaching science at Capistrano 
Valley High School, and contemplating her future on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
But her plans took a strange twist when she received a phone call from Jackie 
Silva, the leading money-winner on the tour last season, who was looking for a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, a two-time member of the Brazilian Olympic team, had planned to team 
with Rita Crockett-Royster of Costa Mesa this season. But Crockett-Royster had 
committed to play in an indoor league in Italy and would have to miss the first 
three beach tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
So Silva tracked down Opalinski. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't expect the call," said Opalinski, a former standout at Dana 
Hills High School. "When I left I had no partner and ran the risk of not having 
one when the tour started. I was going to have to be a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Opalinski and Silva originally agreed to play the first three tournaments 
together while Crockett-Royster was in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Those plans changed after they won the first three stops on the tour. They hope 
to win their sixth consecutive tournament this weekend at the Huntington Beach 
Open at the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"After three tournaments, we evaluated what we had done and decided to keep 
moving forward," Opalinski said. "But with Silva, you never know what she's 
going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Silva is one of the most outspoken and unpredictable players on the tour. In 
the last year, she has won 16 of the last 18 tournaments with four partners -- 
Opalinski, Crockett-Royster, Patty Dodd and Linda Chisholm-Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
Opalinski, who also is known for her fiery on-court demeanor, said she wasn't 
sure how the partnership was going to work out at first. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting because we're both strong personalities and we're used to 
being leaders," Opalinski said. "It created some conflict, but it also forced 
us to look at ourselves and be more patient when we play." 
</P>
<P>
Add volleyball: Beach volleyball players, like surfers, have a language all 
their own. The following are some of the terms you could hear from players at 
the Huntington Beach Open: 
</P>
<P>
Team Advil -- When two teammates are fighting and edgy with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Bambi -- A personality trait that makes a player tense and not play 
aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
UC State -- An unconscious state in which a player or team can do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp cocktail -- A short shot over the blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Jumbo shrimp -- A deep lob shot over the defensive player's head. 
</P>
<P>
Pipeline -- An offensive shot down the middle between two players. 
</P>
<P>
Husband/wife -- A down-the-middle serve between two players. 
</P>
<P>
Pokey -- When a player uses her knuckles to hit the ball over the net. 
</P>
<P>
Tomahawk/Tommy -- A two-handed shot that's either short or deep. 
</P>
<P>
Roof -- A blocked ball that a player can't cover. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities at the Huntington Beach Pier this weekend include a longboard 
surfing contest starting at 7 a.m. Saturday and Sunday, a wildest hairstyle 
contest at 1 p.m Sunday and a series of trivia contests. The PCH sky diving 
team is scheduled to land at center court to deliver the game ball for Sunday's 
volleyball final. The matches start at 8:30 a.m. each day and the finals are 
set for 3 p.m. Sunday. The tournament will be taped by ESPN and shown July 23 
at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Surfing insiders said Tom Curren lost his competitive edge last year when he 
moved to France and went into semi-retirement. 
</P>
<P>
But Curren has shown lately that he was doing more than sipping wine and 
nibbling on croissants and cheese in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Curren has won three of the first four events on the Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals world tour this season and currently leads the standings by 1,042 
points over Australia's Rob Bain. 
</P>
<P>
Curren competed in only one event last year, finishing second to Richie Collins 
of Newport Beach at the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
Curren, who grew up in Santa Barbara, moved to Biarritz, France, with his wife, 
Marie, early in 1989. Curren took the 1989 season off to spend more time with 
his wife and newborn daughter, Lee Ann. 
</P>
<P>
Since returning, he won the first three events on the tour -- all in Australia 
-- and then finished 33rd at the Coke Classic June 3 in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Collins is 13th in the standings with 3,278 points. His best finish this season 
was fifth at the Bundaberg Rum Masters at Burleigh Heads, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The next stop on the tour is the Gunston 500 at Durban, South Africa, June 
26-July 1. The Op Pro, the ninth stop on the tour, is scheduled for July 
30-Aug. 5 at the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente's Shane Beschen continues to lead the point standings of the 
Professional Surfing Assn. of America's U.S. tour, despite failing to make the 
quarterfinals at the Memorial Weekend Classic at Imperial Beach May 28. 
</P>
<P>
Beschen, a senior at San Clemente High School, leads second-place Sean Mattison 
of Carlsbad in the overall standings by 212 points. Beschen took the lead in 
April when he won the Easter Surfing Classic at Bolsa Chica State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
While Beschen struggled at Imperial Beach, Pat O'Connell of Laguna Niguel 
established himself as one of the hottest newcomers on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell, 18, won the Imperial Beach championship, his first contest as a 
professional, overcoming disaster in one of the heats. He broke his surfboard 
during his fifth heat, but a friend brought a backup board from O'Connell's 
nearby hotel room to keep the teen-ager in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell, a senior at Dana Hills High, is currently 14th in the overall 
standings with 1,863 points. Mike Stewart of Anaheim leads the PSAA's 
bodyboarding division by 334 points over Ben Severson of Wahiawa, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The next stop on the PSAA tour will be June 20-24 at the Oceanside Pier. 
</P>

KOLL CO. TO MANAGE HENLEY PROPERTIES' REAL ESTATE EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
The Koll Co. said Monday that it has been retained to manage the $500-million 
real estate portfolio of Henley Properties Inc., including the controversial 
housing development along the Bolsa Chica wetlands abutting Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Donald M. Koll was named president and a director of 
Henley, and his Newport Beach-based firm was hired to oversee Henley's 15 
Southern California properties and holdings in five other states. 
</P>
<P>
Henley operates in California through its subsidiary, Signal Landmark Co. in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Henley, a public company based in Hampton, N.H., nor the privately held 
Koll would disclose the value of the contract. But the management agreement is 
the largest ever for Koll, which has $4 billion worth of real estate under its 
control, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Koll and his highly respected organization will help us to accelerate the 
development of our real estate projects and undertake various transactions to 
realize the value of our holdings for the benefit of our shareholders," Michael 
D. Dingman, Henley's chairman and chief executive, said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
The contract allows Koll to participate in the profits that Henley makes from 
its projects and also to use Henley's resources to purchase major blocks of 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"My major thrust is going to be not only to manage properties but to redo some 
of the properties to try to get into large portfolios," Koll said. "We may buy 
several large properties and either develop them or spin them off." 
</P>
<P>
The management contract runs for five years with automatic one-year renewals. 
Signal Landmark's 45 employees and many of the other 150 Henley Properties 
employees will move into Koll headquarters in Newport Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is exciting to us," Koll said. "We'll have a public company, 
which we will be in charge of for making profits." 
</P>
<P>
While the Koll firm is privately held, Koll sits on the board of Wells Fargo 
and Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Henley's biggest single holding is the 12,000-acre Bolsa Chica wetlands and 
surrounding area which its Signal Landmark unit has been working on for years 
to develop. In an intricate plan drafted last year with the city, Orange County 
and the state, Signal Landmark reached a compromise that calls for preserving 
most of the Bolsa Chica area as natural wetlands but allows up to 5,700 homes 
on 412 acres on the bluff areas. 
</P>
<P>
The city is attempting to annex the wetlands, and Henley is supporting the 
effort. Henley and city officials said Monday that the corporate change would 
not affect their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Bolsa Chica is the key to the value of Henley Properties," said Walter D. 
Sanborn III, managing director of investor relations for Henley Group Inc., the 
former parent of Henley Properties. "It's the largest and most important 
parcel, and it's best managed by someone in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach city officials who were reached Monday approved of the 
Koll-Henley deal. 
</P>
<P>
"What we will have now is a shorter line of control," said City Councilman John 
Erskine. "The Koll Co. is based in Newport Beach. It's a local firm, and the 
control will be there, rather than out of state. I think that's good." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Lennon of the Orange County chapter of the Building Industry Assn. of 
Southern California said the agreement "sounds like a good relationship" that 
should avoid any conflict. Henley is primarily a residential land developer, 
and Koll continues to build various office and commercial complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Under the management contract, Koll has eliminated any conflict by agreeing to 
give Henley first shot at most business opportunities, such as the purchase of 
developable land, Sanborn said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal with Henley is the latest in a series of major ventures Koll has 
undertaken. Koll, for instance, recently acquired $300 million in property from 
Wells Fargo Mortgage &amp; Equity Trust. It also tried unsuccessfully to 
acquire 15,000 acres for $532 million from Union Pacific Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Koll has built or is building office complexes in Newport Beach, Irvine, 
Orange, San Diego and other California and Arizona cities. The firm is drawing 
up plans for a $200-million Koll Anaheim Center and is building a $200-million, 
28-story office tower in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The move to retain Koll is similar to other moves Henley Properties' parent has 
made as it has spun off various businesses over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The Henley Group itself was a 1986 spinoff from Allied-Signal Corp. The group 
consisted of 35 different businesses that didn't fit in Allied, and it has been 
reorganizing and spinning off companies ever since in an effort to increase 
shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
The Henley Group moved from La Jolla two years ago and spun off Henley 
Properties last December. Dingman is chairman of both companies. Koll replaces 
Paul M. Montrone as president. Montrone remains president of Henley Group and 
vice chairman of Henley Properties. 
</P>
<P>
In its first quarter, Henley Properties lost $2.2 million on revenue of $12.6 
million. The main reason for the loss, Sanborn said, was that the company 
didn't sell any significant amount of real estate to offset continuing expenses 
for the land it did own. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Bill Billiter contributed to this report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HENLEY PROPERTIES' HOLDINGS 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement announced Monday, the Koll Co. will manage the holdings of 
Henley Properties. Henley's Southern California holdings are owned through its 
Irvine-based Signal Landmark unit. Henley's major properties include:

2 FIRMS WORKING ON SYSTEM TO SPEED CREDIT-CARD SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Dean Takahashi, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Credit card purchases could soon take less time than cash transactions as a 
result of an agreement signed recently between two Irvine companies. 
</P>
<P>
Trintech USA, a start-up subsidiary of Trintech International of Dublin, 
Ireland, and CUE Network Corp., a paging company, have agreed to establish a 
data transmission system they say will allow instantaneous verification for 
credit-card purchases. 
</P>
<P>
With the credit-card verification procedure most retailers use, a clerk runs a 
customer's card through a point-of-sale machine. The machine dials a central 
computer, often at a bank, that contains a list of all bad credit cards. Next, 
a computer checks whether the customer's card is otherwise valid and whether 
the transaction is permitted, and it then notifies the point-of-sale machine 
with a verification or a rejection. 
</P>
<P>
The whole process takes about 15 seconds, most of which is the time involved in 
setting up the phone call to the central computer. During the holiday shopping 
season, the transaction can take longer because many more retailers will be 
using the verification system. 
</P>
<P>
Trintech USA's Xchecker point-of-sale system, now in the testing phase, will 
eliminate the need for the phone call and reduce the time needed for credit 
card verification to a few seconds, said Gene Swanzy, chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
CUE will supply the radio communications link that will allow banks to store 
the computerized list of roughly 500,000 invalid cards in Trintech's 
point-of-sale machines. Using CUE's radio paging technology, the database can 
be sent to the machines and updated daily, said Leo Jedynak, CUE vice president 
of product development. 
</P>
<P>
Swanzy said the system should lower retailers' costs by providing faster access

The point-of-sale terminals, which were developed in the United Kingdom by 
Trintech's parent company, will be manufactured for Trintech by a Finnish 
company, Swanzy said. Initial tests will verify MasterCard transactions. 
</P>
<P>
With speedier verification, Jedynak hopes that the new verification system will 
encourage the use of credit cards for small sales such as meals at McDonald's 
and movie tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"Since cash transactions often involve giving change, we can make using credit 
cards more convenient than cash," Jedynak said.

YACHT SELLERS FIND GOOD SAILING IN JAPAN; 
</P>
<P>
EXPORTS: THE JAPANESE, WITH MONEY AND MORE LEISURE TIME, HAVE A BUDDING LOVE 
AFFAIR WITH BOATING AND HAVE BECOME A GROWING MARKET FOR AMERICAN-BUILT LUXURY 
BOATS.

<P>
Toshi Ohashi's second-floor office affords a superb view of the luxury yachts 
that dot the blue water of the Harbor Club Tower and Marina on Lido Island, but 
he seems nearly oblivious to the serene setting outside. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not on the phone, the 39-year-old manager of Newport West Yacht Sales 
is busy meeting with Japanese clients and dashing off letters to clients across 
the Pacific. His company, a subsidiary of Toshin Keikaku, a Tokyo-based 
services company, is a conduit between Japanese leisure boat buyers and U.S. 
sellers. 
</P>
<P>
For an island nation, the Japanese have never shown much enthusiasm for boating 
as a recreational pursuit. But now the Japanese -- looking for ways to spend 
their growing leisure time -- are beginning a budding love affair with boating. 
And for a host of wealthy Japanese industrialists, financiers and real estate 
magnates, boating means big, sleek, expensive yachts. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese buyers are becoming increasingly important to U.S. boat builders, said 
Charlie Barthold, executive editor of Yachting magazine in New York. Yacht 
purchases by American buyers have been slumping for several years, he said, and 
the Japanese have taken up some of the slack. 
</P>
<P>
Boat brokers and builders say that orders from Japan have increased 
substantially this year. One major reason for this demand is a change in 
Japan's tax law last year, which has drastically cut tariffs on imports of 
foreign-made yachts to Japan. Buyers of boats that exceed 28 feet in length are 
now taxed at a rate of 5.5% of the boat's value, down from 32% previously. The 
change would slash the tax on the purchase price of a $300,000 yacht to only 
$16,500, down from $96,000 previously. 
</P>
<P>
But the tariff change is only one reason for Japan's boating boom. 
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to boost consumer spending on recreational pursuits, the 
Japanese government has been constructing new marinas all over Japan to 
alleviate a severe shortage of marina space and encourage pleasure boating 
among Japanese citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"The government took the lead in asking the Japanese to engage in recreational 
sports, and boating was one of them," said Herbert Pocklington, president of 
Hatteras International in High Point, N.C., the international sales arm of 
Hatteras Yachts Inc. He said his company's sales to Japanese buyers have 
doubled this year. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Japan's largest boat builders -- Yamaha and Nissan -- have helped fund 
construction of marinas, Pocklington said. "This is totally unheard of," he 
said. "It's like Boeing putting money into the construction of airports." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year or so, a growing number of fishermen have gone into the 
sportfishing business as a new source of income, Ohashi said. And the Japanese 
government, land developers and the fishing industry have banded together to 
build more marinas to ease a severe shortage of mooring space for yachts. 
</P>
<P>
"When the marinas are done, we expect sales of our boats to increase by three 
or four times in the next five to 10 years," said Charles Carricarte, 
international sales manager of Bertram Yachts &amp; Co., a boat maker in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Another major factor in the yacht-buying binge is the change in Japanese 
attitudes toward recreation and leisure time. Today's younger Japanese workers 
have more spare time than their parents, typically working a five- or 5 1/2-day 
workweek compared to the six-day week their parents were accustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
Newport West's Ohashi said the Japanese are fishermen at heart, but postwar 
industrialization briefly interrupted this natural affinity for the sea. In 
addition, the yen's strength against the dollar and the relaxation of import 
duties encouraged many affluent Japanese to buy products that would reflect 
their new economic power. 
</P>
<P>
And what more recognizable sign of wealth and power is there than a yacht? 
</P>
<P>
Yacht brokers say the Japanese are buying bigger and fancier yachts, some 
costing several million dollars or more. Brokers say the two most popular yacht 
makers with Japanese buyers are Bertram and Hatteras, two top-of-the-line U.S. 
yacht makers. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we sold about six yachts for about $2.5 million (total) to the 
Japanese," said John Gerber, a yacht broker at Hatteras of California in 
Newport Beach. "This year, we've sold three yachts in excess of $2 million 
already. That does not include an order we just received for a 45-foot luxury 
yacht for $475,000." 
</P>
<P>
Reese Williams of Crow's Nest, a Bertram broker in San Diego, said the Japanese 
snapped up 50% of the new boats the company sold last year on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Japanese boat buyers are steering away from the East Coast 
and heading for West Coast brokers to reduce the cost of transporting the 
yachts to Japan, brokers said.

FAST-GROWING COST CARE INC. SOLD TO JOHN HANCOCK; 
</P>
<P>
MERGER: THE HUNTINGTON BEACH COMPANY'S ACQUISITION BY THE INSURANCE AND 
FINANCIAL GIANT HAS CREATED ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST COST-MANAGEMENT FIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Hancock Financial Services, the insurance and financial giant, said Monday 
that it has acquired Cost Care Inc., a Huntington Beach company that 
specializes in helping employers control fast-rising medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
Boston-based John Hancock said it will merge its own, smaller health-care 
management business into Cost Care, creating one of the nation's largest 
cost-management firms with projected revenue of about $40 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Hancock and Cost Care would not disclose financial terms of the 
transaction. Hancock purchased the Huntington Beach firm from a management team 
led by Lawrence Goelman, chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Goelman recalled Monday that he founded the company "nine years ago with 
myself, a physician and a secretary." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Cost Care has grown into a major "utilization-review" firm with 360 
employees and a roster of 6,000 employer clients representing 3.25 million 
employees and their families. Its customers include such major national firms 
as Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., Champion International Corp. 
and Colgate-Palmolive Co. 
</P>
<P>
Cost Care also has a very large and computerized management-information system 
in Huntington Beach that monitors patients and health-care services. 
</P>
<P>
The company helps employers put a check on rising medical costs by monitoring 
medical care to prevent overuse of hospitals and other medical services, and by 
directing patients toward what it considers the most cost-effective treatment 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Goelman, who was the majority owner of Cost Care, said he decided to sell the 
firm to John Hancock so that Cost Care could obtain the capital, increased 
visibility and access to new customers it needs to continue its fast-paced 
growth. In the last nine years, he said, the company's revenues have increased 
at a 40% annual average. 
</P>
<P>
William E. Caulfield, senior vice president of group benefit services for John 
Hancock, said the Boston firm bought Cost Care to increase its managed care 
business and expertise in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Caulfield said that Cost Care has gained a reputation for its innovative 
screening system, which includes using physicians rather than nurses to review 
all cases. 
</P>
<P>
"What attracted us to Cost Care is its outstanding management, business 
strategy, and the strength and effectiveness of its customer service," he said. 
"It is the industry model for helping customers control health-care expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Caulfield noted that medical costs "continue to rise at more than double the 
rate of inflation and at current projected levels, by the year 2000, the 
nation's annual health bill will exceed $1.5 trillion. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, bold and innovative steps are required by health-care providers, 
employers, the benefits industry and consumers to help stem the tide of rising 
health-care costs," he said. "The acquisition of Cost Care is a major step by 
John Hancock toward that goal." 
</P>
<P>
Caulfield said that after the acquisition, Cost Care will retain its identity 
and continue to be run by Goelman and the rest of the former management team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you are seeing is people who really control the business -- the 
insurance carriers -- are buying the expertise they don't have in managed 
care," said Dr. Tom Mayer, a Los Angeles employee- benefits consultant. "As 
long as they don't screw it up, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Goelman said that he and about a dozen other senior Cost Care executives have 
agreed to remain with the firm for at least five years under contracts that tie 
their compensation to corporate performance. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Hancock) want us to run the company as we have in the past," Goelman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After John Hancock's own smaller utilization-review operation is transferred to 
Cost Care over the next few months, Cost Care will have 500 employees and 7,500 
corporate clients serving more than 5 million employees and their families. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be one of the top five (utilization-review) companies in the country" 
based on annual revenue, Goelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its former medical review centers in Huntington Beach and Atlanta, Cost 
Care will have additional centers in Chicago and Boston. Goelman said 
managed-health care is an industry in the midst of consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole managed-care industry is going to consolidate because of the 
tremendous amount of investment it takes to build networks and software 
packages needed to understand what is driving health-care costs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The managed-care business is becoming increasingly complicated, he added. Once, 
cost containment focused simply on minimizing hospital stays, he said, but now 
there is a call for more cost-effective treatment for mental illness and 
substance abuse, and for controls on outpatient services and the use of 
high-tech equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Goelman said Cost Care's former owners rejected the option of selling stock to 
the public to raise capital for expansion. "We want to grow and we don't want 
to be as concerned about maximizing our profits as about meeting our growth 
goals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To compete nationally, Goelman said, a utilization-review company needs at 
least 5 million customers to give it "enough visibility in the marketplace." 
Cost Care gains visibility by linking up with the giant Boston insurance firm, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to double the size of the company in the next five years. And we 
can't do that without help," he added.

SPECIALISTS ASSIST GLOBAL FLOW OF MONEY; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE JOB OF FINALIZING AGREEMENTS AND THEN TRANSFERRING SECURITIES IS 
HIGHLY SPECIALIZED AND ALSO A MONEYMAKER.

<TEXT>
<P>
It has become commonplace to speak of global capital flows as though the 
billions upon billions shuffling around the planet around the clock were 
dispatched at the merest touch of a button. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Ricca knows it's not always that easy. 
</P>
<P>
As president of Sequor Group, a division of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific 
National Bank, Ricca is one of an increasingly specialized breed of financial 
professionals who enable capital to roam the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Their business is clearing and settlement -- the timely completion of complex 
transactions, most often involving institutional investors and government 
securities, across borders, time zones and currencies. Clearance -- when the 
buyer pays the seller -- and settlement -- when the seller transfers securities 
to the buyer -- are what make global markets possible. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't buy and sell to your heart's content in money markets without being 
mindful of how you're going to settle the transactions," said Ricca, who 
conveys a technician's appreciation of the world markets machine. 
</P>
<P>
"If you could trade and settle simultaneously, at the push of a button, the 
amount of transactions that could be done is staggering," he said. "Trading is 
gated by the ability to settle a transaction." 
</P>
<P>
Burgeoning global financial activity, not only in New York, Tokyo, London and 
other centers, but in emerging markets in Singapore, Manila and Kuala Lumpur 
and elsewhere, has made settlement critical. Deals aren't done until they're 
done with finality -- market parlance for cash in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Though not the settlement leader, Sequor illustrates how global office services 
-- clearance, instrument transferal and safekeeping, foreign exchange money 
conversion and movement -- are now banking profit centers. 
</P>
<P>
Sequor's parent doesn't release the unit's results. But Sequor spokesman 
Patrick Scorese said the group, created in 1989 when the bank combined five 
processing areas, accounts for roughly 10% of the holding company's 1989 
earnings of $740.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major contributor, there's no doubt," said Robert Manheimer, a Sequor 
managing director and president of Security Pacific International Bank, the 
group's foreign exchange and trade financing arm. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, moving money was merely an accommodation," Manheimer said. "There 
weren't specific prices charged . . . it was a different world." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, "there's been a tremendous growth in the number of transactions 
that have to be settled. Banks realize that this is a good business and their 
attention has been focused on this." 
</P>
<P>
"It's something everybody is talking about a lot," said banking management 
consultant Steve Runan of McKinsey &amp; Co. "They're paying more attention to 
it because it's a fee-based revenue generator." 
</P>
<P>
He offered the caveat, though, that the heavy investment in technology needed 
to succeed may limit the ranks of profitable players. 
</P>
<P>
Most major U.S. banks engage in settlement, but some institutions, including 
Manufacturers Hanover and Chase Manhattan Bank, have begun to bundle and more 
aggressively market such processing services. Revenues from them are all the 
more important in a time when banks, just getting past the 1980s Third World 
debt debacle, face a new fiasco in real estate lending. 
</P>
<P>
A rough gauge of activity is message volume in the Clearing House Interbank 
Payments System, or Chips, in New York, the primary U.S. network for settling 
foreign exchange and money market transactions. Chips volume leaders in 1989 
were Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust, Manufacturers Hanover, J.P. 
Morgan, Bank of New York and Chemical Bank.

FLORIDA FLAP HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON ORANGE COUNTY SALES OF ALBUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While rap group 2 Live Crew continues to generate charges of obscenity in 
Broward County, Fla. -- culminating in the arrest of two band members after a 
performance early Sunday -- the controversy does not seem to have touched 
Orange County's record retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Several stores contacted Monday by The Times reported that they have received 
no complaints from customers and noted little or no effect on sales of the 
album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be," which was declared obscene Wednesday by a 
federal judge in south Florida. On Friday, Broward authorities arrested record 
store owner Charles Freeman for selling the recording to an undercover deputy 
sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Several Orange County retailers said that sales of the album have remained 
steady in the wake of the Florida controversy, even though some observers have 
predicted that the actions in Florida would boost sales of the album. 
</P>
<P>
"2 Live Crew is a pretty big name for the rappers," said Tom Erbentraut, 
manager of Music Plus in Santa Ana. "The album has been out for a while, so I 
don't think it's going to have any effect on sales." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Sather, assistant manager of Wherehouse Records in South Coast Plaza, 
agreed: "I can see that if it was a new album, sales would be going up." 
</P>
<P>
At Tower Records in El Toro, however, manager Robert Stapleton has detected 
"more of an interest" in the album in the past several days. 
</P>
<P>
Tower sells both versions of the album: "As Nasty as They Wanna Be," which 
carries a warning sticker; and a tamer version of the album, "As Clean as They 
Wanna Be." "As usual," Stapleton said, "the one with the warning sticker 
outsells the one without it." 
</P>
<P>
Some record chains, including Tower, will not sell "Nasty" to anyone under 18. 
In March, Musicland -- the nation's largest chain of record stores -- pulled 
the record entirely from its shelves, selling only the cleaned-up version. The 
chain operates several Musicland and Sam Goody outlets in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Phelps of the American Civil Liberties Union in Orange County said her 
office "always monitors local conditions" and has not heard of any attempts to 
censor the album in Orange County -- "but that doesn't mean we won't," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, 2 Live Crew leader and producer Luther Campbell, 29, and band 
member Chris Won Wong, 21, were stopped early Sunday by Broward County 
sheriff's deputies after an adults-only performance in Hollywood, Fla., and 
charged with first-degree misdemeanors. They were given notices to appear in 
court at a date to be determined later. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Florida authorities are preparing to charge a third band member, 
Mark Ross, with the same first-degree misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to 
a year in jail and a fine of $1,000.

A fire heavily damaged a spacious home in Woodland Hills this morning, causing 
an estimated $500,000 in damages but leaving residents unharmed, the Los 
Angeles Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter was treated for exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 4:22 a.m. in the two-story, 4,500-square-foot home in 
the 4400 block of Da Vinci Avenue, just south of Mulholland Drive, Fire 
Department spokesman Jim Wells said. Wells said an unknown number of residents 
escaped uninjured from the home.

<P>
Investigators believe the fire started in the garage and then spread through 
the attic. The cause of the fire is not known and is under investigation, Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters an hour to extinguish the flames.

A 19-year-old undocumented alien was killed after he was struck by a car when 
he and a friend tried to cross the northbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway 
this morning in San Clemente, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Carlos Sotelo, who lived in Fullerton, was thrown about 50 feet after he 
was hit by the car south of Avenida Pico. 
</P>
<P>
Sotelo was pronounced dead on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
His friend, Pedro Valderano, 25, also of Fullerton, was not struck and escaped 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Peter Mann said the two men were attempting to cross the freeway 
about 4:25 a.m. They had reached the fast lane when they realized that a car 
traveling about 60 m.p.h. was heading toward them, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver changed lanes to avoid hitting them, but the two men tried to run 
to the right shoulder," Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said no citations were issued and an investigation is under way. The CHP 
officer said Valderano reported that he and his friend were heading back home 
to Fullerton. "But where they were coming from at that time of the morning, we 
don't know," Mann said.

Nepal, the world's only Hindu kingdom, will free all Christian prisoners who 
were jailed by the former government for illegal proselytizing, the royal 
palace said today. 
</P>
<P>
The palace said in a statement King Birendra has "granted amnesty to all 
religious prisoners" on the advice of Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai 
in view of the "new political environment . . . in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 29 Christians, including 14 children younger than age 18, are 
serving sentences for proselytizing. There are no religious prisoners of other 
faiths. A human rights report recently said 144 other Christians are in police 
custody across the country facing trial.

Israeli soldiers today threw a tear gas grenade into a crowded waiting room of 
a U.N. maternity clinic in occupied Gaza City, injuring 66 Palestinian 
children, most of them babies, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
An official military source said the incident occurred when an army patrol 
"encountered massive throwing of stones and building blocks from inside the 
U.N. clinic." 
</P>
<P>
The source said that the soldiers acted contrary to orders and that the Israeli 
military commander in Gaza had ordered legal steps against those involved. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said six or seven soldiers in plainclothes chased stone-throwing Arab 
youths into the U.N. Relief and Works Agency Swedish Health Center and burst 
into a waiting room for pregnant women and a room where infants were being 
vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
They said the soldiers threw three tear gas grenades in the courtyard of the 
clinic. An UNRWA spokeswoman said between 100 and 200 women and children were 
in the center at the time. 
</P>
<P>
UNRWA international staff eventually intervened and persuaded the soldiers to 
withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight infants were treated for tear gas inhalation at the nearby Nasr 
Children's Hospital.

Students formed a human chain around Sofia University today and declared a 
strike over alleged government manipulation of what were billed as Bulgaria's 
first free elections in 58 years. 
</P>
<P>
The long-ruling Communists, who have renamed themselves the Socialist Party as 
they strive to break with a repressive past, appeared headed for a decisive 
victory in Sunday's elections. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 16-party Union of Democratic Forces claim a series of election 
irregularities affected the outcome of Sunday's first round of balloting. 
</P>
<P>
They rejected the Socialists' offer to join a governing coalition, and about 
60,000 opposition supporters staged a protest rally Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Down with the Red Mafia" and "We won't work for the Reds," they shouted. 
Today, demonstrations forced the closure of several downtown roads.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III, weighing a decision to end U.S. dialogue 
with the Palestine Liberation Organization, told a Senate committee today that 
an "extraordinary number of friendly countries" have urged him to avoid an 
abrupt end to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Baker said he was 
"hopeful, but not optimistic" that the PLO would come back with the right 
responses to permit the dialogue with the United States to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the U.S. ambassador told the PLO representative in Tunis on May 31 
that the United States wants three things from the PLO in the wake of the 
abortive speedboat attack on a beachfront near Tel Aviv last month: a direct 
condemnation of the attack, a disassociation of the PLO leadership from the act 
and "to begin to take steps" to discipline Abul Abbas, leader of a splinter 
Palestinian group, "to show that the PLO doesn't countenance such acts."

Italy bowed to a worldwide protest campaign today and withdrew Venice as a 
candidate to host the Expo 2000 World Fair. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced to Parliament by Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti two 
days before a Paris-based organization meets to choose Venice, Toronto or 
Hanover, Germany, to host the fair. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Italian politicians and Venice lovers around the world have said 
the ancient canal city would collapse under the strain of hosting hundreds of 
thousands of extra tourists if the Expo 2000 were staged there. 
</P>
<P>
Andreotti told the Senate that the government "has reached the conviction not 
to confirm to the International Exhibitions Office the candidacy of Venice as a 
site for Expo 2000." 
</P>
<P>
A motion asking the government to withdraw support for Venice was due to have 
been debated by both houses of Parliament on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition at home and abroad, the Italian government, enthusiastically 
backed by big business, had until now maintained its bid for Venice as the star 
attraction of a regionwide Expo 2000.

Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' joke about a bomb on a USAir plane and a White House 
aide could have landed the 1988 Democratic presidential candidate in trouble 
with airport security. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis was boarding a USAir flight from Logan International Airport to 
Washington on Sunday evening when he spotted White House aide and political foe 
Ron Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
According to WBZ-TV in Boston, Dukakis reportedly joked about checking Kaufman 
and his baggage for a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Such remarks about airline safety, even in jest, are prohibited by federal law 
and should be reported to authorities, a Federal Aviation Administration 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He apparently made some comment that caused the USAir agent to check with his 
supervisor to see if security should be notified," said USAir spokesman Dave 
Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
Shipley said the supervisor recognized the governor and let him go. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an error in judgment," Shipley said. "He should have been detained 
and questioned if in fact he made some remark" about carrying a bomb.

Chrysler Corp. and the French auto maker Renault announced today that they have 
abandoned their joint venture in developing and building a new sport-utility 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The ARCAD joint venture, formed in February, 1989, "is no longer economically 
attractive," the auto makers said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
ARCAD was to begin producing a vehicle code-named "JJ" in the second half of 
1992 at a Valladolid, Spain, plant leased from Renault's Spanish subsidiary. 
The four-wheel-drive vehicles were to be marketed worldwide except in North 
America, where ARCAD planned to build them at an existing Chrysler facility. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler intends to develop the JJ project on its own, but a North American 
plant still has not been selected, Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
Renault will continue distributing Chrysler's Jeep vehicles in Europe, the 
statement said.

The makers of Crayola crayons, responding to the bolder, brighter tastes of 
children, said today that they are retiring eight standard colors and 
introducing eight new ones with snazzy names such as dandelion, cerulean and 
wild strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for the new hues, Binney &amp; Smith Inc. is eliminating eight old 
favorites: maize, raw umber, blue gray, lemon yellow, green blue, orange red, 
orange yellow and violet blue. 
</P>
<P>
But starting next month, children around the world will be able to draw a teal 
blue ocean, a fuchsia azalea, a dandelion sun, a jungle green tree, a vivid 
tangerine tiger, a royal purple king's cloak, a cerulean (bright medium blue) 
sky and a wild strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Binney &amp; Smith has stopped production of any color and 
the first time since 1972, when eight fluorescent shades came on the market, 
that any new colors have been introduced.

Japan said today that it is willing to resume loans to Peru if the South 
American nation's new government shows willingness to deal with its serious 
economic and social problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ancestry of Peru's new president, Alberto Fujimori, has raised 
hopes of greater access to Japanese aid. Fujimori said Monday that he hopes to 
visit Tokyo before his scheduled July 28 inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Peru was the largest recipient of Japanese aid in Latin America in cumulative 
terms until 1988, but dropped to fourth largest after it defaulted on payments 
and Japan cut off its yen credits. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori faces widespread unemployment, a 2,000% inflation rate, terrorism and

CBS' '48 HRS.' MAKES TOP 10 FOR FIRST TIME;

The CBS News program "48 Hours" made the top 10 for the first time last week -- 
one of two CBS News shows in that elite group -- as NBC won the ratings race 
but CBS edged out ABC for No. 2, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Missing from the top 10 was ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos," which was 
in a four-way tie for 15th place. The show was competing against regular 
programming and did win its time period. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's "The Simpsons" also dropped out of the top 10, after becoming the first 
Fox show ever to earn that distinction the previous week. "The Simpsons" has 
been said to benefit from an audience switch-over from "Home Videos," but last 
week it outranked the earlier show, finishing in 13th place. 
</P>
<P>
The winning "48 Hours," which ranked 10th, joined "60 Minutes," tied for 
seventh on the Nielsen list. It was a special outing for the show -- at 10-11 
p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday -- and it told the moving story of a missing 
child in "The Search for Matthew." 
</P>
<P>
The big difference for "48 Hours" was not having to compete against "The Cosby 
Show" and "A Different World" on NBC. The regular "48 Hours" program on 
Thursday night finished in a tie for 58th. 
</P>
<P>
The best "48 Hours" has done in the past is rank 12th with its program on 
Hurricane Gilbert in September, 1988 -- but it still was second in its time 
period against "Cosby." 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, the show will move to a new time period, away from Big Bill, but 
the competition won't exactly be chopped liver. "48 Hours" is scheduled to move 
to Saturday nights at 10, where it will compete with "Twin Peaks" on ABC and 
"Carol &amp; Company" and Robert Urich's new "American Dreamer" on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pretty good week for ABC News shows, too, with "20/20" in 14th place 
and "PrimeTime Live" tied for 28th. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday movie contest went to CBS, which tied for 15th with "Trouble in 
Paradise." NBC's showing of "Gremlins" tied for 33rd, while ABC's "Prizzi's 
Honor" tied for 63rd. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the week ending June 10 with a 10.8 rating and a 20 share. CBS edged 
out ABC for second with a 9.8 rating and a 19 share, while ABC had a 9.7 rating 
and an 18 share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP 10 SHOWS 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 programs for the week ending Sunday, June 10, according to the A.C. 
Nielsen Co., were:

<P>

"Adam Smith's Money World," public television's weekly look at business, will 
run this fall on Soviet television, dubbed in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
"Adam Smith has come to the land of Karl Marx," said the show's host, George J. 
W. Goodman, who uses the name of the 18th-Century Scottish economist who 
outlined the workings of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Co Star, a Soviet company that produces and distributes films, will get the 
broadcast rights to "Money World" and sell advertising to U.S. companies doing 
business in the Soviet Union. Those companies include General Motors and 
AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the show's U.S. producers will get technical support for a public TV 
special on perestroika and glasnost.

TOP ROYAL OPERA TICKETS ABOVE $170

Top ticket prices at the Royal Opera House will exceed $170 for the first time 
next season, the financially struggling company says. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in September, opera tickets at the theater in Covent Garden will jump 
on average by 17% while ballet seats will rise 25%. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to raise prices comes as the theater struggles with an accumulated 
deficit of about $8.5 million. The company projects a deficit of $3.4 million 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in a perfect world our ticket prices would have to rise to keep pace with 
inflation," said Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the Royal Opera House. "We 
have taken these steps with reluctance in order to sustain rather than reduce 
our service to our audiences." 
</P>
<P>
Prices for 12 of the 126 upcoming opera performances will range from $5 for 
seats in the upper balcony, to $172 for the house's best seats. The most 
expensive ticket last season was $153.

HOAX AGAINST TAYLOR FIT PATTERN, PUBLICIST SAYS

The 23-year-old Michigan man who gained national publicity in a hoax that 
linked him romantically with Elizabeth Taylor is an aspiring actor who 
previously has tried to plant false stories about his career, Taylor's 
publicist said today. 
</P>
<P>
Chen Sam, Taylor's spokeswoman, said Julian Lee Hobbs, a high school dropout 
from Lake Orion, Mich., was the focus of the weekend hoax engineered by a woman 
who used a secret code to intercept Sam's answering service. 
</P>
<P>
No one so far has stepped forward to take responsibility for the hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs' attorney was quoted by the Detroit News today as saying his client had 
never met the Oscar-winning actress. His stepmother told the newspaper, "He 
likes to create his own publicity." 
</P>
<P>
The hoaxer called Sam's answering service and used a secret code to identify 
herself as an employee, calling herself Lisa Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
She returned phone calls from reporters and said Hobbs flew in from Detroit and 
spent the weekend at Taylor's side. 
</P>
<P>
Sam said Tuesday that Taylor, 58, was trying to ignore the story. "Her priority 
right now is to get well," she said, adding that her attorneys are conducting 
an investigation and trying to decide whether to pursue criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports in the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press, Hobbs left 
high school after his sophomore year and moved to the Los Angeles area, where 
he spread stories about his success as a rock singer and international model. 
</P>
<P>
Sam said today that in the course of tracking down the source of the story, she 
was told that Hobbs has tried to hoax journalists before. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my calls yesterday, I'd spoken to one or two journalists here in the 
United States in different cities," she said. "Two papers in Michigan said 
they'd interviewed him and, when they went to do their research, it turned out 
he hadn't done any work."

BOB VILA CLIMBS BACK UP TELEVISION'S LADDER

Bob Vila got kicked out of the "House" and decided to go "Home." 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, Vila was host of "This Old House," the highest-rated show on 
public television, teaching viewers home renovation and remodeling techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Then he was fired for making too many commercials. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, he'll be back on the job -- on commercial TV. 
</P>
<P>
"The new show is aptly named 'Home Again' because, in many ways, it puts me 
back on TV where I started 10, 11 years ago," Vila said from BVTV, his 
production company in Massachusetts. "I'm doing construction and remodeling 
stories that are relevant to the remodeling homeowner and home builder." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the case on the Emmy Award-winning "This Old House," which spared 
no expense when it undertook costly renovation projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With 15 million viewers, "This Old House" made Vila a celebrity among 
do-it-yourselfers. He cashed in with a string of TV commercials for Time-Life 
Books and various home improvement products. 
</P>
<P>
That grated on his show's corporate underwriters and on Boston's WGBH-TV, which 
produced the show. The underwriters saw Vila speaking for the competition. WGBH 
said Vila was hurting public TV's image. 
</P>
<P>
To put it kindly, he was nailed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough for me for three months," said Vila, who found a new sponsor in 
Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Home Again," syndicated by Group W, will air starting in September in 85% of 
the country, including on network affiliate stations in 24 of the top 25 
television markets. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as public television is concerned, I gave them 10 great years of my 
life," Vila said. "I feel like I've done my duty for public TV."

The Rev. Jesse Jackson says the biggest threat to the younger generation is not 
bigotry but weakness of character. 
</P>
<P>
He urged his daughter's ninth-grade class to shun drugs and seek out challenges 
to improve the world. 
</P>
<P>
"What does it matter if you have this opportunity to lead us into the next 
century and choose some flirtation or infatuation over using these precious 
moments to improve your mind?" Jackson asked graduating Fay School students 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"No, the great threat to your generation is not some ancient, archaic law, 
denying you access and information based upon race or sex or religion, but 
rather a challenge of character and the will to choose hope if you will over 
dope." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson waved his daughter's diploma in the air before handing it to her.

Jacqueline Lavinia Jackson was among 56 students who received diplomas from the 
private school.

CHRIS FORD CHOSEN AS COACH OF CELTICS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: HE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF COACHING STAFF RETAINED AFTER JIMMY 
RODGERS WAS FIRED MAY 8.

<P>
The Boston Celtics tapped Chris Ford as their new coach today, moving the 
longtime assistant coach of the club into the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials described Ford as "a guy who is truly a Celtic, a guy who has 
paid his dues." 
</P>
<P>
Ford told a news conference that he expects his tenure to be "a good time." 
</P>
<P>
He added, though, that it is "going to take a lot of hard work and dedication 
to get us back on top." 
</P>
<P>
He said he wants a team "that is going to play with fire, passion, emotion; 
that is going to have the work ethic that is going to put us on top." 
</P>
<P>
Ford, the only coach retained after Jimmy Rodgers was fired May 8, two days 
after the Celtics were eliminated from the NBA playoffs by the New York Knicks, 
had been considered the leading candidate. 
</P>
<P>
But Dave Gavitt, named May 30 as chief operating officer to handle basketball 
operations with the Celtics, had been in contact with Duke University Coach 
Mike Krzyzewski in recent weeks concerning the job. Krzyzewski informed Gavitt 
last Thursday that he was withdrawing his name from consideration to remain 
with the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, who played 10 seasons in the NBA for Detroit and Boston and who is 
credited with making the first three-point shot in the NBA on Oct. 12, 1979, 
was traded to the Celtics on Oct. 19, 1978, along with a draft selection for 
Earl Tatum. He was a member of Boston's 1981 championship team. 
</P>
<P>
He played one more season and then joined the Celtics coaching staff for the 
1983-84 season, where he has worked for K. C. Jones and Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, Detroit's second-round draft pick out of Villanova in 1972, was a member 
of championship teams in 1984 and 1986, joining K. C. Jones, Bill Russell and 
Tommy Heinsohn to be part of NBA titles in Boston as both a player and coach. 
The latter three were head coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, 41, becomes the Celtics' 11th coach, following in the footsteps of Red 
Auerbach, who coached the Celtics to nine NBA championships before moving to 
the front office after the 1966 season, Russell, Heinsohn, Dave Cowens, Bill 
Fitch and Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Ford attended the NBA college tryout camp in Chicago last week and has also 
taken part in just about every scouting meeting as the Celtics prepare for the 
NBA draft later this month.

Athletic directors at Arkansas, Florida State and Miami say their schools would 
consider joining the Southeastern Conference if the league extended an 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
The schools have agreed to be placed under consideration for acceptance, the 
athletic directors said. 
</P>
<P>
Conference Commissioner Roy Kramer said the 10-team SEC, whose presidents 
unanimously voted to explore expansion two weeks ago, is only in the 
preliminary process of determining which schools might be interested. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer would not discuss the candidates and said there is no timetable for when 
the SEC might extend formal bids to join. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer and athletic directors from across the nation were attending the 
National Assn. of Collegiate Directors of Athletics convention, which continues 
through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think realignment (of major conferences) is inevitable," Louisiana State 
Athletic Director Joe Dean said Monday. "This is somewhat of a 
television-driven thing." 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas has been in the Southwest Conference for 76 years. Florida State is an 
independent in football and a Metro Conference member in other sports. Miami is 
an independent in all sports. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few schools that can make it as an independent," Miami Athletic 
Director Sam Jankovich said. "We can make it as an independent. But you have to 
look at what is down the road 10 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Should Arkansas join, it might open the door for SWC brethren Texas and Texas 
A&amp;M to be considered by the SEC. Texas' big television market is attractive 
to the SEC.

Former Dodgers relief ace Steve Howe, in the middle of another baseball 
comeback, has been hospitalized with a blood clot in his lung. 
</P>
<P>
Howe's condition was upgraded to satisfactory and he was transferred from the 
critical care unit to the regular nursing area Monday afternoon, said Frankie 
Edwards, director of public relations at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
June Snow, administrative assistant at the hospital, said after Howe was 
hospitalized that he was receiving an anticoagulant in an attempt to dissolve 
the clot. 
</P>
<P>
Howe was pitching for the Salinas Spurs of the Class A California League. Howe, 
0-1, hadn't allowed an earned run in nine innings while striking out 10 and 
walking two. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything depends on if the anticoagulant works," Salinas General Manager 
John Jonas told the Antelope Valley Press. "Surgery may be required if it 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
If surgery is required, Howe's career "may be on the line," Jonas said. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, 32, was taken to the hospital Saturday afternoon and admitted in serious 
condition. He was in Antelope Valley to speak to junior high students about the 
dangers of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, the National League rookie of the year in 1980, faced a series of 
suspensions for cocaine use, the first in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have refused to comment if Howe's current ailment had any connection 
with his previous drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Howe was released by the Dodgers in 1985. In 1986, Howe attempted a comeback 
with the San Jose Bees of the California League, and then signed with the Texas 
Rangers. Texas paid a $250,000 penalty in order to promote Howe to its 
major-league roster in spite of Howe's lifetime ban. 
</P>
<P>
Howe later violated his Texas contract on a non-drug-related matter and was 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Howe published his autobiography, "Between the Lines," in 1989. He has been an 
active speaker on the dangers of drug use.

and if we lose the next two games we'll go home and at Kennedy Airport people 
won't know who we are anyway." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time to shine," goalkeeper Tony Meola said. "We had one try, we 
didn't do it. This is our second try. We've got three tries to shock the world. 
This is number two here."

Spectacular second-half goals by Marc Degryse and Michel De Wolf earned Belgium 
a 2-0 victory today over South Korea in the opening games for both countries in 
the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Striker Degryse scored the first in the 52nd minute when he collected a long 
pass from Enzo Scifo 30 yards out and lobbed the ball high over goalkeeper Choi 
In Young, who had advanced well out of his goal area. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve minutes later, left back De Wolf added the second, finishing a solo run 
with a scorching drive from outside the area for one of the best goals of the 
tournament so far. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian's experienced defense kept the South Koreans in check. 
</P>
<P>
It took well over an hour before South Korea could even get its first shot on 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Belgians found it hard to break down the packed Korean defense in the first 
half, although they came close several times, and midfielder Bruno Versavel hit 
the post in the seventh minute. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea, outsiders in probably the toughest group of the tournament, which 
also includes Spain and Uruguay, made occasional breaks, with Choi Soon Ho 
looking most threatening on a field made slippery by rain. 
</P>
<P>
Belgium, surprise semifinalists in the 1986 Mexico tournament, put South Korea 
under early pressure through Marc Emmers, who broke down the right wing several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Acrobatic goalkeeper Choi was the outstanding member of the team, saving his 
side from a much greater defeat as the Belgians rained shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
Belgium slowed the pace after their second goal, but South Korea, which failed 
to survive the first round in two previous World Cup appearances, had its best 
chance when Hwang Seon Hong's header was snatched away by goalkeeper Michel 
Preud'homme. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is the two points," Guy Thys, Belgium's veteran 
coach, said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a well-deserved, routine victory, although I would have liked 
to have seen two more goals," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to start the second half as they had the first, and this time we 
managed to score."

5 GERMAN FANS GIVEN 2 YEARS IN SOCCER BRAWL

<P>
Five German fans were sentenced to two years in prison today for their 
participation in the violence preceding Sunday's West Germany-Yugoslavia World 
Cup match. 
</P>
<P>
They were released on bail but ordered to stay away from the 12 Italian cities 
playing host to World Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
The charges -- including resisting arrest, causing bodily injury and vandalism 
-- resulted from clashes that began when the Germans throwing rocks, 
firecrackers and bottles attacked a group of Yugoslavs waving their flag on the 
steps of the Duomo, Milan's spire-topped cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
It took police using batons and tear gas more than two hours to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimated that 1,000 Germans were involved in the clashes and in a 
window-smashing and looting rampage through the center of the city. Italian 
newspapers said the 30 injured included police, fans and passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
Forty German and four German-speaking Swiss soccer fans were expelled from the 
country, 14 others were arrested, and four more were issued citations and 
ordered to leave Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities blamed alcohol use for much of the rampage. Milan had banned the 
sale and serving of alcohol for the day of the game, but many fans had beer 
bottles in their cars, apparently purchased outside Milan or brought into Italy 
from their home country.

ARMSTRONG REACHES A GOAL JUST BY STEPPING ON THE FIELD

That his team took a 5-1 beating did not really matter. Well, it mattered, but 
not as much as you might think. Neither did it really matter that his own 
performance Sunday was one of his worst in months. It was the World Cup finals. 
He was on the field. Desmond Armstrong would not trade the moment for a free 
villa in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
Just playing in the Cup finals, being one of the first Americans in 40 years to 
do so -- that in itself is a victory, see, and you take victories of any kind 
when you grow up in the United States putting soccer posters on your wall, 
which means your friends think you are a little strange. 
</P>
<P>
That all goes double if you are black and gifted with strong legs, and the 
people in your neighborhood call you names and wonder out loud why you are 
wasting your time with a round ball that does not go in a basket. 
</P>
<P>
"Oreo cookie, that's what the black community called me," said Armstrong, who 
went to Howard High School and the University of Maryland. "Soccer was for 
white people, they said. It was a pretty good psychological jolt for a kid. I 
was 12." 
</P>
<P>
His family had chased the American dream, moving out from southwest Washington 
to Hyattsville, Md., Wheaton, Md., and finally to Columbia, Md., when he was 
14. Armstrong, now 25, was at a friend's house playing basketball one day after 
school, and the friend's father, a soccer coach, noticed him. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me I was a pretty good athlete and ought to try soccer," Armstrong 
said. "I didn't even know what it was. Had never heard of it. This was when we 
were in Wheaton. I was terrible the first year. All I could do was run. Then we 
moved to Columbia and all the kids were playing and I started getting the hang 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
He was among the nation's elite by the time he was a high school senior, good 
enough to play in the Olympic Festival. But there were few blacks on his teams. 
Soccer is the poor man's game around the world, but it is a suburban sport in 
the United States. He stood out. "Almost every hour," he said, someone would 
ask when he planned to stop fooling around and play a real sport. It was enough 
to make a young man think twice. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fact that if you are a talented black athlete in the U.S., people 
think you should play basketball," he said. "I've dealt with that all my life, 
heard it over and over and over. But I just stuck it out. I loved my game." 
</P>
<P>
That he did was evident, for he was not showered with rewards for being so 
accomplished. His high school and college teams were "failures," he said. Not 
until the summer of 1987, when he played on a team that won the U.S. Soccer 
Federation's National Amateur Cup, did he win anything substantial. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you all about losing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That summer, the Cleveland Force selected him in the first round of the Major 
Indoor Soccer League draft. He signed a contract and played well, but his mind 
often was elsewhere, looking ahead to the Olympics in South Korea, where he 
played on a U.S. team that had two ties and a loss in three games. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Baltimore Blast when he came back, a fine homecoming, but his 
heart still beat the strongest for the outdoor game. 
</P>
<P>
Then his world crashed. He shattered his right leg during a Blast game. "It was 
the hardest part of all," he said. "You don't really know if you'll ever be the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
It took him nine months of rehabilitation to get back on the field, another 
five months to rediscover his game. The U.S. team qualified for the World Cup 
in the interim. Armstrong regained his starting place on the U.S. squad in the 
months leading up to the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
He played all 90 minutes in Sunday's 5-1 loss to the Czechs, and although he 
was outrun, turned around and caught out of position a few times, his man did 
not score. Still, he had hoped to use the Cup to impress a European team enough 
to sign a contract. Teams in the Netherlands and France had expressed some 
interest. "This won't help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He is at a crossroads at 25. "If I don't get to Europe off this, my career is 
basically over," he said. "I would love to play two or three years over here. 
Otherwise, you're looking at going back to the U.S. and making a living playing 
indoors. I'd probably be in law school by 1995." 
</P>
<P>
Like many American soccer players, he has a pioneer's heart. "I just hope there 
are some young black kids who see me and decide to try soccer," he said. "Maybe 
they'll start earlier than I did."

THE ASTROPHYSICIST AND HIS WIFE ARE LIVING IN THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BEIJING. HIS 
LETTERS ABROAD OFFER DETAILS OF THEIR LIFE IN POLITIAL EXILE.

<P>
In effect, they are hostages and political exiles marooned on a tiny American 
island amid a churning Chinese ocean. American diplomats have privately dubbed 
them "the guests," or sometimes, "the furniture." 
</P>
<P>
He is China's leading dissident, Fang Lizhi, and she is his wife, Li Shuxian. 
And they've spent the last year, since soon after the bloodletting around Tian 
An Men Square last June, in the American Embassy in Beijing, waiting for 
statesmen to negotiate their future. 
</P>
<P>
Fang dispatches frequent letters to his friends and relatives overseas from his 
temporary home. 
</P>
<P>
He often writes on a computer, apparently supplied by the embassy, that has 
both English and Chinese word-processing software. His letters are full of 
humor, but also, occasionally, touches of frustration and melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an astrophysicist, and yet I cannot see the sky," Fang complained to one 
Princeton University scientist. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Fang's friends send him not only letters but voluminous reading 
matter. Fellow scientists from around the world send Fang professional journals 
and texts. Supporters of China's pro-democracy movement send him news clippings 
and political material -- particularly the work of Soviet and East European 
intellectuals who, like Fang, challenged the Communist system. 
</P>
<P>
Fang's mailbag recently included Chinese-language translations of the famous 
1978 essay "The Power of the Powerless" by Czechoslovakia's 
dissident-turned-president Vaclav Havel, and a separate article by Polish 
dissident Adam Michnik. American writer Orville Schell sent Fang a transcript 
of the court proceedings against another famous scientist-dissident, Galileo. 
</P>
<P>
As one of China's leading physicists, and as a senior administrator at the 
Chinese University of Science and Technology, Fang was once a ranking and 
well-rewarded member of the Communist Party he now so eloquently criticizes. He 
was expelled in 1987 after encouraging students at his school to organize 
demonstrations for democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Those demonstrations in 1986 and 1987 turned out to be precursors of the 
upheavals at Tian An Men Square last spring. And three days after the People's 
Liberation Army crushed the Beijing demonstrations, Fang and his wife, Li, 
denounced by the Chinese regime as traitors and counterrevolutionaries, sought 
safety inside the American Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
They have been there since -- unable to leave, surrounded by watchful Chinese 
police on the streets outside. 
</P>
<P>
Obscured from the outside world, Fang and Li nevertheless have remained at or 
near the center of attention in the fitful efforts at reconciliation between 
the Bush Administration and the Chinese regime of senior leader Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
The American sheltering of Fang was one of the principal factors behind an 
outpouring of anti-Americanism by the Chinese regime last summer. Negotiating 
Fang's release is believed to have been one of the top items on the agenda when 
Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, made his 
controversial trip to Beijing last December. And China's failure to let Fang go 
was one of the main reasons that Bush said earlier this year that he had been 
disappointed by China's failure to respond to his overtures. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that the couple may be allowed to leave the embassy -- perhaps 
even within the next few weeks. The broad outlines of a deal to accomplish 
their release are easy to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Bush Administration would like to end the standoff and have 
China allow Fang and Li to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese regime would like to regain its access to hundreds of millions of 
dollars in loans from the World Bank and the Japanese government -- loans that 
were frozen largely because of pressure from the United States. The blocked 
loans to China are expected to be on the agenda at the economic summit of 
leading industrial nations in Houston next month, and Fang's release might 
cause Bush to clear the way for the loans. 
</P>
<P>
But past efforts to work out a deal have failed. Before Fang and his wife can 
be released, several sticking points need to be worked out: 
</P>
<P>
 * What kind of statement would Fang have to sign? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's offered to sign some document that tells the truth, but not to confess 
to things he hasn't done," says one U.S. supporter. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese regime may want Fang to admit to orchestrating last year's 
demonstrations. Fang stayed away from Tian An Men Square and denied that he 
played any major role in organizing the protests there. So far, there is no 
evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where would Fang go? 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese regime does not want Fang in France or the United States, the two 
centers of Chinese intellectuals and students pressing for democracy in their 
homeland. Once there, Fang would quickly emerge as a leader and unifying force 
for the now-fragmented opposition to the Chinese regime. 
</P>
<P>
Other countries, such as Italy and Australia, have been mentioned as possible 
new homes for Fang. Italy recently said he would be welcome there. 
</P>
<P>
 * What restrictions would be placed on Fang's ability to write or speak out on 
political matters while in exile? 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese authorities apparently have sought a deal in which Fang would be 
allowed to leave the country on condition that he refrain from all political 
activity. Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who remains close to 
Chinese leaders, once suggested that Fang be permitted to go overseas to pursue 
his scientific career, strongly implying that Fang would have to stick to 
science -- not politics. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the Bush Administration would accept such a deal, or, 
if so, how it could be enforced after Fang leaves China. 
</P>
<P>
 * Would Fang's son, Fang Zhi, be allowed to leave China with his parents? 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing might seek leverage over Fang's political conduct overseas by 
requiring that one of his two children remain in China. Fang and Li's younger 
son, Fang Zhi, fled into the U.S. Embassy with his parents a year ago, but then 
left the American compound last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Fang Zhi, who still lives in Beijing, has sought permission to travel to the 
United States, where he might join his older brother, Fang Ke. 
</P>
<P>
"They still will not give him a passport," Fang Ke, a graduate student in 
physics at Wayne State University in Michigan, told The Times last week. "It 
still seems impossible for him to leave." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials decline to provide details on Fang Lizhi's daily life inside the 
embassy. In turn, Fang, perhaps restrained by his American hosts, has said 
almost nothing in public about his confinement. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the extraordinary circumstances under which we now live, I am 
unable to tell you any of the details of our lives," he wrote in accepting the 
Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award last fall. Since January, Fang has written 
five articles for scientific journals, plus one for the magazine Omni. 
</P>
<P>
Those who correspond with Fang and Li say the long confinement appears to be 
harder on Li, who is herself a scientist, teacher and political activist. 
</P>
<P>
"Fang may be doing better than his wife," observes Schell. "His work is more 
cerebral. She is more of a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Friends also worry about the couple's isolation from Chinese society and 
culture. "They only have each other to speak Chinese with," says Princeton 
University professor Perry Link. (While some embassy officials speak Chinese, 
even they would tend to speak with the couple in English.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, their situation is not entirely gloomy. Fang has the opportunity to read 
and to think. In one recent letter to an American friend, he noted that he can 
obtain scholarly journals more quickly through the American Embassy than he 
ever could through the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Fang Ke, the couple's son in the United States, points out another benefit of 
their confinement: Living together under one roof. In a country where husbands 
and wifes are routinely assigned to jobs in different cities, that is not 
always the norm. 
</P>
<P>
His parents lived apart for more than 15 of the 30 years of their marriage, 
according to Fang Ke. Now, inside the U.S. Embassy, they have more of an 
American-style marriage. "My parents have been separated for a long time," said 
their son. "I feel that it's better for them to be together."
