ACCORD REACHED ON TEACHING TAGALOG IN SOUTHEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Filipino-American students at Bell Junior High School in Southeast San Diego 
will be able to take a second-year course in the Pilipino national language, 
Tagalog, this fall at nearby Morse High School, under a compromise reached 
Tuesday by San Diego city schools trustees. 
</P>
<P>
The board acted quickly to try to defuse a simmering dispute between the large 
Filipino community around the two schools and Morse Principal Virginia Foster, 
who had decided not to offer a continuation of the pilot first-year Tagalog 
course begun this school year at Bell. Most Bell students matriculate to Morse. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees accepted a proposal drawn up hastily Tuesday by schools Supt. Tom 
Payzant after a decision by almost 100 students and parents of the Filipino 
community to picket the school district's administration center and to press 
for a public hearing about their concerns. Under the plan, ninth-graders from 
Bell who took Tagalog this year will be eligible for a second-year course at 
Morse to be given at 7 a.m., an hour before school normally starts. The Bell 
teacher will head the course at Morse. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant also said that administrators will work with Bell and Morse principals 
and teachers to create a permanent Tagalog curriculum for possible 
implementation in the fall of 1990. But he also scolded some Filipino speakers 
for making Foster a major target of their anger, saying that she had had 
legitimate questions about setting up a second-year course and that Bell 
administrators shared blame for not talking earlier with their Morse 
counterparts about continuing the language study. 
</P>
<P>
Foster is black, and district administrators have acknowledged that there is 
black-Filipino community tension at several Southeast schools such as Bell and 
Morse, whose student populations have changed during the past decade from being 
predominantly black to having a Filipino plurality. 
</P>
<P>
Bell is 42% Filipino, 23% white, 17% Latino and 15% black. Morse is 33% 
Filipino, 29% black, 16% white and 15% Latino. The high school receives 
students both from Bell and from Keiller Middle School, which is 44% black. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Principal Joene Bruhn started the pilot course after several 
Filipino-American teachers and parents expressed interest in having their 
children learn their cultural language. Tagalog is accepted as a foreign 
language for college admission by the University of California and California 
State University systems, provided two or more years are completed 
satisfactorily at the secondary level. 
</P>
<P>
Although originally intended for all students at Bell no matter their grade 
level, Bruhn had to restrict enrollment to 40 ninth-graders because so many 
students wanted to study Tagalog, she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have filled two classes," Bruhn said. The priority for ninth-graders 
also created the problem leading to the tension that culminated at Tuesday's 
meeting, a point Payzant emphasized in his comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we assumed that Morse would be eager to start a (second-year) course 
for the students who would be in the 10th grade next fall," Bruhn said. "Maybe 
we didn't communicate as well as we should have to Morse." 
</P>
<P>
But Filipino community leaders said Tuesday that Foster expressed little 
interest in setting up such a course and raised many questions about the 
curriculum and about who would teach Tagalog, concerns that they saw as 
roadblocks. Foster did not return phone calls Tuesday or attend the board 
meeting, and several Filipino spokesmen complained that the principal was 
uncommunicative with them during the past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Cruz, a school district psychologist and former counselor at Bell, said 
that "the principal at Morse seems reluctant to start a course . . . she should 
have known that the kids would want the course, but the needs of the community 
are not being met. She is not sensitive to the needs of the Pilipino culture." 
</P>
<P>
However, several black parents active at Morse on Tuesday complained privately 
that Tagalog is not a legitimate language compared to Spanish, Japanese or 
French, which they believe are more attractive to students of all ethnicities. 
</P>
<P>
Both Payzant and school trustees disputed the assertion, saying that courses in 
Pilipino language and culture should attract more than just Filipino students, 
especially if they become a permanent part of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there could be a strong desire for such courses in the Mira Mesa area 
as well," board member Jim Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
But trustee Shirley Weber made a clear reference to concerns of black parents, 
saying, "I would hate to see us develop a curriculum that meets the needs of 
only a specific group . . . any language that we put in should be a language 
that everyone can learn . . . otherwise, we are being isolationist (that will) 
increase ethnic tension in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Kay Davis spoke for a majority of the board in saying that long-range 
plans will be drawn up during the upcoming year for a Tagalog curriculum. Davis 
said that Bell might want to offer first- and second-year Tagalog while Morse 
might offer three years of the language to strengthen student transcripts for 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Bruhn of Bell said she foresees second-year Tagalog at her school within a year 
or two. Beverly Foster, area superintendent for the Bell and Morse area (and no 
relation to Principal Foster), said Tuesday that Morse administrators "are 
receptive" to first- and second-year Tagalog at their school starting in the 
fall of 1990, which will allow more time for planning. 
</P>
<P>
"That will allow us to have the benefits from the model and will make it easier 
for non-Filipino students to have a chance to take the language as well," 
Beverly Foster said. She said also that the Morse principal probably did not 
consider Tagalog a "high priority" for this fall because of the need to 
implement the district's new core curriculum on a schoolwide basis next year. 
</P>
<P>
That core curriculum will require all students to take college-preparatory 
English, math/science and social studies courses to improve the overall level 
of high school study. It is forcing principals at all secondary schools to be 
more selective about what elective courses are offered in language and fine 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, let's face it, nobody likes to be pressured into offering a particular 
course," Beverly Foster said, "and this got caught up in community tensions."

RESEARCH ON MOLECULAR BONDING WINS MAJOR HONORS; 
</P>
<P>
EGYPTIAN SCIENTIST RIDING A FAST TRACK AT CALTECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The speed of everything around him, compared to life in his native Egypt, 
stunned Ahmed Zewail the moment he landed in America. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for five minutes I just had to stand there and absorb this whole new 
culture," the Caltech professor of chemical physics said of that moment 20 
years ago in a Philadelphia airport. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with one major honor following another, Zewail is receiving international 
recognition for recording the formation and breaking of molecular bonds, a 
phenomenon that takes place so fast many scientists thought it could never be 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
Zewail's career is on a fast track. This spring, at the age of 43, he was named 
to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, whose members are usually in 
their mid-50s when they are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Academy membership came right on the heels of the 1989 King Faisal 
International Prize in science, which Zewail received in Saudi Arabia for 
"pioneering and excellent work on ultra-fast laser chemistry." Zewail received 
$100,000 along with the award. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview between celebrations at Caltech, the ebullient Zewail theorized 
that his airport introduction to America was symbolic of his later success. 
</P>
<P>
"It is because of this speed, this ability to move fast and cut through 
bureaucracy, that we can achieve quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues said Zewail adds enthusiasm and excitement to painstaking work on 
projects that require years to complete. But they add that he is extremely 
cautious and insists on absolute proof before allowing any of the results from 
projects he supervises to be published. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Outstanding Scientist' 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph Marcus, Caltech professor of chemistry, called Zewail "fearless, and an 
outstanding scientist." 
</P>
<P>
"He has a good eye for important problems and is willing to do everything that 
has to be done to get a solution," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
Zewail arrived at Caltech in 1976, after earning a bachelor's degree at 
Alexandria University in Egypt and graduate degrees at the University of 
Pennsylvania and UC Berkeley, where he did postdoctoral work. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, he was able to predict his Caltech research team's ability to "look at 
the moment of birth of a molecule." 
</P>
<P>
"A year later we saw it happen. It was a wonderful celebration," he said, 
waving toward empty Champagne bottles that still decorate a corner of his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his scientific achievement in family terms, Zewail said: "Molecules 
A and B meet, marry and beget the species. This takes place in one-millionth of 
a billionth of a second. This is a fundamental process in nature, and the world 
was looking for a way to be able to see the process. But many brilliant people 
said it couldn't be done." 
</P>
<P>
Using a laser as if it were a camera, and recording the phenomena through the 
use of a computer, Zewail said the laser could record in millionths of a 
billionth of a second, which is called a femtosecond. 
</P>
<P>
He described a femtosecond as equal to the time it takes light to travel one 
one-hundredth of the width of a human hair. Another analogy he uses is: "A 
femtosecond is comparable to one second in 32 million years. It is like 
watching a 32-million-year movie to see one second." 
</P>
<P>
The "marrying and birth" of molecules was recorded and proved repeatedly in his 
laboratory by a team working with him. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bernstein, a UCLA professor of chemistry and a member of the National 
Academy of Sciences, was a visiting scholar at Caltech working with Zewail's 
research team when proof of the molecular action was recorded in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said that, in applying laser physics to molecular bonding, Zewail was 
successful with "a concept that had been only a curiosity. He made it a useful 
tool." 
</P>
<P>
"Once we understand how molecules are formed, we can manipulate them," Zewail 
said. "If you can manipulate molecules you can manipulate genes and matter, you 
can synthesize new material -- the implications are just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Work Ahead 
</P>
<P>
Far from completing his project, Zewail said, the breakthrough "establishes 
what we have to work on for five to 10 years, as we try to understand why 
molecules love each other and hate each other. There is a lot of analogy 
between molecules and humans, but they are perhaps smarter." 
</P>
<P>
Doctoral student Marcos Dantus said Zewail "gets very excited, and that 
definitely has an impact on science. He will come to the lab or will keep 
calling, even if it's midnight, so you feel tremendous enthusiasm. And if we're 
down he'll give us a pep talk, like this is the most important thing in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
That excitement, Dantus said, stems from Zewail's "unusually strong intuition 
-- his feeling that comes from having done all the necessary research. It's an 
unusual characteristic for a scientist." 
</P>
<P>
Zewail traces his love for science to his family's encouragement and to the 
Egyptian educational system, which gives a lot of support to scholars. 
</P>
<P>
"The dream of my family was for me to be an educated person," he said, 
describing a well-rounded childhood in Alexandria with three sisters, all of 
whom have college educations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hero in Egypt 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm sort of a hero, and when I go there it's in all the newspapers," he 
said. "(Egyptians) see me as one of their people who can go to the United 
States and do something important, and they are very, very proud." 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived to study at the University of Pennsylvania in 1969, he said, "I 
immediately saw the difference between Egypt and us. I was so impressed by the 
way things go so fast, without so much bureaucracy. There is this element of 
the importance of time." 
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech when he received the King Faisal prize, Zewail 
credited his success to his family, to Egypt for his excellent early education, 
to Caltech for creating a good scientific atmosphere, and to colleagues and the 
78 graduate and postdoctoral students who have worked with him during his 13 
years at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
"But I tell you, it is really more luck," he said in the interview. "There is a 
lot to being in the right place at the right time with the right people. So I 
was in the right place and did the work that people were excited about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slap at Media 
</P>
<P>
A fan of almost everything American, he is nevertheless critical of the lack of 
media attention given to science. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in one of the most advanced nations on Earth in science and 
technology, and we don't have one hour a week devoted to science on national 
network television," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major problems we have is that young people are not super-excited 
about going into science," he said. "Instead, what we see is that, if you are 
smart, you can go to the stock market and very quickly become a millionaire and 
retire. The impact of this on the nation is very obvious."

TASK FORCE LISTS CHOICES FOR LANDFILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking its cue from the landfill shortage that has developed in North County, a 
joint San Diego city and county task force has identified six potential dump 
sites in the southern and western areas of the county to replace three that are 
rapidly filling. 
</P>
<P>
The task force study of the proposed sites will be presented to the public in 
community meetings over the next several weeks, and two or three of the six 
will eventually be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
But proposing sites may be the easiest step in the process, officials warned 
Tuesday. Overcoming opposition to the desperately needed landfills will be 
tougher, as evidenced by the political struggles that have stymied selection of 
a new North County trash dump site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
North Versus South 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that gaining final approval for a landfill site or sites in the 
southwest section of the county could take as long as seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to have to have it somewhere," County Supervisor Brian Bilbray 
said. "We know we're going to need it in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The search for space in the south is not as pressing as in the north, said 
Kathy Lehtola, program manager for the county Department of Public Works. 
Whereas dumps in Otay Mesa, Miramar and Sycamore are expected to be full in the 
late 1990s, the San Marcos landfill in North County is expected to be filled by 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
(The county will take a look at adding the so-called Lowry landfill site to 
three already under consideration in North County at a supervisors' meeting 
Tuesday.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're really early in the process," said Robert Epler, deputy director of 
waste management for the city of San Diego. "From a planning point of view, the 
timing of the South County search is better than the North County search. This 
represents a good starting point for discussion." 
</P>
<P>
One of the possible sites is in the city of San Diego, while the others are in 
unincorporatedareas of the county. Criteria used to identify potential sites 
included capacity, accessibility, land use, protection of ground water and 
natural resources and visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Lehtola said it will take up to three new sites to accommodate the trash 
disposal needs of the region stretching from Batiquitos Lagoon along the coast 
to Julian in East County, Campo along the U.S.-Mexico border and back to the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Although existing waste-reduction and recycling programs might cut the amount 
of trash entering the landfills, the sites eventually selected will be able to 
handle a "worst-case scenario" of the region's trash needs for 30 years. 
Combined, the sites would hold about 210 million cubic yards of solid waste, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Approval will be required from a plethora of political bodies, including the 
Board of Supervisors, the San Diego City Council, the state Regional Water 
Quality Control Board, the county Air Pollution Control District and the 
California Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
The sites are: 
</P>
<P>
* Oak Canyon, 300 acres, in the city of San Diego, west of the Sycamore 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
* Long Valley Peak, 700 acres, south of Interstate 8 across from Laguna 
Junction. 
</P>
<P>
* Campo Reservation, 350 acres, at the south end of the Indian reservation, 
near Tierra del Sol. 
</P>
<P>
* An unnamed site, 400 acres, south of California 94, west of Dulzura. 
</P>
<P>
* Marron Valley, 525 acres, south of Engineer Springs, along the international 
border. 
</P>
<P>
* East Otay Mesa, 425 acres, at the far eastern edge of Otay Mesa, near the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Landfill Sites 
</P>
<P>
1. Oak Canyon, in the city of San Diego, West of Sycamore Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
2. East Otay Mesa, far eastern edge of Otay Mesa, near the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
3. Unnamed, South of California 94, West of Dulzura. 
</P>
<P>
4. Marron Valley, South of Engineer Springs, along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
5. Long Valley Peak, South of 1-8 across from Laguna Junction. 
</P>
<P>
6. Campo Reservation, at the south end of the reservation, near Tierra Del Sol.

EXXON SEEKS TO ASSUAGE ENVIRONMENTAL FEARS OVER DAMAGED TANKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exxon executives met with San Diego environmentalists Tuesday to offer 
assurances that the Exxon Valdez -- the oil tanker that caused a mammoth oil 
spill off the Alaskan coast in March -- will pose no environmental hazard to 
San Diego Bay when the vessel is towed here for repairs next month. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Powell of the Environmental Health Coalition and Joan Jackson of the Sierra 
Club met with Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank J. Iarossi at the National 
Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. yard. According to both environmentalists, Iarossi 
requested the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Nassco built the Valdez in 1986 and has been contracted to do the repairs, 
which will cost about $25 million and take nine months to complete. Exxon has 
applied for a Coast Guard permit to tow the vessel 2,500 miles from Prince 
William Sound in Alaska to San Diego. Iarossi said the company expects to get 
the permit later this month, and it will take about three weeks to make the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cleansed of Oil 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Monday, Iarossi said the giant tanker has been cleansed 
of oil residue inside and out. According to Iarossi, the tanks in which the 
crude oil was stored have been thoroughly cleaned, and traces of oil amount to 
about one part per million. 
</P>
<P>
However, environmentalists said they are still concerned about the possibility 
that the Valdez could pollute harbor waters. Despite assurances from Iarossi 
that the ship is not a pollution threat, both Powell and Jackson said they will 
wait until they review an Exxon-sponsored study of the towing operation before 
making further comments. 
</P>
<P>
They said that Iarossi promised to make available to them a 70-page report that 
was also made available to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has proclaimed the 
vessel seaworthy. 
</P>
<P>
Powell criticized the San Diego Unified Port District's apparent lack of 
involvement in planning the towing project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Port District Notified 
</P>
<P>
"Both representatives (from Exxon and Nassco) came into the port and notified 
us," Port District spokesman Jim Anderson said. "We asked for some kind of 
assurance that it would pose no environmental problems. The two parties said 
they would be getting Coast Guard clearance that the ship would pose no 
pollution problems." 
</P>
<P>
Powell argued that the Port District should have played a more active role in 
the negotiations to bring the Valdez to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"They're relying on the Coast Guard to make the call on this and not being 
pro-active," Powell said. "They shouldn't do business this way. . . . The port 
should be demanding a more thorough review of this thing. They should send 
their own guys to look at the ship and decide if it's a threat." 
</P>
<P>
Powell added that his group also has reservations about the sudden announcement 
by Exxon executives that the Valdez will be repaired at Nassco and the fact 
that they did not solicit public comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still very uncomfortable about the way Exxon handled it," Powell said. 
"They basically popped this on everybody. . . . They said this is the way they 
wanted to do it; do it all at once and let everybody know at the same time. . . 
. Basically, nobody had any say in the matter except Exxon and Nassco." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Port District spokesman Anderson said Port officials were notified 
that the Valdez was being towed to San Diego shortly before the company made 
the decision public at a Monday-afternoon press conference at Nassco.

Two former San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. board members can testify about 
legal advice that the board relied on when it approved a proposed $2.4-billion 
merger with Southern California Edison, according to a state Public Utilities 
Commission decision issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling runs counter to SDG&amp;E's claim that Charles (Red) Scott and O. 
Morris Sievert, who resigned to protest the November vote, are prohibited from 
discussing legal advice that has traditionally been treated as confidential 
information. The utility unsuccessfully argued that the legal advice is covered 
by the attorney-client privilege. 
</P>
<P>
PUC Administrative Law Judge Edward W. O'Neill ruled Tuesday that SDG&amp;E's 
attorney-client privilege evaporated shortly after the board vote, when an 
SDG&amp;E executive gave a detailed analysis of the merger in a speech in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Might Appeal Ruling 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked and disappointed with the ruling," Jeff Guttero, SDG&amp;E 
assistant general counsel, said Tuesday. "And I'm not exactly clear on what 
(O'Neill) meant when he said that we'd waived the attorney-client 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Guttero told O'Neill on Tuesday that the utility might lodge an appeal with the 
full PUC once a written decision is issued. It was unclear when O'Neill would 
release a written decision. 
</P>
<P>
If O'Neill's ruling stands, it will clear the way for the city of San Diego to 
resume depositions with Scott and Sievert, both of whom have expressed doubts 
about the quality of legal advice that SDG&amp;E's board received before the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
During depositions earlier this year in San Diego, Scott and Sievert stopped 
short of revealing the confidential legal advice. The two San Diego businessmen 
instead agreed to honor SDG&amp;E's confidentiality request until the issue was 
resolved by a PUC law judge. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened today is an important decision," Robert Wright, Sievert's San 
Diego-based attorney, said Tuesday. "Of course, it remains to be seen if 
SDG&amp;E appeals to a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Haunt SDG&amp;E 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San 
Diego-based consumer group, said the ruling clears the way for Scott and 
Sievert to resume testifying about information board members had when they 
endorsed the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge determined that whatever attorney-client privilege did exist 
disappeared when (utility executive Stephen Baum) made that speech," Shames 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shames also suggested that the law judge's decision might haunt SDG&amp;E when 
utility executives take the stand during the PUC's upcoming review of the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it broadens the (questions that) intervenors can ask when they 
cross-examine (SDG&amp;E Chairman) Tom Page" and other SDG&amp;E executives, 
Shames said.

PAINTING WHALES IS A BIG THING TO THIS MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He calls himself Wyland ("I prefer no first name," he says), and he's no 
stranger to controversy. 
</P>
<P>
He says he's "on a mission" to paint, in various imposing sizes in cities 
throughout the world, murals of whales swimming in what he calls gravely 
endangered waters. 
</P>
<P>
Wyland, who has his home and studio in Laguna Beach, said Tuesday that he "just 
loves" San Diego, this being one of the few cities that, so far, hasn't 
complained about his work or ridden him out of town on a rail. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wyland is the artist who's painting a 140-by-40-foot mural of killer 
whales on the wall of The Plunge in Mission Beach. The Plunge is a former city 
pool, a longtime landmark in San Diego, that has been restored as part of a new 
commercial complex near the Belmont roller coaster. The now-private pool is 
open to the public for $2 a swim. 
</P>
<P>
Today The Plunge is the centerpiece of Fitness Advantage health club, the 
owners of which asked Wyland to come and display his talents on the wall of 
their building. 
</P>
<P>
He describes his work, titled "Orcas Off Point Loma," as the 16th such mural in 
a series of 100 he hopes to paint around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Wyland, who says he is painting the mural free (the $15,000 in materials is 
being provided by the building's owners) calls the work a gift to the city of 
San Diego and a salute to the 25th anniversary of Sea World. 
</P>
<P>
Whale enthusiasts might question Wyland's praise of Sea World, which some 
consider an enemy of killer whales, but Wyland said the aquatic park has done 
much to further research on whales and has opened up the world of marine life 
in general to children. 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as an environmentalist and naturalist, Wyland has miffed 
developers and politicians in several cities, including his own Laguna Beach 
and Honolulu, by painting murals so lavishly and on such a grand scale that 
critics call them traffic hazards and eyesores. 
</P>
<P>
He considers it part of the "phobic opposition" to public art that seems to 
rear its head in every U. S. city, but strangely, he said, hardly ever in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The mural at The Plunge, which is still being painted, will be dedicated June 
29. Wyland, 33, said it "depicts a pod, or family, of orcas -- killer whales -- 
off the coast of Point Loma. I paint them life-size, so the males are 30 feet 
long, the females 24 feet long. I'll have eight orcas in all in the local 
mural. I also show a cutaway of the San Diego and Point Loma coastlines. 
</P>
<P>
"My purpose is to raise public awareness about whales. . . . I consider myself 
as someone who's saving whales through art." 
</P>
<P>
Wyland did his first mural in Laguna Beach in 1981, and that's where the 
controversy started. He said he fought the city for two years to get the proper 
permits to continue his own brand of whale saving. But the outrage there was 
minor compared to Honolulu, where he's convinced that the size of the project 
-- 300 feet long, 20 stories high -- was too overwhelming for the locals to 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
"When you paint on that scale in public, you tend to be controversial whether 
you want to be or not," he said. "All I do is try to take ugly walls and turn 
them into art. Ninety percent of the people like me, but I can't please 
everybody, nor should I try."

'COMING HOME TO SMUG AMERICA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was living in Paris during the 1988 French presidential campaign and was 
fortunate to observe the vast differences between the American and French 
presidential election processes. Unlike Americans, the French are represented 
by various political parties which reflect a multitude of diverse beliefs and 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the French actively pursue political participation, they are aware 
and proud of their right to vote. Moreover, they exercise that vote. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Meisler notes in his telling article ("Coming Home to Find a Smug, 
Scared America," Opinion, June 4) that the French are frightened of the 
mindless "Americanization of their elections," but need not worry as they are 
far behind the U.S. Perhaps, Meisler overdoes it with regard to his praise of 
the French by stating that the French presidential debates were "sharp and 
meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
I, too, watched those televised debates. I remember awaiting impatiently to 
finally see a debate of substance unlike the exchange of programmed one-liners 
I had been accustomed to in the States. Unfortunately, I failed to see any 
difference between the dialectic capabilities of Francois Mitterand and Jacques 
Chirac, and those of George Bush and Michael Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
A politician is a politician; campaign rhetoric and evasion of immediate 
concerns are constant, regardless of one's nationality. The advent of 
programmed one-liners is not only an American revelation.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having also lived abroad and experienced many different countries, I had to 
chuckle to myself as I read Meisler's criticism of present America because it's 
all so true but no one here seems to know it. 
</P>
<P>
In my experience, Europeans consider us either silly for our prudish mores 
(remember the international giggle over Gary Hart, not over the girl, but that 
it brought him down?), and for our wacky consumerism, and plastic art and 
literature. Or we're looked on sadly for our violent crime and insatiable money 
thirst. Or we're feared as a danger for the fact that our huge war arsenal is 
in the control of thick-headed chauvinists, and for our disrespect for the 
environment and untainted food. 
</P>
<P>
Meisler failed to note one difference between the U.S. and other countries 
which I found to be the most profound -- our lack of personal freedom. Like 
most Americans, I carried the American freedom myth to Europe and ran smack 
into my biggest culture shock. While societal laws and rules are there, of 
course, the pervading sense of total personal restriction is not. The soul and 
will felt free. I became so pleasingly used to this that I forgot how men cower 
here until I visited East Berlin and commented to my girlfriend that "this 
place is just like the States." A fellow who works in my office just returned 
from his first trip to France and observed that, for example, you can "state 
your case to a cop there," while we all know what would happen if we talked 
back to one of our "holier-than-thou" cops. 
</P>
<P>
I plan to make my home in Europe and only hope that the Americanization we keep 
hearing about hasn't advanced too far.

A NEW ANTITOXIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is something average Californians can do about toxic pollutants. They 
should encourage legislators in Sacramento to pass a bill that would help 
companies use fewer hazardous substances in manufacturing. The measure, AB 
1430, sponsored by Assembly members Delaine Eastin (D-Union City) and John 
Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), would establish a toxics-use reduction institute 
that would conduct research, circulate its findings among companies that use 
toxics and train people in methods to reduce toxics use. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its fundamental mission of research, the institute would help 
companies learn about other firms' success stories, just as the agricultural 
extension service helps farmers learn new methods. One way the institute will 
be exploring involves encouraging companies to switch materials they use in the 
manufacturing process. For example, a Tennessee company that makes gift-wrap 
paper converted from ink made from organic solvents to water-based inks, 
meaning it could use less toxic cleaning solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Other users of toxic substances have changed their method of operation. Hill 
Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, now strips paint from aircraft with sandblasting 
equipment instead of chemical solvents. And some companies have found that 
better housekeeping also can reduce toxic leaks or evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
The institute may be based at San Jose State University because of intense 
concern about toxics in the Silicon Valley electronics manufacturing area. The 
initial cost is estimated at $1.5 million annually. It would be financed from 
the unitary tax fund, paid to the state by multinational companies as part of a 
compromise aimed at reducing revenue loss. Politically, that may be the only 
feasible way to start the institute, but ultimately it probably should be 
financed by a tax on manufacturers that produce the toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation setting up this vital institute has passed the Assembly Toxics 
Committee and comes up early next week in the Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee. The best way to reduce the3 million tons of toxic waste that 
California generates each year is to develop technology that creates less of 
that waste in the first place. This bill would help reach that goal.

THE CLEAN-AIR AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time this decade the White House has spoken encouraging words for 
clean air. 
</P>
<P>
Forests and lakes under clouds of acid rain were among the big winners in the 
environmental program that President Bush unwrapped Monday. The Reagan White 
House could never bring itself to agree with Canada and New England that such 
clouds even existed. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's new clean-air plan, the toughest yet enacted anywhere, 
was an obvious model for many of Bush's ideas. The South Coast Air Quality 
Management District, which devised the plan, will find the tacit support 
helpful against critics who complain that the district plan asks too much of 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
The President also would spend $2 billion a year to control toxic chemicals 
from hundreds of factories, automobiles and plants that use solvents for 
processing. The federal government, after 15 years with such regulatory 
authority, now enforces it at only seven plants. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, under the President's schedule, the air over all but three cities -- 
New York, Houston and Los Angeles -- would be clean enough to breathe 10 years 
from now with no risk to health. In another 20 years, Southern California, 
which now has the dirtiest air in the nation, would meet the test. 
</P>
<P>
Some elements of the plan are controversial. Some of what the President intends 
is still murky. Some of the reaction was entirely predictable. Detroit said, 
"Not so fast." Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who works on the cutting 
edge of environmental law, said, "Not enough." But for the most part, the plan 
is cause for a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Where the plan fails is in not looking far enough into the future. Implicit in 
the President's proposals is an assumption that periodic improvements in the 
technology of trapping pollution is all that's required. That seemed true 20 
years ago, when Washington followed California's lead in starting to cope with 
smog. But researchers now know that byproducts of combustion, such as carbon 
dioxide, have wrapped an envelope of pollution around the Earth that traps warm 
air. There is no longer a question about whether the resulting greenhouse 
effect will create a warming trend with unforeseeable consequences. The only 
question is whether it has already started. The plan needs expanding. 
</P>
<P>
In his message, Bush proposed to cut in half the 20 million tons of sulfur 
dioxide that escape each year from coal-burning power plants and create acid 
rain. The plan uses a variation of a "pollution tax," something that economists 
have urged for years as a tool to cut pollution but that environmentalists have 
opposed as a license to pollute. 
</P>
<P>
Written in consultation with the Environmental Defense Fund -- scarcely an 
organization to help write a license to pollute -- the plan would require 107 
coal-burning power plants to cut sulfur dioxide emissions starting in 1990 to 
2.5 pounds of pollutant for every 1 million (British thermal) units of heat 
they produce. Rather than make an immediate investment in controls, a utility 
company producing 3.0 pounds of pollutant could buy credits for its excess from 
another plant whose newer equipment was holding down emissions to 2.0 pounds, 
for an average of 2.5 pounds. After five years, all power plants would be 
limited to 1.2 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million BTUs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan to scatter one million cars that burn fuel cleaner than gasoline 
among nine metropolitan areas will help Southern California by accelerating 
development of both cars and clean-fuel stations. The air quality district 
already plans to use such cars to hold down pollution until something better 
comes along, perhaps fuel cells that generate electricity chemically rather 
than by combustion. Tighter pollution controls on standard car engines will 
help clean up the air in other states, but in some cases will fall short of 
what California already requires. 
</P>
<P>
Congress will require no special invitation to examine the President's package 
with care. All but the most skeptical will welcome it as an important first 
step. 
</P>
<P>
Then, to meet the most important challenge of the next, rather than the last, 
20 years, Congress and the President must add a massive search for ways to 
produce energy without burning oil, coal or even so-called clean fossil fuels. 
Environmental pollution is no longer local or even national but global. 
Pollution cannot be stopped until the industrial nations find not just 
alternative fuels but alternatives to fuel, and share them, in their own best 
interests, with the rest of the globe. As it has in the past, the United States 
can show the way.

EAST-WEST HYBRID IS ECONOMICS' MUTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By P. EDWARD HALEY, P. Edward Haley is a professor of political science and 
senior research associate at the Keck Center for International Strategic 
Studies, Claremont McKenna College. He is writing a book on the foreign policy 
of the Bush Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For months the reform movements in the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe 
have taken the world on an emotional roller-coaster ride. Again and again our 
hopes have risen to the sky and then plummeted to earth. We have seen the first 
bloom of glasnost in Moscow and the use of poison gas against protest marchers 
in Soviet Georgia. We marveled at the astounding spectacle of a million 
peaceful demonstrators in Tian An Men Square and recoiled in horror at the 
cruel suppression of the protest by assault troops. Before the firing had 
stopped in Beijing, we were celebrating the victory of Solidarity in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Roller-coaster rides are exhilarating, but they are not the best occasion in 
which to evaluate the nature and direction of anything. Now that Beijing has 
been terrorized into silence, we might ask some careful questions about reforms 
in the communist world and their meaning. 
</P>
<P>
As matters of economics, we know the reforms cannot succeed. There is some 
sense to a command economy on the old Stalinist model, more sense to a market 
economy in the Western style, but no sense at all to the hybrid 
Stalinist/market economies that China and the Soviet Union have begun to 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Stalinist practice taught the world that people will work (not very well) out 
of fear; the West and the newly industrialized countries have taught us that 
people will work (very well) for the right incentives. But mixed 
Stalinist/market economies created by political bargaining are neither fearsome 
nor alluring. In a way, these hybrids bear the defects of both East and West. 
Everyone waits for directions from the center, which do not come, while 
everyone lacks the incentive to take the initiative. Whatever else they 
achieve, the Stalinist hybrid economies will not -- cannot -- deliver 
modernization, high technology and low-priced consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, reformers and traditionalists alike in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe will soon grow tired of all the posturing without power. It is 
humiliating, a kind of bogus political circus in which the reformers must jump 
through meaningless hoops. The outcome of the recent elections to the Supreme 
Soviet showed how the system has been rigged to ensure that the Communist Party 
of the Soviet Union remains firmly in control. At least the Chinese 
authoritarians declined to force this embarrassing ballet on their students and 
reformers. 
</P>
<P>
For the loyalists in the Soviet Union, the new institutions and procedures are 
annoying and dangerous. Their annoyance is obvious. They are constantly 
criticized. Their accomplishments are belittled. They are exposed to ridicule 
and hatred. Politicians everywhere despise being on the defensive like this and 
will do everything they can to stop it. The reforms are dangerous to the regime 
because they foster the impression that power is up for grabs in the Soviet 
Union. If this impression is allowed to continue, sooner or later reformers 
will try to take power, perhaps through massive demonstrations of the kind seen 
in Beijing and Soviet Georgia. The loyalists and the Gorbachevite reformers 
will fight as Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng have in China to prevent a transfer of 
power out of the hands of the Soviet -- or Polish or Czech or East German -- 
Communist parties. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms' most interesting development is the final and total collapse of 
Marxism. This truly historic phenomenon carries a number of crucially important 
implications for all nations. I'll briefly sketch three: 
</P>
<P>
In the industrial democracies and developing countries, the greatest risk is 
hubris, overweening arrogance, a defiance of faith and reason that is 
self-destructive. Now that no serious student of political economy can endorse 
the Marxist path to development, a major counterforce to market economics has 
disappeared. Into that void in the industrial democracies are flooding 
puffed-up apologists of unrestrained capitalism. The resulting conflict already 
shows in the polarized and paralyzed national economic debate in the United 
States. Congress will not cut expenditures, the President will not seek higher 
taxes. Meanwhile, the wealth of the country is being transferred to others. 
These extremes of polarization are already stalking the developed and 
developing world. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union the greatest accomplishment of Marxism was to glue a 
multinational country together. While official belief in Marxism prevailed, 
nationalism was overwhelmed. In practice, Soviet authority may have been 
Russian, but in principle nationality didn't matter. One day -- on that brave 
Marxist day of the arrival of true communism -- nationalism was to disappear. 
That pretense is gone. What is left except the increasingly dangerous clash of 
conflicting and aggrieved nationalisms? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, although it may gall some Western ideologues to admit, most analysts 
would agree that Mao and Marx once held the Mandate of Heaven in China. In 
Western terms, a social contract existed. Now the contract is broken. And it is 
broken at a time when excesses of Mao and Marx have destroyed the old culture 
of China. A new political culture must be born without the old limits and 
restraints, under the heavy and sometimes shaky hand of an increasingly 
illegitimate tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most attractive metaphor is not a roller-coaster ride but an 
Indonesian shadow play. There is music and laughter. There are images on the 
screen. They frighten, amuse, educate. But they are only shadows of the 
originals. Behind the screen the sources of change and movement are hidden. It 
is time to look behind the screen.

THE SLOW BURN OF GENTRIFICATION IN FAIRFAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FEUER and STEPHEN J. SASS, Michael Feuer and Stephen Sass are 
attorneys and members of the Committee to Preserve Fairfax. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the venerable Pan Pacific Auditorium in the Fairfax neighborhood went up 
in flames, it took nearly six decades of Los Angeles history with it. Yet the 
loss of this landmark could pale by comparison to an even more devastating 
tragedy looming less conspicuously: the gradual sacrifice of the vibrant 
Fairfax neighborhood to gentrification precipitated by large-scale commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles needs to treat exceptional, increasingly fragile communities like 
the Fairfax district that housed the Pan Pacific with special care because we 
have precious few of them. For nearly 60 years, the Fairfax neighborhood has 
attracted a population of largely elderly people of modest means, most of whom 
are Jewish and many of whom are immigrants. Over the years they have been 
joined by young families eager to share a way of life exemplified by the tiny 
mom-and-pop stores, small houses of worship, bakeries and delicatessens that 
line Fairfax and nearby streets, all built on a scale that welcomes 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
This vision of Fairfax, however, is becoming anachronistic and could become 
downright obsolete unless creative action is taken soon. Farmers Market, in the 
center of the neighborhood, is the proposed site of a 2-million-square-foot 
upscale development, including a hotel, theaters and boutiques. If this 
collection of enterprises seems incongruous with the description we have just 
painted of the neighborhood, it is because the developers fully expect the 
neighborhood to change when the project is completed. Commercial developments 
of similar scale are contemplated for other neighborhood sites, including the 
Park La Brea apartment complex. Indeed, until the fire, the Pan Pacific was to 
have been developed into a commercial complex. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of this dramatic infusion of nouveau commerce into the 
neighborhood could be disastrous. Even with the passage of Proposition U and 
efforts by City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and others to "downzone" certain 
blocks, recently one city planner noted that the displacement of low-income 
seniors in the Fairfax area continues. Small, multiple-unit apartments are 
being gutted and upgraded, and younger, more affluent tenants are replacing the 
traditional residents. 
</P>
<P>
This trend is certain to accelerate once developments like the one proposed for 
Farmers Market take root. And the dilemma is exacerbated by the existence of a 
provision of the Los Angeles rent-control ordinance, under which an apartment 
usually may be rented at whatever rate a landlord chooses when it becomes 
vacant. Of course, new developments are exempt from rent control altogether. 
Senior citizens on fixed incomes and young working-class families will soon no 
longer be able to rent apartments that an earlier generation found affordable. 
</P>
<P>
This change in demography also portends another casualty: Without its 
traditional patrons, the long-extant ethnic commerce of the neighborhood could 
not be sustained. If this vision were to become reality, an irreplaceable part 
of our culture and traditions -- not that of the Jewish community alone, but in 
an important way, of all of us -- would be lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
They say you can't stop "progress," but we can do a much better job of defining 
our terms. First, the City Council should pass an ordinance that requires city 
planners to analyze the cultural, social and historical implications of 
proposed developments before they are approved. And developers should be 
required to take these implications into account in designing their projects. 
Municipal planning should be undertaken in a more comprehensive fashion, rather 
than the all-too-frequent piecemeal basis that has characterized the evaluation 
of proposed developments. Historic preservation laws should be strengthened to 
more permanently protect designated monuments and neighborhoods. Those who own 
property should be permitted to develop it, but not without, for example, 
creating affordable housing where the development is likely to diminish it. In 
all, city government must assume leadership in helping developer and homeowner, 
apartment dweller and landlord to transcend divisive bickering and achieve a 
result that benefits the community. 
</P>
<P>
If a consequence of the Pan Pacific fire is the awakening of a neighborhood to 
the necessity of creative action to preserve its existence, then perhaps the 
destruction of a landmark might lead to the affirmation of a community.

CSUN OFFICIALS SAY HE'S SAFE; 
</P>
<P>
MISSING STUDENT LOCATED IN CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The only remaining Cal State Northridge student still missing in China since 
the killings began there earlier this month has sent word to his family that he 
is safe, CSUN officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The student, Jeff G. Winters, 29, and two female companions sent word to their 
families by telegram Monday that they were traveling through Yunnan province in 
the southwest corner of China, near the cities of Dali and Lijang, school 
officials said. The telegram was sent to the father of one of the women. The 
message was relayed to Winter's mother in Salt Lake City, Utah, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
School authorities had not heard from Winters -- one of 28 CSUN students who 
had spent the spring semester studying Chinese language, history and geography 
at Shaanxi University in the city of Xian -- since May 26. Officials had feared 
that the blond and blue-eyed Winters, although fluent in Chinese and an 
experienced Asian traveler, might have run into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Six other CSUN students are still in China, said Adele Juarez, overseas studies 
director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now Feels Safe 
</P>
<P>
Four of those students have decided to remain in Xian until the end of June, 
Juarez said. Another student who had been hiding with a friend's family in 
Beijing called his parents Monday to say that he now feels safe and will remain 
there until June 20. A sixth student, who fell ill while traveling through 
western China, has joined the group in Xian and is planning to leave the 
country this week, Juarez said. 
</P>
<P>
Two CSUN students who cut short their stay in China and left May 23 because of 
growing tensions in the city of Xian said in campus interviews Tuesday that 
CSUN officials were slow to respond to the trouble there. Xian is about 600 
miles south of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have taken the conservative route and told the students to come 
home earlier," said Artanzia Parker, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Bostow, 20, said that shortly before she and Parker left China, the 
CSUN administrator in charge of the students in Xian told her that there was 
little danger. But ten days later, Chinese troops fired on students in 
Beijing's Tian An Men Square, Bostow said. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Associate Vice President Mack Johnson said the school had sent a memo to 
the students in Xian during the week of May 22 that contained the latest advice 
from the State Department. At that time, State Department officials recommended 
that American citizens not travel to China but did not recommend that Americans 
leave the country, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a press conference Tuesday, CSUN geography department chairman 
I-Shou Wang, one of seven professors who returned to Los Angeles from China on 
Monday, said he believed that the group was never in danger in Xian. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt any threat," said Wang, who has traveled to China eight times in 
the last nine years. "I was very surprised to hear that my colleagues were 
terrified . . . the difference was their perception." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the returning professors had said they became fearful while in Xian 
after hearing rumors that the Chinese army was preparing to enter the city and 
forcibly quell the massive student demonstrations there.

FEAR ADDED GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS WORRIED OVER PLANS TO UPGRADE SEWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like most major sewer construction projects, a proposal to upgrade and expand 
city plumbing in North Hollywood has caused nearby residents to worry about 
torn-up streets and traffic disruption. 
</P>
<P>
But 10 miles to the northeast in Sunland-Tujunga, residents are even more 
concerned that the sewer system expansion would dash their chances of 
controlling growth. They fear that the additional sewer capacity could double 
the present population of about 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
The North Hollywood Interceptor Sewer, which would cost an estimated $7 million 
to build, was presented to the public Tuesday night at a meeting at Colfax 
School. The project requires an environmental impact report, which will entail 
several formal public hearings, and it would take at least a year to build the 
first phase, said City Engineer Robert S. Horii. 
</P>
<P>
A flyer sent to residents of the area listed three possible routes, all of 
which would run under residential streets near the junction of the Hollywood 
and Ventura freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Horii said the expansion is needed to relieve North Hollywood sewers, which 
have become overburdened during the past few years as the city worked to switch 
industries and residences from septic tanks, many of which were polluting 
ground water. He said it would also provide additional capacity as the 
northeast San Fernando Valley grows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ammunition for Developers? 
</P>
<P>
J. Sylvia Gross, who lives in the Blanchard Canyon area of Sunland-Tujunga, 
said Tuesday that she and her neighbors fear that the increased sewer capacity 
will provide ammunition for developers fighting slow-growth advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"We fight very hard here to keep development down as much as we can," said 
Gross, vice president and land-use chairman of the Sunland-Tujunga Assn. of 
Residents. "What we don't want here is growth; we want to preserve our 
mountains." 
</P>
<P>
However, Horii said the city is merely trying to get a step ahead of 
development by expanding sewer capacity to meet growth projections already 
included in community plans. He said that if additional homes are never built, 
the sewer lines do not have to be used to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't cost that much more to put the line in a little bit larger to 
handle that growth," Horii said. "But it would be expensive in the future if 
the growth does happen and we do not have the lines in. We would have to put in 
all new lines." 
</P>
<P>
Both Gross and Tom Patterson, a member of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn. 
in North Hollywood, complained that a flyer about the sewer expansion sent out 
by the Los Angeles Department of Public Works was vague. Gross said she did not 
realize until days after she received it that the project affected her area 
because the flyer only mentioned Sunland-Tujunga once. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows connections but doesn't show what it's connecting to," Patterson 
said. "There's no supporting data, no cost data. It should've been more 
comprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoid Disruption 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said some traffic disruption could be avoided if the project were 
combined with light-rail plans and followed rail corridors. He said 
consideration of the project should be halted until a decision on light-rail 
routes is reached. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said he was particularly concerned about one of the three 
alternatives, which calls for part of the line to head down Colfax Avenue 
between Burbank Boulevard and Valley Spring Lane. The city recently repaved 
that stretch of Colfax. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows a total lack of coordination among city agencies," he said. "It 
doesn't make sense to tear up the street they just got done repaving." 
</P>
<P>
Horii said that although city agencies do try to communicate, sometimes things 
are overlooked. But he said the city might consider dropping the Colfax Avenue 
option if it believes that tearing up the street again would be too much of a 
burden for the neighborhood.

WATER NEAR LAB FOUND SAFE; 
</P>
<P>
TESTS DOWNHILL FROM SITE BACK ROCKWELL CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tests of three private wells and a spring near Rockwell International's Santa 
Susana Field Laboratory show that the water is safe to drink, Ventura County 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The tests were of the closest drinking water supplies downhill from the 
laboratory site. The results confirmed Rockwell claims that radioactive 
contamination -- found in low levels at the site -- had not spread downhill and 
posed no danger to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gallagher, an official with the county's Environmental Health Department, 
said radioactivity levels in the wells and spring were below state drinking 
water standards, indicating that there has been no pollution of the water 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
"The water is safe to drink," Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Johnson, president of the Susana Knolls Homeowners Assn., said area 
residents welcomed the results because they have been worried about their 
health and property values. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Laboratory 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the tests, conducted for the county by a private laboratory, found 
radiation levels no higher than levels that occur naturally. The water was 
tested for both alpha and beta radiation, both potentially hazardous but acting 
on the body in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
Water from the wells and the spring showed alpha levels ranging from one to 11 
picocuries per liter, below the state drinking water standard of 15 picocuries, 
Gallagher said. A picocurie is a unit of radiologic measurement. 
</P>
<P>
Beta radiation ranged from seven to 10 picocuries per liter, below the state 
limit of 50 picocuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county offered two weeks ago to test private wells and springs for any 
concerned residents after reports of radioactive and chemical pollution at the 
lab raised fears about possible ground-water contamination in neighboring 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Contamination of a portion of the 2,668-acre complex was described in a 
preliminary report released last month by the U.S. Department of Energy, which 
contracted with Rockwell's Rocketdyne division for nuclear work. 
</P>
<P>
The report stated that while the pollution posed no immediate threat to nearby 
residents, more environmental tests were necessary to determine the extent of 
the contamination because of inadequacies in the company's ground-water 
monitoring system. 
</P>
<P>
The water came from wells and a spring belonging to three homeowners in Santa 
Susana Knolls, a community in the unincorporated area of Ventura County on the 
edge of Simi Valley, about two miles northeast of the lab. The wells are on 
land near Rocky and Rainey roads; the spring is near Black Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners, the only ones who responded to the county offer of free tests, 
took their own water samples in plastic jugs, but county officials said the 
sampling method did not present problems that would have biased the results. 
</P>
<P>
Don Boydston, a retired businessman who owns the well near Rocky Road, said he 
asked the county to test his water because he uses the well for drinking. "It's 
a big relief to know there's nothing in the water," Boydston said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeated Tests 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne spokesman Pat Coulter said the test results show that "there is 
absolutely nothing for homeowners to worry about." Company officials have said 
they repeatedly tested 16 wells and springs within a mile of the site over the 
last four years without detecting any chemical or radioactive pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Levels of radioactivity slightly above state standards were detected in three 
of the wells in 1986, but there is no indication that the low radioactivity 
poses a danger or that it came from the research lab, instead of occurring 
naturally in the rocks and soil. None of the 16 wells tested were used for 
drinking water, Rockwell officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm plans to drill an additional 18 wells by the end of the year in a 
portion of the site where nuclear research was conducted for nearly 40 years. 
The company now monitors 123 wells on the site, officials said.

'FAME' ACTOR GETS 28-MONTH SENTENCE FOR DRIVING DRUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A co-star in the former television series "Fame" was sentenced Tuesday to 28 
months in prison for felony drunk driving stemming from an accident in which a 
Studio City man and his two sons were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth C. Swofford, 55, who played a high school principal in the show that 
aired in syndication until 1987, pleaded no contest to drunk driving charges at 
a previous hearing in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
George Charous, 37, suffered a fractured spine and a broken leg in the Dec. 17 
crash at Ventura Boulevard and Eureka Avenue in Studio City. Paul Charous, 11, 
suffered skull fractures and his brother, Stephen, 6, had a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford was driving west on Ventura Boulevard when his car swerved into 
oncoming traffic and hit Charous' car head-on. 
</P>
<P>
Before imposing sentence, Judge Richard G. Kolostian noted that the actor had 
no history of arrests or convictions. "You're not a bad person," Kolostian said 
to Swofford. "Other than this accident, you could be man of the year." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Probation Denied 
</P>
<P>
Kolostian, however, said he was going to deny Swofford probation because unless 
"a first-time drunk driver is sentenced to jail time, we won't have any effect 
on drunk drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Swofford did not show any emotion when Kolostian pronounced sentence moments 
later. In addition to the 28 months he must serve, Swofford was ordered to pay 
$9,600 restitution to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford appeared on the verge of tears as he hugged family members outside the 
courtroom afterward. Both the actor and his attorney, Herb Steinberg, declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pargament said he was pleased with the judge's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good sentence," Pargament said, adding that Swofford could have 
received up to four years in prison. "It was well-thought out and 
well-balanced. The judge gave due consideration to the seriousness of the 
injuries -- not to one, but to three people -- and picked a middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
George Charous, who attended the proceeding, said he also was "very satisfied" 
with the outcome. Charous said his sons have recovered from their injuries, but 
that he still attends physical therapy sessions twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
He said a civil suit that he filed against Swofford in Van Nuys Superior Court 
is pending, but declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford, who is free on $2,500 bail, was ordered to begin serving his sentence 
June 27.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. BOARD TO CONDUCT HEARING ON PORTER RANCH 
DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Referred Powers will consider a proposal to develop a 
$2-million residential and commercial development in Porter Ranch on June 21 in 
the City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The board will conduct a public hearing on the development immediately after 
the City Council meeting, which begins at 10 a.m. and typically last until noon 
or 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Los Angeles city attorney's office disqualified the Planning 
Commission from voting on the proposal because Commissioner Theodore Stein Jr., 
who owns property near the project, has a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The five council-member Board of Referred Powers is headed by Councilman Hal 
Bernson, whose North Valley district includes the hilly Porter Ranch area. The 
panel convenes to decide issues that city commissioners or board members have 
conflicts with. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members on the panel include Joan Milke Flores, who serves as 
vice chairwoman; Marvin Braude, Richard Alatorre and Zev Yaroslavsky.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE REFUSES TO DROP PROSTITUTION CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in four weeks, a judge refused Tuesday to drop prostitution 
charges against a Canyon Country couple who say they have reestablished an 
ancient religion that includes sex acts in its rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Marion O. Obera rejected a motion by Will and 
Mary Ellen Tracy, who said a Los Angeles police investigation into their Church 
of the Most High Goddess violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of 
separation of church and state. Last month, another judge refused to drop the 
misdemeanor charges after the Tracys argued that the First Amendment protected 
their religious activities. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy, 46, and Will Tracy, 51, have been charged with operating a 
house of prostitution. Mary Ellen Tracy also faces two counts of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the church, which operated out of a house in West Los Angeles, is a 
front for prostitution because the Tracys require men to make donations before 
participating in sexual rites. The Tracys say the donations are "sacrifices" 
and deny that they constitute an exchange of sex for money.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEY SAYS DRIVER TRIED TO AVOID CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The driver of a car that sped through a red light and collided with another 
vehicle, killing three people, was trying to avoid causing an accident at the 
time of the collision, his attorney argued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Epstein said in his closing statements to a Van Nuys Superior Court jury 
that Gregory Masterson Michael ran the light after changing lanes to avoid 
hitting a car stopped at the intersection where the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, 22, is on trial on three counts of felony vehicular manslaughter with 
gross negligence in connection with the Oct. 22 accident. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Rochel, 84, of Beverly Hills; his wife, Ashraf, 71, and their 
grandson, Jonathan Rochel, died in the accident at Victory Boulevard and White 
Oak Avenue in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein admitted that his client caused the accident, but said Michael could 
only be found guilty of misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter because the 
prosecution had failed to prove gross negligence as required for felony 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip Rabichow disputed Epstein's argument, saying that 
Michael had been driving in excess of 60 m.p.h. for several blocks before the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of a misdemeanor, Michael could receive three years in County 
Jail, authorities said. If found guilty of a felony, he faces a maximum 
sentence of 18 years in prison.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: N. HOLLYWOOD MAN GUILTY OF FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando Superior Court jury convicted a North Hollywood man of 
first-degree murder Tuesday in the shooting death of another man outside a bar. 
</P>
<P>
After deliberating just two hours, the jury found Daniel Vasquez, 28, guilty of 
murdering Mario Rivas, 31, also of North Hollywood, on May 14, 1988, outside a 
bar at the intersection of Burbank Boulevard and Cleon Boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
A second jury is deliberating the case of Jose Vasquez, who also is charged 
with first-degree murder in Rivas' death. Jose Vasquez is no relation to Daniel 
Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Janice L. Maurizi said that Daniel Vasquez apparently 
mistook Rivas for another man with whom he had quarreled inside the bar before 
it closed. Rivas was shot in the back as he attempted to flee the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Vasquez faces 27 years to life imprisonment and will be sentenced July 
6. After sentencing, he will be sent to Oregon and Washington, where he is 
wanted in other murders, Maurizi said.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS BIRD-WATCHER PREFERS CARDINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Bird, back home in Indiana, didn't catch much of Michael Jordan's act in 
the playoffs, but he figures he didn't miss much. 
</P>
<P>
Of Jordan's performances against New York, Cleveland and Detroit, Bird said: 
"He wasn't doing anything to them he hasn't already done to me." (Jordan once 
torched the Celtics with 63 points in the playoffs.) 
</P>
<P>
Bird told Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe that he watches little basketball, but a 
lot of baseball, especially when the St. Louis Cardinals are playing. 
</P>
<P>
He watches them on the satellite dish and listens to them on radio. He has AM 
1340 punched up on the radio in his truck so he can catch the broadcasts. 
That's not the extent of his support. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I drink Bud Light is so I can help pay Ozzie Smith's salary," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Add Bird: Looking to next season, he said: "We've got a chance to have a great 
team. I mean that. Look at our assets. There is no one in the middle that can 
shoot or defend better than Robert Parish, and there's still nobody who can 
stop Kevin McHale one on one." 
</P>
<P>
A real big fella: Mychal Thompson, on the retirement of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: 
"I'll be back, but they have to get another big man to start. It's my style to 
come off the bench. They ought to sign Tony Mandarich. Nobody can block out 
like that, and I'm sure he'd rather play for the Lakers than the Green Bay 
Packers." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Ray Corio of the New York Times asks this one: "What player holds 
the record for most home runs hit lifetime in one stadium?" 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: You've heard of players who were older than their 
managers, but Texas pitchers Nolan Ryan and Charlie Hough are older than their 
manager and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan is 42. Hough is 41, as is General Manager Tom Grieve, but Hough will be 42 
next January, ahead of Grieve next March. Manager Bobby Valentine is 39. 
</P>
<P>
It-had-to-happen Dept.: Praising the mechanics of Dodger pitcher Mike Morgan 
Monday night, Z Channel analyst Don Sutton said as Morgan started to deliver, 
"Watch his follow-through." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan delivered a high, high, high hard one that hit the screen. Manute Bol 
couldn't have touched it. 
</P>
<P>
No energy crisis: Dennis Rodman, the Detroit Piston showboat, told the New York 
Times: "I'm always called hotdog, but I'm not. I'm just hyper. I'm hyper in 
everything. I eat fast, I drive fast, I just always have to be doing something 
fast. When I was a boy, my mother took me to a doctor. She thought maybe there 
was something wrong with me. 
</P>
<P>
" 'No,' the doctor told her, 'he's just got a lot of energy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mel Ott of the New York Giants, with 324 home runs in the Polo 
Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Coach Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia Eagles, stressing leadership to 
his players, has this sign on his desk: "If you ain't the lead dog, the scenery 
never changes."

LOCAL ANGLERS' ALBATROSS OF NO ALBACORE COULD BE ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Will the albacore, the popular tuna that have been frustratingly elusive for 
Southland fishermen in recent years, show along Southern California this 
summer? 
</P>
<P>
Experts will say only that conditions appear better than last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the conditions look good," said Ron Dotson, a National Marine 
Fisheries biologist and albacore specialist in La Jolla. "The cold, off-color 
water extending from Point Conception to Ensenada should not block the fish 
from entering Southern California waters." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Dotson said, the band of off-color water extended about 50 miles 
south of Ensenada and, for the most part, prevented the fish from making their 
way into local waters from the west. Albacore migrate from the mid-Pacific, 
west of Hawaii, to the waters of Baja, Southern and Central California. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, fishermen off the Central California coast caught only a smattering 
of albacore, but those off the Oregon and Washington coasts experienced some of 
the best albacore fishing in years. In fact, northern fishing was so good that 
much of California's commercial fleet spent the summer near Westport, Wash. By 
and large, the albacore have bypassed Southern California for the last three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A fairly large school of albacore was reportedly found this week by the skipper 
of a tanker at the Erben Bank, about 700 miles west of San Diego. According to 
Dotson, a commercial boat is at that location but has yet to report its 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the reports made by the tanker's skipper, the American Angler of Point 
Loma Sportfishing will make an exploratory three-day run for albacore June 22. 
</P>
<P>
"We're presuming that they'll be in a little closer by then," said the 
landing's Judy Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, there has been no albacore effort made so far by the San Diego 
sportfishing fleet, which relies heavily on the albacore -- and the following 
they generate -- to pay its bills. The American Angler is going, according to 
Collins, "because nobody else wants to take the chance." 
</P>
<P>
According to Dotson there has been no commercial effort in the mid-Pacific 
either, primarily because the albacore fleet has been busy working the 
productive South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no effort and no (concrete) information to go on," he said. "All we 
can do is look at the conditions." 
</P>
<P>
For the record: It was reported here two weeks ago that there had never been a 
1,000-pound marlin caught by a recreational fisherman off Baja Peninsula, but a 
blue marlin weighing 1,056 pounds was caught off Cabo San Lucas by John Conant 
of North Hollywood in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
AeroCalifornia, a Mexican air carrier based in La Paz, is scheduled to make its 
United States debut Thursday when its fleet of DC-9s begins flying from LAX to 
Loreto, La Paz and Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts Airlines, which had been the only carrier from Los Angeles to Loreto, 
went out of business last month. 
</P>
<P>
Tag applications for deer, bear, bighorn sheep, elk and antelope are available 
at sporting goods stores and DFG offices, which are reminding hunters that the 
applications must be filed before the annual tag drawing July 8. 
</P>
<P>
A DFG spokesman said that X zone, special deer and special bear, antelope and 
elk hunters must have applications in to the DFG License and Revenue Branch 
office in Sacramento by 5 p.m. June 26 to be eligible for the July computerized 
drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Deer tags for A, B, D, and archery-only hunt applications are available over 
the counter at DFG offices in Long Beach, San Diego and Fresno or by mail from 
the Sacramento license office. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
Grunion season has reopened after a two-month closing to allow the fish to 
spawn uninhibited. The next runs are expected to be during the late nights of 
June 20-23 along dark, sandy beaches. San Pedro's Cabrillo Marine Museum will 
hold its final two grunion programs -- with films, lectures and the actual 
viewing of a grunion run -- July 3 and 20 beginning at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Silvio Calabi of Rod &amp; Reel magazine will present a show on the World Fly 
Fishing Championships, held last fall in Tasmania, at the Sierra Pacific 
Flyfishers' meeting June 22 at the Odyssey Restaurant in Mission Hills. The 
program follows a 7:30 p.m. dinner. For details, call (818) 785-7306. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth annual Invitational Benefit Stag Shoot for Hoag Hospital in Newport 
Beach will be held today from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Coto de Caza Hunt Lodge 
in Orange County. Olympian Dan Carlisle will give a shooting demonstration 
before the competition. . . . Hunting season for cottontail rabbits begins July 
1 with the best prospects, according to the DFG, to be in "areas adjacent to 
agricultural lands where water and feed are generally available."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

APPIER'S FIRST VICTORY LEADS KANSAS CITY, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Appier could not wait to call home after winning his first major league 
game, as the Kansas City Royals defeated the Oakland Athletics, 5-3, Tuesday 
night at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
A first-round draft pick in 1987, Appier (1-1) went five innings and gave up 
two runs on seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to call my family in Lancaster," Appier said. "They'll all be 
there waiting to hear all about it. My mom, my wife, everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great. I wasn't really too nervous. I was just trying to concentrate 
on making the right pitches." 
</P>
<P>
The Royals' sixth consecutive victory moved Kansas City to within 1 1/2 games 
of the first-place Athletics in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Appier threw a great game," Kansas City Manager John Wathan said. "Especially 
considering it was such a big game. To come out and throw the way he did 
against the top team in the league was impressive." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Boone's three-run double in the second inning gave Appier a lead. The 
Royals were aided by Oakland's two errors. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Farr, the fourth Kansas City pitcher, pitched the ninth for his 14th 
save. Curt Young dropped to 2-6 with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 8, Detroit 7 -- Danny Heep had three singles and drove in three runs as 
the Red Sox used 16 hits and two Tiger errors to win at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox overcame a dismal pitching performance by starter John Dopson, who 
tied a league record by committing four balks. Dopson, whose 11 balks lead the 
majors, gave up five runs on six hits and five walks in 3 2/3 innings. One run 
scored on a balk and another on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Heep, who had only 11 RBIs in 95 games with the Dodgers last year, drove in a 
run in the first and two more in the second. His third single in the fourth set 
up a run that scored on third baseman Rick Schu's fielding error, putting 
Boston ahead to stay, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 4, Seattle 3 -- Al Newman singled home the winning run with one out 
in the 11th inning to lead the Twins at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins, who tied the score with a run in the ninth, won it against Jerry 
Reed (3-4). Gary Gaetti led off the 11th with a single and took third on a 
single by Randy Bush. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Reed intentionally walked Gene Larkin to load the bases. Newman 
followed with a single over right fielder Jay Buhner. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Wayne won his first career decision. Wayne pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings 
and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 5, New York 2 -- Joe Orsulak singled home the go-ahead run in the 
sixth inning to lead the East-leading Orioles at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Milligan and Bob Melvin singled with one out and Orsulak followed with a 
hit-and-run single that gave the Orioles a 3-1 lead in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Schmidt (6-5), gave up one run on five hits in six innings. Mark 
Williamson relieved in the seventh and the Yankees scored on singles by Ken 
Phelps, Mike Pagliarulo and Don Slaught. Gregg Olson pitched the final inning 
for his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
Orsulak hit an RBI double in the eighth that finished Dave LaPoint (6-5) and 
scored on a groundout by Worthington. LaPoint gave up 13 hits in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 9, Chicago 6 -- Dave Clark ended a 2-for-30 slump with four hits, 
including a two-run single during a five-run third inning, leading Greg 
Swindell and the Indians at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell (8-1), had a five-hit shutout until Carlton Fisk hit his third home 
run of the season in the seventh. Swindell was chased during a five-run eighth 
and Doug Jones worked the ninth for his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Milwaukee 3 -- Pinch-hitter Kelly Gruber's solo home run in the 
ninth inning lifted the Blue Jays at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Whitt singled with one out in the ninth, but pinch-runner Kevin Batiste 
was picked off. Gruber, scratched from the starting lineup because of a sore 
throat, hit Dan Plesac's next pitch for his sixth home run.

BRAY LOSES BOUT IN MEET AGAINST SOVIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavyweight Viktor Akshonov of the Soviet Union won a unanimous 3-0 decision 
over John Bray of Van Nuys on Tuesday, helping the U.S.S.R. to a 5-5 tie with 
the United States in the USA-USSR Amateur Boxing Dual in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Akshonov, 199 pounds, was able to cut off the ring and peppered Bray, 201, with 
left jabs and hooks. There were no knockdowns in the three-round bout, but an 
Akshonov left jab snapped Bray's head back and a standing eight count was 
ordered with 12 seconds left in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
Akshonov, the 1988 Soviet heavyweight champion, had the advantage of experience 
over Bray. Akshonov is 27; Bray, ranked third by the USA Amateur Boxing 
Federation, will turn 19 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The United States seemed headed for a win, capturing the first five fights. But 
the Soviets won the last five, with light middleweight Dimitri Korsun taking a 
2-1 decision from Paul Vaden of Puyallup, Wash., in the final bout. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have dominated the series, which began in 1969, winning 33 times 
while losing seven. There have been four ties.

VALENCIA WELL-POSITIONED TO HELP RESEDA 
</P>

Mario Valencia has done just fine for a guy who never really made it to first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
When Cleveland High opened its doors to its first freshman class in 1985 -- it 
was previously a three-year school -- Valencia was included in the incoming 
crop, although at 5-foot-6 and 130 pounds he was more akin to a weed. By the 
end of his freshman season, however, Valencia had played eight positions -- 
everywhere but first base. 
</P>
<P>
"Being 5-6 or 5-7, whatever I was then, it just didn't work out at first," 
Valencia said. "But I kind of filled in wherever they needed me." 
</P>
<P>
Filled in like cement. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, who will graduate from Cleveland next week, became the first 
four-year letterman -- indeed, the first four-year starter -- in the history of 
the program. And after two weeks of play for Reseda's American Legion team, he 
has once again proved his versatility. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically plays wherever I ask him to," Reseda Coach Frank Des Enfants 
said. "Sometimes I don't even know where I'm going to put him. He never whines, 
he just goes out there and does his job." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Valencia has played pitcher, shortstop, left field and catcher for 
Reseda (5-2 in District 20 play). 
</P>
<P>
A 5-7, 140-pound catcher? Care to try your luck? 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Encino-Crespi baserunners tested Valencia three times in the 
first two innings. The result was three consecutive 2-to-4 putouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, that's where I like it best," Valencia said. "I think I 
call a pretty good game back there. With a pitcher, it's not just how hard you 
throw, but where you put it and what you throw." 
</P>
<P>
Too bad Valencia can't call his own game. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda pitchers other than Valencia have allowed four earned runs and compiled 
an earned-run average of less than 1.00. Valencia, who will start at 5:15 p.m. 
today against Woodland Hills West at El Camino Real High, has allowed five 
earned runs in 13 innings and is 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, however, Valencia leads the team with a .458 average (11 for 24). 
He also tops the team in doubles (three), stolen bases (five) and runs batted 
in (eight). 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised if he plays every position before the season's over," 
Des Enfants said. "Not because we'll intentionally put him everywhere, but 
because before this is over we'll probably have a need for him everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Gearing up: After three seasons as a starter at Westlake High, Mike Lieberthal 
is building a head of steam heading into his senior season in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal is 12 for 33 with three doubles, six home runs and 21 RBIs for 
District 16 entry Westlake-Agoura (6-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Last season at Westlake High, he hit .408 with four home runs and 16 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Habit of winning: For the fourth time in as many games, Sun Valley (6-1 in 
District 20) won in its last at-bat, continuing its last-minute madness with a 
doubleheader sweep of Foothill Valley on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Sun Valley eked out one-run decisions against Panorama City and 
Glendale and twice beat Foothill Valley. 
</P>
<P>
How hot is this team? Sun Valley trailed, 4-3, with two out in the seventh 
inning in Sunday's opener against Foothill Valley when right-handed-batting 
Harold Whiteside singled in two runs to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Whiteside was hitting without a contact lens in his left eye. He 
lost it while playing in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"They could just as easily have been four losses," Sun Valley Coach Les Riley 
said of the streak. "We better start waking up on time real soon." 
</P>
<P>
No kidding. Next week, Sun Valley plays Woodland Hills East, Woodland Hills 
West and Newhall-Saugus, all among the favorites to win their respective 
divisional titles. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome back: As a junior, infielder Ricky Banuelos was a reserve on the Canoga 
Park High team that won the 1987 City Section 4-A baseball title. As a senior, 
he was a starter. Last season, he did not play college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
After Banuelos' first week of playing for Woodland Hill West, Coach Gary Gibson 
must be wondering why. 
</P>
<P>
In his first 10 at-bats, Banuelos had seven hits. After six games, Banuelos is 
11 for 19 with a team-high 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Add Sun Valley: Right-hander Eddie Chavez -- who led area City Section 
relievers with four saves -- still knows how to pick his spots. 
</P>
<P>
In two relief appearances totaling four innings Sunday, he picked up two wins. 
</P>
<P>
Picking the wrong spots: It hasn't all been good news for Sun Valley -- the 
team lost two leadoff hitters last week. 
</P>
<P>
Shad Martinez broke his left wrist playing pick-up basketball Wednesday and 
John Campbell strained a tendon in his left wrist against Glendale last 
Saturday. The two had combined to steal nine bases in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Winning understudy: Newhall-Saugus right-hander Roger Salkeld's failure to show 
for his team's doubleheader with Burbank on Sunday didn't rattle Glenn Terry. 
</P>
<P>
Terry (6-3, 210 pounds) threw a one-hitter, struck out six and walked one as 
Newhall-Saugus (4-1) beat Burbank, 1-0. He carried a perfect game into the 
fifth inning.

HIGH SCHOOL REVIEW / SCOTT MILLER; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYOFFS WILL SAY SO LONG TO BYES IN THE FIRST ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Miller 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First-round byes will be eliminated in next year's San Diego Section football, 
baseball and girls' volleyball playoffs because each sport will increase its 
number of playoff participants from 12 teams to 16. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Section Coordinating Council voted for the increase last week 
after a recommendation from the Playoff Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some concern about loss of momentum (as the playoffs started)," said 
Kendall Webb, San Diego Section commissioner. "Some teams had to wait longer 
than they wanted to before playing." 
</P>
<P>
John Shacklett, who coached the Morse football team to the 3-A championship 
last fall, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like that week layoff," Shacklett said. "You don't need it. Plus, this 
gives a few more teams the opportunity to play in the playoffs. We've been 
playing a 16-team format with 12 teams anyway." 
</P>
<P>
There will be no extra time involved because the increase in teams simply means 
the elimination of first-round byes rather than added dates. But it will mean 
some extra money to the schools who would have had byes. The section allows 
schools that play host to first-round football and volleyball playoff games and 
the first and second rounds in basketball to keep the profits (the policy for 
basketball is different because there are more rounds). 
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc committee chaired by Frank Cranley, superintendent of the Imperial 
school district, is coming up with specific proposals regarding sports violence 
in the section. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is creating codes of ethics and conduct with specific penalties 
for violators. 
</P>
<P>
There were several outbreaks of violence this year in San Diego, most notably a 
15-minute bench-clearing brawl during the 3-A baseball championship game 
between Mt. Carmel and Helix. 
</P>
<P>
"The brawl in the 3-A championship game was illustrative of a problem that is 
growing larger and larger," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said the proposals probably will be discussed at the Board of Managers 
meeting Tuesday, refined, sent to the leagues for review and then be 
implemented at the first Board of Managers meeting for the 1989-90 school year 
next October. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel and Patrick Henry were the local winners in last week's major league 
baseball free agent draft. Mt. Carmel had five current and former players 
drafted, Patrick Henry four. 
</P>
<P>
From Mt. Carmel: Miah Bradbury (Philadelphia), John Tejcek (Oakland), Dan 
Rumsey (San Francisco), Marcus Lee (Houston) and Kevin Lofthus (Oakland). 
Tejcek and Lee played on Mt. Carmel's 3-A championship team this year. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry's contributions: Kasey McKeon (Detroit), Cory Powell (Montreal), 
Kevin Tahan (St. Louis) and Mike Romberg (Montreal). All graduated previously. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Chris Riley led Madison to a second-place finish in the Southern 
California high school team golf championships. Madison, the San Diego Section 
team champion, shot a team total 389 and finished one shot behind West 
Bakersfield at the Bakersfield Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Riley finished sixth in the individual championship with a five-over par 149 
for two rounds. He was the highest finishing boy from the section; Chris 
Stewart of Valhalla was seventh at 152. Madison has never won the tournament 
since it was started in 1971, but also finished second in 1972 and 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Coaching carrousel: Grossmont softball Coach Steve Sutton, a 15-year veteran at 
the school, will coach varsity football and softball at Santee's West Hills 
High School. The school opened just two years ago with a freshman class and now 
will start varsity competition in the Grossmont 2-A League with its first 
junior class. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Oder, Fallbrook track and field coach, has resigned after seven years as 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Both are leaving as champions. Fallbrook won the section boys' track and field 
championship this year, and Grossmont won its first section softball title.

JACK SMITH: A QUESTION THAT'S AS LARGE AS LIFE ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The question What is the meaning of life? is unanswerable, but that doesn't 
keep people from trying. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the answers I have received, however, merely turn the question in upon 
itself, something like the late physicist Richard Feynmen's verse: 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why I wonder why 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why I wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 John Martin of Palmdale holds that there is only one answer -- perpetuation of 
the species. "With that accomplished," he says, "life per se becomes academic." 
</P>
<P>
John M. Freter recalls the story of a young man seeking the answer who made his 
way to an aged guru who was said to know. "'What, great teacher," the young man 
asked, "is the meaning of life?" The old man whispered, "Life is like a 
barrel." Incredulous, the young man shouted, "Life is like a barrel!" And the 
old man answered, "All right already. So life isn't like a barrel." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Coil of Laguna Hills reminds us that the most important beings on Earth are 
the worms, for without their tilling of the soil there could be no other life. 
"And the real truth is that the real truth will still remain the real truth, 
whatever that may be, no matter how loudly we disbelieve it." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Cavaliere of Beverly Hills makes the point that all the persons I quoted 
on the meaning of life from Life magazine's article on the subject were men. "A 
woman, of course," he adds, "does not have to ask the question." (Of the 50 
persons quoted by Life, only eight were women.) 
</P>
<P>
To correct that imbalance somewhat, let me quote one of them now. Writer 
Jamaica Kincaid was quoted as saying, "If anyone should absolutely, definitely, 
truthfully find out why we are here, please do not tell me. If I were to 
really, really know, I feel certain that I should then ask, 'Please, may I now 
leave?' " 
</P>
<P>
Gennie Bone of Banning suggests that a slogan painted on trash containers in 
Australia is the answer: "Do what's right." First, we have to know what's 
right. 
</P>
<P>
David P. Lewis thinks the answer comes from a go-go dancer who has the last 
lines in a play he recently finished. 
</P>
<P>
She says: "You want a happy ending, Larry? Try another world. In this one there 
are no endings, happy or otherwise. Every day you pick up the pieces of 
yesterday and try to put them together so you can make it through to 
sleepy-time tonight, and be ready for another go in the morning, which just 
leaves you wasted and wondering what all the excitement was about; and hoping 
that somehow tomorrow will be better. So all you can do is keep on dancing, and 
try a new step from time to time and pray to God somebody applauds." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Gottesman, trying to answer the question for a 9-year-old, put it in verse: 
</P>
<P>
 Why has the void been disturbed? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are there children at play? 
</P>
<P>
 Why has the chaos been curbed? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are there crows? Why croquet? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are there gaggles of geese? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of just googols of zeros? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are there Popes and police 
</P>
<P>
 And pills for digestion and Neros? 
</P>
<P>
 Why is there Something, not Nothing? 
</P>
<P>
 Stand by for the mystery unmasked! 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem to appear 
</P>
<P>
 There is Something, my dear, 
</P>
<P>
 So the question you ask can be asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous readers expressed sadness that I overlooked the Bible. Don Kellogg of 
Playa del Rey writes, "Someone should tell Jack Smith that if he wanted to know 
the meaning of life, he was wasting his time asking mankind. His creator has 
been trying to give him the answer for thousands of years. The answer is in a 
book called the Holy Bible." 
</P>
<P>
M. Yancey of Fallbrook recalls that when a woman told pianist Vladimir Horowitz 
that she didn't care for the music he had played, but that it was outstanding 
when he played it, Horowitz replied: "Madam, it doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
As antidote for all this cynicism, I'll end on a note of sweetness and light by 
quoting Louise Peebles, whose husband, Byron, is recovering from heart bypass 
surgery, an event that has caused her to reflect on the meaning of life: 
</P>
<P>
"To freely give and receive the love of other human beings and to appreciate 
and protect the glorious planet on which we live." 
</P>
<P>
Amen.

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: AMBASZ'S MYTHICAL VISION EVIDENT AT LA JOLLA EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Saturday night, a diminutive, fashionably dressed man strode to the podium 
at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art's Sherwood Auditorium and announced 
that architect and designer Emilio Ambasz, the subject of the museum's new 
exhibition and the evening's scheduled lecturer, could not attend. The man said 
he was an acquaintance standing in. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the man went on to say, there is no Emilio Ambasz. Instead, there are 
two creators who occasionally collaborate. There is Ambasz, who designs 
practical objects such as chairs, razors, lighting systems and diesel engines 
-- useful things for people. Then there is Emilio, the architect who wants his 
buildings "to be received by angels." 
</P>
<P>
This mythical approach to architecture, as well as Ambasz's profound reverence 
for nature, make his work feel like a fresh gust blowing through spec-built 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Americans seem hungry for what Ambasz has to offer. At one point during his 
talk (nobody was fooled by his introduction), the crowd cheered after he showed 
photos of a hotel lobby in Lugano, Switzerland, an abstract diorama of 
mountains, sky and clouds. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he told the audience, "architecture and design are myth-making 
arts." He then proceeded to talk about the ideas that have made him one of the 
world's most innovative and prolific designers. For the quality of his work, he 
is also one of the least known. 
</P>
<P>
On the industrial side, Ambasz estimated he holds 150 to 180 design patents for 
products, ranging from a flexible ballpoint pen to ergonomically sound razors, 
toothbrushes and flashlights, many of them still in the development stage. One 
of his crowning achievements in industry was the redesign of a Cummins diesel 
engine. He cooled it with oil instead of water, which made it more compact and 
longer-lasting, and designed it with a sleek, flat-black exterior he hoped 
would leave "smitten truck drivers swooning." 
</P>
<P>
Among his buildings, the Lucile Halsell Conservatory, a recently completed 
botanical garden in San Antonio, Tex., is becoming a photogenic darling of the 
design world. A main distinguishing feature is an Ambasz trademark: the way 
most of the building space is covered with rolling green landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Argentina-born Ambasz is no Ralph Waldo Emerson. "I'm a city jungle 
boy," he confessed. "Give me seven days of nature and I get sick of it." Of his 
fascination with nature, the way he often camouflages projects beneath 
landscaping, he said: "I'm doing this for other people. If I'm going to build, 
I have to ask permission of the place. I have to fold the building into what 
existed." 
</P>
<P>
At the Texas project, stunning glass pavilions erupt through the carpet of 
green like primeval geology in the making. The largest is conical and houses 
giant palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Also typically Ambasz is the way the visitor enters the garden, through a 
carefully choreographed series of enclosures strung out in a long, straight 
line, a formal procession borrowing heavily from the architecture of ancient 
Greece and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The entry is through an opening in a wall holding back the earth above the 
structure. Then comes a circular courtyard decorated with a single tree, a 
corridor, the first pavilion and, finally, a courtyard ringed by exhibit rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Ambasz loves the cloistered courtyard -- giving a building's users a controlled 
slice of Eden at the heart of a project, while the exterior often presents 
blank walls. 
</P>
<P>
His project list is worldwide, including a new department store and 30-story 
twin towers in Japan, the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City, a 
Mercedes-Benz showroom in New Jersey, a planned computer research center in 
Mexico City and the interiors for branches of the Banque Bruxelles Lambert in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Ambasz's mythical architecture remains mostly mythical to date. 
The San Antonio project is the only built and photographed design. He said a 
house in Spain, for a secretive and wealthy couple, has also been built, but no 
one connected with the show has seen any evidence. Even Lynda Forsha, the 
museum curator who put the show together, seemed unsure about whether to take 
Ambasz's word on the house. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of myths surrounding it, and no one's sure if it's built," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese high-rises are under construction, Ambasz said, and, according to 
Forsha, a cultural center and department store in Japan appear close to 
breaking ground. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere, however, the La Jolla exhibit ought to make it more clear that 
Ambasz's architecture remains largely unrealized. 
</P>
<P>
His designs include houses that consist of rooms around a sunken courtyard 
concealed behind a high, L-shaped wall of rough white stucco. But he says he 
doesn't want residential work right now. 
</P>
<P>
"That requires a very deep relationship with a client. I perhaps am not mature 
enough. Perhaps when I'm older and wiser." 
</P>
<P>
Ambasz has strong feelings about what an architect's priorities must be, and 
why much of contemporary urban America has been built up in mediocre fashion. 
In America, big business is too driven by the pressures of Wall Street to 
invest in revolutionary designs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"American corporations want every investment to pay off in the next quarter. 
There's no long-range vision." 
</P>
<P>
We could learn from the examples of Italy, he said. Italian industry is 
committed to quality and innovations in design, not pricing. Wealthy Italian 
financiers appreciate good design. A competent design press keeps the public 
aware of the latest trends. And middle-class Italians are quite different from 
middle-class Americans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who cleans his New York apartment, he said, might come across an 
unusual design object and react with, "Move this." His cleaning woman in Italy 
would probably remark, "How beautiful!" 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly could go to an Italian client and say a project's beauty is reason 
enough to do it, and they'll find a way to do it," he said. That won't often 
work in America. 
</P>
<P>
The architect or designer should "believe you have to posit alternative 
solutions," regardless of the expected reaction of the client or the financial 
feasibility. 
</P>
<P>
This no-holds-barred creativity is what allows him to come up with ideas such 
as his competition-winning master plan for the 1992 Universal Exposition in 
Seville, Spain, a world expo celebrating the 500th anniversary of Columbus' 
discovery of America. 
</P>
<P>
Ambasz decided that the most important thing was what Seville would be like 
after the exposition. So he created a series of man-made lagoons in which 
exhibits would have floated on barges. When the expo was done, the barges would 
motor away down the Guadalquivir River, leaving a pristine public park for the 
people of Seville. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this, too, is among the great Ambasz designs never to be built, 
Forsha said, adding that it remains unclear what political forces vetoed his 
winning scheme, or even whether some other design has taken its place. 
</P>
<P>
Ambasz has had an unusual and precocious path to the height of his myth making. 
He polished off the undergraduate program in architecture at Princeton in a 
year and, by the end of the next, had completed the master's. He was curator of 
design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from 1970 to 1976, where he 
curated shows on Italian design and Mexican architect Luis Barragan, among 
others. He has maintained offices in New York and Bologna, Italy, since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Ambasz is hoping that the attention he gets from this traveling show 
and from national media attention paid to the San Antonio project will help him 
rise from the ranks of the paper architects. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla exhibition includes architectural models, drawings and 
photographs, as well as many of Ambasz's product designs: the revolutionary 
Vertebra chair and its cousins, lighting systems and much more. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Museum Director Hugh Davies, who took classes from Ambasz at 
Princeton, had wanted to do a show of his work for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
The excellent exhibit installation was designed by Japanese architect Shigeru 
Ban, who concealed each object behind a folding paper screen. 
</P>
<P>
After its La Jolla premiere, which lasts through Aug. 6, the exhibit will tour 
internationally through the end of 1991.

NBC finished first in the weekly ratings for the 51st consecutive week, the 
A.C. Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday, but without the usual strong showing by "The 
Cosby Show." Delayed in much of the country by President Bush's news conference 
last Thursday, "The Cosby Show" finished out of the Top 10 for the first time 
since December, 1987, when Christmas Eve fell on Thursday. Ratings for the 
nightly network newscasts, meanwhile, were up a combined 14% over the preceding 
week, perhaps reflecting the public's interest in the turmoil in China. The 
full list of prime-time ratings is on Page 7.

<P>
* Fox Broadcasting's crime-busting series was the second-most-watched program 
in its time period Sunday, losing to CBS' "Murder, She Wrote" but outdrawing 
the offerings on NBC and ABC.

JAZZ FOR JUNIORS: Youngsters ages 5-13 will get an hourlong jazz concert of 
their own when pianists Steve Allen, Pete Jolly, Paul Smith and Mark Massey get 
together Saturday at 3 p.m. at the La Mirada Civic Theatre. The pianists will 
perform at the theater that evening in a joint benefit for the Children's 
Museum at La Habra and the youth programs of the La Mirada Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Since entertainers always have a rehearsal, we asked the musicians to open it 
up and make it a performance for children, and they said they'd love to do it," 
said Marcia Giesler, director of development for the museum, a hands-on 
facility that serves more than 100,000 youths from Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties a year. 
</P>
<P>
The children's concert is free, but tickets -- available on a first-come, 
first-served basis -- must be obtained in advance, either in person at the La 
Mirada Civic Theatre box office, 14900 La Mirada Blvd., La Mirada, or by 
writing to the theater. Giesler stressed that this is a children's concert and 
that only one adult for every four children will be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old museum -- whose purpose, Giesler said, "is to make the world a 
little less intimidating for children" -- is undergoing a building expansion 
project and its directors plan to spend the evening concert's proceeds on the 
construction of a new wing. Information: (213) 905-9793, 944-9801. 
</P>

C-SPAN, the U.S.-based cable network that carries House and Senate proceedings, 
said Tuesday it will air portions of sessions at Britain's House of Commons 
starting this fall. After resisting the invasion of cameras for three decades, 
the House of Commons Monday night endorsed a tightly-scripted plan for live 
television by a vote of 293-69. Parliament, often the scene of rowdy debates, 
will be televised for nine months starting with the State Opening by the Queen 
in November. Members will then decide whether to make the experiment permanent. 
"Coverage should give an unvarnished account of the proceedings of the House, 
free of subjective commentary and editing techniques designed to produce 
entertainment rather than information," said a parliamentary committee that set 
the rules. That means no cut-aways to "occasions of grave disorder" or 
demonstrations from the visitors' gallery. Only head-and-shoulder shots of 
members of Parliament will be permitted. House of Commons proceedings are 
already broadcast on the radio. The more sedate upper chamber of Parliament, 
the House of Lords, has been on television for the last four years. C-SPAN 
started coverage of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979 and of the Senate 
in 1986. ALEENE MacMINN

Singer-actress-dancer Mitzi Gaynor will hit the road this fall, starring in a 
national tour of the Tony Award-winning Lincoln Center production of "Anything 
Goes." The tour will be launched here Sept. 12 at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, then go on to such cities as Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, St. Louis, 
Cleveland, Toronto, Denver, Louisville, Miami, Nashville and Seattle. Zerry 
Zaks' original direction will be re-created for the Gaynor tour by Philip 
Cusack, who also directed an international company of the Cole Porter show. 
Tony Walton's original costumes and scenic design will be featured, with Bob 
Mackie doing Gaynor's costumes. Choreography will be by Tony-winner Thommie 
Walsh. The score for "Anything Goes" includes "I Get a Kick Out of You," "Blow, 
Gabriel, Blow," "All Through the Night" and "You're the Top," in addition to 
the title tune. ALEENE MacMINN

'OYE' BRINGS THE PASSION OF MUSIC, DANCE OUT OF AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELLEY BAUMSTEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Producer Mel Howard proposes an alternative to "Africa Oye," his pan-African 
music and dance revue. To see ritual music and dance in Central Africa, for 
example, he suggests: "Hire a Jeep. Drive 3,000 kilometers (about 1,700 miles) 
into the country. No motels along the way. Wait for someone to die. Then hope 
you get invited to the funeral." 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, would give you a taste of the show, opening Saturday at the 
Pantages Theatre. Attractions will include Peul acrobats from Guinea, Pygmy 
musicians from Northern Zaire, griots (the storytellers-poets-singers who are 
the keepers of history and culture in African societies) and an African pop 
star. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the show presents 50 performers in what Howard describes as "a voyage 
-- 2 1/2 hours spent crossing Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Seen in video clips, the revue boasts phenomenally long-winded flautists, 
break-dancing acrobats in billowing pantaloons, and various groups of dancers 
wrapped head-to-toe in raffia, swathed in animal skins, and decked out in lame 
skirts and bandeaux. 
</P>
<P>
Howard and co-producer/artistic director Michel Boudon say they spent two years 
working on "Africa Oye." Boudon has spent the last 18 years as adviser to 
African and French ministries of culture and overseeing presentations of 
African music and dance in Europe. Howard's credentials as a producer include 
"Tango Argentino," "Flamenco Puro" and the recent Tony winner, "Black and 
Blue." He also has presented the National Dance Company of Senegal for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Both regard African music and dance as "a passion" and both describe "Africa 
Oye" as absolutely authentic material presented as entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Since music and dance at traditional rites and celebrations are usually 
performed for hours on end, they had to be trimmed for theatrical presentation. 
"We don't want to distort or bastardize what people have done for thousands of 
years," Howard said, "so we looked for groups where the material doesn't rely 
on a slow build and editing doesn't ruin the performance." 
</P>
<P>
Programming choices were influenced by politics. "We were considering Nubians 
and Ethiopians," Howard said, "but people who are at war (with one another) 
couldn't be expected to share the same hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the situation in Ethiopia is so terrible that we couldn't get the 
Ethiopians out at all." 
</P>
<P>
Border conflicts that closed the airport at Dakar coupled with a hold-up on 
visas nearly prevented the producers from getting any of the cast out of 
Africa. At the last minute, Howard said, U.S. Immigration officials demanded 
documentation to prove the "exceptional merit and ability" of the entire cast. 
With none of the usual press clippings available on these artists, Howard 
enlisted the aid of such political heavyweights as Sen. Edward Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) to call off the bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
According to the producers, some of the performers are worldly urbanites and 
some have never ventured outside their immediate communities or performed in a 
theater. In some cases, permission to leave had to be secured from tribal 
chiefs and the performers hired workers to stand in for them at planting and 
harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks of rehearsal in Dakar helped acclimate the rural people to paved 
roads, high-rise buildings and elevators. One Pende tribesman came to grief 
when he ignored a makeshift barricade and stepped into an empty elevator shaft. 
"Fortunately," said Howard, "it was just one floor from the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
Now at the halfway point, the three-month North American tour has otherwise 
gone smoothly. Howard admires the troupe's "adaptability, astounding stage 
intelligence and patience. They calmly wait hours for their turn, then set 
themselves on fire in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"My greatest fear was 'What's going to happen when they really get cooking and 
they hear the applause and cheers? Are they going to forget to stop?' " The 
solution? "To have the next group start the music on top of them." 
</P>
<P>
In other matters, the performers make the rules. At home, the griots, sorcerers 
and chiefs are guardians of ancient cultures and mysteries. No one has yet seen 
the Mbulie-Hemba apply their elaborate makeup and costumes, Howard said. "It's 
a private ritual no matter where they dress and no one is allowed to watch. And 
with the Pende we never know who's under which mask." 
</P>
<P>
Boudon emphasizes that the music and dance of "Africa Oye" represents an 
ancient but vital culture. "These traditions bind the individual to the group 
and to nature. It's not just folklore. Their roots enable them to exist and to 
resist the encroachments of the outside world. I hope the show convinces people 
to study Africa."

HUW LEWIS IN RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his approach to music of the Romantic era, organist Huw Lewis certainly 
likes to pull out some of the more spectacular stops. Monday night at the First 
United Methodist Church in Pasadena, a solo concert by the Welsh-born musician 
demonstrated a comanding showmanship in a program dominated by some very 
demanding 19th-Century works. 
</P>
<P>
Although the evening offered standard fare with no real surprises, Lewis 
performed with flair and finesse, evoking a broad spectrum of emotional 
intensities. His technique flowed seamlessly while well-chosen registrations 
avoided the easy temptation of bombast. 
</P>
<P>
Julius Reubke's ambitious, precocious Organ Sonata was the centerpiece of the 
evening. Based on the 94th Psalm and influenced by the Romantic 
transcendentalism of Liszt, the three-part sonata tested Lewis' versatility 
with contrasts and dynamic levels representing the many moods of a vengeful 
God. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-rank, Romantic-style instrument at hand provided the necessary resources 
to bring out sforzando trumpets while at other times expressing a delicate 
pianissimo. Lewis met each virtuosic demand of the multifaceted score, and kept 
the pace fresh and vital. 
</P>
<P>
In two pieces by Widor, the second movement from "Symphonie Gothique" and the 
first movement from Symphony No. 6, Lewis again took advantage of the grandiose 
organ and its capabilities. Passages demanding difficult pedalling seemed 
effortless. 
</P>
<P>
Warm-up performances of Bach's Toccata, Adagio and Fugue in C and Mozart's 
Adagio and Allegro in F minor completed the program with minor flaws. Lewis' 
approach to the Baroque and Classical sensibilities was appropriate, although 
an abundant use of tremolo created a less convincing aspect.GREGG WAGER

SPANISH GUITARIST RAFAEL RIQUENI MAKES L.A. DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An under-promoted "Celebration of Modern Flamenco and World Music" -- produced 
by the ambitious, home-spun Flamenco and World Music Society -- seems to have 
had little impact on the local music consciousness, if the almost endearingly 
amateurish finale Monday evening at the Wilshire Ebell Concert Hall was any 
indication. 
</P>
<P>
But the central figure of the celebration was Rafael Riqueni, a young Spanish 
guitarist of truly phenomenal abilities. Though accomplished in distinctly 
minor circumstances, his local debut proved a major event artistically. 
</P>
<P>
Riqueni also demonstrated that flamenco nuevo is not entirely lost to fusion 
lures. Though certainly no slave to the past, he showed a healthy respect for 
the traditional character of forms such as soleares, siguiriyas, bulerias and 
fandangos. Though the name and spirit of Paco de Lucia were frequently invoked, 
Riqueni's controlled classicism seems to derive more from the influence of Paco 
Pena. 
</P>
<P>
He played with uncommon clarity, and his technique reflected the logic of his 
well-ordered creations and adaptations of classically influenced predecessors 
such as Ramon Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
Riqueni was quite capable of bravura bursts of rhythmic fire, but he also 
played with delicacy and finesse, emphasizing supremely articulate tremolo 
throughout two sets. Indeed, pieces like his Garrotin -- an almost 
Kreisler-esque fantasy of elegant wit -- would not be out of place on a 
classical recital. 
</P>
<P>
Fusion trends were much more apparent in the short introductory sets of Alberto 
de Almar, the Flamenco and World Music Society impresario who also took tickets 
and set up the stage. His playing, heavy and technically forced at times, 
peaked interpretively in a Tarantas. He was at his most inventive, however, 
when he reduced his guitar to pure percussion. 
</P>
<P>
The leisurely program ended with a single, extended cuadro flamenco ensemble 
number. Lea Santos sang "Come, My Love" in English and a husky, fervent 
contralto, while the monomial Lourdes took a few tentative dance steps across 
the small crowded stage. That effort died when she knocked a microphone into 
Riqueni, whose lightning solo leads drove the piece.JOHN HENKEN

'TRAPPED': HIGH-RISE TERROR ON USA NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Trapped" (9-11 tonight on cable's USA Network) is a tightly wrought thriller 
distinguished by its frequent use of the subjective eye (or camera "I," if you 
will) -- in this case visual angles that catch the terrified point of view of a 
woman stalked by a killer in a high-rise office building. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Quinlan, as a management executive in a 63-story complex still under 
construction, fills a cliche role with chills. Working too late one night, she 
finds herself locked in the sprawling skyscraper with all the telephones dead, 
not to mention her secretary and a heartless CEO whose toxic waste dumping has 
triggered the killer's dementia. 
</P>
<P>
Director and co-writer Fred Walton delivers a basic primer in taut suspense. 
The craftmanship is assured, careening between first- and third-person 
storytelling, creating terror in elevators, parking areas, rooftops and marble 
corridors. Here is a genre thriller notable not for what you see but for what 
you feel and hear. 
</P>
<P>
The opening sequence, for example, perfectly and wordlessly sets up the 
killer's motive and concludes with an outrageous image: The camera pans to an 
eerie closeup of somebody's face that looks strangely asleep until, through 
half open lips, a cockroach emerges from the mouth. Once in the high-rise, it's 
George Koblasa's lensing and David Lloyd's editing, not dialogue by Walton and 
co-writer Steve Feke, that propel the story. The killer, brandishing his 
weapons of choice, a baseball bat and a dagger, is mirrored in quick, crazed 
flashes through the eyes of Quinlan. Adding to the suspense is a major third 
character, an industrial spy (nicely played by Bruce Abbott) who, inadvertently 
caught in the killer's web, teams up with Quinlan in a cat-and-mouse run for 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The quiet sound track, the vengeful, wordless madman (Ben Loggins), and even 
the building itself (the show was shot in Dallas) coalesce into a jumpy 
catharsis. True film noir buffs, by the way, will be deliciously reminded of 
the then-controversial 1947 Robert Montgomery MGM chiller, "Lady in the Lake" 
(with Audrey Totter and Jayne Meadows), whose entire story was subjectively 
seen through the eyes of Montgomery's Philip Marlowe.

TERROR FELT IN HOMELAND SPREADS TO U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after 18,000 demonstrators rallied outside the United Nations and the 
Chinese Consulate in New York in support of the pro-democracy movement in 
China, the consulate's education officer showed up at a dormitory at the State 
University of New York at Stony Brook. He began questioning Chinese exchange 
students. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat wanted to know who might have participated in the demonstration. 
He also questioned Chinese graduate students in an apartment complex on campus. 
For many of the 400 Chinese nationals on temporary visas at the university, the 
reaction was fear and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday night visit by the Chinese official demonstrated how the terror felt 
in China in the wake of the government's violent suppression of the student 
movement has begun spreading to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese diplomats have videotaped demonstrators in San Francisco, Los Angeles 
and Washington, protesters said. Threatening phone calls and warnings not to 
take part in future rallies also have been reported, inspiring fear among the 
students for their own futures and for their families at home. 
</P>
<P>
"They are watching us," said Qi Anming, a student leader at UC Berkeley. "I am 
not afraid, but others are." 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to silence the people is to give them a sense of fear," added Yu 
Maochun, a student at the same university. "Fear is the traditional way in 
China of controlling people." 
</P>
<P>
Yu quoted an old Chinese saying: "Kill the chicken to frighten the monkey." In 
today's context, it means intimidating the masses by attacking just a few, he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Qi said students are worried that their involvement in protests in the United 
States will bring hardship to their families in China. Many are concerned that 
their parents will lose their jobs, be harassed by government officials or face 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The students wonder if they could face the same fate as their classmates in 
China should they return. "In the eyes of the Chinese government, we are 
counterrevolutionaries. It means they can do anything to us," Qi said. 
</P>
<P>
At Stony Brook, some students quickly complained to Lynn King Morris, the 
university's director of foreign student affairs. "They (the exchange students) 
said it was disturbing to have the consul there," she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A Chinese student at Columbia University, who helped coordinate the massive 
Manhattan rally on Friday, said that during the march, other protesters warned 
him that there were Chinese people with a videotape camera. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me those were people with the consulate," said the student, who 
declined to give his name. He said students at Columbia believe that Chinese 
intelligence officials also have been reviewing newspaper photographs and local 
and national television coverage of the New York rally in an effort to identify 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the fear is the widespread rumor that over the years the Chinese 
Communist government has been able to plant informers among exchange students. 
At Stony Brook, Morris said it was unclear whether the consulate official 
showed up on his own or had been invited by student sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
At Harvard, Prof. Ezra F. Vogel, a China specialist, said that some Chinese 
students are viewed with suspicion by others. "There is distrust and fear," he 
said, "a feeling that there are people (here) who are presumed to convey 
responses (back to China) and are in a position to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Wang Shaohua, a spokesman for the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, denied 
any attempts to intimidate students in the United States. He said the consulate 
has taken no pictures and is compiling no blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
"This is entirely unfounded and a fabrication," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
But student leaders throughout the country said they recognize their 
government's methods of intimidation since most of them were teen-agers during 
the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when many intellectuals were jailed, tortured 
or executed. 
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese students say they will continue to protest the massacre in 
Beijing. But among many willing to risk exposure, there is a recognition that 
their actions may haunt them for years. 
</P>
<P>
Qi, the student leader at Berkeley, said that students who have participated in 
demonstrations in the Bay Area are certain that they have been filmed by 
consular officials on the roof or from windows. At first, he said, the students 
paid little attention, even when officials they recognized walked with cameras 
into the crowd of protesters. 
</P>
<P>
But since the June 4 massacre in Tian An Men Square and the arrest of hundreds 
of student leaders in China, the photographing has been seen as an ominous 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, they know our names," Qi said. "There is no way I would return to 
China now." 
</P>
<P>
Wang Haitao, an editor of the recently created Freedom Press Herald in 
Alhambra, said the newspaper has received two threatening phone calls -- one to 
the newspaper's office and another to an editor's home. He said one anonymous 
caller simply said, "Be careful, your future is not good." 
</P>
<P>
In Canada, a group of Chinese students who gathered at a Chinese Baptist church 
in Toronto said they fear arrest upon their return home. Jim Karygiannis, a 
Liberal opposition member of Parliament who organized the session, said some 
students have told him that their families in China have been placed under 
"house detention" because of pictures and news sent from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's minister of external affairs, Joe Clark, announced last week that the 
4,000 Chinese students in Canada will be allowed to stay on until the situation 
in China is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 Chinese students are in the United States on temporary educational 
visas that President Bush extended for one year in light of the turmoil in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Xu Xiannian, a leader of the Chinese students at UC Davis, said that regardless 
of the consequences, he and others believe that the risks are worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of people have been killed at Tian An Men," Xu said. "When I 
eventually return to China, people would ask me, 'What did you do?' How could I 
possibly answer?" 
</P>
<P>
Goldman reported from New York and Dunn from Los Angeles. Elizabeth Lu in Los 
Angeles, Valarie Basheda in San Francisco and Charles Hirshberg in New York 
also contributed to this story.

SIGNS OF FERVOR NEARLY ERASED FROM BEIJING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most signs that there once was boiling political fervor on the streets of 
Beijing have been all but erased. The city is like an air-brushed photograph in 
which key images have been eliminated. One begins to wonder if they ever 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
No one appears to dare to put up posters denouncing the June 4 military assault 
on Tian An Men Square and its peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators. Once, 
hastily posted messages and photocopied photos competed for attention with the 
government's martial-law orders. Now the denunciations have disappeared. So 
have any pro-democracy posters. 
</P>
<P>
All the burnt-out armored cars and buses have been removed from streets and 
intersections where they were left by outraged Beijing citizens retaliating 
against the army's crackdown. Thoroughfares have been swept by legions of 
soldiers and municipal workers. 
</P>
<P>
The government boasts that this city of 10 million is back to normal and in a 
way it is: normal for the early 1980s, or perhaps before 1979, when the last 
prolonged drive for democracy blossomed and then withered in Beijing and other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
In a 10-day period, once-vibrant, open discussion has receded from the lips of 
many Beijing residents, replaced by evasion and suspicion. The atmosphere has 
reverted to those earlier, gloomier times. 
</P>
<P>
Before June 4, political questions stimulated uncommonly passionate speeches 
about government corruption, ineffectiveness and the need for democracy. Now, 
the favored response is, "It's not clear." 
</P>
<P>
One longtime Western resident of the city driving past the Beijing Hotel spied 
a long, red banner with the words, "Long Live the Great, Glorious and Correct 
Communist Party." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slogans Like Museum Pieces 
</P>
<P>
"These are like pieces out of a museum. I don't think anyone thought these 
kinds of things would come back," he said of the banners. 
</P>
<P>
A veil is being pulled across the events that rocked the city. To seek accounts 
of the civilian dead or missing is to run into virtual silence. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday at Babaoshan, the city's main cemetery and crematory, reporters 
sought information on the numbers of victims whose bodies might have been 
brought there after the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
A civilian standing guard at the gate of the cemetery's crematory grounds said 
there was no registry of arrivals. Told that a caretaker at the front entrance 
had assured visitors that such a registry was available, the guard said that 
foreigners could have access to only the registry of foreign deaths and that in 
any case, one would need government approval to get a look at that or anything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shrine to Dead Soldier 
</P>
<P>
While virtually no trace of the civilian dead from the army invasion of the 
city can be found, the site of a place where a soldier was killed became an 
official shrine Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a pedestrian overpass at Chongwenmen, near the train station, 
government-affiliated groups, including the Beijing Women's Federation, marched 
to hang wreaths from the bridge where the soldier was burned and hanged by a 
mob. 
</P>
<P>
Schoolchildren waved paper flowers while adults bowed three times before the 
spot where the soldier had died. State television recorded the scene for 
broadcast throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Before the crackdown on pro-democracy students and their supporters, and for a 
day or two after, political talk on the street was angry, defiant and 
unrestrained. Now, there is fear of talking out of doors or in groups. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Beijing residents occasionally find ways to overcome their fears. Mobile 
conversations sometimes take place in a crowd of cyclists when one rider pulls 
up alongside another and begins to talk, without ever looking to the side. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation sometimes turns to desperate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it hard to get a visa to the United States?" asked one such mobile talker. 
"There is no hope for China." 
</P>
<P>
At a snack shop, a request to light a cigarette might be a pretext to exchange 
a few words, at least until someone else enters the room. 
</P>
<P>
No one has to tell the Chinese directly not to talk. There are plenty of 
indirect ways to break up talk about the events of Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plainclothesmen Interrupt 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, conversations on the street are interrupted out of the blue by 
someone in plainclothes who butts in and makes an insulting remark. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an internal matter. This is not a foreigner's business," interjected 
one such stranger during a conversation near the Beijing Hotel on Changan 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The small crowd that had gathered to listen to a discussion of a shooting that 
occurred last week slowly broke up, with everyone going in different 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters visiting Beijing University the other day found that their parked car 
had, in their absence, been surrounded by a group of plainclothesmen of 
ambiguous intent. 
</P>
<P>
As the driver and passenger entered the car, they were jostled briefly by the 
men, who then kicked the side of one door as the foreigners left. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protesters Now Phantoms 
</P>
<P>
On the campuses of universities, it is almost as if the students who protested 
-- and the ones who died -- were phantoms. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the mother of one dead student, Xiao Zhi, went to the People's 
University campus to collect her son's books and belongings, his dormitory 
mates said. 
</P>
<P>
The students told a reporter that Xiao, 20, who had been a hunger-striker at 
Tian An Men Square, had escaped the crackdown of June 4. But he returned to the 
vicinity of the square the next day after buying a train ticket for his home in 
Sichuan province. 
</P>
<P>
During an army thrust down Nanchizi street near the Forbidden City, Xiao "froze 
for a moment, turned to look at the solders and was shot in the chest," one of 
the students said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cremated at Cemetery 
</P>
<P>
Xiao was a communications student at the university who had hoped to become a 
television news announcer. He was cremated earlier this week at Babaoshan 
Cemetery, the students said. 
</P>
<P>
The cramped room that he shared with seven other students contained the usual 
clutter of Chinese university students: books, electric fans, laundry strung 
from bed to bed. 
</P>
<P>
With Xiao's things now removed, one of his roommates had placed some cartons on 
his now bare bed; amid the mess hardly anyone could tell that someone else had 
once occupied that space.

DID COCAINE STING FUEL DRUG SALES?

<P>
One step ahead of the police, White Art wheeled his El Camino off the road and 
vanished into the yawning maw of his warehouse. The door automatically lowered 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
From inside, he watched the police car pull into the driveway, right up to the 
edge of his domain, and stop as the warehouse door slid shut. Before long, the 
driveway was full of police cars. 
</P>
<P>
The man known as White Art, alias James Lewis, alias Arthur Brooks, alias 
Phillip Starr, alias Winston Tajeda, was Cleveland's biggest drug dealer, an 
imposing, bearded, hip-talking white man who walked the city's black East Side 
as if he were king. 
</P>
<P>
The El Camino he was driving that night had a secret compartment underneath 
that was loaded with cocaine, a fresh 13-kilo shipment from Miami. As he paced 
the cement floor inside his warehouse like a caged bear, White Art feared that 
his drug peddling days were about to end. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't have to worry, at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undercover Operation 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not know it then, White Art and the Cleveland Police Department 
were about to embark on a high-risk adventure that would rival the plots of the 
most far-fetched TV cop shows. The story would include double crosses, a near 
murder and some courageous police undercover work that would result in the 
biggest cocaine bust in Ohio history. 
</P>
<P>
But the case also would bring allegations that the police had been so anxious 
to make headlines that they helped pour half a million dollars worth of cocaine 
into the black community and then allowed the money to vanish into the Miami 
drug pipeline. Later, a county prosecutor would accuse the city's top narcotics 
officers of being smitten with "fantasies of 'Miami Vice.' " If so, they were 
fantasies that would plunge the department into a controversy the likes of 
which the city had never seen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confronted by Police 
</P>
<P>
But this all was in the future. Right now, in the wee hours of April 13, 1985, 
the only thing that concerned White Art was the police outside. Officers were 
pounding on the door, shouting for him to open up. But, alone inside with his 
dope, he refused to let them in. 
</P>
<P>
To his delight, the police eventually gave up. They had no search warrant and, 
besides, they had no idea they had cornered a drug dealer -- they thought White 
Art was a car thief. 
</P>
<P>
When the sun came up he saw that the coast was clear, and then he hurriedly 
left, too, leaving the cocaine behind. He was sure the police would be back to 
find it as soon as they got a warrant. He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he would wish he'd never returned, either. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 Cleveland, like other big cities, was fighting an escalating drug war 
on inner-city streets. Cocaine was becoming an ever bigger problem as the 
potent cocaine derivative known as crack began to spread from the two coasts 
into the nation's heartland. The Cleveland police narcotics unit -- especially 
the prestigious major-case squad nicknamed the "A-Team" -- was under heavy 
pressure to make high visibility drug busts. 
</P>
<P>
Like a gift from heaven, on April 19, 1985, White Art was dropped into their 
laps. One of his neighbors had found him badly beaten and left for dead in the 
very warehouse where the police had cornered him six days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
He had a fractured skull, internal injuries and both legs had been badly 
damaged, beaten with a blunt instrument. He also had been given a "hot shot," 
an injection of cocaine and heroin that had been intended to kill him. Someone 
had jumped him from behind. Nobody knew for sure who had done it. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine-laden El Camino was gone, but the police who examined the warehouse 
knew they had a drug dealer on their hands from the cocaine residue, scales and 
other packaging equipment they found. A search of his various properties, 
including a spacious suburban home, turned up a machine gun and a pistol, both 
equipped with silencers, and about $70,000 in cash. Eventually, the police even 
came to learn White Art's true name -- Arthur Feckner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A-Team Plans Sting 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was released from the hospital a month later, still barely able 
to walk, Feckner had been persuaded to aid the A-Team in an elaborate 
stair-step sting operation that the police hoped would lead all the way to 
Colombia, via Miami. In return, the police promised him leniency. 
</P>
<P>
It was an ambitious scheme, by far the most ambitious the squad had ever 
attempted. And it was timed to win maximum national attention for Police Chief 
Thomas Hanton and his likely successor, Lt. Howard E. Rudolph, the head of the 
narcotics unit. A national Drug Enforcement Administration convention was 
coming up. If the A-Team could arrange a 50-kilo bust before then, Hanton and 
Rudolph would be able to attend as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one hitch. 
</P>
<P>
Feckner still owed his Miami drug connection $560,000. He later testified in 
court that he told Sgt. James Bistricky, the 18-year police veteran who headed 
the A-Team, that he would have to settle this debt before he could arrange 
another deal. According to Feckner, the only way he could do that was by 
selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Later the police would contend they thought Feckner got the cash by collecting 
on past debts. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, from mid-June to late July of 1985, while he was in close 
cooperation with the A-Team, Feckner operated a drug "safe house" on the city's 
far East Side, across the street from a sprawling housing project. He sometimes 
brought in as much as $60,000 a day, selling mostly to mid-level dealers who 
then resold the merchandise on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
It was sometime in June that he started turning over to the A-Team brown paper 
bags filled with cash. The police would give him a receipt, and then store the 
cash in a safe in Chief Hanton's office until it was time to launch the sting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Worried About Safety 
</P>
<P>
Feckner had begun meeting with his old drug-dealing partner, Leonard Brooks, 
immediately after getting out of the hospital. The police knew about the 
meetings. In fact, they were concerned for Feckner's safety because they 
thought it was Brooks who had tried to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Detective James Lynsky, one of the A-Team members, gave Feckner a bulletproof 
vest, but he couldn't put it on because his left arm was still paralyzed from 
the beating. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't terribly afraid, though. He didn't think Brooks would try anything in 
broad daylight. But to be on the safe side, he made sure his driver, an 
employee in his drug business, carried a pistol to the meetings, which took 
place in fast-food restaurant parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
At their third meeting, Feckner wore a wire. It is clear from the tape 
transcripts that the two men were discussing selling drugs, but the police 
contend that Feckner was doing it on their instructions, in order to get Brooks 
to incriminate himself. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, the police made 46 tapes of conversations between 
Feckner and other people. Officers who did an internal police investigation of 
the operation later reported that it should have been obvious to anyone 
listening to the tapes that the money piling up in Chief Hanton's safe came not 
from Feckner's old debts but from fresh drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
The A-team detectives told investigators that they hadn't bothered to listen to 
all of the tapes. On one, Detective Lynsky can be heard asking Feckner whether 
he and Brooks had enough "merchandise" to raise the money needed for the sting. 
Despite the taped dialogue, Lynsky and the other officers continued to insist 
that no one knew what Feckner was up to. 
</P>
<P>
Before making his deal with the police, Feckner's routine was to cut and 
package cocaine nightly in the warehouse. The red brick building was hunkered 
down far off the road in one of Cleveland's worst neighborhoods, a 
drug-infested area of working-class homes, junkyards and decay on the edge of 
an industrial zone. A former stamping factory, the building had once housed a 
home improvement business Feckner had owned. Some of Feckner's old home 
improvement employees still worked for him, but most of the renovating they did 
was on Feckner's own safe houses. 
</P>
<P>
Feckner and Brooks had a drug house open somewhere on the East Side seven days 
a week, 12 hours a day. The sales clerks, all women, were paid $500 weekly for 
three or four days of work. They would record each sale on a work sheet, seal 
the money in an envelope and place it in a drop safe to which only Feckner and 
Brooks had the combination. One of the two men would come by after closing time 
at 1 a.m. every night to pick up the money and sales records. 
</P>
<P>
Feckner and Brooks, astute business men, never personally sold drugs. Nor did 
Feckner frequent the safe houses during the hours of operation. His working day 
began after the sun went down and ended in time for him to see his kids off to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning, after spending all night packaging the drugs, Feckner would drop 
the merchandise off at one of three well-fortified houses he owned. A trusted 
employee would pick up the prepackaged cocaine -- each package worth from $140 
to $2,800 -- and take it to the house that would be used for sales that day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved Operation Daily 
</P>
<P>
Feckner and Brooks operated out of several houses, moving the operation daily 
from house to house so that the frequent comings and goings wouldn't attract 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
But when they went back into business in June, Feckner said he told his 
employees they had nothing to fear -- the police were protecting them. They 
could make all of their sales from one house. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the sting took place in Miami on Aug. 27, 1985, Feckner had already 
paid his Miami connection, Jose Munoz, the $560,000 he owed. Munoz made two 
trips to Cleveland to get the money. Also by this time, two of Munoz's 
relatives had been arrested in Cleveland while ferrying drugs to Feckner. 
Thirty-six kilos of cocaine had been confiscated. Now it was time for the big 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the A-Team originally aimed much higher than Munoz. They had wanted 
to go to Colombia, straight to the source of the drugs Feckner was selling, but 
jurisdictional friction with the DEA squashed that idea. But at least they 
would get Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
When they got to Miami, however, things started to go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The police had gotten a $2 million "flash roll" from the DEA. All in $100 
bills, the money was placed in a large suitcase and stashed in the trunk of a 
rented Lincoln Continental. Bistricky, posing as a drug dealer, was supposed to 
drive the car to a shopping center parking lot for the meeting with Munoz. 
Bistricky would show him the money. When the dealer produced the cocaine, the 
police would nab him. That's how it was supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
But then Feckner, after meeting alone with Munoz that morning, notified 
Bistricky that things had changed. Munoz had already shown Feckner the cocaine 
and now wanted Bistricky to bring the money to his home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew Money Was Nearby 
</P>
<P>
That was dangerous. DEA agent Frank Magoch, who had flown down for the bust, 
tried to talk Bistricky out of going inside alone. "I didn't know if they were 
going to hold him hostage or not," Magoch recalled later. "They knew the $2 
million was in the area, possibly in the car." 
</P>
<P>
At first Bistricky, heeding Magoch's advice, stayed behind the wheel of the 
Lincoln while Feckner went in. Magoch hid on the floor of the back seat. But 
Munoz came close to spotting the agent when he came outside unexpectedly and 
started toward the Lincoln. Quickly, Bistricky got out and went to meet the 
drug dealer, going alone with him back into the house, where he saw three 
Colombians armed with automatic weapons were holding the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
After about five minutes, the police officer came back out. He signaled to the 
Miami police officers and DEA agents who secretly had surrounded the house, and 
they swooped down upon the dealers. 
</P>
<P>
From the police department's viewpoint, the unorthodox sting operation was a 
howling success. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 15 people were arrested. Six of them actually were convicted and 46 
kilos of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $50 million, were 
recovered. Feckner, who pleaded guilty to federal and state charges of selling 
13 pounds of cocaine while he was working with the police, is serving a 
five-year sentence in a federal prison. Munoz is serving a 15-year sentence in 
a Florida state prison. Brooks is serving a seven-year sentence in a state 
prison on two counts of supplying money to obtain drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Mayor George V. Voinovich at first praised the police sting as 
"innovative" police work in 1985. Appearing with Bistricky and Rudolph at a 
press conference to announce the bust, he posed for pictures in front of the 
piles of money and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when news of the department's alleged arrangement with Feckner 
began leaking out in 1986, there was an immediate uproar from the NAACP and 
others in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
"No decision like this could've been made to have this type of operation on the 
West Side of Cleveland or anywhere that's predominantly white," said U.S. Rep. 
Louis Stokes, who has pressed for full disclosure about the operation for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do that on their own," he said of the five officers. "Somebody 
gave approval. Somebody above those five officers made a conscious decision 
that this is a throwaway community." 
</P>
<P>
The operation, one of the most investigated police actions anyone can recall in 
Cleveland, has been probed five times at various levels, the first time in an 
internal police review that a subsequent department investigation dismissed as 
a sham. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, investigations were performed by members of the police Professional 
Conduct and Internal Review unit and investigators from the sheriff's 
department. The investigative reports, which led to indictments of the five 
members of the A-Team, supported Feckner's allegations that the officers 
allowed "and, in essence, participated" in illegal street sales. 
</P>
<P>
At the subsequent trial, attorneys for the five A-Team members tried to paint 
the officers as inexperienced and out of their league, contending that Feckner, 
the wily con man, had taken advantage of them. It was "a classic example of the 
hunter being captured by the game," is how Clarence D. Rogers, Bistricky's 
attorney, put it. 
</P>
<P>
Hanton, the former chief, said during the trial, "I think Mr. Feckner scammed 
the police department." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Figler, a detective from the police Professional Conduct and Internal 
Review unit who investigated the sting operation, said Lynsky, one of the 
A-Team members, told investigators: "From day one, we were flying from the seat 
of our pants." 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Jack Hudson portrayed the police 
officers at the trial as being more concerned with making a splash than with 
keeping drugs off the street. He made much of the fact that the sale of 31 
ounces of cocaine is enough to earn a dealer the maximum sentence. For the 
police to press Feckner to make a 50-kilo buy, he suggested throughout the 
trial, was gross overkill. 
</P>
<P>
Also, two former narcotics detectives testified that Bistricky had told them to 
keep their men away from the area where the drug sales were going on, 
indicating that he knew they were taking place. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Michael J. Corrigan ruled mid-trial, after presentation of the 
prosecution's case, that, even if the officers knowingly conspired with Feckner 
to sell drugs, the sales would be legal under Ohio law if they were done for a 
law enforcement purpose. The officers were acquitted in December of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict brought howls from some members of the black community, who said it 
gave the police permission to sell drugs with impunity. The verdict by law 
cannot be overturned, but citing alleged errors in Corrigan's reasoning, the 
prosecutor is appealing to the Ohio Supreme Court. Also, U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh has agreed to open a Justice Department review of the case, which 
will be the sixth inquiry into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and lawyers for the five officers, contending that Feckner would 
have been stopped had the police known he was selling drugs, say the police 
department's biggest mistake was failing to keep closer tabs on him. 
</P>
<P>
After publishing excerpts from the damning investigative reports, the Cleveland 
Plain Dealer in April called for the dismissal of Rudolph, who now is the 
police chief, saying he must have known about the drug sales when he was in 
charge of the narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph acknowledged in a letter to Voinovich in early 1987 that he and his men 
had made mistakes. "However, these mistakes can be attributed to errors in 
judgment or poor record keeping," he wrote. "They were certainly not the result 
of police misconduct or violation of law." 
</P>
<P>
Safety Director Mitchell J. Brown said steps have been taken to institute 
controls in the department to make sure that what happened cannot reoccur. 
Still, he said the A-Team broke no departmental rules, mainly because no rules 
had been established prohibiting such acts as using a drug dealer's money in a 
police operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$500,000 in Drug Sales 
</P>
<P>
But no one now disputes the fact that Feckner, while under police supervision, 
collected $500,000 from narcotics sales and passed it on to his Miami drug 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Lt. Russell Kubik of the Metro-Dade Police Narcotics Bureau said the 
most money he can recall being lost in a police operation there was "$1,000 to 
$1,200, and that was like 15, 18 years ago. . . .The chances of losing a half 
million dollars are just infinitesimal, almost non-existent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown said the Cleveland police had no obligation to keep the half million 
dollars from disappearing into the drug underworld because "that was somebody 
else's money. They can do whatever they want with their money." 
</P>
<P>
Then he grew angry with black leaders who attacked the police department for 
allowing Feckner to sell drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, this man was selling drugs since 1972 to the best of our 
knowledge, and the black community never turned his ass in," said Brown, who is 
black and was appointed after the controversy broke. "We didn't have any great 
support from the black community in getting (him) arrested. Who the hell was 
buying the drugs? . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I get very angry when people come to me with indignation about the guy selling 
drugs when the guy couldn't sell drugs in the black community if they didn't 
want him there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We did what we had to do to get rid of this guy permanently," he said of 
Feckner. "We care about this community. We care about the entire city." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Bort, the president of the Cleveland Police Patrolman's Assn. and a 
vigorous defender of the five A-Team members, accused Stokes of pressing the 
issue mainly because his brother, former Mayor Carl Stokes, is contemplating 
running for mayor again. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's damn the cops even though the cops didn't do anything wrong," 
he said. "Election year is damn the cop year. And we know we're going to get 
our butts kicked every election year." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from possible ramifications for the local mayor's race, the case also 
promises to have repercussions in next year's gubernatorial election. Voinovich 
is a candidate. Already, the head of the state Democratic Party is promising to 
make Arthur Feckner into Voinovich's Willie Horton, referring to the rapist 
George Bush's campaign used to attack Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in the 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
"It should've been done better," William Howell, the mayor's executive 
secretary, said of the sting operation. "But this was a first-time process. The 
major goal at that time was to nail this sucker and the people with him. 
</P>
<P>
"We took down the major drug dealer in the city and his cohorts, all the way 
down the line," he continued. "They're all in jail. They have been tried and 
convicted . . . (The sting) was successful from a judicial viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
"We can do a lot of ifs," said Hanton last December from the stand at the trial 
of the five police officers. "If we had known this (drug sales) was going to 
occur, it would not have occurred."

SCHOOL AID PACT BREAKS ASSEMBLY BUDGET STALEMATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic and Republican negotiators in the Assembly reached agreement Tuesday 
on a $1.5-billion school aid package designed to help suburban and rural 
districts and end a stalemate that had halted work on a proposed state budget. 
</P>
<P>
The full Assembly responded hours later by passing its $49.5-billion version of 
the budget. The vote was 54-13, the exact two-thirds majority required. The 
Senate will vote today, moving the budget debate into a two-house conference 
committee, which then will write a final legislative version to send to Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly negotiations centered on legislation to implement Proposition 98, an 
initiative approved by voters in November. The settlement -- which still must 
be endorsed by the Senate -- called for setting aside $441 million of a 
potential $2.5-billion budget surplus to finance special financial aid programs 
that Republicans contend have been shortchanged by Democrats in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, one new program would be added to more than 50 special 
categorical school aid programs that already exist. It would create a new 
$200-million-a-year special financial aid program for districts -- mainly 
suburban and rural -- that traditionally have been left out when urban 
Democrats divide up the school funding pie. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Glendale Unified School District would receive $2.3 million 
under the special new program while Los Angeles Unified -- with roughly 26 
times the enrollment -- would get nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also called for so-called "have-not" school districts to receive 
another $141 million to balance state expenditures distributed for special 
categorical programs. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Assembly Republicans agreed in principle to support a proposed 
constitutional amendment that would repeal key provisions of the voter-approved 
limit on government spending that has kept a tight lid on state appropriations 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), the lead Republican negotiator, argued in 
the floor debate that the compromise was "historic" because it represented an 
effort to finance school districts equally throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Some Los Angeles Democrats objected, claiming that legislators from the rest of 
the state were ganging up on the city's schools. "I think Los Angeles city 
schools are getting raped," declared Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana). 
</P>
<P>
But a Central Valley Democrat, Assemblyman Patrick Johnston of Stockton, 
speaking for many of his rural colleagues, told reporters: "Los Angeles has 
'pigged out' so much over the years that this proposal only just begins to even 
things up." And Democratic Assemblyman Sam Farr of Carmel complained about Los 
Angeles lobbyists. "They are like a small army," he said. "It's an incredible 
political force." 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong battle over school funding virtually guaranteed that the 
Legislature again would miss the June 15 deadline in the California 
Constitution for passage of the budget. This would be the third straight year 
the Legislature has missed its due-date for the budget. The deadline has often 
been criticized as toothless because legislators face no penalties for being 
late. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans began the deadlock last week by refusing to vote on the Assembly 
floor for a Ways and Means Committee draft of a $49.5-billion budget until 
Democrats agreed to steer more school aid to GOP-represented rural and suburban 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
At stake was a share of the windfall in tax revenue that developed last month 
when Deukmejian updated his estimates of receipts and expenditures for the 
current and upcoming fiscal years. Deukmejian said that largely because of 
higher-than-expected income tax receipts, the state will have $1.1 billion more 
to spend this fiscal year and $1.4 billion more in the next budget year, which 
begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed compromise worked out by Assembly negotiators would earmark $557 
million for public schools and community colleges in the current year and $952 
million next year. 
</P>
<P>
In the current budget year, $136 million would be set aside to meet 
unanticipated general education expenses, $50 million would go to community 
colleges, $50 million for instruction materials, $70 million would be earmarked 
for school maintenance and $251 million would be disbursed evenly among 
districts on a per-pupil basis. 
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year that begins July 1, school districts would receive the $441 
million for special categorical programs, $270 million to finance a 4.6% 
across-the-board increase, with the remainder being allocated to community 
colleges and other education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the plan were being circulated among Senate lawmakers. "We have to 
get the Senate to agree to this, too," Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said he agrees generally with the 
overall structure of the financial plan, but differed on some key details. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest point of disagreement appears to be the proposal to spend $200 
million on the special categorical program for "have-not" school districts. 
Honig noted that the money to finance the plan would come from funds he would 
like to see used to reduce classroom overcrowding and various school 
improvement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said he would prefer that the districts receive $50 million each year for 
four years, up to a total of $200 million. That would free up $150 million 
during the upcoming budget year for class-size reduction and school improvement 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Honig said the general framework for the compromise was sound and 
added that he believes the differences are not insurmountable.

PROBE OF ANY DOE DRUG EXPERIMENTS SET

<P>
Sen. John Glenn plans to question Department of Energy officials as early as 
next week about whether they used experimental drugs on workers at the Rocky 
Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant, an aide to the Ohio Democrat said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI and Environmental Protection Agency, investigating illegal dumping of 
toxics at the Energy Department-owned facility, revealed in an affidavit last 
week that chemicals associated with medical experiments were found in trace 
amounts in a stream that flows from Rocky Flats. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington and Colorado, authorities were trying Tuesday to determine what 
chemicals may have been used, what their health effects might be, and whether 
or not they may have been used on Rocky Flats workers with or without their 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"We are requesting that the DOE come in and explain to us the full extent of 
the research involving humans at its nuclear weapons facilities," said the aide 
to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the facility near Denver would not comment in any detail. But Dr. 
Joseph Furman, Rocky Flats' medical director, said: "I'll tell you one thing, 
we don't use any experimental drugs on anybody out here." 
</P>
<P>
The drug found in trace amounts in a creek near Rocky Flats has been used in 
experiments to determine whether it can protect humans from the effects of 
radiation. The military long has sought such a chemical to protect troops from 
nuclear fallout. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the chemicals, 1,3-dihydro-2H-idol-2-one, has been experimentally 
tested concerning its ability to protect against radiation-induced cellular 
damage," the FBI and EPA said in the affidavit requesting court authorization 
to search the 6,500-acre plant. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical, identified in the 1800s, occurs naturally in low levels in the 
human body, and can act as a depressant. Experiments with its potential use as 
protection against radiation are relatively recent, said Niels Schonbeck, 
chemistry professor at Metropolitan State College in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The DOE facility, operated by Rockwell International Corp., makes plutonium 
triggers for nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Energy officials were unaware of any request to appear before 
Glenn's committee, said spokeswoman Chris Sankey. Sankey said the agency had no 
comment Tuesday on whether medical experiments had been conducted at Rocky 
Flats. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Tuesday by Rockwell's chairman at company headquarters in El 
Segundo did not address the specific allegations against Rocky Flats, which 
include possible cover-up of illegal dumping, incineration and storage of toxic 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
"In our judgment, the plant has been run safely and in compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations," said Donald R. Beall, who heads the 
$12-billion company.

At an international conference seeking new procedures for screening and 
resettling Vietnamese "boat people," the United States on Tuesday strongly 
opposed proposals for the mandatory return of refugees determined to have fled 
Vietnam for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Until dramatic improvements occur in that country's economic, social and 
political life," U.S. envoy Lawrence S. Eagleburger told delegates from 50 
countries at the U.N.-sponsored conference, "the United States will remain 
unalterably opposed to the forced repatriation of Vietnamese asylum-seekers." 
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the United States found an unusual ally in the Communist 
government of Vietnam itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support the principal of free choice of residence and of voluntary 
repatriation," said Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, who is also vice 
president of the Council of Ministers in Vietnam. "That's why we resolutely 
reject all forms of coercion." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position is also supported by the U.N. refugee commissioner and by 
France, which has a history of humanitarian work with the boat people. 
</P>
<P>
However, the majority of the Asian countries directly affected by a recent 
dramatic increase in Vietnamese refugees arriving on their shores, as well as 
Britain and Australia, support a rigorous screening process and the mandatory 
return of Vietnamese who cannot prove political persecution in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"We in Thailand will not be able to bear the brunt of the problem much longer 
if there is not a new approach," said Thai Minister of Foreign Affairs Siddhi 
Savetsila. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam must accept that no country has the right to export its surplus 
population to other countries," said British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, 
in a speech that reflected the tough mood of many of the delegates. 
</P>
<P>
The International Conference on Indochinese Refugees was prompted by the 
dramatic increase in the number of Vietnamese fleeing their country. As of May 
31, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees reported 83,296 Vietnamese boat 
people in refugee camps, the highest number since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
From a high point of 202,121 refugees in 1979, the flow of refugees steadily 
declined until it reached a low of 19,527 in 1986. Since then, however, the 
number has increased again, greatly alarming the countries of "first asylum" 
surrounding Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different From Predecessors 
</P>
<P>
Many countries, including British-administered Hong Kong, claim that the new 
wave of refugees are radically different from their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
"The great majority of those now arriving in Hong Kong," said Howe, "are 
economic migrants -- farmers, fishermen and peasants from the north with no 
association with the former South Vietnamese regime." 
</P>
<P>
At the last U.N. conference on Indochinese refugees in July, 1979, also in 
Geneva, the mood of most of the nations was more sympathetic to the Vietnamese 
plight. For the most part, asylum, refuge and resettlement was considered a 
right for the Vietnamese after their involvement in a long civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the continuing presence of large numbers of Vietnamese 
refugees has caused political friction in the host countries as well as some of 
the settlement countries such as Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"The resettlement strategy adopted 10 years ago, which was designed to provide 
a generous and humanitarian response to genuine refugees, is no longer a 
complete solution," commented Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade 
Gareth Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, it has in a sense become part of the problem. The belief in the 
ultimate inevitability of resettlement has become the cause of departure of 
those who are not refugees but whose motivation for leaving is clearly economic 
-- who are chasing a dream of a better life elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, more than 1 million Vietnamese have 
left Vietnam, many braving open seas, pirates and gunboats as they made their 
way to refugee camps mainly in Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines 
and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
More than 714,000 Indochinese refugees eventually immigrated into the United 
States, making it by far the largest recipient country, followed by China 
(284,000), Canada (121,182), Australia (117,997) and France (108,241). 
</P>
<P>
Today, the United States is expected to join the other countries attending the 
conference in approving a new plan to process Vietnamese and Laotian refugees 
in camps. The plan calls for a screening process under the auspices of the U.N. 
refugee commissioner, an expansion of a resettlement program for applicants 
inside Vietnam and acceleration of a "voluntary repatriation" program for those 
refugees who do not qualify for political refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are hoping the voluntary repatriation plan will eliminate the 
need for deportation and forced repatriation schemes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are practically the only country left fighting for a humanitarian way," 
said one frustrated official.

Argentina's president-elect, Carlos Saul Menem, said Tuesday that he will take 
office June 30, the date that Raul Alfonsin intends to resign because of that 
nation's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, there were indications that Menem might not step into the office five 
months early, as Alfonsin proposed. But on Tuesday, Menem told a news 
conference in La Rioja province, of which he is governor, that "we are willing, 
totally willing, to assume the direction of the Argentine republic on that 
date." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Alfonsin had said in a nationally broadcast speech that he 
lacks the political support to manage the crisis and that he will leave office 
at the end of the month. Shortly afterward, Menem called the statement 
"surprising," and an aide said June 30 was too soon for him to take office. 
</P>
<P>
Menem's statement Tuesday appeared to resolve an impasse that began when his 
Peronist party defeated Alfonsin's Radical Civic Union in national elections 
May 14, seven months before the Dec. 10 inauguration date stipulated in the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The Peronists and Radical Civic Union tried for weeks to reach an accord on an 
early transition, against a backdrop of inflation that nearly doubled prices 
every month, a growing budget deficit, a nearly worthless currency, record 
interest rates and rising unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed and dozens seriously injured in food riots and 
looting that began the last week of May.

Japan, breaking out of its cautious stance over unrest in China, said Tuesday 
that the Beijing government should be "fully cognizant of the international 
implications" of the army crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Kazutoshi Hasegawa, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs 
Bureau, told Parliament, "We haven't determined the exact death toll, but 
according to a Chinese Red Cross source, as a result of the Chinese government 
action on June 4, about 2,600 people died." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact was that many people were killed and those killings were verified by 
the staff members of the (Japanese) Embassy," said chief Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Tazio Watanabe. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the Chinese government will be fully cognizant of the 
international implications of the developments . . . and of its own status in 
international society," Watanabe told foreign correspondents.

U.S. TO SPEED UP VISAS FOR CHINESE WHO WANT TO FLEE

<P>
The Bush Administration pledged Tuesday to assign additional diplomats to 
process visas and do "whatever it takes" to help Chinese citizens trying to 
flee their strife-torn country for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Administration promised only to give a yes or no answer promptly 
to visa requests, a State Department official said that, in practice, a high 
percentage of the requests probably will be granted to allow Chinese to escape 
the government crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, pressure was building on Capitol Hill to impose additional 
economic sanctions on China in response to the regime's sweeping arrests of 
democracy demonstrators. The chairmen of the Asia subcommittees in the Senate 
and House, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), 
issued separate calls for further action against the Beijing government. 
</P>
<P>
"I would favor immediately dropping the People's Republic of China from the 
list of countries getting most-favored-nation trade treatment, and I would 
consider other steps in the future," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
Solarz visited the State Department to urge additional sanctions. A spokesman 
said Solarz argued "that because of events in Beijing since the initial 
crackdown, we need to do more than the President announced last week." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush suspended arms sales to China and halted U.S. military contacts 
with the Chinese army after the June 4 massacre in and around Tian An Men 
Square but he has taken no additional steps in response to the continuing 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said long lines of Chinese 
seeking visas have formed outside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and at consulates 
in other cities. The visa sections in Beijing and Shanghai, the nation's 
largest city, have been closed, but Tutwiler said they will reopen today. She 
said the U.S. consulates in Canton, Shenyang and Chengdu are operating 
normally. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tutwiler said that normal operations may prove to be inadequate in the 
face of the expected demand for temporary permission to come to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be monitoring the requirements to assure that staffing levels are 
adequate to provide the full range of consular services, including visa 
issuances," she said. "If it's above the normal load of visas, whatever it 
takes to process visas" will be done. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are non-immigrant visas, usually granted to students, tourists and 
business people. For Chinese citizens who have passports, the visa is all that 
is needed in order to leave the country. They are approved at the discretion of 
U.S. consular staff members after they state a valid reason for wanting to come 
to this country. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, however, only a relative handful of Chinese citizens hold 
passports. A Chinese citizen can generally obtain a passport only for 
government-approved travel abroad and often has to surrender it on return. 
Thus, the State Department move is unlikely to make a significant difference in 
the number of Chinese able to come to the United States, although it may help 
some students with passports who previously had been denied U.S. visas on the 
grounds that their true intent was to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extended Current Visas 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department last week extended all visas currently in effect because 
of the unsettled situation in China. Officials said it is unlikely that any 
Chinese already in the United States would be sent home until conditions in 
China improve. 
</P>
<P>
"The detention or arrest of people for exercising their basic human rights of 
freedom of expression and free association is contrary to internationally 
recognized standards," Tutwiler said in the Administration's first direct 
reaction to the wave of arrests by the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III received on Tuesday a 
comprehensive list of possible options for new U.S. sanctions. But she said 
that no immediate action is planned. 
</P>
<P>
"This is nothing more than a list of options, should a situation ever 
materialize so that you would be ready, you would not have to spend the hours 
that the people have spent to pull them together and collect all the 
information," Tutwiler said. "This is not something that has been sent to him 
in the form of recommendations. . . . Which options he might or might not 
choose, I don't know. He doesn't know." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Americans Have Left 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, most possible U.S. economic sanctions have already been 
overrun by events. For instance, in recent years the U.S. government attempted 
to put economic pressure on Libya by ordering U.S. business people to leave the 
country. There is not much point in doing that in China because almost all 
American citizens have already fled the country. Similarly, an embargo on new 
U.S. investment in China would seem to be superfluous, at least for the time 
being. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) told a breakfast meeting with a group of 
reporters that "business in China is pretty much dead" so there is very little 
left that would be affected by sanctions. Lugar, a member of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, said the chances of salvaging U.S.-China relations are 
fading rapidly and "it simply may not be possible to restore good relations 
with this particular Chinese government."

Two more diplomats attached to the Chinese Consulate here may be considering 
asking for political asylum because they don't want to inform on Chinese 
students, according to a report in today's editions of the San Francisco 
Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
The pair, a husband and wife who work in the consulate's education section, are 
staying with friends in the Bay Area, despite being due back in Beijing this 
week, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources close to the couple, who were not identified, the paper said 
the diplomats had been expected to inform on Chinese exchange students 
protesting here over the June 4 massacre of demonstrators in Tian An Men 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to provide a blacklist," said a friend of the couple who was 
identified only as a student leader at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
Wang Shaohua, a spokesman for the consulate, denied that the couple might be 
considering defection. He said they left the consulate last week to "live in a 
friend's home" for "some time." He added that their move was "quite a bit 
unusual" because the travel of Communist consular officials in the United 
States is restricted. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Chinese diplomats from the consulate sought FBI protection Saturday 
night after announcing at a City Hall rally that they planned to defect because 
of the Beijing government's propaganda campaign, which claims no students were 
killed in the crackdown on the country's pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Zhou Liming, 26, vice consul for cultural affairs, and Zhang Limin, 25, vice 
consul for overseas affairs, told the FBI that they wanted to seek political 
asylum in the United States. They have since gone into hiding and are 
reportedly reconsidering their actions. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said Tuesday night that the FBI had not been contacted by any other 
diplomats seeking asylum.

The Seabrook nuclear power plant began its first atomic chain reaction Tuesday, 
a pivotal event for a $6-billion project after years of delays, cost overruns 
and protests made it a focal point of the anti-nuclear movement. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook operators started sustained nuclear fission reaction in the plant's 
100 tons of uranium fuel at 5:23 p.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in July, 1986, Seabrook received a federal low-power license on May 
26, a day after a federal appeals court refused to block the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Because of three faulty safety valves, initial atomic operations were delayed 
about a week. Preparations for the first fission reaction were resumed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Plant operators then withdrew control rods from the reactor's fuel core and 
slowly began diluting the boron concentration in the reactor coolant water. 
Boron absorbs neutrons so they cannot strike and split uranium atoms to release 
more neutrons and trigger a chain reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook was planned for commercial operation in 1979. A twin reactor was 
abandoned when it was 25% completed. Both reactors were to have cost less than 
$1 billion to build. 
</P>
<P>
Protests since construction began in 1976 have resulted in more than 3,200 
arrests. During two days of demonstrations earlier this month, 734 people were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Low-power testing must take place before a nuclear power plant may operate 
commercially, but before Seabrook can get a full-power license, it also must 
gain approval of evacuation plans for nearby beaches and communities up to 10 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Six Massachusetts communities are within 10 miles of Seabrook, but that state 
maintains that evacuation of the area would not be feasible. Federal hearings 
on evacuation plans that Seabrook has developed for Massachusetts are under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook's owners also may have to prove they are financially qualified to run 
the plant commercially. The primary owner, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, 
is under federal bankruptcy protection, and some of the 11 other utilities with 
Seabrook shares also have financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled in December that those troubles 
pose no safety problem for low-power tests as long as the owners posted a bond 
to pay to decommission the reactor after the tests should it never operate 
commercially. Owners posted the bond last month.

The National Institutes of Health will develop guidelines defining conflict of 
interest for non-government scientists who receive federal funds for their 
research, the director of the agency told Congress Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James B. Wyngaarden, director of NIH, which awards about $7 billion in 
grants annually, disclosed the plan to a House subcommittee that is 
investigating whether government-sponsored research is being compromised by 
scientists' financial associations with private companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Public Health Service is concerned about maintaining the integrity of 
science," Wyngaarden told the Government Operations Committee's subcommittee on 
human resources and intergovernmental relations. "We believe that protection of 
that integrity must be a joint effort on the part of the government and the 
institutions where research is performed." 
</P>
<P>
He and others said that such partnerships were necessary to the advancement of 
science, but warned that they could also create a climate for conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard it said within the scientific community that everyone gains from 
this marriage of academia and commerce," said Sheldon Krimsky, an associate 
professor in the department of urban and environmental policy at Tufts 
University. "Nothing can be further from the truth. Not only are there losses, 
but some of these losses threaten the integrity of our scientific institutions 
and weaken public confidence in science." 
</P>
<P>
Wyngaarden said that NIH requires its scientists to disclose their financial 
interests to prove they have no monetary association with any company whose 
products they study, but as yet, the agency has no similar rule for 
non-governmental researchers who receive federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Wyngaarden said, NIH and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health 
Administration plan to sponsor a two-day meeting later this month on conflict 
of interest and what the agencies should do about it. 
</P>
<P>
He said the conference will take up issues such as whether a researcher's 
financial interest or arrangement with a company would necessarily influence 
the outcome of the research, and whether scientists should be permitted to 
profit financially from information obtained in the course of their research. 
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that research results are not distorted by financial 
involvements of investigators, but we must also ensure that the progress of 
science is unhindered," Wyngaarden said. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) attacked university programs, 
specifically at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that encourage 
exchanges of research findings with corporations -- including many foreign 
companies. Weiss and others contend that such arrangements can hurt U.S. 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
In MIT's Industrial Liaison Program, firms pay the institute a membership fee 
-- in some cases as much as $50,000 annually -- and are allowed access to MIT 
research publications and other data. 
</P>
<P>
David Noble, a history professor at Drexel University who is suing MIT on the 
grounds that he was dismissed from the institute for publicly condemning 
conflicts of interest, told the subcommittee that all member corporations of 
the Industrial Liaison Program were multinationals "with no necessary 
allegiance to the United States" and that the majority of the foreign 
corporation-members were "major Japanese competitors." 
</P>

MIT President Paul E. Gray defended the program. He said: "The educational and 
research functions of this science-based university require broadly based 
understanding of industrial practice and industrial needs. The ILP is an 
important vehicle for developing that understanding, and this is its principal 
benefit to the institute."

Bill Stacy, the president of Southeast Missouri State University, has been 
named by the trustees of the California State University system to head its 
20th campus -- a new university in San Marcos in northern San Diego County. 
Stacy's appointment surprised and disappointed many people involved in the 
four-month-long search process because he was not the first choice of either 
community leaders, faculty, staff or students. But CSU Chancellor W. Ann 
Reynolds said Stacy, 50, was the first choice of the trustees. Stacy, who will 
be paid between $100,000 and $110,000 in his new post, was asked to report for 
duty by the end of July. The new university will accept its first few hundred 
students in the fall of 1990 in buildings now leased by San Diego State 
University, which now offers upper-division courses in San Marcos. The San 
Marcos campus will be constructed on a 300-acre site, once a chicken ranch, 
with the first academic buildings opening for upper-division students in the 
fall of 1992.

Soldiers heading down a tree-lined path into battle will be a key element of 
the $6-million Korean War veterans' memorial in Washington, according to 
sources familiar with the plan. A one-eighth scale model of the Korean memorial 
is being unveiled today at a White House ceremony. Architects of the project, 
to be built across the Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam War Memorial, also 
contemplate a wall containing inscriptions about the war. Sources described the 
project as a combination of sculpture, architecture and landscape design 
embracing a succession of granite or bronze soldiers intended to collectively 
depict a transition from the anxious but brave entrance into war and combat and 
the return home.

Hungary's Communist Party opened talks with the opposition on moves toward 
multi-party democracy, and party chief Karoly Grosz said the discussions could 
lead to a new ruling coalition. The talks, involving the government and 
representatives of Hungary's nine largest independent parties and groups, are 
expected to last several months. Participants will hammer out ground rules for 
Hungary's first free elections in more than 40 years, due by mid-1990, and 
debate Hungary's economic and social troubles.

The Philippine military has deployed more than 1,000 troops and police in towns 
around a U.S. air base to thwart Communist rebel attacks on American service 
personnel, the state-run Philippine News Agency said. The agency said 
paramilitary commander Maj. Julius Yarcia has ordered intensified patrols in 
rebel-influenced districts in Angeles city, where Clark Air Base is located, 
and nearby towns. It quoted Yarcia as saying he ordered the deployment after 
the military seized rebel documents listing eight American soldiers as possible 
targets for Communist hit-squads operating around Angeles, 50 miles north of 
Manila.

A man who tested positive for AIDS and who said he had sex with at least 14 
women without using condoms before he found out, sued his doctors in Roanoke, 
Va., for not telling him of the test results. The malpractice lawsuit, believed 
to be one of the first of its kind in the country was filed on behalf of S. 
Michael Long, a divorced salesman. Long, 39, said he requested the test for 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 1987 while he was being treated for 
kidney stones at Roanoke's Community Hospital because he had been given blood 
transfusions in 1980. "If I knew then what I know now, I would have been 
abstinent," Long said. "I would never dream of passing this virus on." Kenneth 
E. Labowitz, an Alexandria, Va., attorney who represents Long, said there have 
been very few AIDS-related malpractice cases.

CHILDREN'S INSURANCE PLAN CLEARS PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ground-breaking legislation that would give a new tax credit of up to $500 a 
year to low-income working Americans to help them buy health insurance for 
their children was approved by the Senate Finance Committee. Debate on the 
measure may produce sparks -- not only because of the innovative new health tax 
credit, but also because it takes a more modest approach to child care benefits 
than another major Democratic initiative. "I know there is going to be a big 
battle with the ABC bill on the floor," said Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), a 
committee member and the Senate GOP leader. "Maybe we'll end up without any 
child care bill at all." The ABC bill is a measure by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd 
(D-Conn.) that envisions a much more expensive child care program.

Orange County supervisors rejected a proposed ordinance that would have banned 
discrimination against AIDS victims, making the county the only major urban 
area in California without such a measure. The 3-2 vote before a tense and 
emotional crowd capped an 18-month study by the county's HIV Advisory Committee 
that concluded that the ordinance was necessary to reduce the spread of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome by making its victims more likely to seek 
treatment. Opposition was led by the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's Anaheim-based 
Traditional Values Coalition.

Rewards of up to $5 million would be offered for the capture of big-time drug 
dealers under a plan offered by U.S. Customs Commissioner William Von Rabb. 
Known as Operation Paladin for the gun-slinger in the television show "Have Gun 
Will Travel," the reward fund would tap money from the Customs Service's asset 
forfeiture fund. A congressional source familiar with the plan said Customs was 
drawing up a most wanted list, and that it starts with Panamanian Gen. Manuel 
Antonio Noriega. Also being considered for the list are leaders of the ruthless 
Medellin and Cali cartels of Colombia, and an alleged drug dealer from Mexico, 
the sources said.

A letter from 154 members of the House of Representatives urged President Bush 
to uphold all current anti-abortion policies. "Send an early, clear and 
unmistakable signal of your intention to veto any appropriations or 
authorization measure that would undo or weaken current law regarding 
abortion," the lawmakers wrote. The representatives number more than the 
one-third that would be needed to sustain a presidential veto. Rep. Christopher 
H. Smith (R-N.J.) co-chairman of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, said the 
letter was not aimed at a particular effort to change U.S. abortion policy, but 
that with a decision expected soon in a Missouri abortion case before the 
Supreme Court, more action on the issue is expected.

PISTONS END A REIGN, CAP A CAREER; 
</P>
<P>
DETROIT SWEEPS LAKERS, 105-97 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the team of the '80s, having won five titles in eight trips to the National 
Basketball Assn. finals, the Lakers have watched the decade fade away -- and 
their championship reign with it. 
</P>
<P>
The next decade will be ushered in by the Detroit Pistons, the self-proclaimed 
"Bad Boys" who earned their first NBA championship Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Seizing upon the injuries that sidelined Magic Johnson and Byron Scott, the 
Pistons completed a series sweep of the Lakers with a 105-97 victory at the 
Forum before 17,505, who bid farewell to retiring center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
Torch passing seemed the night's foremost activity as the Pistons put a 
stranglehold on the championship trophy that had eluded the franchise for 32 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Led by guard Joe Dumars, who scored 23 points and was unanimously voted the 
series' most valuable player, the Pistons savored this one with all the passion 
that they put into their aggressive and unyielding play. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great to win," Piston guard Isiah Thomas said. "They are the team of 
the '80s, and we've learned a lot from the Lakers. There's nothing better than 
beating the champions." 
</P>
<P>
For the Lakers, Tuesday marked the passing of an era. Abdul-Jabbar eased into 
retirement, scoring seven points and missing his last six skyhooks as the 
Lakers' bid for a third consecutive title ended just as unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a Laker "three-peat," the Pistons felt long overdue to unseat the 
champions. They fell a game short in last season's championship series, when 
Isiah Thomas was hobbled by an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the Pistons wondered all summer about what might have happened had 
injuries not befallen them, the Lakers no doubt will have similar thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
They were 11-0 in the playoffs before Scott suffered a partially torn hamstring 
on the eve of the series opener. Then, in Game 2, Magic Johnson strained his 
left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Without them, the Lakers seemed without a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Not even James Worthy, who scored 40 points, could make up for the loss of the 
league's most valuable player and the Lakers' only consistent outside scoring 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already thought about it," said Abdul-Jabbar, when asked whether the 
outcome might have changed had injuries not struck. "But that's fate, and 
there's nothing you can do about that. Muslims refer to that as Kismet." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons refer to it perhaps as poetic justice, or at least, payback for 
last season's disappointment. Rather than wallow in it, the Pistons said they 
used their near-miss as motivation for winning the championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a greater will than anyone else to win from Day 1," Dumars said. "It 
was a terrible feeling last year in the locker room. . . . It was the worst 
feeling I can ever remember. But now the Bad Boys are doing a lot of talking." 
</P>
<P>
In this series, however, the Pistons remained on their best behavior most of 
the time. There were the usual shoving and woofing, but the Lakers matched them 
in those categories, if nowhere else. 
</P>
<P>
So, it wasn't Detroit's thuggish reputation that accounted for only the sixth 
championship series sweep, the last being in 1983, when the Philadelphia 76ers 
brushed aside another injury-riddled Laker team. 
</P>
<P>
It simply was talent. Dumars emerged as more than just a defensive specialist 
and a nice guy. He averaged 27.3 points in the series, repeatedly exploiting 
the Lakers' half-court trap and taking advantage of their depleted backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Backcourt mates Thomas and Vinnie Johnson also were impressive. Thomas and 
Johnson, who each scored 14 points Tuesday, combined with Dumars to account for 
almost half of the Pistons' points. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important was the Pistons' unrelenting team defense. In 15 of 17 
playoff games, the Pistons held opponents under 100 points. The Lakers broke 
that mark twice in the finals, but on this night they fell short again. 
</P>
<P>
And regardless of the injuries, the Pistons said they would have stopped the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, you have to feel that, that we would've won it anyway," Dumars said. "If 
they (Johnson and Scott) would have been on the floor, we still would have come 
out and thought we were the best team. We played like it." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of Scott and Johnson, Worthy did his best to hoist the Lakers 
onto his sturdy shoulders and at least lead them to one victory. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 14 minutes, it appeared that Worthy could indeed help the Lakers 
avoid a sweep. He scored 17 first-quarter points, enabling the Lakers to take a 
40-24 lead two minutes into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Though trailing by 16 points, the Pistons hardly felt threatened. At least, 
that is what they said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Just not pain," Dumars said when asked what he felt in the first half. "We 
just had to maintain our composure. I remember in '83, Philly was down by 15 in 
the first half (of Game 4) and swept. Same situation. I felt we could come 
back, and we did. 
</P>
<P>
"And when we finally did come back, the clock seemed to take forever to run 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons made their move in the second quarter, denying Worthy the ball, and 
double-teamming Abdul-Jabbar, who scored 24 points in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
In the final 10 minutes of the half, the Pistons outscored the Lakers, 25-15, 
to trail by only six. With Rick Mahorn defending him, Worthy was held to four 
points and four shots in the second quarter, and Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Cooper 
and David Rivers went cold. 
</P>
<P>
Despite making only 46% of their field-goal attempts and 62% of their free 
throws, the Pistons still found themselves within striking distance at the 
start of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers must have realized Detroit was circling for the kill when Bill 
Laimbeer opened the third quarter by swishing a three-point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than recoil, the Lakers fought back. In the first six minutes of the 
third quarter, Worthy scored 12 of the Lakers' 14 points. He made all five 
shots he attempted, and the Lakers held a three-point lead that dwindled to two 
entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, the Lakers were fatigued and in foul trouble, and the Pistons 
seemed intent on clinching the title they felt was rightly theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons' depth was most obvious in the fourth quarter. With reserves James 
Edwards, Dennis Rodman and Johnson taking charge, Detroit grabbed the lead with 
10 minutes to play and never saw it slip below three the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards scored all 13 of his points in the fourth quarter but, perhaps 
fittingly, it was Dumars who put away the Lakers for good by sinking a jump 
shot with 1:04 to play that gave the Pistons a six-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, that would send the Forum fans streaming for the exits. But most 
remained seated to honor Abdul-Jabbar, whose final seconds of his 20-year 
career were played out to chants of "Kareem, Kareem." 
</P>
<P>
Realizing the historical significance of the Abdul-Jabbar's farewell, the 
Pistons paused to join the crowd and the Lakers in giving Abdul-Jabbar a long 
ovation when he was replaced with 19 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
But when the buzzer sounded, the night belonged to the Pistons. Isiah Thomas 
christened the Pistons' first championship by heaving the ball to the ceiling. 
Mobbed by his teammates, Thomas was tucked on the right hip of teammate John 
Salley as the Pistons then sprinted off the court. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who has said that the quest of winning a championship consumed him like 
a disease, was aglow afterward, amid the flow of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like I'm in heaven and I'm floating," Thomas said. "It's a great 
feeling. I've always wanted to say I'm No. 1, and now we are. 
</P>
<P>
"We won because we've been an unselfish team all year. We won because we are 
dedicated to each other and disciplined enough as athletes to learn from our 
experiences and come back next year and just add to our knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, who finished 68-29, vowed to be back, as well. 
</P>
<P>
An era may be ending with Abdul-Jabbar's retirement, but Magic Johnson said, 
hamstring willing, the Lakers will try to begin the '90s the way they started 
this decade -- with a championship. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't ease the pain in Johnson's hamstring or heart, but he said it will 
fuel his resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the toughest thing I've ever had to deal with in my life -- not being 
able to play and help my team out," Johnson said. "It'll live with me all 
summer and next year. We just didn't get it done, but our hats go off to the 
Pistons. They did it all season. They deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're not going anywhere. We'll be back. Champions never die off. We may 
get older, but . . . "

MIKE DOWNEY: FINALLY, IT'S ONE MO-TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This one was for everybody back in Motortown. This one was for everybody who 
paid hard cash during hard times, for everybody who followed the bouncing ball 
from Ft. Wayne, Ind., to Detroit, to Pontiac, Mich., to Auburn Hills, for 
everybody who waited and waited and waited -- from 1941 to 1989 -- for a team 
named after an engine part to finally sit in professional basketball's driver's 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
This one was for suffering coaches from Red Rocha to Donnis Butcher to Herb 
Brown to Scotty Robertson. This one was for suffering players from Sweetwater 
Clifton to Otto Moore to Kevin Porter to Kelly Tripucka. This one was for 
suffering fans who had not seen a Detroit team win the championship of any 
major sport, other than baseball, since the Lions won the National Football 
League title in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Mo-time. 
</P>
<P>
"This one's for everybody who ever played a part in this," Isiah Thomas said 
between kisses and hugs in the Piston dressing room Tuesday night at the Forum 
after his team polished off the Lakers in four straight, 105-97, Mo-time over 
Showtime. "You try to win a trophy, you get knocked down, knocked out, banged 
up, you fire coaches, you hire new players, you change stadiums, you just keep 
plugging and plugging and pray that your day will finally come. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just so -- what can I say? -- proud to be part of the first Piston team 
ever to win a championship. And to beat great people like the Lakers, I'm . . . 
I'm just . . . I'm just overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
So was Mark Aguirre, who broke down crying, wiping his eyes and then needlessly 
apologizing for it, saying: "I don't know why I'm doing this. This is the 
happiest day of my life. Why am I crying? I guess I'm crying because I never 
thought this was going to happen for me." 
</P>
<P>
And he doubled over until he could hardly speak. 
</P>
<P>
John Salley could speak. John Salley was born speaking. John Salley got his 
hands on the golden trophy that represented the championship, cradled it and 
kept stroking it, on and on and on, never letting go, talking to it, sometimes 
like a lover, sometimes like a daddy to a baby. 
</P>
<P>
"Yo, baby, how you doing?" Salley whispered to the trophy, running his hand 
across the golden basketball-shaped end, planting tiny kisses all over it. 
"Looking good, baby. You want to come home with me tonight? Yes, you do. Yes, 
you do. Gimme little kiss, c'mon now." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other Pistons watched him with ever-widening eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Y'all seen my gal here?" Salley asked. "C'mon, kiss my gal." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer did. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon, give her some sugar," Salley said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Mahorn did. 
</P>
<P>
"Sal-Sal's got himself a trophy, don't he?" Salley said, hugging it even 
tighter than before. 
</P>
<P>
Mo-time. 
</P>
<P>
Boston has its banners dangling from the ceiling. Philadelphia has its retired 
jerseys. The Lakers have their Magic moments, not to mention their Wilt and 
Jerry and Kareem moments. 
</P>
<P>
What do the Pistons have? 
</P>
<P>
They have a lot of background and little to show for it. They have 32 years 
invested in Detroit's city and suburbs alone, but it took them until 1988 just 
to make it as far as the NBA finals. And yet they have as loyal a following as 
any club in the league, regularly topping the NBA in attendance, even becoming 
the first franchise to draw a million fans in one season. 
</P>
<P>
How loyal are these Mo-men and Mo-women? 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the Pistons defeat the Lakers Tuesday night, they outdrew them. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. The attendance at the Forum was 17,505, a sellout. The attendance 
at the Palace of Auburn Hills -- just to watch the game on big-screen TV -- was 
21,454, also a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
Mo-time. 
</P>
<P>
This one was for everybody with Detroit connections, both home and away. It was 
for Thomas (I Got Robbed) Hearns, who dropped by one night after his 
controversial fight. It was for Adrian (I Got . . .) Dantley, who, like Hearns, 
felt he deserved a better deal. It was for Lee (Have I Got a Deal for You) 
Iacocca, who watched from courtside. It was for Rick (I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka) 
Mahorn, who won the Laker vote as the Dirtiest Player Alive. 
</P>
<P>
This one was for Leon (the Barber) Bradley, the most annoying fan in the NBA, 
who has spent much of the last three decades sitting right behind the bench of 
Piston opponents, ragging on them something awful. This one was for the 
gone-but-not-forgotten "Classy Chassis," the only cheerleading squad in NBA 
history, we believe, to perform in stiletto heels. 
</P>
<P>
Piston history? There isn't much else to tell. Do you know how many Detroit 
Pistons have been named to NBA postseason All-Star teams -- first or second 
five -- since 1963? Two: Dave Bing and Isiah Thomas. Know how many Detroiters 
have been NBA coach of the year? One: Ray Scott, 1974. Know how many Detroit 
Pistons have made the NBA's All-Defense first five? None. 
</P>
<P>
So, how did this become a championship team? Through hard work and, apropos for 
a Motor City business, by making good deals. Also, lest we forget, Detroit 
deserved its 1989 NBA title because with all the attention paid to L.A.'s 
injuries, the Pistons survived Thomas' hamstring pull, Laimbeer's pinched 
nerve, Dennis Rodman's back spasms and Michael Jordan's basket spasms. 
</P>
<P>
They were stereotyped as a "lunch-pail," blue-collar team, even though they 
play in one of the nation's wealthiest counties and have a millionaire's son at 
center. It was the usual starting lineup of the Lakers that hailed from 
Lansing, Mich.; Gastonia, N.C., Portland, Ore., New York and Inglewood, but why 
not perpetuate old notions until the very end, as when Brent Musburger casually 
announced, before Tuesday's game, that: "No team plays with as much pride as 
the Lakers." Oh, is that a fact? 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons went out the way they came in, making fun of their own reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Bad Boys!" they sang in the locker room, turning it almost into a chant. "Bad 
Boys! Bad Boys! Bad Boys!" 
</P>
<P>
These guys weren't bad. They were good. 
</P>
<P>
And brace yourself, because they expect to be back. 
</P>
<P>
Because you know what they want. 
</P>
<P>
One Mo. 
</P>
<P>
AND SO IT GOES

SCOTT OSTLER: IT'S OK, LAKERS OWN THE DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago they were a new and different team, sneaking up on the rest of 
the league, taking basketball by surprise with a new style of ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Showtime," they called it, and there were snickers around the league. Or was 
it honest skepticism? 
</P>
<P>
"Cute concept," the world said, "but show us what you can do. See us in six 
months." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were led by a dazzling rookie and a rejuvenated veteran superstar, 
and they featured a hungry-looking, hyperactive sixth man and a dapper and 
eager assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
Magic, Kareem, Cooper and Riley. 
</P>
<P>
They had a rookie owner, too, who wiped the champagne out of his eyes 10 years 
ago in Philadelphia and said sincerely, "You don't know how long I've waited 
for this." 
</P>
<P>
The team had sexy dancing girls, Hollywood fans, a beautiful gym, a lot of 
frills and gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
A passing fad. 
</P>
<P>
The fad finally passed Tuesday night, a decade later. The rest of the league 
finally caught up with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest run in pro athletics in this decade came to an end, not with a 
bang but with a twang, two hamstrings coming unstrung at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
With their starting guards out, the Lakers took the Detroit Pistons into the 
final two minutes of the last three games of the series before losing each. 
</P>
<P>
"Shrivel" was a word used by one Detroit newspaper headline writer to describe 
what the Lakers did in Game 1 of the series, when Johnson joined Scott on the 
all-one-legged team. 
</P>
<P>
Bad hamstrings, yes. 
</P>
<P>
Dishpan heart, no. 
</P>
<P>
This is no team to send out with faint praise, but what team ever looked better 
being swept? 
</P>
<P>
Some of the players Coach Pat Riley was sending into the games in this series 
hadn't played before actual live people in months, or years, since Riley closes 
his practices. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they went to the wire three straight games with the Bad Boys, who are 
pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
Riley got shut out again this season in the Coach of the Year voting. No big 
deal. When they get around to choosing the All-Decade team, Riley will be the 
coach. Why even bother to vote? 
</P>
<P>
Any doubters had to be swept away when Riley re-invented his team during the 
last week. Let's see what Riley can do if they strip him of the game's greatest 
player and the team's only real outside shooter, on a team that was already as 
shallow as the female lead in a grade-B movie. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of crumbling, the Lakers played like Tony Campbell and David Rivers had 
been in their backcourt all season. 
</P>
<P>
Think it's been easy for Riley? In Detroit the guy sneaks out to the hotel pool 
one afternoon to recharge his solar batteries. That evening he sees himself on 
the 6 o'clock news, his sunbath captured by a spy-cam. Jackie Onassis could've 
told Riley it would get like this. 
</P>
<P>
After the sweep was completed Tuesday night, the Lakers weren't very poetic. At 
a time like this, it's hard to put a decade into words. Where's Winston 
Churchill when you really need him? 
</P>
<P>
But think about it -- five world championships in 10 years. Three other trips 
to the finals, and to stretch a point here, if not for injuries like the 
Scott-Johnson double-twang, the Lakers could've been 8 for 10 this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the speculation and rely on the hard facts and it still comes out this 
way: The Lakers defined the 1980s in sports. Wire to wire, style and substance, 
speed and grace. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago in the visitor's locker room at the Spectrum, Magic cried and 
Kareem smiled and Cooper grinned. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been dramatic for the Lakers to close out the decade as winners, 
wire to wire champagne, but reality intruded. 
</P>
<P>
They showered and dressed quietly, and dryly, and left the Forum. Kareem will 
not be back as a player. Cooper, who knows? Driven for a decade by insecurity, 
Cooper will enjoy more of the same over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Scott is no sure thing to return. Moves must be made. Jerry West, the general 
manager whose moves kept the Lakers competitive for a decade even though the 
draft was continually stacked against them, will be wheeling and dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Even Jerry Buss is no sure thing to return next year as Laker owner. He might 
decide to trade himself to a football team, or a baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Magic will be back, surely, but what kind of show will he have to lead? 
</P>
<P>
Jerry West, who knows? This is a man who digs deeper into the game and suffers 
more for his team than any executive I've known. Will he retire, or see what 
kind of rebuilding he can do with second-round draft picks? 
</P>
<P>
Magic will be back, surely, but what kind of show will he have to lead? 
</P>
<P>
But that's the future. Right now would be a good time to pause and look back on 
a decade of great basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaal Wilkes and Norm Nixon passing the torch to James Worthy and Scott. Jim 
Chones and Bob McAdoo passing the torch to Kurt Rambis and Mychal Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Too many names to mention, too many great moments to recall. They go by in a 
blur, like the classic Laker fast break, now known as a transition game, and in 
recent days, rarely seen. 
</P>
<P>
Magic's passing, Kareem's skyhook, Worthy's knifing drives, Cooper's flying 
drawstrings. Riley thinking, West pacing, Buss watching. 
</P>
<P>
You can't put it all on film, you can't really describe it. It was there and 
now it is gone. It seems like a short decade. Time flies when you're enjoying 
yourself.

VIEWERS MISS END WHEN CABLE IS CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 20,000 homes were blacked out in the last hour of the National Basketball 
Assn. finals game at the Forum Tuesday night when a cable line was severed, 
cutting service to the Eagle Rock, Highland Park and Lincoln Heights areas of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rosendahl, president of Century Cable, said his company's service was 
interrupted at 7:40 p.m. when a cable a Mt. Washington receiving station was 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
Some customers missed the end of Game 4 of the Lakers-Detroit Pistons series, 
which was won by the Pistons in four games. Rosendahl said service was restored 
by 8:45 p.m.

FINISH DISAPPOINTS ABDUL-JABBAR, BUT HE'S NOT SAD HIS TIME RAN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And so it ended . . . 
</P>
<P>
After 20 seasons and 1,815 National Basketball Assn. games, counting the 
regular season, playoffs and All-Star appearances, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came out 
for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen seconds remained in the final game of the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
The fans stood and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons stood and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar showed little expression. He kept his goggles on. After a while, 
he nodded his head and said, "Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to enjoy the moment and take it all in and receive the crowd," he 
said later. "I gave my teammates one last hug. That's the last time I'll be 
able to do it on the hardwood." 
</P>
<P>
Play resumed and time ran out. Game, series, season and career. 
</P>
<P>
Thus did Abdul-Jabbar pass into basketball history, after 20 NBA seasons, four 
more than anyone has ever lasted, and 37,639 regular-season points -- 44,149 
altogether -- and most of the important records in the game. Love him, hate 
him, don't give a damn about him, but where he walked, no one will soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 42, he passes over into civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
How will he begin it? 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know," he said. "Probably sleep 'til 1 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
His passing was awkward. The Pistons, who'd played him with one man and watched 
him go for 24 points and 13 rebounds Sunday, paid him the compliment of 
double-teaming him, as in days of yore. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar sagged to seven points and three rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
He tried six last skyhooks -- five actually, with one impromptu jump hook 
thrown in -- and missed them all. 
</P>
<P>
He took down only three rebounds. Late in the game, with the Lakers still 
within 100-96, he couldn't react fast enough to pick up Joe Dumars' miss one 
step away and John Salley got it, instead. Moments later, Dumars knocked in a 
17-footer, effectively putting the game on ice. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, someone suggested, Kareem would have preferred to have it end after Game 
3? 
</P>
<P>
"No," said Abdul-Jabbar. "I wish it was Game 5, 6 or 7. Like I said, I just 
wish we could have lasted longer. The other numbers are unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed. I'm not sad. We knew we were going uphill, without our best 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to wonder about it (how a healthy Laker team would have fared). I 
already have wondered about it. But I can't dwell on it. That's the way the 
hand was dealt." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, what did he have to complain about? 
</P>
<P>
He had a long, distinguished professional career. 
</P>
<P>
He got his wish, to be traded back to Los Angeles, where he'd gone to college. 
</P>
<P>
He was already a 10-year veteran when the Lakers picked up Magic Johnson to go 
with him, kicking off a run of five titles and three more trips to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't have been any better," Abdul-Jabbar said. "Not when I can remember 
growing up on the streets of Manhattan and hoping I got to play one pro season. 
I outlasted everybody. I got to play with the greats of the game." 
</P>
<P>
How did he think he'd done? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I did pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
How did retirement feel? Perhaps with a surging crowd of people bearing pens, 
tape recorders, minicams and sound booms bearing down on him, he didn't feel so 
retired quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hasn't set in, as far as deeper meanings," he said. "I'm just 
thankful I've been able to last this long and walk out the door. I thank the 
Almighty for that. After that . . . we'll see what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of days ago, Abdul-Jabbar said he wouldn't get involved in basketball 
in another capacity, that he had had enough competition for a while. 
</P>
<P>
How about working with kids? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, my kids," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got some things in the fire," he said Tuesday night. "I'm going to try to 
do some acting . . . I have four little people I have to find out what they're 
doing, get more involved in their lives. I think it'll keep me pretty busy." 
</P>
<P>
It was about then that Magic Johnson brought one of his sisters through the 
media melee to kiss Kareem goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you work with a guy whose whole objective is to get you the ball, you 
gotta love him," Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
Did he plan to say anything to Johnson about the passing of the torch. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic knows what to do with it," said former Laker great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

They came, they saw, and they saw some more, mostly the other team winning. But 
celebrate the Lakers did not, not for a third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
Destiny came calling Tuesday night on the Lakers in resounding fashion, a 
four-game sweep by the Detroit Pistons in the NBA finals. The response, while 
not noted in the history books, was, "Yeah, but what if . . . " 
</P>
<P>
What if Byron Scott had not missed the series because of a partially torn left 
hamstring, suffered in practice the day before Game 1 a week ago Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
What if Magic Johnson, the league's regular-season most valuable player and the 
other Laker starting guard, had not missed practically all of the last two 
games, playing only 4 minutes 46 seconds Sunday, thanks to a strained left 
hamstring? 
</P>
<P>
What if the Lakers did not lose Game 2 on the road by three points, 108-105, 
while giving up five in technical fouls? 
</P>
<P>
"I think if they had won by 15 or 16, we still would have wondered what if," 
Scott said after the Pistons' 105-97 victory at the Forum wrapped up the title. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a car with two wheels off," Coach Pat Riley said. "But the Pistons took 
control of that, and that's why we are where we are." 
</P>
<P>
Just where that is, beyond a fast arrival into the off-season, has yet to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
"What could have been is something that will go down in the record books," 
Riley said. "There's no asterisk next to their (the Pistons') championship; 
they deserve it. But the historical significance, that will always bother me 
because we had all those lost opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what gnaws at me the most. Not diminishing what the Pistons did, but 
the hole in my stomach will always be there from not knowing. 
</P>
<P>
"We were primed. We were ready. We blew through the playoffs. Then, at the 11th 
hour, fate struck, and we never had a chance to gather ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said: "It's an empty feeling because we never got a real chance. It's an 
empty feeling. That's pretty much all you can say." 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge: "It's very frustrating. We went out and played as hard as we 
could with what we had. But we're always going to wonder what might have 
happened. What might have happened with Byron and Magic." 
</P>
<P>
Scott: "It's always going to be hard not to think about Earvin and myself not 
being in there. There's going to be questions in a lot of people's minds, and 
ours. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't compare to any other (series loss), not participating. It was 
devastating. I thought possibly it (the injury) was feeling better. I was 
hoping the series would go a couple more games and I could get back into shape 
to play. It's something I will have to live with. There will always be 
questions, buts and ifs, but they are champions now." 
</P>
<P>
What remains are memories, some worth saving, but most to be thrown away. As 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I grabbed his (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's) jersey when he left it," Riley said of 
his souvenir, part of the last Laker uniform Abdul-Jabbar will ever wear. "It 
was sweaty, but I grabbed it anyway. . . . It will hang in my closet, with all 
those Armani threads of mine." 
</P>
<P>
That was one of the few keepers.

'BAD BOY' PISTONS MAKE GOOD ON DALY'S DREAM

Detroit Piston trainer Mike Abdenour hugged Coach Chuck Daly as the clock ran 
out in the Pistons' 105-97 title-clinching victory over the Lakers Tuesday 
night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations Chuck!" Abdenour said. "You worked your entire life for this!" 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons credited Daly for guiding them to their first National Basketball 
Assn. title. 
</P>
<P>
Said John Salley: "Chuck was the man. He believed in us and motivated us and 
made sure our heads didn't get too big so we got it done." 
</P>
<P>
The title was especially satisfying for Daly, who was fired from his first NBA 
head coaching job with the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Daly coached at Pennsylvania and Boston College before spending four years as 
an assistant with the Philadelphia 76ers. He joined Detroit in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys go through their whole coaching career and don't win any 
championships but they're great coaches," Daly said as he accepted 
congratulations from well-wishers in the Pistons' dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this is kind of a dream come true. All those years I've watched 
everyone else win a title and I never figured that I'd quite get it, but this 
club put it together all year." 
</P>
<P>
Piston forward Mark Aguirre cried after winning his first title. His wife 
Angela wiped away his tears. 
</P>
<P>
The Piston forward, branded a loser after failing to win a championship at 
Chicago's Westinghouse High School and DePaul University, was delirious. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me that having a kid is the most joyous moment of your life. I can't 
wait for it because if it's better than this I don't know what it's going to be 
like," Aguirre said. "This is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons' title was especially satisfying to sportscaster Dick Vitale, who 
coached the Detroit from 1978-80. 
</P>
<P>
"This one was for you," a Piston fan told Vitale, who broadcast the game over 
the ABC radio network. 
</P>
<P>
Vitale said he felt like a part of the title. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fantastic for the whole city and everybody involved that they got 
a championship," Vitale said. "I think it's just a fantastic moment for all the 
fans who had to labor and struggle for all those years and all the players who 
wore the uniform in the past like Bob Lanier and Dave Bing. It's just a great 
moment in Detroit basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson wore basic black -- shirt, trousers, shoes and mood -- when he 
walked into the Laker locker room before Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, after a brief examination by Dr. Robert Kerlan, Johnson was 
ruled out of the game because of his strained left hamstring. He joined 
teammate Byron Scott, out because of a partially torn left hamstring, in street 
clothes on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew," Kerlan said. "We didn't try (to have Johnson run)." 
</P>
<P>
Kerlan also said that Johnson had suffered no regression or aggravation of his 
sprained hamstring after playing 4 minutes 46 seconds in Game 3 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We left it up to him for that game," Kerlan said. "He was running and moving 
all right (Sunday) in the boiler room (where Johnson tested the hamstring)." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Laker forward Mychal Thompson made the all-interview team in a poll 
of NBA writers. 
</P>
<P>
The first team: Charles Barkley of Philadelphia, Karl Malone of Utah, Michael 
Jordan of Chicago, Doc Rivers of Atlanta and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The second team: Thompson, Kevin McHale of Boston, Danny Ainge of Sacramento, 
Rolando Blackman of Dallas and Reggie Theus of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Piston forward John Salley received honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
Said Thompson, who figured he deserved first-team recognition: "Definitely an 
oversight. But I'm used to being unappreciated. When I was a kid, and I used to 
clean the yard, my dad wouldn't appreciate what I did, either." 
</P>
<P>
When guard Vinnie Johnson of the Pistons needs a quick rush of energy, he takes 
ginseng, a Chinese herb. 
</P>
<P>
"Three hours before the game, I take two ginseng capsules," Johnson said. 
"During the course of the game if I feel I need extra juice, I drink a couple 
of vials of ginseng extract." 
</P>
<P>
The ginseng craze is catching on around the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cooper, James Worthy and Thompson of the Lakers swear by ginseng. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you a quick rush of energy legally," Thompson said. "And it gives you 
more stamina."

The California Assembly approved a bill that would prohibit giving most drugs 
or medications to horses for 48 hours before race time. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Assemblyman Dick Floyd would allow oral doses and topical 
applications of antibiotics, electrolytes, vitamins, tetanus antitoxin, 
dimethyl sulfoxide and antiseptic ointments to be used 24 hours or more before 
race time. Also, the bill would allow other drugs such as antihistamines and 
worming medications to be used more than 72 hours before race time. Drugs not 
listed in the bill would be prohibited within one week of race time. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd said a test by an independent laboratory of 1,024 urine samples taken 
from horses racing at California tracks showed 109 positive for 21 illegal 
substances.

BIONDI EXPECTED TO RETURN TO SWIMMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matt Biondi, winner of seven Olympic swimming medals in Seoul last September, 
is expected to make his comeback as a swimmer next month. 
</P>
<P>
A comeback has been anticipated since Biondi quit the U.S. national water polo 
team last week, toward the end of a trip to Moscow and Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was the first Biondi had made as a member of the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, who had worked out with the water polo team off and on since January, 
told Coach Bill Barnett that he was leaving the team while members were 
training in Berlin, according to Mike Sutton, team manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Barnett told me that Matt said he just didn't have the competitive drive 
to work his way up the ladder again," Sutton said. "He's really enjoying the 
work he's doing with his environmental projects and some of the other 
activities that are the fruits of his success in swimming, and he didn't want 
to make the commitment it would take to play international-level water polo. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we were all disappointed. I think Matt could have become a top 
player. But the key word there is become. It would have taken a lot of time. 
It's a big step to go from college water polo (he was an All-American at 
California) to international water polo." 
</P>
<P>
Biondi's mother, Lucille, said that Biondi had called home Sunday from Berlin 
and told his parents that he was leaving the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He really didn't say much about his plans," she said. "All he said was that he 
couldn't compete for the water polo team because he didn't think he could 
afford the time commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton said: "His schedule has been incredible. I'm sure he's tired. But I 
think he would like to get back into swimming. He and Tom Jager could still 
have some great races. I think they see some marketability there." 
</P>
<P>
Jager and Biondi have discussed the drawing power of rematches of the sprint 
races he and Biondi have had over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, who finished second to Biondi in the 50-meter freestyle in Seoul a few 
days before his 24th birthday, stayed in swimming, proving that a sprinter can 
continue to compete beyond college age while holding a full-time job. Biondi is 
23. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi has been active with endorsements and appearances and reportedly has 
been able to cash in big on his Olympic gold. But, according to Jeff Dimond, a 
spokesman for U.S. Swimming, there would be no question of his eligibility and 
amateur status if he wanted to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt has run all of his earnings through his swim fund, which FINA (the 
international governing body) administrates," Dimond said. "He had to do that 
to keep his eligibility for water polo. But both sports come under FINA, so 
there would be no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Biondi is currently in the Bahamas working on an environmental film. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Fick, meet director for the Los Angeles Invitational July 13-16 at USC, 
said that although he has heard that Biondi might be returning to swimming, he 
has had no official word from either Biondi, or his coach, Nort Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
"If he is coming back, though, he would have to swim in the national long 
course meet (also at USC) July 31-Aug. 4, because that's the selection meet for 
the teams that will compete in the Pan Pacific meet and in the U.S.S.R. meet," 
Fick said.

FRAN ALLISON, STAR OF TV'S 'KUKLA, FRAN &amp; OLLIE,' DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fran Allison, who as the winsome straight man for a bulb-nosed clown named 
Kukla and a one-toothed dragon called Ollie made up one of the most popular and 
beloved triumvirates in TV history, died Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
She was 81 and died at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital after a long struggle 
with bone marrow failure, an inability to produce enough blood cells, said 
Clark Dennis, her longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
She had been admitted to the hospital near her Van Nuys home on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Allison was a veteran radio comedienne, hostess and singer when she became 
the only visible human member of the late Burr Tillstrom's captivating 
contingent of hand puppets. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening about 7, she would sally forth to begin her always patient 
dialogues with Kukla, the pragmatic imp with the oversized nose, and Oliver J. 
Dragon, a talkative serpent from a long line of non-fire-breathing lizards. 
</P>
<P>
Their fragmented discourses, always extemporaneous but centered on themes that 
Tillstrom and Miss Allison had discussed before air time, were cheerful 
homilies offering guidance for young minds. 
</P>
<P>
From Nov. 29, 1948, when the show first went on national television -- after 
being on the air for a year or two in Chicago -- until Aug. 31, 1957, when it 
ended its national run to later move to public television, its cast of 
characters provided parents with wholesome respite. 
</P>
<P>
But the charming, soft-spoken island of sanity she became on "Kukla, Fran &amp; 
Ollie, " (kukla means doll in Russian) was not the character that first brought 
Frances Allison to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
Born in La Porte, Iowa, she gained her early radio experience in that state 
with a character she called "Aunt Fanny," a gossiping spinster who thrived on 
publicizing the best-kept secrets of her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aunt Fanny 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the station in Waterloo, Iowa, where she was showcasing Aunt 
Fanny, sent a transcription to Don McNeill, host of radio's popular "The 
Breakfast Club." 
</P>
<P>
Aunt Fanny, who came to the microphone as "She's Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage" 
played in the background, took her tattling to the huge national audience that 
made McNeill's mixture of sentiment and comedy a staple of the Depression Era. 
</P>
<P>
She also was heard as both comic and vocalist on such other variety radio shows 
as "Smile Parade," "Uncle Ezra's Radio Station" and "Meet the Meeks." 
</P>
<P>
When "The Breakfast Club" moved to television in 1950, Aunt Fanny went along. 
But McNeill's TV effort was short-lived, and in 1954, Miss Allison, a jazz 
aficionado with a wide range of interests, joined the highly respected panel of 
"Down You Go," a word game. 
</P>
<P>
She also was a part of "It's About Time," a historical TV quiz show of that 
same year, and "Let's Dance," a big-band spectacular that featured orchestras 
from both New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enduring Legacy 
</P>
<P>
But her enduring legacy will be as the voice of charm and reason for 
Tillstrom's puppet entourage, which also included Fletcher Rabbit, the mailman 
who had to starch his drooping ears for formal occasions; Beulah Witch and her 
rocket-propelled broomstick; Col. Crackie, the long-winded Confederate, and 
many more. 
</P>
<P>
She first met Tillstrom, who died in 1985, at Chicago station WBKB where he was 
developing a television format for the puppets he had exhibited at the 1940 New 
York World's Fair. 
</P>
<P>
The two of them mapped out 10 ideas that they believed would fill half an hour 
of air time. Over the years, the show ran alternately in 30-minute, 15-minute 
and 5-minute segments before moving to PBS from 1969 to 1971. It also ran in 
syndicated form from 1975 to 1976. Tillstrom provided all the puppets' voices 
but was never seen, while Miss Allison managed the running commentary.

<P>
MISSION RITUAL: CHECK THE CRACKS AFTER QUAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The day after twin earthquakes shook the Los Angeles region, Father Arnold 
Gonzales paused near a side wall of the San Gabriel Mission, trying to figure 
out -- as he does almost every time the ground trembles -- if any of the deep 
cracks lacing the 218-year-old building had grown bigger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say when you see these cracks all the time," the priest said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the historic mission has been living with cracks, jagged fissures 
and gaping holes ever since the 5.9-magnitude quake of October, 1987, sent 
chunks of mortar and concrete crashing to the ground. The building was 
immediately closed to the public, considered too badly damaged to be entered. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the mission, believed to be the oldest stone building in 
California, has been in a race against time. A citizens' committee has been 
trying to raise the money for the estimated $2-million repair job before 
another major quake destroys the landmark. 
</P>
<P>
When Monday's temblors -- of magnitude 4.5 and 4.3 -- struck, they rattled the 
mission chapel where Gonzales was conducting a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"All the people got hold of each other, and I thought, 'Here we go again,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But later, he climbed up to the bell tower, where the mission's famed six bells 
are set into individual arched recesses, and decided that the deep cracks 
caused by the 1987 Whittier quake looked no worse than they had before. In a 
quick tour of the exterior, the long nave inside the church and its domed 
baptistery, he found nothing more than "a couple of bricks fallen down and 
plaster." 
</P>
<P>
Still, one of the tiered cornices on top of the building -- already dislodged 
by the 1987 quake -- appeared to have slipped a little more. A structural 
engineer checked the mission late Tuesday, Gonzales said, and decided "in case 
of another earthquake, to shore up the walls inside and the bell tower." That 
work will begin in two or three weeks, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer is concerned that the building may not be able to withstand many 
more blows, Gonzales said, adding, "We don't know how weakened the structure 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're really afraid of is another five-point earthquake that lasts 20 
seconds," Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
The work will add to what Gonzales calls a "multiphased renovation project" 
which has already begun. It involves documenting how the mission looked in 1830 
and painstakingly restoring the ancient structure to the look of that period. 
The work will also require a detailed analysis of the materials used in the 
original construction. 
</P>
<P>
Some refurbishing had actually started before the 1987 quake, Gonzales said. 
The altar was restored, as were some of the church paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just doing this as money was available," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But now that has changed. While each new earthquake threatens to undermine the 
building further, the fund-raising has stalled. 
</P>
<P>
"We are more or less on hold right now," said Helen Nelson, the parish 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Whittier quake, Gonazles said, "we've received gifts 
from people in Alaska, Hawaii and Delaware -- from people who used to live here 
and heard about it. And from one little girl who sold aluminum cans and sent us 
$4." 
</P>
<P>
About 2,200 families in the parish have collected about $170,000. The state 
Office of Emergency Services also contributed $350,000 toward restoration of 
the museum. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no major foundation grants, however, Gonzales said. Nor has the 
Los Angeles Archdiocese allocated any funds for the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they're waiting for the Lotto too," Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
Mission officials are precluded from seeking government funds to restore the 
church "because of the separation of church and state." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the structural engineer and an architect were recently hired, 
even though only a fourth of the restoration funds have been raised, Gonzales 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The experts do not believe the old building can wait much longer, he added. 
Maybe more donations will come, Gonzales said, "when they begin working, when 
people can see something is happening."

DIXON DEFENDS WIFE'S MINORITY BUSINESS DEALINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the House Ethics Committee on Tuesday defended his wife's 
participation in a minority business enterprise at Los Angeles International 
Airport, asserting that she did not receive favoritism and was "very well 
qualified for this type of operation." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), whose committee 
investigated alleged ethics abuses by recently resigned House Speaker Jim 
Wright, insisted there was no connection between his wife's airport business 
and a lucrative contract awarded by the Ethics Committee to the Los Angeles law 
firm of Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Cochran is a member and former chairman of the 
Airport Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know all the criteria involved in such contracts," Dixon said, 
referring to the airport concessions franchise granted to his wife and a group 
of other minority investors. "But I must point out that the Airport Commission 
approved this contract. . . . And I have intentionally stayed out of it. I have 
never discussed with anyone, including Johnnie Cochran, anything about Betty 
Dixon's business." 
</P>
<P>
The Times and two other news organizations, the Associated Press and the Wall 
Street Journal, reported Tuesday that Betty Dixon earned more than $150,000 
over the last two years on concession contracts at the airport on an initial 
investment of less than $15,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
She derived the income by investing three years ago in two minority business 
firms that qualified for airport work under a government program for minority- 
and women-run enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm emphatic in telling you that Betty Dixon is very well qualified for this 
type of operation," Dixon said in an interview, citing her retail experience 
with a gift shop she operated in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
However, Betty Dixon acknowledged to The Times that she did little of the 
hands-on management work in the airport enterprises intended by the government 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Wall Street Journal disclosed that the Ethics Committee 
earlier in 1986 awarded a contract to Cochran's Los Angeles firm to lead a 
staff investigation into alleged financial irregularities involving former Rep. 
Fernand J. St Germain (D-R.I.). The panel's investigation concluded in April, 
1987, with no charges being filed against St Germain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells of Recommendation 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said that he had recommended Cochran, a longtime friend, for the job but 
that "he was interviewed and hired by the committee, not by me." He said 
Cochran's fee was $170,000 for about 14 months of work. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the investigation centered in Los Angeles and he was eminently 
qualified for the job," Dixon said. "He was formerly assistant district 
attorney of Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
Cochran also told The Times that the concession contracts and his committee 
appointment were unrelated. Cochran, who was Airport Commission chairman when 
the concession agreements were approved, said he and Dixon "never discussed his 
wife's business. That wasn't relevant to anything we talked about." 
</P>
<P>
At the time the concession franchise was awarded to Duty Free Shoppers, the 
prime contractor that had a joint venture with the minority firms, "we had no 
knowledge at all of Betty Dixon," Cochran said. "She never appeared in records 
or anything." 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, who succeeded Wright in the top House post last 
week, came to Dixon's defense Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, there is no impropriety of any kind," the Speaker said, 
adding that Betty Dixon's contract seems to be "a proper business arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles airport officials have said they will review the concession 
contracts to determine whether they are legal and meet the intent of the city's 
minority contracting policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case May Be Reviewed 
</P>
<P>
Irene Mields, senior attorney on the Federal Aviation Administration's general 
counsel staff, said the agency probably will review the case based on the 
recommendations of airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
One question at issue is how much work Betty Dixon did for her pay. Regulations 
published by the FAA's civil rights office state that officers of minority 
firms should serve in a hands-on management role and gain actual work 
experience. Absentee ownership is frowned upon. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Dixon, a director of the two firms, Mir Kanon Inc. and Peideau Inc., 
acknowledged in an interview that aside from attending periodic board meetings 
in Los Angeles, she has done no actual work at the airport concessions owned by 
the firms. 
</P>
<P>
A Washington resident, she spent most of her time in the capital while 
operating her gift shop, Much Ado About Something Inc., and now distributes 
advertising novelties from an office here. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband said that she intends to work at the facilities this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"What she wants to be able to do is bid independently on an airport concession 
someplace," Dixon said. "She realized that the only way to do that was first to 
get involved in a joint venture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of 10 Partners 
</P>
<P>
Betty Dixon was one of 10 partners recruited by Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd. 
Partnership, the world's largest duty-free concessionaire, to boost its 
minority and female participation and improve its chances of winning contracts 
to operate gift shops at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Among the charges the Ethics Committee lodged against Wright this spring after 
a yearlong investigation of his financial affairs was that his wife received an 
$18,000-a-year salary, use of a condominium and a car from a Fort Worth, Tex., 
firm while doing little work. The committee charged that the income should have 
been reported by Wright as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue is that while FAA guidelines favor local business people for 
minority contracts, three of Betty Dixon's partners live in Atlanta and -- like 
her -- do not appear to fit the usual minority-business qualification of 
"socially and economically disadvantaged individuals." 
</P>
<P>
All are highly successful businessmen -- Jesse Hill Jr., president of Atlanta 
Life Insurance Co.; Herman J. Russell, president of H.J. Russell Co., the 
nation's largest black-owned construction company; and Felker W. Ward Jr., a 
prominent attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Activist 
</P>
<P>
Hill has been a major force in Atlanta for decades. He played a key role in 
formulating civil rights strategy in the 1950s and 1960s and in the city's 
commercial and political life. Russell, a longtime friend of Hill, was the 
first black to serve on the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. Russell's company was 
the fourth-largest black industrial firm in the United States in 1987, with 
revenues that year of $141.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ward now has his own investment banking firm, called Ward &amp; Associates Inc. 
In September, 1988, he was elected to the board of the Atlanta Gas Light Co., 
the largest natural gas distribution company in the Southeast, serving more 
than 1 million customers in 215 Georgia communities. The three men, who are 40% 
owners of the duty-free shop at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, did not return 
calls from The Times.

LIFE ON A FAULT; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS GET EDGY WHEN THEIR WORLD DOESN'T WANT TO HOLD STILL

</HEADLINE>

<P>
Danny Grimes wakes up every day over a fault zone. He dresses in his Whittier 
apartment and drives west, along the same zone, to his job in Hollywood. Even 
there, he is still not out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Any day, any time, an earthquake can occur underfoot. It happened the morning 
of Oct. 1, 1987, destroying everything in his apartment "except the dirty 
dishes in the sink." It happened again Monday, first with a 4.5-magnitude quake 
and then a 4.3 aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes did not have to be told that it was the Elysian Park Fault. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared me so bad I was shaking like an alcoholic with the DTs," he said 
Tuesday. "My heart can't take another earthquake. I got a job offer in New 
York, and I wasn't considering it very seriously until yesterday morning." 
</P>
<P>
The longtime Whittier resident is just one of many thousands who live along the 
broad swath of the Elysian Park Fault, a crack or series of cracks about 10 
miles below the earth's surface, slicing through many of Los Angeles' most 
densely populated communities. 
</P>
<P>
The poorly mapped fault zone, more than five miles wide, runs beneath Whittier, 
Montebello, Commerce, Boyle Heights, downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Elysian 
Park, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. It roughly follows the base of the Santa 
Monica Mountains, north of the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the fault was an overlooked geological blemish. But now 
seismologists are calling the fault one of the more important in the region, 
capable of generating a quake of 7.0 magnitude or greater. 
</P>
<P>
It is a notion that sits poorly with Ursula Urias, a Montebello resident since 
1958. The quake two years ago knocked glasses from cabinets and sent ripples 
like ocean waves across her concrete patio. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was an explosion. I thought the atom bomb had hit," she recalled, 
laughing. "This one (Monday) was not as loud -- a small bomb." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Comes Next? 
</P>
<P>
Urias worries about what comes next. Like most residents on the fault line, she 
endures with nervous contentment, perhaps even a little pride, in her home over 
the fault. Every place, she said, has its drawbacks -- tornadoes, hurricanes, 
tidal waves. She emigrated from East Germany, where they have The Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"You take a little earthquake any time," she said philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents expressed surprised that a fault runs beneath their homes and 
businesses. According to Caltech seismologists, the fault does not necessarily 
mean that property directly above will suffer the worst of the damage in a big 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
The main force of the quake, occurring eight or 10 miles under the surface, may 
often be directed in a diagonal thrust to the surface and the hills or 
mountains shaken most severely would be several miles from the quake epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, some residents of the fault zone took the news with worried looks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just great," said Art Lira, owner of Montebello Copy Center on Whittier 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Press Begins to Shift 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's first jolt, the shop's 10,000-pound printing press -- a piece 
of equipment normally moved only with a forklift -- began shifting on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I started screaming," Lira's wife Lillian said. "It was terrible. But what can 
you do? We've been here 16 years. All our friends are here." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Federico, 44, of Beverly Hills moved with her husband from Indiana seven 
years ago. She doesn't regret it. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Our friends told us we were crazy, but we are not worried," she said, 
expressing some concern over the possibility that earthquake insurance rates 
may climb. "They have to live with floods and tornadoes, we have to live with 
earthquakes. We will still try to buy a house here." 
</P>
<P>
Dentist Alan Lewis, whose small office has withstood 47 years of wobbling 
terrain at the busy intersection of Brooklyn Avenue and Soto Street in Boyle 
Heights, likens the danger of quakes in Los Angeles to "snow in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis had even had tremors hit while he was drilling away inside a patient's 
mouth. But it has never caused a problem -- at least to the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Get Back to Work' 
</P>
<P>
"I just smile, look around to make sure the building isn't falling down around 
me, and get back to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents said the quakes are no problem at all. Jessie Jacquez, who has 
lived in Montebello for 28 years, said she didn't budge when Monday's hit, even 
when a neighbor outside screamed. 
</P>
<P>
Jacquez was too engrossed in a video of the movie "Witness." "It was a good 
part -- I didn't even get up," she said, "It was a very good movie." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Reta, 68, of Commerce said he and his wife must also be getting 
accustomed to the jolts. His wife went back to bed after Monday's first shaker. 
But still, quakes have haunted his nights. 
</P>
<P>
"I've dreamed about big earthquakes -- telephone lines going down, cars piling 
up, people going wild, running," Reta said. "I used to have them pretty often. 
I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School at Epicenter 
</P>
<P>
At the epicenter of Monday's quake -- according to the best estimates that 
seismologists could determine on Tuesday -- was Bandini Elementary School in 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The school has been hit before. It was so badly damaged during the 1987 quake 
that its main building was closed for the remainder of the 1987-88 school year, 
principal Raymond Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Students were taught in portable classrooms until the building was reopened 
this February, he said. They were introduced to regular monthly earthquake 
drills, which seemed to help them cope on Monday. Nearly every student dropped 
to the floor and got under a desk. Only a few cried. 
</P>
<P>
In teacher Luz Hernandez's first-grade class, a few well-drilled students 
wondered whether the jolt was even real. "At first they were asking me, 'Was it 
a practice one?' " the instructor recalled with a smile. "They were saying, 
'How did Mr. Rivera make (the classroom) move?' " 
</P>
<P>
Like other schools in the Montebello Unified District, Bandini has installed an 
emergency storage shed. It contains water, hard hats, medical supplies, 
portable restrooms, flashlights, crowbars and other items. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera hopes he never has to use them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Principal's Nightmare' 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's every principal's nightmare," he said, "that you're going to 
have a biggie and it's going to happen during school time." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hayman, founder of the renowned Giorgio Beverly Hills fashion store 27 
years ago, called Monday's quake "a warning for the people who live along this 
fault to be prepared. I plan to reinforce and refortify my home." 
</P>
<P>
Commerce resident Harold Villegas had just parked his car in Montebello on 
Monday when the whole vehicle began to shake. It shook so violently it struck 
the car in front of him, setting off the other car's burglar alarm. He didn't 
know what was happening until he saw people running out of a nearby building. 
</P>
<P>
But Villegas considers the inconvenience a small price to pay to live in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been shaken hard enough to think about relocating," he said. "L.A.'s 
the place. It's great here!"

THRUST FAULTS 
</P>
<P>
A thrust, or dip-slip, fault such as the Elysian Park Fault is deeply buried 
and those neighborhoods directly over it may not suffer the most destructive 
effects of an earthquake. The main force of the quake, occurring eight or 10 
miles under the surface, may often be directed in a diagonal thrust to the 
surface, and the hills or mountains shaken most severely would be several miles 
from the epicenter. The dip-slip fault may lie along a mainly horizontal or 
shallow-dipping plane. When a quake occurs, the upward thrust of one side of 
the fault (depicted above) produces elevation gains in "folds," or mountains, 
while ground on the other side of the fault sinks. 
</P>
<P>
The Elysian Park Fault has not been completely mapped. Scientists believe it 
generally follows the hill line west from the Whittier area through downtown, 
the Hollywood Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains to the coast, but its 
precise position is unknown in a number of areas.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER DISTRICT CHIEF GETS $12,000 RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The director of the Metropolitan Water District in Los Angeles received a 
$12,000 raise Tuesday, bringing his yearly pay to $170,000 -- the highest 
salary for a public official in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The water district board approved the raise for General Manager Carl Boronkay 
in a motion made by Organizational and Personnel Committee Chairman Ken Witt, 
heading off an earlier plan by the committee to give the director a $17,000 
boost in pay. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who voted against the $12,000 raise had actually been in favor of 
the larger increase, MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley called Boronkay's salary "outrageous," but Malinowski 
defended it. By comparison, Bradley earns $97,654 annually and Clifton Moore, 
director of the Department of Airports -- who is the highest paid Los Angeles 
city official -- makes $153,927.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'DOG PARK' MOVES TOWARD EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday moved toward extending the operation of 
the city's only official "dog park" for a second year. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, the City Council approved an ordinance that allowed dogs to run 
without leashes in the mornings and evenings in Laurel Canyon Park on the 
city's Westside. The park is in an affluent hillside neighborhood off 
Mulholland Drive above Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, and has since 
attracted hundreds of dog owners and their pets every week. 
</P>
<P>
The city's initial ordinance allowing dogs to run free in the park expires on 
Aug. 31. On Tuesday, council members voted in favor of ordering the city 
attorney to draft a new measure so the program can be continued for another 
year. The hours of operation, from dawn until 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. until 
dark, will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
Once drafted, the new ordinance must be approved by the council and Mayor Tom 
Bradley.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTORCYCLE SCAM FIGURE SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Monica man who was convicted of operating a $1.3-million marketing scam 
that promised customers a free motorcycle simply for test driving it was 
sentenced Wednesday to 18 months in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Samuel Filippo, 42, had pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud 
stemming from the telemarketing operation, which defrauded an estimated 4,000 
people throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz said Filippo promised customers that they could 
win title to a new $1,000 motorcycle just by driving it, filling out a 
marketing questionnaire and mailing in $348 for shipping and promotional 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the prosecutor told U.S. District Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez, 
three-fourths of those who mailed in the money got nothing; the remainder got 
"a cruddy moped" that was worth about $140. 
</P>
<P>
A co-defendant, Robert James Matthews, 40, of North Hollywood, has pleaded not 
guilty to 17 counts of mail fraud.

ODYSSEY OF A SKINHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
GREGORY WITHROW REVERED RACIST LIFE UNTIL HE LEARNED TRUTHS ABOUT HATE AND LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gregory Withrow, founder of the Aryan Youth Movement and reformed neo-Nazi 
thug, was standing in a Wilshire Boulevard high-rise, surrounded by Jews in 
suits. Elaborate tattoos were visible through his navy-blue tank shirt; his 
burnt-orange hair was uncombed. 
</P>
<P>
All morning long as he was interviewed in the offices of the Anti-Defamation 
League, he kept scratching the wounds on his back, where swastika tattoos had 
been burned off with laser and chemicals two months ago in a surgery arranged 
by the ADL. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Time Confidant 
</P>
<P>
Withrow is a Nazi turncoat, a one-time confidant of the nation's most prominent 
hate mongers, who took a dark and painful trek to the other side. Bandages 
remain on his shoulders, but the scars, like Withrow himself, have begun 
healing. 
</P>
<P>
The latest step in that process came last week with the first of several 
planned appearances the former racist from Sacramento has promised the ADL 
he'll make in this, his new-found role: warning teen-agers away from the hate 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, Withrow had told a crowd of 100 at the Jewish Community 
Center about the costs of his defection, which peaked with his crucifixion by 
skinhead comrades he had led until two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up to fear you," he began, then offered them an insider's view 
of the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance, the skinhead and other 
anti-Semitic hate groups, some of which preach what he once preached: "complete 
and total extermination of all nonwhites from the face of the American 
continent." 
</P>
<P>
The 45-minute discussion ended in a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
"We want him to be an advocate, and he's an eloquent one, a forceful one," said 
Jerry Shapiro of the ADL's Los Angeles office, which paid Withrow's travel 
expenses, a $100 honorarium for his talk and the cost of a night's lodging. "He 
seems to have a real rapport with kids." 
</P>
<P>
"It scared me," Withrow said later, stroking his droopy mustache. "A man who 
fears begins to hate, and so it was like facing my greatest fear. I've never 
spoken to a group of Jews. But afterwards they gave me a standing applause. . . 
. I would do it again just for the hugs." 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1961 in Sacramento, Gregory Steven Withrow said he never had much 
choice in the path he would follow. Before he was old enough to read, he 
remembers there were always anti-Semitic books on the shelves of his family 
home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruler of the Roost 
</P>
<P>
"The books I remember seeing at a very early age. A lot of little things that 
went on around the house," Withrow said Thursday as he chatted before catching 
a flight to San Francisco. "I was 6 1/2, maybe 7 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Six-feet-four and domineering, Albert Withrow ruled the roost. His mother 
"really had very little to say about things," Withrow said. 
</P>
<P>
He will say virtually nothing about his mother, with whom he has only recently 
begun building a new relationship. She is his influence now. 
</P>
<P>
But his father -- an auto mechanic who became a bartender and professional 
gambler -- shaped most of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He had a personality so "powerful" that it squelched other viewpoints. Though 
his dad worked for a time with radical conservative groups, the elder Withrow 
never bought in on the KKK, his son said. "He saw the Klan as cliche, as 
something that would never really make a difference; too ceremonial. Almost 
bourgeois, in his view." 
</P>
<P>
His father, nevertheless, raised him "to lead the white race," Withrow said. 
"Some fathers raise their kids to be doctors, lawyers or ballerinas. I was 
raised to be sort of a 'Fuhrer.' " 
</P>
<P>
By 1979, Withrow -- at 5-feet-6 and 130 pounds -- was a member of the White 
Aryan Resistance known as WAR, the KKK, the Skinheads and the American Nazi 
Party. When he enrolled the same year at Sacramento's American River College, 
Withrow formed the White Student Union, which stuffed hundreds of fliers in 
high-school lockers in California and other states claiming that the Holocaust 
was grossly exaggerated by Jews who had enough money to rewrite history. 
</P>
<P>
His adviser at the time, both men have said, was Tom Metzger -- a Fallbrook 
television repairman, leader of the White American Political Assn. and the 
White Aryan Resistance, a former San Diego congressional candidate and a former 
California Grand Dragon of the KKK. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Post Office Box 
</P>
<P>
Metzger, who hosts a cable television show, "Race and Reason," offered 
financial support and encouragement. While there was no official link between 
the groups, WAR and Withrow's White Student Union shared a Fallbrook post 
office box. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hirschhaut, executive director of the central Pacific region of the 
Anti-Defamation League, said the discrimination-fighting group has followed 
Withrow's activities since 1979, when he founded the White Students Union. In 
his role as the union's leader, Withrow was a key recruiter of new membership 
in what later became the Aryan Youth Movement, which Hirschhaut called "the 
stepchild of WAR." 
</P>
<P>
The association between Withrow and Metzger, considered by many experts to be 
the only "older" white supremacist willing to recruit and work with skinheads, 
has been documented on videotape, Hirschhaut said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a great deal of dealings with Tom Metzger -- close and frequent 
communication," Hirschhaut added. "Metzger looked upon him as a key organizer 
and rising star in the WAR movement, and there was severe embarrassment when he 
dropped out of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boozing and Drugging 
</P>
<P>
Withrow said he also organized the Sacramento Area Skinheads, which he calls 
Sash. They did their share of boozing and drugging, kicking and stomping, which 
was dubbed "docking" after the name of the steel-toe, combat-style boots called 
Doc Martins. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the events he participated in then are so despicable that Withrow 
will no longer talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Did he ever kill anyone? "No." 
</P>
<P>
Did he hurt anyone? "Yes." Several people, he says, his head hanging low, fair 
and freckled hands reaching for his mustache again. "It's not like I kept a 
toll." 
</P>
<P>
Were any of his victims permanently injured? "No. Everyone heals." 
</P>
<P>
His gang of skins -- young men who hated anybody but white Christians and had a 
taste for random and vicious attacks on the outnumbered and defenseless -- used 
to "bash Japanese tourists" then rob them in San Francisco's Tenderloin 
district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Attraction 
</P>
<P>
The skinheads' weapons of choice, he said, are "personals" -- items including 
their combat boots, knives, straight-edge razors, baseball bats and "anything 
that allows you to get up close and personal while you are hurting or torturing 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
In time, Withrow said, he earned a criminal record -- brandishing a gun on a 
police officer, assault with a deadly weapon and being a felon in possession of 
a firearm. Records show he was arrested 23 times in 14 years in Sacramento 
County alone for those felonies as well as misdemeanor crimes like assault and 
battery, drug possession and drunk driving. He did jail time at the Rio 
Cosumnes Correctional Facility in Elk Grove, officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
That only slowed his activities in the hate movement, which culminated in July, 
1986, at a national gathering of white supremacist leaders in Idaho, Withrow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly an extremist within an extreme movement, Withrow, as founder of the 
White Student Union, urged about 400 racists at the National Aryan Congress to 
pursue the "total genocide" of all non-Anglos "across the North American 
continent." 
</P>
<P>
He said he received a standing ovation from the crowd, which shouted, "Sieg, 
Heil!" and other Nazi slogans. 
</P>
<P>
Later the same month, however, Withrow's father died of cancer and alcoholism, 
and it would be his son's last summer of hate. 
</P>
<P>
Withrow had fallen in love with a co-worker at a Sacramento card club, a 
waitress named Sylvia. She was an older woman whose rejection of white 
supremacist notions had already begun eroding his devotion to the only guiding 
principle he had known since he was a kindergartner. His love for her was now 
squeezing out everything else. 
</P>
<P>
"I cared less and less about the racist movement, and I was getting bothered by 
other racists and gang members who were calling me and bugging me about 
responsibilities I was letting go on," Withrow said. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia, whose whereabouts are a mystery but whose name remains tattooed on 
Withrow's biceps, introduced him to his first Christmas, the notion of giving 
gifts, visiting the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the following summer, Albert Withrow died. While viewing his father's 
body in the hospital, Withrow said he had an epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
"I honored my father; when he died it hurt. But there was also a sense of 
relief. I was actually kind of feeling for the first time," Withrow said, his 
voice breaking. "I didn't know what to do for a long while without him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had this thought that, 'Gee, maybe I don't have to carry this on anymore,' " 
Withrow said. "Then I thought, 'No, no, no, it's my duty. I must carry on my 
duty. Honor my family, my ancestors, my race, my nation!' I just kept 
forgetting to honor myself." 
</P>
<P>
The internal struggle continued until, finally, Withrow said, he traveled south 
to Fallbrook and visited Metzger at his home. 
</P>
<P>
Told of his interest in dropping out of the hate movement, Withrow said, 
Metzger was furious. 
</P>
<P>
His son, John Metzger, also a white supremacist, appeared with Withrow in 
September, 1987, on the Phil Donahue show. There, Metzger told him he deserved 
to die for deserting his cause, Withrow claims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declined Comment 
</P>
<P>
Tom Metzger did not return phone calls to discuss Withrow. John Metzger, 
reached at the family's Fallbrook home, also declined to comment on Withrow, 
saying only, "We aren't satisfied with your newspaper and some of the articles 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
Tired of badgering from colleagues in the white supremacist front, Withrow 
said, he made his retirement from racism public, denouncing the hate movement 
on local television shows aired in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 8, 1987, one show, "Good Morning Bay Area," featured Withrow quitting 
racism for love. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Withrow said, a group of skinheads, including his best friend, 
ambushed Withrow outside Nashville West, the Sacramento club where he worked 
and partied. 
</P>
<P>
He said they drove nails through his palms, leaving him hammered, 
crucifixion-style, to an 8-foot-wide board. They slashed his throat with a 
razor and left him near a dumpster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Sidewalk 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Sharon Telles said deputies 
summoned to the Nashville West on Auburn Boulevard found Withrow about 11:30 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
"He was lying out front, tied to this thing," she said, as she referred to the 
police incident report. "We found him lying on the sidewalk in front of this 
bar he was known to frequent. There was a superficial laceration to the neck, 
both arms were out to his side, his left wrist was tied, and both hands had 
been nailed palm up to the board. And (responding officers) described them as 
No. 8 sinker-type nails." 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics cut off the nails and rushed Withrow to a hospital but he refused to 
identify his attackers or cooperate with investigators, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
With no witnesses and no help from Withrow, authorities said they had no choice 
but to abandon the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Withrow said he never will identify his assailants because doing so might 
endanger his best friend, whom he calls Dutch and no longer sees. 
</P>
<P>
Of those times, Withrow said, "It hurts me even to talk about it now." 
</P>
<P>
But talk he will, whether he feels like it some days or not. Withrow is torn 
between wanting to leave his past behind him and feeling responsible for 
warning young people about the dangers of hate. Rehashing the things he did is 
visibly excruciating to him. Sometimes he just bolts out of a room, or hangs up 
the phone mid-interview. 
</P>
<P>
Like a cancer, the most frightening and rapidly growing element in the national 
white supremacist front is that of the skinhead, both the ADL and Withrow say. 
</P>
<P>
Withrow, who said he is unemployed and receives state assistance because the 
crucifixion-style attack left his hands virtually useless, is working for a 
consultant to law-enforcement agencies battling racist gangs. He estimates 
there are fewer than 16,000 white supremacists nationally, including 1,500 to 
2,000 Nazis and 3,000 to 5,000 skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skinheads Arrested 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, a handful of suspected skinheads were arrested in two 
different Southern California attacks. 
</P>
<P>
In Laverne, an Iranian couple was attacked outside a market by a woman and 
three men who wore short-cropped hair. They allegedly shouted racial epithets 
about their being Jewish. The man was kicked to the ground; the woman, carrying 
a week-old infant, also was struck. A black man who came to their rescue was 
assaulted before officers arrived and arrested the suspects. The foursome had 
racist group membership cards in their possession and were bound for a truck 
carrying baseball bats at the time of their arrests, police said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a young man dressed like a neo-Nazi skinhead was arrested for 
allegedly defacing a Costa Mesa elementary school classroom with swastikas. 
Police said the suspect stole $40 that was used to teach second-graders how to 
count, and took food supplies from earthquake emergency kits. It was not 
difficult to nab the vandal, officers said. He photographed himself with a 
Polaroid camera in the classroom, then left the picture in a student's desk. 
</P>
<P>
Why do such people seem so threatening and why does Withrow plan to speak at 
schools statewide, spreading a message of caution to some of the same students 
he tried to reach with hate fliers years ago? 
</P>
<P>
"Because it is not the quantity but the quality of their violence," Withrow 
said. "It's not like their members are a bunch of bitter, decrepit old bigots. 
They are young people throwing their entire futures into something that is 
empty, instead of the last gasps of some old burned-out guy. They are the 
future generations of tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Although the attack outside the Sacramento bar left him frightened and living a 
transient existence, flopping at this hotel or that one around the state, 
Withrow -- who once took many drugs but now said he has been "clean" since 
September -- has found a great deal of joy in just plain existing without hate. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see people toss their lives away for something that's really not 
worth it."

AFTER A YEAR AT COLLEGE, THE SHOCK OF HOMECOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE M. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheryl and John Meshack have noticed changes in their 18-year-old daughter's 
attitude. "Bold would be a good word to describe it," Cheryl Meshack said with 
a giggle. "It's like one day she told me, 'I just have to get an ID to go out 
dancing at the clubs. Everyone has one, you know.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Meshacks aren't the only parents who have been through some changes with 
their college-aged offspring. The freshman blues are hitting hard and fast in 
Southern California, as young adults, who just months ago bid wrenching, teary 
goodbys and headed off to college, now are returning for that first, long 
summer back home. 
</P>
<P>
And in what has become a seasonal domestic ritual -- or battle, in some cases 
-- parents and collegians alike are having difficulty readjusting. 
</P>
<P>
"College gave me the right to make my own decisions and spend my money the way 
I saw fit," LaJohn Meshack explains, adding that her transition from Howard 
University in Washington to home again was rough from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm never living here again," she teases. "My parents are really getting on my 
nerves! It's always 'What time are you getting home? When do you start work? 
Clean up your room! Do your chores!' " 
</P>
<P>
Tom Martin, 19, from San Diego State University, has had a similar experience, 
he says, adding: "It's like I can't let my clothes sit around my room anymore. 
My parents are always nagging me to pick them up and clean my room." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Reeves, an 18-year-old Yale University freshman, said he wasn't back a 
week before his parents began to discuss his summer plans. "They said if I 
don't get a job, I get to paint the house." 
</P>
<P>
He's been with paint brush and ladder ever since. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Emily, jokes about the return home of her son, the last of four 
children to leave the nest. "There have been some definite changes around the 
house," she says. "When (Bill) left, the milk kept getting sour. I had to learn 
how to buy fewer groceries. Now we keep running out of milk and I have to 
remember to buy more. It's been some getting used to." 
</P>
<P>
The Meshacks, a family of five, say their house is active even when LaJohn is 
in school. "The traffic just picks up when she gets back," says her father, 
John. "You have to get used to other people being in your house, the phone 
being used more, the phone bill going up. I go to my bedroom and try to get 
away from it all. But at times, it's just no use." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Cheryl complains that "it's those music videos" that drive her up the 
wall. "You come home from work and you're tired and this hot gust of wind in 
the form of loud music meets you at the door. You'd think they are all deaf or 
something!" 
</P>
<P>
To find more harmony in their reunited households, both parents and returning 
collegians simply need to relax, advises Jerome Karasic, a clinical associate 
professor of psychiatry at the University of Southern California. He describes 
confrontations between students and parents as "human nature" at work. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for young people, college age, to get away from their 
parents," he says. "It's a natural transition. The young adult needs to fulfill 
his or her own life." When young adults find themselves cast back into their 
homes with their former, adolescent restrictions, they can, he says, strive too 
hard to hold onto their independence. 
</P>
<P>
That can be a pain, some parents complain, saying they feel their youngsters 
fail to see their point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"He feels that I am prying a little more than I should," Emily Reeves says of 
her son. "I said it was because he was my last child . . . and he says that's 
no excuse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting Up for Kids 
</P>
<P>
Mother Meshack observes: "You've got to wait up for these kids. While they are 
out having a good time, they forget you're worried sick about them. 
</P>
<P>
"Why," she says of her daughter, "I remember one time she went out with a group 
of her friends. She said she'd be back at 1:30 (a.m.). Instead, she calls at 
1:30 to tell me that they are going to get in her girlfriend's Jacuzzi. I told 
her she'd better Jacuzzi herself home."

Mother Reeves sees how problems develop, explaining: "You have no rules when 
you are a freshman in college. When you come home, you have all sorts of rules 
to live by. I can understand the difficulty in adjusting." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, the oldest of three children, says his parents question him about his 
activities, "but not in the nagging sense. One night I came home late, and the 
next morning they asked me where I had been. I know they didn't know what time 
I came in. They were just concerned." 
</P>
<P>
To ease tensions, "families need to really sit and talk" about life at school 
versus home, says Marianne Ross, a licensed psychologist and coordinator of 
clinical services at the University of California at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Curfew Hours 
</P>
<P>
Karasic recommends that parents "let the kids make their own hours. It's 
important to let them regulate their own lives." But he adds "that means taking 
on responsibilities of adulthood. The parent must say, 'You can arrange your 
life as an independent person, but in the manner that I can respect you as an 
adult.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reeves says he is allowed to set his own curfew. The problem? "It's just that I 
have to stick to it." 
</P>
<P>
LaJohn admits, "I didn't consider my parents strict before I left for college. 
I guess they are still the same. I'm the one who changed, and I shouldn't blame 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Home has changed for LaJohn. The room she lived in most of her life now is a 
younger brother's lair. "Sometimes, I feel like a guest," she says. "But I 
think that's a part of growing up. You know you have three months before you go 
again. You always know you'll be leaving again." 
</P>
<P>
Temporary inconveniences aside, parents see positive changes accompanying their 
children's new sense of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's father, Chuck, observes of his son: "I think he's a little more 
appreciative of home when he's here -- you know, the home-cooked meals, the 
laundry, family life. I think he's starting to realize that everything is not 
easy out there in the big world." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Meshack proudly recounts the day she sat with her daughter in church and 
LaJohn told her, "You know, Mom, I really understand why you do some of the 
things you do. I guess I'm pretty lucky to have a mom like you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hate Being Simon Legree 
</P>
<P>
"That was really nice to hear because you hate always being Simon Legree," she 
said. "But, I know when she hits 30, she will really appreciate these things." 
</P>
<P>
Emily Reeves says she appreciates that her son's year in New Haven, Conn., 
seems to have seasoned his sense of humor, which he displayed when they were 
stopped at an intersection near their home and a young driver ran a stop sign, 
swerved in front of their car and just missed hitting them. 
</P>
<P>
"I joked, 'He must be a college freshmen returning home,' " Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
"Naw," her son replied. "A college freshmen would never drive like that."

ELIMINATING THE DANGERS OF BACK-YARD POOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Hauling out the patio chairs, cranking up the barbecue and getting the swimming 
pool ready for summer? Remember, the same pool that provides your family with 
refreshing dips on hot days also can be a back-yard danger for children if you 
haven't followed safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"A swimming pool is a tremendous risk for a child -- it's a silent accident, a 
silent issue," said Billie Weiss, of the Los Angeles County Health Department, 
who has been working on a study of drownings and near-drownings in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Small children -- under age 5 -- are most at risk for swimming pool accidents 
and should be under constant supervision. When it comes to safety, nothing, of 
course, quite matches supervision of swimmers, whatever their age. 
</P>
<P>
But owners also should put up proper barriers to make pool areas safer. And 
though there's no way to totally child-proof a pool or spa, health 
professionals and consumer safety advocates recommend that you: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ensure there's proper fencing, at least 4-feet high, preferably 5-feet 
high, on all sides of the pool. Don't forget to see that there is only a 2-inch 
clearance between the bottom of the fence and the ground and that no vertical 
opening in the fence is more than 4 inches wide. With chain link fences, be 
sure the diamond-shaped openings are 1x1-inch so children cannot get a toehold 
and climb over the fence. And be sure that the fence permits a clear view of 
the pool from your house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Secure all fences with self-closing access gates and self-latching devices 
at least 56 inches from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep all doors leading from house to pool locked routinely; install locks 
on those doors at least 5 feet above the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remove that cover completely when the pool is in use. Swimmers, young or 
old, can get trapped under a partially extended cover, as the U.S. Consumer 
Product Safety Commission has often warned in alerts it has issued to owners of 
solar pool covers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Put away access steps if you have an above-ground pool and it is not in 
use. 
</P>
<P>
In case an accident does occur, be sure you have proper lifesaving equipment -- 
such as a pole or ring -- at poolside; be sure, too, that someone in your 
household knows first aid techniques like CPR or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
It's also a good idea to keep a telephone on or near your patio with emergency 
numbers listed next to it. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 350 children under age 5 drowned in swimming pools nationwide; 
another 4,000 youngsters had to be hospitalized after near-drownings, according 
to the National Spa and Pool Institute in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yearly Increases 
</P>
<P>
Records show the national total of drownings and near-drownings of children 
under age 5 has increased every year since the mid-1980s. And California is no 
exception. In 1985, 103 Calfornia children drowned in pools and spas; in 1986, 
there were 123 fatalities; in 1987, there were 140. State statistics are not 
yet available for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles County alone in 1988, there were 95 pool-related deaths, 23 
of them involving children 4-years-old and younger. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Health Department study that Weiss has been working on 
shows that from June, 1988, to May, 1989, among all age groups there were 226 
water-injury-related reports -- 38 of them fatalities, 188 near-drownings. Of 
the 226 incidents, almost 80% of the instances were in swimming pools; 118 of 
them involved children up to age 4. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles County, the leading cause of death between ages 1 and 4 is 
drowning," Weiss said. "Children this age in California have a higher risk of 
drowning in a pool than dying in an auto accident." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where one child drowned and two others suffered brain-damage 
after falling in a swimming pool at a North Tustin home on March 30, recent 
statistics also are chilling. There were 15 emergency medical service calls 
(EMS) in March just for near-drownings involving children under age 5, said 
Dollie Brill of Newport Beach, president of the National Drowning Prevention 
Network, which has memberships in 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15 Injuries Per 100,000 
</P>
<P>
"There are 100,000 residential swimming pools in Orange County -- and that's 
substantially underestimated. With 15 EMS calls, then that's an injury rate of 
15 per 100,000," Brill said during a telephone interview. "If that was any 
other product, mayonnaise, for instance, it would be banned from the market." 
</P>
<P>
Brill -- who co-chairs Protect Our Kids, a drowning prevention program for 
children run by the Orange County Trauma Society -- is closer to the pool 
safety issue than many who study it. Her daughter, Cassy, then 15 months old, 
was the victim of a pool accident a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She spent 36 hours unconscious and unresponsive, then she woke up," Brill 
recalled. "We were very, very lucky. She's fine, is a gifted student and an 
excellent athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"But," she added, "so many of those children who nearly drown end up 
brain-damaged." With improved emergency medical response, "we're decreasing the 
fatalities, but ending up with more brain-damaged children; 1 out of 5 ends up 
with brain damage." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to get an accurate count of the number of residential swimming pools 
in the United States but the spa and pool institute estimates there are 6.5 
million residential pools and spas in the nation's back yards. California 
industry analysts estimate that there are about 300,000 swimming pools in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties alone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No National Codes 
</P>
<P>
There are no national codes calling for barriers around swimming pools and 
spas. Those codes mostly are left to states and municipalities. Los Angeles 
city and county, and Orange County, have pool fencing codes. The consumer 
safety commission is working on a proposal for a residential pool barrier code 
and hopes that state and local governments, building code groups and consumers 
will adopt its recommendations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of effective residential swimming pool barriers is believed to be one 
of the very best ways available at this time to reduce deaths and serious 
injuries sustained by children under 5," the commission has reported. "A 
barrier is vital to the safety of children since parents cannot be expected to 
keep children in their line of sight 100% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Commission researchers report that "the typical child drowning victim is a boy 
between 1 and 3 years of age who is not thought by parents and caretakers to be 
in the pool or spa area . . . In the time it takes to answer a phone call, the 
child, if left alone, could be in great danger." National safety statistics 
also show that 65% of the drownings and near drownings of small children happen 
in a pool owned by the child's family. 
</P>
<P>
Some safety experts suggest a pool alarm can give added protection against a 
pool accident but they stress that any such device should be used in addition 
to proper barriers. Pool alarms on the market now range in price from $115 to 
$300. 
</P>
<P>
But the safety commission, which tested four popular brands of alarms in 1987, 
decided not to recommend any of them to pool owners, commenting that the 
devices, "although they generally performed in accordance with the 
manufacturers' literature" had "significant problems with false alarms and/or 
failure to alarm" during tests. "For this reason, the commission staff does not 
consider the existing devices as capable of providing completely reliable 
warnings." 
</P>
<P>
The report added that "users of pool alarms need to be aware of the limitations 
of the devices so that they are not overly relied upon for safety."

'ORPHEUS' DIRECTOR RISES TO THE OCCASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tap-dancing Mercury runs on stage to announce the arrival of Orpheus' wife, 
Eurydice. 
</P>
<P>
"Euro-dyke," he says brightly. 
</P>
<P>
"You-rid-ah-see!" thunder back the assembled gods. 
</P>
<P>
Well, whose tongue hasn't tripped up over all those Italian or French or 
foreign words? 
</P>
<P>
So Mercury, tenor Michael Smith, looks only momentarily nonplussed and soon 
floats up into the attitude pose made famous in Giovanni da Bologna's statue -- 
and on FTD delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, comedian Dom DeLuise has been strapping himself into the hulking 
apparatus in which he will be wheeled in as Public Opinion in Offenbach's 
"Orpheus in the Underworld," which opens Wednesday (through July 2) at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Director Peter Mark Schifter has been observing all the details during a 
rehearsal by the Los Angeles Music Center Opera company at a downtown theater. 
Afterwards, over assorted dishes of Indian specialties, the 39-year-old 
director waxes exuberant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a fantastic visual production," he says. "It's filled with fantasy: 
people flying through the air, houses that transform themselves into other 
things, dancing flowers and bumblebees. 
</P>
<P>
"The opera opens, in fact, with a 'pollination' ballet," he adds with a warped 
smile. "Actually, I'd say (the production) is a naughty, bawdy, 19th-Century 
comedy." 
</P>
<P>
The mispronunciation of Eurydice's name is just one joke introduced in the 
translation by Snoo Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's more than just a translation," Schifter says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real adaptation, as it needs to be. I don't think that a literal 
translation of 'Orpheus' would reach an audience today. So Snoo has really done 
a wicked and funny adaptation that satirizes Victorian sexual morality. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a wonderful writer and a very funny man -- very entertaining and weird," 
he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
A satire of Victorian morality in 1989? 
</P>
<P>
"I think sexual hypocrisy is a tradition that knows no limits of time and 
place," Schifter says. "As long as there is a . . . Jim and Tammy Bakker, and 
as long as there is a Jimmy Swaggart, then there's sexual hypocrisy, all kinds 
of hypocrisy." 
</P>
<P>
"Orpheus" is a $1.5-million co-production between the English National Opera 
and the Houston Grand Opera. Schifter was brought in by HGO to represent 
American interests, he said, to keep it from "becoming too Britty a panto 
(pantomime) or something." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until the production moved to Houston, where Schifter has 
directed Verdi's "Falstaff," Bernstein's "A Quiet Place" and Mozart's 
"Abduction From the Seraglio," that Schifter really got his hands on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've rewritten the ending. I've rewritten the beginning of the show. I've 
rewritten the middle," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sharper, it's more American musical comedy. It's a very different staging 
than it was in London. 
</P>
<P>
"The major change . . . is the role that Dom DeLuise plays, Public Opinion. I 
won't tell you the surprise ending (co-written with Wilson). All I'll say is 
that he turns out not to be who you think he was. And it was needed because the 
character that Dom plays had no payoff at the end of the show at that point. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously in selecting him for the role -- Dom DeLuise portraying the role of 
the arbiter of morality and good taste -- of course means that the audience 
will be prepared for anything, because when you think of Dom DeLuise, you don't 
think of Victorian morality. So it's a great sham." 
</P>
<P>
In design, "Orpheus" bears the striking imprint of British illustrator and 
political cartoonist ("Punch," "London Times") Gerald Scarfe. "This production 
is extremely visually rife, shall we say," Schifter says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Scarfe has a unique vision and brought his diabolical wit and satanic high to 
this project." 
</P>
<P>
Scarfe's designs have been criticized for overshadowing the singers, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Every scene Gerald designed was extremely filled with business," Schifter 
says. "There were thousands of things to look at, and sometimes it was very 
distracting to the theatrical event. When we did the show in America, we 
started simplifying it visually, so it would also play. 
</P>
<P>
"There are (still) moments when the scenery takes over, but there are obviously 
other moments when the theatrical event itself has to take center aisle -- I 
mean the story, the actors, the music. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't ignored the musical values. We've tried to accompany them with a 
visual counterpoint. Generally, there is something always going on. This is 
busier than most (productions), I would say." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Ohio University and the Yale School of Drama (he was thrown out 
of the Juilliard School of Drama, he says, "for not being able to act very 
well"), Schifter describes himself "as a sort of innovative traditionalist." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Houston Grand Opera, he has worked with Seattle and Long Beach 
operas and directed on Broadway. This year he was nominated for a Tony Award 
for the musical "Welcome to the Club." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'm very traditional," he says. "Sometimes I'm wildly innovative. It 
depends on the needs of the particular piece. So many people come up with wild 
ideas that never really hook up with the inner, real inner meaning of the work, 
that aren't really resonant but just clever. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to be a little more thoughtful about whether this is illuminating the 
piece or whether it's illuminating my career. I like to think it's illuminating 
the work.' 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to never do a production that is tedious or boring," he says.

AIDS DISCRIMINATION BAN REJECTED IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote before a tense and emotional crowd, the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday rejected a proposed ordinance that would ban 
discrimination against AIDS victims, making Orange County the only urban area 
in California without such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
The vote capped an 18-month study by the county's HIV Advisory Committee that 
concluded the ordinance was necessary to reduce the spread of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome by making its victims more likely to seek treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which would prohibit discrimination against people with AIDS in 
the areas of housing, employment or county services, was also endorsed by the 
county's health officer and the Health Care Agency. Supporters of the measure 
left the meeting disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the pressure from the squeaky wheels overcame common sense and 
sanity," said Pearl Jemison-Smith, chairwoman of the advisory committee. "We 
are behind in Orange County. Here, AIDS is a four-letter word." 
</P>
<P>
The opposition was led by Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's Anaheim-based Traditional 
Values Coalition, which mailed more than 1,000 letters to its members urging 
that they show up for Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 people attended the session, including the vocal anti-homosexual 
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and the acknowledged homosexual Laguna 
Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry. The supervisors heard nearly three hours of 
sometimes sobbing and strident testimony from a total of 36 speakers -- 21 
against the ordinance -- before they voted as insiders had predicted on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I support the fears and concerns of those opposed to the ordinance -- it is a 
fear of the unknown," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who joined Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley in supporting the measure. "(But) I'm concerned about the 
spread of the disease. I'm concerned about ignorance spreading the disease." 
</P>
<P>
All three of the supervisors voting against the ordinance -- Gaddi H. Vasquez, 
Don R. Roth and Roger R. Stanton -- said they believe that existing state and 
federal laws already protect AIDS victims from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I have tasted discrimination, and it is a very bitter taste," Vasquez told the 
audience. "This is not a matter of whether you are for or against 
discrimination. I am concerned about the duplicity of laws." 
</P>
<P>
Roth added: "My record is very clear as a public official -- that is, I oppose 
discrimination. But in good conscience, I cannot give favor to one group over 
another." 
</P>
<P>
Politically, it was a sensitive issue for a board that is composed of five 
conservative Republicans and almost always casts unanimous votes. Some 
supporters of the issue attributed the vote to the strength of right-wing 
politics in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said: "You and I both know . . . Orange County is certainly more 
conservative" than other urban counties. "I think being conservative, it's a 
little more difficult perhaps to (vote with) a more open . . . sense of 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said after the vote: "It's kind of unfortunate that Orange County has to 
always be the recalcitrant. It's only substantiating an image of Orange County 
that really has been changing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Urban Status, . . . Problems" 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that we'd grown up, that we'd achieved urban status with urban 
problems and we'd recognize this thing (differently)." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, who recently announced her bid for reelection, said she hopes that her 
vote will not hurt her politically. "I would hope that my constituency would 
have faith in my integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Don Hagan, a representative on the HIV Advisory Committee from the Orange 
County Medical Assn., said: "Two or three of the votes came out of fear of a 
very vocal religious minority. I think the vocal response from the religious 
right is very loud in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hagan and Smith said that after 18 months of work, the advisory 
committee will not give up its goal of an anti-discrimination ordinance for 
people with AIDS. They said they will talk with the opposing supervisors about 
the possibility of supporting another version of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possibility of New Vote 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez seemed to leave open such a possibility when he said shortly before his 
vote that he cannot support the measure "in its present form." Vasquez was not 
specific about what changes he considers necessary. And afterward, he said that 
the possibility of changing his vote is "slight." 
</P>
<P>
"I will be glad to listen to the committee without making any commitments," he 
said. "I don't think there is much difference in the concerns we all have about 
the AIDS crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the ordinance would have prohibited discrimination against people 
with AIDS or those "perceived" to carry the AIDS virus in the areas of housing, 
employment or county services. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance said that an employer may not fire or decline to hire a person 
because he or she has AIDS, that a landowner cannot terminate a housing 
agreement or change a property transaction because a person carries AIDS and 
that people with AIDS will have complete access to all public county services. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to encourage persons to fully utilize such (health care) services so 
that this condition can be diagnosed and treated and the risk of transmission 
to others can be reduced, it is necessary that discrimination against persons 
with AIDS or AIDS-related conditions be clearly prohibited," the ordinance 
reads. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it had been passed by the supervisors, the ordinance would only have 
applied to the unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
In preparing the proposed ordinance, the county's advisory committee reviewed 
similar measures that have been adopted in California's five largest counties, 
excluding Orange. They are Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Riverside and 
Alameda. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors adopted their ordinance in February, on a 3-2 
vote when Supervisor Deane Dana broke with his two Republican colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gay Life Style Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Much of Tuesday's testimony from opponents of the ordinance linked AIDS with 
homosexual behavior and criticized the gay life style. 
</P>
<P>
"I demand that you take a stand to protect us from this onslaught that would 
try to destroy the church . . . and try to pervert the rest of us," said Steve 
Goodyear, who called himself a father and an "extremely concerned citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Another speaker, who said she represents the Concerned Women for America, said: 
"It seems to us that this is a form of reverse discrimination. The rights of 
the few have superseded the rights of the majority. We believe we are facing a 
severe threat to our population and its institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer suggested that this type of ordinance would have far-reaching 
ramifications, such as the possibility that doctors would not be able to wear 
masks and gloves when they treat AIDS patients, that insurance carriers would 
not be able to distinguish the greater health risks for those with AIDS and 
that blood banks could be forced to accept contaminated blood. 
</P>
<P>
"If we grant this ordinance, someone will say you must accept my blood into the 
blood supply of this country," Dannemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Adrian Kuyper corrected Dannemeyer's statement, however, 
repeating that the ordinance is limited to discrimination in employment, 
housing and county services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Church Support Cited 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in favor of the ordinance, retired Rev. John M. Krumm of St. Paul's 
Episcopal Church in Tustin said he has discussed AIDS with religious leaders 
throughout Southern California and found support for the measure from the Roman 
Catholic bishops of California, the Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, the 
Methodist bishop of Southern California and the Presbyterian Church in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"For me and many others in our society, the traditional values that are 
important in this present health care crisis are compassion and care, healing 
and help," Krumm said. 
</P>
<P>
"If this ordinance is defeated, the vast majority of religiously affiliated 
people of this county and this state will want to know why Orange County . . . 
is not willing to give this assistance to the health agencies as they seek to 
conquer . . . this disease." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gentry, who interrupted his testimony when he was overcome by emotion in 
discussing the AIDS death of his live-in partner, said Laguna Beach has already 
adopted an anti-discrimination ordinance for people with AIDS that has been 
helpful to businesses and residents. 
</P>
<P>
"In our community, when someone is ill, we don't subject them to 
discrimination," he said. "The virus is -- yes -- dangerous. The fear is more 
dangerous."

DANNEMEYER UNVEILS SCHOOL-PRAYER MEASURE 
</P>

<P>
The way William E. Dannemeyer sees it, God ought to have a reserved seat in the 
nation's public schools. This week in Congress, he will take the first step in 
an intensified effort to set that seat aside. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) on Thursday plans to introduce in the House of 
Representatives a "Community Life Amendment," a constitutional amendment that 
would allow states and communities to legalize voluntary school prayer and 
instruction in the Judeo-Christian ethic, including the Ten Commandments and 
the Bible's version of creation. 
</P>
<P>
"America now serves at the altar of man," Dannemeyer said in remarks prepared 
for delivery Thursday. He said the philosophy of humanism, setting man above 
the Creator, "has kicked the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob . . . out of our 
nation's school system." 
</P>
<P>
At best, congressional staff members say, the odds against passage of 
Dannemeyer's amendment are tremendous. Even if approved by the required 
two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress, the measure would have to be 
ratified by 38 of the 50 state legislatures to become law. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer, however, is undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
"The American public overwhelmingly 
</P>
<P>
wants this thing to happen," he said in an interview, citing polls that he said 
have shown that two-thirds of Americans support voluntary prayer in schools. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he is not ultimately successful, the six-term conservative hopes to 
focus new attention on an issue whose time, he insists, is coming. He said he 
hopes to take advantage of an arcane House rule to get his controversial 
measure to the House floor without running the gantlet of a hostile 
subcommittee. Once there, Dannemeyer aides said, they would attempt to rouse 
public support and sway members feeling pressure from hometown constituents. 
</P>
<P>
If he gets that far, Dannemeyer for the first time would confront Congress 
directly with the explosive issue of teaching the biblical doctrine of creation 
in public schools, said a lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
No such measure has yet made it to the floor of either house for a vote, and 
most lawmakers would clearly prefer to avoid the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This literally rewrites the First Amendment to the Constitution," said Barry 
W. Lynn, legislative counsel in the ACLU's Washington office. The First 
Amendment bars Congress from making "any law respecting an establishment of 
religion" or infringing on the right to free speech, a free press and peaceful 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1962, the Supreme Court has, in a series of decisions, interpreted the 
First Amendment as barring various forms of prayer in public schools. Two years 
ago, the high court held unconstitutional a state law requiring public schools 
to teach the biblical doctrine of creation along with scientific theories of 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU national spokeswoman Colleen O'Connor on Tuesday referred to Dannemeyer's 
constitutional initiative as "an overt attempt to try to Christianize the 
school system." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn added: "I think that some of this effort . . . serves as a way to put 
people on record" in Congress to make them targets of public pressure. However, 
he said, "I think it is one that can be defeated." 
</P>
<P>
The four-paragraph amendment begins: "The right of the people to allow 
voluntary school prayer and the teaching of the Judeo-Christian ethic in public 
schools shall not be denied or abridged by the United States." 
</P>
<P>
It then says the definition of the "Judeo-Christian ethic" shall include "the 
Ten Commandments, and the creation of the earth as accepted in the 
Judeo-Christian tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer's press secretary, Paul Mero, said the amendment meets a key test of 
a 1963 Supreme Court decision in that it has a "secular" or non-religious 
purpose. In this case, Mero said, that purpose is to teach youngsters basic 
American values embodied in the Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the second paragraph of the Declaration, which says that all men "are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are 
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mero: "We can't very well come out and tell the kids they have unalienable 
rights if we are unwilling to say there is a Creator, to acknowledge that 
fact." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer wants to prevent the House Judiciary Committee from referring his 
amendment to the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, which is 
dominated by Democrats who have opposed previous Dannemeyer initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Employing a rarely used House rule, the congressman hopes to persuade a 
majority of the full Judiciary Committee to sign a letter calling for 
consideration of the measure at that level. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer is staking his hopes on the fact that 20 members of the 35-member 
Judiciary Committee last month voted for a voluntary prayer-related amendment 
tacked on to a vocational education funding bill. The amendment, which passed 
the House 269 to 135, marked the first House vote on school prayer since 1984. 
The complete bill is still under congressional consideration. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lynn of the ACLU and others, including several congressional staffers, 
said the constitutional amendment is much more ambitious and potentially 
far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
The vocational education amendment, one staff member said, "was an easy one to 
vote yes for. I'm sure a lot of members said, 'I'll vote yes, but the courts 
will save us' " by ruling the measure unconstitutional.

POLICE STING NETS SUSPECTS IN CIGARETTE, LIQUOR THEFTS 
</P>

Fullerton police have arrested a San Clemente liquor store owner and another 
man after the owner agreed to buy stolen cigarettes and alcohol from undercover 
officers, and a search of his store and home netted $70,000 worth of stolen 
merchandise, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Police Sgt. Joe Klein said the owner of the Catalina Market, Austim 
Saba, 31, and Awni Shubair, 52, both of San Clemente, were taken to Fullerton 
Jail after their arrest Monday night but released after posting $10,000 bond 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Saba denied Tuesday that he was dealing in stolen goods and criticized police 
for their handling of the sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of stolen cigarettes and alcohol is becoming big business on the black 
market, Klein said, usually with small store owners buying the merchandise from 
people who accumulate large quantities of the items stolen from store shelves. 
Some are sold by people who have stolen small quantities of liquor or 
cigarettes, but most are sold by thieves who deal in bulk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"These two items -- cigarettes and booze -- are one of the hottest items on the 
black market today," Klein said. "Most of your burglars and thieves seek these 
because they know they can turn them over quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking small-time shoplifters, we're talking about entire 
truckloads of merchandise, carfuls of cigarettes," he said. "We're talking 
about large-scale theft." 
</P>
<P>
He said store owners buy the cigarettes and alcohol for about a quarter of the 
retail value, then resell them for full value. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Sgt. Jim Flammini, who headed a crime task force that launched 
what is believed to be the largest stolen property sting operation in the 
county in March, said such black-market trade in cigarettes and alcohol is very 
common. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not unique, retail outlets dealing in stolen cigarettes and liquor," 
Flammini said. "If there are large quantities involved, small stores will buy 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said Monday's arrests resulted from an undercover operation by the 
Fullerton Police Department's burglary unit that began two month ago with the 
arrest in Fullerton of "low-level people involved in this ring." 
</P>
<P>
"Our burglary unit received information that a group of people involved in 
burglaries of supermarkets were selling cigarettes and alcohol to liquor 
stores," Klein said. "They identified the Catalina Market in San Clemente as 
one of the biggest receivers." 
</P>
<P>
The undercover officers went to the Catalina Market, in the 100 block of 
Avenida Victoria, at about 11 p.m. Monday, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers went in, posing as burglars," he said. "They identified some 
property as stolen, and they made the sale to the liquor store owner. They 
(Saba and Shubair) were arrested for receiving stolen property, and a search of 
the business and the home resulted in the recovery of $70,000 in stolen booze 
and cigarettes from major stores in California, much of it with market tags 
still on them." 
</P>
<P>
Saba, whose store was open for business Tuesday, denied that he was dealing in 
stolen merchandise. "No, I wasn't doing something like that. . . . No. No, it 
never happened that way," he said of the police description of Monday night's 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"I was closing (the store). . . . I thought it was a holdup. They came in in 
plainclothes. They showed no . . . badges. I said, 'Oh, God, we've got a 
holdup.' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's very fair," he said about the sting operation and his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they learned through their own undercover work and other information 
that Shubair is an employee at the store. But Saba said Shubair is actually a 
banker from New York who, like himself, was wrongfully accused. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a guest coming to visit," Saba said. "He has never been employed here. 
He never worked for me." 
</P>
<P>
Saba complained that the officers had neither an arrest warrant nor a search 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said, however, that because the officers witnessed the crime, no arrest 
warrant was necessary. And because Saba consented to a search of his business 
and home, a search warrant also was not legally required, the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who said he was head of the narcotics unit for eight years, said theft 
of cigarettes and alcohol for black-market resale is common among drug addicts 
because it is a fast way to pay for their habit. 
</P>
<P>
"In the extreme cases (of addiction), most addicts are unable to maintain 
themselves through routine jobs and obviously turn to crime. A vast majority 
turn to shoplifting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the merchandise is stolen by small-time shoplifters, the bulk of 
it comes from people who steal large quantities off delivery trucks, Klein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is being done all over Southern California by many people and it drives 
the prices up. And it's consumers who have to pay for the losses," he said.

LETTERS OF GRIEF POUR IN FOR PARENTS IN DAY-CARE TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The letters spill across a desk in Will Johnson's mortgage loan office in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Postmarked from all over Southern California, they have nothing to do with home 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they describe the shock and sorrow other parents felt after learning 
that two small children had died Thursday in a Huntington Beach fire. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all I have to my name right now," wrote a woman from Tustin who sent 
$23. "Nothing can bring Jessica (Jordan) back, but maybe it will help out a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
A woman from Pacific Palisades said: "I cannot express the grief I feel. I have 
an 8-month-old daughter, and I held her as I cried watching the news." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and his wife, Laurie, have been running the Huntington Beach Fire 
Victims' Fund for families of those who died or were injured in the blaze. And, 
the couple said Tuesday, they have been greatly moved by the response. 
</P>
<P>
The fund has so far received more than $2,000 to help cover medical or funeral 
expenses, mostly in $10 and $20 donations, but some larger. Customers at the 
beauty salon where one victim's grandmother works sent $30. The Huntington 
Beach Fireman's Assn. contributed $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
As generous as the donations have been, the Johnsons said they were not 
expecting the letters that accompanied them -- at least 60 so far, many of them 
inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been part of the healing process for everyone in the office to read some 
of these," Laurie Johnson said. "For all the world's sorrow and tragedy, people 
can be wonderful. And I have a feeling this is just the beginning. I think more 
will be coming in all week." 
</P>
<P>
Will Johnson established the fund last week after learning that employee Susan 
Jordan's daughter, 8-month-old Jessica, died in the fire at a licensed family 
day care in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Also killed was 13-month-old John Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica is to be buried at 3 p.m. today in Good Shepherd Cemetery in Huntington 
Beach, according to a funeral home spokesman. A requiem Mass is to be said for 
John at 10 a.m. today at St. Bonaventure Church, 16400 Springdale St., 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, day-care operator Pat Orozco, who ran from her burning home with a 
child under each arm, was reported in good condition Tuesday at Long Beach 
Memorial Medical Center with second-degree burns on her arms and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Six-month-old Nick Duncan was reported in serious condition at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange with second- and third-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, deputy city attorneys in Huntington Beach began drafting an 
ordinance that would require every day-care provider to install a smoke 
detector in each room. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to get this done by Friday and to the council Monday," 
deputy City Atty. Joe Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves it as an emergency ordinance, with five votes, the 
measure would become effective immediately, Barron said; otherwise, the 
ordinance would take up to 45 days to take effect, if approved. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco's three-bedroom home was not equipped with a smoke detector, but state 
codes conflict on whether these are required. State day-care licensing 
requirements allow providers to use either smoke detectors or fire 
extinguishers. However, the state building code requires family day-care 
providers to have both fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach fire investigator Tom Huntley said Tuesday he has concluded 
his investigation. The blaze was started by a child playing with either a 
cigarette lighter or matches, he said. Then a chair caught fire, as did nearby 
reading material. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges will be filed, Huntley said, because the person who started 
the fire is a minor and "below the age of knowing right from wrong." 
</P>
<P>
To assist victims of the fire, write to Huntington Beach Fire Victims' Fund, 
c/o Mortgage Network, 2400 E. Katella Ave., Suite 1040, Anaheim, Calif. 92806.

PEOPLE /HERBERT J. VIDA: PHYSICIAN PRACTICES WHAT SHE PREACHES: ORGANIC 
GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Carrie Teasdale follows a time-honored gardening tradition: She doesn't 
plant vegetables until blue jays and other migratory birds come home. 
</P>
<P>
"That gives me the signal," said Teasdale, 40, president of the newly formed 
California Organic Club, which is based in Fullerton and has 90 members. What's 
more, the vegetables and fruit she grows by that method may have cured her 
allergies, Teasdale said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have allergies anymore," said the semi-retired Fullerton 
family-practice physician who plants and cares for her own organic garden. 
"Organic food supposedly had something to do with that, but I can't attribute 
it just to organic foods." 
</P>
<P>
She also has her own method for dealing with bugs that invade her back-yard 
garden patch, which includes lettuce, herbs, squash, onions, garlic, tomatoes 
and 14 fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought some hens because they do most of the work, and they like to eat 
bugs," said Teasdale, adding that her chickens also lay blue, green, pink and 
white speckled eggs. "It's like Easter here every day." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the fun she has in her organic garden, as well as helping others 
with organic garden plots, Teasdale bragged that "you can't buy food of the 
quality I eat from my garden. People who grow up on supermarket food don't 
realize what real food tastes like." 
</P>
<P>
She likes to point out that a plant not grown organically is not as strong as 
those that are. "It's not as healthy if you have to use pesticides or 
chemicals," she said. "And if it's not as healthy, it will not be as tasty or 
nutritious." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said, "organically grown food has a longer keeping quality in a 
refrigerator." 
</P>
<P>
Although she's ready to talk about the merits of food grown in organic gardens, 
Teasdale said she doesn't want to denigrate farmers or their methods, but 
rather "to show people who are back-yard farmers how to grow their own food." 
</P>
<P>
That, she added, can make people more self-sufficient and provide them with a 
lifelong healthy hobby working with nature in the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much interested in the ecological system and working with nature 
because nature does it better," she said. "You can find that out by going out 
and picking food right off trees. There's just no way you can get the same 
flavor and aroma in a supermarket." 
</P>
<P>
To exhibit their work, club members set up a 30-by-30-foot garden area at the 
Fullerton Arboretum where they planted fruit trees and gourmet and Oriental 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"We're learning through experimentation," said Teasdale, adding that all the 
food they grow will be free of pesticides. "People of today are much more 
concerned about what food they are putting in their mouths. When they go to a 
market that advertises there is no detectable level of pesticide in their food, 
it doesn't mean it isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
But she said people who grow organic food know for sure their food is pesticide 
free. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Sherman of San Clemente won the first prize of a $500 scholarship in a 
Capistrano by the Sea Hospital art show entitled "Pageant of Upcoming Masters."

<P>
GRAND JURY BACKS PLAN FOR NEW FORENSIC LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury has recommended that county officials consider a 
proposal by a private company to build a seven-story building in Santa Ana to 
permanently house the Sheriff's Department forensic science unit. 
</P>
<P>
The forensic unit, which analyzes and tests evidence gathered at crime scenes, 
now operates out of two separate buildings in the Civic Center, a costly and 
inefficient arrangement, the grand jury said. To consolidate operations and 
provide more space for the Sheriff's Department crime lab, the grand jury 
recommended that the Board of Supervisors consider a plan by Hutton Development 
Co. to build a new forensic facility on the southwest corner of Flower Street 
and Santa Ana Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The company has proposed building twin, seven-story buildings on the 3.4-acre 
site, along with a 1,200-space parking garage. One of the towers could be built 
to county specifications for the forensics unit. It would then be leased to the 
county. Officials estimate that the cost of a new forensics lab would be about 
$25 million. Earlier this year, county officials rated the Hutton proposal the 
best among five plans to relocate and consolidate the crime lab at a single 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a critical need for more space," said Jodeane Harrod, chairwoman of 
the grand jury's criminal justice committee. "Without new and expanded 
facilities, we increasingly run the risk of jeopardizing critical evidence 
needed in criminal investigations." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are expected to consider the Hutton proposal next month.

IRVINE COUNCIL CALLS FOR SURVEY OF VOTERS ON CITY TOLLWAY ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine voters will be asked whether the city should continue to help plan -- 
and soon foot the bill for -- the future San Joaquin Hills tollway and two 
other proposed county toll roads, the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the state Supreme Court ruled that the issue could not be submitted 
to voters for a binding decision. Tuesday's council action gets around that 
ruling by making the election -- with mail-in ballots sent to nearly 60,000 
registered voters in the city -- advisory only. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran, however, said he will follow the advice of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I will treat it as binding on my part," said Agran, who noted that he could 
not speak for the other four council members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1985 Initiative Drive 
</P>
<P>
The survey carries out the spirit of a 1985 initiative drive by a group called 
the Committee of Seven Thousand, which collected 7,000 signatures for a 
"citizen's right to vote" initiative that would have required voter approval of 
fees to help pay for the proposed San Joaquin Hills, Eastern and Foothill 
corridor projects. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine is a member of a joint-powers authority that is planning the 
$556-million San Joaquin Hills Corridor, which would run from the Costa Mesa 
Freeway southeast to Interstate 5 near San Juan Capistrano. Irvine will be 
responsible for 25% of that cost, which would be paid with developer fees 
collected by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also involved in planning and paying for the proposed Foothill 
Corridor, which would run along the county's eastern foothills and connect 
Rancho Santa Margarita with central Orange County, and the proposed Eastern 
Corridor, an inland north-south toll road linking the Riverside Freeway with 
the Irvine area. 
</P>
<P>
The mail-in ballots will be sent to residents in August. The survey will cost 
the city $58,540, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin Hills Corridor agency is expected to vote on the bond sale in 
September. If Irvine is then still a member, the city would be committed to 
remain in the agency for 15 years to help pay off the bonds. That timing 
precludes the City Council from putting the issue before voters on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Material sent to voters will also include information about the highways and 
arguments pro and con. 
</P>
<P>
When Irvine became a member of the planning agency, the City Council majority 
was more in favor of development than now. The currently majority favors slower 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group in 1985 criticized the highway plan, citing environmental 
concerns, and quickly collected enough signatures to put it on the ballot. The 
initiative, however, was challenged in court by the Building Industry Assn. of 
Southern California and other business and transportation groups. The challenge 
was ultimately heard by the state Supreme Court, which ruled that the highway 
project was of statewide importance and thus not subject to local initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Agran, who had sided with the Committee of Seven Thousand's initiative, said 
Tuesday that he favors approval of the San Joaquin Hills Corridor project.

FINISH DISAPPOINTS ABDUL-JABBAR, BUT HE'S NOT SAD HIS TIME RAN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And so it ended . . . 
</P>
<P>
After 20 seasons and 1,815 National Basketball Assn. games, counting the 
regular season, playoffs and All-Star appearances, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came out 
for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen seconds remained in the final game of the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
The fans stood and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons stood and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar showed little expression. He kept his goggles on. After a while, 
he nodded his head and said, "Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to enjoy the moment and take it all in and receive the crowd," he 
said later. "I gave my teammates one last hug. That's the last time I'll be 
able to do it on the hardwood." 
</P>
<P>
Play resumed and time ran out. Game, series, season and career. 
</P>
<P>
Thus did Abdul-Jabbar pass into basketball history, after 20 NBA seasons, four 
more than anyone has ever lasted, and 37,639 regular-season points -- 44,149 
altogether -- and most of the important records in the game. Love him, hate 
him, don't give a damn about him, but where he walked, no one will soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 42, he passes over into civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
How will he begin it? 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know," he said. "Probably sleep 'til 1 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
His passing was awkward. The Pistons, who'd played him with one man and watched 
him go for 24 points and 13 rebounds Sunday, paid him the compliment of 
double-teaming him, as in days of yore. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar sagged to seven points and three rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
He tried six last skyhooks -- five actually, with one impromptu jump hook 
thrown in -- and missed them all. 
</P>
<P>
He took down only three rebounds. Late in the game, with the Lakers still 
within 100-96, he couldn't react fast enough to pick up Joe Dumars' miss one 
step away and John Salley got it, instead. Moments later, Dumars knocked in a 
17-footer, effectively putting the game on ice. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, someone suggested, Kareem would have preferred to have it end after Game 
3? 
</P>
<P>
"No," said Abdul-Jabbar. "I wish it was Game 5, 6 or 7. Like I said, I just 
wish we could have lasted longer. The other numbers are unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed. I'm not sad. We knew we were going uphill, without our best 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to wonder about it (how a healthy Laker team would have fared). I 
already have wondered about it. But I can't dwell on it. That's the way the 
hand was dealt." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, what did he have to complain about? 
</P>
<P>
He had a long, distinguished professional career. 
</P>
<P>
He got his wish, to be traded back to Los Angeles, where he'd gone to college. 
</P>
<P>
He was already a 10-year veteran when the Lakers picked up Magic Johnson to go 
with him, kicking off a run of five titles and three more trips to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't have been any better," Abdul-Jabbar said. "Not when I can remember 
growing up on the streets of Manhattan and hoping I got to play one pro season. 
I outlasted everybody. I got to play with the greats of the game." 
</P>
<P>
How did he think he'd done? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I did pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
How did retirement feel? Perhaps with a surging crowd of people bearing pens, 
tape recorders, minicams and sound booms bearing down on him, he didn't feel so 
retired quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hasn't set in, as far as deeper meanings," he said. "I'm just 
thankful I've been able to last this long and walk out the door. I thank the 
Almighty for that. After that . . . we'll see what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of days ago, Abdul-Jabbar said he wouldn't get involved in basketball 
in another capacity, that he had had enough competition for a while. 
</P>
<P>
How about working with kids? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, my kids," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got some things in the fire," he said Tuesday night. "I'm going to try to 
do some acting . . . I have four little people I have to find out what they're 
doing, get more involved in their lives. I think it'll keep me pretty busy." 
</P>
<P>
It was about then that Magic Johnson brought one of his sisters through the 
media melee to kiss Kareem goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you work with a guy whose whole objective is to get you the ball, you 
gotta love him," Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
Did he plan to say anything to Johnson about the passing of the torch. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic knows what to do with it," said former Laker great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

THE SANTA MARGARITA BONANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, Santa Margarita High is going to be the most powerful, most dominant force 
in Orange County high school athletics. At least that's what most athletic 
officials from other county schools are saying. 
</P>
<P>
Part of their fear is stoked by the sight of the $26 million campus, complete 
with a few crystal chandeliers, a computer hookup for every student and a cable 
television station. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact is that only 500 students, all freshmen and sophomores, attended 
the school this past year, its second in existence. It has yet to win a 
Southern Section or state title, or even a varsity league championship. 
</P>
<P>
So for the record, The Times, as a prep service, would like to clear up some 
misconceptions regarding Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are a number of expensive cars parked in the school lot. 
</P>
<P>
No, valet parking is not available. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the school is planning to build a football stadium in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
No, it will not include luxury boxes or the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, athletic contests are broadcast on the school's cable television channel. 
</P>
<P>
No, the school has not signed a contract with ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Santa Margarita has a full complement of teams. 
</P>
<P>
No, it does not yet have a league to play in. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the school's teams have some very nice uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
No, they were not designed by Calvin Klein. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Santa Margarita has a magnificent gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
No, it will not play host to the Final Four in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the school has a cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
No, students do not have to call ahead for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there is a baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
No, it doesn't have Diamond Vision.

BILL BROWN NAMED CENTURY FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Brown, former varsity football coach at Brea-Olinda High School, has been 
named football coach at Century High in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 48, compiled a 32-25-3 record in six seasons at Brea, leading the 
Wildcats to three playoff appearances in the Central Conference. He took a 
leave of absence in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't have too much interest in the job until I started talking to 
the people over there," Brown said. "I was impressed with the quality of people 
at the school and feeling of cooperation they all wanted. They not only want a 
good academic program, they also want top-notch athletic programs." 
</P>
<P>
Brown was defensive coordinator for three years at Brea-Olinda before becoming 
coach in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, an Indiana State graduate, also has been coach at John Glenn High in 
Norwalk, where he was 13-13-1 in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was selected after school administrators opened the position for a second 
time. Mike Churchill, former Riverside Poly coach, originally was selected, but 
Churchill later rejected the job and accepted a varsity position at Redlands 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Century is scheduled to open in the fall with 1,000 freshmen and sophomores. 
Brown becomes the third high-profile coach to join the new school's athletic 
department, joining Greg Coombs (basketball) and Rick Hayes (baseball).

SWITCHING RACES IN MID-STRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he started training for his final high school track and field season last 
winter, Doug Nichols focused most of his thoughts and energies on one event: 
the 400-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
Little did he know that a different event, the 800 meters, loomed in his near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know I was going to run the 800," said Nichols, an Edison senior. 
"But my coach (Stan Stauble) knew. He planned on it. He was training me for it 
all along." 
</P>
<P>
The differences between the 400 and 800, runners say, go much further than the 
difference in distance. The 400 could be described as a one-lap race of all-out 
strength and speed. The 800 is more tactical, and, many times, runners benefit 
more from strategy than speed or endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the transition between the two can take weeks, even months before 
the runner feels comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
In early spring, Stauble, who also coached Edison freshman Shelley Taylor to a 
whirlwind season this year, asked Nichols to run an 800 in practice. Nichols 
did, and ran impressively for his first try, finishing in 2 minutes 1 second. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, he made his competitive 800 debut at the Beach Cities 
Invitational, lining up against a quality field that included Corona del Mar's 
Eddie Lavelle. 
</P>
<P>
After out-kicking Lavelle in the final stretch, Nichols won in 1:55.9, just a 
half-second off the meet record. 
</P>
<P>
A week later at the Arcadia Invitational, Nichols placed fourth among a 
national-class field in 1:53.93. 
</P>
<P>
And a week after that, Nichols ran a 1:52.54 to place third behind Canadian 
Mike McLean and Mexico's Arturo Espejel at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays. 
His time was the fastest in California at that point, and the third best in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
But the best performance for Nichols, who has been selected boys' track and 
field athlete of the year by The Times, came at the Masters meet. 
</P>
<P>
Running with his right shoe untied and flopping off his foot, Nichols placed 
second in a lifetime-best 1:51.94, the 13th-fastest time in county history. 
</P>
<P>
And less than 40 minutes later, he ran a lifetime best split of 47.9 in 
anchoring the Chargers' 1,600-meter relay to fourth-place victory in 3:16.92, a 
school record. 
</P>
<P>
Although his season ended with a minor disappointment -- he was fifth in the 
state meet in 1:53.94 -- Nichols said he is pleased with the way the season 
went. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it turned out pretty well, a lot better than I expected, really," 
Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I didn't think I would (run the 800), I liked it the whole time. . 
. . I learned a lot. The race itself, it's fast enough that you don't get too 
tired, but long enough that you have time to think about what you're doing."

KNOTT'S BERRY FARM PLANS TO OPEN A CAMP SNOOPY IN A $600-MILLION ENCLOSED 
SHOPPING MALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, it had to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Two of America's most popular institutions have finally gotten together -- 
shopping malls and theme parks. And they're doing it in a major way. 
</P>
<P>
The largest enclosed shopping mall in the United States will be mated with 
Knott's Camp Snoopy, the nation's largest enclosed theme park. The $600-million 
project, called Mall of America, will total 4.2 million square feet -- about 
the size of 78 football fields -- when its first phase opens in the fall of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
The project, in Bloomington, Minn., represents the first outside venture for 
Knott's Berry Farm, the privately owned theme park in Buena Park. If 
successful, Camp Snoopy could become the first of several similar projects 
across America for Knott's. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Snoopy also marks the first major combination of entertainment and retail 
concepts in this country -- a show-biz approach that many developers believe 
represents the new generation of malls. 
</P>
<P>
"You're really changing the shopping center into a community center," said Bill 
Dawson, president of Resort Parks International, a Los Angeles-based leisure 
development firm. "It's fulfilling the needs of the consumer. And the more 
needs you fulfill, the longer people stay." And shop. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to fulfilling needs, Mall of America has everything but an 
undertaker. The project -- which plans a ground-breaking ceremony today for 
Flag Day -- will have eight anchor stores, up to 800 shops, a health club, 100 
restaurants and nightclubs, an ice rink and miniature golf, 18 theaters and, of 
course, Camp Snoopy. To really browse its corridors will take about three days, 
according to the Ghermezians, four reclusive Iranian-born brothers who own the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Phase One alone totals 2.8 million square feet in gross leasable space. (Gross 
leasable area includes shops, storage, food courts and Camp Snoopy, but not 
non-leasable space such as corridors and parking lots.) 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the nation's largest mall now is Del Amo Fashion Plaza in 
Torrance, with 2.65 million square feet of gross leasable area. South Coast 
Plaza in Costa Mesa, ranks No. 2, with almost 300 stores in 2.6 million square 
feet, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
The miles of aisles in Mall of America's Phase One total roughly two-thirds of 
what is on the drawing boards. Long-term plans make the complex sound more like 
a city than a mall. The project's two major developers -- Melvin Simon &amp; 
Associates and the Ghermezians' Triple Five of Minnesota Inc., based in 
Edmonton, Canada -- have approval to add up to 5.3 million square feet, 
including three high-rise hotels, office space and residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
When it is completed, Mall of America will be second in size only to the West 
Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, a 5.2-million-square-foot Ghermezian extrava ganza 
said to be the largest enclosed shopping center in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Sales at the 8-year-old mall are a very impressive $300 per square foot, 
according to executives with Melvin Simon. But at the shopping center trade 
group's recent conference, the Edmonton Mall got poor reviews from developers 
who say it does not seem to draw hordes of customers and caters mostly to 
people buying middle-of-the-road, lower-priced merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7-Acre Theme Park 
</P>
<P>
But things will be different in Minnesota, Simon executives say. For one thing, 
Mall of America is expected to serve bag-toting shoppers from a surrounding 
community of 4 million. That's four times the population base of West Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Another big difference is Camp Snoopy, which will be located on two floors in 
the center of the mall. The seven-acre theme park will include 16 of the most 
popular attractions at Knott's Berry Farm -- all presided over by an eight-foot 
look-alike of the famous beagle on top of a 60-foot fountain.

Knott's $70-million "entertainment component" will be the first major theme 
park built inside a retail center. Others -- such as the behemoth West Edmonton 
Mall -- have amusement parks, but they were added in stages, giving a 
scrambled, hodgepodge effect. 
</P>
<P>
While it's still too early to project revenue, Knott's is betting that it can't 
lose. After all, "you're putting something into a facility that is going to 
deliver 40 million people to your front door every single year," said Stuart 
Zanville, Knott's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's and the mall developers hope that the marriage will bring together the 
best of both shopping malls and theme parks: crowds and money. The strategy 
seems to have worked at similar projects. 
</P>
<P>
At the Woodbine Center north of Toronto, adding a one-acre indoor children's 
park with 11 rides brought about 15% in additional sales, said Hermann Kircher, 
president of Larry Smith &amp; Associates, Toronto-based marketing research 
consultants who did studies for Mall of America. 
</P>
<P>
At the West Edmonton Mall, features such as Ferris wheels, a huge aquarium and 
a church have boosted sales 35% to 40% above what they would be if there were 
no razzle-dazzle in the retail, according to Nadir Ghermezian, managing 
director of Triple 5 Corp. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that by adding flashy rides and shows, malls lure customers from 
hundreds of miles -- compared to an ordinary mall that attracts shoppers from 
say, up to 10 miles away, Ghermezian said. And once in the mall, entertainment 
goes a long way toward keeping customers there up to two times longer, some 
retail experts say. 
</P>
<P>
What mall theme parks won't guarantee is that people who will pay to play are 
also the ones who will plunk down money for a Givenchy gown. "It's the repeat 
customer who uses the entertainment facility. And that customer doesn't 
(necessarily) spend much" on high-priced, high-profit apparel, said Kircher, 
the consultant. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, Mall of America should have sales averaging more than 
$400 per square foot in its first year, Nadir Ghermezian said. That number is 
more than double the national average of $166.26 and probably overly 
optimistic, according to industry experts. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Mall of America can reach -- let alone sustain -- those numbers remains 
a serious question. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is longevity. What happens after the carrousel gets old?" said 
Dawson of Resort Parks International. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker Corp., the Australian retailer and developer, is wondering the same 
thing. In March, Hooker opened the 1.8 million-square-foot Forest Fair Mall in 
Cincinnati, which includes 100,000 square feet of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Splashy features like a miniature golf course, batting cages and bumper cars 
have been "very successful," said Greg Glass, president of the Atlanta, 
Ga.-based, LJ Hooker Developments division. "Entertainment in malls is here to 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Glass acknowledged that Hooker Corp. would consider selling Forest 
Fair for the right offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is how to keep giving the customers what they want," Glass added. 
"People in this country are very fickle, and what's hot today isn't hot 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
So will today's entertainment satisfy tomorrow's shoppers? "I think the jury's 
still out," Glass said.

U.S. NAMES 5 FIRMS TO RECEIVE GRANTS FOR HIGH-DEFINITION TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the first move by the federal government to support U.S. firms trying to 
catch up with the Japanese and Europeans in high-definition television, a 
Pentagon agency Tuesday picked five firms to receive government funds to 
develop better display technologies. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is planning to 
spend a total of $30 million over the next three years on HDTV, named two 
Silicon Valley firms -- Newco of San Jose and Menlo Park-based Raychem. It also 
named Texas Instruments in Dallas, Projectavision of New York and Photonics 
Technology of Northwood, Ohio. The amounts of the awards will be subject to 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said it could not predict how many other contractors might receive 
federal grants as well. 
</P>
<P>
But DARPA, which has long played a role in funding U.S. industrial research 
projects, did not name the best-known proposal from a joint venture between 
Zenith, the last remaining U.S.-based television manufacturer, and AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith and AT&amp;T said they would continue their work even if they did not 
receive government funds. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, responding to intense interest in HDTV 
from members of Congress, has promised to present a federal plan to support 
U.S. development of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Resolution Screen Is Key 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for HDTV said the choices highlight the need for Congress to boost 
Pentagon funding for HDTV to $100 million a year to provide help for a larger 
number of projects. DARPA received 87 applications for its high-definition 
television program, which was announced last December, and said earlier this 
year that 49 proposals were worthy of support. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's primary goal is developing a high-resolution screen that can 
display text, characters or video signals with great clarity to be used inside 
new helicopters and airplanes, training simulators, computer-aided design and 
on other military applications. 
</P>
<P>
The department also hopes that by providing money for new research, it can help 
U.S. electronic and semiconductor companies forge ahead in developing the next 
generation of TV sets for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
High-definition television, which is expected to hit the market sometime in the 
next decade, offers the promise of bringing movie-quality images and 
crystal-clear sound to the home. 
</P>
<P>
A Raychem official, in a telephone interview, said the DARPA selections appear 
aimed at those firms working on newer display technologies rather than at ones 
focusing on improving the traditional cathode ray tubes used in today's TV 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have the lead in CRTs," said Paul Cook, a Raychem executive. 
"We're trying to leap past them." 
</P>
<P>
Raychem is working with Xerox Corp. on a process to combine its liquid crystal 
technology with thin film transistors developed at Xerox's Palo Alto Research 
Center on a flat panel display, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Newco has told the Pentagon that it is working with Spectra Physics as a 
subcontractor. Newco officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments, which is by far the largest of the firms selected, plans to 
combine its efforts with the David Sarnoff Research Center, which is run by SRI 
International and has developed a number of HDTV projects. 
</P>
<P>
Projectavision and Photonics Technology did not identify any partners.

UNITED TO START LOW-FARE FLIGHTS BETWEEN ONTARIO AND OAKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Airlines said Tuesday that it will begin service from the Ontario 
airport in San Bernardino County to Oakland on July 5 with special introductory 
fares that will be the lowest implemented since major carriers began 
discounting fares in the California market about six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
However, Southwest Airlines immediately matched United's special $25 and $29 
fares. United would not disclose what its fare structure will be after the 
brief introductory period but said its fares "will remain competitive and will 
be the lowest of any carrier serving the Oakland-Ontario market." 
</P>
<P>
Southwest interprets that statement to mean that United will match its regular 
$49, unrestricted one-way fare on the Oakland-Ontario route, said David Brown, 
Southwest's chief spokesman. No other carrier so far has matched this regular 
$49 fare. 
</P>
<P>
Brown vowed, however, that Southwest will not be undersold. "For 20 years, we 
have been dedicated to having the lowest fare in any market we serve. We see no 
reason to change that business philosophy," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ontario-Oakland market "is a heavily traveled route," United spokeswoman 
Sara Dornacker said. "We would like to make some inroads into that local 
market." 
</P>
<P>
United said it will begin Oakland-Ontario service with a $25 one-way fare good 
for travel between July 5 and July 12, provided that the ticket is purchased 
between June 10 and July 4. The special fare structure also includes a $29 
one-way fare without an advance purchase requirement but good for travel only 
between July 5 and July 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Southwest Started Trend 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said the fares will be available for every seat on every flight 
during those periods. Southwest said it will match those fares in every detail. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest, a small Dallas-based carrier, is credited by some with starting this 
spring's widespread discounting in the California market. 
</P>
<P>
It has distinguished itself from the other carriers by offering the $49 
unrestricted fare for every seat on each of its six daily nonstop 
Oakland-Ontario flights and five daily nonstops between Oakland and San Diego. 
Southwest also offers a $29 one-way, 21-day advance purchase fare for those 
routes, which has been matched by other carriers.

EVERYONE BUT KRAFT WINS AS CHEESE CONTEST GOES AWRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any way you slice it, Kraft General Foods comes out the loser in a weekend 
contest promoting cheese that inadvertently produced too many winners for a 
single grand prize. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing the printer that prepared the game pieces of botching the job, Kraft 
on Tuesday declared its "Ready to Roll" game "null and void because of an error 
in printing." 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of only a limited number of winning game pieces, essentially all of 
the game pieces appear to be winning ones," said Michael Caruso, a Kraft 
spokesman at headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Glenview. He declined to 
identify the printer. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of miffed contestants, attorney Jay E. DeGroot filed a class-action 
lawsuit Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago. "A couple of people 
called us," he said. DeGroot described the action as a breach of contract suit 
but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Caruso said the company contends that it is "not liable for any legal action 
because the contest was deceptive." Caruso said Kraft is evaluating how to 
compensate would-be winners. 
</P>
<P>
The game required entrants to match a "right-half" coupon inserted into Sunday 
newspapers in Chicago and Houston with the "left-half" coupon found inside 
specially marked packages of Kraft Singles cheese slices. 
</P>
<P>
Matched pairs were to be redeemed for whatever they depicted: one of 500 
skateboards, one of 100 bicycles, one of 8,000 free packages of cheese, or, at 
odds of 15 million to 1, a 1990 Dodge Caravan LE valued at $17,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kraft realized that the job had been bungled when, by one estimate, as 
many as 100 people in the Chicago area called claiming to have won the van. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Kraft, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., wriggles out of having to honor 
all winning entries, the company's reputation could suffer in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time something like this happens in the industry, it hurts all of us 
because it raises doubt in the consumer's mind," said Ken Fehskens, president 
of Ventura Associates, a service that runs sales promotions and contests. 
</P>
<P>
To Chicagoans, the unintentionally generous game was reminiscent of a 1986 
Beatrice Cos. promotion connected with Monday night football game scores. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Frank Maggio, a Georgia man working at the time for rival Procter 
&amp; Gamble, cracked a pattern in the contest scratch-off cards and came up 
with 4,018 winning entries worth, by his count, $16 million. When Beatrice 
refused to honor them, he sued and eventually won a settlement that has been 
estimated at several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
DeGroot's law firm, Lawrence W. Leck &amp; Associates, filed a separate 
class-action suit on behalf of 2,400 plaintiffs in that case and reportedly won 
a $2-million settlement last year.

Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., said a weakening 
in long-term Treasury bond prices acted as a catalyst for the selloff in stocks 
and encouraged investors to prune their holdings of shares on which they had 
made substantial profits in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Also motivating sellers was a desire to collect their profits before the 
government reports a string of potentially market-moving economic statistics 
later this week. Reports on merchandise trade are due Thursday. On Friday, 
reports for May on consumer prices and housing starts will be issued.

The pharmaceuticals concern Pfizer partly blamed the dollar's appreciation for 
an expected 30% to 40% decline in its second-quarter earnings. Disclosure of 
the disappointing estimate late Monday led Pfizer stock to plunge 3 1/8 to 58 
in heavy trading Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other drug companies took a cue from Pfizer, including Syntex, which slid 1 1/2 
to 50 3/4, SmithKline Beckman fell 1 1/8 to 61 3/8 and Warner Lambert tumbled 2 
3/8 to 89.

In Tokyo, stock prices fell Tuesday when investors sold on fears of a discount 
rate rise to brake the dollar's rise. The 225-share Nikkei index fell 184.46

loans, was quoted late in the day at 9.31%, up from 9.25% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
Central banks helped push the dollar lower Tuesday as the U.S. government 
reported that the deficit in its broadest measure of foreign trade worsened 
dramatically in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against all major currencies except the British pound, which 
was weakened by speculation of a rift between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
and her top economic official, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
The pound finished the European trading day at its lowest level against the 
dollar in more than two years, although action by the Bank of England and a 
statement by Thatcher supporting Lawson raised it from its lowest levels. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the pound slipped to $1.5162 late Tuesday. That was the pound's 
lowest rate against the dollar since February, 1987. Late Monday, sterling cost 
$1.5250. In New York, the pound traded at $1.5270, down from $1.5285 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 0.30 yen to a closing 148.70 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted 
at 149.15 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 147.75 yen from 148.46 yen on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.63 an ounce to close at a bid of $361.66. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $359.50 an ounce from late Monday's 
$359.95. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures prices dropped to a 10-month low Tuesday amid fears that the 
International Coffee Organization's failure to forge a new price-support pact 
could leave unroasted coffee free to fall to as low as $1 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, orange juice futures rose sharply; grains and soybeans 
advanced; petroleum futures were mixed; precious metals gained, and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures settled 4.75 cents to 9.46 cents lower on New York's Coffee, 
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery in July at $1.1538, 
the lowest close since Aug. 8. The price of coffee for July delivery in New 
York has dropped more than 11% since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of nearly 9 1/2 cents Tuesday was nearly twice as large as the decline 
posted Monday, when it became apparent the world's largest coffee producer- and 
consumer-nations would end their nine-day meeting in London without an 
agreement to replace the 6-year pact that expires Oct. 1.

FROM BEIJING TURMOIL RISES A 'HOT ITEM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The recent turmoil in China has been good for Chiang Chu's business. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Chu's Postal Plus novelty shop in Irvine started selling 100% 
cotton, Beijing University T-shirts for $12, plus shipping and handling. The 
company has already received orders for at least 200 shirts, largely because 
Chinese students' tragic attempt at democratization has gripped the world's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
The shirts -- which come in white or yellow -- feature the Chinese flag and the 
words Beijing University written in both English and Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
"People get tired of wearing a UCLA, USC T-shirt all the time," said Chu, a 
Shanghai native. "They want to wear something different." 
</P>
<P>
Chu, 39, said Tuesday that he got the idea to sell T-shirts stamped with the 
names of foreign universities several months ago but rushed the Beijing shirt 
into production when demonstrations in Beijing's Tien An Men Square became 
news. 
</P>
<P>
"It just happened at the right time," Chu said. 
</P>
<P>
Then a military assault crushed the protests and resulted in the deaths of 
hundreds, maybe thousands, of Chinese. One week later, the shirts were on sale. 
</P>
<P>
Chu said that after the Tien An Men Square tragedy, he decided to donate 
between $3 and $4 per T-shirt to a charity caring for Chinese students. Chu 
said he is still looking for an appropriate organization and is not worried 
about people who may think he is trying to capitalize on the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a very politically motivated guy," Chu said. "I'm just a businessman. 
I'm just making T-shirts, you know. However people want to view it, that's 
their problem." 
</P>
<P>
Chu said the T-shirt appeals to two types of people -- those who like its 
originality and those who want to wear it as a sign of support for Chinese 
students' struggle for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
George Hernandez of Los Angeles said he ordered six Beijing shirts to 
demonstrate his solidarity with the Chinese students' struggle for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
For eight days in September, Hernandez, 58, toured Beijing with the help of an 
interpreter, who was a Chinese college student. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will help the students over there. In my own small way, I figured 
I helped," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing University T-shirt has been such a hit that Chu is already talking 
about his next project -- the Moscow University T-shirt.

PAPER SUES AMERICAN CONTINENTAL IN BID FOR CONTROVERSIAL TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Phoenix newspaper filed suit against American Continental Corp. Tuesday, 
seeking the return of a reporter's tape-recorded interviews, which American 
claims show that federal regulators have illegally leaked confidential 
information about the company's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Gazette reporter Leslie Irwin inadvertently left the 90-minute tape 
cassette in the office of Tempe developer Conley Wolfswinkel after interviewing 
him about his loans and financial dealings with Irvine-based Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Wolfswinkel and others are wrongly keeping the paper from 
recovering its property. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfswinkel, who said Irwin left the cassette in a recorder that she had 
borrowed from him, said he listened to the tape after the June 2 interview with 
Irwin and then gave it to his lawyer and to an attorney for American 
Continental, which is based in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental executives claim the tape is evidence that federal 
regulators have been illegally leaking financial information about Irvine-based 
Lincoln to the media. Federal law prohibits government agents from disclosing 
such confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
But Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental, claims that 
S&amp;L regulators have been leaking restricted information to reporters for 
more than three years in an effort to destroy him and the company. Keating and 
regulators have feuded almost since the time his firm bought Irvine-based 
Lincoln in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection April 13 while it tries to 
reorganize its debts under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. Regulators 
seized Lincoln the next day and now operate it under a conservatorship. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Gazette's civil lawsuit, Irwin and a Gazette editor filed a 
criminal theft report Monday with the Tempe Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
A. Melvin McDonald, an American Continental attorney, said he has sent a copy 
of the tape to the U.S. Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section and 
has given the original to the FBI office in Phoenix. The Justice Department, he 
said, has opened an investigation of alleged criminal leaks of information by 
government agents. 
</P>
<P>
The tape reveals that regulators gave Irwin confidential information about 
Wolfswinkel's loans and other financial dealings with Lincoln and American 
Continental, said Tarlow and Howard L. Weitzman of Los Angeles, another lawyer 
for American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
"They told her things like how much Conley owes, what his loans were for and 
other intricate details," Tarlow said. "They're not supposed to be giving that 
information to reporters or anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman said Irwin taped one regulator saying that "Keating is a target and 
we'll keep looking for something until we get him." 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Johnson, Gazette managing editor, could not be reached Tuesday and a 
Gazette spokeswoman referred further questions to the newspaper's attorney, 
James Henderson, who declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco said officials 
there "already are trying to learn the facts behind the latest claim that this 
bank has released confidential information." 
</P>

UniCare Financial Corp., an Irvine holding company for a workers' compensation 
underwriter, may be looking for a change in ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The company recently said it has retained the investment banking firm of Smith 
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "to explore alternatives to maximize shareholder 
value." 
</P>
<P>
UniCare's president, Russell Leatherby, would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives have long thought the firm has been undervalued on Wall 
Street. Hiring an investment banker to look for ways to increase value, 
however, often indicates that a sale or management buyout is in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
Leatherby took over as president and assumed more responsibilities this year as 
the heir apparent to his father, Ralph Leatherby, the company's chairman and 
largest stockholder, with a 60% stake.

CHRISTIAN FARMERS MARKET QUIETLY CLOSES STORES IN MAINPLACE MALL AND FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christian Farmers Market in Santa Ana has abruptly closed its doors. 
</P>
<P>
The upscale, open-air grocery and food court apparently vacated the 
MainPlace/Santa Ana mall over the weekend of May 27, said Judy Bijlani, mall 
spokeswoman. "It was a complete surprise. We found out Monday morning (on May 
29) when we came in and there was nobody here," Bijlani said. 
</P>
<P>
The store's owners, Michael and Susan Christian, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who founded the Christian Farmers Market chain, evidently have also 
closed their Fullerton store. That store's phone has been disconnected and an 
employee at another Orange County site said the Fullerton site is no longer 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Farmers Market stores remain open in Laguna Hills and San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Bijlani said she had thought the Santa Ana store was "doing fine," but added, 
"evidently they had some reasons for doing something like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana store opened in October after some delays. Once in business, 
Christian Farmers Market gave a festival atmosphere to MainPlace, with its 
hanging baskets, bins brimming with quality produce, and decorative overhead 
crabs and lobsters wearing laced shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian's chain started 11 years ago in Anaheim, when the couple opened 
their first market. The original site has since closed. 
</P>
<P>
MainPlace/Santa Ana officials hope to have another market operator in the 
former Christian site within the next 90 days, Bijlani said.

Former Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, who spent part of his youth in 
China, was asked on ABC's David Brinkley television show Sunday what he thought 
was going on in China today. "The same thing that is happening throughout the 
Communist world," said Blumenthal, who is now chairman of Unisys Corp., "and 
that is really the computer revolution. Over the last 40 years, because of the 
tremendous power of that little chip, everything that we do and that the 
Communist countries have had to learn to do is governed by this new 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
People are dying and this guy's talking about semiconductors. Is he kidding? 
</P>
<P>
No. Blumenthal is making a profoundly serious point -- the same one made by 
former President Reagan on Tuesday when he declared in London that "the Goliath 
of totalitarian control will rapidly be brought down by the David of the 
microchip." 
</P>
<P>
The point is that the fax machines and computer networks made possible by 
advances in microelectronics -- which began with the transistor in 1947 -- 
undermine Communist systems, because they defeat its central planning and 
control of people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Impossible to Control' 
</P>
<P>
They do so by putting information in people's hands. On one level, 
microelectronics keeps students in China in touch with each other and with the 
70,000 Chinese students who are currently in the United States. Through fax 
machines and computer networks, they communicate information on missing 
individuals and news of families. Information may not save lives, 
unfortunately, but it does undermine the Big Lie. 
</P>
<P>
And beyond that, says Blumenthal, elaborating on the thought he expressed on 
television, "the enormous pools of information created by microelectronics are 
impossible to control from the top." 
</P>
<P>
It seems evident that there are a lot of fax machines in China. One or two fax 
machines can be controlled by secret police. Hundreds are more difficult to 
control. And if China is to progress into the modern world, there will be 
thousands of fax machines and control becomes nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately evident that the driving forces of the modern economy 
undermine political control, but they do. 
</P>
<P>
With computerized money markets, businesses gather capital everywhere, and 
local control diminishes. With computerized desktop publishing, a government 
can't so easily stop the presses. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, the Soviet Union seized a Xerox machine from a U.S. 
correspondent because he was allowing dissidents to run off their underground 
newspaper. But today, copying machines are portable, computers can be held in 
the palm of a hand and are harder to seize. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Networks 
</P>
<P>
Even the means of production can be disseminated widely instead of being 
controlled by a central source. Thanks to microchips capable of storing 
information equal to 125,000 of the letters and numerals you are now reading, 
production changes profoundly. The knowledge is in the machine, not the 
instruction manual. The precise specifications of an automobile, the dimensions 
of windows and fenders, can be put onto microcircuits that control the cutting 
of the metal and molding of the shapes. And goods can be produced anywhere 
because those specifications and instructions can be transmitted instantly over 
international networks. 
</P>
<P>
All of that is possible if you're in the network -- as China's students in the 
United States are, but China's politicians are not. "The students have been 
communicating on Bitnet," says Richard Judy, director of Soviet and Eastern 
European Studies at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis. What is Bitnet? It is 
an international computer network, powered by 1,306 mainframe computers that 
link scientists and scholars in the United States, Canada and Mexico with Earn, 
the West European network, and with AsiaNet in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Communication and trading of ideas goes on all the time on Bitnet," says Judy. 
And it is that network that Chinese students at places such as Harvard, 
Berkeley and Columbia have been able to use -- at least in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Such networks are the nerve system of the modern industrial world. But China 
itself is outside such networks, as is the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
Thus their scientists are limited, their technology several steps behind. 
Control from the center is possible, but it is control of a technologically 
backward and materially poorer society. 
</P>
<P>
It was to escape that condition that Communist societies have been trying to 
liberate their economies. But liberation isn't easy. "In order to manage a 
modern economy, you need people who are clued in," says Blumenthal. "You must 
allow students to have information." 
</P>
<P>
For over a decade, China has been sending 20,000 students a year to the United 
States. The government's problem was that it couldn't restrict what they -- or 
its own young people at home -- were learning. 
</P>
<P>
Now China wants to reverse course. But it's going to find that it cannot shut 
access to political ideas even while going forward economically. In the age of 
the microchip, you can't stop the flow of information. "Power comes out of the 
barrel of a gun," said Mao Tse Tung. But that was a long time ago, and now 
there's another kind of power coming out of fax machines and computer screens.

BUSH'S TOP S&amp;L ADVISER BLASTS THRIFTS ON CAPITAL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The President's top adviser on savings and loan issues Tuesday blasted S&amp;Ls 
that are lobbying to weaken financial standards for the industry, saying: "A 
small group of thrifts wants to make billions of dollars in loans without a 
dime backing them." 
</P>
<P>
With the House beginning debate today on the S&amp;L rescue package, Richard 
Breeden said rules regarding capital are "the key issue" and insisted that the 
White House is not retreating from the strict standards in the version of the 
bill approved by the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost, it's a question of safety," Breeden, an assistant to the 
President, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The House Banking Committee measure would require the owners of S&amp;Ls to 
furnish $3 in cash to their institution for every $100 in loans it makes, a 
safety margin designed to deter thrifts from making the kinds of risky 
investments that produced the industry's current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Restriction Now 
</P>
<P>
Some thrifts have comparatively little cash invested by their owners. Instead, 
they count as capital the value of goodwill -- the intangible worth of an 
institution in addition to its cash and physical assets. Much of this goodwill 
was obtained in recent years when healthy thrifts took over sick S&amp;Ls, 
receiving certificates of supervisory goodwill from federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Current rules provide a 3% capital standard without any restrictions on the 
amount of goodwill that can be included. The S&amp;L industry as a whole has 
about $15 billion to $18 billion in supervisory goodwill, which is now counted 
along with cash as capital. The proposed capital standards would eventually 
forbid the counting of goodwill, requiring the already hard-pressed industry to 
raise billions of dollars in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts dependent on goodwill have been lobbying Congress vigorously to be 
permitted to keep counting the value of goodwill. These institutions "have 
saved the taxpayers billions of dollars" by agreeing to acquire troubled 
S&amp;Ls during the early 1980s, said Jared Cameron, spokesman for a lobbying 
group, the Financial Assistance Inequity Relief Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had not supplied a helping hand, the troubled institutions would have 
been liquidated with taxpayers' money," Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal S&amp;L insurance fund, which guarantees deposits up to $100,000, 
did not have enough funds to close S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors, so federal 
regulators fashioned complex deals, including promissory notes and goodwill 
certificates, to attract healthy thrifts to buy ailing ones. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts that were active in these deals now say it would be unfair for the 
government to force them to give up the use of goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major S&amp;Ls dependent on goodwill -- and active in the campaign to 
modify the House Banking Committee bill -- are Talman Home Federal Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. of Illinois, Chicago; Empire Federal Savings, Buffalo, N.Y.; 
Anchor Savings Bank, New York; Merabank, Phoenix, and Seamen's Bank for 
Savings, New York. 
</P>
<P>
But Breeden, a key architect of the Administration's S&amp;L package, said 
counting goodwill as capital is financially worthless, the "equivalent of cold 
air." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the House Banking Committee bill have been fearful the White 
House is not providing sufficiently strong backing for the capital rules. But 
Breeden insisted that the Administration is fighting hard. "The President has 
spoken to members of the leadership and members of Congress, and he will 
continue to be active," Breeden said. The overwhelming majority of the nation's 
2,000 thrifts will be able to meet the new capital standards, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Tough standards are vital to prevent a recurrence of the current S&amp;L 
crisis, a "national tragedy," Breeden said. The Administration's S&amp;Ls 
package will cost an estimated $157 billion over the next 10 years, with the 
funds used to close or sell hundreds of crippled thrift institutions and pay 
off depositors. 
</P>
<P>
In other thrift news Tuesday, a survey indicated that consumers are nervous 
about the S&amp;L crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of California are experiencing the S&amp;L crisis first hand," said 
Alex Sheshunoff, president of a financial information and consulting firm. 
"Many have seen thrifts fail and, even with insurance, Californians are 
concerned about their deposits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although deposits are insured up to $100,000, about 37% of Californians 
surveyed said they worry about losing money. By contrast, a national survey 
disclosed a lesser fear factor, with 28% of Americans worried about the safety 
of their deposits, according to the poll earlier this month by Sheshunoff 
Information Services of Austin, Tex.

REAGAN NOW A KNIGHT BUT NOT A SIR; 
</P>
<P>
QUEEN BESTOWS TITLE -- NO DUBBING, NO KNEELING REQUIRED

<TEXT>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II made Ronald Reagan a knight today, but without the kneeling 
and dubbing because the knighthood is honorary for foreigners, who cannot be 
called "Sir." 
</P>
<P>
The Buckingham Palace announcement ended days of speculation about whether the 
former President, whose easy manner and conservative ardor made him a firm 
friend of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, would receive the highest honor for 
non-Britons. Honors to foreigners are recommended by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan told reporters outside the palace: "I feel greatly honored." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan emerged from lunch with the queen with a box containing the insignia of 
an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath, one of 
the highest orders of chivalry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Queen's Warning 
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth accompanied the Reagans to their car to say goodby, and 
jokingly warned Reagan: "Don't drop them." 
</P>
<P>
With his wife, Nancy, beaming beside him, he responded: "I can't say how proud 
I am to receive it." 
</P>
<P>
"Sir" is a title reserved for Britons, but at dinner parties Reagan can sit 
closer to the queen than unknighted former presidents. He also can use the 
initials "G. C. B." after his name. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans arrived Sunday for a private visit and dined with Thatcher on 
Tuesday night. They will fly to Paris on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The queen has been pleased to approve a recommendation . . . that the 
honorable Ronald Reagan be appointed an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most 
Honorable Order of the Bath," the palace announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth made the presentation after lunch in her private dining room, 
where she rarely entertains foreigners. The Reagans were the only guests of the 
monarch and her husband, Prince Philip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Kneeling 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Britons receiving knighthoods, Reagan did not have to kneel and be 
tapped on the shoulder by the royal sword. Instead, the queen handed him the 
order's insignia: a star, badge and broad ribbon of crimson silk. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan was the 57th American to receive an honorary knighthood, and the first 
since World War II to receive the Order of the Bath, which has its origins in 
knights appointed at the coronations of Saxon kings. 
</P>
<P>
The name comes from the symbolic bath taken by medieval candidates for 
knighthood. Admission to the order recognizes "conspicuous service" to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Honorary GCBs include Dwight D. Eisenhower, as the Allied supreme commander in 
World War II; Gen. George C. Marshall, as author of the Marshall Plan; Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur, and Adm. Chester Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
Caspar W. Weinberger, defense secretary in the Reagan Administration, got the 
title in February, 1988, but in the lower Order of the British Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Other American honorary knights include philanthropist John Paul Getty II, 
Henry Ford III, former Secretary of State Dean Rusk and actors Douglas 
Fairbanks Jr. and Sidney Poitier.

SANTA CLARITA AUTO BURGLARY RING BROKEN BY 5 ARRESTS, DEPUTIES SAY

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said this morning that they have broken 
an auto burglary ring with the arrests of five teen-agers who were caught 
breaking into cars in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the area of Whites Canyon Road and Stillmore Street called the 
Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday and reported that 
cars in the neighborhood were being burglarized by a group of young men, Deputy 
Van Mosley said. A short time later, deputies arrested three 17-year-old boys 
and Jim Ngo and Binh Chau, both 18, on suspicion of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
All the suspects are from the San Gabriel Valley. Information from them and 
evidence found during the arrests led deputies to obtain warrants to search the 
teen-agers' homes Tuesday evening, Mosley said. The searches were conducted in 
Monterey Park, Alhambra, La Puente and Rosemead, and deputies recovered several 
master keys for cars and a variety of stolen merchandise, including 33 car 
stereos and 18 speaker sets, Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
At a home in Monterey Park, Chau's 22-year-old brother, Alex Chau, also was 
arrested on suspicion of burglary and receiving stolen property.

John Mulheren, a high-flying stock speculator with ties to jailed financier 
Ivan Boesky, was indicted today on securities charges, the U.S. attorney's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office said he was indicted on 42 counts of securities and 
mail fraud, and conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Mulheren faces a maximum sentence of five 
years in prison and fines totaling $10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office said the violations arose from Mulheren's allegedly 
fraudulent business relationship with Boesky. Mulheren was general partner and 
chief trader of Jamie Securities, a now-defunct investment and arbitrage firm.

Federal spending on AIDS has totaled $5.5 billion since 1982, researchers said 
today in a study termed the first overall accounting of federal efforts to 
combat the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Federal AIDS expenditures will be about $2.2 billion for 1989, tripling state 
expenditures on the disease, and are expected to reach $4.3 billion in 1992, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although sizable, this will be just 1.8% of all 1992 health dollars," said the 
researchers, whose study appears in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The total spending figure of $5.5 billion includes the $2.2-billion expenditure 
expected in the current fiscal year.

Despite advertising claims suggesting safer smoke, cigarettes low in nicotine 
and carbon monoxide pose no less risk for heart attacks in women than regular 
"high-yield" cigarettes, researchers said today. 
</P>
<P>
"For smokers who want to reduce their risk, switching to low-yield brands is a 
poor alternative to quitting," warned researchers from the Boston University 
School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco industry advertisements "imply that cigarettes low in tar, nicotine and 
carbon monoxide are safer," lead researcher Julie Palmer said. "In terms of 
heart disease, that's not true."

CHINA ORDERS OUSTER OF 2 AMERICAN NEWSMEN; CRACKDOWN STORIES CITED

Authorities today ordered two American reporters expelled for their reporting 
on the martial law crackdown that crushed the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Given three days to leave were John Pomfret of the Associated Press and Voice 
of America bureau chief Alan Pessin. 
</P>
<P>
The expulsion order came as authorities intensified criticism of the United 
States and pressed on with a nationwide clampdown on dissent that has already 
netted more than 1,000 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Communist authorities have criticized VOA, whose short-wave broadcasts are an 
important source of information for Chinese, as spreading "distortions." They 
have also condemned Washington for sheltering Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and 
his wife, Li Shuxian, at the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200 Line Up for Visas 
</P>
<P>
The embassy in Beijing reopened its visa office today, and about 200 Chinese 
who want to leave the country lined up. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, warned the United States in 
a harsh front-page editorial today to "stop interfering in China's internal 
affairs and not do anything to harm bilateral relations." 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who tries . . . to put pressure on the Chinese government is not 
sensible and is shortsighted, and will gain no advantage in the end," the 
editorial said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Pomfret violated martial law regulations on reporting and had met 
with leaders of the independent student organizations that led seven weeks of 
protests for a freer China. 
</P>
<P>
"Pomfret used his journalism credentials for illegal activities and used 
illegal methods to get state secrets," the Beijing television news charged. "He 
protected the leaders of student groups and exchanged information with them." 
</P>
<P>
Pomfret, 30, has worked for the AP since 1986 and has been based in Beijing 
since 1988. He studied in China from 1980 to '82 and speaks fluent Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
"I did my job as a journalist and I worked hard," Pomfret said. "It's a shame 
that these are the results I get." 
</P>
<P>
Pessin, 33, said the Foreign Affairs Office of Beijing accused him of engaging 
in reporting aimed at distorting facts, spreading rumors and instigating 
turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
"The only motive we have is to tell the truth as best we can. Governments do 
not always like that," said Pessin. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency today issued its first detailed account of 
the assault on Beijing, saying that nearly 100 soldiers and police died and 
that thousands were wounded. It said about 100 civilians were killed and nearly 
1,000 injured. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were lower even than those given last week by a government 
spokesman, who said nearly 300 people were killed, including many soldiers. 
Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence estimates say about 3,000 people 
were killed, most of them civilians.

<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was mobbed by West German well-wishers for 
the second straight day today as he visited Stuttgart to view the high 
technology he needs to modernize the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 5,000 gathered behind barriers across from the New Castle state 
residence where Gorbachev spent more than two hours talking with political and 
industrial leaders of Baden-Wuerttemberg, one of West Germany's most prosperous 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Before his formal meetings with local leaders and a tour of a robotics and 
industrial machinery exhibit at Stuttgart University, the Kremlin leader 
mingled with the crowd and signed autographs to thunderous cheers and cries of 
"Bravo, Gorby!" 
</P>
<P>
"I like Mike," "Greetings, Gorby" and "New Thinking, No New Weapons," 
proclaimed some of the signs hoisted by well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the cheering receptions he has been accorded at all of his public 
appearances, Gorbachev said, "This has really pleased all the Soviet people." 
</P>
<P>
Inside New Castle, a reconstructed 18th-Century palace that houses two 
government ministries, Gorbachev praised Baden-Wuerttemberg Premier Lothar 
Spaeth and the people of his state for their pioneering role in joint economic 
ventures with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to note that the people of your state have been out in front," 
Gorbachev, on the third day of his West German visit, said during the brief 
welcoming ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
He said the crowds on the cobblestone square in front of the building 
personified the rapprochement between West Germany and the Soviet Union after 
years of tense relations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than feelings. This is evidence of the great changes that have 
taken place," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Spaeth praised Gorbachev's role in pressing for a "common European home" with 
more cooperation between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has worked as much as you have to make this possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Spaeth -- tapped as a possible West German chancellor -- also noted that 
Germany remains divided into two states and that the Communist East is fenced 
off by barbed wire and the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"The building site for the European House is not yet finished. There are still 
barbed wire and walls. But despite this we must begin," Spaeth said.

Delaware is the most attractive state for manufacturing, according to a survey 
of state officials and business groups issued today by the accounting firm 
Grant Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
Delaware replaced New Hampshire, which fell from No. 1 in the 1988 survey to 
No. 3 in this year's edition behind Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Praetz, manager of the survey, said Delaware was favored because of its 
skilled work force, wage levels and government policies toward manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Praetz acknowledged that states such as New Hampshire, Vermont and Mississippi 
-- usually ranked high in the survey -- have not become manufacturing giants. 
</P>
<P>
And states ranked low on the list, including No. 22-ranked California, have had 
significant growth in manufacturing in the last year, he said.

<P>
Japan's trade surplus dropped 27% in May, the government reported today, giving 
a sign that the nation's embarrassingly large gap between exports and imports 
is finally closing. 
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus with the United States dropped 19%, reinforcing optimism that 
the overall imbalance may be shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
But economists said the correction process in trade with the United States 
could be undermined if the dollar's recent appreciation against the yen 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if this month's trade picture is good, exchange rate developments in 
coming months could offset the trend and make the Japanese trade surplus 
increase," said economist Soichi Enkyo at Bank of Tokyo Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus in May narrowed to $3.78 billion from $5.19 billion a year 
earlier. Although exports were up 4.9% to $21.67 billion, imports climbed a 
strong 15.7% to $17.89 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States rose 3.2% but imports surged 24.4%.

British advertising giant Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC today reported an 
almost 70% drop in profits and said it might shed its consulting division. 
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement that it has appointed a U.S. investment bank, 
the Blackstone Group, to develop proposals to float off its consultancy unit. 
</P>
<P>
Saatchi entered the consultancy business in 1984 and last year said the 
division was the 10th-largest in the world. But the advertising group was said 
to be increasingly disappointed with results from the consulting unit, and its 
sale has been rumored. 
</P>
<P>
The company's financial results, released today, showed a sharp drop in 
earnings as pretax profit after exceptional items plunged from $95.9 million to 
$30.7 million in the six months ended March 31.

Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's book "Perestroika" has earned him $1.5 
million in royalties in West Germany alone, his German publisher said today. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Schaper, head of the publishing house Droemer Knaur Verlag, said it is 
possible that Gorbachev's global royalties to date total as much as $7.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
He said the book has sold about 10 million copies worldwide and 800,000 copies 
since it came out in late 1987 in West Germany, where people greeted Gorbachev 
as if he were a pop star during his visit this week. "Perestroika" is currently 
seventh on West Germany's best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has said royalties will be shared by the Communist Party and social 
purposes such as relief for earthquake victims in Armenia, the Soviet cultural 
fund and a children's park in Moscow.

Former USC and All-Pro linebacker Chip Banks has been arrested and charged with 
possession of crack cocaine and marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, 28, of Atlanta, was arrested Tuesday at a housing project known for drug 
transactions, police Sgt. P. L. Mitchell said. Banks dropped a brown bag 
containing one dose of crack and a bag of marijuana on the ground when police 
approached, officers said. He is serving a five-year probation for a March 
conviction of cocaine and marijuana possession, stemming from an October 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, a top college player at USC, was the third player selected in the 1982 
NFL draft. He played five years with the Cleveland Browns and was traded to the 
San Diego Chargers in 1987. He refused to sign a contract with the Chargers 
last season and sat out the year. He did not play because of a drug problem, 
Banks' agent, Harold Daniels, said after the March conviction.

The 1986 suspension of trainer Gary Mosher's license has been reinstated by the 
New York State Court of Appeals, the New York State Racing and Wagering Board 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
After a race at Monticello on Dec. 22, 1984, a urine sample from Ryan's Choice, 
a horse trained by Mosher, was found to contain the drug prednisolone, a 
steroid with anti-inflammatory properties. Testimony at a subsequent hearing 
established the drug had been administered within 48 hours before the race. 
</P>
<P>
A lower court overturned the suspension handed down by the Racing and Wagering 
Board, but the Court of Appeals concluded that the Appellate Division had 
"misapplied the trainer responsibility rule." The court found that as the 
horse's trainer, Mosher was presumed responsible for the presence of the drug 
and had failed to refute this presumption.
