RITCHIE VALENS LIVES ON IN HEARTS OF FANS AS HIS STAR IS SET ON WALK OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
To Connie Alvarez, there is no such thing as "The Day the Music Died." Her 
brother, Chicano rock 'n' roll legend Ritchie Valens, is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I could go on and on about the day he died," Alvarez said in an emotionally 
charged voice, "because I've even been to the snow-filled cornfield in Iowa 
(where he died in a plane crash). But this day is for the living. Ritchie is 
alive in the hearts and minds of all his fans." 
</P>
<P>
It was that spirit for life -- not death -- that dominated a nostalgic tribute 
to Valens, whose hit "Donna" rocketed him to stardom in 1958, as 200 fans 
gathered on Hollywood Boulevard last month to see him honored with the 1,913th 
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Valens, whose real name was Richard Valenzuela, is considered to be the first 
Chicano to make it big in rock music. In a span of less than 18 months in 1958 
and '59, his songs "Donna," "Come On, Let's Go," "That's My Little Susie" and 
his rollicking version of "La Bamba," the traditional Mexican folk song, made 
him a star. 
</P>
<P>
He was on tour with singer Buddy Holly and Texas disc jockey J. P. (The Big 
Bopper) Richardson when their small plane crashed in a frozen Iowa cornfield on 
Feb. 3, 1959, killing them. Valens was only 17 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 song, "American Pie," etched their deaths into popular music mythology 
by repeatedly referring to the tragedy as "the day the music died." 
</P>
<P>
But to those attending the Walk of Fame ceremony, the guitar-strumming 
teen-ager from Pacoima was still very much with them. 
</P>
<P>
"He may be dead, but he's still alive to me," said 46-year-old Rudy Ortega of 
Norwalk. "I can sing the words to all his songs." 
</P>
<P>
Since his death 31 years ago, the legend of Valens and his love for his 
girlfriend, Donna, have grown. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Velez drove all night from Salt Lake City to get a glimpse of Donna 
Ludwig-Coots at the ceremony -- as promised by the event's organizers. Although 
she failed to show, he wasn't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"Ritchie knew her," he said. "I know her through the words. I guess that's good 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
While the demand for Valens' records has grown, his fans and relatives have 
been clamoring for greater recognition of his accomplishments. They began a 
drive to get Valens a star on the Walk of Fame as the ultimate recognition of 
his success. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Rocha, leader of a rock group that Valens joined before going solo, said 
the singer was a pioneering influence on the many Latino musicians who came 
after him. And he was also a role model, Rocha said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ritchie Valens was pure," Rocha said. "He didn't do drugs. He did not abuse 
alcohol or smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Friends formed the Ritchie Valens Recognition Committee and raised the $3,500 
for installation of the star on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was laced with cheers and shouts at the mere mention of links to 
Valens' past -- San Fernando, Pacoima or even the word "Chicano." 
</P>
<P>
Latino singers who came after Valens appreciate his pioneering contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Chicano singer Chris Montez, whose hits of the 1960s included "Call Me," "Let's 
Dance" and "Because of You," drew the loudest cheer at the Walk of Fame 
ceremony when he picked Connie Alvarez's theme and shouted at the crowd: 
</P>
<P>
"Que Viva Ritchie Valens!"

HOLLYWOOD BOWL EVENT A MARIACHI MILESTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEORDAN LEGON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodri J. Rodriguez said the idea came into her head about a year ago while at 
the International Mariachi Conference in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban-born Rodriguez wanted to create a milestone mariachi event in Los 
Angeles. What resulted was the first Mariachi USA Festival to be held Sunday, 
June 24, at the 18,000-seat Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I envision a show I need to bring it to life so that others can enjoy it 
too," said Rodriguez, the owner of the Rodri Group production company that is 
organizing the $250,000 event. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, director of the show, received advice from Grammy Award winners 
Linda Ronstadt and Vikki Carr while planning the event. Rodriguez, 35, is a 
friend of Carr and serves as president of the scholarship foundation named 
after the singer. Ronstadt accepted Carr's invitation to perform at the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Other entertainers at the event will include Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan, a 
Mexican group that is one of the best-known mariachi bands in the world; 
Mariachi Campanas de America of San Antonio, and three Los Angeles area groups. 
The local groups are Mariachi Sol de Mexico, which performs at Cielito Lindo 
Mexican restaurant in El Monte; Mariachi Los Camperos, which plays at La Fonda 
Mexican restaurant, and Mariachi Los Galleros, which performs at El Rey Mexican 
restaurant in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
"These mariachis are the best in the business, especially Vargas," said Steven 
Loza, professor of music at UCLA and an expert on mariachis. "The music will be 
of first caliber." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said this is the most challenging endeavor she has undertaken in her 
14-year career as a concert promoter/producer. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez admittedly views the show with the same optimism and determination 
that are part of her everyday life. She said she acquired these qualities after 
her parents sent a 7-year-old Rodriguez from Cuba to the United States, where 
the girl had no one waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to save me from communism," remembered Rodriguez, who left Cuba in 
1962. Rodriguez was 14 and had lived for seven years in temporary refugee camps 
and in the home of a New Mexico family when her parents joined her in the 
United States. "I became strong during those years away from my parents," she 
recalled recently. Another pivotal action, she said, was her insistence in the 
mid-1970s that a Latin category be added to the Grammy Awards, an 
accomplishment for which she became well-known. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez is completing a second four-year term as the only Latina on the Los 
Angeles Cultural Affairs Commission. 
</P>
<P>
She said Rodri Group acts as a liaison between American entertainers and 
European and Latin American production companies interested in having U.S. 
talent perform in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariachi USA, June 24 at 6 p.m. Bowl gates open at 4 p.m. Tickets at 
Ticketmaster locations. ($10 to $50 each.)

CULTURE CLASH GOES FOR THE FUNNY BONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Culture Clash, the Latino comedy troupe starting a 11-week run at the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center on June 22, rarely misses an opportunity to acknowledge 
its roots and credit its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco troupe's show, "The Mission," is a satiric look at Father 
Junipero Serra and the campaign to make him a saint. The show is dedicated to 
Mexican-American folk singer Lalo Guerrero for his "preservation of Chicano 
history. His music will always inspire us, as it has our fathers and mothers, 
and their fathers and mothers." Twice during "The Mission," Guerrero's recorded 
voice can be heard singing "No Chicanos on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Culture Clash's young members -- Ricardo Salinas, Richard Montoya and Herbert 
Siguenza -- also consider themselves part of the political tradition of El 
Teatro Campesino. Under the watchful eyes of El Teatro's Luis Valdez, director 
of "La Bamba," the group shaped the initial production of "The Mission" in 
workshop productions at teatro's base in San Juan Bautista. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we could exist without all having the training and background of 
the Teatro," said Salinas, like Siguenza, the son of Salvadoran immigrants. 
"Our style is very Teatro Campesino." Montoya's father, the poet and artist 
Jose Montoya, once worked as an organizer for the United Farm Workers in 
Delano. 
</P>
<P>
While much of Culture Clash's material is hard-edged and contemporary, the 
group is rarely preachy, feeling free to make fun of friends and allies as well 
as adversaries. As Montoya ruefully observes of the 1980s, "How were we 
supposed to know that the Decade of the Hispanic would turn out to be a weekend 
sponsored by Coors?" 
</P>
<P>
The premise of "The Mission" is that one of Father Serra's mistreated Indian 
acolytes is transported from the 18th Century to the present, landing in the 
body of one of three struggling comedians living together in San Francisco's 
Mission District. The narrative gets a bit complicated after that -- involving 
a plot to kidnap singer Julio Iglesias, masterfully parodied by Siguenza -- but 
that doesn't matter much. More than anything, "The Mission" is a vehicle to 
showcase the many talents of the three actors. 
</P>
<P>
They sing, they dance, they do impressions. In an instant, they can shift from 
the most physical and juvenile slapstick to the most subtle wordplays. In a 
Latin twist to the famous United Negro College Fund appeal, Siguenza complains 
that "a Mayan is a terrible thing to waste." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Culture Clash has been scheduled to appear at LATC's 
Latino Theatre Lab. But last September the Los Angeles appearance was 
postponed, when Salinas was hit by a shotgun blast at close range in front of 
his San Francisco apartment when he tried to stop a fight. For days, he hovered 
near death. 
</P>
<P>
The group, says Montoya, "has been anchored by this tragedy." The experience, 
he says, has given more resonance to the gang material in "The Mission," which 
satirizes the deadly phenomenon without approving of its effects or denigrating 
the individuals who are caught up in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mission" by Culture Clash. Set design by Gronk. Performances Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday at 8 p.m., Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m., June 22-Sept. 2. 
At LATC, 514 South Spring St. Tickets: $15-$18. (213) 627-6500. Ext. 256.

FAST-PROFIT DEAL TURNS INTO LOSS FOR INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catalina Torres and her husband were told in late 1988 they had two years to 
find somewhere else to live. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment building the South-Central Los Angeles couple calls home is 
scheduled to be demolished by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Torres decided it was time they bought a house, but she figured they needed 
more than the $40,000 they had saved. While watching Spanish-language 
television, Torres saw an ad for Santa Ana-based American Finance and 
Investment Group (Inversiones y Finanzas America), which was guaranteeing a 
hefty 22% interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
She paid a visit to the company's East Los Angeles office and met with a 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
"I went there and I spoke to him before I gave him the money and he told me 
they were a company that had been in business 25 years," Torres said. "He said 
the money was going to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
She invested $40,000 in January, 1989, but instead of earning interest on the 
amount, she apparently has lost it all. Now the Torres couple is not sure where 
they and their two children are going to live when their apartment building is 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state authorities say American Finance was nothing more than a 
well-contrived scam, the largest ever perpetrated on the Latino community in 
Southern California. The company's owner -- Jose Manuel de la Jara -- operated 
a Ponzi scheme through the company in order to enrich himself from March, 1988, 
through September, 1989, investigators claim. 
</P>
<P>
So far, a state-appointed receiver -- who is selling off De la Jara's estate -- 
has identified 700 investors who have lost more than $8.2 million. Most of the 
money has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
The victims are nearly all working class, scattered around Southern California. 
Very few speak English. 
</P>
<P>
"People are in financial ruins," said Carlos Negrete, a San Juan Capistrano 
attorney representing several victims. "I don't know of one family that wasn't 
literally devastated by it." 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara is under investigation for possible bank and mail fraud violations 
by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say he was not the godsend he seemed. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, De la Jara is wanted by Interpol -- the international police 
agency -- for misappropriation and swindling in his native Peru. Police there 
say he carried out a scheme similar to American Finance, bilking Peruvian 
investors out of $7 million in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being an alleged con artist, federal authorities said De la Jara 
launders money for associates of the Medellin drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted in April on money-laundering charges in U.S. District Court in 
Los Angeles. The prosecution introduced into evidence scores of documents 
seized from De la Jara's home and business, including a notebook full of names 
and telephone numbers of narcotics traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara, 44, has been held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. 
He refused to be interviewed for this story, but in the past has denied the 
charges against him. He has said he is an honest businessman, forced out of 
Peru because of threats against his life. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, De la Jara and his son were kidnaped in Lima by the feared Los 
Retacos gang of brothers -- Peru's version of Jesse and Frank James -- who 
strapped dynamite to De la Jara's chest and threatened to blow him up unless 
his well-to-do family paid them $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
They handed over the ransom and then fled to the United States, where he 
eventually started American Finance. De la Jara's salespeople touted him as a 
rich businessman from Peru. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a Latino, and he was getting ahead so I figured I could too," said Los 
Angeles investor Jose Espinosa De Los Monteros. 
</P>
<P>
The company told investors they would earn very high interest on money lent to 
American Finance, which would be secured by trust deeds on one of 16 different 
properties the company had acquired around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
People invested anywhere from $1,000 to $300,000 -- the average loan was about 
$40,000. The company had promised to give trust deeds on the properties to 
anybody lending American Finance more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Corporations claims American Finance sought loans on 
the same properties over and over again and then issued numerous trust deeds on 
the same house. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, early investors in American Finance didn't suspect anything was 
wrong because monthly interest was paid on time. But state officials say that 
was because De la Jara was running a Ponzi scheme -- paying older investors 
with the money provided by new investors. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say they don't know how much money -- if anything at all -- can 
be returned to investors. 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMER ALERT 
</P>
<P>
Officials advise consumers to be careful if an investment promises an interest 
return that is far above what banks or savings and loan offices may offer. 
Consumers may call the following numbers for information and assistance: 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Consumer Affairs Department: (213) 974-1452 or 260-2893

One of the busiest people in Hollywood Wednesday was Tanya Stiehr, the 
receptionist for the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
She had the TV show "Hard Copy" to blame. 
</P>
<P>
The program profiled the late actress Vivian Vance, who played the cantankerous 
Ethel Mertz on "I Love Lucy." It pointed out that she's the only "Lucy" star 
who is not on the Hollywood Walk of Fame -- Fred Mertz's last laugh? -- and 
gave out the chamber's telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
Stiehr estimated that more than 3,000 people from across the nation phoned 
Wednesday to demand a star for Ethel, though Walk of Fame membership is 
determined by chamber officials. 
</P>
<P>
One caller was a Tennessee woman who said she wanted "her namesake to have a 
star." 
</P>
<P>
Her name: Ethel Mertz Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank private investigator Jan Tucker calls himself a "hired mud-slinger." 
</P>
<P>
That is, if you're running for office, he'll dig into the past of your opponent 
-- legally, of course. Criminal complaint filings. Lawsuits. Public records. 
(But he doesn't do third-rate burglaries.) 
</P>
<P>
"More and more candidates are using detectives," the political private eye 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, 34, claims he helped one candidate win a municipal election this year, 
but can't divulge details. (Snooper-client privilege.) 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he say whether the congressional campaign in the 22nd District in the 
San Gabriel Valley is going to get nasty: Tucker is the Peace and Freedom party 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker knows what it's like to have mud slung. An opponent in a previous Peace 
and Freedom primary took note of Tucker's first name and his self-description 
as a "socialist-feminist" and spread a rumor that he actually was a male 
impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be no dull, long-winded graduation ceremony tonight at the mid-city 
Business Industry School, whose enrollment includes many teen-age mothers 
working toward high school diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Boulevard occupational school's students, under the direction of 
artist Victoria Ann Lewis, will present a play entitled, "Teen-age Ninja 
Mothers." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Rosenstein of Cheviot Hills bought a canister of red, green and yellow 
popcorn in a Beverly Hills department store, only to discover that "it was 
awful -- it tasted so stale." 
</P>
<P>
When she returned it and asked whether the store had received a lot of 
complaints about it, a clerk answered: 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I don't know of anybody else who's tried our pet 
popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenstein looked at the label and promptly quit barking at the clerk.

CONTINUING CONTROVERSY OVER FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The furor over the NEA funding of what many feel is unworthy art is becoming 
ridiculous. Artists and art groups object to the requirement that they sign the 
"equivalent of an anti-obscenity pledge" in order to get their money from the 
NEA, saying that this is censorship of art. 
</P>
<P>
Not so. They can continue to produce obscene work and peddle it to anyone who 
cares to buy it. Those who reject such work should not be required to fund it 
through an agency supported by tax money. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA should be held accountable for permitting the type of "art" which 
caused this furor. If it continues to function it must exercise some discretion 
as to what our tax money is paying for. If this is censorship, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
If the NEA is unable or unwilling to assume the responsibility to reject 
unworthy art, then the NEA should be abolished. I'm sure the nation would 
survive.

VANDALISM AND HATE CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the vandalism of St. Francis of Assisi Church misses the point 
("Attacks on Church Part of Rise in Hate Crimes," Metro, May 27). These attacks 
are incorrectly characterized by many, including the conservative majority of 
the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, as hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that whoever these vandals are, they are not protesting the 
church's wafer and wine, statuary, prayer beads or incense. Any attack against 
the use of these implements and their associated rites are and should be 
considered hate crimes. They are not the issues here. 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism, though regrettable, is clearly in protest of the church's 
anti-life AIDS policies, and anti-choice abortion policy. If churches are going 
to encourage their parishioners to engage in political activity, if church 
officials are going to take controversial political stands and threaten 
political candidates with ecclesiastical retaliation unless they apply church 
teachings to their secular responsibilities, they cannot expect to be exempt 
from protest. 
</P>
<P>
They cannot cry foul when confronted with the anger of those who work to 
protect the rights and health of citizens.

ARTS FUNDING ON THE MAT AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
* ENDOWMENT SHOWDOWN NEARS IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the last years of his life, William Butler Yeats offered this poetic 
testament to colleagues confronting a future in which their work increasingly 
would be judged and supported according to its political coloration: 
</P>
<P>
 Irish poets, learn your trade, 
</P>
<P>
 Sing whatever is well made. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two decades, that is all the National Endowment for the Arts has 
asked of American artists -- that they sing, write, dance, paint and perform 
well. That is all that should be asked; in fact, it is all that can be asked, 
if the NEA is to remain what its name correctly suggests it is: a modest public 
endowment whose funds secure for all Americans those benefits of aesthetic 
culture formerly reserved for the wealthy and the privileged. 
</P>
<P>
The details of the conflict surrounding the NEA's funding of a handful of works 
deemed objectionable by religious conservatives are, by now, too tedious to 
rehearse. But matters may well come to a head next week, when the future 
conditions of the endowment's funding will be taken up by the Education and 
Labor committees of both the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the public's right to choose for itself what sort of art it will 
enjoy are fighting to ensure that the endowment be allowed to continue making 
its grants solely on the basis of artistic merit. Reasonable people are bound 
to differ on what constitutes merit, but sorting such questions out is one of 
the pleasures to be derived from real art. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the public's right to choose -- and, in some cases, of the NEA's 
very existence -- want to legally restrict the content of art funded in any way 
by the endowment. Some of these critics simply want to ban art that they think 
is obscene. Others want to prohibit works they feel are blasphemous or 
denigrate the artifacts or beliefs of a particular religion. Reasonable people 
will not be left to sort out their inevitable differences over such questions. 
If the NEA's critics have their way, Congress, the courts and cops will do that 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, the Bush Administration has understood this and, therefore, 
opposed the imposition of content restrictions on NEA grants. Unfortunately, 
the White House -- increasingly mindful of its problems on the Republican 
right, where most of the NEA's antagonists are found -- now has abandoned its 
principled position. 
</P>
<P>
In this, as in the flag-burning controversy, then, it falls to Congress to put 
courage before calculation. It would be a tragic paradox if, in the year of 
freedom's triumph in so many unexpected places, the United States undertook, 
for the first time in its history, the formal restriction of both political and 
artistic speech. 
</P>
<P>
Legal censorship of the arts and restriction of free expression of the sort 
Congress is contemplating are not slippery slopes. They are precipices, and 
once we step over them, there will be little but luck to break our fall.

CONTINUING CONTROVERSY OVER FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The essay by Edwin Meese III and Bruce Fein ("High Clerics of Art Have Had 
Enough," Commentary, May 21) shows that, when it comes to art, everyone has an 
opinion. Their opinion, to which they are entitled in this free and diverse 
country, is that the National Endowment for the Arts ought to be abolished. The 
case upon which they build it, however, is not one to inspire confidence in 
them as either art critics or lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
They assert that the public would have been better off investing in "defaulted 
junk bonds" than in government-assisted art because the endowment has not 
produced "artistic masterpieces that promise to live for the ages," that there 
have been no "NEA-funded artists who would do honor to Van Gogh, Picasso, 
Mozart, Rubens, Monet, Beethoven, Voltaire or Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
How to address this remarkable conclusion? With the fact that the authors are 
comparing contemporary artists helped in the last 25 years with recognized 
masters, many of whom were long dead by the time their work was fully 
appreciated? With the irony in their naming only European artists, implying 
that America is a cultural wasteland? With their criticism of NEA Chairman John 
Frohnmayer, whom they say "shows no glitter as a talent scout for fledgling 
genius?" True enough, Frohnmayer has been on the job for seven months and 
hasn't a single Shakespeare to his credit. Get with it, John! 
</P>
<P>
In commenting on what they perceive as the "arrogance" of the arts community in 
its request for a comparatively small amount of federal leadership and 
assistance, Meese and Fein assert that only freeloaders accept even meager 
support from their government. Is it not ironic, if not arrogant, for those who 
have made part of their own living and reputations on taxpayer support to 
suggest that the only good artist is a starving artist? 
</P>
<P>
The nation would have been better served had public officials paid more 
attention to the criminal conditions and bungling that led to the "defaulted 
junk bonds" and savings and loan crisis. The $2,000 bill each American likely 
will have to pay to remedy that fiasco pales next to the 68 cents per year each 
pays for the arts endowment and its support of arts education programs, 
museums, local orchestras, theater and dance companies and public television 
programs. What will it be, folks: 68 cents for the arts or $2,000 to help 
defray the cost of a junk bond dealer's Mercedes? 
</P>
<P>
I can hardly wait to see their next opinion piece, "Meese and Fein on 
Investing."

ANOTHER WIN FOR WORD POWER; 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. MUST FOCUS ON AIDING NICARAGUA NOW, AND DO IT ZEALOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week's demobilization of the Nicaraguan rebel army included a powerful act 
of symbolism for all Central America. When the Contras' weapons, last fired 
only weeks ago, were sliced in half by blowtorches, it proved the power of 
words over the roar of cannons. It was words -- dialogue, peace negotiations -- 
that convinced both sides in the Nicaraguan conflict to hold elections, to 
accept the outcome and, finally, to beat their swords into plowshares. 
</P>
<P>
Not once in the eight years of the civil war did military pressure bring the 
Sandinista government and the Contra leadership face to face. Superpower 
posturing didn't lead to solutions, either. The conflict simply exhausted 
Nicaraguans, who were more concerned with putting food on the table and keeping 
sons out of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the Iran-Contra scandal left Washington with a Central American 
policy vacuum did Nicaragua's political agenda revert to the region's leaders: 
Most notably former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who won a Nobel Peace 
Prize for authoring the peace plan that led to Nicaragua's elections. And only 
after U.S. military aid to the Contras was cut off did they finally sit down to 
seriously negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
United States policy-makers, in particular, must understand the value that 
simple dialogue played in bringing this long war to an end. Negotiations must 
also be pushed in nearby El Salvador, where a shorter but bloodier civil war 
still rages with U.S. taxpayers footing the bill for the government side. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's new president, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, must scramble to forge 
national unity among those who have spent a decade doing battle with one 
another. And she must salvage her country's economy, shattered after years of 
war. That's where U.S. policy-makers must focus their efforts to help Nicaragua 
now. And they must do so with all the zeal they showed while supporting the 
Contras for far too long.

FACT WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
ODD SLANT ON LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The redistricting lawsuit Los Angeles County's Board of Supervisors lost last 
week is complex, and to fully understand its significance you must know some of 
the history of anti-Mexican discrimination hereabouts. Ignorance of that 
history accounts for the simplistic analysis being done by otherwise reliable 
news organizations in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, for example, the Wall Street Journal's editorial page criticized the 
lawsuit, hitting at the "liberals" who filed it for pressing forward despite 
the fact a Latina, Sarah Flores, might get elected to the board in November's 
election. Their conclusion: local "liberals" are afraid of Flores, a 
"conservative" Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Well, L.A. politics isn't so simple. As anyone who knows her can tell you, 
Flores is no knee-jerk ideologue. Like most Mexican-American Republicans, she's 
"conservative" on some issues, "liberal" on others. And her supporters in the 
Latino community reflect that subtle reality, including Chicanos who've also 
supported politicos that conservatives love to hate, like Assemblyman Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the lawsuit against the supervisors has less to do with liberal versus 
conservative than it does with good versus bad government. If pundits who watch 
from afar would take a closer, less ideological, look at the redistricting 
case, they'd be supporting the plan put forward by the victorious plaintiffs, 
to expand the county board so that not just one Sarah Flores can be elected, 
but several.

PERSPECTIVES ON FREE SPEECH; 
</P>
<P>
FLAG FLIES OVER SOME AMERICAN TRUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No speech, however obscene or inflammatory, injures America as much as the 
Supreme Court does -- all nine justices -- when speaking about First Amendment 
protections of speech. It almost invariably miseducates the nation about the 
nation's premises. It has done so again, concerning flag burning. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a protester burned a flag in Dallas to express loathing for America. 
Convicted under a Texas statute proscribing desecration of the flag in a way 
that would give offense to onlookers, he appealed to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, the court overturned his conviction, arguing that flag burning is 
"sufficiently imbued with elements of communication" to be constitutionally 
protected "symbolic expression," which the court erroneously considers a 
synonym for "speech." 
</P>
<P>
Congress promptly passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989 criminalizing 
desecration. Protesters promptly burned flags to protest (among other things) 
the act. Now the Supreme Court has agreed with the lower courts that said 
prosecutions would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The court was divided 5-4, but the decision is fundamentally uninteresting 
because the majority and the dissenters do not differ about fundamentals. All 
nine justices share the flaccid, false consensus about what the Founders 
intended by First Amendment speech protection. 
</P>
<P>
If you agree, as all nine justices do, that the First Amendment forbids 
limiting particular forms of expression to protect particular ideas -- if, that 
is, you agree that the Constitution forbids "establishment" of particular 
political ideas -- the result the court reached is logically entailed. But did 
the Founders mean to forbid such partiality toward particular ideas? They did 
not. That they did not is, we may say, self-evident. 
</P>
<P>
Sufficient proof (but not the only proof) is that the Constitution guarantees 
the supremacy of -- "establishes," if you will, as American political orthodoxy 
-- certain political ideas. The Constitution forbids the establishment of a 
particular religion but requires the establishment of a particular form of 
government. It does so by guaranteeing to each state "a republican form of 
government." (Article IV, Section 4.) 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the First Amendment explicitly distinguishes religious speech from 
other kinds by proscribing "establishment" of (government partiality toward) a 
particular religion. Why? Walter Berns of Georgetown University argues, 
correctly, that the Founders believed that fundamental religious truth may be 
unknowable, and certainly, so far as government is concerned, there is no such 
thing as religious truth. But the Founders believed that fundamental political 
truths are not merely knowable, they are (as Jefferson proclaimed in the 
nation's primary document, the Declaration of Independence) "self-evident." 
</P>
<P>
By forbidding "establishment" of religion, the Constitution mandates 
illimitable pluralism and government impartiality. But the Constitution 
mandates agnosticism only about religious, not political, ideas. The Founders 
knew that a political constitution mandating agnosticism about political ideas 
and outcomes would be an absurdity. The First Amendment amends a political 
document and takes its meaning from the context of the document's language and 
structure, including the proclamation of national political orthodoxy (the 
guarantee of a republican form of government). This is why the word speech 
should be taken seriously, not supplanted by expression. 
</P>
<P>
The Founders, sharing Aristotle's definition of man as a language-using animal, 
specified protection of "speech." They did so because speech is intrinsically 
connected with the distinctive human capacity, reason, by which individuals 
govern themselves and communities achieve self-government. 
</P>
<P>
After many years of miseducation, the court is convinced of, and hence the 
country is committed to, this proposition: The Constitution mandates protection 
of any behavior that "expresses" a politically tinged attitude. Today's court 
cannot fathom that the Founders used language with a precision -- a precision 
born of philosophic clarity and subtlety -- that is foreign to the court.

AFTER BREAKING RECORD, 80-FOOT SHOTPUT LOOKS CLOSER TO BARNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After breaking the world shotput record last month with a toss of 75 feet 10 
1/4 inches, Randy Barnes takes aim at the 80-foot barrier in the USA/Mobil 
National Championships today at Cerritos College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that an 80-foot throw is much more believable now," Barnes 
said. "It's not really a question of if, but when." 
</P>
<P>
After opening the 1990 outdoor season with a toss of 73-1 1/4, Barnes set the 
record in a meet at UCLA, becoming the first American in 14 years to hold the 
mark. He nearly broke the record the next week with a toss of 75-9 1/2 at San 
Jose. 
</P>
<P>
But Barnes said his world-record put wasn't technically perfect, explaining: 
"My release wasn't solid, but I got the record because I'm in such good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the top athletes in American track and field are entered in the 
USA/Mobil meet, including Roger Kingdom and Carl Lewis. The meet is The 
Athletics Congress' qualifier for the Goodwill Games in Seattle July 20-Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, world record-holder in the 110-meter high hurdles with a time of 12.92 
seconds, will seek his third consecutive national title. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to break the world record again," Kingdom told the Associated Press. 
"I'm not saying I'm going to get it, but I'm going to go after it." 
</P>
<P>
A two-time Olympic gold medalist, Kingdom was named the sport's top athlete 
last season. And he is off to a fast start this season, winning three races. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure is on my back," Kingdom said. "I have to perform well all the 
time. And I have to set an example for everyone everywhere I go. 
</P>
<P>
"I also have to make the fans happy wherever I compete. You can't win them all, 
but you can put on a good show." 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom will be challenged by Renaldo Nehemiah, a former world record-holder, 
and Tony Dees, who has run 13.09 this season. Dees defeated Kingdom in the 
National Indoor Championships in New York last February. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of guys capable of taking the title, but they're going to have 
to get it from me," Kingdom said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to pose some stiff competition for them. I don't worry about the 
opposition. If you stop and think about them, you'll go nuts." 
</P>
<P>
He does worry about his technique. "I have to work on the first stage of the 
race, the first three hurdles, if I am to improve my time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's field, Sheila Hudson of California, who won the long jump and 
triple jump in the NCAA championships earlier this month, will attempt to 
repeat the double in the TAC meet. She has long jumped 22-1 this season, the 
top score in the nation, and 46- 3/4 in the triple jump, an American record. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson will be challenged by Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who has jumped 21-10 3/4 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
In the decathlon, Dave Johnson fashioned a remarkable second-day comeback to 
win with the second-highest score ever by an American. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 27, completed the grinding 10-event, two-day competition with a 
wind-aided score of 8,600 points, leading a group of seven over the 8,000-point 
barrier -- the first time so many Americans exceeded that total in the same 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's total trails only the record of 8,634, set by Bruce Jenner in winning 
the gold medal at the 1976 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been training through this for the Goodwill Games," Johnson said. 
"There's no limit to what I can score." 
</P>
<P>
In the heptathlon final, Cindy Greiner, 33, won her second national title, 
finishing the seven-event, two-day competition with a wind-aided score of 6,262 
points, only 35 points below her best. NCAA champion Gea Johnson of Arizona 
State was second with a wind-aided 6,135 points and Sharon Hainer third with 
6,030. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Butch Reynolds, the world record-holder in the 400 meters, and four others were 
declared late entries Wednesday. They include: Jeff Reynolds (400), Olympic

sprinter Gwen Torrence.

When the power-steering fluid ran dry in Roger Mears' pickup truck during the 
400-mile Baja Internacional off-road race, his riding mechanic, Tony Alvarez, 
crawled out on the hood while Mears was driving between 50 and 60 m.p.h. over 
the bumpy terrain and added fluid. 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd stopped to do it, we'd have lost," Mears said matter-of-factly. Mears 
and Alvarez won their class by four minutes over Manny Esquerra's Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Offbeat recruiting: Among those requesting press credentials for this week's 
national track and field meet at Cerritos College was Tony Carlino of Lake 
Placid, N.Y., the U.S. Olympic bobsled coach. 
</P>
<P>
So, why the interest in track and field? Carlino told meet organizers that he 
planned on approaching such track stars as Edwin Moses, Carl Lewis and Roger 
Kingdom with proposals that they try out for the U.S. bobsled team for the 1992 
Winter Olympics at Albertville, France. He obviously wants to get his team off 
to a fast start. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What did Glen Campbell, Joe Garagiola, Andy Williams, Jackie 
Gleason, Danny Thomas, Bing Crosby and Sammy Davis Jr. all have in common?

Excuses, excuses: Laurent Fignon's ponytail hanging out from beneath his helmet 
might have been the difference between losing and winning last year's Tour de 
France. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Chester Pyle, a student of the aerodynamics of bicycles, claims 
after simulating in a wind tunnel the final day's sprint from Versailles to the 
Champs Elysees in Paris. He says the ponytail cost the French rider eight 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Greg LeMond won by that margin after overcoming a 53-second disadvantage going 
into the final day's ride. 
</P>
<P>
Soul tennis: Jennifer Capriati dazzled onlookers at the French Open with her 
tennis -- and also with her latest in teen-age handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a forehand, backhand, volley, slice and overhead," she explained after a 
demonstration of two handclasps, two knuckle raps and a high-five. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back: On June 14, 1969, Reggie Jackson had his biggest batting day in 
the major leagues when he drove in 10 runs with two home runs, a double and two 
singles for the Oakland A's against the Red Sox in Boston. On the other side of 
the coin, Cecil Cooper of the Red Sox struck out six times in one game on June 
14, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: In 1980, their names were attached to PGA Tour events, but all 
have since been replaced by corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
No respect: Move over, Rodney Dangerfield. Make room for Buster Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas may be the world heavyweight boxing champion, but in the mind of Art 
Manteris, vice president of the Las Vegas Hilton Race and Sports SuperBook, he 
is no better than a 2 1/2-1 underdog against Evander Holyfield in their Sept. 
20 fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Buster Douglas certainly scored an impressive win over Mike Tyson last 
February," Manteris said, "but it doesn't mean that Douglas is an awesome 
fighter. I'm not entirely sold on his boxing ability against top-ranked 
opponents."

course." SHAV GLICK

The Trail Blazers were right. They probably won't have to go back to Detroit. .

<P>
It's time to give the Bad Boys their due. They've won seven of their last eight

achievement is more significant than last year's, when they swept a Laker team 
that was crippled. . . .

The officials guessed right Tuesday night in Portland when they ruled that 
Danny Young's potential game-tying basket failed to beat the buzzer by tenths

COMPUTER FILE: SOVIETS SEEK HIGH-TECH VENTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was meeting with business leaders 
in San Francisco, 11 Soviet scientists were combing Silicon Valley, seeking 
joint ventures with computer and software companies. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which included representatives from the Soviet Academy of Sciences, 
came to the Bay Area for the "Soviet Silicon Summit for High-Tech Trade," 
sponsored by Global Development Corp. of Santa Clara. It also participated in a 
June 8 seminar, "Doing Business With the Soviets," that Global Development 
conducted for the benefit of Silicon Valley firms. 
</P>
<P>
As Gorbachev has repeatedly indicated, the Soviets have a strong interest in 
American computer technology. The Soviet Union has only limited capacity to 
produce IBM-compatible PCs. The current five-year economic plan calls for 
producing 6.3 million machines between now and 1995. Most will be IBM 
XT-compatible systems, although there will be some production of 286- and 
386-based PCs. The demand for PCs far outstrips domestic capacity. Dataquest 
estimates that the Soviets will import 28 million PCs by the end of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandre Giglavyi, affiliated with Moscow State University, told me that there 
are between 500,000 and 600,000 PCs in the Soviet Union. Most are 
IBM-compatible, although a large number of machines are based on a Japanese 
design that uses the CP/M operating system, which is virtually obsolete in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 computers are used in homes, Giglavyi said. Most home PCs, 
typically 8-bit systems equipped with cassettes to store data, are primitive by 
Western standards. Even floppy disk drives are luxury items. 
</P>
<P>
There are Soviet clones of several popular U.S. designs, including the 
Commodore 64 and the Apple II, but IBM-compatible machines are priced beyond 
the reach of average citizens. An AT-compatible with 1 megabyte of random 
access memory and a 20-megabyte hard disk costs 60,000 rubles. That, according 
to Giglavyi, represents "20 years pay of an average worker." Bargain hunters 
can buy an XT-clone for 35,000 to 45,000 rubles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Giglavyi expects Soviet industries and government agencies to need more than 11 
million PCs between now and 1995, while education will need 17 million to 18 
million. This is far beyond the domestic capacity -- and thus good news for 
Western companies seeking to penetrate the Soviet market. 
</P>
<P>
A Dataquest report, "The U.S.S.R. PC Market," estimates 1990 Soviet imports at 
between 5,000 and 15,000 386 PCs, 100,000 to 200,000 286 machines, 10,000 to 
30,000 PC/XTs and 4,000 to 8,000 Apple Macintoshes. Older-style 8-bit computers 
account for 2,000 to 4,000 imports, according to Dataquest. 
</P>
<P>
Several American firms have made inroads into the Soviet Union, but U.S. 
security regulations have restricted exportation of the most desirable high-end 
systems. That, however, is changing. The United States, as of July 1, will 
decontrol export licensing requirements on most personal computers, including 
386-based PCs (up to 33 megahertz) and all current-generation Macintoshes (up 
to 40 megahertz). 
</P>
<P>
Giglavyi expects schools to purchase a large number of IBM PS/2 Model 25 
systems, but he also anticipates strong sales of machines to smaller companies. 
He characterized IBM as a "huge bureaucracy" that is "very difficult to work 
with." He was referring to the company's inability to make quick policy 
decisions. I found it ironic to hear a Soviet official accuse an American 
company -- even IBM -- of being too bureaucratic, but I was equally surprised 
at the Soviet visitors' entrepreneurial-style ability to make swift business 
decisions in their negotiations with Silicon Valley firms. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet delegation to the Silicon Summit wasn't window-shopping. Its leader, 
Nicolai Kleschev, who heads the Academy of Science's International Center for 
Informatics and Electronics (InterEVM), signed letters of intent to create 
joint ventures with at least three Silicon Valley firms. Letters of intent, 
which indicate a willingness to do business, are not necessarily binding and 
are subject to further negotiations -- but they are nonetheless concrete steps 
toward deals. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the Soviet-U.S. agreements called for bilateral exchanges. The 
Soviets are, admittedly, behind the West in manufacturing and distribution, but 
Academy of Science institutes are engaged in state-of-the-art software 
development and semiconductor research. The Soviets are not interested in being 
passive customers. They are looking for joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Kleschev signed an agreement with Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Fortrend Engineering 
Corp. to develop and manufacture a product based on Soviet innovations in 
cleaning surfaces such as semiconductor wafers and optics. A deal between 
Kleschev and Cypress Semiconductor would give the Silicon Valley firm a license 
to use chips designed by an agency of InterEVM. 
</P>
<P>
One agreement is expected to generate a line of Soviet-American PCs called the 
Perestroika Computer. Fortron/Source, a Livermore, Calif.-based PC 
manufacturer, signed a letter of intent with InterEVM to produce 286 and 386 
PCs to be distributed in the United States and Soviet Union. The machines, 
according to Fortron/Source international sales manager Linda Janssen, will 
initially be manufactured and assembled in California, but long-term plans call 
for the development of Soviet-based manufacturing facilities. The tentative 
agreement also calls for Fortron/Source to help manufacture and market a 
Soviet-designed video display adapter and to import dynamic random access 
memory and other chips from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
A major barrier to U.S.-Soviet trade is the Soviet Union's lack of hard 
currency that can be converted to Western funds. The problem calls for creative 
solutions. Televideo founder Philip Hwang, who attended the one-day seminar, 
told me that his company found itself investing in Soviet hotels and leather 
processing plants to help Soviet organizations generate the cash necessary to 
buy his company's computers. Other American companies are entering into barter 
arrangements involving the exchange of their manufacturing and distribution 
know-how for Soviet software, raw materials, brain power and labor. 
</P>
<P>
If you missed the Silicon Summit, don't despair. There will be plenty of 
chances to meet with Soviet scientists and computer enthusiasts, especially if 
you're willing to travel to their turf. International Data Group (which owns PC 
World, MacWorld, InfoWorld and other computer magazines) is sponsoring a PC 
World Forum in Moscow July 10-15. Orbis International is sponsoring Informatika 
'90 in Moscow Oct. 11-18 and, closer to home, Global Development plans to offer 
follow-up Soviet-American PC summits this fall.

International Data Group at (800) 225-4698 or Orbis International at (415)

<P>
The stock market posted a small loss Wednesday, bogging down after a 
short-lived run toward record highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks, up about 10 points at its best 
afternoon level, finished the day with a 3.47 loss at 2,929.95. The index 
reached its closing peak of 2,935.19 on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 722 up, 786 down and 499 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Wednesday morning that retail sales fell 0.7% 
in May, registering a sharper decline than most analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
That evidence of continued softness in business activity helped push interest 
rates lower in the credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
But stock traders didn't show such clear-cut enthusiasm over the news. Analysts 
said investors were a little unsettled by signs that consumer spending was 
slipping at a time when economic growth appears to be sluggish at best. 
</P>
<P>
Auto issues were fractionally lower after early-June figures for domestic car 
sales came in below expectations. General Motors lost 1/4 to 50, Ford Motor 
fell 1/4 to 46 3/8, and Chrysler dropped 3/8 to 15 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
It was a disastrous day for S&amp;L and bank stocks. S&amp;L stocks plunged 
after HomeFed's announcement that problem loans rose in May. HomeFed tumbled 8 
1/4 to 25. Great Western Financial slumped 1 5/8 to 18 7/8, H. F. Ahmanson 
dropped 1 to 21 1/4, CalFed slumped 1 7/8 to 19 1/2 and Golden West Financial 
was down 1 7/8 at 31 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo lost 2 3/8 to 81 5/8 after Moody's downgraded the company's debt. 
Security Pacific, also downgraded, lost 3/4 to 40 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Over-the-counter stocks bucked the overall down market trend. The NASDAQ 
composite index rose 2.30 points to 468.86, as investors continued to hunt 
among smaller stocks. Some Southland-based OTC stocks that helped lead the 
advance included K-Swiss, up 1 1/4 to 24 3/4; Syncor, up 1/4 to 9 3/8; CIMCO, 
up 1/2 to 13, and Amgen, up 1 1/2 to 74. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 158.91 million shares, up slightly from 157.10 million 
shares traded Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks were mildly firmer at the close in thin trading, breaking a 
three-day losing streak. The Nikkei 225-share index rose 49.46 points to close 
at 32,371.77. 
</P>
<P>
Shares surged to a six-month high on the London Stock Exchange. The Financial 
Times 100-share index closed 34.7 points higher at 2,405.4. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, West Germany, shares ended 0.7% lower after a volatile session. 
The 30-share DAX index ended at 1,787.39, down 12.97 points.

Bond Prices Rise on Retail Sales News 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices, which have been flat the last few sessions, gained ground after 
the release of a government report showing unexpectedly weak retail sales in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose 27/32 point, or $8.44 per $1,000 face 
amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 8.38% from 8.45% 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 15%, up from 8.188% on Tuesday. The figure often 
fluctuates wildly on Wednesday when banks must report their reserves to federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Slumps in Domestic Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended weaker against most major currencies after a mixed performance 
overseas, while the soaring British pound continued to take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers blamed the dollar's decline largely on technical factors, with 
traders selling the dollar to buy the West German mark and Swiss franc. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, high interest rates and growing expectation that Britain will join 
the European Monetary System later this year continued to shore up sterling. 
</P>
<P>
The pound rose to a nearly four-month high against the dollar, dealers said. It 
traded at $1.7070 in London, up from $1.7020 on Tuesday, and at $1.7115 in New 
York, up from $1.7035. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Gold Futures Are Continuing to Slide 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices flirted with $350 an ounce, dropping to within 50 cents of 
that psychologically important level before rebounding to $352, the lowest 
daily settlement on New York's Commodity Exchange in nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $3.70 to $4.90 lower, with the contract for delivery in 
June down $3.70 at $352 an ounce, the lowest settlement of a Comex gold 
contract since July 30, 1986.

MEAL IN DISH FROM PUERTO VALLARTA; 
</P>
<P>
EMISSARY: BEA BENDER'S ARRIVAL IN THE RESORT COMMUNITY BENEFITED MEXICAN AS 
WELL AS AMERICAN MENUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 years ago, an American woman named Bea Bender moved to Puerto Vallarta 
and began to explore the local cuisine. As years passed, Bender became an 
expert in preparing traditional Mexican food and also in adapting the available 
ingredients to American favorites. The result was a weekly cookery column, "Out 
of Bea's Kitchen . . . With Love," that appeared in the English language 
newspaper, Vallarta Today, starting in November, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Bender's recipes ranged from carne asada, nopales salad and guacamole to 
American-style tomato spice cake with cream cheese frosting. In between were 
such cross-cultural dishes as shark bisque, mango bread and tacos filled with 
chicken salad. 
</P>
<P>
When Bender arrived in Vallarta, meals were based largely on seafood and on 
dishes that did not require refrigeration. Local meats were tough, and 
convenience foods were unknown. Not until the early 1980s was whipping cream 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was made from scratch, like cakes, mayonnaise, yogurt, biscuits, or 
brought by northern friends and guests from a long-running want list of 
stateside goodies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City, Bender and her husband, Bernie, lived for many years in 
Van Nuys before moving to Mexico. In Puerto Vallarta, their son, Michael, 
opened the town's first modern, air-conditioned meat market with refrigeration. 
This was the Super Carniceria "Chico's," a place where expatriates could get 
American cuts of beef, and turkeys for Thanksgiving. Bernie Bender, a retired 
dentist, helped out in the market, and Bea provided recipes for the customers 
and cooked batches of deli-style foods. 
</P>
<P>
"My culinary reputation grew rapidly as I found myself preparing kilos of 
granola, sauerkraut, corned beef, mango chutney, sour dill pickles and yogurt 
to service the meat market," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The limited refrigeration, water and electric power shortages of early-day 
Vallarta led to the popularity there of a type of dish called tinga, which 
Bender defined as "a meal-in-a-dish stew." 
</P>
<P>
The following menu centers around Bender's festive chicken tinga, Pollo de la 
Patria. Carrots, chayote, green beans and green pepper go into the pot along 
with the chicken. Almonds, raisins and capers add to the rich flavor, and the 
seasonings include orange juice, saffron, cinnamon and cloves. Baked Cumin 
Rice, a recipe from Bender's column, goes with the chicken. 
</P>
<P>
An appetizer plate, a chilled soup and a chutney show off the fruits and 
vegetables that are so well-liked in Mexico. The appetizer plate combines 
orange and cucumber slices, pickled onions and marinated poblano chiles. The 
soup contains cantaloupe and grapes, and the chutney is made with mangoes. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, Bender suggested a walnut torte drenched with a combination of 
melted butter and honey. 
</P>
<P>
SOPA DE MELON 
</P>
<P>
3 cups peeled, diced cantaloupe 
</P>
<P>
1 cup diced cooked potato 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
1 cup seedless green grapes, halved 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Lemon or lime slices 
</P>
<P>
Combine cantaloupe, potato and half and half in blender and blend to smooth 
puree. Stir in wine. Add orange juice, grapes and season to taste with salt. 
Chill. Serve garnished with lemon slices. Makes 8 servings.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: WHEREFORES OF WHEY'S NUTRITIONAL VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Can you give me some information about the food value of whey? I have 
been dripping nonfat yogurt to make a cheese as a substitute for butter on 
bread. The extracted whey makes a pleasant enough drink, but I want to know 
what may be lost to those in my family who don't drink it. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "Nutritive Value of American Foods -- In Common Units," U.S. Department 
of Agriculture Handbook No. 456, states one cup of fluid whey contains 64 
calories, 2.2 grams protein, 0.7 grams fat, 12.5 grams carbohydrate, 125 
milligrams calcium, 130 milligrams phosphorus, 0.2 milligrams iron, 0 
milligrams sodium, 0 milligrams potassium, 20 international units Vitamin A, 
0.07 milligrams thiamine, 0.34 milligrams riboflavin, 0.2 milligrams niacin and 
0 milligrams ascorbic acid. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Could you please tell me where I can purchase a tea cozy? 
</P>
<P>
A: Two suggestions: Tudor House, 411 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica, (213) 
451-4107, and Tottenham Court, 12206 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 
761-6560. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please explain why when I add cream to a dish to make a sauce it often 
curdles. Sometimes I substitute half and half -- is that the problem? Or is it 
related to the temperature at which the dish is being cooked? 
</P>
<P>
A: Temperature is certainly important. When you add cream to any dish cooked on 
top of the stove, it will curdle if the mixture is permitted to boil. Always 
heat dishes containing cream over a low heat, stirring often. 
</P>
<P>
A major cause of curdling in cooking milk products is cooking over too high a 
heat and for too long a time, according to authors Sylvia Rosenthal and Fran 
Shinagel in "How Cooking Works" (Macmillan, 1981). They go on to say: "There is 
also a danger of curdling if you add a milk product to an acid food. But if you 
reverse the process and add the acid food slowly to the milk, you prevent 
curdling."

THE HOME COOK: ADDING A LITTLE SPICE TO OLD-TIME SPANISH RICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Revising an old American cookbook can be a greater responsibility than anyone 
imagines. Consider, for example, the case of Spanish rice. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish rice was often found in American cookbooks of the mid-1800s; so, for 
that matter, were Indian curries. The recipes were almost always very mild 
versions of the originals, with only a dab of pepper or curry to enliven them. 
</P>
<P>
The Fannie Farmer Cookbook was no exception. When I was revising the 11th 
edition, I found that the recipe had the "blahs." Now, the first rule of 
revision is always that the dish must taste good. After that decisions are made 
as to ease of preparation, availability of ingredients and keeping the 
character of the original author's intent. There really was a Fannie Merritt 
Farmer, who published her first edition in 1896. I kept all that in mind when I 
modernized the Spanish rice recipe, but I gave it lots more flavor. 
</P>
<P>
I have just finished my second revision. And I took another look at Spanish 
rice. It is, after all, a classic of an era when American dishes were innocent, 
homey and pure. I have puzzled over what should be preserved, but I haven't 
quite resolved the question. I finally turned the manuscript in, leaving the 
last version of Spanish rice intact. 
</P>
<P>
On the horns of this dilemma I turned to one of my favorite early American 
authors, Sarah Tyson Rorer, and her book, "Mrs. Rorer's New Cookbook," 
published in 1902. Sarah Tyson was a fire-brand -- spirited, starchy and very 
opinionated. She had a far-reaching sense of food and during her time wrote 24 
popular cookbooks. She was preoccupied with how fast different foods were 
digested, and carried on a campaign in favor of rice, her favorite because of 
its quick digestion time. At the same time she railed against America's love of 
pork, which took five hours to digest. "Life," she used to advise her audiences 
"is too short to spend in digesting pork." 
</P>
<P>
Rorer was highly respected for her tasty recipes, and when I turned to her 
Spanish rice recipe and tested it, she did not disappoint me. It is very, very 
good. She did not give amounts, but she did write at the end of the recipe, "if 
this dish is properly cooked and highly seasoned, this is a very delicious 
dish." 
</P>
<P>
And it is. I wish I could use this adaptation of Rorer's recipe in my latest 
revision, but Tyson and Merritt were competitors, and Fannie Merritt would 
surely turn over in her grave. 
</P>
<P>
SARA TYSON RORER'S SPANISH RICE 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups tomatoes with juice, broken up 
</P>
<P>
3 1/2 pounds chicken pieces (thighs, legs and breast) 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
2 cups chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
1 cup long-grain rice 
</P>
<P>
Combine water, tomatoes with juice, chicken pieces, red pepper flakes and 
onions in heavy-bottomed pot with lid. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Bring to boil, cover and simmer. Let simmer 20 minutes, turn chicken pieces 
over. Add more tomato juice or water if liquid evaporates too much. 
</P>
<P>
Add parsley and rice. Stir to mix well. Cover and simmer about 15 minutes 
longer, checking once or twice to make sure liquid hasn't all been absorbed by 
rice (add more liquid if needed). Adjust to taste with salt and pepper. Serve 
hot. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
FANNIE FARMER'S SPANISH RICE 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 small green pepper, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 stalk celery, diced 
</P>
<P>
1 cup chopped mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
4 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 cup long-grain rice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
2 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
Lightly oil 2-quart casserole. Heat olive oil in skillet over medium-low heat. 
Add onion, green pepper, garlic, celery and mushrooms. Cook 5 minutes, stirring 
often. Transfer to casserole and add tomatoes, rice and pepper. Season to taste 
with salt. Stir in chicken broth. Cover and bake at 375 degrees 30 minutes. 
Stir again and bake another 30 minutes. Makes 4 servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: DDO-WA: WHERE THEY DO KOREAN DUMPLINGS RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where even the tiniest Chinese restaurant seems to serve an encyclopedic 
variety of dishes, listed on eight-page menus and supplemented by a dozen or so 
wall signs, informal Korean restaurants tend to specialize. 
</P>
<P>
Some Korean cafes in Los Angeles sell nothing but soybean gruel, and another's 
menu is pretty much limited to beef soup. There's a Korean goat restaurant on 
Olympic, some Korean-style tapas bars and many, many lunch counters where 
noodles are king. To novices, even some grand Korean banquet rooms can seem 
like specialty restaurants, where the only thing on the carte du jour is 
barbecued beef. 
</P>
<P>
Wedged into one of those doughnut-anchored mid-Wilshire mini-malls, across the 
street from a Salvadoran pupuseria and occupying a tiny storefront once home to 
a Syrian falafel stand, six-table Ddo-Wa is the kind of Korean specialty 
restaurant anybody can live with, concentrating not on fish parts or on ox 
fondue, but on that universal favorite, the dumpling. The Korean version is 
called mandoo. 
</P>
<P>
Ddo-Wa's gaudy yellow and orange exterior is identified only by a sign in 
Korean -- well, that and a picture on the mall's signboard of a boy gobbling 
mandoo -- but everybody in this extremely multiethnic community seems to have 
discovered the place. Latino office workers and burly Anglo jarheads munch on 
dumplings as greedily as the gaggles of schoolgirls from the massive 
synagogue-turned-Korean Presbyterian church down the street. Stroller-pushing 
women stagger away under the weight of huge take-out orders. 
</P>
<P>
The menu here is simplicity itself: steamed, boiled, fried or in soup. If 
that's too complicated, a photograph of each dish is displayed on the rear 
wall. For the nearsighted, individual picture menus are available. 
</P>
<P>
When you sit down, you are served a lagniappe of yellow pickled daikon, or 
perhaps a little plate of kimchi. The beverage of choice seems to be tap water, 
poured into a plastic cup, or nothing more exotic than 7-Up. 
</P>
<P>
As you'd expect, though, the mandoo -- sort of D-battery-size variants on the 
meat-filled Chinese potsticker, amped up with garlic and herbs -- are 
wonderful, plump and savory. When you bite down into the crisp skin of a fried 
dumpling, hot juice spurts across the table, and you burn your tongue. The 
boiled dumplings are soft, definitely spoon food, better enjoyed with the 
milky-white beef broth and bits of seaweed in the dumpling soup. 
</P>
<P>
The steamed are firm, a little chewy maybe, and even more delicious dipped in a 
tincture of vinegar, soy and powdered cayenne. (Once, as a prank, somebody had 
unscrewed the lid on the cayenne shaker, and the whole thing poured out onto my 
plate. Six months later, I think the people who work there may have finally 
stopped snickering.) 
</P>
<P>
Though an order of any of these is enough for a light meal, you can follow your 
dumplings with some fried cuttlefish, kind of like greasy Korean calamari, or 
else there's Korean sushi, which is a seaweed-wrapped sushi roll stuffed with 
fish cake and Korean pickles. The sugary, Korean-style grilled short ribs with 
rice aren't great (this is a specialty restaurant), but there is a pretty good 
$6.75 combination platter that gives you a little taste of everything in a big 
wooden tray. 
</P>
<P>
But the best thing in the restaurant, better than the dumplings even, is 
something Ddo-Wa calls rice cake -- rice noodles, thick as a finger, with fish 
cake and fried vegetables in a chile-red miso sauce, as hot and sweet as . . . 
well, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 Ddo-Wa Restaurant, 3542 W. Third St., Los Angeles, (213) 387-1288. Open Monday 
through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Lot parking. Takeout. Cash only. Lunch for 
two, food only, $8-$13.50.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: HOW OLD IS YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're just as young as you feel -- but how old is your GI tract? You know time 
is starting to catch up with you if you sit down to a bowl of Texas chili or a 
spicy Sichuan dish and find yourself wondering whether you're going to pay a 
price for it later. 
</P>
<P>
As we get on in years, it makes sense to take into account the regions of our 
body. The gastrointestinal tract (from mouth on down through the stomach and 
intestines) is charged with such critical physiological functions as food 
intake, digestion, absorption, excretion and disposal of toxic substances. All 
of us age differently, but all aging GI tracts have elements in common, some 
tied to the general process of aging itself. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, connective tissues grow smaller, thinner or less resilient. The 
immune system weakens, and the body produces fewer antibodies to foreign 
substances but more to its own secretions. Environmental assaults such as 
smoking, alcohol, long-term poor nutrition and overdoses of medication 
contribute to the erosion. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the gastrointestinal tract, let's begin where the food begins, 
in the mouth. Contrary to what you might have heard, neither saliva nor taste 
buds appear to decline with age. But ease of swallowing may be slightly 
affected. Within the stomach, gastric-acid secretion does decrease as we grow 
old. This cutback is linked to a rise in stomach conditions ranging from mild 
gastritis to gastric atrophy. In the last 20 years, the incidence of peptic or 
gastric (stomach) ulcers has fallen in every group except the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Often there are no symptoms until hemorrhaging shows up as blood in the stool 
or vomit, or the ulcer perforates the stomach wall. One controversial suspect 
is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs taken for arthritis and other chronic 
pain. At least 25% of upper GI bleeding in elderly patients is associated with 
use of these drugs, and the corresponding mortality rate is 10% or higher. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible culprit is a supposedly benign intestinal bacterium called 
Helicobacter pylori, the prevalence of which rises with age. It has been 
isolated in the stomachs of 80% of elderly patients and is strongly correlated 
with the appearance of gastric ulcers. But before we can understand what to do 
about the presence of these bacteria, more research is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Farther down the aging gastrointestinal tract lie other hazards. Gallstones, 
predominantly cholesterol stones, are more prevalent in women than in men. The 
liver, which serves as a clearinghouse for drugs and other potentially toxic 
substances, shows the wear and tear of time by working less efficiently. In 
addition, since the immune system runs less smoothly, liver infections such as 
hepatitis B can be more serious and prolonged than in younger people. 
Nevertheless, physicians treating elderly people need to exercise caution in 
drug dosages. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, we can't turn back time, and there's no way to prevent all these 
conditions. But through certain habitual precautions we can prevent some and 
delay others. Step one is a good diet and vigorous, regular exercise. 
High-calorie nutrients such as the simple sugars should take a back seat to 
cereals, grains, fruits, vegetables and low-fat meats and dairy products. This 
healthy diet is also rich in fiber, which promotes bowel regularity. Regular 
physical exercise also encourages regularity, as well as exerting other 
protective influences. 
</P>
<P>
Step two is to monitor intake of drugs. If you're one of those people who tends 
to collect a mini-pharmacy, throw out everything but current prescriptions and 
over-the-counter drugs recommended by a doctor. Take prescription drugs only as 
long as directed and other drugs only when absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The third and final measure is to have regular checkups that help catch 
problems while still minor. Don't be shy in telling a doctor about mild 
physical changes that may be signposts for other conditions. And visit a 
dentist regularly too. Sound teeth are important to healthy eating, and the 
oral cavity is a sensitive guide to what's happening elsewhere in the body. 
</P>
<P>
Just as a highway that's been neglected for years will make for dangerous 
driving, so the GI tract will suffer from lack of upkeep. Do yourself a favor 
now and avoid problems down the road. If we must age, let us also grow wise -- 
and use the wisdom to maintain good health.

</P>

When the National Academy of Sciences recommended, in a report published last 
week, that pregnant women avoid multivitamin supplements and instead get the 
extra nutrients they need from a balanced diet, it came as a great surprise to 
many women. 
</P>
<P>
Some said they would agree to consult with their physicians but believed 
supplements were necessary as insurance. Others said they would outright refuse 
to heed the advice, which they viewed as "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"I take a prenatal vitamin, plus extra calcium and iron supplements," said 
Aimee Oswald, a medical receptionist whose baby is due in November, "because 
sometimes you can't eat all the right foods. When you're sick you have to eat 
what looks good to you. . .sometimes I have a hard time just getting crackers 
down. I refuse to give mine (vitamins) up. I need them." 
</P>
<P>
This reaction to the recommendations of the 11-member panel of medical and 
nutrition experts and an auxiliary committee of specialists is not unusual. 
Since obstetricians commonly prescribe prenatal vitamins to expectant mothers 
to ensure nutritional adequacy, many people believe the pills are essential for 
delivery of a healthy baby. 
</P>
<P>
Some research has even shown that those women who take multivitamin supplements 
containing folic acid around the time of conception have a reduced chance of 
having a baby with a defect of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida. 
</P>
<P>
This birth defect, also called a neural tube defect, occurs when the neural 
tube, a pre-embryonic structure that develops into the spine and the brain 
during the third and fourth week of pregnancy, fails to close completely. 
</P>
<P>
It effects an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 newborns each year. And although there 
is no known exact cause, experts believe the mother's nutritional status and 
other environmental factors may interact with her genetic predisposition and 
increase risk for the defect. 
</P>
<P>
But lacking sufficient evidence of a direct link, the government committee 
concluded that, "there is not enough evidence to recommend a folic acid 
supplement to all women of child-bearing age." 
</P>
<P>
It is known that folic acid has a role in development of red blood cells and 
genetic material in body cells. Anemia can even result when folic acid intake 
is inadequate. During pregnancy the requirement for folic acid (also known as 
folate and folacin) does increase, but the question of supplementation to 
reduce risk for birth defects is "quite a different issue," according to the 
chairman of the government committee. 
</P>
<P>
"In the ordinary clinical sense the neural tube defect has occured almost by 
the time that a woman is aware that she is pregnant," said Dr. Roy Pitkin, 
department of obstetrics and gynecology at the UCLA School of Medicine, who 
chaired the committee. "If she waits until she knows (she is pregnant) to 
institute vitamin therapy -- even if it is effective -- then it will be too 
late. All of these studies that have examined (the connection) have involved 
women who were already taking multivitamins before conception." 
</P>
<P>
The panel did, however, call for studies to determine a relationship between 
multivitamin supplements and birth defects. The Spina Bifida Assn. of America 
last week also made this recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Until all the data is in, the committee said that careful menu planning can 
help achieve achieve adequate nourishment for mother and fetus through diet. 
Food is the preferred source of folic acid and many other nutrients -- except 
iron -- the committee said because most women typically fail to meet the 
Recommended Dietary Allowance through diet. A low-dose ferrous iron supplement 
of 30 milligrams is suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Women of child-bearing age are encouraged to eat "adequate" amounts of fruits, 
vegetables, whole grains and legumes -- all good sources of folate. A new U.S. 
Department of Agriculture publication can explain just how much is "adequate." 
</P>
<P>
"Good Sources of Nutrients," lists the top sources of 16 vitamins and minerals 
and dietary fiber -- and both folic acid and iron are among them. It also gives 
information on how to prepare and store foods to avoid nutrient loss, explains 
serving sizes and tells why each vitamin or mineral is important. 
</P>
<P>
"This information will help consumers select a variety of foods that provide 
the vitamins, minerals and fiber they need," said Sue Ann Ritchko, 
administrator of the USDA's Human Nutrition Information Service. 
</P>
<P>
Since folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, it is easily destroyed during 
preparation, cooking and storage, so fruits and vegetables should be served raw 
whenever possible. Or, they can be steamed, boiled or simmered in a minimal 
amount of liquid. Store vegetables in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some good sources of folic acid according to the USDA. Raw forms of 
some vegetables are not included, because in their raw state they don't contain 
enough folic acid. For example, a 1/2-cup cooked serving of beets contains more 
than the same amount of the vegetable raw. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the term "good source" is based on the RDA of 400 micrograms daily for a 
pregnant woman. Desirable intakes for women, men and children, which are less, 
would be about half. 
</P>
<P>
The following foods supply 40% of the RDA: three ounces braised beef or calf 
liver, 1/2 cup cooked black-eyed peas or 1/2 cup cooked lentils. 
</P>
<P>
The following foods supply 25 to 29% of the RDA: one ounce fortified 
ready-to-eat cereal -- depending upon the brand (check the label), 1/2 cup 
cooked spinach, three ounces pork or 1/2 cup cooked red kidney beans. 
</P>
<P>
The following foods supply 10 to 24% of the RDA: one whole-wheat English 
muffin; one small whole-wheat pita-bread round; two tablespoons plain wheat 
germ; 3/4 cup grapefruit and orange juice frozen, reconstituted; 3/4 cup fresh 
or frozen reconstituted orange juice; one medium artichoke cooked; 1/2 cup 
cooked asparagus, beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, Chinese 
cabbage, cream-style corn, mustard greens, okra, parsnips, green peas, spinach 
or turnip greens; one cup raw endive, chicory, escarole, romaine or spinach; 
three ounces steamed crab meat; 1/2 cup cooked bayo, black, brown, calico, 
garbanzo, lima, Mexican, pinto, white beans or split yellow or green peas. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA package also includes fact sheets on Vitamins A, E, C, B-6, B-12, 
thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, magnesium, copper, zinc, 
phosphorous, potassium and dietary fiber. 
</P>
<P>
"Good Sources of Nutrients" may be obtained by writing to: Consumer Information 
Center, Pueblo Colo. 81009. When ordering, include the item number 171W and a 
check or money order for $5 payable to the "Superintendent of Documents."

PRETTY PRODUCE IS UNDER FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: PENDING LEGISLATION DISCOURAGES USE OF PESTICIDES IN OBTAINING 
FLAWLESS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The practice of using agricultural chemicals to obtain cosmetically perfect 
produce came under fire in Congress last week in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Agriculture committee approved a reform package that would require a 
modification of federal grading standards that currently rewards farmers for 
producing flawless fruit and vegetables. Often this commercially desirable 
appearance is the indirect result of pesticide usage. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, entitled the Agricultural Marketing Reform Act of 1990, was 
introduced by Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr. (D -- Ga.) and is a portion of the 1990 
Farm Bill. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the vote was mixed. Industry trade associations remain opposed to 
the measure while consumer groups praised its passage in committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Both consumers and farmers win with this important change in grading 
standards," said Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and 
Health Policy, a Washington-based advocacy group. "Consumers will have the 
opportunity to buy nutritious and wholesome produce which has less pesticide 
residues. Farmers can (also) cut back on costly pesticide use and increase the 
markets for their produce." 
</P>
<P>
Haas estimated that between 10% to 20% of the chemicals used on produce are 
applied in hopes of maintaining cosmetic qualities. 
</P>
<P>
A produce industry spokesman said that the Fowler Amendment was "unacceptable" 
and that its very premise was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things seriously wrong with the bill," said John McClung, a 
vice president for United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn. in Alexandria, Va. 
"(The measure) subjects us to the criticism that we use pesticides for purely 
cosmetic purposes . . . Well, there is no way a pesticide can enhance a given 
piece of fruit or vegetable. We can't make something attractive that isn't 
attractive." 
</P>
<P>
McClung said there are no pesticides approved for use in this country simply 
for cosmetic purposes. The waxes applied to some thin-skinned items in order to 
retain moisture could be considered cosmetic compounds, he said, but this 
category was not addressed in the Fowler Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
However, McClung did acknowledge that pesticides, by controlling insects, do 
prevent scarring or stress on produce that may be otherwise caused by the 
pests. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about using farm chemicals to improve the appearance of produce have 
been raised for some time. In a 1989 report on Alternative Agriculture, for 
instance, the National Research Council stated that U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's regulations actually encouraged and rewarded chemical 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
"Federally approved grading standards and marketing orders for fruits and 
vegetables usually allow few surface blemishes on fresh produce," according to 
the council, which is a principal agency of the National Academy of Sciences. 
"Consequently, farmers use more pesticides to meet these standards (in order 
to) guarantee receipt of a top price . . . Cosmetic standards, however, often 
have no relation to nutritional quality, flavor or food safety. Furthermore, 
these standards discourage alternative pest control practices that may not be 
as effective in meeting their rigid criteria." 
</P>
<P>
However, industry groups believe that improved visual appearances have helped 
increase produce sales dramatically during the past few decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Food Technologists recently issued a report entitled the 
"Quality of Fruits and Vegetables." In the study, the Chicago-based group 
maintains that a reduction in chemical usage may actually hurt produce's 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"Visual quality may suffer in foods that have not been treated with 
pesticides," says the report. "Consumers may not be willing to accept lower 
standards for bruising, off-color or even unseen insect parts if that's the 
price for a decrease in pesticide usage." 
</P>
<P>
Shopping behavior, or actual consumer purchases, have not necessarily followed 
heightened public concerns about pesticide residue in foods. In fact, a 
Sacramento-based supermarket chain -- Raley's -- recently discontinued offering 
organically grown produce because sales were sluggish at best. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Food Technologists discussed this point, as well, in its 
recent report. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers want fresh products that are -- besides visually appealing -- 
nutritious, convenient, available year round, reasonably priced, yet totally 
free of . . . pesticides. Currently, shoppers can't have one without excluding 
the other," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Polling data provided by Public Voice indicated that, once educated on the 
subject, consumers are willing to accept produce with blemishes, if it means a 
corresponding reduction in chemical residues. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the entire Farm Bill, including the Fowler 
Amendment, sometime early next month, according to Congressional observers.

DEAR SOS: Some years ago The Times Sunday magazine section published a recipe 
for tea scones, using self-rising flour. I have misplaced the recipe and would 
be grateful for a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARGARET 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MARGARET: According to the accompanying article back in 1988, the recipe 
came from Mamie Meechan of Edinburgh, who prepares the scones whenever she 
visits her daughter in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
AFTERNOON TEA SCONES 
</P>
<P>
2 cups self-rising flour 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
Place flour in large bowl. Cut in butter with fork or pastry cutter until 
mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in sugar. Beat egg and milk together with 
whisk. Gradually and lightly stir in all but 1 tablespoon of liquid to obtain 
soft dough. 
</P>
<P>
Turn out onto floured board and lightly pat dough into a round, handling as 
little as possible. With floured rolling pin, roll dough to about 3/4-inch 
thickness. Cut into 2-inch round with biscuit cutter. (If pastry sticks to 
cutter, dip cutter in flour.) 
</P>
<P>
Place rounds 1 inch apart on lightly greased baking sheet. Press trimmings 
together lightly and reroll to cut more rounds. Brush tops of scones with 
remaining 1 tablespoon egg and milk mixture. Bake at 450 degrees 10 to 12 
minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire rack. Serve with butter and 
raspberry jam. Makes 12 scones.

JUSTICE IN SAN DIEGO NEAR COLLAPSE, PROSECUTOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Atty. John Witt on Wednesday said that his department's criminal 
prosecution division is "in jeopardy of collapsing" because of budget cuts that 
are forcing the office to forgo hundreds of misdemeanor criminal cases each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
He said those cases, which involve drug and alcohol violations, vandalism, 
robbery, trespassing and domestic violence, are strong enough legally to be 
prosecuted in court, but are rejected solely because there aren't enough 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The growing inability to prosecute misdemeanors is most graphic in cases of 
domestic violence, Witt said. Because of manpower shortages, the 2-year-old 
division's four attorneys are unable to prosecute about half of the new 
domestic violence cases that surface each month. In recent months, that meant 
"rejecting 50% of all incoming spousal abuse cases without any prosecution or 
follow-up," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going nuts" trying to deal with the caseload, said Casey Gwinn, head 
attorney in the domestic violence unit. While other budgets in the city have 
grown slightly during the last several years, the city attorney "is cutting 
back (on misdemeanor prosecutions) to maintain serious crimes at the top of the 
heap. We've watched everything suffer." 
</P>
<P>
The number of cases not going to trial would increase dramatically if the San 
Diego City Council adopts the budget proposed for the fiscal year beginning 
July 1, Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, I have not been an alarmist, but public safety is at stake," 
Witt said during a Wednesday press conference at City Hall. "Few departments in 
the city of San Diego are more central to public safety . . . yet our budget 
needs continue to go unfunded." 
</P>
<P>
Witt on Wednesday joined the growing chorus of city department heads demanding 
that the council increase their budgets. Those funding pleas began shortly 
after the council tentatively agreed to freeze budgets at their current levels, 
an action that, because of inflation and salary increases, would force service 
levels to drop. 
</P>
<P>
But Witt said Wednesday that the proposed freeze would dramatically reduce his 
office's ability to prosecute serious misdemeanor crimes because the manpower 
shortage "has really grown bad" over the last two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
The council's current budget would freeze Witt's departmental spending at $12.8 
million during the next fiscal year. Witt said Wednesday that he needs $2.7 
million more than that to to keep prosecutions from sliding further. 
</P>
<P>
The 98 attorneys in Witt's department handle legal affairs for the city as well 
as prosecuting misdemeanor crimes that are committed in the city. Misdemeanors 
range from relatively mundane traffic violations to "real crimes, serious 
crimes committed by real criminals -- child abusers, wife beaters, drug users, 
prostitutes, drunk drivers, con men, (and) slumlords," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's concerns were outlined in a pair of recent memorandums written by Deputy 
City Atty. Mary T. Nuesca, whose unit determines which misdemeanor cases go to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
In those reports, obtained by The Times on Wednesday, Nuesca described a 
criminal justice system that, because of manpower shortages, is failing to 
provide citizens with basic services. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to prioritize the type of crimes were going to (prosecute) but the 
list of what we're not going to do keeps growing," Nuesca said in an interview. 
"It was in crisis proportion back in April . . . since then it's only gotten 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the manpower shortage, "most vandalisms and battery cases are 
rejected even though they are both legally and trial sufficient," Nuesca wrote 
in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Nuesca said the city attorney's office also lacks the manpower to ensure that 
defendants show up for arraignments. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, we punish those who show up for court," Nuesca wrote. "Those who 
do not, those who rip up their (citations), who continually fail to appear for 
court, are rewarded for their ongoing criminal behavior by a lack of 
prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
"It will not be long until we reject a case where prosecution might have 
prevented a more serious harm, but instead we rejected the case for 'budget' 
reasons," Nuesca wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to try and decide which case is a ticking time bomb" and go to trial 
on those, said Gretchen North, Nuesca's supervisor in the criminal division's 
screening and arraignment unit. "That terrifies us. There are good triable 
cases, and we are not able to prosecute." 
</P>
<P>
Nuesca, in the memorandums and in an interview, described a system in which: 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are hamstrung by an inability to properly screen cases before 
appearing in arraignments. Although the city attorney historically has not 
screened paper work for routine traffic cases and some municipal code 
violations, in the last six months the department has stopped screening some 
trespass, prostitution, petty theft and drug paraphernalia cases. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that, if the case is not perfect at arraignment . . . if a page of 
the police report is missing, we do not have the opportunity to request the 
missing page from the Police Department," Nuesca wrote. "We must dismiss the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Manpower shortages force prosecutors to plea-bargain cases that ordinarily 
would go to trial. "It's a very strange way to do business," Nuesca said. "I'm 
not at all happy with it. . . . But, when someone calls in sick, we might end 
up with two deputy attorneys and 20 courtrooms. You end up having to 
plea-bargain." 
</P>
<P>
Plea bargains also occur when attorneys, who are unable to pre-screen records, 
fail to uncover previous records of some defendants, Nuesca said. "Because 
these cases are not screened, the career criminal can come to arraignment court 
and receive the same treatment/punishment as a first-time offender," Nuesca 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively young attorneys are "being asked to do some of the toughest, 
on-the-spot screening in court," Nuesca wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions on which cases get tried are increasingly driven by whether or not 
the case will move speedily. "If drug case A triggers more paper work than drug 
case B, case A isn't going to get prosecuted," Nuesca said. 
</P>
<P>
Victims who seek criminal justice through the city attorney's office 
increasingly are being left to civil remedies. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend most of my time on the telephone with victims, explaining why we 
rejected their case," Nuesca said. "I tell them we don't have any money, and 
they say that they pay their taxes. . . . They have no idea (about) the state 
of the criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of DUI cases, U.S. Navy personnel facing misdemeanor charges 
are now tried by the military justice system. Traditionally, the military 
system tried only those cases that occurred on military bases. Similarly, the 
city attorney has asked the San Diego State University judicial discipline 
office to handle all but the most serious misdemeanor cases that occur on that 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Although many lesser misdemeanors are not being tried, the city attorney is 
still prosecuting cases involving diving under the influence or weapons, and 
cases that the district attorney downgrades from felonies to misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine that we'd stop doing DUI or weapons," Nuesca said. "You might 
as well fold us down completely." 
</P>
<P>
Witt on Wednesday acknowledged that, even if his department were to be 
adequately funded, the city is not able to properly deal with misdemeanor 
crimes because the city lacks a jail to house people who are arrested on 
misdemeanor charges. "The criminal justice system is in terrible shape," Witt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is seeking the money to build a misdemeanor detention facility at Otay 
Mesa.

BURGREEN VOWS POLICE BEEF-UP ALONG BORDER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: VIOLENCE AGAINST ILLEGAL CROSSERS PROMPTS PROMISE OF MORE PATROLS, BUT 
SOME ACTIVISTS WORRY THAT THE MOVE MAY AGGRAVATE THE PERILS.

Alarmed by rising violence against undocumented immigrants, San Diego Police 
Chief Bob Burgreen said Wednesday that patrols will be stepped up in the 
dangerous border strip, and that officers may once again be posted to hazardous 
night duty in the rugged terrain favored by clandestine border crossers. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen, in comments made before a group of Tijuana journalists and during a 
telephone interview, also said that police hope to coordinate border operations 
with Mexican authorities. He said police are also contemplating the revival of 
a controversial anti-crime squad consisting of San Diego officers and U.S. 
Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
"That area is increasingly becoming violent, and I feel that steps must be 
taken to make the area safe," said Burgreen. He gave no timetable for the 
police beef-up, although he indicated it will be soon. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to involve putting more officers in the canyons, having more 
activities at night and having more officers involved in dangerous shooting 
situations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crime against clandestine border crossers has long been a thorny issue for San 
Diego police, who say the problem, with its international ramifications, 
represents a law enforcement dilemma unique in the nation. The people being 
victimized -- among the thousands who enter San Diego each day from Tijuana 
without visas -- are themselves lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Burgreen said, the lawlessness of the canyon-riddled border 
strip has reached a new high, as criminals emboldened by the lack of police 
presence have 
</P>
<P>
had almost free reign to terrorize migrants. 
</P>
<P>
A six-person special police unit now patrols the area, but Burgreen said the 
squad is a high-profile outfit that mostly attempts to deter crime by being 
visible and to investigate wrongdoing in the aftermath of specific criminal 
activity. Police are contemplating a more "pro-active" squad that would 
actively seek out lawbreakers and conduct more night patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"When our cops are in the canyons, the crooks go away," Burgreen asserted. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that there is a "high likelihood" that more police officers 
deployed in the border zone will get into shoot-outs with suspected thieves, 
and that rights activists and others will criticize the department's actions. 
But the chief said it is necessary to increase patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to get get shot, maybe even killed," Burgreen said, 
explaining that the only question is who the victims will be. "Should it be 
border bandits getting shot and killed, or innocent people getting shot and 
killed by border bandits?" 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen did rule out as too dangerous the reintroduction of an undercover 
anti-crime squad, similar to the San Diego police outfit whose exploits from 
1976 to 1978 were chronicled by Joseph Wambaugh in his book Lines and Shadows. 
Such undercover work, in which officers pose as border crossers, is too 
hazardous, Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, statistics show, seven undocumented people have been slain in the 
border zone, all killed in the heavily trafficked rugged area to the west of 
the giant port of entry at San Ysidro. There were only five such killings in 
all of 1989, police say. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent cases, the bodies of two men, both shooting victims, were 
found June 6 in an open area to the southwest of the intersection of Monument 
and Dairy Mart roads in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves are blamed for most of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, smugglers, vendors and undocumented border crossers who 
regularly work in the border strip have stated in interviews that they would 
favor a greater San Diego police presence in the zone. Fear of assaults by 
bajadores, as the thieves are widely known, is a prevalent emotion these days 
among undocumented border crossers. 
</P>
<P>
However, immigrant rights activists have expressed wariness of a beefed-up 
police presence along the border. They fear that officers may shoot more 
innocent people than thieves will. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be more protection for the migrants, but having the police there 
shooting people may only exacerbate the situation," said Roberto Martinez, a 
San Diego activist affiliated with a Quaker rights group. He said his group and 
others are seeking alternatives, though none have emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a revived joint effort involving the police and Border Patrol is 
particularly troubling to Martinez and other critics. The former squad, known 
as the Border Crime Prevention Unit, shot 44 suspects during its five-year 
existence, killing 18. The outfit was disbanded in January, 1989, after 
shooting and killing four suspects during a two-week period. All of those 
killed were thieves who attempted to rob officers, mistaking them in the 
darkness for undocumented border crossers, according to police accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Burgreen said he will discuss the idea of a new joint squad with Gustavo 
de la Vina, the new chief Border Patrol agent in San Diego, who is scheduled to 
take office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen also said that he favors more joint efforts with Mexican police. Such 
operations have been employed before in the border zone, but the tactics have 
raised considerable opposition in Mexico, where cooperation was widely viewed 
as abetting the perceived anti-immigrant agenda of U.S. authorities.

FIRMS, AGENCIES JOIN IN DRIVE TO FIND CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than a dozen Ventura County companies and public agencies have formally 
joined forces in a drive to provide better day-care services for their 
employees, although most are stopping short of actually opening children's 
centers in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
One major focus of the consortium, whose first formal meeting was held 
Wednesday night at the Ventura Holiday Inn, is to locate and upgrade private 
day-care providers countywide. 
</P>
<P>
The companies, which will pool information on available day-care services, also 
will try to zero in on facilities that care for children who are ill -- a 
service that working parents find particularly difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Coleman, project coordinator for the Ventura Child Care Consortium, said 
most of the companies are too small to establish day-care programs on their 
premises, but have joined forces to improve day-care options outside the 
business place. 
</P>
<P>
A leading member of the coalition is Patagonia, a Ventura outdoor clothing 
business with a national reputation as a leader in providing day-care 
facilities for its workers. 
</P>
<P>
As the consortium launched its countywide effort, another member company 
announced Wednesday that it plans to follow Patagonia's lead by building its 
own on-site children's center when it moves later this year from midtown 
Ventura to the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
The company, Western Instrument Corp., which has 130 employees, said it hopes 
to join forces with Patagonia in the actual operation of the new center. 
</P>
<P>
Formal contracts have not been signed, but Jean Halsell, Western Instrument's 
administration manager, said she is hopeful that the child-care partnership 
will be formed and that Anita Garaway, director of Patagonia's Great Pacific 
Child Development Center, will head both schools. 
</P>
<P>
Halsell said discussions have been held about placing the younger children of 
employees of both companies at Patagonia and older children at the proposed 
Western Instrument facility. The companies and the children's parents would 
share the cost of operating the centers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Halsell said Western Instrument, an ocean engineering firm, plans to move in 
late summer or early fall to the site of the former Mill Elementary School on 
Ventura Avenue. The company's new children's facility will open six to nine 
months later, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tebbel, a Patagonia spokesman, said it is too soon to consider the deal 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Henning Ottsen, Western Instrument's vice president, said, "We'd like very much 
to get the benefit of Patagonia's expertise, but we're definitely going to open 
an on-site center whether or not we reach an agreement with them." 
</P>
<P>
According to Coleman, a child-care partnership between the two companies would 
be an ideal example of what is needed in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a slow-growth area, but we're still making children," Coleman said. 
She suggested that because the county's employers are relatively small, their 
assistance to working parents must be innovative rather than costly. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen employers -- holdovers from the 65 that were represented at a 
symposium in April -- signed up as founding members of the consortium. Coleman 
said another 40 employers are interested in working with the group. 
</P>
<P>
The founding members include American Commercial Bank, Bank of A. Levy, First 
Interstate Bank, GTE California, J.C. Penney, Patagonia, Pemko Manufacturing, 
Pyramid Employment Agency, Turning Point Foundation, Ventura County National 
Bank and Western Instrument. Ventura County and Oxnard College are also 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our first responsibilities as we move into our second year is to draw 
those other 40 in," said James W. Word, manager of the J.C. Penney store in 
Ventura's Buenaventura Plaza. He was a member of the Blue Ribbon Committee that 
guided the child-care campaign through its first year.

THE DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
LEAKING POOL, THIRSTY TREES BOTH FALL VICTIM

Ventura faced up to the grim realities of its severe water shortage Wednesday 
when school officials announced they will close a leaking swimming pool, and 
city officials inspecting dying trees in Grant Park said there was nothing they 
could do to save them. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they will close the Ventura High School pool today 
because a large crack in the concrete pool shell is allowing about 1,500 
gallons of water a day to leak. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept it open for as long as we could, but the drought is forcing us to 
close it," said Gary Mortimer, director of facilities for the Ventura Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had cited the school Tuesday for violating Ventura's water-waste 
ordinance, but the pool was allowed to remain open until today -- the year's 
last school day -- so that swimming classes would not be disrupted. The 1989 
ordinance sets penalties for unnecessary water use. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 youngsters and adults who take part each summer in city-sponsored 
swimming programs at the school will be left hanging out to dry. And unless 
repairs are made before the fall, the closure will affect more than 1,000 
students who regularly enroll in swimming classes. It is the only pool 
available to the public in the west end of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The pool needs at least $250,000 worth of repairs before it can be reopened, 
and school officials said they have yet to decide whether to fix it or build a 
new one, which would cost more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pool users were not the only ones made aware Wednesday of the consequences of 
living in drought-stricken Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Self-proclaimed tree lover Bob Piros has been crusading to save Grant Park's 
pines and oaks since the drought began. Piros, 44, hauls about 16 gallons of 
water in the back seat of his car to irrigate the smaller pines along Brakey 
Road in Grant Park at least three times a week. But the bigger trees around 
them are slowly dying of thirst, so Piros asked the City Council last month to 
help him save them. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't get any help. Instead, City Manager John Baker told Piros at a 
June 4 council meeting that the city was having enough trouble keeping 
landscaped areas from drying out with the little water they had available. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Piros turned to Councilman Gary Tuttle, who set up a Wednesday 
morning meeting at Grant Park with himself, Piros, city arborist Jerry Revard 
and officials from the city Parks and Recreation Department to look into the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
They met by Brakey Road at the foot of a barren yellow hillside that until 
recently was green and covered with pines. They all agreed that the trees were 
dying of thirst, but none could come up with any solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is the water going to come from?" asked Jim Walker, a Parks and 
Recreation official. "We are still trying to meet our mandatory 20% water 
reduction, but we're not even there yet," he said, referring to the city's 
mandatory conservation ordinance enacted in April. 
</P>
<P>
At least 24 trees have died from lack of water since April, and things could 
get worse before they get better, Parks and Recreation Director Barbara 
Harrison said. "It hurts us just as much as it hurts you," Harrison told Piros. 
"Our job is to take care of parks." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle said he would look into the possibility of using reclaimed water for the 
trees. Piros seemed heartbroken but hopeful that a few trees would be saved.

BRACING FOR AN ORDEAL; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES TO ENDURE NEW TRIAL ORDERED FOR DRUNK DRIVER IN 3 DEATHS 
</P>

<P>
A year ago today, Linda Oxenreider wept in a Ventura County courtroom as her 
son's violent death in a traffic accident was recounted. 
</P>
<P>
The family of Diane Mannes was there too, listening as witnesses described her 
as a murderer who drunkenly mowed down five young men, killing three of them. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, as Mannes was bound over for retrial on a new set of 
second-degree murder charges, both families were back in court, sharing the 
same front row, reliving the night of March 31, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll come every day," said Linda Oxenreider, who attended every session of 
Mannes' first trial last November. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes' father, her boyfriend and several other family members sat behind the 
defendant, who was dressed in blue jail clothes. They declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was convicted of two felony drunk driving charges and was sentenced to 
four years in prison last year, but the jury deadlocked on the second-degree 
murder charges that the district attorney's office had filed. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than accept the initial verdict, the district attorney's office decided 
to retry Mannes on second-degree murder charges, a decision supported by the 
victims' families, Linda Oxenreider said. 
</P>
<P>
"What she did to us is absolutely the worst thing you can do to another person 
-- kill their child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
What Mannes did, according to witnesses at her preliminary hearing Wednesday 
and at the first trial, was drink a considerable amount of vodka before driving 
a 1984 Ford Bronco down the broad S-curves of the Conejo Grade on the 
northbound Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxenreiders' son Joshua, 19, and four of his friends were walking along the 
shoulder of the highway after having a flat tire. They were about 40 feet from 
their disabled car when Mannes sideswiped it and plowed into the group, fatally 
injuring Jacob Boyd, 14, of Camarillo; Scott Mullins, 20, of Mansfield, Ohio, 
and Joshua Oxenreider. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob's brother, Jeremy Boyd, 19 at the time, and Jeffrey Botens, then 15, both 
of Camarillo, were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling yellow tissues from her purse, Linda Oxenreider cried quietly as 
Municipal Judge John J. Hunter recited some of the facts agreed to by both 
sides in the case: that Mannes had killed the three men with her car; that her 
blood-alcohol level was 0.20%; that 43 hours before the accident, Mannes had 
been arrested in Tarzana on suspicion of drunk driving with a blood alcohol 
level of 0.26%; that in 1983 Mannes was convicted of driving under the 
influence in Los Angeles with a 0.34% blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
"It fills me with a great deal of rage," Linda Oxenreider said during a break. 
"All this because of the selfishness of one woman." 
</P>
<P>
Mannes' boyfriend, David Pena, testified Wednesday that he had known her to 
drink only one other time in their five-year relationship. After her drunk 
driving arrest in the Valley the day before the accident, Mannes told him that 
she drank because she was upset about long-simmering family matters, Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes' lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Robert Dahlstedt, who unsuccessfully 
tried to block a second trial on grounds that it would constitute double 
jeopardy, said in an interview that Mannes suffers from depression and drank 
sometimes to obliterate her feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The only other witness Wednesday was Tony Dunn, 22, of Simi Valley. Dunn was 
with the youths who were hit but escaped injury because he was on the other 
side of the guardrail.

Linda Oxenreider winced as Dunn told of hearing a "smash" of one car hitting 
another and of seeing the Bronco scraping along the pavement, upside down. Dunn 
climbed over the guardrail, he said, and found all of his friends lying on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
To get a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutor Donald Glynn must prove 
not only that Mannes killed the youths, but that her drunken condition 
constituted malice. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlstedt argued that the California Supreme Court has ruled that malice exists 
in such cases only if there is a high probability that the act will result in 
death. He noted that the Ventura court sees thousands of drunk drivers each 
year but only a few cases in which a death is involved. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, however, said the higher a driver's blood alcohol level, the higher the 
probability that death will result. Citing Mannes' prior cases of drunk driving 
and a program she attended, he said she was well aware of the dangers of drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter scheduled arraignment for June 21. Dahlstedt said the trial should start 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney said a second trial could have been avoided. "We would 
plead guilty to vehicular manslaughter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That charge would result in a maximum term of about 14 years, he said, 
including the prison time already ordered. He said the maximum sentence she 
could receive for three second-degree murder convictions would be 45 years to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlstedt said Mannes "knows she has affected a lot of lives." 
</P>
<P>
"If it was left to her, she would probably say she should be punished as a 
murderer."

RAZING OF HOUSES FOR I-15 TO BE SPEEDED

State officials plan to accelerate demolition of abandoned houses in a city 
neighborhood after community residents complained that the houses have become 
havens for drug dealers and targets for arsonists and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
California Department of Transportation officials announced Wednesday that they 
plan to demolish 18 to 22 houses the state owns near 40th Street before July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has been purchasing properties in the area to build a 2.2-mile stretch 
of Interstate 15 that would run parallel to 40th Street between Interstate 805 
and Interstate 8. But some area residents say the houses have become eyesores. 
</P>
<P>
"They give the whole community a sense of blight," said Frank Gormlie, a 
community organizer for the City Heights Community Development Corp. "You think 
sometimes you're in Beirut or the Bronx or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
The abandoned houses have become popular hangouts for drug dealers and 
transients, Gormlie said. 
</P>
<P>
Transients are believed to have caused two fires in two of the houses last 
month, said Steve Saville, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Saville said the demolition is being accelerated with the cooperation of 
several city and county departments. Under normal circumstances, Caltrans would 
have needed city permits and clearance from the San Diego County Air Pollution 
Control District before workers could raze the houses, Saville said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company had to turn off gas and reroute 
electrical lines away from the houses, Saville said. San Diego City Councilman 
John Hartley assisted with getting waivers for the permits and persuading 
SDG&amp;E to cut off services quickly, Saville said. 
</P>
<P>
"The paper work for an individual parcel of land can take weeks or it can take 
months," he said. "This allows us to cut through months of red tape." 
</P>
<P>
John Wainio, a spokesman for Hartley, said the councilman was pleased to see 
the project moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big win for us," Wainio said, adding that the neighborhood "has been a 
mess for two years." 
</P>
<P>
But, even if Caltrans meets its goal of tearing down the houses by the end of 
June, several abandoned houses will remain in the area. To complete the 
construction project, Caltrans needs to acquire 94 parcels of property in the 
neighborhood, Saville said. Some, but not all, of those contain buildings that 
have been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Workers have demolished about 170 houses since the project began four years 
ago, Saville said. Gormlie said he hasn't been satisfied with the rate at which 
Caltrans has been clearing the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this action -- finally," Gormlie said. "Our question is, when are 
they going to get rid of the rest of them?" 
</P>
<P>
Actual construction work on the project, which has been delayed several times 
because of lack of funding and neighborhood opposition, is not scheduled to 
begin until the fall of 1993, Saville said.

COUNCIL OKS 1ST STEP TO BUILD WATER TANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fillmore City Council has paved the way for construction of its third water 
storage facility by certifying an environmental report on the 3-million-gallon 
tank, despite public opposition to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site on Foothill Drive next to an existing water tank has been 
opposed by nearby residents, who say the city is creating an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting May 22, residents testified against the city's plan to 
screen the tank with landscaping. About a dozen people protested the removal of 
a grove of 40-year-old oaks, pines and peppertrees to clear the site for 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that replacement landscaping would fail to shield the tank from view, 
residents asked the council to preserve at least some of the trees. The council 
agreed to continue the public hearing at the next meeting, allowing staff 
members time to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's session, a consultant's report showed that replanting the same 
trees would be more costly than putting in new landscaping and that removing 
most of the trees is necessary for construction to begin. Seeking to mollify 
protesters, city officials presented a more detailed landscaping design for the 
new facility, and said they would improve plantings around the existing tank 
and take responsibility for maintaining all the landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
City officials continued to maintain that Foothill Drive is the best site for 
the new tank despite residents' requests to relocate the project. During the 
past year, Fillmore city staff members examined 10 sites before declaring 
Foothill the most suitable. According to a geological report, the site can 
safely support the tank.

BABY ELEPHANT OFF TO SHAKY START; 
</P>
<P>
SURVIVAL: WILD ANIMAL PARK OFFICIALS WORRY ABOUT SURVIVAL OF NEWBORN ASIAN 
ELEPHANT AFTER HIS MOTHER REJECTS HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A newborn Asian elephant at the San Diego Wild Animal Park had to be separated 
from his mother shortly after birth Wednesday, leading keepers to worry whether 
the valuable young pachyderm will survive. 
</P>
<P>
"The calf bellowed and scared the mom, and so Mom began to kick, stomp and try 
to kill the baby," said Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the park. "At that point, 
the keepers physically placed themselves between Mom and the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom, who witnessed the event, said it was "miraculous" that no one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while it was all a jumble of keepers and elephants, and she did strike 
out and hit the keepers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred shortly after veterinarians cleared Omar the calf's lungs 
of fluid and reunited the elephants, Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
The park has tried since 1984 to establish an Asian elephant breeding program, 
but has been unsuccessful. Three fetuses have been stillborn at the park in 
recent years, so officials are willing to take extraordinary measures to save 
Omar, the first to make it out of the womb alive. 
</P>
<P>
The park now has eight Asian elephants, Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
A healthy male Asian elephant is worth $20,000 to $30,000, said Mike Keele, 
assistant curator at the Washington Park Zoo in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four Asian elephants have been born in the Washington zoo since 1962, 
making it the most successful such program in the country, Keele said. 
</P>
<P>
Raising elephants is difficult "primarily because of the bull elephant's 
enormous size and power," he said. "There are not that many facilities in the 
country that can house a bull. . . . They are capable of tearing down a 
building." 
</P>
<P>
It is also difficult to get them to breed because they need a free-roaming, 
"herd feeling," Keele said. 
</P>
<P>
More emphasis has been placed on raising Asian elephants than African elephants 
because Asians are fewer, but both are in danger of extinction, he said. A team 
of at least five keepers and veterinarians are monitoring the infant and 
17-year-old mother, Connie, around the clock "until the situation changes 
drastically," Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
It is unsafe for the 265-pound calf to suckle from his mother, and zoo 
officials cannot milk enough from Connie themselves to ensure his survival, 
Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
Getting milk to the calf is crucial because it contains ingredients that 
develop the youngster's immune system, but park officials are taking it slowly. 
The pair are being reunited every four hours for short periods to try to get 
Connie to accept her son. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still concerned that she might repeat this aggression," Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
During the get-acquainted sessions, Connie is bound with leg chains and Omar is 
on a leash. The restraints are necessary for the safety of the elephants and 
park officials, Hanscom said.

<P>
The Ventura County Community College District board of trustees has voted to 
form a committee to search for a replacement for Chancellor Barbara Derryberry, 
who is retiring in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 4 to 1 to form the 20-member screening committee. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Tom Ely voted against the proposal, arguing that the committee was too 
large to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will include faculty, administrators, community members and one 
student from each of the county's community colleges in Moorpark, Oxnard and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Members will screen applicants, rank them and present the board with a handful 
of finalists. 
</P>
<P>
The board of trustees will conduct final interviews and make the section by 
June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said they wanted representatives on the screening committee from 
each employee group that will come in contact with the new chancellor, 
including clerical and custodial workers. 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor's duties include implementing board policy, supervising 
management personnel, overseeing contract negotiations with district employees 
and representing the district in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Derryberry, who announced her retirement last month, will remain with the 
district until June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney who has served as chancellor since 1988, Derryberry has worked for 
the district for 20 years in several roles, including as business instructor at 
Ventura College and as the district's vice chancellor for personnel and 
affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
In her remaining year as chancellor, she will act as a consultant to the 
district in looking for her replacement. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL OKS FUNDS TO MEET ORDER ON 
JAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel approved a $2.7-million plan Tuesday to help 
the Police Department meet a court order to speed the time jail inmates are 
required to wait for arraignment and allow them visits, showers and recreation 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will help the department comply with a court ruling stemming from a 
1977 class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf 
of Isaac Youngblood and other people imprisoned for more than two days without 
being charged. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan approved by the Budget and Finance Committee, 25 officers will 
be promoted to detective for filing cases in court, 41 will be assigned to jail 
details and 14 other positions will be established. Capt. Garrett Zimmon said 
the department has been complying with most aspects of the order since 1988.

Northridge Junior High School student Mary Guzman was understandably nervous 
Wednesday. The eighth-grader was scheduled to pilot her first space shuttle 
mission after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to mess up," Guzman said. 
</P>
<P>
But the 13-year-old Reseda resident took command of the joy stick and guided 
her three colleagues to a perfect landing after a 93-minute flight aboard the 
Northridge Discovery Simulator -- a computerized plywood and plexiglass copy of 
NASA's space shuttle cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
"That was fun," she said after landing. 
</P>
<P>
The full-size space shuttle cockpit -- outfitted with flashing lights, gauges, 
800 toggle switches, two computer screens and a view of Earth from space -- was 
built by students and faculty with a $7,000 grant from GTE Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle crew followed the flight's progress on two computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
The craft's purpose is not space exploration, but to interest eighth-graders in 
fractions, decimals and scientific notation, said math teacher Ronn Yablun, who 
organized the project. 
</P>
<P>
Like it's real-life counterpart, the school's space shuttle is designed to be 
reusable. Yablun said he plans 10 missions a year beginning in the fall.

FIRST STEPS TAKEN TO GROUND NOISIEST PLANES AT VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners took a first step Wednesday 
toward outlawing the noisiest private jets at Van Nuys Airport, despite fervent 
pleas from aircraft owners and operators. 
</P>
<P>
But commissioners deadlocked on a second proposed noise-reduction ordinance, 
which would have immediately barred additional noisy jets from being based at 
the general aviation facility. 
</P>
<P>
On the key long-range noise regulation, the board voted 3 to 1 to tentatively 
endorse a plan to phase out the noisiest planes over the next eight years. 
Final action on the ordinance is at least six months away, commissioners said. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people attended the board's meeting at the Airtel Plaza Hotel at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners, who made up about one-third of the crowd, generally welcomed the 
proposed noise limits but said they did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would gradually ban takeoffs and landings of the noisiest jets 
over the next eight years. As of January, it would bar takeoffs by planes rated 
by the Federal Aviation Administration as producing 85 decibels of noise on 
takeoff -- which airport officials said would affect only a handful of older 
planes, mostly private jets, based at Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Between then and January, 1998, the maximum would gradually be lowered to 77 
decibels. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials estimate that the 77-decibel level would force out about half 
of the 90 jets now based at Van Nuys. About 800 piston-engine planes also are 
based at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the airport has only one noise regulation. It bars takeoffs by 
planes generating more than 74 decibels between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., except for 
police, fire department, military and medical emergency flights. 
</P>
<P>
Under the long-range ordinance, the start of that curfew would be moved up to 
10 p.m., but not until January, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
The board also debated the future of a 94-acre site proposed for development in 
the airport's northwest corner, south of Roscoe Boulevard along the east side 
of Balboa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the land has been vacant for years, but two-thirds of it became 
available for development two months ago when the Air National Guard moved to 
Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants, P&amp;D Technologies, were asked to recommend possible uses 
for the land. The firm came up with eight alternatives that included aviation, 
recreation, industrial and commercial uses. 
</P>
<P>
Each alternative includes an aviation museum and park, ranging in size from 
three acres to 33.5 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council proposed another plan, under 
which 17.5 acres would be set aside for the museum and park. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory council's plan also envisions using 16 acres of the site to 
relocate the Flyaway terminal from Woodley Avenue and Saticoy Street on the 
airport's east side. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said that land now used for the terminal, which runs 51 buses a 
day to and from Los Angeles International Airport, could be converted to 
commercial and industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
But the consultants concluded that it would be too costly to move the Flyaway 
operation to the west side of the airport, and that the existing terminal site 
would not be as attractive to commercial and industrial developers. 
</P>
<P>
The development plan finally approved by the airport board must ultimately be 
approved by the Los Angeles City Council and the FAA.

OLD RAILROAD DEPOT STUDIED FOR MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like most Western towns, the advent of the railroad played a major role in the 
development of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
When the Santa Susana Railroad Tunnel was opened in 1904, it transformed the 
quiet Ventura County farming community into an important trade center by 
connecting it with nearby Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the only means of transportation between the Simi and San Fernando 
valleys was by wagon trail over the steep, rock-studded Santa Susana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Rancho Simi Recreation and Parks District wants to pay tribute to the 
railroad by turning a vacant Southern Pacific railroad depot into a historical 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
The district at its meeting today is expected to approve an agreement with the 
Rancho Simi Foundation, a nonprofit community organization, "to work as 
partners in the restoration of the building," said Dmitri Hunt, a parks 
official. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story railroad depot was used from 1904 to 1974, when it sat alongside 
the tracks at Tapo Street and Los Angeles Avenue. In 1975, it was purchased by 
the park district for $1 and moved to its present site on Katherine Road in 
Santa Susana Park. 
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the depot, which was recognized in 1976 as a county 
historical landmark, will cost between $100,000 and $200,000 and is expected to 
take at least two years, Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
He said converting the depot into a railroad museum has been planned for about 
six years, but the district did not have the money for the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said the agreement with the Rancho Simi Foundation calls for most of the 
renovation work to be done by volunteers and that material costs will be shared 
by both the district and the community organization. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Griffin, who heads the 50-member foundation, said his group has raised 
more than $5,000 for renovation and hopes to begin work by August. 
</P>
<P>
One of the planned exhibits will be a miniature model railroad being built by 
Griffin's group that will replicate the Burbank-to-Oxnard line. The museum will 
also feature an assortment of historical photographs and displays of various 
railroad memorabilia. CARLOS V. LOZANO

COUNCILMAN PROTESTS EJECTIONS OF BUSINESSMEN FROM L.A.-PADRES GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Ron Roberts said Wednesday the San Diego Padres should 
reevaluate their security policy in the wake of a weekend incident in which two 
local businessmen were ejected from the stadium for yelling insults at the 
visiting team. 
</P>
<P>
"Those men did absolutely nothing wrong, and I say that without qualification," 
said Roberts, who observed the incident during Sunday's 2-1 Padres victory over 
the Los Angeles Dodgers at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Adams, the Padres' vice president of business operations, said Wednesday 
that businessman Phil Palisoul and real estate developer Michael Alessio were 
removed from the stands at the request of Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda and 
Dodgers outfielder Hubie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said that Brooks told Lasorda and a security guard on duty in the Dodgers 
dugout that among the derisive taunts yelled at him during the 8th inning of 
Sunday's loss was a racial slur -- an accusation that Palisoul and Alessio's 
attorney heatedly deny. 
</P>
<P>
Lionel P. Hernholm Jr., Alessio's lawyer, said late Wednesday that his client, 
a prominent GOP contributor and a delegate to the 1988 Republican Convention, 
is contemplating legal action against the Padres, who hire the Chula Vista firm 
of Pro-Tect Professional Services to manage security at games. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the Padres' policy is to automatically remove any fan that members 
of the opposing team want removed, regardless of the reason. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to understand that we have an obligation to protect the 
visiting team," Adams said. "When such a situation develops, we can't get into 
a trial-by-jury situation. We have to resolve the problem and resolve it 
immediately. We can't sit around and debate it." 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts, a member of the Padres' fan advisory committee, said the policy is 
inflexible and irrational and needs to be revised immediately. He said he met 
with Padres management on Wednesday and suggested that fans involved in such 
fracases in the future be relocated to another part of the stadium -- Alessio 
and Palisoul were sitting directly behind the Dodgers' dugout -- or at least be 
able to air their side of the story before being asked to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said he will consider Roberts' request. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who was sitting near Alessio and Palisoul, said that "nothing even 
remotely resembling a racial slur" was hurled at Brooks, who, interviewed 
before the start of Wednesday night's Dodgers game in Houston, stopped short of 
saying he had been the object of a racist remark. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy (Palisoul) was saying a whole bunch of stuff," Brooks said. "He was 
hassling everybody the whole game. I may have heard a racial slur in there, but 
it was a lot of other things. He was getting on everybody. I just wanted him to 
stop bothering me." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said he complained about Palisoul to Dodgers Manager Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
"Hubie said this guy was getting on him, so I just told the guard to tell this 
guy to stop bothering my player," Lasorda said Wednesday night. "All I did was 
ask the guard to tell him to lay off my guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to take up for my players. As long as they don't antagonize or bother 
the fans, I've got to stick up for 'em, and I always will." 
</P>
<P>
But both Brooks and Lasorda deny that they ever asked the security guards to 
remove Palisoul or Alessio. 
</P>
<P>
Palisoul said Wednesday he "felt humiliated" over the incident, mainly because 
he, Alessio and attorney Hernholm had taken to the game their sons, ages 11 and 
12. He said the boys play together on a Little League team, and they and their 
fathers were surprised by the crude language and gestures exhibited by the 
Dodgers throughout Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"All during the game, we engaged in what I would call harmless chiding or 
heckling of the players," Palisoul said. "But it was not obscene or anything. 
You know, it was just stuff you would do to the opposing team. There was 
nothing that you could even remotely construe as a racial slur. That was the 
furthest thing from anything that was said. 
</P>
<P>
"The final thing that caused the blow-up -- that caused Lasorda to blow up -- 
was that, after Brooks popped up (in the 8th inning), I said, 'Nice hit, 
Hubie,' and then he said something to me. Well, then, Lasorda jumped out and 
started screaming at me, and it was very profane stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Geez, you're a little tense, aren't you?,' and then he got the guard 
and came out and pointed at me and Mike Alessio. But racial slur? That was 
patently untrue." 
</P>
<P>
Palisoul said he and Alessio were taken to "a cage" beneath the stadium. He 
said they were told to enter the cage marked "ejection." He said the other cage 
was labeled "detox." 
</P>
<P>
"They kept us in there about five minutes and then escorted us out of the 
stadium," Palisoul said. "He said if we came back in we would be in violation 
of municipal law. So, we waited outside for Chip (Hernholm) and our boys." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Hernholm said that, after Palisoul's "Nice hit, Hubie" remark, Brooks 
"came back out, threw a bat and helmet and started cursing and calling us names 
in front of our children. 
</P>
<P>
"We all said, 'Nice talk, nice language, watch your mouth' and 'What a great 
way to talk in front of Little Leaguers,' but never ever was there anything 
like a racial slur."

ZOO WANTS CARRIER HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four San Diego Zoo animals died of dehydration in April as they were being 
trucked across the country, and zoo officials said they have demanded that the 
animal transporter be disciplined for its "deplorable" behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jouett, a San Diego Zoo spokesman, said a male fishing cat, a female sloth 
bear and two palm civets that left San Diego on April 21 died while en route to 
the Capron Park Zoo in Attleboro, Mass. Anothr nine animals in the same 
shipment, including endangered species such as the Nubian ibex and a Sumatran 
tiger, arrived in poor shape at New York's Bronx Zoo and at Zoo Atlanta in 
Georgia, Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're beyond outraged," Jouett said. "Animals that we entrusted to what we 
presumed to be a qualified transporter died in unprecedented numbers. It's just 
a deplorable situation. Just to think of the animals -- what they went through 
-- is tragic." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said that, despite San Diego's recommendation that the animals be 
shipped by air, the three receiving zoos who were paying for the transport 
decided to hire the Zoological Animal Exchange in Natural Bridge, Va., to drive 
the animals by truck. 
</P>
<P>
The Zoological Animal Exchange is registered by the American Assn. of 
Zoological Parks and Aquariums, a mark of distinction among haulers, but the 
San Diego Zoo had never used it before. Anyone with a U.S. Department of 
Agriculture license may transport animals, but the San Diego Zoo tries to use 
AAZPA registered haulers "whenever possible," Jouett said. He said the Zoo had 
demanded that the AAZPA investigate how the animals were treated. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're interested in now is a full investigation, some disciplinary action 
and a full hearing of exactly what happened from the time they left San Diego 
in good health with veterinary inspection and when they arrived, dead." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said he could not discuss many details of the investigation, but he said 
that San Diego Zoo officials suspect that the driver employed by the transport 
company may not have been qualified.

TEACHER PLEADS GUILTY TO MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teacher at Knox Elementary School pleaded guilty Wednesday to three counts of 
molesting two 12-year-old female students. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Booker Brown, 48, who has been in custody since his arrest Nov. 30, 
1989, entered into a plea bargain agreement Tuesday in which 26 other sex 
charges involving the same girls were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Brown faces a maximum sentence of eight years in state prison and a $10,000 
fine. Upon his release on parole, he must register as a sex offender. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz said the pleas were taken to avoid traumatizing 
the girls, who would have had to testify in open court at the trial, scheduled 
for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
They testified at Brown's preliminary hearing in February, but that hearing was 
closed to the press and public. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Brown pleaded guilty to performing lewd acts on the girls that occurred in 1987 
and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his felony conviction for molestation, Brown will probably lose his 
teaching credential.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TWO GIRLS CHARGED IN SHOOTING OF OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two girls from Highland Park, ages 13 and 14, denied assault and robbery 
charges Wednesday in the holdup and shooting last Saturday of an off-duty Los 
Angeles police officer. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, Stacy Lim, 27, was critically wounded in a gun battle outside her 
Santa Clarita home. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old youth, Joel Garcia Valenzuela of Highland Park, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jaime Corral, sitting in the Northeast 
Juvenile Justice Center, ordered the girls held in a county juvenile detention 
center and set a trial date for July 9. They were charged with conspiracy to 
commit robbery, attempted robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and attempted 
grand theft of an auto with a firearm involved. 
</P>
<P>
The girls accompanied Valenzuela and a fourth suspect, Arvin Mani, 20, also of 
Highland Park, as they tried to steal Lim's customized Ford Bronco, authorities 
said. The youths saw Lim near the Pasadena and Golden State freeways, liked the 
custom rims on her truck and followed her home, where they confronted her about 
1:40 a.m. Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Mani pleaded not guilty to an identical set of charges in Newhall Municipal 
Court Tuesday. He is being held in lieu of $1-million bail in the Los Angeles 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Lim remained in guarded but improving condition Wednesday at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Valencia, according to Police Lt. Dave Waterman of the 
Northeast Division, where Lim is assigned.

</P>

<P>
A 29-year-old man who was shot outside a Van Nuys apartment Friday night died 
of his injuries Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Amparo Lopez of Panorama City was found lying in the parking lot of an 
apartment building in the 14500 block of Blythe Street just after midnight. He 
had been shot several times in the torso. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects or motive for the crime, but detectives said a crowd 
may have seen the shooting. "We have reason to believe that there may be as 
many as 20 witnesses. We're looking at that right now," Los Angeles police 
Detective Jim Vojtecky said.

A BOOST FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Affordable housing got a boost recently when a federal judge agreed to allow 
local nonprofit groups to develop projects with $17.5 million from the Century 
Freeway replacement housing fund. The community groups will also get technical 
assistance and private investment from the Local Initiatives Support Corp. That 
combination should allow 500 townhouses, condominiums and apartments to get 
built quickly, and for fewer public dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The Century Freeway was envisioned as more than 17.3 miles of traffic lanes 
between Norwalk and the eastern edge of LAX. The project also included an 
unusual commitment to jobs, training, affirmative action and replacement 
housing for the residents of 7,000 homes that were razed to make way for the 
freeway. It was intended, according to the judge overseeing the controversy, as 
a highway "that had a heart." The state paid off tenants and homeowners, but 
also promised to replace half of the housing that was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite good intentions, the housing program, run by a small state agency, got 
bogged down by inexperience and layers of bureaucracy. At various steps along 
the way, the projects required approvals from the Federal Highway 
Administration and Caltrans, two government agencies that know a lot about 
highways and little about housing. 
</P>
<P>
The housing program slowly produced, as a series in The Times pointed out 
nearly three years ago, poorly built, badly located or half-empty apartments 
and condominiums. The tenants' lawyer, John Phillips of the Center for Law in 
the Public Interest, argued justifiably that a public-private partnership could 
do better. 
</P>
<P>
The new arrangement was approved last week by U.S. Circuit Judge Harry 
Pregerson, who has overseen this case for 18 years. It allocates a fraction of 
the remaining $126 million in federal funds to nonprofit developers. LISC will 
add private dollars raised from tax incentives to triple the number of units. 
</P>
<P>
Developing low-income housing is not an easy task. Giving any part of that job 
to nonprofit developers should pay off quickly -- with more affordable housing.

OXNARD STARTS HEARINGS OVER TROUBLED BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council has begun hearings on how to deal with the city budget 
crisis, but officials said they won't make final decisions until they see the 
results of a management audit next week. 
</P>
<P>
The council is discussing how to avoid a projected $2.8-million budget deficit 
next year. The hearings started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is anyone looking forward to the next few days," City 
Manager David Mora said at the outset on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city must consider service reductions and as many as 64 personnel 
cuts, including 16 from the Police Department and 8 from the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The city had hoped to raise $5 million annually with a 5% utility tax increase, 
but voters rejected it on June 5 by a 3-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
The management audit was originally due May 30 but was delayed until next week. 
It is expected to explain the cause of Oxnard's fiscal crisis and recommend 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi has criticized the auditing firm, Cresap Management 
Consultants of Washington, for suggesting in private conversations that the 
city cut 41 positions in the Police Department, eliminate 18 positions in the 
Fire Department, close two fire stations and sell some city parks. 
</P>
<P>
Mora said some personnel cuts are inevitable but revealed several ways in which 
the city can lessen the impact. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city can spend part of a $1.4-million rebate from the state-run 
public employee retirement program. The rebate was the result of successful 
investments made with the city's retirement funds, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mora said the city can avoid immediate layoffs by spending some of the rebate 
money to pay employees until they find other jobs or retire. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Manuel Lopez recommended that the city spend $600,000 of the rebate 
to allow staff reductions through attrition and use the balance to reduce the 
deficit. Councilwoman Dorothy Maron agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Geraldine (Gerry) Furr suggested that half the rebate go toward 
phasing out employees and the other half go to replenish the city's reserve 
funds, which have dropped from $9 million to about $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years the City Council has dipped into the reserves to avoid 
deficits. This year it vowed to leave the reserves untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Mora said the council could also reduce the deficit marginally and avoid 
further cuts by putting off a five-year, $3-million project to remove asbestos 
from several city buildings. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city has earmarked $457,000 this year to begin the asbestos-removal 
project. But Mora said the city should not put off the project. "The asbestos 
problem is not going to go away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's hearing, Takasugi suggested that the city delay the project but 
put aside $120,000 toward the cost of removing the asbestos in the future.

ROUTE 56 FOES SET UP LEGAL ROADBLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angry North City West residents and the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy joined 
forces Wednesday to sue the San Diego City Council in an attempt to halt 
construction of the western end of proposed Route 56 through their community. 
</P>
<P>
The suit challenges the council's actions in certifying the environmental 
impact report for a 1.8-mile section of the proposed east-west freeway, which 
eventually will link inland Interstate 15 with Interstate 5 on the coast. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, the city violated the California Environmental Quality 
Act by failing to study adequately other options for the freeway route. The 
present route travels through the Carmel Valley, through the middle of the 
fast-growing planned community of North City West near Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Mailhot, chairman of the Carmel Valley Coalition, said the group has 
joined with the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy in its suit to halt construction of 
the freeway through Carmel Valley, site of the Penasquitos Lagoon. The Del Mar 
Terrace Conservancy is a 5-year-old nonprofit group that fights for the 
preservation of Penasquitos Lagoon; the Carmel Valley Coalition is a larger 
organization made up of several environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the city of San Diego also failed to follow state law by 
ignoring the impacts of other, related construction projects, including a 
$45-million interchange linking the proposed freeway to I-5, a 
multimillion-dollar I-5 widening project and the impacts of construction of the 
remaining 7 miles of Route 56 freeway and its link to Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
John Reaves, attorney for the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy, said the group seeks 
a writ from the court that would force the City Council to rescind its approval 
of the western portion of Route 56 until it has studied other routes and has 
met Environmental Quality Act's requirements in its environmental impact 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
Reaves estimated that the matter could be heard by a Superior Court judge by 
October. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. John Witt said that he could not comment on the suit against the 
city because he had not yet seen a copy of the filing, but did say, "I am 
confident that what legal advice we have given the city in this matter has been 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Mailhot said that the Carmel Valley Coalition also is planning to begin a 
referendum petition drive to have the freeway routing through Carmel Valley 
rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
Mailhot explained that the roadway would cut through the center of North City 
West residential areas, causing noise and air pollution for abutting 
neighborhoods and spreading traffic congestion through the entire community 
because only partial ramps will be built to link Interstate 5 and the new 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum drive cannot start until the San Diego City Council votes final 
adoption of the ordinance on the Route 56 alignment, an action expected June 
18, Mailhot said. 
</P>
<P>
The group plans to collect at least 45,000 signatures of registered San Diego 
city voters, although only about 28,500 are needed to qualify the referendum. 
If an adequate number of qualified signatures are gathered, the City Council 
will be forced to rescind the ordinance or to place it on the November ballot 
to be decided by a citywide vote.

Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter (R-Bonita) strains credibility with her defense of 
the 13,000 letters she sent at public expense to constituents in the final days 
of her primary campaign. The letters went out in batches of 199 -- the maximum 
number of "substantially similar" letters allowed monthly under Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven groups of Hunter's constituents in the 76th District received 
missives on topics such as child care and legislation on voting aids for the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
When her opponent complained about the May 31 letters, Hunter called the timing 
a fluke, saying that she had finally won approval from the Assembly Rules 
Committee to use a special computer program. 
</P>
<P>
As the "Saturday Night Live" Church Lady might have responded: "How 
conveeenient!" 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, an abortion-rights advocate who won a nationally publicized special 
election in 1989 after the Supreme Court's Webster decision, added: "I don't 
need name ID. That's the last thing in the world I need. I probably have more 
name ID than any person in this Assembly, except for maybe Willie Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's formidable name ID helped her squeak out a 51.6% to 48.4% primary 
victory in the staunchly conservative district, which covers parts of San Diego 
and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the law repealed in 1988 by the passage of Proposition 73 would 
have prevented Hunter from sending any mail to constituents before Election 
Day. Under the old code, there was no limit on the number of letters 
legislators could send to constituents -- but no mailings were allowed after an 
incumbent filed as a candidate in a general election.

4 NAMED ALL-CITY IN BASEBALL 
</P>

<P>
Four South Bay prep standouts have been named to All-L.A. City Section baseball 
teams by the First Interstate Bank-Amateur Athletic Foundation board of 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mike Busby and third baseman Julian Pardo of Banning High and Carson 
shortstop Alfredo Rodriguez were selected to the 4-A Division squad. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne shortstop Paco Cervantes was named to the 3-A team. 
</P>
<P>
Busby, a 6-foot-4, 200-pound junior, was 9-4 with a 1.45 earned-run average. 
The right-hander led the South Bay with 127 strikeouts in 92 innings and was 
named Pacific League most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Pardo was the leading hitter for Pacific League champion Banning. The senior 
batted .466 (41 for 88) with 10 doubles, three triples, one home run and 24 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez topped Pacific League runner-up Carson in several categories, 
including batting average (.467), runs scored (28), doubles (six) and RBIs 
(19). He was also a relief pitcher and two weeks ago was named MVP of the West 
team in a City Section all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes, a junior, paced Southern League runner-up Narbonne with a .385 
batting average and a 2-2 pitching record. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher-infielders Reed McMackin (12-2, .402) of 4-A champion Chatsworth and 
Patrick Treend (12-1, .375) of runner-up El Camino Real of Woodland Hills were 
named division co-MVPs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A Division, pitcher Dan Choi (12-1-1) of champion Fairfax and utility 
man Rene Lopez (.444, 5-1) of Bell were chosen co-MVPs. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick catcher Todd Seneker has been named to the All-Southern Section Small 
School Division team. 
</P>
<P>
A three-time All-Prep League selection, Seneker hit .510 (.550 in league play) 
with six doubles, two triples, one home run and 24 RBIs in 17 games. The 6-1, 
180-pound junior threw out 70% of the runners who attempted to steal. ROB

TALENTED ALL-VALLEY BASEBALL TEAM PROVES TOUGH CLUB TO CRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the best way to evaluate the quality of The Times' 1990 All-Valley high 
school baseball team is to consider the players who are missing from the 
16-member group. What does a guy have to do to crack this list? 
</P>
<P>
This year's team has set high standards. So high, in fact, that a couple of 
players selected in the top rounds of last week's amateur baseball draft failed 
to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
The first team is led by Chatsworth and Hart highs, which each contributed 
three players. Hart's Andrew Lorraine was pitcher of the year and is joined by 
teammates Rob Davis and Lance Migita, the Indians' double-play combination. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth earned the City Section 4-A Division title behind pitcher Reed 
McMackin, infielder Nestor Martinez and outfielder Mitch Root. El Camino Real, 
which fell to Chatsworth in the final, 3-2, is represented by pitcher-first 
baseman Ryan McGuire and Pat Treend, the player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive season, a first-year coach earned the area's top 
prize. Chatsworth's Tom Meusborn follows Kennedy's Manny Alvarado as coach of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, any coach could have won with the collection of players on the second 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland outfielder Pat Bryant, who one scout called a Rickey Henderson clone, 
was selected in the second round by the Cleveland Indians. Bryant, one of the 
area's top athletes, faces the enviable task of choosing between an offer from 
the Indians and a football scholarship from the University of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham's Danny Larson, an outfielder for the Mid-Valley League champion, 
was selected in the third round by the Philadelphia Phillies. Larson will 
choose between a professional contract and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Those two lead a list of players wondering what it takes to make the All-Valley 
first team. The 16-member second team, which boasts two high draft picks, a 
Division I recruit and a host of league most valuable players, reflects the 
depth of talent in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Eddie Castellanos, another second-team selection, led Poly 
to an 18-0 East Valley League record with a 12-0 mark and a 1.70 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood infielder Erik Martinez, who batted .507, and Notre Dame 
infielder Vinnie Orlando, who batted .364 and tied a Southern Section record 
with a six-hit game, also rated no better than second-team consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda outfielder Joe Tushnet wound up on the second team despite a .562 
average and 37 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
And all second-team catcher Brent Polacheck did was bat .429, drive in an 
area-high 41 runs and help Montclair Prep win the Southern Section 1-A Division 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Second-team selection Bob Kazmirski of Agoura, who batted .443 with 21 RBIs, 
will play next season on scholarship at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of this year's second team underscores the point that athletes from 
the region seem to shine brightest on the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time in the past five seasons, the region sported a team ranked 
No. 1 in the nation by USA Today when Westlake reached the top spot. And 
Westlake catcher Mike Lieberthal follows Roger Salkeld of Saugus as the second 
consecutive player from the region to be selected third nationally in the 
amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
(Lieberthal and his Westlake teammates are included in The Times' All-Ventura 
County team.) 
</P>
<P>
Valley teams extended their domination of the City 4-A Division to 18 years 
when Chatsworth prevailed at Dodger Stadium last month.

POWERFUL BATTERY SPARKED WESTLAKE'S ASSAULT ON RECORD BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hitters ruled the diamonds of Ventura County this season, but pitching and 
defense distinguished one team as a gem. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake High tied a county record by posting 28 victories and the Warriors set 
35 school records along the way. The team's strength was its pitching staff -- 
led by pitcher of the year Mike Eby -- and its defense up the middle, anchored 
by catcher Mike Lieberthal, the player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fabulous year, just a dream year for all of us," said Rich Herrera, 
the coach of the year. "We had great camaraderie and a great spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (28-2) was ranked second in the nation by USA Today and No. 1 in the 
state by Cal-Hi Sports most of the season. The Warriors were elevated to No. 1 
by USA Today the day their season ended in a loss to Marina in the semifinals 
of the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss hurt, but in the long run, I think we'll remember the good times most 
of all," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Good times for Rio Mesa (18-6-2), the Channel League champion, came primarily 
when the team was at bat. Nine Spartan players batted better than .300 and all 
four all-county selections topped the .450 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Dmitri Young, a Rio Mesa junior and a three-time all-county choice, gave 
Lieberthal a strong challenge for player-of-the-year honors. Young led county 
players with a .589 average and he is closing in on several Southern Section 
batting records. 
</P>
<P>
"Dmitri is the most complete player I've ever seen in high school," Rio Mesa 
Coach Rich Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing all-county pitcher David Soliz, the Spartans should dominate 
next season: Young and fellow all-county choices Mike Mitchell (first base) and 
Jon McMullen (third base) all return. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (11-9) was another team with a lineup full of strong hitters. 
Five regulars batted .397 or better -- Brent Christenson, Billy Hall, Ryan 
Kritscher, Lance Martin and David Skeels. 
</P>
<P>
Although shoddy defense forced Thousand Oaks to back into the playoffs as the 
third-place Marmonte League qualifier, the Lancers scored 32 runs in three 
playoff games. The team's finest moment came in a second-round game against 
Rolling Hills in which the Lancers came back from a 10-1 deficit with nine runs 
in the seventh inning and two more in the eighth to win, 12-11. 
</P>
<P>
"Our performance in the playoffs proved we belonged there," Coach Jim Hansen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Rich Naranjo batted better than .400 for Royal (16-11), which 
finished second in the Marmonte under first-year Coach Dan Maye. Strong defense 
and the emergence of transfer pitcher Ed Smith helped win several close games 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"We came together as a team and everybody contributed," Maye said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena (20-6-2) continued its winning program under Coach Stan Hedegard. Sam 
Arroyo gave the Bulldogs an unbeatable pitcher and outfielder Ryan Denger, 
first baseman Jason Isaacs and catcher Ryan Webster provided consistent 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (15-10), a non-Ventura County team, dominated the Frontier League, and 
St. Bonaventure horned in on Fillmore's traditional dominance of the Tri-Valley 
League. The Seraphs and the Flashes each posted 13-2 league records. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bonaventure was led by Kevin Zoll, the league's player of the year and a 
second-team all-county choice. Zoll batted .549 and posted an 8-4 pitching 
record with a 1.21 earned-run average.

PRESSURES TO RECRUIT, WIN FORCED PAEZ TO RE-EVALUATE COACHING JOB AT CLEVELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marc Paez bought a new car in August. Five days a week, he commuted from his 
apartment in the South Bay to his job as basketball coach at the Reseda campus 
of Cleveland High. 
</P>
<P>
"I put 17,000 on it already," Paez said with a grin. "Tell everybody that's the 
real reason I'm not coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Paez says a variety of factors drove him away after one season. 
Citing intolerable off-the-court distractions, Paez last week tendered his 
resignation as both coach and teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Paez, 30, said he took a "personal inventory" and decided that his days of 
coaching high school basketball should stop. 
</P>
<P>
"I found this year that there were some distractions, off-the-court 
distractions, that made the job very challenging," said Paez, who led the 
Cavaliers to a 21-6 record and the City Section 4-A Division semifinals. "It 
had nothing whatsoever to do with the players or what took place on the court." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland stumbled early and Paez immediately felt hot breath on his back 
coming from the stands. He knew that comparisons to former Coach Bob Braswell 
-- who took Cleveland to the 4-A final twice in his four-year tenure before 
becoming an assistant at Cal State Long Beach -- were inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
They were also unfair, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out 1-3 and I think some of these people at that time may have 
formed clear-cut opinions as to my abilities as a coach," Paez said. "We 
finished so strongly -- we won 20 out of 22 and lose by a point in the semis -- 
and I would have hoped that some of that criticism would have gone away. That 
wasn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
Paez was also less demonstrative than Braswell, which he said was 
misinterpreted. But as hesitant as Paez was to jump and shout, he said he was 
downright reluctant to participate in one of the less forthright aspects of 
coaching at a high-profile school: recruiting and player brokering. 
</P>
<P>
"If high school basketball at the top level has reached the point where a coach 
has to actively recruit players, strike up deals with shoe companies and 
schedule trips to compete with other schools, then I don't feel comfortable 
playing that role," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving to Cleveland, Paez was an assistant coach at St. Bernard High in 
Playa del Rey for seven seasons and was dean of students. Admitting that his 
views might seem somewhat "philosophical," Paez nonetheless believes that 
coaches should be teachers first and coaches second. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about the amount of recruiting going on and about the amount of 
transfers from one school to another," he said. "There's blatant recruiting 
going on, but there is a complete lack of policing on the part of the (L.A. 
Unified School) district or the CIF." 
</P>
<P>
Outside influences are more pervasive every year, Paez said, creating 
unregulated spring- and summer-league seasons that de-emphasize the high school 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys running these leagues are not high school coaches, they are not 
teachers and they are not educators," Paez said. "A lot of these guys are 
amateurs. It scares me to see the amount of influence they exert over kids and 
coaches and with college recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"I really find that distressing and disappointing . . . I don't know that I 
want to be a part of that situation." 
</P>
<P>
There were internal forces at work too. Pat McCook, apparently upset over a 
lack of playing time, tried to transfer to Taft at midseason, creating a 
temporary rift. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a bitter young man," Paez said, laughing. "I think a few people have 
gotten the impression that the heat was on and that I couldn't handle it. If 
that was the case, I would have done it in midseason, when the heat was really 
on. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the season, the job I did, and I'm proud of the players," he 
said.

BELLATTY BACK AT CALABASAS HELM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Refreshed after a two-year absence from boys' basketball, Bill Bellatty has 
returned as the coach at Calabasas High. 
</P>
<P>
After leading the Coyotes to the Southern Section playoffs four times in five 
seasons, Bellatty resigned after the 1987-88 season, citing burnout. 
</P>
<P>
Bellatty coached the girls' team last season, but he has attended only two 
boys' games since resigning. However, his interest was renewed when Dave 
Hoffman, who replaced Bellatty, left Calabasas to coach at Chaminade in May. 
</P>
<P>
"When Dave decided to leave, I started thinking about it," Bellatty said. "My 
enthusiasm is back." 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas was 10-13 last season. Greg Waugh, a 6-foot-7 center, and Tom Hoover, 
a 6-2 swingman, are the top returning players. STEVE HENSON

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WILBUR'S 4 HITS SPARK WOODLAND HILLS EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woodland Hills East third baseman Carey Wilbur was enjoying a four-for-four 
performance Wednesday when something terrible happened. His team kept scoring 
runs and he had to make another trip to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur made an out in his final at-bat, ruining a perfect day, but his team 
knocked off Granada Hills, 10-5, in an American Legion District 20 game at 
Granada Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
East trailed, 3-2, in the fifth when Glen Nahmias tripled home three runs to 
key a six-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Eric Rothman (3-0) scattered nine hits, walked two and struck out 
four. Shortstop Benji Belfield was two for four with a double for East (6-1). 
</P>
<P>
Gabe Miller hit a solo homer in the seventh for Granada Hills (2-5). 
</P>
<P>
In other District 20 games: 
</P>
<P>
Las Virgenes 4, Chatsworth 3 (eight innings) -- Bret Resnick hit for the cycle 
and tripled in the winning run with two out in the eighth to lead Las Virgenes 
at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Resnick finished with three runs batted in and teammates Paul Schaffer and Tom 
Hoover each had two hits for Las Virgenes (4-4). 
</P>
<P>
Harold Turk, Dusty Wood and Paul Johnson combined on a six-hitter. Johnson, who 
pitched three scoreless innings of relief, earned the win. Rodney Bloom and Wes 
Doll each had two hits for Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Encino-Tarzana 14, North Hollywood 5 -- Catcher Seth Rosenzweig hit a 
two-run home run in the third inning, then hit a bases-loaded triple in an 
11-run fourth inning to finish with five RBIs and pace Valley ET (3-2) at 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Belasco, Noah Kirshbaum, Mike Malkin and winning pitcher Jason Mansfield 
(1-1) each had two hits for Valley ET. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills West 4, Encino-Crespi 1 -- Paul Geller and Pat Treend combined 
on a five-hitter to break a three-game losing streak for West (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
Geller (1-0) pitched four innings, allowed five hits, struck out four and 
walked none. In three innings of relief, Treend struck out eight and walked 
none. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Teich and Geller each had two hits for West, which has recorded both of 
its victories at the expense of Encino-Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank 7, Van Nuys-Notre Dame 3 -- Burbank took a 3-0 lead in the first off 
spot starter Vinnie Orlando, who walked five batters in the inning at Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Medina was three for three with two RBIs and Bobby Sherwood was two for 
two with two RBIs for Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Jason McConaghy was two for two for Van Nuys-Notre Dame (5-1), which had four 
players on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 19, Agoura 6 -- Ari Jacobs and Joe Arnold each went three for five to 
pace Reseda (3-4) at Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs drove in three runs to support winner Robert Reynoso (1-0). Geoff Taylor 
went two for two for Reseda.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: HANCOCK CHOSEN ATHLETE OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ryan Hancock of Cupertino's Monta Vista High was chosen ahead of three San 
Diego nominees as Cal-High Sports boys' Athlete of the Year, it was announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mark Tennis of Cal-High Sports of Long Beach, Brigham Young 
University-bound Hancock, the state football player of the year and a pitcher 
on the state baseball team of the year, edged Christian's Tony Clark, 
University City's Jerome Price and Fallbrook's Brent Noon. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was the medium-sized school Athlete of the Year and an outfield selection 
on the medium school all-state baseball team. Julian's Travis Denmark was named 
to the all-state small school team. 
</P>
<P>
Three area players were selected to the large school all-state team: Poway 
senior pitcher Danny Miller, Grossmont junior catcher Todd Cady and Grossmont 
senior outfielder John Tatum. Grossmont (29-2), the San Diego Section 2-A 
champion, was the runner-up team of the year and the only statewide school to 
place two players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego also placed four juniors on the underclassman all-state team: Cady, 
USDHS outfielder David Sanchez, and Castle Park's Benji Gil and Mira Mesa's 
Mark Nielsen, both multi-purpose players. 
</P>
<P>
SAILING 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's second entry for the 1992 America's Cup has been accepted, 
bringing to 21 the number of potential Cup challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad Yacht Club had received a two-week extension on the May 26 entry 
deadline because the club was having trouble transferring money for the $25,000 
entry fee to the United States, said the San Diego Yacht Club and Challenger of 
Record Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Cup officials said the Leningrad challenge is headed by Vsevold Kukushkyn of 
the Red Star Syndicate. Two International America's Cup Class yachts are 
planned, with the first to be launched this year, said Kukushkyn, a sports 
writer with Tass, the Soviet government's news agency. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Leningrad challenge, the Soviet Union is represented for the 
first time in the America's Cup by the Odessa Arcadia Racing Yacht Club.

San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire has been named a preseason first-team 
All-American by the Professional Athletic Personnel NFL Draft Report. The team 
consists of seniors who are eligible for the 1991 NFL draft, and selections 
were based on professional potential. McGwire was rated seventh overall for the 
draft by the organization, its highest rating ever for a Western Athletic 
Conference player. McGwire, 6-feet-8, passed for 3,651 yards and 16 touchdowns 
last season.

LOWERY FUND CONTROVERSY RAISED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a development that renews a controversy from his last campaign, Rep. Bill 
Lowery (R-San Diego) was among the public officials named by the U.S. Justice 
Department Wednesday as unknowing recipients of thousands of dollars in illegal 
corporate donations from a failed Texas savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
Along with such notables as former House Speaker Jim Wright, Sen. Alan Cranston 
and then-Reps. Tony Coehlo and Jack Kemp, Lowery improperly benefitted from the 
largess of Vernon Savings &amp; Loan, according to a 38-count indictment filed 
Wednesday against Don R. Dixon, the thrift's former owner. Vernon collapsed in 
1987 and was later seized by the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. at 
a cost of about $1.3 billion -- one of the most notorious thrift failures in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery's connection with Dixon first generated controversy in his 1988 
reelection campaign, when it was revealed that he had received jet trips, yacht 
parties and a Del Mar fund-raiser valued at about $18,000 from the Vernon 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, however, Lowery has insisted that he believed that Dixon was 
spending his personal money, not corporate funds, on those occasions -- a 
position bolstered by Wednesday's Justice Department filings. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that the campaigns and individuals named in the 
indictment as recipients of donations from the funds of a savings and loan 
engaged in any illegal or improper activity," the Justice Department said. "As 
a matter of fact, there is no evidence that the named recipients of the 
campaign contributions had any knowledge of the illegal or improper activity 
alleged in the indictment." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Higgins, Lowery's administrative assistant, said Wednesday that the 
Justice Department's statement demonstrates that Lowery's "campaign committee 
was defrauded, just as the taxpayers have been defrauded by the alleged 
wrongdoings of Don Dixon." 
</P>
<P>
Even before Wednesday's indictment, bankruptcy records showed that Vernon's 
corporate funds, not Dixon's personal money, paid for the jet trips, yacht 
parties and Del Mar fund-raiser that Lowery received -- only several of the 
many illegal contributions that Wednesday's indictment charges were made to 
state and federal officials "for the purpose of currying favor and influence 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery could not be reached for comment Wednesday. However, in an October, 
1988, interview, Lowery said that, on each occasion, Dixon "represented these 
things as being personal expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
The expenditures by Vernon Savings that were made in Lowery's behalf include: 
</P>
<P>
Three January, 1986 trips aboard Vernon's corporate jet: a Jan. 16-17 
round-trip from Carlsbad to Dallas for a fund-raiser, and a Jan. 20 trip from 
Palm Springs to Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lowery's campaign finance statements, his political committee 
reimbursed Vernon Savings $274 for air fare in March, 1986. However, based on 
figures included in affidavits and other records, Kripke has estimated that 
Lowery's pro-rated share of the expenses for those trips totaled about $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
A Dec. 7, 1985, fund-raiser at Dixon's $2.8-million Del Mar beach house, for 
which Vernon Savings incurred expenses of $7,238. 
</P>
<P>
In partial accounting of those expenses, Lowery reported receiving two 
non-monetary contributions of $1,000 each from Dixon and his wife, Dana, in 
January, 1986. Two months later, Lowery's campaign committee paid Dixon $2,972 
as a reimbursement for catering expenses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, in 1988, Lowery sent the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance 
Corp. a $4,000 check to cover Vernon's costs associated with the fund-raiser. 
In an accompanying letter, Lowery's campaign treasurer asked that the check be 
returned if the agency determined that Dixon, not Vernon, paid for the event. 
</P>
<P>
Three 1986 parties aboard the Vernon yacht High Spirits, at a cost to the 
thrift of $9,549, according to bankruptcy records. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents show that Lowery hosted 39 guests at one party and 24 at 
another, while the third event was a dockside party for Lowery and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that one of the parties was for the press, Lowery said: "If we thought 
we had a problem or that there was anything wrong, do you think we'd have 
invited a couple dozen reporters?"

DURENBERGER APOLOGIZES, ENDS ETHICS HEARING 
</P>

Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) apologized to his colleagues Wednesday for 
alleged financial misconduct and abruptly brought to a close an unusual public 
hearing of the Senate Ethics Committee by waiving his right to call or 
cross-examine witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger said he regretted what he characterized as honest mistakes in his 
financial affairs and asked committee members for sympathetic treatment as they 
consider possible sanctions for alleged violations of Senate ethics rules. 
</P>
<P>
"My life and reputation are at stake," said the embattled lawmaker, speaking 
carefully in a soft voice from a statement that took an hour to read. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that you will consider the whole person of Dave Durenberger, what I did 
wrong and what I've done right for this institution," he said. "I hope you will 
compare that with your own experience of life in this body." 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger insisted that "in my heart" there was no intent to break Senate 
ethics rules by allegedly evading limits on speech honorariums and claiming 
rent reimbursements for a condominium he partly owned. 
</P>
<P>
Although saying that he accepted "full responsibility" for any violations, he 
urged the committee not to follow the recommendation of special counsel Robert 
S. Bennett to publicly denounce him -- the most severe sanction available short 
of outright expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
The rare public hearing before the Ethics Committee, the first such session in 
nine years, had been expected to last as long as two weeks. But Durenberger's 
decision to waive his right to call witnesses ended the hearing after only two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger's attorney, James Hamilton, said his client had opted to put the 
complex inquiry before the committee for judgment based on the voluminous 
written record compiled over more than a year of investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), a former judge, noted that, by 
waiving further public proceedings, Durenberger would avoid the ordeal of 
cross-examination by Bennett and committee members. The hearing was adjourned 
and the 32 committee witnesses and 25 defense witnesses who had been subpoenaed 
to testify were told that they could go home. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett is required to submit a final report to the committee. He said he would 
try to complete it within two weeks. Hamilton is entitled to submit a final 
brief in defense of Durenberger. The panel then will prepare its final report, 
which will recommend to the full Senate whether Durenberger should be 
exonerated, reprimanded, denounced, censured or expelled. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement Wednesday, Durenberger repeated his contention that he had 
acted "in good faith" in his financial affairs and pleaded for compassion and 
understanding from the quasi-judicial committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe, because I know you, that each of you will combine both good 
judgment and compassion in your decision," Durenberger told the six-member 
panel, of which he was once a member. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent my actions, inactions or failure to perceive the consequences of 
my actions have in any way reflected poorly on the Senate as an institution, or 
been uncomfortable or distressful to you as persons, I am sincerely sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger drew heavily on personal experience in his appeal. He described his 
upbringing in a Benedictine community in Minnesota, where he was the child of 
an academic family, and spoke of his struggle to raise four sons after his 
first wife's early death from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is determined to make amends for the ethics scandal by continuing to 
serve as an effective senator until his six-year term ends in 1994. Later, 
speaking to reporters, he firmly rejected any suggestion that he resign. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger repeatedly stressed to the committee that any improper actions were 
undertaken "on the advice of outside, independent attorneys." He said: "I have 
never sold my vote or improperly used my influence with a federal agency for my 
personal gain." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged having made mistakes in his dealings with a book company that 
paid him $100,000 over two years from fees collected from speaking engagements, 
an arrangement characterized by Bennett as a "clearly . . . unethical" evasion 
of rules limiting honorarium income. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger said he never attempted to hide the complex arrangements by which 
he sought to maximize income at a time of personal financial difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
"All these matters were done in the open and disclosed," he said. "There has 
been no obfuscation or cover-up. Would anyone in their right mind cook up a 
scheme to evade the Senate rules with an organization called Piranha Press?" 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger suggested that the Senate's ethics standards have been changing 
rapidly -- so much so that it has become virtually impossible for a 
"citizen-politician" who does not have substantial private income to make ends 
meet under present rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I needn't remind the six of you in particular that the U.S. Senate is no 
longer the place to which America brings its poor, its tired, its hungry masses 
to represent people like them and the rest of our country," he said. "While the 
pride of our democracy is still the citizen nature of our Legislature, we've 
made it awfully difficult for ordinary folks to be represented here by people 
just like them." 
</P>
<P>
The accusations against Durenberger were the first to be presented in public 
hearings before the Ethics Committee since 1981, when Sen. Harrison A. Williams 
Jr. (D-N.J.) was investigated for his role in the Abscam bribery scandal. 
Williams resigned after the committee recommended his expulsion from the 
Senate.

MOSCOW EASING ITS BLOCKADE, PREMIER OF LITHUANIA SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SECESSION: BUT ENDING OF ALL SANCTIONS APPARENTLY DEPENDS ON THE REPUBLIC'S 
SUSPENDING ITS INDEPENDENCE DECLARATION, AT LEAST DURING NEGOTIATIONS.

Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said after meeting with Kremlin 
leaders here on Wednesday that the Soviet government is relaxing its two-month 
economic blockade of the Baltic republic, a step she said should lead to 
negotiations on its independence. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene said Soviet officials agreed to supply more natural gas and some raw 
materials to Lithuania and to consider increasing fuel supplies for agriculture 
in an effort to get negotiations under way between Moscow and the secessionist 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
"From these talks, we understood the Soviet government has begun to trust us 
more, and we now trust it more," Prunskiene said after meeting with Prime 
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the chairman of the 
Congress of People's Deputies, the country's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with the official Soviet news agency Tass, Prunskiene said she was 
told the full blockade will be lifted as progress is made in political 
negotiations between Lithuania and the central government. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no doubts about the lifting of the economic blockade," Prunskiene 
told Tass. "This was stated quite explicitly." 
</P>
<P>
But the resumption of oil supplies and the lifting of other economic sanctions 
imposed in April still apparently depend on the Lithuanian Parliament's 
willingness to suspend its declaration of independence, at least during the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene, returning to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, told Radio Moscow's 
Interfax news service that her government "should very carefully discuss the 
question of freezing for the duration of possible negotiations with the Soviet 
Union the act of independence." 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has continued to insist that Lithuania suspend 
its March 11 declaration of independence as a condition for talks on the 
republic's secession. Until Prunskiene's meeting Wednesday with Ryzhkov, 
Lithuanian leaders had only offered to suspend the laws passed to implement the 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspension would cover the period of talks only, and that would be 
limited," Prunskiene said, adding that she will now try to win acceptance of 
this condition in Lithuania as the way to promote full-scale negotiations with 
Moscow. She has scheduled a special meeting of her Cabinet for Saturday to 
discuss the Soviet proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Vytautas Landsbergis, the Lithuanian president, also urged compromise as he 
reported on his meeting here with Gorbachev for an hour and a quarter on 
Tuesday in the company of the presidents of neighboring Estonia and Latvia, 
Arnold Ruutel and Anatolijs Gorbunovs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a moment when things should be done from both sides so that it does 
not look like the capitulation of one of them," Landsbergis told the Lithuanian 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"A clear desire is present to resolve the problem, not by forcing us to submit 
but by finding a mutually acceptable solution." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis said Lithuania should consider "certain maneuvers" that would 
permit Gorbachev to begin negotiations on Lithuanian independence. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be possible to find a way out of today's situation so that a true 
political dialogue could begin between Lithuania and the Soviet Union with a 
simultaneous ending of the blockade," he added, saying that "the sincere and 
constructive spirit of the discussion gives hope." 
</P>
<P>
The central government cut off Lithuania's entire oil supply, most of its 
natural gas and the majority of raw material to force the republic to rescind 
its declaration of independence. The punishing embargo has closed most 
factories, putting more than 26,000 people out of work, and is beginning to 
affect agriculture, a mainstay of the Lithuanian economy. 
</P>
<P>
The renewed deliveries will permit a major fertilizer plant and a number of 
other key factories to resume production, Lithuanian officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Ryzhkov told the three Baltic leaders Tuesday that the central 
government is ready for negotiations that would lead to full independence for 
their small republics, but they urged -- with some success -- that Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania at least consider continued membership in a greatly 
changed Soviet federation. 
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic republics were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 
1940 in a deal with Nazi Germany after two decades of independence. Lithuania 
has led the way in its efforts to regain its independence, but Estonia and 
Latvia are now following closely behind. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the Baltic states are likely to secede, Gorbachev has 
a "vision of a union of sovereign socialist states," Arkady A. Maslennikov, the 
president's press secretary, told journalists at a Kremlin briefing Wednesday, 
and he is intent on reaching a compromise with the Baltic states as a first 
step in this process. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev sees a new confederation replacing the Soviet Union, with each 
constituent republic sovereign and with each having a different relationship 
with the central government. 
</P>
<P>
The new Federal Council, made up of the presidents of the 15 republics and 
central government officials under Gorbachev's chairmanship, met for five hours 
Tuesday and set up a working group to draft alternative constitutions for such 
a confederation. 
</P>
<P>
In dealing with the Baltic issue, Gorbachev took "a gigantic step forward to 
offer an olive branch to the Lithuanians," Maslennikov said. "The president 
does not intend to insist on a degrading formula. He is speaking about the 
search for political solutions acceptable to all sides." 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov also said that significant progress has been made in this week's talks 
and that, if there were a positive Lithuanian response to the central 
government's proposal, there could be rapid progress. 
</P>
<P>
"We are beginning to move toward a solution," the prime minister told 
journalists during a break in the proceedings of the Supreme Soviet, the 
country's national legislature. "People are starting to understand that by 
choosing that path, they went into a dead end and they don't know how to get 
out. Now, it appears to me that they see this. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If our proposal is accepted, we will sit at the negotiating table and decide 
on how to settle our relations. . . . But it is up to them to decide. We have 
covered our part of the way."

THESE NAVAL OPERATIONS ARE COSMETIC -- AND FREE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Navy doctors are performing hundreds of free cosmetic surgeries at taxpayer 
expense on Navy personnel and their families -- a benefit rarely provided by 
private health insurance and specifically prohibited by Veterans Administration 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego alone, 544 free cosmetic operations were performed during the past 
two years. From 1986 to 1989, Navy doctors nationwide performed more than 1,800 
breast augmentations, face lifts, nose jobs, liposuctions and hair transplants 
-- operations that usually cost thousands of dollars apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials say these surgical procedures allow doctors to hone their skills 
and practice their craft in readiness for wartime. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that taxpayers should not foot the bill for military 
personnel to fine-tune their faces and physiques, especially when the 
government is trying to reduce military spending. If the doctors need practice, 
they say, they could help out the many indigent people who need but cannot 
afford reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inappropriate to spend taxpayers' dollars on medical operations that 
essentially are designed to allow people to be more stylish rather than to 
provide real substantive medical benefits," said Rep. Duncan Hunter 
(R-Coronado). "The ability to do a tummy tuck or nose bob is of relatively 
little medical benefit to a surgeon who really does intend to spend time 
working on military-related cases and combat-related cases." 
</P>
<P>
If Navy doctors need practice, Hunter said, they should operate on wounded 
refugees from countries such as Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery has been available to active-duty personnel, their spouses and 
children as well as retired members of the military at San Diego's Naval 
Hospital and three other facilities across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Baden, a San Diego Navy dental assistant, had her jaw surgically moved 
forward 6.5 millimeters. Still unhappy with her face, she underwent two nose 
jobs. Finally, in February, 39-year-old Baden, who joined the Navy five years 
ago, had her breasts enlarged. Soon after the last operation, Baden left the 
Navy. 
</P>
<P>
All of Baden's operations were performed at the Naval Hospital in Balboa Park 
free of charge, except for the breast implants Baden had to provide for the 
last surgery. Those cost $565, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The nominal price was the main reason she had the work done, Baden said. "I'm 
really pleased with the results. This just did something for my self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"These doctors in the Navy need experience like any other doctor," she added. 
"They appreciate the experience of having people to work on." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, cosmetic surgeries represent 12% of all plastic surgeries 
performed; they also represent almost 6% of all surgeries performed by the 
hospital's ophthalmologists and ear, nose and throat doctors, according to 
statistics obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue isn't whether or not we should be doing cosmetic surgery; my 
position is how much is reasonable. I suggest that 6% is reasonable and 12% is 
appropriate," said Rear Adm. Robert Halder, the commanding officer of the Navy 
Hospital, which has no plastic surgery residency program but does have three 
plastic surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force's eight and the Army's 22 plastic surgeons also do "aesthetic 
operations." Air Force doctors performed more than 540 such operations in 1988 
and more than 640 in 1989. Army doctors conducted more than 3,500 cosmetic 
surgeries at about 50 Army hospitals around the world in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Why in the world is an Army doctor doing a nose job? Because it's really 
critical for skills -- an Army doctor can't just sit there and do nothing for 
two years," said Virginia Stephanakis, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army surgeon 
general. "They really have to keep their skills up." 
</P>
<P>
In the civilian world, face lifts can cost as much as $6,000; hair replacements 
and tummy tucks usually go for no more than $5,000, breast augmentation for 
$2,500, according to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive 
Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say taxpayers should not have to pay for these surgeries, performed 
solely for vanity. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the hospital and residents' programs want to give young 
doctors experience, but it's absolutely unconscionable that I am paying for 
it," said Dr. Merrel Olesen, a plastic surgeon with the La Jolla Cosmetic 
Surgery Center. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven plastic surgeons are assigned to Navy hospitals in Bethesda, Md., 
Portsmouth, Va., Oakland and San Diego. Three work in San Diego. In 1989, the 
most recent year for which national figures are available, doctors at the four 
facilities performed 173 breast augmentations, 217 face lifts, 187 liposuctions 
and one hair transplant. 
</P>
<P>
To help facilitate the Navy Hospital's fat-removing surgeries, the hospital 
bought two liposuction machines, which cost $3,200 each. One was purchased in 
1988, the other in 1986, said Halder, who added that the hospital would have 
purchased the machines even if doctors did not perform cosmetic surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
In about 98% of the operations, the liposuction machine is used for cosmetic 
procedures, said Cmdr. Scott Barttelbort, chief of the plastic surgery division 
at the Navy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, the plastic surgeons are deluged by about 100 requests monthly, 
mostly from women who desire bigger breasts, wrinkle-free faces and smaller 
noses -- in that order, Barttelbort said. About 12% of the 1,138 plastic 
surgery procedures performed in two years beginning March, 1988, were performed 
for aesthetic reasons, said Halder. 
</P>
<P>
Two other departments at the Navy Hospital -- ophthalmology and the ear, nose, 
throat -- also conduct some cosmetic surgeries. During the two years beginning 
in March, 1988, ophthalmologists performed 189 operations to reduce wrinkles 
around the eyes. In the same period, ear, nose and throat physicians performed 
217 cosmetic surgeries, which make up about 5% of their total number of 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Veterans Affairs has issued regulations prohibiting such 
surgeries, which are considered elective and non-essential, spokesman Bob 
Stevens said.

INSURANCE: ROLLBACKS AND NEW, HIGHER RATES ARE LIKELY. CANDIDATES AND INDUSTRY 
BLAST DECISION.

<P>
Under a ruling by Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie Wednesday, some 
insurance companies likely will be ordered soon to rebate millions of dollars 
to California customers on 1988-89 premiums. But the companies probably could 
recoup that much and more later on in new, higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, in a long-awaited ruling on implementing Proposition 103, the 
landmark insurance initiative, left many questions unsettled and drew criticism 
from every side in the dispute over future insurance rates in the state. 
</P>
<P>
On rate rebates resulting from Proposition 103-mandated rollbacks, Gillespie 
set the permissible annual rate of return for the companies at 11.2% of equity 
and indicated she would order the rebates by next month, after hearings, from 
companies that had exceeded this profit level. 
</P>
<P>
Any such orders, however, would be subject to court appeal, possibly delaying 
rebate checks for months or years. 
</P>
<P>
On future rate regulation, meanwhile, Gillespie, an appointee of Gov. George 
Deukmejian, said the permissible annual rate of return could vary from 11.2% to 
as high as 19%. 
</P>
<P>
Although she did not indicate how regulators would evaluate where a company 
would be placed in that range, part of her decision apparently could open the 
way to major increases, not only in auto insurance but in other lines such as 
homeowner and commercial policies, which also are regulated under Proposition 
103. And the commissioner said companies could apply for "variances" from the 
range she set. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's 46-page ruling followed months of hearings on what the companies' 
rate of return should be, triggered by a state Supreme Court ruling altering 
the terms of Proposition 103, which was passed by voters in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In her decision Wednesday, Gillespie also served notice she would disallow some 
company expenses, such as political contributions and lobbying expenses, and 
cap others, such as executive salaries, in determining a company's allowable 
rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
This part of the decision was a move toward meeting concerns of many consumer 
groups, but it was soon lost in a furor that erupted over her rate-of-return 
rulings and the formal regulations she said would follow. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, Gillespie's ruling was being assailed generally, and leading the 
charge were the two major party nominees for California's first elected 
insurance commissioner, Democrat John Garamendi and Republican Wes Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi, a state senator from the Northern California community of Walnut 
Grove, said he feared the rebates "may be only pennies compared to the 
long-range rip-off that may be set in regulatory concrete." 
</P>
<P>
"We have grave concerns that the method of calculation of future rates may well 
lead to excessive premiums and high profits for insurance companies," he said. 
"It is wrong for this lame-duck appointed commissioner to set in concrete such 
an important issue before the voters have a chance to choose their commissioner 
in November. . . . The commissioner should not be guaranteeing profits for 
insurance companies." 
</P>
<P>
Bannister, owner of a Huntington Beach insurance agency, said, "I think people 
are sick and tired of all of this. There are other ways to lower premiums. They 
(Gillespie and others in the state Insurance Department) don't seem to be doing 
anything positive. They just seem to be stirring the water all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Bannister added that he would not feel bound, if elected commissioner, by any 
regulations Gillespie promulgates now. 
</P>
<P>
But some experts in state administrative law pointed out Wednesday that once 
regulations are validated, a new commissioner could only change them through an 
elaborate hearings procedure that could take months. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's special attorney for implementation of Proposition 103, Karl 
Rubinstein, responded to Garamendi and Bannister by saying that Gillespie had 
purposefully built a range of options into future rating decisions and said he 
was convinced that either man could keep the regulations and yet follow the 
policies he desired. 
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner candidates' criticisms were only part of the reaction 
Wednesday. Criticisms cascaded from everywhere, including from insurance 
industry representatives who complained that Gillespie was setting too 
complicated a system into motion. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is that California is going to have a very complicated process for 
obtaining rate changes," said Judith Mintel, an attorney for State Farm. "Many 
areas (of her ruling) are unclear and will be in dispute. It is apt to be a 
very costly process." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Conneely, president of the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, a 
major lobbying arm of the industry, said Gillespie's rulings were "marred by 
inconsistencies" and that her 11.2% profit standard for deciding on the 
rollbacks was too "rigid." 
</P>
<P>
"This ruling really isn't final," Conneely added. "Somebody will litigate this, 
in the interest of their financial viability." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie did not challenge this point. Her news release said she "expects she 
will have to litigate to enforce the new system." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those persistently critical of the industry joined in the assault on 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said the ruling "gives some real hope that 
California consumers will, in fact, see rebates." But he said the other part of 
Gillespie's decision, setting a profit range for future rate increases, "is a 
total surrender to the insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Under those rules, it is unlikely any insurance would ever have a rate reduced 
by the commissioner -- as if Proposition 103 had never passed," the attorney 
general said. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Snyder, West Coast director of the Consumers Union, called Gillespie's 
ruling "a sleight of hand and a shell game. We'll see a minuscule rollback and 
then open sesame in the prior approval of rates." 
</P>
<P>
And Harvey Rosenfield, author of Proposition 103, said that "what Gillespie 
gives us with the rollback she takes away in the form of huge future rate 
increases." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's ruling came after the hearings before Administrative Hearing Judge 
William Fernandez in San Bruno. Fernandez rendered his own opinion last month 
on what the commissioner ought to do. But in Gillespie's ruling, filled with 
complicated language, she rejected parts of what Fernandez had to say and 
refashioned things in her own way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie will put Wednesday's ruling into 
precise regulatory language and then hold hearings in July on several specific 
companies held to be representative of the various kinds of firms in the 
business. Rollback orders are then supposed to follow, although because of 
legal appeals it is doubtful whether many Californians will see rebate checks 
by the time a new elected commissioner takes over in January.

'BLOBS' SUGGEST A BLACK HOLE AT CENTER OF GALAXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Giant "blobs" of material have been discovered around a mysterious object near 
the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, leading scientists to believe they may be 
getting their best look yet at one of the most baffling objects in the universe 
-- a black hole. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't possible to actually see a black hole, and no one has been able to 
prove that they exist, because a black hole would be so dense that even light 
would not escape its gravity. 
</P>
<P>
But black holes exist in theory -- and probably in fact -- as part of the 
legacy of Albert Einstein. Despite years of searching, they remain the most 
elusive trophies in the astronomical zoo. 
</P>
<P>
But armed with increasingly powerful tools, including giant radio telescopes, 
scientists believe that they are getting closer to proving that black holes do 
exist, even if they cannot be seen. 
</P>
<P>
The search consists mainly of looking for evidence of the kind of violent 
activity that should take place in a black hole's immediate neighborhood. 
Theoretically, as the black hole captures material within its gravitational 
reach, atoms and molecules literally should be ripped apart, sending out 
various types of radiation that can be studied from as far away as Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, scientists told the American Astronomical Society meeting here that 
they believe that they have identified a series of giant "blobs" -- most likely 
clouds of hot, charged gas particles -- around an object known as Sagittarius 
A, which had been discovered previously by an infrared telescope. 
</P>
<P>
The "blobs," they said, were probably created when matter was ripped apart as 
it plunged toward the black hole. Each of the giant blobs measures nearly a 
trillion miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
They hope that additional study will unmask Sagittarius A and prove it to be 
the long-sought but never seen black hole that scientists suspect lurks at the 
heart of the Milky Way Galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
The research is being carried out by Farhad Yusef-Zadeh of Northwestern 
University in Evanston, Ill., Mark Morris of UCLA and Ron Ekers of the 
Australian Telescope. Their main tool in the search for the black hole is the 
Very Large Array, a series of large radio telescopes in the New Mexico desert. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we have seen these blobs," Yusef-Zadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
Yusef-Zadeh said he cannot tell yet if the blobs are being pulled toward 
Sagittarius A or blown away by hot gases similar to the solar wind. But he is 
confident that the research he presented Wednesday goes a long way toward 
proving that a black hole does lie at the center of any galaxy, and in our own 
Milky Way, the most likely candidate is Sagittarius A. 
</P>
<P>
One problem that has been particularly vexing for astronomers is that the 
central area of the galaxy is so clouded with dust and gas that it is not 
possible to see objects near the galactic center. Thus observations are limited 
primarily to radiation that can pass through the dusty shield, such as radio 
waves and X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
So for the last few years, scientists have used giant radio telescopes to study 
the galactic center, and their search for the black hole has been generally 
narrowed to two objects. One is a tight cluster of stars, called IRS 16, and 
the other is Sagittarius A. 
</P>
<P>
Yusef-Zadeh presented evidence Wednesday that he said strongly supports 
Sagittarius as the prime candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The most compelling evidence in addition to the blobs, he said, is a cloud of 
dust and gas that surrounds a nearby star, called IRS 7. "'Radiographs," which 
are similar to photographs, produced by the scientists show that the cloud of 
dust is being swept past the star much the same as the tail of a comet is 
pushed back by the solar wind. 
</P>
<P>
The cloud is pointing directly away from Sagittarius A, just as the tail of a 
comet points away from the sun. That indicates that powerful interstellar winds 
-- such as those expected to be produced by a very energetic object such as a 
black hole -- are in fact coming from Sagittarius A. That clearly suggests that 
Sagittarius is the black hole that scientists have been looking for, 
Yusef-Zadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, who are at the forefront in the search for a black hole at the 
center of the Milky Way, have been alloted time on an even larger radio 
telescope, called the Very Large Baseline Array, which is under construction in 
New Mexico. Yusef-Zadeh said he hopes that powerful instrument, which actually 
will consist of many telescopes linked together so that they will act as one, 
will finally resolve the issue.

BURNING JERSEY ON MOUND MAY COST LITTLE LEAGUE MANAGER'S JOB 
</P>

<P>
The manager of an Anaheim Hills Little League team faced possible dismissal 
Wednesday after he reportedly turned a pitcher's mound into a pyre, burning 
what looked like the opposing pitcher's jersey while trying to rally his 
players for a big game. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who witnessed the fire have complained to Little League officials, and 
the 12-year-old pitcher who saw the jersey set ablaze apparently was so rattled 
by the incident he committed an error that allowed a run to score, and his 
previously undefeated team lost. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jackson, district administrator for 18 Little Leagues in Orange County, 
said league officials will consider dismissing Randy L. Pangborn, 38, of 
Anaheim, the manager of the Yankees and a board member of the Anaheim Hills 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate the burning of a uniform. It is like burning the American 
flag," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and league officials met Wednesday night at an elementary school to 
review the incident and consider whether to dismiss Pangborn, who was briefly 
suspended by the league two weeks ago for making rude remarks to an umpire. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Hills Little League board members and Pangborn, 38, who is also the 
league's director of fields, declined comment about the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the incident involving the jersey began about 5 p.m. Monday, 
half an hour before the Yankees and the undefeated A's -- teams made up of boys 
ages 10 to 12 -- took the field at Crescent Intermediate School on Gerda Drive. 
During warm-ups, Pangborn and his coach propped up a green and yellow jersey, 
similar to those worn by the opposing team, on the pitcher's mound with a 
stake. On the back was number 17, the number of Todd Sterman, star hurler for 
the A's. 
</P>
<P>
With two players to block the wind, the Yankees' coach, encouraged by Pangborn, 
set the jersey on fire with a lighter, witnesses said. As it burned, Pangborn 
conducted infield practice, occasionally pausing to yell at Sterman and to urge 
his own team on to victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd, did you see the number on the jersey?" witnesses quoted Pangborn as 
saying. "We are going to burn the A's down because the Yankees are fired up." 
It was not determined if action would be taken against Pangborn's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Parents said the attempt to psych out the opponents apparently worked -- the 
A's lost 3 to 1. The Yankees scored all their runs in the first inning, helped 
by errors, including a wild throw by Sterman that sailed over the first 
baseman's head. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, shocked parents called league president Teresa Dean, who contacted 
the Anaheim Fire Department. A fire official said there appears to have been no 
violation of arson laws and that proving someone set an illegal fire is 
difficult, unless the person is caught in the act by authorities.

MALATHION: WEDNESDAY'S FLIGHT OVER COMPTON WAS LAST ONE SCHEDULED FOR LOS 
ANGELES COUNTY. BUT EXPERTS SAY THEY CAN ONLY HOPE THE HIATUS OF NEW FLY 
DISCOVERIES WILL CONTINUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Late Wednesday night, a squadron of helicopters lifted off from Long Beach and 
flew a one-hour sortie over the city of Compton, carrying a final dose of 
malathion to fight a flare-up of Mexican fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
The mission was something of a milestone in a long and frustrating aerial war 
that has been waged over Southern California. After 10 consecutive months of 
regular helicopter excursions -- first against Medflies and more recently 
against the Mexfly -- the raid Wednesday was the final scheduled malathion 
spraying for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no celebration. State officials can only hope that their luck 
will hold and the hiatus of new fly discoveries will continue. 
</P>
<P>
If more flies are found, more spraying will probably be ordered, and experts 
say it will not be until late July that they can claim with confidence that the 
infestations have been eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to call it a victory," said Don Henry, chief deputy director of 
the eradication campaign. "We still have to get through the middle of July. 
Then you'll see us a little less somber." 
</P>
<P>
At its height, the state's spraying campaign covered 536 square miles and 
reached into parts of five counties in Southern California. The sound of 
helicopters, rattling windows and sending pets scurrying for cover, became 
commonplace for more than 4 million Southern Californians, some of whom angrily 
fired back at the state's aerial assault with a flurry of noisy protests and 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last month, the war against the Mediterranean fruit fly and its kin, 
the Mexican fruit fly, has become quiet. 
</P>
<P>
The last malathion spraying for the Medfly in Los Angeles and Orange counties 
was conducted May 30 and no Medflies have been found in six weeks -- the 
longest stretch since the beginning of the infestation last July. No Mexican 
fruit flies have been found since May 8. 
</P>
<P>
With the final spraying in Compton, only 64 square miles in San Bernardino 
County, El Cajon in San Diego County and the Woodcrest area in Riverside County 
have been left with the dubious honor of being the last in the spray zone. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the noticeable deceleration of the unpopular spraying program, the 
political heat continues. The Los Angeles City Council has been considering 
barring the state from using any airport in the city to launch its squadron of 
malathion-bearing helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, demonstrations and press conferences attacking the spraying 
campaign have persisted, although at nowhere near the frantic pace of spring 
when the spray zone was growing in leaps and bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are relieved and tired. They're taking a breather," said Patty 
Prickett, coordinator of the community group Residents Against Spraying 
Pesticides. "But there's no way we are going to give up until we know this 
won't ever happen again." 
</P>
<P>
The spraying campaign over the last 10 months has been the largest mounted in 
Southern California, involving more than 480 workers and costing an estimated 
$36 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics of the campaign have been mind-boggling, even for veterans of 
the fruit fly wars. About 47,000 gallons of malathion have been dropped on 
Southern California. Close to 4 billion sterile Medflies have been released to 
breed the pest out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
The questions about the success of the eradication program have persisted 
through these quiet weeks, driven by two disturbing factors that have left even 
eradication program officials wary and uncertain -- a shortage of sterile flies 
and the warm weather ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The state's Medfly eradication program has been plagued with a serious shortage 
of sterile flies, which are released by the millions to disrupt the breeding 
cycle of the wild Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
Because of production problems at three sterile-fly breeding facilities in 
Hawaii, the program has been receiving about a third fewer flies than what 
scientists have recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Rice, one of the five entomologists serving on the state's Medfly 
Science Advisory Panel, has said that the shortage could open a "window of 
opportunity" for the wild flies to breed. 
</P>
<P>
Eradication project officials also have expressed concern about the shortage, 
but add that the lack of flies is an encouraging sign that no serious damage 
has been done. 
</P>
<P>
With many warm months ahead, offering ideal conditions for both flies, there 
also is the possibility of new discoveries popping up any day. 
</P>
<P>
James Carey, a UC Davis entomologist and another member of the Medfly Science 
Advisory Panel, said the historical pattern of a Medfly population surge in 
late summer almost guarantees that more flies will be found. 
</P>
<P>
Carey said that during the last 15 years in Southern California, only 9% of 
Medflies have been trapped from January through July, while 69% have been found 
in August, September and October. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on that pattern, I'm not optimistic," Carey said. "This is the lull 
before the storm. The only time I will be optimistic is if we go through the 
summer and fall without a single fly. Then I'll be a believer."

STATE SPEEDS UP FUNDING OF SOUTHLAND ROAD WORK; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 111: TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION ALLOCATES MONEY TO BE RAISED BY HIGHER 
GASOLINE TAXES FOR THE CENTURY FREEWAY AND OTHER PROJECTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Century Freeway and dozens of other road projects in Southern California 
became the first to benefit Wednesday from the voters' decision June 5 to 
endorse a gasoline tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing to get work delayed by funding shortages back on schedule, the 
California Transportation Commission approved $257 million in backlogged 
projects scattered throughout the state. But most of the initial funding went 
to the south, with the biggest chunks -- totaling $118.5 million -- slated for 
construction on two phases of the Century Freeway and on state routes 30 and 
330 in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Lesser amounts went to other road work stretching from Ventura County to San 
Diego County. "We intend to accelerate as fast as we can," said commission 
Chairman William Leonard. " . . . The public didn't support (the gas tax 
increase) in order to put money in the bank." 
</P>
<P>
Highway officials had been forced to delay funding for a list of projects 
during the last year as the state's 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax became 
inadequate to meet the transportation demands of a rapidly expanding 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"If the voters had not approved the tax increase, the delays would have 
continued and the 105 (Century Freeway) would have come to a screeching halt," 
said Charles J. O'Connell, a Caltrans deputy district director in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The California Transportation Commission allocates funds for state 
transportation projects; Caltrans, or the Department of Transportation, 
administers them and makes recommendations to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
On June 5, the voters approved Proposition 111, a ballot measure that modified 
the state's spending limit and permitted gas tax increases. Motorists will 
begin paying a 5-cent-per-gallon increase on Aug. 1 and then 1-cent-per-gallon 
increases every January for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
The tax hikes are designed to help finance a 10-year, $18.5-billion 
transportation program that allows the state to catch up with backlogged 
projects and start new ones to formulate a multifaceted plan for easing traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are in a very exciting stage here in California," said Assemblyman 
Jim Costa (D-Fresno). "In the next four or five years we are going to be 
designing some innovative transportation strategies . . . that I think may lead 
the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Voters will begin to see the effects of the tax increase as the commission 
continues to authorize highway construction projects throughout the year. By 
the end of 1990, officials estimate they will have approved $1 billion worth of 
new road projects. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell said the commission's decision to make the Century Freeway one of its 
first priorities ensures that "we have a reasonable chance" of completing the 
massive project in time for its scheduled opening in September, 1993. The funds 
approved for the Century Freeway totaled $65.9 million.

"You might say Caltrans management is aware that all of the pieces of the 105 
(Century) fit together. These projects don't stand alone; they have an impact 
one on the other . . . if one is postponed you're really looking at delaying 
the opening of a $2-billion project," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in the spring of 1982, the 17.3 miles of roadway between Norwalk and the 
eastern edge of Los Angeles International Airport will, upon completion, be the 
most expensive stretch of freeway ever built in the United States. The total 
price tag is expected to be more than $2 billion for six lanes of freeway for 
regular traffic, two lanes for buses and car pools, a light rail line in the 
freeway median and replacement housing for those displaced by the highway's 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The funds approved Wednesday not only permit the Century Freeway construction 
to continue but allow Caltrans to clean up a toxic waste dump that had 
embroiled the agency in a dispute with the Catholic Church. The expenditures 
authorized by the commission included $22 million to remove and seal a dump in 
the Century Freeway construction zone near St. Frances X. Cabrini Catholic 
Church and parish school in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the church has been pushing for removal of the dump only to hear 
from Caltrans that the costs were so high that the church might have to share 
in them. In recent weeks, however, officials said they found a way to complete 
the project without exceeding their original construction costs estimates for 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they came up with a good solution," said Father David O'Connell, the 
parish priest. He is not related to the Caltrans official. "I think the public 
put quite a bit of pressure on Caltrans and I think they did respond to the 
people. It proves if you get mad enough sometimes you can get a lot done." 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $43.9 million authorized for the Century Freeway will finance the 
construction of a transit station and a part of the freeway near Inglewood and 
Lemoli Avenues. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino County, approval of $52.6 million for construction work on 
routes 330 and 30 gives the go-ahead for a project in the East San 
Bernardino-Highland Valley that would extend the existing Crosstown Freeway 
(California 30) 3.7 miles from its terminus at Arden-Highland Avenue to 5th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
The same project also provides for an extension of California 330 from City 
Creek Canyon to its new junction with the Crosstown Freeway in the city of 
Highland, a distance of about 1.7 miles. With the construction of 23 bridges 
and an extensive drainage system, it is the single biggest freeway contract 
ever authorized for that area of the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAJOR ROAD PROJECTS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the major road projects in Southern California approved by the 
California Transportation Commission: 
</P>
<P>
$43.9 million for the construction of a transit station near the Century 
Freeway in the vicinity of Inglewood and Lemoli avenues and another $22 million 
to remove and dispose of hazardous waste in the Century Freeway corridor near 
Western and Normandie avenues. 
</P>
<P>
$52.6 million in San Bernardino County to extend the Crosstown Freeway (Route 
30) 3.7 miles from its current terminus at Arden-Highland Avenue to 5th Street. 
The same project would also extend Route 330 1.7 miles from City Creek Canyon 
to its new junction with the Crosstown Freeway in Highland. 
</P>
<P>
$9.6 million to widen Route 126 in Ventura County from two to four lanes west 
of Castaic Junction from Powell Road to Center Street. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, $3.8 million to widen Route 78 in Oceanside from four to 
six lanes from the intersection with Route 5 to three miles east of College 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Foothill Freeway (Route 210) to undergo $2.1 million in roadway 
rehabilitation and bridge repairs on a stretch from Paxton Street to just east 
of Wheatland Avenue.

ALGERIA VOTE SENDS SHOCK WAVES THROUGH FRANCE

<P>
The unexpected victory of an Islamic fundamentalist party in Algerian elections 
sent shock waves Wednesday throughout a political establishment in France that 
still has strong cultural and emotional ties to the former French colony. 
</P>
<P>
The victory of the Islamic Salvation Front, created only 15 months ago after 
massive anti-government riots in Algiers and other cities, also promises to 
have profound impact on the French political scene, where the growing extreme 
right-wing National Front Party has made a major issue out of Arab immigrants 
coming from former French colonies in North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider it as one of the most important events of the decade," National 
Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said of the Algerian election. In a telephone 
interview Wednesday, he described the victory by the Islamic Salvation Front as 
a "detonator" that will likely lead more Algerians to leave for France. 
</P>
<P>
"There is already a strong concentration of Algerians in France," Le Pen said. 
"If there is trouble in Algeria, many more will try to come here. The vast 
majority of French are opposed to any increase in immigration." 
</P>
<P>
The main concerns expressed by French and French-Algerian people interviewed 
after the election results were announced Wednesday are fears that the newly 
powerful Islamic fundamentalist movement in Algeria will spread to neighboring 
countries of Morocco and Tunisia in the North African Maghreb and even to the 
Muslim population inside France itself. 
</P>
<P>
Others stated fears that the French language will lose its toehold in Africa to 
the Arabic tongue embraced by the fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible blow to Francophony," said Mouloud Chalah, 39, president of 
Radio Beur, a station aimed at the French-speaking Algerian population here. 
</P>
<P>
But even stronger, perhaps, is the fear that France will lose touch with its 
former colony, which has figured so prominently in the literature of Albert 
Camus and other writers. What India was to the British Empire, Algeria was to 
France. The United States' painful withdrawal from Vietnam was, in some ways, 
minor compared to the emotional French severance from its favorite colony in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the immediate French reaction to the election results, although 
they concerned only municipal and provincial posts, was funereal, a remembrance 
of things past. 
</P>
<P>
"The sun rose over a different North Africa on Wednesday when Algerian 
authorities recognized the clear victory of the Islamacists," the influential 
Paris newspaper Le Monde editorialized on the front page of its Wednesday 
afternoon editions. It continued: 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, a movement about which we know nothing with respect to its 
attitude toward France, will be associated with governing public affairs. The 
symbolism is so strong that one has a tendency to forget that these are only 
local elections." 
</P>
<P>
Officially, French President Francois Mitterrand, speaking at a press 
conference on the island of Mauritius, expressed hope that France will continue 
to have good relations with its former colony. 
</P>
<P>
"A people living in a sovereign state are free to make their own choices," 
Mitterrand said. "We cannot discuss the wishes of the French people with regard 
to Algeria. That is for the Algerians." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, however, Mitterrand aides said they are concerned that the results 
will exacerbate popular concerns about the growth of the Muslim population in 
France and bolster the National Front. 
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, 785,000 Algerian immigrants live in France. 
However, that figure does not include an estimated 2 million other French 
residents, the beurs, who are of Algerian origin. In addition, about 300,000 to 
1 million Algerians reside in France illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the 1.3 million former French colonialists in Algeria, the 
so-called pieds noirs (black feet) who now live in France, the Algerian-linked 
population forms an especially sensitive part of French society. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone sneezes in Algeria, France catches a cold," commented Omar 
Mokhtari, editor of a bi-weekly Algerian newspaper published in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other Algerians living in France, including prominent members of the 
Islamic religious community, Mokhtari said Wednesday that he is "astonished and 
concerned" over the fundamentalist victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It poses a peril for Algeria and for Algerians in France," Mokhtari said. The 
biggest fear, he said, is that the results will boost the already increasing 
political status of the National Front and Le Pen, who as a paratrooper fought 
against Algerian independence. 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls have shown the National Front being supported by 18% of the 
French, an all-time high for the political party that includes royalist and 
anti-Semitic elements. 
</P>
<P>
A measure of the impact of the Algerian vote may come as early as Sunday, when 
a National Front candidate faces a Socialist Party opponent in a highly 
publicized runoff election in Villeurbanne, a suburb of Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Algerians account for a major proportion of the estimated 4 million Muslims of 
all nationalities and origins who live in France. In recent years, Islam has 
become the second largest religious grouping in France, behind Roman 
Catholicism but ahead of Protestantism. The growing population of Algerians and 
other Muslims has helped fuel anti-immigrant and racist sentiments. The 
right-wing National Front Party has capitalized on those sentiments.

Whipped by tough words from Arab hard-liners and the installation of a new 
rightist government in Israel, a prickly wind is pushing through the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Gusts of inflammatory talk are building, and the rhetoric is warlike and blunt. 
According to Western diplomats in the region, the rhetoric reflects genuine 
concerns on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"What is coming is not a limited danger but a danger of destiny," Syrian 
President Hafez Assad declared earlier this week, calling for Arab solidarity. 
He spoke of conflict and said the Arabs will win on the strength of their 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel is still advanced over Arabs technologically and could inflict on them 
human disasters in the case of war," Assad told his Parliament. "But Arabs, 
with what they own, can exchange the disasters in the same way. . . . Because 
the Arabs have . . . depth (in population), which Israel lacks, the exchange of 
disasters would have more weight on the Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
The tension began tightening three months ago when Israel's national unity 
government shattered over deep differences on peace talks with the 
Palestinians. Weeks later, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened to "burn 
half of Israel" with chemical weapons if his country were attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, dangerous episodes have incited further alarm. A deranged Israeli 
civilian shot to death seven Palestinian workers near Tel Aviv in an unprovoked 
attack, spurring an outburst of violence in Israeli-occupied territories. Then, 
in a brazen response, guerrillas of a radical faction of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization tried to raid Israeli beaches; the attack was thwarted 
by Israeli forces who killed four of the raiders. 
</P>
<P>
On top of it all came the steady immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel, stirring 
Arab fears of a bolstered enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Anxiety and aggressiveness are clear even to outsiders in the Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I've picked a good time to go," a retiring Western diplomat told a recent 
visitor to Amman, Jordan, expressing fear that the Middle East is moving 
towards another of its periodic wars. 
</P>
<P>
Said an American arms salesman who travels widely in the region: "It's getting 
goosey out there. I haven't seen it this bad before. The Arabs think Israel 
needs a war, and they're getting hostile as hell." 
</P>
<P>
A statement Monday by the PLO on the guerrilla raid, received in full text here 
Tuesday, termed the climate an uncertain "state of no-peace, no-war" and 
claimed that the PLO has opted for peace. 
</P>
<P>
But the statement also fanned the talk of war, saying, "Everybody knows that 
the (new) Israeli government is preparing to launch a new war, to escalate its 
oppression and massacre of Palestinians, to attack the Arab countries and to 
expand its settlement of our occupied land." 
</P>
<P>
Added Faisal Husseini, a pro-PLO activist in East Jerusalem: "I think it is a 
government of war, and I think the decisions of such a government will be a 
decision of war." 
</P>
<P>
But Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister of the new government, rejects the Arab 
chorus that his is a war Cabinet. He told reporters: "We will definitely work 
with all our power for peace. . . . Our call for direct talks is not an empty 
declaration but a real and sincere appeal to our neighbors to turn their backs 
to hostility and war and proceed to the negotiating table. " 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy guidelines of the new government, however, Arab calls for an 
international peace conference are not acceptable, nor is the Palestinian 
demand for sovereignty over the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be crazy on our part to agree to any concession in the area which is 
the soft belly of the land of Israel when around us we have a hostile ring that 
has unprecedented military power," the prime minister said, adding that he will 
continue Jewish settlement of the territories. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's political nemesis, Shimon Peres, who led the Labor Party out of the 
national unity government, belittled the prospects for peace under the new 
regime. "Its composition and guidelines are not bringing peace," he remarked. 
"It has no ability to change, has no joy of hope. It is a sad government for 
its members and a sorrowful government for Israel." 
</P>
<P>
War scenarios abound in the Middle East: 
</P>
<P>
Israel, threatened by advances in military technology by hostile Arab nations 
-- particularly missile-delivery systems -- orders a preemptive strike to knock 
out the systems. Iraq, mentioned as a likely target, has vowed to retaliate 
with its own "weapons of mass destruction" if Israel attacks with similar arms. 
</P>
<P>
The potential collapse of the U.S. dialogue with the PLO and the rise of 
radical leadership in the organization leads to stepped-up guerrilla attacks 
across Israeli borders, prompting an Israeli response. 
</P>
<P>
Determination to put down the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories 
prompts an Israeli military operation to push the populace out of the West Bank 
and into Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
An outbreak of fighting between Arab enemies -- Syria and Iraq, for instance -- 
drags Israel into the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Military analysts say the next Middle East war will be the worst, with all 
combatants now maintaining missiles and high-performance fighter-bombers, and 
Israel and several Arab states reported to have chemical warheads. Bringing 
firepower on a distant target would take a matter of an hour or less. 
</P>
<P>
And ultimately, Israel is reputed to have nuclear warheads as well. The 
prospects for the loss of civilian life in such a conflict would be high. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not interested in any wars, in any confrontations with our neighbors," 
Shamir told Israel Radio before the formation of his government. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders say the same. 
</P>
<P>
"We remain committed to work alongside all local and international forces to 
realize a just and comprehensive peace in the region. . . ," proclaimed 
Monday's PLO statement. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Middle East is clearly in a dangerous passage. The 
pressure-release of peace talks -- or even talks about talks -- under the 
formula supported by the Bush Administration appears dead. Shamir rejects the 
tacit PLO involvement in such talks. His favored proposal -- to make peace with 
Israel's Arab neighbors one by one, following the example of Egypt -- has so 
far stirred no open Arab interest. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. dialogue with the PLO collapses over the Palestinians' refusal to 
specifically condemn last month's abortive beach raid, Yasser Arafat's 
organization could become a loose cannon again. Regional tension and war talk 
are likely to continue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, the United States and the Soviet Union controlled the arms 
race in the Mideast because they provided most of the weaponry. But in recent 
years, they have lost control as their regional influence declined. Now, many 
Mideast nations have their own arms industries. Israel, Iraq, Syria, Saudi 
Arabia and Iran all have ballistic missiles. Israel is believed to have nuclear 
and chemical weapons. Iraq and Syria have chemical weapons, and Iraq could have 
nuclear weapons within the decade. Egypt is believed to have revived its 
chemical arms program. And Libya also may be producing poison gas.

CHENEY URGES DEFENSE ALTERNATIVES IF GORBACHEV FALTERS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: THE BACKUP PLANS WOULD PROVIDE FOR MORE FUNDING AND RETAIN MORE FORCES.

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, the Bush Administration's most vocal skeptic on 
the Soviet Union's reform campaign, has quietly launched an effort to draft 
alternative U.S. defense plans that could be activated quickly if Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's perestroika policy abruptly collapses or founders. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's drafting of a fallback plan is spurred by growing concerns about the 
Soviet president's political survival, given that nation's mounting economic 
problems and domestic unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We are thinking about a more complex set of options than just one, single, 
good-news scenario," Cheney said in a recent interview with The Times. "We have 
to take into account (the fact) that events may not unfold in a constantly 
progressive, optimistic fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed you may have to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, we cannot go forward with 
continued reduction in light of recent developments,' " Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
The new backup defense budgets would provide for more funding and retain more 
forces than the $1.5-trillion five-year budget Cheney presented to Congress in 
January, Pentagon officials say. 
</P>
<P>
They could be sent to Congress at a moment's notice if Gorbachev's program of 
troop withdrawals and defense cutbacks are curtailed or canceled, or if the 
Soviet Union plunges into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney launched the planning for the alternative "bad news" budgets Monday in a 
meeting with the military's 10 principal field commanders at the Pentagon. He 
is expected to conduct a series of meetings throughout the summer to draft the 
larger defense-spending plans. The dimensions of the alternative budgets are 
expected to emerge by the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The move is certain to be controversial on Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers 
have been clamoring for more defense budget cuts and thus a larger "peace 
dividend." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, however, even many of Congress' most ardent defense 
budget-cutters have expressed concerns about the Soviet position on 
independence for the Baltic states, growing economic problems and the prospect 
of slower-than-expected progress on the reduction of Soviet forces. 
</P>
<P>
Among the scenarios that drive Cheney's latest budget exercise are the prospect 
of Gorbachev's political collapse, a tailspin in the Soviet economy or the 
sudden and violent dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet economy is a very important theme in this," said one senior defense 
official. Under one scenario that could justify a change of the Pentagon's 
spending plan, the Soviet economy would revert to heavy-defense production as a 
spur to its economy. "You'd have to wonder why, under that circumstance, we're 
beating our swords into plowshares," said the official. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney last year sparked intense controversy by suggesting that Gorbachev could 
be toppled and replaced by a Soviet leader hostile to the United States. In 
spite of his doubts, however, he initiated a series of budget reviews which, 
over a year and a half, cut more than $250 billion from the military services' 
original 1990-1994 spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers and analysts have called the spending blueprint a timid response 
to a profound reduction in the military threat. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney has said that his spending plan, which proposes to shrink the budget 
by 2% each year for the next five years, was based on a "rosy scenario." The 
declining budgets assume that Gorbachev remains in power, that the strategic 
arms treaty sharply reducing long-range nuclear weapons has been signed and 
implemented, that the Soviets have withdrawn all their forces from Eastern 
Europe and that the Warsaw Pact has become "a relic of history." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most optimistic possible outcome," said Cheney in a recent 
interview. "But we also want to be in a position to say, what happens if you 
don't get a CFE (conventional forces in Europe) agreement, what happens if the 
Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe stops, what happens if for one reason or 
another the START agreement is not concluded, or that there are developments in 
some other part of the world that require reconstitution of significant U.S. 
force? 
</P>
<P>
"We in fact are building a long-range plan" that would take such setbacks into 
account, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and other officials said the new plans would focus on which forces must 
be preserved to respond to threats. Among the important questions are which 
Army units can be demobilized or removed from Europe and when, and which naval 
forces could not be replaced quickly if they were mothballed ahead of schedule.

SOVIETS HOPE PARTY CONGRESS CAN MEND PERESTROIKA RIFT; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNISTS: POLICIES ARE BEING REVISED TO GIVE THE PLATFORM BROADER APPEAL, AN 
OFFICIAL SAID.

The Soviet Communist Party, torn by more internal dissent today than at any 
time since the 1920s, is struggling to avert an open split among its members 
over the course of perestroika, the party's chief ideologist said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim A. Medvedev, the party secretary for ideology and a key adviser to 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said the party leadership would use the 
forthcoming party congress, called to make crucial decisions on future reforms, 
to consolidate support for perestroika -- even, it appears, at the cost of 
bolder moves. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said that the party's platform, introduced in draft form three months 
ago, is being rewritten in as broad a form as possible, with proposals from 
across the political spectrum to avoid defections to either the left or the 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed new party rules are also being revised further, he said, to allow 
active dissent by members -- but without impairing the party's ability to act. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making all efforts to prevent the fragmentation of the party prior to, 
during and even after the congress," Medvedev said. "In working on major 
documents, including the platform and the rules, we are trying to develop the 
broadest possible basis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We will set certain boundaries -- the socialist choice (for the country's 
political and economic system) and certain social and ideological values -- but 
they will be broad enough to unite all forces of perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
The future of the Soviet Communist Party, which has ruled the country since the 
1917 Bolshevik Revolution, is clearly in the balance, and the party leadership 
is confronted with choices between the policies it wants to pursue and the 
danger that the party will split over them. 
</P>
<P>
The search for an early compromise is important, for it will shape both the 
decisions of the delegates and their election of a new party leadership at the 
congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has been pressed hard by party conservatives for a pre-congress purge 
of radicals, but little appears to have been done to put into effect 
instructions from the party's policy-making Central Committee for a review of 
the membership. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Gorbachev is challenged aggressively from the left to act 
more boldly, even at the risk of breaking with traditional Marxism-Leninism and 
driving conservatives out of the party. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand for consolidation," Medvedev said. "We are against the disintegration 
and splintering of the party." 
</P>
<P>
But Medvedev, who is also a member of the ruling Politburo, said the party's 
political elasticity does have limits, and he acknowledged that members of the 
Democratic Platform, a liberal group still operating within the party, might 
well quit to form a party of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"There is every opportunity to avoid a split in the party, but unfortunately 
not everything depends on us," he said. "As for members who espouse alternative 
platforms, if they are for constructive dialogue, fine. If other . . . 
interests prevail, that is a matter for those comrades." 
</P>
<P>
A greater threat has come from the right, however, with the threatened 
formation of an independent Russian Communist Party, which would be dominated 
by conservatives opposed to many of Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
To preempt that move, the party leadership announced over the weekend that, in 
a major policy reversal, it would form an official Russian Communist Party, 
presumably loyal to Gorbachev. Its founding congress will open here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev, who in the past strongly opposed the division of the party into 
ethnic units, contended Wednesday that, in fact, it would become a "barrier" to 
further fragmentation because it would group about 58% of the party's 18 
million members in a single body and prevent domination of the whole party. 
</P>
<P>
"We need some organizational guarantees that this dominating Russian Communist 
Party does not cause the development of separatist tendencies in other 
republican parties," Medvedev said, referring to rebellions within party ranks 
in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in Armenia and 
Georgia in the south and in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
The need to preserve party unity has also apparently led the party leadership 
to drop plans for the adoption of a new party program, for conservatives and 
radicals would undoubtedly see it as a final struggle for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said there is even sentiment for pushing deliberation over other key 
policy documents into closed-door commissions to avoid inflaming passions at 
the congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Political tension in the country is rather high," he said. "The party and 
nation are in a critical stage at this time as the final work is completed for 
the party's congress." 
</P>
<P>
The party leadership, seeking a greater mandate for broader and faster reforms, 
brought forward the congress by a year -- it opens here July 2 and is expected 
to run for a week or more -- and it has portrayed the congress as a pivotal 
event in the country's history.

GAY BLACK MEN SLOW TO PRACTICE SAFE SEX, SURVEY FINDS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: ONLY 54% 'ALWAYS OR NEARLY ALWAYS' TAKE AIDS PRECAUTIONS. LOW 
SELF-ESTEEM AND THE FAILURE OF PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE BLAMED.

Black gay and bisexual men have been slow to adopt safer sex practices despite 
near-universal knowledge of how the AIDS virus is transmitted, according to the 
first nationwide survey of black men who have sex with other men. 
</P>
<P>
Although 97% of the 952 men surveyed claimed knowledge of what constitutes 
safer sex and unsafe sex, only 54% "always or nearly always" practice safer 
sex, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and conducted by 
the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention, a project of the National Assn. of 
Black and White Men Together. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an alarming gap between the knowledge of what constitutes unsafe sex 
and the ability to act on that knowledge," said Phill Wilson, health training 
coordinator for the task force. 
</P>
<P>
Among the survey's findings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only half of the men who engaged in anal intercourse, the sexual activity 
most likely to transmit the virus, said that they always or almost always use a 
condom. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One-third of the men said they have vaginal sex; of those, only 30% always 
or almost always use a condom. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Twenty percent said that they probably would engage in unsafe sex even if 
they had AIDS or were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a Los Angeles black man who is infected with HIV, said many black men 
suffer from what he called "the full-plate syndrome" -- the sense that "there 
are so many dangers and attacks on their lives that HIV has to stand in line." 
</P>
<P>
Black gays and bisexuals are not "cavalier hedonists," added Reggie Williams, 
another black man with HIV and the executive director of the task force. He 
blamed the continued prevalence of unsafe sex among blacks on "low 
self-esteem," the failure of traditional AIDS prevention programs to address 
blacks in culturally relevant language and the "sexual schizophrenia" of black 
men who are in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
Bisexual men who are in the closet pose a special risk to their female sex 
partners and their babies, Williams said, adding: "This is a threat to the 
entire black community. 
</P>
<P>
"The black community and its institutions must become more involved if we are 
to reduce the risk to women and children, as well as to black men, regardless 
of their sexual orientation," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to deal forthrightly with issues of sexuality that the black 
community has denied or ignored for far too long," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The survey's findings will be used to design AIDS risk-reduction campaigns 
specifically targeted toward black men who have sex with other men -- and to 
document the urgent need for funding such programs. 
</P>
<P>
The men who participated were interviewed in 25 medium and large urban areas by 
specially trained workers through organizations and in private homes, bars and 
other gay meeting places. 
</P>
<P>
"Critics and naysayers said it simply couldn't be done -- that this population 
was too hard to reach," said Williams, adding that the survey proved otherwise. 
The next step, he said, is to fund educational campaigns to motivate these men 
to alter their sexual behavior, saving both lives and dollars.

HUSBAND FLED AFTER 'MACHINE' SUICIDE

Ronald Adkins, husband of the Portland, Ore., woman who committed suicide with 
the assistance of a doctor near here last week, tried to leave the area quickly 
on the afternoon of his wife's death and initially tried to evade police 
questioning, state police and local prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Not until he was in the doorway of an airplane at Detroit's Metropolitan 
Airport and being questioned by a Michigan State Police detective for a second 
time did Adkins acknowledge that he was the husband of the dead woman, Janet 
Adkins, a 54-year-old Alzheimer's disease patient, officials here said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to get out of our jurisdiction as quickly as possible," said one 
prosecutor involved in the case, who asked not to be identified. "He wanted to 
disappear." 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed unusual to me that, if a man knew his wife was going to die, that he 
wouldn't stick around and at least take care of the arrangements," added Sgt. 
Terry Saunders, the detective who first questioned Adkins. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders went to the airport simply to notify Adkins that his wife had died. 
Saunders canvassed everyone waiting to board the aircraft on which Adkins was 
to be a passenger. Although Adkins was among them, he did not step forward 
until the airline gate attendant saw his ticket and pointed him out to 
Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders then asked Adkins to accompany him while he telephoned the state 
police post in suburban Pontiac, which was handling the case. Adkins refused to 
do so and boarded the plane, according to Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
His suspicions aroused, the detective then called for more information and 
learned, for the first time, that a "medically supervised" suicide had taken 
place. Saunders was asked to confirm Ronald Adkins' identity, so he then acted 
to detain the flight. Adkins came off the plane and acknowledged that he knew 
about the suicide. He told Saunders he would be willing to cooperate in any 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders had not been asked to detain Adkins, however, so the husband then left 
for Portland, leaving behind his wife's body and many of her personal effects, 
local officials said. He had left cremation instructions with a Detroit area 
funeral home, prosecutors said, but the body was held for an autopsy by the 
Oakland County, Mich., medical examiner. The body has since been released. 
</P>
<P>
State police and prosecutors said that, if not for poor communications between 
officials at the scene of Janet Adkins' death and Saunders at the airport, the 
husband probably would have been held for further questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are now awaiting an autopsy report and the completion of a state 
police report to determine whether criminal charges should be brought against 
anyone involved in the death, most notably Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the retired 
pathologist from the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, Mich., who helped Janet 
Adkins kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Adkins, an investment broker in Portland, did not return telephone calls 
to his home and office Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The June 4 death of Janet Adkins, who killed herself in the back of a rusting 
1968 Volkswagen van with the aid of a drug-dispensing "suicide machine" devised 
by Kevorkian, has caused a nationwide sensation and sparked emotional debate 
over the "right to die." 
</P>
<P>
Since his return to Portland, Adkins has publicly supported his wife's decision 
to end her life. He has appeared on television talk shows and given a wide 
range of interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Oakland County Circuit Judge Alice Gilbert issued a preliminary 
injunction barring Kevorkian from assisting any further suicides in the state. 
Kevorkian later said that he would not violate that order. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing before the ruling, Kevorkian told the court he first spoke with 
Janet Adkins the weekend before her death, when she and her husband flew to 
Michigan to meet him. Before that, he said, he had spoken only with Ronald 
Adkins. He said the husband first contacted him last October, after Janet 
Adkins had read about his "suicide machine." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Adkins contacted Kevorkian again in May, the doctor said, after some 
special treatments had failed to slow Janet Adkins' decline. Ronald Adkins told 
Kevorkian by phone that his wife was more eager than ever to end her suffering.

D.C. MAYOR BARRY WON'T SEEK REELECTION; 
</P>

DRUGS: 'NOW IS THE TIME FOR HEALING,' THE EMBATTLED POLITICIAN SAYS. HE INSISTS 
THAT HIS DECISION IS NOT A PLOY IN HIS TRIAL ON PERJURY AND NARCOTICS CHARGES.

<P>
District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, on trial in federal court on drug use 
and perjury charges, announced Wednesday night that he will not seek a fourth 
term as the district's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which had been rumored for several days, was judged by some 
observers to be timed to elicit sympathy from jurors being selected to hear 
evidence in Barry's trial or possibly to nudge prosecutors to negotiate a plea 
agreement that might allow him to avoid both the trial and a prison term. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barry insisted his decision had "no connection to the trial" and 
called those who suggested otherwise "cynics." 
</P>
<P>
Barry, in a voice choked with emotion, said in an address broadcast by a local 
television station: "Now is the time for healing; healing for me personally and 
you politically." He said he will serve until his term ends on Jan. 2, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing his faith in God, Barry said that the seven weeks he spent earlier 
this year in substance-abuse centers in Florida and South Carolina had cured 
him of chemical dependency. 
</P>
<P>
Barry entered the programs after he was indicted in an FBI sting operation in 
which he was videotaped allegedly smoking crack cocaine with a former 
girlfriend. At the time, he said that he was seeking treatment for alcoholism, 
but he has since acknowledged using drugs in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I have come back to Washington . . . a more complete person, a more humble 
person," Barry said, appearing on the verge of tears. "This decision is not 
related to my legal situation but to myself and to my wife and family." 
</P>
<P>
However, local news reports have quoted unnamed friends of Barry as saying that 
the mayor hoped jurors might be more sympathetic to his mistakes if they knew 
he would be bowing out of office at the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
Others quoted in the news reports said that Barry hoped such an announcement 
would pressure U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens to allow him to plead guilty to 
misdemeanor drug charges, rather than insisting on a guilty plea to felony 
perjury counts. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, 54, is facing 14 criminal counts: 10 misdemeanor counts of drug 
possession, one misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to possess cocaine and three 
perjury charges alleging that he lied under oath to a federal grand jury about 
his past drug use. If he is convicted on all the charges, Barry could receive a 
maximum sentence of 26 years in prison and fines of more than $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department guidelines state that, in public corruption cases, 
prosecutors are "encouraged . . . to consider voluntary offers of resignation 
from office as a desirable feature in plea agreements." 
</P>
<P>
However, Stephens has said that a resignation by Barry or a decision not to run 
again would be "irrelevant" to the charges or to any plea negotiations. Both 
sides had said that plea talks were under way just before jury selection began 
on June 4 but have been broken off. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens was said to have insisted that Barry plead guilty to at least one 
felony, but Barry had balked because he thought that would ensure a prison 
term. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said in court Wednesday that he 
hoped to finish screening prospective jurors by Friday and to impanel a jury on 
Monday. The jurors will then be sequestered in a hotel, where federal marshals 
will ensure that they not read newspapers or watch television news programs. 
</P>
<P>
By making his announcement before then, Barry guaranteed that the jurors would 
know about his plans to forgo running for a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
Until his indictment, Barry had withstood nearly a decade of corruption and 
drug investigations by two successive U.S. attorneys.

2 MOTORISTS WOUNDED BY GUNSHOTS

<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Lakewood man, the victim of an apparently random car-to-car 
shooting early Wednesday in Harbor City, was in critical condition on life 
support systems, authorities said. A 20-year-old man was shot in an earlier, 
similar, incident in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Kevin Lee Jones was driving home on Pacific Coast Highway when a 
car pulled up beside him at the traffic light on Vermont Avenue about 1 a.m. A 
flurry of shots were fired, one of which struck Jones in the head. He was taken 
to the intensive care unit at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the furthest thing from a gang member you could find," the victim's 
father, Donald Jones, said Wednesday night, conjecturing that the shooting was 
random. Kevin's maternal grandfather died recently, "so Kevin's mother is 
devastated," he said. "I'm worried about her. She's been through the wringer." 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier incident, Caesar Villanueva of Wilmington escaped serious injury 
when assailants shot at his car from behind while he was driving on Anaheim 
Street late Tuesday, police said. A bullet passed through the left side of his 
head. He was treated at a hospital and released.

LEGISLATION: ASSEMBLY PANEL APPROVES MEASURE ON SECOND VOTE. OPPONENTS SAY IT 
IS AIMED AT HEADING OFF ATTEMPTS TO RESTRICT CIGARETTE VENDING MACHINE SALES.

A key Assembly committee passed a measure Wednesday that opponents warned could 
stop California cities from further regulating the distribution of tobacco in 
public and private places. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents contended that the legislation was aimed at heading off attempts 
in Los Angeles County and elsewhere to ban or severely restrict the sale of 
cigarettes from vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the measure said it was designed only to set a statewide 
standard on the tobacco industry's distribution of free promotional samples. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fair proposal," said Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles). "It 
is unfair now in Los Angeles County, where you have 86 different cities and 86 
different ordinances and expect people to be in compliance." 
</P>
<P>
The controversial measure was approved at a hectic session of the Assembly Ways 
and Means Committee, which sent the bill to the Assembly floor as it was 
considering more than 200 measures in a rush to meet a self-imposed legislative 
deadline. The first committee vote on the bill ended with the measure on the 
losing side of a 10-2 tally. About an hour later, after lobbyists for the 
industry spoke to several committee members, the bill passed on a 12-9 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who has 
received significant campaign contributions from the tobacco industry, was 
pushing hard for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Brown could not be reached for comment, and Polanco denied that the speaker was 
involved. But Brown did appoint Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) to the 
committee as a replacement for another member just for Wednesday's meeting. 
Chacon voted for the bill, which passed without a single vote to spare. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tobacco industry relief act," said Mark A. Pertschuk, executive 
director of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights. "We have had a vital anti-tobacco 
movement at the grass-roots level. This is a slap in the face of every 
Californian who has worked on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the bill would toughen laws against marketing and distributing 
tobacco products to minors. But it also includes a provision declaring that 
only the state and not local governments can regulate certain aspects of 
tobacco distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco said this "preemption" in his bill applies only to laws governing the 
distribution of free tobacco samples. The measure would outlaw the distribution 
of free tobacco products within two blocks of places where minors are known to 
congregate. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco said, and the Legislature's chief lawyer agreed, that a law already on 
the books prevents cities from regulating cigarette vending machines. The city 
of Duarte recently passed such a measure, and Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights 
is pushing a similar proposal in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of Polanco's legislation, which was drafted by the tobacco 
industry, said current law does not already block local government from 
regulating vending machines. They said it only prevents cities and counties 
from imposing different fines than the state has imposed for the distribution 
of tobacco to minors. 
</P>
<P>
Even putting the bill in its best light, opponents said, it still would 
represent an unwarranted intrusion into the rights of local government.

HATCH WOULD MAKE NEA PAY OBSCENITY SUIT COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A key Republican senator will propose that the National Endowment for the Arts 
be required to pay the legal fees of anyone who wins an obscenity suit in a 
state court over art produced under an NEA grant. 
</P>
<P>
The plan of Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), disclosed in Washington late 
Wednesday, would amend a bill to extend the arts endowment's legislative life 
so that artists who produce obscene works could be ineligible for federal 
grants for as long as 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Hatch measure would also have the NEA publish standards to prevent federal 
sponsorship of art "which is obscene or racist or . . . denigrates a particular 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch is a member of a Senate subcommittee that, earlier Wednesday, unanimously 
voted out to the Education and Labor Committee a bill to extend the NEA for 
another five years. 
</P>
<P>
The move came hours after Rep. Paul B. Henry (R-Mich.) released the text of 
another amendment, one that would bar NEA support of art works that 
"deliberately denigrate the cultural heritage of the United States," are 
obscene or indecent or defile people on religious or racial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The actions occurred as the White House apparently abandoned President Bush's 
effort to advocate reauthorization of the arts endowment without imposing 
legislative language restricting what kinds of art the government can support. 
</P>
<P>
"There are discussions going on, not necessarily negotiations," said Alixe

MOSBACHER'S WIFE ROBBED OF CASH, JEWELRY WORTH $30,000 IN N.Y. HOTEL

Detectives searched Wednesday for a robber armed with what appeared to be a 
submachine gun who held up Georgette Mosbacher, the wife of U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, as she stepped off an elevator on the 20th floor 
of a Manhattan hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunman took Mosbacher's wedding band, watch and other jewelry 
plus $400 in cash, her passport and personal papers. A police spokesman 
estimated the total value of the jewelry seized at $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the robbery could have been a random incident. Mosbacher was 
uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said that the 43-year-old owner of a cosmetics company was 
approached by the robber just before dinner time Tuesday. The mustachioed man 
in his 20s, wearing a white jacket and carrying what appeared to be an Uzi 
submachine gun, apparently was waiting when Mosbacher got off the elevator at 
the Barbizon Hotel on Lexington Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher told detectives that she refused to obey orders from the robber, who 
wore stereo earphones, that she let him into her room. She is staying at the 
hotel while the Mosbachers' cooperative apartment on 5th Avenue is being 
renovated. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried and told him: 'The door won't open; the key won't work,' " she told 
reporters who interviewed her at the hotel after the incident. "And I told him: 
'I'm not going in there.' 
</P>
<P>
"I took off my earrings and said: 'There's a bench over there, and I'm going to 
sit.' I said to myself: 'I'm not going to live,' but I thought I'd have a 
better chance in the hallway." 
</P>
<P>
While the gunman's hands were filled with her handbag and jewelry, the elevator 
door reopened and Mosbacher dashed in. When the elevator reached the lobby, she 
ran to the front desk, hoping the hotel's staff could close off the stairway 
and trap the gunman. But he already had fled.

TO MANY, LONG COMMUTE A FAIR TRADEOFF FOR QUIETER LIFESTYLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Spear is behind the wheel of his Mercury Grand Marquis by 7:30 a.m. each 
weekday. On a good day, he's in his office soon after 9 a.m., 103 miles from 
his home in Poway. 
</P>
<P>
Spear works at the headquarters of In-N-Out Burgers, in Baldwin Park, east of 
Los Angeles. He usually heads home at 6 p.m., traversing the route -- out of 
Baldwin Park on Interstate 10 to the Corona Expressway, then onto the Pomona 
Freeway and south along Interstate 15 to Poway -- that has become second nature 
to him since he signed on last year with the company as vice president for real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
Although Interstate 5 is the preferred north-south thoroughfare for many 
commuters, Spear opts for what he calls the "back way" in and out of suburban 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
By his own calculations, he logs 5,000 miles and an oil change every four weeks 
on the company-leased Marquis. His only companionship comes from the radio, 
occasional books on tape and the business associates he connects with via his 
car phone. Still, Spear would rather fight traffic than switch from the 
relatively bucolic lifestyle Poway has afforded his family -- which includes 
11- and 13-year-old daughters -- for the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about making the move up there (to suburban Los Angeles), but there 
was no way," Spear said. "The quality of life in Poway makes the commute worth 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Dunkel made a similar choice 10 years ago when he traded an urban 
lifestyle in Mission Village for 5 acres in Julian, so his children, then 7 and 
8, might benefit from country life. 
</P>
<P>
The move came at a price: Instead of commuting five minutes to work each way 
(he was employed by Cubic Corp. at the time), Dunkel travels 55 miles to and 
from his job as production manager of the Advanced Underwater Vehicle Center of 
Honeywell Inc. in Sorrento Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He awakes at 3:50 a.m. each weekday, and he's behind the wheel of his Subaru-XT 
Coupe by 5:15 a.m. for the 80-minute trip west along California 78 and 67 to 
the Poway turnoff and the final stretch south on California 163. Dunkel's route 
bypasses the congested stretch of 78 between Escondido and Oceanside. (The 
California Department of Transportation figures that, last year, 105,000 
vehicles a day crossed the checkpoint on four-lane 78 just east of I-5, up from 
99,000 vehicles daily in 1988.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Dunkel acknowledged that commuting can be wearisome, he hasn't looked 
back since his family moved to Julian a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy my weekends in the country," he said. "The downside is that it's dark 
when I leave in the morning and often dark when I get home at night. That makes 
for a long day." 
</P>
<P>
Data on traffic trends throughout San Diego County substantiates what Spear and 
Dunkel know all too well: Forget the notion of that long, lonesome highway; 
when it comes to lengthy commutes from North County, they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of people are dividing their work and home lives between 
Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
Studies by the San Diego Assn. of Governments indicate that traffic congestion 
has been compounded throughout the county because of the region's growing labor 
force and an increase in licensed drivers. The average length of time spent 
commuting has increased, as has the distance covered. 
</P>
<P>
Renata Riedner, relocation director with Century 21 Consultants, said North 
County has become an attractive home base for people who work in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"The general consensus of North County realtors is that people are getting 
tired of fighting the traffic and the high price of housing in Orange County," 
Riedner said. "If they can find more affordable housing here, many of them are 
willing to lengthen their commute." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Zdon, a senior planner for Sandag, shares that view. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a growing commuter population in North County, particularly in terms 
of people who commute to work in the Santa Ana and Anaheim area," Zdon said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag figures that about 95,000 vehicles cross the counties' border each day. 
It estimates that the miles traveled on San Diego's freeway system increased at 
least 50% since 1980 and predicts that the trend will continue for two decades. 
Not everyone on the road is a commuter, but the many single-occupant cars 
suggest that many are. 
</P>
<P>
Although the greatest number of commuters travel by car, other modes of 
transportation are also used. Amtrak logs about 5,000 passenger trips daily 
between San Diego and Los Angeles. Air travel accounts for another 5,000 trips 
a day between the two cities, according to Sandag. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ruhrup decided to divide in order to conquer his 80-mile commute between 
his Rancho Bernardo home and his office in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhrup, general counsel for Continental Lawyers Title Co., leaves home at 6:25 
each weekday morning and drives 27 miles to the Amtrak stop in Oceanside, where 
he parks for free and catches the 7:11 a.m. northbound train. It's a short walk 
from the Amtrak stop in Santa Ana to his office, and most days Ruhrup is 
settled in at work by 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
Most evenings, provided Amtrak is running close to schedule, he boards the 5:38 
p.m. train in Santa Ana -- and is home in Rancho Bernardo soon after 7. Ruhrup 
pays $71.25 a week for his 10-ride pass. 
</P>
<P>
He says he hasn't shaved any time off the two hours it takes to make the trip 
by car, but he prefers the train commute. 
</P>
<P>
"You can relax instead of always having to watch what cars are doing in front 
and behind you," Ruhrup said. "On the way up I can get a jump on planning my 
day, and the trip back gives me a chance to unwind."

<P>
A NEW AGE GLOSSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no Webster's for the New Age, so there are different meanings for 
these words, depending on whom you ask. This glossary reflects some of the New 
Age offerings available locally. 
</P>
<P>
Aromatherapy: The use of various mixtures of oils in a massage to heal and 
balance energy. 
</P>
<P>
Aura: That electric field around all living things. It's got to be healthy for 
your emotions to be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Channeling: The act of transmitting conversation from a spirit who is always 
smarter than you are. Some channels channel only one spirit, others channel 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
Consciousness: A thing to be raised. Those with raised consciousnesses believe 
in the New Age. 
</P>
<P>
Crystals: Minerals that can do all sorts of good things. Usually energy flows 
into the base and out the point. Some New Agers think crystals are actually 
left over from Atlantis, where they were imprinted with codes containing 
knowledge, sort of a cosmic CD. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphin awareness: An attempt to learn about the universe from the dolphins, 
believed to be privy to many kinds of wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
Eckankar: The road for soul travelers. You may be helped along the road by 
ancient guides, who usually seem to be Chinese. Wah Z is especially good at 
guiding. 
</P>
<P>
Ecstasy breathing: Some would call this hyperventilation. The idea is to 
achieve a new spiritual plane through a variety of breathing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Free radicals: A scientific term denoting an atom that has an unpaired 
electron. In New Age thinking, these must be driven from the body. 
</P>
<P>
Iridology: The science of "reading" the irises of the eye to diagnose all sorts 
of maladies and emotional states. 
</P>
<P>
New Age: This moment in cosmic history. This phrase means a little something 
different to everyone and can denote a range of activities. Some have argued 
the New Age began, or ended, with the Harmonic Convergence, a rare alignment of 
stellar bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Ness: A useful suffix. You can invent your own New Age words by adding "ness" 
at the end of nouns, as in "doorness." 
</P>
<P>
Numerology: Tells about you according to various numbers in your life, such as 
your birth date. Numerologists can also tell, for example, which house numbers 
will be unlucky for you. 
</P>
<P>
Psychic: A person with several possible powers -- such as mind reading, fortune 
telling or seeing auras. 
</P>
<P>
Pyramid: A shape believed to focus huge amounts of cosmic energy. Some people 
have taken to crystals instead, because they are so much easier to carry 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Rebirthing: Usually a breathing technique designed to put you in another state 
of being so you can remember your own birth or a birth from one of your past 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Reflexology: The art of manipulating the foot to relieve stress. 
</P>
<P>
Reichain: A type of therapy using massage and touch. 
</P>
<P>
Reiki: Another type of therapy using massage and touch. 
</P>
<P>
Rolfing: A type of massage that is especially vigorous and is designed to 
pummel your troubles away. 
</P>
<P>
Shamaness: A woman who has studied spiritual arts, usually under the direction 
of native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Sufi dancing: Sufi was a Muslim mystical Shiite movement in the 11th Century 
that tried to unite man's soul with God's. Today it's a dance that tries to do 
something similar.

COMMUNITY PROFILE / FALLBROOK: FALLING FOR FALLBROOK; 
</P>
<P>
TANTALIZING SPELL STILL SNAGS MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAUGHNESSY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the Sleeping Indian Mountain formation looms over Fallbrook's 
southwest skyline, the Indians encountered by the Spanish missionaries at San 
Luis Rey and Pala during the late 1700s would not venture into what is now the 
site of Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
According to the legend of the Luisenos tribe, which populated the foothills 
and coastal plains at the time of the Spanish occupation, one of their members 
had entered the area and had been bewitched and turned to stone. 
</P>
<P>
Centuries later, Fallbrook continues to cast its tantalizing spell over those 
who enter its environs. Part of the enchantment is that travelers do not drive 
through Fallbrook on their way to anywhere else -- to visit the town you must 
decide that this is your destination. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, when folks arrive, they decide this country village -- billed as 
the world avocado capital -- is where they want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from an old country town in Massachusetts, and Fallbrook reminded me of 
it," said Bettina Shaw, who moved to the area from Los Angeles in 1969. "We 
loved the avocado trees and all the fresh air. The town was so pretty, we 
decided to retire here." 
</P>
<P>
A former documentary filmmaker, lecturer and self-described "fugitive from a 
film colony in Hollywood," Shaw was charmed by the downtown, where some 
original Western-style buildings, as well as some "false front" designs, give 
the appearance of a frontier town. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't even any traffic lights when I first came here," said Shaw, who 
now owns an antique and doll shop. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook has long been the favorite of Hollywood types (the Frank Capra home 
was on 18 acres of Red Mountain Ranch and two sons graduated from Fallbrook 
High School) as well as the corporate elite, and an enduring group of active 
and retired commercial pilots who use Fallbrook as their home base. The pilots 
can take off and land in their private planes at Fallbrook Air Park. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the area's residents live on 5-to-15-acre parcels of avocado and citrus 
groves. 
</P>
<P>
Rufus and Betty Thompson gradually came to make their home in Fallbrook, and 
today live with 8 acres of peach, persimmon and avocado trees. 
</P>
<P>
Rufus Thompson discovered Fallbrook when he was stationed at Camp Pendleton 
during the '60s. After retiring from the Marine Corps, he and his family moved 
north to El Segundo but acquired a pied-a-terre in Fallbrook for peaceful, 
getaway weekends. Ten years ago, they returned to live full time. 
</P>
<P>
"The trees keep me plenty busy," said the retired Marine. "I wanted to find 
something to keep me active that I could also get away from when I wanted. It's 
really a very enjoyable way of life." 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook is a roller-coaster of a town, with sinuous roads running up hill and 
down dale. Most of the homes are not visible from the road -- long, gated 
driveways and dirt roads disappear into thick, green foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Ancient oaks and huge sycamores shade the area, and rambling streams and narrow 
winding valleys carry the rainfall runoff to the Santa Margarita and San Luis 
Rey rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Fallbrook's rural charm can be attributed to its insulated location. 
It's bounded on the north by the Santa Margarita River and the Riverside County 
line, and on the west by the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station and Camp 
Pendleton. Interstate 15 serves as the eastern border, and the town extends 
south to the San Luis Rey River and California 76. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook, with an estimated population of 34,000 if you include neighboring 
Bonsall and Rainbow, has not escaped the growth affecting all of North County. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many other communities, Fallbrook is struggling to balance the 
interests of preservation and development. A number of residents have become 
activists in trying to preserve the rural ambience. Recently, a group came 
together to form the Fallbrook Land Conservancy, which succeeded in 
establishing a 43-acre nature preserve on the edge of town. When a stand of 
live oaks was cut down recently to make way for a housing development, it 
prompted cries of outrage. 
</P>
<P>
"Fallbrook has changed a lot in the last 15 years. Everybody found it," said 
Dorothy Norton, who came in 1948 from Santa Ana when her father took a job with 
the Soil Conservation Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the population about doubled in the last 10 years, and a lot of 
groves are being cut down for subdivisions and houses. But we have a very 
active planning group, and we're trying to keep it rural." 
</P>
<P>
Even before it was settled in 1869, the area now known as Fallbrook was unique. 
When the Francisco padres and Spanish conquistadors settled in Southern 
California, they took over the land in San Luis Rey and Pala, but not in the 
Live Oak Park area. 
</P>
<P>
Vital Reche, his wife, and three children settled in the area in 1869. Having 
traveled west from their home in Fall Brook, Pa., they first lived in the Santa 
Clara Valley, and for a short time, Pala, before homesteading by Live Oak 
Creek. They designated the area Fall Brook, after their Pennsylvania home (the 
name later become one word), and began farming and raising bees on the 160-acre 
Reche Ranch, which eventually housed a resort hotel, post office, stagecoach 
stop and grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
Although the land was fertile enough to support strawberry and alfalfa crops 
grown by the Reches and other farmers, the creek was an erratic water source, 
overflowing from cloudbursts and repeatedly washing out dams and crops. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Harris, who owns two antique shops in town, said he had no intention of 
moving to Fallbrook when he first went there. "It was almost like a fluke. I 
was furnishing a house and came out here to look for antiques. I found a house 
I loved that was about to be torn down, so I bought it.

PEERING INTO THE GLORY HOLE; 
</P>
<P>
WITH RIGHT TOUCH, MAGICAL METAMORPHOSIS TRANSPIRES

<P>
The heat's the thing. Gas-fed flames rage at 2,000 degrees inside cylindrical 
ovens known as "glory holes." These are used to heat glass for shaping and 
blowing. Glass blowers hover close to the heat in a sort of fire ritual, 
wielding their "blow pipes" gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
The moves are slow and deliberate, like the Oriental martial art known as t'ai 
chi ch'uan. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Reed sits on a bench watching two students work, their foreheads beaded 
with perspiration. Through portholes in two glory holes, you can see flames 
swirling. Even 15 feet away, the heat is intense. 
</P>
<P>
Reed heads the glass-blowing program at Palomar College in San Marcos, the only 
such program in San Diego County. The department is so well thought of that 
artists often come down Los Angeles for the summer session. 
</P>
<P>
Reed worships this art. As he uses a chisel to break colored rods of glass into 
hunks for melting, the metamorphosis begins. Until this point, he has moved 
slowly, talking casually, hiding from the bright fire behind dark glasses. 
</P>
<P>
As he becomes engrossed in the work, his movements quicken. He moves on the 
balls of his feet, thrusting the blowpipe into a glory hole for several 
seconds. He pulls the end of the pipe out of the hole and begins shaping the 
softened glass at its tip by rolling it on a flat steel table, a technique 
known as "marvering." Occasionally, he adds more glass by dipping the tip of 
the pipe into a pool of molten glass at the bottom of a special oven, a step 
known as "gathering." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the process, he rotates the pipe in his hands to keep the hot glass 
from sagging. 
</P>
<P>
Blowing gently into the pipe, Reed watches a vase bloom at the other end. He 
thrusts into the glory hole, marvers, blows, gathers, thrusts, shapes the hot 
glass against a folded newspaper in the palm of his hand, repeating the motions 
in different combinations over and over. 
</P>
<P>
Reed started out as a ceramic artist, earning his fine arts masters from 
Humboldt State University. When he took a glass-blowing class at Palomar 
College in 1976, he was hooked. By 1979, when the glass program's founder, Val 
Sanders, stepped down, Reed was the resident expert, so they put him in charge. 
</P>
<P>
He is not the only one to become suddenly entranced with the fragile art. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Licone, one of Reed's students, played bass in a rock band -- until he 
tried glass blowing. Now he spends most of his time dancing gracefully with a 
long metal tube. 
</P>
<P>
Rina Fehrensen studied art at UCSD, but when she experienced the primal energy 
of glass blowing, she too became a "vulture," spending much of her free time 
waiting to swoop in on an available glory hole. 
</P>
<P>
Licone is attempting to duplicate a difficult glass pitcher he made a few days 
ago. Sitting on two front "legs" and a "tail," it looks like some odd sea 
creature; Licone calls it "nuclear scampi." 
</P>
<P>
After several thrusts of the pipe into the glory hole, a number of gentle 
breaths to expand the evolving creation, and a variety of shaping techniques, 
the replica is coming to life. 
</P>
<P>
Then Licone makes a crucial error. He lets the vase get too cool. 
</P>
<P>
When he puts it back into the glory hole, the change of temperature is too 
drastic, and the glass explodes. He has worked for an hour or so, but seems 
unperturbed. Almost immediately, he starts over. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said glass blowing taught him control in his life. "I used to be angry all 
the time. I thought my fists were immune to solid objects." 
</P>
<P>
Now Reed takes a turn at the glory hole. In 30 minutes or so, he has grown a 
foot-long cylindrical vase at the end of his pipe. He "punti's off" -- attaches 
a steel rod to the bottom of the vase with a hot piece of glass and cuts the 
blow pipe loose. Using the rod as a handle, he finishes the top of the vase, 
where the pipe was attached. 
</P>
<P>
After some shaping, the piece is complete, a perfect form with a swirling, 
marbly array of fine colors embedded in the glass. 
</P>

Reed places it with several other pieces in a 1000-degree "annealing oven." 
Overnight, the temperature of the oven will drop gradually so the pieces inside 
will cool without shattering. 
</P>
<P>
All of this heat and drama does not come cheaply. The gas bill for a one-man 
studio can easily top $1,000. Blow pipes are $50 and up. The $220 fee that 
advanced students pay each semester helps cover the cost of glass; more than 
1,500 pounds are used by the department each week. 
</P>
<P>
But Reed prefers to describe glass blowing in more reverent terms. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls the words of a friend who seemed to capture some of the spirit: 
"We'd come in here in the morning, and it would be mystical, with the coastal 
overcast. He said that our pipes were swords, and he was fending off the 
dragon. This is about as close as you can get to the fire and the material."

RILEY, BUSS WORK ON NEW DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: THE FORMER COACH IS NEGOTIATING FOR A FRONT-OFFICE POSITION. HE 
ALSO IS CLOSE TO A NBC CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Riley's future, the main issue left unresolved after Monday's news 
conference announcing his resignation as Laker coach, is likely to be decided 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
Riley is close to reaching an agreement with NBC to be a commentator for the 
network's NBA coverage next season, and sources say an announcement is expected 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
But it was also learned Wednesday that Riley is not expected to completely 
sever ties with the Lakers, whom he coached for nine seasons. He is negotiating 
a new contract with owner Jerry Buss for a front-office job that could begin 
immediately or wait until after Riley's broadcast commitments are over. 
</P>
<P>
Buss said Wednesday that, contrary to published reports Tuesday in the Long 
Beach Press-Telegram, he is not negotiating a "settlement" of Riley's coaching 
contract, which had two seasons to run. Instead, Buss said a new contract for a 
different job is being negotiated, even though a job title for Riley has not 
been determined. 
</P>
<P>
"We have torn up the old contract and offered him a new one," Buss said. "What 
position he would have depends on how free he is." 
</P>
<P>
Riley and Buss denied the Press-Telegram story that quoted unnamed sources as 
saying that Riley actually was fired, rather than resigning, and that Buss has 
settled Riley's contract for $6 million over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was totally Pat's," Buss said Wednesday. "I don't know where that 
came from. It sure didn't come from me." 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley: "It's wrong. It's not true. (Buss) is not just trying to protect 
me. Every indication he gave me is that he wanted me to stay. What he said at 
the press conference about wanting me to stay as coach is exactly what he told 
me all along. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Buss has always been supportive of me and appreciative of what the 
coaching staff has contributed to the Lakers' success. If Jerry Buss -- or 
Jerry West, too -- ever looked me in the eye and told me I was hurting the 
team, I would've left and said so. That's not what happened." 
</P>
<P>
West, the Lakers' general manager, also denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry Buss did not fire Pat Riley, period, period, period," West said. "To 
suggest otherwise is ludicrous . . . The thing is, this guy just did not want 
to coach anymore. Jerry and (Riley) have a good relationship. That's what makes 
this so ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Riley had two seasons remaining on a contract of $650,000 a season, plus 
incentives. Because he resigned, Riley would forfeit the final two years of his 
coaching contract. Any new position with the Lakers or Buss would be done under 
a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
"If he is free to do so, he could start with the Lakers immediately," Buss 
said. "Our offer is on the table. He can take it now or down the road. He has 
other deals to negotiate first. I can't comment on those. I only know what we 
have offered him." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid perceptions of a conflict of interest, Riley might be asked by the 
network to wait to work for Buss until after leaving NBC, should he choose to 
accept the network's offer. Brian McIntyre, NBA vice president for public 
relations, said the league has no authority over the announcers used on network 
telecasts. He said the league would not intervene if a broadcaster were also 
employed by an NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Buss nor Riley gave details of the new Laker offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Buss has offered me a deal for the future," Riley said Wednesday. "It has 
nothing to do with any settlement. It's just a long-term thing if I choose to 
stay with the Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
Riley would not comment on the reports that he already has reached an agreement 
with NBC and is merely waiting for the NBA finals to end to announce it. The 
NBC job, a source said, would pay about the same as his coaching salary, 
$650,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Riley also has offers from Prime Ticket, HBO and Columbia Pictures for various 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
John Severino, the president of Prime Ticket, said: "If his NBC contract will 
allow it, we would like to use him in a variety of ways -- on our news show 
(scheduled to begin Oct. 1) and also at halftime or following Laker telecasts." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything should be cleared up in two or three weeks," Buss said. "Pat has a 
lot of decisions still to make." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
New Coach Mike Dunleavy has met with Bill Bertka, Randy Pfund and Jim Eyan, as 
well as General Manager Jerry West, and soon will decide on his coaching staff. 
It is possible that one or all of Pat Riley's former assistants will be 
retained. But sources said Dunleavy also is considering hiring Jan van Breda 
Kolff, an assistant coach at Providence College and son of former Laker coach 
Butch van Breda Kolff.

LOS ALAMITOS TAKES A PAGE FROM PAST WITH THE AMERICAN PACING CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SCHUELEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Pacing Classic, which put California harness racing on the map 
until the event was discontinued in 1981, will resume at Los Alamitos with a 
$150,000 finish on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's finalized," Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of the 
track, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have the best horses in the United States for the Classic. We're coming 
of age this fall." 
</P>
<P>
The American Pacing and Trotting classics were held annually at Hollywood Park 
from 1955 through 1981 and attracted most of the top names in the sport. The 
American Pacing Classic was won by such stars as Adios Butler, Meadow Skipper, 
Cardigan Bay, Overcall, Albatross, Rambling Willie and Niatross. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll bring the Trotting Classic back next year," said Arnold, part of a group 
that bought Los Alamitos for $71 million last year from Hollywood Park 
Operating Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had fabulous feedback. Everyone says, 'Whatever I've got, I'm sending, 
if he's good enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Pacing Classic will include $35,000 legs on Sept. 8, 15 and 22. The nine 
highest money-earners will qualify for the final. Nominations close July 15 
with a $500 payment for the free-for-all pace. Races will be at one mile, with 
a $75,000 first prize for the final. 
</P>
<P>
The Classic will be the most important harness race in California since the 
1986 Breeders' Crown Horse and Gelding Pace was raced at Los Alamitos. The 
$301,350 event was won by Forrest Skipper, who culminated an unbeaten season 
and clinched horse-of-the-year honors.

CALIFORNIA TRACKS WILL TAKE LAS VEGAS OUT OF BOOKMAKING BUSINESS, IF PRICE IS 
RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a never-ending quest to maximize its gambling product, the California 
pari-mutuel racing industry has turned its eyes on the biggest prize of all -- 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The state's race tracks already sell their race television signals to dozens of 
Nevada racebooks. Southern California's biggest tracks -- Santa Anita, 
Hollywood Park and Del Mar -- end up with about $15,000 a day in commissions 
based on approximately $550,000 in racebook handle. The figures for Northern 
California thoroughbred tracks are about half those amounts. 
</P>
<P>
However, track officials say that such sums could be penny-ante compared to the 
possibilities of a direct link between the betting pools of the California 
inter-track system and the Nevada racebooks and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only a guesstimate," said Don Robbins, Hollywood Park executive vice 
president and general manager, "but with the limits off bets and odds, I'd say 
the handle at the books might increase by 20% to 40%." 
</P>
<P>
Presently, the racebooks set their own ceilings on both bets and payoffs, 
whereas bettors at the track or at satellite facilities in California can bet 
as much as they want and receive the full payoffs, no matter how big they are. 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, the payoffs come out of the racebook's pockets, so they currently 
must try to hold down potential losses by setting limits on how much can be bet 
and on what odds they will pay. Robbins pointed out the obvious advantage for a 
racebook to be part of a larger pari-mutuel pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you go into the pari-mutuel system, it becomes a matter of complete 
indifference which horse wins," Robbins said. "All they care about is the same 
thing we care about -- how much money is wagered." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins added, however, that the racebooks must be willing to pay for the 
privilege of joining the California pools. The Nevada Gaming Control Board 
recently adopted a regulation placing a 3% limit on what racebooks can pay the 
supplier of a signal. The race track operators, who must pay state taxes and 
split their share with horsemen, say the figure is far too low. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in discussions for the last three or four months," Robbins said. 
"But when it became apparent that the 3% limit was going to be adopted, we sort 
of lost our enthusiasm for pushing it along. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're receiving between 2 1/2% and 2 3/4%," Robbins went on. "And 
they've given us this crumb. I think it should be worth a substantial amount to 
them to be out of the bookmaking business." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Cliff Goodrich, Santa Anita's president and chief operating 
officer, concurs. 
</P>
<P>
"The key now is the rate they are willing to pay us," Goodrich said. "As 
racebooks, their gross hold averages about 14% after payouts. Looking at the 
takeout in California, we know they are going to hold between 18% and 18 1/2% 
by going pari-mutuel. So, we have taken the risk away from them, they are 
holding 4% to 4 1/2% more money, and giving us a quarter to a half of a percent 
more. To Santa Anita, that doesn't seem too fair." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Harper, executive vice president and general manager of Del Mar, made it 
unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
"Until that 3% changes, there is no incentive," Harper said. "We'll just keep 
doing business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the casinos and racebooks have divided along big fish-little 
fish lines. The big fish -- casinos such as Caesars Palace, Bally's and the 
Hilton -- formed the Nevada Pari-Mutuel Commission to handle their interests in 
the negotiations. The organization represents 14 racebooks that handle more 
than 90% of the action on California races, according to Dennis Amerine, 
commission president. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the smaller racebooks are very much concerned that it will cost them 
more to operate under this scenario (as part of the pari-mutuel system), rather 
than just being bookmakers," Amerine said. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller racebooks are balking at the communications costs involved with a 
pari-mutuel hookup -- a minimum of $58,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Nevada group can cut separate deals with the various 
California tracks, which in turn must be careful to avoid the appearance of 
collusion. Amerine hopes to have at least one track, probably Bay Meadows, 
signed up for a test run sometime before the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
The pari-mutuel link with Nevada became possible when legislation was passed 
last year permitting California tracks to mingle their pools with "sister" 
tracks located outside the state. Santa Anita, which had an ownership interest 
in Canterbury Downs near Minneapolis, began sending its simulcast signal to 
Minnesota right away. Ladbroke Racing's Golden Gate Fields did the same with 
Wyoming Downs, also owned by Ladbroke. 
</P>
<P>
The law has been interpreted to enable the Nevada pari-mutuel link as well.

Auto Sales Weaken: Sales of North American-made cars and trucks slipped 13.1% 
in early June, mainly because there were fewer incentive packages in the period 
than in the same period last year, auto makers reported. The weaker sales were 
off from a rate that wasn't particularly strong during June 1-10 last year, 
even though generous incentive packages initiated two months previously had 
been extended. 
</P>
<P>
This year, incentives covered fewer cars and trucks, and rebates were lower. 
The auto makers reported that they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 
30,412 units during the early-June period this year, compared to a rate of 
34,994 during the same period last year. Car sales fell 15.5%, and truck sales 
were off 8.8%.

MULHEREN DENIES ILLEGAL DEALINGS WITH BOESKY; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: THE GREGARIOUS FORMER STOCK SPECULATOR TESTIFIES THAT HE NEVER 
'PARKED' STOCK AND HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF INSIDE TRADING.

<P>
Stock speculator John A. Mulheren Jr. took the witness stand in his own defense 
Wednesday and squarely denied that he had ever made illegal stock trades in the 
mid-1980s with admitted inside trader Ivan F. Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren also said he didn't know that Boesky was receiving and trading on 
inside information during the time the two men had a business relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by his own lawyer, Thomas Puccio, Mulheren said he had never 
agreed to hold stock illicitly for Boesky and said he never accepted an 
arrangement under which Boesky would have protected him from losses. Mulheren 
is on trial in federal court on 41 felony counts of illegally "parking" stock, 
stock market manipulation and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about one transaction, in which he is accused of secretly holding the 
stock of Storer Communications for Boesky, the defendant said he had 
specifically turned down an offer by Boesky's chief trader, Michael Davidoff, 
to protect him from any losses while holding the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren, 40, said he told Davidoff in a telephone conversation: "I told you 
before that I don't do those kinds of transactions. I'm a big boy and I take 
the risk myself." 
</P>
<P>
Boesky and Davidoff both testified earlier in the trial as prosecution 
witnesses. They claimed that they had such agreements with Mulheren. 
</P>
<P>
The defense's decision to put Mulheren on the stand came as a surprise to 
people closely following the trial. Defendants aren't required to testify. 
Lawyers observing the case had said they thought testimony by Mulheren was 
unlikely, in part because of his history of mental illness. He is a diagnosed 
manic-depressive who was once arrested on charges of leaving his home with a 
loaded assault rifle, allegedly intending to shoot Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
But Puccio claimed during a break in the trial Wednesday that "we always 
planned to put him on" the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren gave a colorful description of how he was first introduced to Boesky 
in 1975. He said he met Boesky at a dinner arranged by a mutual Wall Street 
acquaintance in a fashionable restaurant on Manhattan's Upper West Side. He 
said Boesky looked at the menu and then ordered "six to eight" entrees for 
himself. "He ordered most of the entrees on the menu, then picked what he 
wanted to eat after he ordered," Mulheren said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the weeks of testimony so far, the tall, beefy Mulheren has been a 
gregarious presence at the defense table, talking freely and joking with 
reporters, family members and friends during recesses in the trial. And on the 
day he took the stand for the first time, he stuck to his regimen of dressing 
informally. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren wore a striped button-down shirt with an open collar, dark slacks and 
boat shoes. He wore no socks. He answered questions in a loud, firm voice, in 
the manner of someone who had been chomping at the bit for weeks to tell his 
side of the story. But at times he seemed nervous and glanced frequently at his 
tangerine-colored wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
In the short time that he was on the stand before the trial adjourned for the 
day, Mulheren testified mainly about the "parking" charges against him. Parking 
involves sham trades of securities in which someone pretends to buy stock with 
a secret agreement to sell it back later without risk of loss. Mulheren is 
accused of illegally parking stock for Boesky to help him evade taxes and 
regulations governing securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren admitted that he had done Boesky "a favor" by agreeing to buy 330,000 
shares of Unocal stock in 1985. But he denied that it was to help Boesky avoid 
disclosure requirements and said he never agreed to an arrangement in which 
Boesky would reimburse him for the losses he eventually suffered when the stock 
ultimately was sold. The government charges that Mulheren had secretly agreed 
to sell the stock back to Boesky, but Boesky allegedly told him to sell it on 
the open market instead after it declined in price. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren is due to resume his testimony today. After Puccio finishes, Mulheren 
faces a potentially grueling cross-examination by prosecutors. Lawyers said 
they expect testimony in the trial to end next week. Character witnesses for 
Mulheren so far have included Samuel Belzberg, a member of the family noted for 
corporate raiding in the 1980s, and Alan C. "Ace" Greenberg, chairman and chief 
executive of the brokerage firm Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
A former trader at Mulheren's firm, Leonard L. DeStefano, is also a defendant 
in the case.

CHRYSLER MAY BUY DOLLAR RENT A CAR;

AUTOMOBILES: A DEAL WOULD GIVE THE NO. 3 CAR MAKER A CAPTIVE CUSTOMER FOR ITS

Chrysler Corp. and Los Angeles-based Dollar Rent A Car are discussing the sale 
of Dollar, the nation's largest privately owned auto rental company, to 
Chrysler, a well placed source said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that discussions are at a fairly advanced stage," said auto analyst 
Charles H. Finnie of Alex. Brown &amp; Co., a Baltimore investment company. 
Another source said, "It's just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
A source who declined to be identified said Dollar would be worth somewhere 
between $70 million and $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
If the transaction is consummated, it would follow a trend of transforming the 
auto rental industry into a distribution system for the nation's auto makers, 
giving them captive customers for their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The auto rental firms are coveted by the auto makers because they are the 
largest buyers of cars," Finnie said. Such deals give the auto makers a place 
to sell cars even when individual sales decline, he added. Dollar, which 
purchases between 70,000 and 80,000 cars annually, has been using mostly 
General Motors cars. 
</P>
<P>
Ford owns a portion of Hertz Corp., the nation's largest car rental company, 
and has also invested in Budget Rent A Car. General Motors has invested in 
National Car Rental System and Avis. And Chrysler already owns Thrifty 
Rent-A-Car Inc., which it bought last July for $263 million. Five days later, 
Thrifty bought Snappy Car Rental for $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar, which has 762 locations in the United States and 550 outside the 
country, is largely a franchising company and owns only about 10% of its 
locations. It has a fleet of 82,000 vehicles, with 57,000 in the United States 
and the rest overseas. 
</P>
<P>
According to Automotive Fleet magazine, Dollar is the sixth-largest U.S. rental 
car company in terms of total revenue, including that taken in by franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Rent A Car was founded in 1966 by Henry J. Caruso as Dollar A Day with a 
fleet of 18 Volkswagens operating from one location in downtown Los Angeles. 
Within a year, Caruso had opened another five branches in Los Angeles, and the 
company's first airport site was at the Burbank Airport. The company then began 
selling franchises nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Caruso, who is in his 60s, "has reached the point in his 
life where he wants to quit working," Finnie said.

Chinese Army Buys AT&amp;T Equipment: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is 
selling $5 million worth of high-technology phone equipment to the Chinese army 
and has launched a joint venture to make equipment in the Communist nation, the 
company said. The contract -- for digital telephone exchanges -- with the 
People's Liberation Army was signed last month and is awaiting U.S. government 
approval, said AT&amp;T spokesman Tom Harris. Harris also said AT&amp;T was 
granted a license by the Chinese government about two months ago to start a 
joint-venture to make telecommunication transmission equipment.

AMERICANS ARE SCARED SAVERS, SURVEY SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMERS: BABY BOOMERS ARE GETTING MUCH THRIFTIER. MANY FEAR HAVING TO PAY FOR 
A PARENT'S CARE AND A CHILD'S EDUCATION AT THE SAME TIME.

Americans -- particularly aging baby boomers -- are increasingly pessimistic 
about their financial prospects and, consequently, are beginning to save more 
than ever before, according to a survey by the International Assn. for 
Financial Planning in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"Pessimism is causing everybody to put away more money," said Robert A. Hewitt, 
chairman of the financial planners' trade group. "We, as a nation, are coming 
to grips with the fact that we can't spend more than we make." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. savings rate proves that the respondents aren't just talking, Hewitt 
added. Savings as a percentage of disposable personal income has risen from 
3.2% in 1987 to 5.4% in the first quarter of 1990, according to the Commerce 
Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of factors have weighed in to worry the vast majority of the 1,758 
individuals surveyed about their ability to cope with future financial 
responsibilities, according to the IAFP. 
</P>
<P>
Older baby boomers, those between the ages of 35 and 44, believe that they are 
in a "triple squeeze" -- likely to have to pay for a child's education, support 
an aging parent and save for their own retirement at the same time. An 
astounding 75% of this group say they are currently saving or planning to save 
more in 1990 because of these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
On average, 62% of the general population responded they were planning to save 
more this year than last. 
</P>
<P>
But Americans are also worried about mundane, day-to-day expenses, such as 
making car and mortgage payments, paying taxes and buying insurance. The cost 
of child care has also emerged as a concern, with 4% of the population citing 
it as a worry, compared to less than 0.5% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Only 8% of those surveyed in 1990 said they had no real financial worries, 
compared to 6% in 1989 and 15% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Gallup Organization conducted the survey with a random telephone sample of 
1,058 households. It also called 600 additional families with incomes above 
$50,000 to determine the concerns of affluent Americans. The margin of error 
was given as plus or minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest long-term worry for both the general population and aging baby 
boomers -- the most concerned and pessimistic group surveyed -- is the 
possibility of having to cope with two major expenses, namely a parent's care 
and a child's education at the same time. Two-thirds of the baby boomers and 
53% of the general population cited this as one of their topmost concerns. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the respondents were also worried about outliving their 
retirement savings -- 52% of the total population, compared to 62% of the baby 
boomers. Moreover, 46% of the general population and 59% of the baby boomers 
said they were "very or somewhat concerned about meeting all their financial 
responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Other survey results: 
</P>
<P>
* 86% of those surveyed believe that college costs have risen beyond the means 
of most American families. 
</P>
<P>
* 86% believe that severe inflation is likely to be a problem in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
* 83% said the cost of day care has become a serious financial burden for most 
families with small children. 
</P>
<P>
* 66% believe that there is less chance for retirees to be financially 
self-sufficient in the 1990s than in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Women are more pessimistic than men, with 91% of the women surveyed saying 
college will probably cost too much for most American families in the 1990s. 
Only 81% of the men agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAVING MORE 
</P>
<P>
Gallup surveyed 1,058 households nationwide. An additional 600 households with 
incomes of $50,000 or more were surveyed to determine results for the "wealthy" 
category. Here is how they responded to the question, "What are your top two or 
three long-term financial goals?"

NYSE TO BEGIN OFF-HOURS TRADING SOON, REPORT SAYS

The New York Stock Exchange will begin trading stocks outside of its normal 
hours and off its trading floor later this year, a first in its nearly 200-year 
history, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The plans are an attempt to recapture trading volume in NYSE-listed stocks from 
foreign markets, especially London and Tokyo, as the world moves toward 
around-the-clock stock trading, the New York Times said in an early edition of 
today's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The new trading will be conducted electronically and may bypass the 
specialists, the floor traders through whom stock transactions are routed 
currently, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited unidentified people in the industry who have been briefed 
by stock exchange officials. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Torrenzano, an exchange spokesman reached late Wednesday, said the Big 
Board has been studying the possibility of off-hours trading for two years, 
"and we've begun to discuss some very innovative ways to approach that idea. 
</P>
<P>
"If we see a need by our customers to have an off-hour trading system, we will 
move very innovatively and quickly to meet that customer demand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times said the exchange plans to begin two limited after-hours trading 
sessions later this year, with different rules applying than during daytime 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime in 1991, the exchange plans to conduct auctions of each Big Board 
stock at 8 p.m., midnight and 5 a.m. New York time, the newspaper said. Each 
stock would trade only once at each auction, with all trades combined at a 
single agreed price. 
</P>
<P>
The three auction times would coincide with the start of the Tokyo business 
day, the middle of the Tokyo day and the early part of the London business day. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 15 million to 20 million shares of NYSE stocks trade each 
day outside of exchange hours. Average volume during the exchange's 9:30 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. session has been running at about 160 million shares recently.

GREAT WESTERN DISCLOSES SEC INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an "informal inquiry" 
related to Great Western Financial Corp.'s disclosures last year of real estate 
loan problems that caused a $77.3-million loss for the Beverly Hills-based 
thrift in last year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In an SEC filing, the parent of Great Western Bank said that it was notified of 
the probe on Friday and that the agency will be requesting documents related to 
its 1989 financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western said the inquiry involves the timing of its disclosures as well 
as "internal controls" related to the devaluing of assets and setting aside of 
about $200 million to deal with the problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western, the nation's second-largest thrift, first disclosed that it 
would post a fourth-quarter loss last November, blaming troubled loans on 
commercial projects and apartment buildings. Most of those projects are in 
Arizona, Texas and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western Senior Vice President Ian D. Campbell said Great Western believes 
that it has done nothing wrong. "We stand by the integrity of our 1989 
financial statements. We believe they fairly and accurately represent our 
financial condition," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western is one of several financial institutions coming under extensive 
SEC review. The reviews tend to center on whether loan losses are being 
disclosed promptly. Institutions are being investigated in the wake of the 
nation's S&amp;L debacle and huge real estate problems suffered by banks in the 
Northeast, Southeast and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate Bancorp, for example, has been the subject of a similar 
informal inquiry related to disclosures of real estate problems last year in 
its Texas and Arizona units. A spokesman for the Los Angeles-based banking firm 
said Wednesday that the SEC requested documents in April, but the spokesman 
added that the bank has received no additional requests since then.

GIRL IN STOLEN CAR FOUND UNHARMED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE 6-YEAR-OLD KNOCKED ON A STRANGER'S APARTMENT DOOR AFTER THIEVES 
DITCHED CAR. POLICE BELIEVE THEY ABANDONED VEHICLE 'BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT 
ANY PART OF A KIDNAPING.'

<P>
A 6-year-old girl who was asleep on the back seat of her mother's car when it 
was stolen in Inglewood early Wednesday morning was found unhurt seven hours 
later when she knocked on an apartment door in South-Central Los Angeles, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lenesha Lynn Thomas told the apartment residents, who fed her breakfast while 
she waited for police, that she awoke when two men in the car started laughing 
at her. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police said they believe that the same two men earlier staged a 
"bump-and-rob" accident -- driving another car that rear-ended one driven by 
the child's mother, Katherine Toney, 26, then commandeering the car when she 
got out to check for damage. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves apparently abandoned Toney's car five miles away on West 75th 
Street when they saw the nightgown-clad girl in the back, Officer Calvin L. 
Smith said. "They got rid of the car because they didn't want any part of a 
kidnaping," he speculated. 
</P>
<P>
Lenesha was reunited with her mother, grandmother and aunt at the Inglewood 
police station shortly after 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. When she saw the camera crews 
and reporters awaiting her arrival, she grabbed a police officer's hand, then 
spotted her mother and ran to her with arms outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
The child's grandmother, Judy Wilson, said she spent the early morning hours 
anxiously waiting by the phone for word from police, while the mother and her 
boyfriend scoured area streets looking for Lenesha. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the apartment building at 127 W. 75th St. said they awoke about 7 
a.m. to find a car blocking the driveway and a little girl playing outside. 
Most said they believed that the child's parents were inside visiting someone. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was pulled up in the yard, nice and neat," said Melissa Hannibal, 25, 
who lives downstairs, closest to where the car was left. "I didn't really think 
anything about it until I saw she was getting back in the car and she was 
crying." 
</P>
<P>
Lenesha climbed the long flight of stairs to ask resident Ella Wilson for help, 
Hannibal said. Wilson called police, then cooked the girl a breakfast of 
scrambled eggs, bacon and grits while Hannibal brought her a red sweater and a 
pair of her 3-year-old son's socks. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'I've been kidnaped.' She was crying really hysterically," Hannibal 
said. "Then she said, 'I'm cold.' " 
</P>
<P>
Police said Toney was driving through Inglewood just after midnight, returning 
home from taking her sister to the airport, when a black Nissan sedan pulled up 
and lightly hit Toney's car from the rear near Century Boulevard and Van Ness 
Avenue. Toney followed the Nissan onto side streets until the car stopped. When 
she left her car to survey the damage, the passenger in the Nissan jumped in 
and drove it away, quickly followed by the Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects and only very general descriptions of the driver and 
passenger. Both were teen-agers, one of them had long, curly hair and acne 
scars and was wearing a black and white checkered shirt and black pants. Smith 
said investigators are trying to lift fingerprints from Toney's car, which 
sustained minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
When originally reported, the crime resembled a hoax pulled three weeks ago in 
which a woman reported her car stolen with her daughter inside. In that case, 
police discovered later that the woman had created the story about the child, 
probably to engender faster police action in locating the car. 
</P>
<P>
"But as far as we can tell, this one is totally legitimate," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Lenesha was examined at the police station and found to be unhurt.

A POPULAR CAR REPAIR SHOP FACES EVICTION IN ROUND 2 OF . . . ; 
</P>
<P>
JERRY VS. HIS LANDLORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry's car repair shop sits on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Selby 
Avenue in Westwood, a reminder to its neighbors of a time before big office 
buildings and trendy boutiques started swallowing up small workaday businesses 
like Jerry McCormac's. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a neighborhood merchant who stayed," said Westwood resident Ron Fields, 
an interior designer. "It's not just a place for my car, but a place I can stop 
in and talk. He's a reminder we have a neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Westwood residents cared enough about McCormac, who has been in business 26 
years, that they rallied to save the shop two years ago when Weyerhaeuser 
Mortgage Co. planned an office project along several blocks of Santa Monica 
Boulevard that included McCormac's old spot on the corner of Westholme Avenue. 
The company agreed to relocate the shop during construction, and to incorporate 
McCormac's business into the finished complex. 
</P>
<P>
But now McCormac's shop is threatened again, because Weyerhaeuser is trying to 
evict him. Monday, McCormac will go to court to answer company charges that he 
Failed to pay rent, sign a new lease and agree to relocate to an underground 
site when construction is finished. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to get rid of me," McCormac said from the temporary quarters 
four blocks west of the construction site, where Weyerhaeuser moved him in 
April. McCormac admits that he was late paying rent. But he said that his 
checks were returned and that the other issues are "pure harassment." 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect they never intended to perform under the . . . agreement," Chip 
Chasalow, a Holmby-Westwood Property Owners Assn. board member, said of 
Weyerhaeuser. His group was among those that worked to get the agreement that 
saved McCormac's business two years ago. "I believe we were snookered." 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Carroll, an attorney with Latham &amp; Watkins, a law firm 
representing Weyerhaeuser against McCormac, disputed this, saying: "It's not 
like we're trying to boot him out for no reason." Carroll said the outstanding 
issues are not monetary, though he noted the company is paying about $9,000 a 
month to set McCormac up in his temporary location. Under the agreement worked 
out by the community groups, the company cannot increase McCormac's rent, which 
is about $4,000 a month. Carroll called McCormac "uncooperative" about settling 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
McCormac said that before the eviction proceedings, Weyerhaeuser offered him 
money to leave but he turned it down. "I didn't want to leave this area, and 
with costs now, it wasn't enough" to reestablish himself locally, he said. 
Weyerhaeuser Vice President James C. Smith would only say "discussions" had 
been held on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they offered him a little money and when he didn't accept, they took 
a very tough stance," Chasalow said. 
</P>
<P>
To supporters like Chasalow, McCormac, 47, is a treasured local character who 
acts like a middle-aged "Fonz," the character on TV's "Happy Days." McCormac 
walks through his shop with the loping stride of a teen-ager, has a shock of 
wavy white hair, maintains a perpetual tan and always sports sunglasses. 
McCormac keeps the top of his shirt unbuttoned, showing off the gold necklace 
on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Locals smile at McCormac's version of "cool" but prize his warmth and 
generosity. Chasalow remembers the time McCormac shut down so local children 
could run a carwash to raise money. Fields likes the idea of someone knowing 
him well enough to wave when he drives by. 
</P>
<P>
Fields is also upset that even if the eviction attempt fails, the company would 
put McCormac underground. "You wouldn't be able to see him," he said. "It's 
typical corporate Big Brother." 
</P>
<P>
McCormac said that before the move to the temporary shop, it was hard to stay 
open because the company dug holes and left mounds of dirt so high "you could 
only see the roof of my station from the street. A lot of people thought I'd 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
McCormac said that he is broke but that community residents have assisted him 
with legal help and rent on the shop and an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was and continues to be our position that we must preserve small businesses 
in the community," Chasalow said of the Holmby-Westwood Property Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Westwood Homeowners' Assn. has not taken a position on McCormac's 
business, president Joyce Foster said preserving small merchants is an ongoing 
concern.

HOPE HALVES PARKLAND COST TO $10 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: REP. BEILENSON NEGOTIATED THE NEW PRICE. THE DEAL STILL HINGES ON 
A LAND SWAP BETWEEN THE U.S. AND A DEVELOPER.

<P>
Bob Hope has agreed to cut in half the $20-million price he had negotiated for 
transferring about 5,700 acres of his mountain property in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties for public use if the National Park Service approves a 
controversial land exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement was negotiated by Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), 
a leading proponent of preserving open space in the Santa Monica Mountains. His 
support significantly enhances the swap's prospects, backers and opponents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A good deal for the public has just gotten even better," Beilenson said 
Wednesday. "There will probably never again be an opportunity to gain so much 
valuable open space in Southern California at so little cost to the public." 
</P>
<P>
The price tag, disclosed in April, was considered below the market value of 
Hope's three parcels in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The pact remains contingent on Park Service approval of an exchange of 59 acres 
of federally owned land in Cheeseboro Canyon for about 1,100 acres that Hope 
owns on the adjacent Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option on Jordan Ranch, is seeking 
the Cheeseboro parcel for an access road to 750 homes and a golf course that it 
proposes to build on the remainder of Hope's 2,308-acre ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The $20 million was to be paid with funds approved under a conservation 
initiative passed by California voters on June 5. Beilenson said the 
$10-million savings would be used to buy additional properties for the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
The park hopes to use the savings to help purchase its top priority, a 248-acre 
parcel in Calabasas for use as a park headquarters and visitors' center. The 
land is owned by Soka University, which is planning a major expansion and has 
refused to sell the property. 
</P>
<P>
The double-barreled announcement of the new deal and Beilenson's support for it 
is a major shot in the arm for proponents of the swap, which has divided 
environmentalists. A day earlier, Sen. Pete Wilson, the California Republican 
gubernatorial nominee, and Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) became the 
first lawmakers to express public support for the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"This has got to send a real signal to Washington," said Joseph T. Edmiston, 
executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the architect 
of the original land-swap deal. "Tony Beilenson is a guy who's viewed as the 
conscience of the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson said he recently contacted both Park Service officials, to encourage 
them to approve the exchange, and Rep. Sidney R. Yates (D-Ill.), chairman of a 
key House subcommittee, to inform him of his support for it. 
</P>
<P>
Yates chairs the interior subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, 
which oversees funding of land acquisition for national parks, including in the 
Santa Monicas. Opponents of the land swap had asked Yates' panel to block the 
exchange. The subcommittee could do so by prohibiting the Park Service from 
using any of the fiscal 1991 funds for the Santa Monicas to pay for a required 
environmental review of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) on Tuesday made the same request of the interior 
subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson said his endorsement of the proposal "makes a great deal of 
difference to (Yates), and I think that he and his committee will be supportive 
of the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Donald J. Hellmann, an attorney for the Wilderness Society and a leading critic 
of the swap, acknowledged that Beilenson's action, while not unexpected, was a 
blow to opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Congressman Yates certainly listens to Mr. Beilenson," Hellman said. "We're 
disappointed that he doesn't feel the Jordan Ranch is worth preserving." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the exchange have maintained that the Park Service should pursue 
its longstanding goal of buying Jordan Ranch. Beilenson and others have said 
this is not financially feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson said he negotiated the reduced price with Peter Kyros, general 
partner of Potomac Investment, during a series of phone calls and meetings in 
Washington. The lawmaker said he proposed the 50% reduction in the price tag, 
which Kyros worked out with Hope. 
</P>
<P>
The $10 million is to pay for most of Hope's 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch in the 
Santa Susana Mountains. The remaining 700 acres of the property, as well as 177 
acres of Corral Canyon in Malibu, would be donated by Hope to the conservancy, 
with the Corral Canyon property eventually going to the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson said that the entire deal, however, could be jeopardized by 
slow-growth advocate Maria VanderKolk's defeat of Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer 
in Ventura County last week. VanderKolk opposes the Cheeseboro Canyon land-swap 
and made it a major campaign issue.

BUS DRIVER IN DRUNK CASE IS SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A school bus driver jailed when he showed up drunk at his sentencing hearing 
returned to court a day later Wednesday and was sentenced to 32 months in 
prison for driving his bus while intoxicated and using an alias to get a 
driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Keith Lone, 40, sat quietly in a blue jail uniform as Van Nuys Superior 
Court Judge James M. Coleman discussed sentencing options. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Lone, Coleman let stand a plea-bargain that was agreed to before 
his appearance in court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lone had appeared for sentencing Tuesday disheveled and drunk, and disrupted 
proceedings by yelling, "No way, Jose" as his attorney tried to quiet him. He 
was held in Los Angeles County Jail overnight on Coleman's orders after his 
blood-alcohol level was measured at .35% -- more than four times the 0.08% 
level at which a person is legally presumed to be intoxicated, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Stephen Plafker. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had speculated Tuesday that Lone's intoxication could prompt 
Coleman to reject a plea-bargain reached in March. 
</P>
<P>
Lone had pleaded guilty to two charges that stemmed from his arrival drunk last 
January at an Encino elementary school, where he was to pick up children. In 
exchange, prosecutors had agreed to drop an additional count of driving under 
the influence and driving with a suspended license and agreed to ask for a 
sentence of no more than two years and eight months in prison. Conviction on 
all four charges would have carried a possible sentence of four years and eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Lone's attorney, Thom Tibor, argued Wednesday that Coleman should not penalize 
his client for having shown up intoxicated for the court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcoholism is a disease," Tibor said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gloria Mas told Coleman that prosecutors were willing to 
abide by the plea-bargain. "I don't think it's right for us to punish him for 
that because he's not being tried for that," Mas said of Lone's conduct, noting 
that Lone's guilty plea saved the time and expense of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
The judge agreed that because Lone did not drive to court while intoxicated 
Tuesday he would allow the plea bargain to stand. In an interview later, 
Coleman said he agreed with Tibor that Lone's problem is alcoholism and that he 
believed it "more important to get the man in prison and away from here" than 
to reject the plea-bargain and send the case to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The judge added that "the worst" sanctions Lone could have faced for coming to 
court intoxicated were contempt of court or public drunkenness, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't require further expenditure of time, energy and money" for a 
few extra months in prison, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lone, 40, secured a driver's license and a job with the Laidlaw school bus 
company under the alias Harold Keith Holmes to hide five prior drunk driving 
convictions and a lengthy arrest record for crimes including robbery, burglary 
and auto theft, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
A probation report released Wednesday quoted Lone as acknowledging that his 
drinking "got out of hand," saying he drinks a half a pint of alcohol a day. He 
"now states he is very sorry" for the school bus incident, the probation 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Lone said that he began drinking heavily in 1986 after his mother died, the 
report said, but added that his prior drunk driving convictions occurred 
between 1982 and 1985. The probation officer concluded that Lone "has virtually 
no regard for anyone's life, not even his own" and "needs to be stopped 
immediately, and for the greatest period of time." 
</P>
<P>
With credit for work time and good behavior, Lone probably will serve no more 
than 16 months, Coleman said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GABOR TO GIVE UP APPEAL OF SLAPPING 
CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor has decided to give up her court appeal to have her 
conviction for slapping a Beverly Hills motorcycle policeman reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just tired of it, and 72 hours isn't going to kill her," her publicist, 
Phil Paladino, said of the three-day jail sentence Gabor has said she will 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
Paladino made his comments Wednesday, the eve of the first anniversary of the 
famous slap heard around the world. "As Zsa Zsa would say, you can't beat City 
Hall," Paladino said. "In her heart, she's innocent." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, 72, still has to notify the court that she is dropping her appeal, her 
spokesman said, adding that she will probably serve the sentence "within the 
month." Gabor was convicted of striking Beverly Hills Police Officer Paul 
Kramer during a traffic stop last June 14.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALDANA ATTACKER ORDERED TO TRIAL ON LETTER 
THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scottish drifter who nearly killed actress Theresa Saldana in a 1982 knife 
attack was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on five felony counts of sending 
her threatening letters from prison. 
</P>
<P>
"There is sufficient evidence to hold (the) defendant," Los Angeles Municipal 
Court Judge Alma Soper said after dismissing three of the charges against 
Arthur Jackson, 54. 
</P>
<P>
Soper scheduled arraignment for June 19 and ordered Jackson held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, shackled and wearing blue jail overalls, said nothing during the 
30-minute hearing. Saldana said in a statement released by her security chief 
Gavin de Becker that she was "very grateful." The actress stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's hearing was the first time since sentencing in 1982 that Saldana was 
face-to-face with Jackson, originally charged with 16 felony counts of menacing 
the actress, and the man who rescued her during the attack on March 15, 1982.

TORRANCE SUES ITS INSURER FOR REFUSING PAYMENT ON CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance city officials, outraged that their insurance carrier has refused to 
pay a $7.7-million judgment against the city, filed suit against the company 
Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment was ordered in the highly publicized case in which a 19-year-old 
San Pedro youth was killed in a 1984 traffic collision with off-duty Torrance 
Police Sgt. Rollo Green. Jurors found that the Police Department covered up for 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
In its lawsuit, the city alleges that Protective National Insurance Co. of 
Omaha, Neb., and its parent companies have cheated a number of California 
cities and counties in recent years by refusing to make payments on legitimate 
claims. The other municipalities include the cities of Fullerton and Hawthorne 
and Sacramento County. 
</P>
<P>
The company "has engaged and continues to engage in a pattern and practice of 
fraudulent and illegal activity . . . in order to retain for itself and its 
members funds that are legitimately owing to its insureds," the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which alleges fraud, breach of faith and breach of contract, also 
cites federal anti-racketeering laws. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a financially strapped city that bought insurance against this very 
thing," said David Pettit, one of the attorneys who filed the suit for the 
city. "Now Protective National has just walked away from their 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the worst bad-faith cases I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit charges that Protective National has acted deliberately to withhold 
money from a number of agencies holding its policies. 
</P>
<P>
Protective National vice president Jack Gaffigan, who signed a Sept. 27, 1989, 
letter rejecting the city's claim, refused to comment and referred questions to 
Los Angeles attorney Robert Baker. Baker's secretary said he was out of town 
and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the Rollo Green case, which went to trial last year, a Los Angeles Superior 
Court jury found that the Police Department covered up for Green, who had been 
drinking before the accident, by delaying a field sobriety test for more than 
an hour and by failing to measure Green's blood-alcohol level. The jury also 
concluded that the cover-up followed a Police Department "custom and policy" of 
condoning misbehavior by officers. 
</P>
<P>
The judge in the case later ordered the city to pay an additional $2.1 million 
in fees and expenses to attorneys for John Rastello, whose 19-year-old son, 
Kelly, died in the 1984 collision. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been forced to set aside nearly $12 million of its own money -- 
the cost of the judgments plus any interest that might accrue -- while it 
appeals the case, Pettit said. Protective National early this year reimbursed 
the city for the $67,000 cost of the appeal bond. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials charge that Protective National, which carried a $20-million 
policy for the city from 1982 through 1984, selected and paid the attorneys who 
defended the city and rejected numerous settlement offers before, during and 
after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the jury's decision, Rastello's attorneys offered to accept 
$7.5 million, including all fees and expenses, to avoid the additional cost of 
an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials say they demanded that Protective National accept that 
offer, but the insurance company refused. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Gaffigan sent a letter to the city saying that Protective 
National would not pay the judgments, alleging that the jury's verdict was 
based on a finding that the Police Department and the officers had committed 
intentional acts. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said Torrance was insured only for accidents. 
</P>
<P>
But Torrance's attorneys, who dispute the company's contention that the 
incident was intentional, said the point is moot anyway, because Protective 
National representatives in 1982 deleted a provision of the insurance policy 
that would have barred payment for intentional acts. 
</P>
<P>
"They have made up this problem that doesn't even exist," Pettit said. "What we 
are alleging in this complaint is that they're putting their own financial 
interests ahead of the interests of the insured." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the city received Gaffigan's letter, attorney Baker notified 
Torrance attorneys that Protective National does not have enough money to pay 
the judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Protective National, Pettit said, "has been pleading poverty . . . but we 
believe they have enough money to pay this claim if they want to." 
</P>
<P>
The company has been under state supervision for nearly four years, according 
to Nebraska insurance regulators, who have barred the company from writing any 
new policies since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Quine, assistant chief examiner in the Nebraska Department of Insurance, 
said that as of March 31, the company reported net assets of $18.6 million.

PANEL BACKS JAPANESE BID FOR YACHT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rejecting a plea to stop the sale of public assets to foreign investors, Los 
Angeles County's Small Craft Harbor Commission on Wednesday endorsed a Japanese 
bid to buy a long-term lease on a Marina del Rey yacht center for $5.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors still must approve the sale of the Aggie Cal Yacht 
Center to an American subsidiary of Yamaha Motors. The 7.2-acre property 
includes 115 boat slips, a boat showroom, a storage area and a parking lot. 
After emerging from a lengthy closed-door executive session with a county 
lawyer, the commission voted 4 to 1 in favor of the sale to Yamaha. There was 
no public debate. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is the latest in a series of foreign investments in the publicly owned 
marina. Businesses at the marina operate on long-term leases with the county 
that can be bought and sold much like conventional real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting said Principal Deputy County Counsel Robert Rodolf 
told commissioners the county cannot discriminate against foreign investors. 
Rodolf also argued that the county could be held liable if the transfer was 
blocked solely because the investor is a foreign corporation. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner Herbert Strickstein, a Century City attorney, disagreed. He 
argued unsuccessfully against the sale in executive session, saying that the 
county should stand up for principle even if that involved some risk. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to publicly owned property, we should draw the line," 
Strickstein said in an interview. "We have a valuable asset in the marina. It 
is public property. It is different than private property. I don't think we 
should sell off public assets to foreign corporations." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the county Department of Beaches and Harbors urged approval of the 
deal. The county will receive $14,000 in processing fees on the sale by Aggie 
Cal owner Marjorie Agajanian, but will not share in the profit because there 
was no such provision in the original lease signed in 1962.

Will Mukhamedov Dance in L.A.? Despite Tuesday's announcement of Irek 
Mukhamedov's defection from the Bolshoi Ballet to Britain's Royal Ballet, the 
acclaimed Soviet dancer could still appear on a portion of the Bolshoi's 
upcoming U.S. tour, including the Aug. 7-19 dates in Los Angeles. On Wednesday, 
a spokeswoman for the Royal Ballet said that Mukhamedov is committed to the 
Royal Ballet until Aug. 4, when the company takes off until Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"What he does in that period is entirely up to him," she said. The Bolshoi's 
American tour representatives have said the dancer would be invited to 
participate in the tour when he's available, and that they intend to negotiate 
the question of that availability in the next few days. BETH KLEID

SWEET DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diet-minded sweet freaks know that the best way to deal with candy and pastry 
shops is to think of goodies as artworks. You can look at chocolate roses, 
gingerbread horses and marzipan pineapples to your heart's delight. You can 
love gummy bears and sugar Day of the Dead skulls as well as you love Wayne 
Thiebaud's luscious cake paintings or Giuseppe Arcimboldo's bizarre 
fruit-and-vegetable portraits. But you can't eat very many sugary treats if you 
value your figure and your teeth. 
</P>
<P>
No will power is required, however, to enjoy "The Confectioner's Art," an 
international exhibition of sweet edibles at the California Museum of Science 
and Industry in Exposition Park (to July 29). Plexiglass cases protect the 
show's confections (and your figure), which display the history and techniques 
of using sugar and chocolate as artistic media. 
</P>
<P>
This is not an eater-friendly arrangement, but the precautions may be 
unnecessary. For one thing, some of the confections appear to be suffering from 
age and travel. They looked fresher last November, when the exhibition opened 
at the elegant American Craft Museum in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, who would want to destroy Rosemary Littman's Wall Street Journal cake 
or the cake shaped into a big pair of Converse sneakers? Would you really bite 
into Dolph Gotelli's wooden chair inlaid with colored candies or Peter Rocha's 
jelly bean "painting" of the Statue of Liberty? Could you bear to ruin a 
platter of lifelike marzipan fish or a chocolate re-creation of a 12th-Century 
Spanish tapestry? These creations weren't made to be devoured; they were 
crafted for visual delectation. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say the sweet wonders are artworks in the most elevated sense of 
the word, but they are wonderful curiosities. The "art" in the exhibition title 
refers to the high degree of skill and ingenuity required to make the 
confections. Consider such achievements as a chocolate Monopoly set, a bouquet 
of pastel chocolate tulips and a four-tiered cake covered with lattices and 
festooned with sugar-paste irises and lilies. Not impressed? Well, what about a 
cake replica of the White House or decorated gingerbread figures from an 
Austrian Nativity scene? 
</P>
<P>
Once you get past the stage of exclaiming over the spectacles and the 
craftsmanship, you find an educational exhibition that delves into history and 
covers a big chunk of geography. In the illustrated catalogue, for example, you 
find that when the Aztecs greeted Cortez as a god, Montezuma served him "lavish 
banquets at which chocolate flowed freely from golden goblets." After chocolate 
had been transported to Europe and sweetened with sugar, recipes were closely 
guarded. Chocolate was banned in France until Anne of Austria, who married 
Louis XIII, included chocolate secrets in her dowry and made chocolate 
respectable in the French court. 
</P>
<P>
These historical tidbits turn up in a section of the show dealing with 
materials -- sugar and chocolate. Other segments explore tools and techniques, 
shapes and forms, advertising and packaging, confections for special occasions 
and contemporary artists' work that goes "beyond tradition." 
</P>
<P>
The tools include an intriguing variety of wood and metal molds, icing tubes 
and walnut forms for sugar paste flowers. Unfortunately, there's no artist on 
duty to demonstrate how to pull and stretch marbled chocolate into bowls, vases 
and flowers, or to spin long threads of sugar, but you get the idea. As for 
shapes and forms, imagination seems to be the limit. Chocolatiers who know 
their stuff turn out full-size chocolate pliers, wrenches and scissors, as well 
as miniature typewriters, telephones, Bingo boards and Empire State Buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Such labor deserves a sweet sell, and the show offers charming examples in 
illustrated candy wrappers from the '40s and advertising posters from the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the sweetest message of the show is how confectionary traditions 
have grown up around holidays and special occasions throughout the world. Cakes 
are so essential to modern American life that a birthday or wedding celebration 
would be unthinkable without them, but "The Confectioner's Art" offers some new 
ideas. Abraham pastries, filled with marzipan and decorated to resemble the 
bearded patriarch, are presented on 50th birthdays in Holland, so that the 
recipient can feel a little less old and a little more wise. If your 65th 
birthday is coming up, you might consider something like Tom Ambrosina's jazzy 
cake, ringed with multicolor numerals and uplifting slogans: "65 Cheers for 
Senior Citizens" and "Look Alive at 65." 
</P>
<P>
Living up to their reputation, some of the contemporary artists give no thought 
to tradition. They simply rob the candy jar for raw materials, sticking candies 
on furniture, stringing them as beads and using them as tesserae in mosaics. In 
short, they do almost everything with sweets but eat them.

THE BUTCHER: A GRILLING ON THE SUBJECT OF BARBECUING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are more than a few places in this beautiful nation of ours where the 
word barbecue -- no matter how you spell it: B-B-Q, Bar-B-Q, barbeque, barbecue 
or just plain Q -- is more than a description of a cooking method, 
much-much-more. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, the word is a noun, bar-be-cue; it means pork slow-cooked 
over hickory or oak coals for hours. It means something similar in Memphis, at 
least in May. In Texas, it's beef, usually beef brisket cooked long and slow, 
not over but alongside mesquite coals. Mesquite burns hot and the secret of 
Texas Q is to cook the meat with the smoke of the wood, not the heat of it. 
</P>
<P>
We use a lot of mesquite in California, too, but there are those who would 
argue (me among them) that what we do with it is not true barbecue, but rather 
grilling, and there is a big difference. More on that a little later. 
</P>
<P>
There is probably no place in the nation where barbecue in all of its forms is 
better understood than in Kansas City, Mo. They even have a society there -- 
I'm a member -- the Kansas City Barbecue Society (KCBS), with its own 
newsletter, "The Bull Sheet," to keep members " . . . up to date in Kansas 
City" about what's new with barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
The mouth-watering aroma of barbecue is in the air everywhere in Kansas City. 
Kansas Citians in every neighborhood from downtown to the suburbs love to cook 
out in almost any weather. When they can't cook out, they are very apt to "go 
out" for B-B-Q. Bill Venable III (Wild Bill) lists 46 barbecue restaurant 
locations in his book, "Kansas City Barbecue." He also sets us right on what is 
and what is not barbecue: 
</P>
<P>
"There are several types of outdoor cooking that seem to have been lumped into 
the category of 'barbecue.' When you get home from work and you throw a steak 
on the back yard cooker, some call this barbecuing. Let's set the record 
straight, the aforementioned act is 'grilling.' When you cook anything outside 
for a period of less than an hour, this is, again, grilling. When we cook a 
chicken, brisket, or other larger piece of meat, it will take a little longer, 
we'll use a lot cooler fire, and the sweet smell of smoke will penetrate the 
meat. This, class, is 'barbecue.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another "Pig Out Publication," the unofficial "bible" of the Kansas City 
Barbecue Society, titled the Passion of Barbecue, organizes cookout recipes 
according to "the Bone System." The "One Bone" section describes grilling 
techniques and provides recipes for quick preparation. Sub-titled "Home by Five 
-- Barbecue by Seven," it contains meat, poultry, and seafood recipes that take 
from 15 minutes to an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Two Bone" creations require more time. Sub-titled "a Well-spent Afternoon," 
the recipes in this section require one to four hours of slow cooking in a 
covered cooker. 
</P>
<P>
"A Smoke Marathon" is the sub-title of the "Three Bone" section which contains 
hard-core barbecue recipes for large cuts of meat that require 5 to 15 hours to 
prepare. 
</P>
<P>
If you are sincerely interested in barbecue cooking and/or eating, I recommend 
that you become a member of KCBS. For more information and a membership 
application (there are restrictions -- you must be at least sort of in favor of 
general foolishness), contact the Kansas City Barbecue Society, 11514 Hickman 
Mills Drive, Kansas City, Mo. 64134, (816) 765-5801. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a "Two Bone" recipe for baby back ribs that is guaranteed to 
have you smackin' your lips and smellin' of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
BARBECUED PORK LOIN BABY BACK RIBS 
</P>
<P>
1 slab pork loin baby back ribs 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup vinegar 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
Dry Spice Rub 
</P>
<P>
Skin ribs. Remove thin membrane on bone side of slab so smoke can permeate 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
Combine chicken stock, soy sauce, oil, vinegar, sugar and garlic and mix well. 
Add ribs and marinate in refrigerator 2 hours to overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Remove ribs from marinade. Sprinkle with Dry Spice Rub. Cook over medium coals, 
225 degrees until internal temperature registers 160 degrees on meat 
thermometer, about 4 hours. Baste with marinade or sprinkle lightly with dry 
seasoning every 30 minutes during cooking process. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Dry Spice Rub 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon garlic powder 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon paprika 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon thyme 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon oregano 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon rosemary 
</P>

LOTTERY PRIZE IS 30-YEAR MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
LA MIRADA CONDUCTS DRAWING FOR 45 NEW CONDOS THAT FIRST-TIME BUYERS OTHERWISE 
COULDN'T AFFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the winners in Tuesday morning's lottery, there were no instant millions, 
just a crack at a 30-year mortgage, a chance at the ever-more-elusive dream of 
home ownership in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Up for grabs were 45 brand-new condominiums, which La Mirada will purchase at 
market value. The city will resell them at a discount to people who could not 
otherwise afford the one- and two-bedroom units. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's drawing at the La Mirada Civic Theatre was held to establish the 
order in which applicants will become eligible to buy these subsidized condos. 
Although all entrants will be notified by telephone or mail, more than 100 
nervous renters could not wait, including 33-year-old Antoinette Uraine. 
</P>
<P>
Although she works for Bank of America, the divorced mother of three said she 
can't save enough for a down payment after rent, food and child-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be a great opportunity, a nice start for my family," she said. 
"I've been renting a long time, since I left my parents' house when I was 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't come here today, then I thought, no, this is too exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting near her, Lisa Parish, 28, promised to scream if she got a low number. 
In the meantime, she and her 3-year-old daughter were trying to calm 
4-month-old Bryan. Her husband is a pastor, which she figured could only help 
her lottery chances. 
</P>
<P>
Truck driver John Temple, 23, kept a lower profile after slipping in 20 minutes 
late and missing the first 30 picks. 
</P>
<P>
The last time John Wohrman set foot in the theater was three years ago when he 
saw "Little Shop of Horrors." Condo or no condo, the 22-year-old painter will 
be married Saturday. He had already scouted the units in The Glen, which are 
part of a 150-acre development with permits for 282 condominiums and 548 homes. 
"They're great, brand-new, beautiful," he said, "in the middle of everything." 
</P>
<P>
But outside his price range. 
</P>
<P>
The Glen's most affordable one-bedroom unit costs about $118,000. Although a 
bargain compared to prices in other parts of the county, the units remain 
beyond the reach of many working families, said Dick Austin, an assistant vice 
president with Imco Realty Services, the Santa Rosa-based mortgage company 
arranging the financing for La Mirada. Austin estimated that, on the open 
market, a typical buyer might have to: 
</P>
<P>
* Raise about $6,500 in cash to cover the down payment and closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
* Pay upward of about $1,000 a month in a typical 30-year loan. 
</P>
<P>
* Earn more than $50,000 a year (not taking previous debts into account). 
</P>
<P>
Under the city program, income as little as $15,000 a year for individuals or 
$20,000 for families could suffice, said Don White, La Mirada's director of 
economic development. An applicant with crippling debts might fail to qualify 
for a mortgage, but many low- and moderate-income households would. 
</P>
<P>
The interest on these loans will be fixed at 8.15%. Buyers will have monthly 
payments that are no greater than a quarter of their income. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, the city council approved two separate bond issues to 
make the condominiums affordable. The first issue provided $2.55 million to 
lower the condos' purchase price. The second created a $4.1-million fund that 
will finance the mortgages at the bargain interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
The project costs local taxpayers nothing directly. Property tax revenue from 
new residential development will pay off the first debt. The condo buyers' 
mortgage payments will retire the other bond issue, which is also federally 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Only first-time property owners and La Mirada residents were eligible. The city 
approved 285 entrants for the lottery from a list of 700. 
</P>
<P>
These home buyers will not move into old, marginally renovated or cheaply 
constructed, subsidized housing. The condominiums, off Beach Boulevard south of 
Imperial Highway, are priced for upper middle-class wage earners. 
</P>
<P>
In all, "the lender benefits, the investors buying the bonds will benefit, and 
homeowners are benefiting, because it's not putting them in a financial bind," 
Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
The only obvious losers are the applicants buried at the bottom of the waiting 
list. 
</P>
<P>
In the auditorium, on the stage, atop a table, rested a gold-colored, 
translucent cylinder. The scene had a surreal game-show quality to it, with 
what would pass for a dapper, gray-suited host assisted by three attractive 
young women. The "host" was Andrew Lazzaretto, a redevelopment consultant, who 
read off the names as they were drawn from the cylinder. The women included a 
city auditor and Dana Tweedy, Lazzaretto's colleague who will administer the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
As for the audience, it was strangely silent. A few people sipped coffee, 
others clasped their hands in what looked like prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Lazzaretto and Tweedy divided the lottery into two parts: the first to create a 
waiting list for one-bedroom units, the second for the two-bedroom condos. As 
the drawing proceeded, the best numbers went to absentees, dulling any 
anticipated celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Parish missed hearing her number while escorting her daughter to the restroom. 
It was 49. Although only about 25 two-bedroom units would be available, "it's a 
good chance," she said. "People might not pass the interviewing. You never 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Uraine, the divorced bank employee, received a number that probably put her out 
of the running. "The only thing I can say is that the Lord has something better 
in mind for me," she said, disappointed, "so I'll just wait and see what He has 
to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Most in attendance drew numbers that put them low on the eligibility list. They 
departed quietly on learning their fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought people would get more excited," said Tweedy, the consultant. "It was 
kind of a dead crowd. I think maybe people didn't get a lot of sleep last night 
worrying about this." 
</P>
<P>
After the numbers reached three digits, Wohrman, the husband-to-be, left in 
disgust. Lazzaretto called Wohrman's name about five minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Temple, the truck driver who arrived late, had not yet heard his 
name called. He works a night shift, and it had not been easy to crawl out of 
bed that morning. 
</P>
<P>
By 10:30 a.m., at the lottery's conclusion, Temple was still waiting to hear 
his name. He approached the stage to learn his number. 
</P>
<P>
It was 3. His card had been selected before he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom's going to be very excited," he said. "She told me to keep my fingers 
crossed. There'll definitely be a celebration."

LAWSUITS SPARK A 'FAMILY FEUD' IN CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
POMONA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Gilbert Moegerle was James Dobson's faithful sidekick, a kind of 
spiritual Ed McMahon to the Christian radio broadcaster's Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, the only television show they resemble is "Family Feud." 
</P>
<P>
Moegerle contends that Dobson forced him to resign in 1987 from Focus on the 
Family, the Pomona-based Christian broadcasting and publishing empire, after 
Moegerle was divorced and announced that he intended to marry his former 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson feared "that my deteriorating (first) marriage would hurt his reputation 
and ministry, that his credibility would be damaged by the revelation that his 
very visible sidekick could not hold his own marriage together," charged 
Moegerle, who has filed suit against his old boss and Focus on the Family in 
Pomona Superior Court. His new wife, Carolyn, who also claims that she was 
forced to resign from Focus on the Family, has filed a companion suit. Their 
suits accuse Dobson and Focus on the Family with firing the couple illegally, 
invasion of privacy and causing emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, who says the Moegerles resigned voluntarily, nevertheless has 
acknowledged in a sworn declaration that the Moegerles' continued employment 
"threatened to destroy the organization's credibility, especially in an era 
replete with scandals involving religious figures." 
</P>
<P>
Today the lawsuits reach a crucial stage, as Judge Theodore Piatt will decide 
whether the Moegerles' case should be dismissed or go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lawsuits have provided a fascinating glimpse into the business 
and philosophy of Focus on the Family, which in 13 years has grown into a media 
giant that reaches and influences millions of conservative Christians and is 
one of Pomona's largest employers. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Moegerle, 46, was working for a Chicago advertising agency specializing 
in Christian media in 1977 when he met Dobson, a psychologist who was already a 
successful author of books on marriage and parenting and was beginning a radio 
program. Dobson hired the agency, and before long Moegerle assumed the role of 
radio co-host, feeding Dobson questions about marriage and family life. 
</P>
<P>
The program is heard by 1 million listeners daily on 1,400 radio stations in 
the United States and abroad, the organization said in its annual report. 
</P>
<P>
The radio show's success fueled the growth of Focus on the Family, which 
employs 700 workers at its headquarters in Pomona and took in nearly $55 
million last year, officials of the nonprofit organization said. Focus on the 
Family publishes books and magazines, produces radio programs and films, 
sponsors basketball camps, and runs a Washington lobbying organization -- the 
Family Research Council -- that works on family issues. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, a psychologist whose credentials include 14 years as associate clinical 
professor of pediatrics at USC, drew widespread mention in the secular press in 
January, 1989, when he met with serial killer Ted Bundy before Bundy's 
execution in Florida. After their videotaped conversation, Dobson said Bundy 
blamed his crimes on the availability of pornography. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Dobson said he started the organization in a two-room 
office in Arcadia to try to help families. "I knew that almost every family was 
struggling one way or another, but I didn't set out to build a ministry of this 
scope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the organization has grown to the point where it receives 10,000 
letters a day and requires a large force of counselors and other workers to 
handle requests for publications and advice. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, who has become wealthy from royalties from 11 best-selling books, 
serves Focus on the Family without salary and pays $15,000 a month to help 
cover the cost of his daily half-hour radio program. The program features 
Dobson, 54, in folksy conversation with a co-host about family life and 
Christian values. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit here talking out of my heart, and people feel like they know me," he 
said. "I meet people on the street and they hug me and cry because their family 
is in trouble and somebody seems to understand and care. They know my dog; they 
know my wife; they know my kids. Because I share personal illustrations, they 
know where I went on vacation last summer. They know what books I've written 
and things I've shared. It's very, very intimate." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, who lives with his wife in Arcadia and has two grown children, insists 
that those who work at Focus on the Family share its values. 
</P>
<P>
"All Focus on the Family employees must profess to be Christians," he said in 
his court declaration. "They must affirm in writing the Focus on the Family 
statement of faith and must provide a written personal testimony of their 
faith." Employees are required to attend daily devotions and participate in a 
monthly chapel service. 
</P>
<P>
In his court declaration, Dobson said Focus on the Family was "formed for the 
express purpose of spreading and propagating the gospel of Jesus Christ." But 
Moegerle, in his declaration, says he is amazed that Dobson would make that 
claim, because "in the 10 years we spent together, our day-to-day activities 
involved social, psychological and political issues, not primarily religious 
issues, and he would openly deny any reference to himself as a minister or 
evangelist, stating that he was a psychologist and that was the nature of his 
trade and business." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson and Moegerle do agree that their relationship became strained because of 
the problems that developed in Moegerle's first marriage. Dobson said he sent 
the couple to the "best therapist I know" for counseling, but the marriage 
failed anyway. Because of his marital problems, Moegerle said, he left the 
radio program in 1985 and was reassigned to work on film production. Moegerle 
was divorced in 1986 and married the former Carolyn Alexander in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson said Moegerle's divorce and remarriage "created disturbing theological 
and institutional problems for Focus on the Family. Several biblical passages . 
. . decry divorce. As stated in Malachi 2:16, God 'hates' divorce. Further, it 
is believed generally within mainline Evangelical Christian circles that 
remarriage after a divorce constitutes a form of adultery in the eyes of God." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "In sum, divorce and remarriage, absent unfaithfulness, is biblically 
unacceptable." And since there were no allegations of infidelity, Dobson said, 
"Gilbert's divorce and remarriage was inconsistent with biblical teaching." 
</P>
<P>
It was also bad for the organization's image, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"Plaintiffs' continued employment also threatened the loss of donor support, 
financial and otherwise. In short, the spiritual, social and economic viability 
of Focus on the Family as a religious institution was endangered by plaintiffs' 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who took the hyphenated name of Alexander-Moegerle when they 
married, said they have been ostracized since they filed their lawsuits 19 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a gentleman tell us shortly after we filed that to file a suit against 
Dobson is to commit professional suicide," Moegerle said. Dobson is so highly 
esteemed by his followers that "it is impossible for them to imagine any 
wrongdoing, so the only thing they can conceive of is that Carolyn and I are 
malicious." 
</P>

The couple are asking for punitive damages and compensation for lost wages and 
benefits. Moegerle was earning about $60,000 a year, including a tax-free 
$30,000 annual housing allowance. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has found only occasional employment in his field since leaving 
Focus on the Family and has enrolled at Cal State Fullerton with plans to 
obtain a master's degree in communications so that he can become a teacher. His 
wife, who worked as a secretary and as children's video coordinator at Focus on 
the Family, is studying horticulture at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the Moegerles and Dobson has become bitter. The couple have 
written letters to former co-workers giving their side of the dispute and 
Dobson has accused them of being vindictive and spreading distortions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Moegerles say they continue to admire Dobson's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done an awful lot of good," Moegerle said. "He has provided a tremendous 
service to a lot of people. His forte is helping you with your marriage and 
helping you with your kids -- that's his strength."

TASK FORCE URGES MALL BE DROPPED FROM PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: INSTEAD, THE REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT 2,000 UNITS OF HOUSING BE 
INCLUDED IN THE COMPLEX FOR THE FARMERS MARKET SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The developer of a proposed shopping mall at the Farmers Market said the owners 
would lose money if they followed the recommendation of a mayoral task force to 
build 2,000 units of housing at the site. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's going to have to compromise, but they're off the wall," said 
Norman Elkin, vice president of Urban Investment and Development Co., a 
Chicago-based firm that is working with the A. F. Gilmore Co. to develop 
Gilmore's property at the corner of 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Their latest plans call for 2 million square feet of development at the 
frequently jammed intersection, including a 1-million-square-foot shopping 
center, an office building, a hotel and 150 housing units. 
</P>
<P>
But the task force named by Mayor Tom Bradley and the American Institute of 
Architects turned the plan on its head in a report that was aired at a 
community meeting Tuesday night. The report is not a part of the strictly 
regulated city planning process, but the qualifications of its independent 
experts, and its sponsorship by the mayor, assured its importance as a resource 
document, members of the Los Angeles City Planning Commission said when it was 
presented to them last week. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn up by volunteers including planners, architects, a developer and a 
gerontologist, the report found that "the impact of a regional shopping center 
would so severely degrade the streets and neighborhood character of 
Beverly-Fairfax that the proposal must be restructured." (The gerontologist was 
added because of the high concentration of senior citizens in the area). 
</P>
<P>
The experts on the Beverly-Fairfax/Miracle Mile Urban Design Workshop 
recommended that retail space at the Farmers Market development be slashed to 
one-tenth of what the developers wanted, with apartment houses taking the place 
of the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
An accompanying sketch showed six mid-rise apartment structures looming over 
the Farmers Market and the nearby CBS complex, prompting Elkin to call it a 
"Chinese wall." He said it looks like the crowded tenements of the South Bronx 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"You can reach across to borrow toilet paper. . . . ," Elkin said. "The whole 
area will be in shadow constantly and block all the views of the Hollywood 
Hills." 
</P>
<P>
With the owners of the nearby Park Labrea apartment complex planning to add 
about 2,500 units at the same time, both of them would be competing for the 
same tenants if the projects go ahead as recommended by the task force, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a program with some economic integrity," he said, arguing that 
a shopping center needs at least two major department stores to attract enough 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The developers have lined up Nordstrom's, May Co. and possibly a third major 
department store for the site, but the task force said that this would attract 
too much traffic. Instead, it suggested that no more than one major department 
store be added to the existing Farmers Market, along with smaller stores 
designed to serve neighborhood needs and the tourist trade. The Farmers Market 
is the city's second most popular tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he was eager to hear the owners' response, noting that other 
developers have recently decided to shift the emphasis from commercial to 
housing in their proposed large-scale projects. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Blumenfeld, planning adviser to the mayor, said that these included the 
Playa Vista and Channel Gateway projects, both of which are expected to get 
through the city planning process with little difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that dropping the shopping center in favor of a housing 
development might affect the economic viability of the Farmers Market project. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why the mayor said, 'Let's look at what they come up with,' " she said. 
"Park Labrea and the Farmers Market need to look at it and come back. I'm sure 
there's some point at which too much housing is too much, but I don't know 
exactly what that is." 
</P>
<P>
The Park Labrea project also includes a major office complex along Wilshire 
Boulevard, its developers having dropped an earlier proposal for a regional 
shopping center of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Elkin said he expects that his firm and Gilmore will respond to the mayor once 
they have more thoroughly analyzed the report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way of carrying on a dialogue. Usually good things come of it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Gilmore proposal is not expected to require approval by the mayor 
-- Park Labrea's will because of proposed zoning changes -- both projects face 
a series of public hearings and reviews by city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Gilmore project only requires a change in its subdivision map, a step that 
ordinarily would only require the signature of a city bureaucrat, but it is 
expected to go to the City Council for a vote if opponents appeal the 
subdivision change. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Labrea project, however, requires the mayor's signature because zoning 
changes are carried out by city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, City Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the area, will 
have a major voice in determining the outcome, but Renee Weitzer, planning 
deputy for City Councilman John Ferraro, said Ferraro will not make public his 
response to the Farmers Market and Park Labrea proposals until later this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"For now," she said, "we just want to keep our options open." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district lies just to the north, has 
spoken against a major shopping center in the area. He said the Beverly Center 
and the Westside Pavilion have damaged surrounding neighborhoods by adding too 
much traffic and attracting other development. 
</P>
<P>
"As a city official, I'm here to convince you that whether this is a Jewish 
neighborhood, a Korean neighborhood or a mixed neighborhood, let's keep it a 
neighborhood," he said at one of the meetings held to get public input for the 
report. "And no matter whether it's black or Latino or anything else, a 
regional shopping center will kill it," attracting 50,000 car trips a day. 
</P>
<P>
After the report was released, Yaroslavsky said he expects it to play an 
important role in determining the future of the area, because no other studies 
have been done for the Beverly-Fairfax and Miracle Miracle neighborhoods in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"While this was an advisory report, I think it would be unwise for the 
decision-makers and the policy-makers -- the City Council, Planning Commission 
and planning staff -- to disregard what such an array of competent 
professionals has concluded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Diana Plotkin, president of the Beverly-Wilshire Homes Assn., warned that 
supporters of its recommendations would have to keep a close eye on the city 
planning process as officials mull over the plans in closing months. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just one step," she said. "Since no law forces developers to abide by 
it, I don't see much chance of developers abiding by any recommendations from 
the goodness of their hearts." 
</P>
<P>
She also urged that city planners limit the number of car trips generated by 
any new development to the number now using the site. 
</P>
<P>
Among its other recommendations, the task force urged that Forest City 
Development, owners of Park Labrea, maintain the facade of the May Co. store at 
the corner of Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard as the grand entry to an 
office complex planned at the site. 
</P>
<P>
The store, which is distinguished by a gleaming gold mosaic in the shape of a 
huge perfume bottle, is slated for demolition in the company's latest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kraden, a spokesman for Forest City, said the firm would not be able to 
comment immediately on the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is technically outside the (planning) process, so it's very hard to 
speculate what the effect would be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force also called for a moratorium on museum expansions in Hancock 
Park, designation of 25 buildings on the Miracle Mile stretch of Wilshire 
Boulevard as a historic area, development of large parking structures to serve 
the commercial strips of Melrose, Fairfax and La Brea avenues. 
</P>
<P>
No expansions are planned for Hancock Park, spokesmen for the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art and the George Page Museum said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Jebejian, a leader of merchants along Melrose, said he objected to 
the idea of big parking structures, saying it would be better to allow property 
owners to tear down houses to make parking lots along the alleys behind the 
Melrose shops.

ART CENTER COST SOARS TO $46.4 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: CERRITOS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WILL PROBABLY DISCUSS THE GRANDER 
BUILDING PLAN IN BUDGET SESSIONS NEXT WEEK.

<P>
The cost of the Community Art Center, which has soared from an estimated $17.5 
million to $46.4 million in three years, is likely to dominate discussion 
during next week's hearing on the city's 1990-91 budget. 
</P>
<P>
The glass and granite building is under construction in the Towne Center 
redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
The budget will be discussed in a council study session at 7 p.m. Monday and at 
a public hearing at 7 p.m. June 21. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a piece of change, no doubt about it," Councilman Paul W. Bowlen said of 
the 1,800-seat center. He said he is not sure he would have voted for the arts 
center had he been on the council when it was approved in 1987. He has been on 
the council for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little surprised to hear that," Councilman John Crawley said when told 
about the $46.4-million cost. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago when he ran unsuccessfully for a council seat, he opposed the 
idea of the arts center. He was elected to the council in April this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a different situation now that I'm on the council," Crawley said. "The 
deal is done and I'm going to be as supportive as I can be." However, he added, 
he will ask for a complete accounting of the costs when the council meets 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ann B. Joynt, who has long opposed the center, said: "I figure that by 
the time we get through all the change orders we'll be at about $50 million." 
</P>
<P>
Joynt said she will ask the city staff to prepare a detailed programming plan 
for the council, because she wants to see that the facility is used to its 
maximum. "I want to make sure that the programming itself reflects what people 
want and that it reflects our many cultures," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At budget time last year, the cost of the 125,000-square-foot arts center was 
$35.1 million. However, the council should not be surprised that the cost shown 
in this year's budget is up $11 million, said Kurt Swanson, the city's director 
of human affairs. He will oversee the arts center management. 
</P>
<P>
The council last August awarded construction contracts that came in much higher 
than the architect's estimate, Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
The arts center project, however, is much grander in scale than it was three 
years ago, when the council voted to build it for an estimated $17.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the architect finished drawing the plans and the council added 
extra rooms for community events, as well as high-tech features such as movable 
walls, floors and seating, the estimate had risen to $31.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the lowest bids from general contractors and the construction 
managers came in at $40.9 million. That was on top of other construction costs 
such as those for acoustical consultants, theater design consultants and 
architects, Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson said nothing has changed since the contracts were signed last summer 
and that the center will be a boon to the city and to its commercial 
developers. "It's an economic draw for the area," Swanson said. The Towne 
Center redevelopment area includes a Sheraton hotel and will include 20 office 
buildings when it is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The arts center, which is to be completed early in 1992, is being paid for with 
city redevelopment and sales tax money. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson also pointed out that the change orders that Joynt is worried about 
have totaled only $61,625 so far and that the project is 25% completed. 
</P>
<P>
The overall cost is unsettling to council members. "We can't stop now. It's 
like a boat with a hole in the bottom," said Councilman Daniel Wong. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the proposed city budget that the council will discuss next week is 
$73.4 million, including the redevelopment agency's spending and all capital 
improvement spending for the agency and the city. The 1989-90 budget is $66 
million.

ceremonies for the Glendale Fire Department's Explorer Post 911 Saturday 
included a demonstration of various firefighting techniques, including the 
scaling of a burning building, left, the use of fire hoses, above, carrying a 
hose up several flights of stairs and climbing a 100-foot ladder atop a 
hook-and-ladder truck. The display of skills also included the use of Jaws of 
Life tools to rescue a "victim" trapped in a vehicle and rappeling down the 
side of a four-story building. Some of the class members, below, parade past 
the spectators. An Explorer, bottom left, watches the activities. About 175 
people attended the ceremonies. Each member of the graduating class -- 12 men 
and one woman, ages 17 to 20 -- completed nine months of training in the 
program to encourage careers in firefighting. The Explorers, all from the 
Glendale-Burbank area, will now be allowed to spend 24-hour shifts at the 
city's fire stations and to participate as observers on fire calls. The 
Glendale Fire Department's Explorer program began in 1988. Openings remain for 
the fall 1990 class. Information on registration can be obtained by calling

NEW HOUSING BIAS LAWS PROTECT DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New amendments to the federal Fair Housing Act will require most new apartments 
and condominiums to be accessible to the handicapped and could subject 
landlords who discriminate to tougher penalties, officials told representatives 
of the Glendale housing industry this week. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of federal and local officials explained the new rules to about 60 
Glendale real estate agents, landlords, bankers and builders Tuesday morning at 
a breakfast forum organized by the Glendale Department of Community Development 
and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
They said the changes are aimed at quashing discrimination against handicapped 
people, families with children and minorities as a growing population struggles 
to find housing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a history as a country and as a human race of scapegoating, of 
reacting in an almost tribal way by cutting people out," said Thomas F. Honore, 
director of fair housing for the Los Angeles office of the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
Honore said unfair housing practices seem to represent the last bastion of 
discriminatory exclusivity in a society that has gradually accepted fair access 
to education and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Stricter regulations designed to fight such discrimination will open more legal 
avenues to those who have been denied fair housing, said Gabrielle Woods, 
senior counsel for the California Assn. of Realtors. The rules will increase 
housing options for the handicapped, she said, and will set aside certain 
buildings for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Vargas, who directs housing programs for the city of Glendale, said the new 
federal law likely to have the greatest impact on the city would require new 
housing to be accessible to handicapped people. 
</P>
<P>
As of March 12, 1991, new apartments or condominiums consisting of more than 
four units must have doorways, bathrooms and kitchens wide enough to 
accommodate wheelchairs. Furthermore, light switches, thermostats and 
electrical outlets must be placed within reach of people in wheelchairs, Vargas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the physically and mentally impaired, those protected by the 
federal amendments include members of ethnic and religious minority groups, 
people with children under 18 and those who are pregnant or in the process of 
getting legal custody of children, and people with AIDS. Drug users who were 
rehabilitated in approved programs also qualify as handicapped individuals, 
Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
Woods said that before the 1988 Federal Fair Housing Law amendments became 
effective in March, 1989, people who proved they were victims of housing 
discrimination could claim only out-of-pocket damages. Now, she said, claims 
for pain and suffering and mental anguish can also be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
"Owners have to understand that if they create intentional housing barriers to 
people, it will be very costly to their businesses," Vargas said in an 
interview after the forum. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas said that about half of the complaints of discrimination received by his 
office involve families who claim that landlords are trying to create "adults 
only" units. California law has protected families with children from housing 
discrimination since 1982, but the new federal laws create two permissible ways 
to maintain an adults only building. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new amendments, young families can be turned away in favor of senior 
citizens: 
</P>
<P>
* If every resident of a housing facility was 62 years old or older when the 
amendments took effect, in which case no other criteria must be met. 
</P>
<P>
* If, at the time the law was enacted, 80% of the units housed at least one 
person over the age of 55. In this case, the building must be identified in 
writing as a senior citizens complex, and owners have to provide special 
services to seniors: transportation, perhaps, or social programs. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas said housing discrimination claims have declined in Glendale since the 
mid-1980s, when housing units were scarce and demand for them was high. 
</P>
<P>
But Vargas and other speakers at Tuesday's forum expressed fears that 
discrimination could increase as a rapidly growing immigrant population tries 
to find housing. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Mornell, executive director of the Los Angeles County Human Rights 
Commission, said one of every 10 newcomers to the United States is settling in 
the county, and housing can't keep up. The middle class is shrinking, he said, 
and hate crimes are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Mornell said Glendale has displayed a "tremendous change in attitude" toward 
minority groups and immigrants, and now has an opportunity to serve as a model 
for the nation in dealing with housing needs.

WEST COVINA STUDIES BKK SITE AS REDEVELOPMENT AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The BKK Corp. landfill, once one of the nation's busiest toxic dumps, may 
become a city redevelopment area under a plan being considered by municipal 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment officials since 1988 have been preparing an environmental impact 
report on potential development at the dump site, which may be transformed into 
a business park. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour public hearing on the report Monday, the City Council, 
acting jointly as the West Covina Redevelopment Agency, postponed action until 
June 25. The council and agency must approve the report before the property can 
be designated for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
The BKK site is the largest of eight potential redevelopment areas examined in 
the environmental report. When developed, the parcels, totaling 1,119 acres, 
could generate $1 million to $2 million annually in property taxes for West 
Covina, city Redevelopment Project Manager Matthew Fertal said. In exchange, 
the agency could offer property owners or developers financial help or other 
assistance in constructing improvements, such as sewers. 
</P>
<P>
All five residents who spoke at the joint hearing Monday voiced concerns about 
the proposed redevelopment designations. Action on the environmental report was 
postponed to give city employees the chance to respond to the criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers were troubled by the environmental legacy of the 583-acre BKK 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The firm ceased accepting hazardous waste in 1984, four months after 21 
families in nearby homes were ordered to evacuate because of a methane gas leak 
from the site. The landfill, which continues to accept 8,000 to 10,000 tons of 
non-hazardous trash daily, will shut down completely in five years, BKK 
President Ken Kazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to build a business park on parts of the property adjacent to the 
landfill in a joint venture with Newport Beach-based Davis Developments, he 
said. According to federal regulations, the land above and immediately 
surrounding the actual dump site must remain open space, he added. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director Pat Haley said preliminary plans submitted by the 
partnership show the 2.3-million-square-foot business park would sit on 233 
acres north and west of the landfill area. Retail use is being proposed for 
about 426,000 square feet of the complex, and the rest would be put to 
light-industrial use, such as research and development offices, she said. 
</P>
<P>
If his property is designated for redevelopment, Kazarian would be able to ask 
the city for financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand we will have project financing available that wouldn't otherwise 
be available," Kazarian said, adding that he is not yet sure whether he will 
request city help. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment designation is one way in which the city hopes to recoup 
revenue it will lose when BKK ceases operation as a dump. BKK has generated 
about $3 million for the city each year in business license taxes, city 
Accounting Manager Basil Panas said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also complained Monday that the BKK development would generate huge 
increases in traffic, especially along Azusa Avenue, the city's most congested 
corridor. They said the environmental report did not adequately explore ways to 
solve the potential traffic woes. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Steve Herfert agreed. "It's going to be a zoo down there," he said. 
Herfert added that he is concerned about the city's liability in paving the way 
for development near a former dump. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, resident Royall Brown, a director of the Upper San Gabriel Valley 
Municipal Water District, said the report did not detail the levels of 
contaminants in ground water at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Such data would be essential to any future buyer of the land. "Any buyer of any 
property of BKK ought to have (that information) available to them so they'll 
know what their liabilities are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services is conducting a series of studies on 
the landfill's environmental impact on the neighborhood, city Community 
Services Manager Mike Miller said. Reports on cancer occurrences and risks are 
to be released later this summer. A report analyzing birth abnormalities will

</P>
<P>
If approved, the other proposed redevelopment areas -- which include vacant 
lots, surplus school property and a few homes -- would be used to build 
residences, stores and offices.

CURBSIDE TRASH RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning in October, the city will collect recyclable materials from 90-gallon 
containers at residential curbsides. 
</P>
<P>
The collection plan was approved unanimously at Tuesday's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, which will be phased in across the city over a year, 
residents will not be required to sort recyclable materials. Plastics, glass, 
metals and paper will be stored in a single container that will be emptied by a 
truck twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
The city will contract with an undetermined facility to sort and sell the 
recyclable waste. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of Claremont residents already have refuse containers that can be 
picked up by a truck; they will be asked to use those containers for 
recyclables. Eventually 4,500 new containers for recyclables will be 
distributed at a cost to residents of $6.50 each. 
</P>
<P>
The collection system is expected to pay for itself when it is fully in place. 
A recycling fee of 90 cents will be added to monthly utility bills to cover the 
purchase of a second truck.

BERLIN WALL DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A free exhibition of nine original graffiti-covered segments of the Berlin Wall 
will be on display June 15 to July 4 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Tennessee 
Avenue Space, 11560 Tennessee Ave., West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the graffiti on the wall segments -- eight are 5-by-4 feet, the other 
is 13-by-4 feet -- is nonpolitical, except for English words like "freedom." 
</P>
<P>
The wall segments were acquired by West Berlin businessman Tobias Hausberg, who 
will be present during the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the wall segments, large-scale photographs of the wall by 
photographer Leland Rice, East Germany memorabilia and a videotape chronicling 
the history of the Berlin Wall since 1961 will also be on display. 
</P>
<P>
For more information call Raleigh Enterprises, which is sponsoring the 
exhibition along with Executive Life Insurance, at (213) 312-3600.

HEARING ON DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter will sponsor a public hearing to 
discuss ways to control development in the Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw and Leimert 
Park areas Wednesday at Audubon Junior High School, 4120 11th Ave. The hearing 
will begin at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the hearing is to increase public involvement in a proposal to 
write an Interim Plan Revision Ordinance for the area, one of the opening steps 
in revising the area's community plan. 
</P>
<P>
The community plan will set guidelines for the commercial, industrial and 
residential growth of an area. 
</P>
<P>
"The community plan revision process will give all the residents a voice in 
shaping the future of their community," Galanter said. "It's important that 
people make their voice heard by participating in the hearings and telling us 
what they think."

PARCEL TAX STILL UNDECIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With 387 more ballots counted since Election Day but an unknown number of 
absentee ballots uncounted, the fate of a tax that would benefit the Beverly 
Hills Unified School District remains up in the air, elections officials said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel tax measure, Proposition B on the June 5 municipal ballot, had 6,115 
yes votes, or 66.46% of the total so far, said Marcia Ventura, spokeswoman for 
the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
To take effect, the measure needs approval by two-thirds of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Votes against the tax numbered 3,086, or 33.53%, Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 75,000 ballots countywide yet to be counted, and it is unknown how 
many of those are from Beverly Hills, she said. More information on the results 
should be available today, she said.

WORK TO BEGIN ON SEALING SLUDGE AT SCHOOL GROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Park Avenue Elementary School, which has been closed for almost a year because 
its playground is contaminated with petroleum waste, is scheduled to reopen 
Oct. 5, Los Angeles school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Work is expected to start next month to cover the playground with a new layer 
of asphalt and a polyethylene liner to prevent the buried sludge of petroleum 
chemical compounds and its vapors from rising to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The work will cost an estimated $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The school, at 8020 Park Ave., was closed last July after parents and teachers 
raised concerns about health hazards associated with the tar-like sludge that 
appeared in tiny puddles on the surface of the asphalt playground. 
</P>
<P>
Tests by an environmental engineering firm concluded that students would not 
face any health hazards as long as they did not have prolonged contact with the 
sludge. The school was built on an old city dump. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 Park Avenue students are temporarily attending Teresa Hughes 
Elementary School and Clara Street Primary Center. Park Avenue operates on a 
year-round schedule.

COST OVERRUNS EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction costs for the new police building and jail could rise by another 
$500,000 over the $23.4 million already budgeted, the acting director of the 
city's Administrative Services Agency told the Board of Directors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
City officials plan to withhold $300,000 from contractors who they say failed 
to follow plans. 
</P>
<P>
Another $200,000 in expenses is being negotiated, acting Director Norman Carter 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
According to Carter's report, the overruns were because of faulty cost 
forecasting by city staff, poor architectural drawings, inadequate management 
by the first construction manager and division of the project into three phases 
with separate overseers, resulting in duplication. 
</P>
<P>
A $17-million bond issue for the police building was approved by voters in 
1986. The directors approved an additional $6.4 million last October.

COUNCIL PROTESTS PROJECT

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday approved a letter to the city of Los Angeles, 
outlining harmful impacts the proposed Playa Vista development near Marina del 
Rey could have on the city's air, noise level and traffic and other aspects of 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Summa Corp. is planning more than 10,000 apartments and condominiums, 520,000 
square feet of retail space, and almost 5 million square feet of office space 
on 957 acres between the Westchester Bluffs and Marina del Rey, according to 
the Los Angeles Department of City Planning. 
</P>
<P>
In its letter to the department, which is preparing an environmental impact 
report on Playa Vista, the council asked that the report include analyses on 
carbon monoxide concentrations from increased traffic, noise from traffic and 
heliports, sewage impact on the Hyperion Treatment Plant, and traffic 
congestion at 26 intersections in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the letter by a 4-0 vote, with Councilman Jim Boulgarides 
absent.

DOCK DEFICIENCIES DOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite recent complaints from several boat owners about shoddy maintenance of 
Marina del Rey docks, a survey has found deficiencies in the condition of only 
206 boat slips -- fewer than the previous inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the number of deficient slips was down 36% from a check 
last year, which identified maintenance problems with 326 slips. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 6,000 slips in the marina, the world's largest man-made 
small-craft harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The latest examination found maintenance problems at 19 locations in the 
marina, down slightly from 23 locations in the earlier survey. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of boat owners have told the county's Small Craft Harbor Commission 
in recent months that some docks are not being maintained properly and that 
boat owners who complain have been harassed in some cases.

$160.1-MILLION BUDGET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Manager John Jalili is proposing a $160.1-million city budget for the 
fiscal year beginning July 1, which is just under 1% less than last year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council held study sessions with department heads last week. 
</P>
<P>
The public will be able to comment on the proposed budget on June 26, when 
final council approval is expected. 
</P>
<P>
The general fund, from which most expenditures are made, is proposed for $85.2 
million, an increase of $6.1 million, or 7.7%, over last year. An additional 
$9.7 million in capital improvements -- mostly traffic related -- is also 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Among new expenditures proposed are $220,000 for a child-care center at Marine 
Park, a $150,000 increase in funding for nonprofit youth agencies, full-year 
funding for 12 additional police officers, which was only partly funded last 
year, and a new paramedic unit. 
</P>
<P>
The city maintains separate budgets for beach maintenance, transportation, 
airport, redevelopment, water and the pier.

$8.5-MILLION BUDGET OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted an $8.5-million budget for the 
1990-91 fiscal year, which will include park improvements, beefed-up law 
enforcement, additional staff members and a $2.7-million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
"This speaks quite well for the city's first year," Mayor Gary Werner said. 
"We've come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
The year-old city's finances received an extra boost earlier this year when the 
state Legislature passed a bill to give Diamond Bar $1.2 million in property 
taxes for the 1989-90 fiscal year. Previously, the city had been barred from 
collecting the money because of the timing of its incorporation in April, 1989.

A DAY IN THE PARK: VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK 13000 SAYRE ST., SYLMAR

Mary Dahlsten remembers the peaceful setting of the San Fernando Veterans 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to call it the 'country club of veterans hospitals,' " said 
Dahlsten, 73, who has lived half a mile from the 96-acre site of the hospital 
complex in Sylmar since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the patients would sit out on the lawn during the day and feed the 
squirrels." 
</P>
<P>
The peaceful setting was suddenly shattered on Feb. 9, 1971, at 6:01 a.m., when 
a 6.6 earthquake destroyed almost all of the buildings in the complex. 
Forty-nine patients, nurses and other hospital workers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Today, except for a memorial plaque embedded in a rock, there is no indication 
that this was once the site of a tragedy. The ruins of the hospital were long 
ago hauled away and much of the land re-landscaped and turned into Veterans 
Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
The park's most notable man-made feature is Century Gallery, a small art space 
in one of only two structures on the site to survive the earthquake. Hours of 
operation for the gallery, which features work by local artists, are severely 
restricted because of funding limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have a lot of programs but it's mostly just a park now," gallery 
curator Priscilla Nielsen said as she gazed out the window of her office. "I 
look at the trees and hills and grass and try to imagine what it was like when 
the hospital was here." DAVID COLKER

PANEL TO REVIEW HOUSE PLAN

<P>
A proposal to build 22 single-family homes on the western edge of Eaton Canyon 
will be reviewed by the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission within 
the next two months, said commission Clerk Betty Malcolm. 
</P>
<P>
A county hearing officer scheduled to consider the proposal Tuesday decided 
instead to send it to the commission because of the complex land issues 
involved, Malcolm said. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park developer Lao-Ko Chu seeks to construct 22 houses on a six-acre 
site north of New York Drive. Opponents say the site, a former stable, should 
remain undeveloped. They also contend the land is subject to flooding.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SIERRA MADRE;

<P>
EXTENDING BUILDING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council found itself caught in a deadline squeeze Tuesday when it 
discovered that a 45-day emergency moratorium on hillside construction expires 
June 22 unless the council meets the day before to extend it. 
</P>
<P>
But a problem exists. 
</P>
<P>
The extension requires four votes of the five-member body, and two of the 
council members will be out of town that Friday. To keep the moratorium in 
place, the council decided to meet at 8 a.m. June 25. 
</P>
<P>
Since City Hall is closed over the weekend, the council hopes that the 
early-morning passage of the extension will thwart developers who might take 
advantage of the moratorium's expiration. The council was unable to vote on an 
extension Tuesday because it had not met a 10-day notice requirement. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this year that a deadline on the hillside matter had 
caught the city unaware. On Jan. 4, the council held a special meeting after 
city officials discovered that a previous moratorium had expired and that a 
developer had applied for a subdivision permit. 
</P>
<P>
A city-appointed task force is working on a permanent ordinance.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: DOWNEY;

<P>
COMPROMISE WORKED OUT TO ALLOW PESTICIDE STORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Downey City Council on Tuesday gave final approval to a compromise 
agreement that will allow the county to store thousands of pounds of pesticides 
in a new warehouse near the southwest corner of Imperial Highway and Garfield 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors is expected to approve the agreement in coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The city would then drop its lawsuit against the county, which was filed last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Downey officials have opposed the county's plans to store 
pesticides at the facility, which is near residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Of special concern were plans to fumigate the stored squirrel bait -- 
poison-laden grain that can become infested with insects. Small amounts of 
poisonous gas are vented into the air after such fumigations. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, the county would fumigate only if the air-conditioning at 
the facility failed. Insects could breed in the grain if the temperature in the 
storage bin rises above the low-50s. 
</P>
<P>
The county plans to store nine pesticides at the facility, including 9,500 
pounds of squirrel bait.

DUARTE RESIGNS AS BOXING COACH OF ATHLETIC PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former world championship contender Frankie Duarte has resigned as head boxing 
coach of the Huntington Park Athletic Club, a city-sponsored boxing program to 
keep youths off the streets and out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly, who helped organize the club, said Duarte 
resigned last month to take care of personal business. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly said he hoped Duarte, 35, would return to the position soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really going to miss him," Connolly said. "He's made a great 
contribution and we want to get him back as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte, a former drug addict and alcoholic, had a relapse before he accepted 
the coaching job last year. Connolly said Duarte's resignation was not related 
to drug or alcohol abuse. Duarte could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte had his biggest victory in July, 1986, when he won the North American 
Boxing Federation bantamweight championship. It capped a comeback from drug and 
alcohol addiction that had derailed his career. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte had several championship fights but was never able to capture a major 
championship belt. He retired last August after losing a one-sided fight to 
Daniel Zaragoza for the World Boxing Council super-bantamweight title.

<P>
The City Council last week approved participation in the San Gabriel Valley 
Image Project, a joint public and private effort sponsored by the Synthesis 
Group, an Anaheim Hills consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a strong feeling that the San Gabriel Valley is quite lackluster and 
needs to be re-energized," Mayor Evelyn Fierro said. "It's basically been 
neglected by statewide leaders for many, many years."

BURNING OF LITTLE LEAGUER'S SHIRT FANS FIRE IN ANAHEIM

<P>
Little League manager Randy L. Pangborn lit a fire under his team Monday night, 
turning the pitcher's mound into a pyre by burning an opponent's jersey. His 
team won the game. But Pangborn might lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who witnessed the pregame blaze have complained to Little League 
officials, and the young pitcher who saw a duplicate of his jersey set afire 
was apparently so rattled he committed a run-scoring error that contributed to 
his team's first defeat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jackson, district administrator for 18 Little Leagues in Orange County, 
said Wednesday that officials will consider firing Pangborn, the manager of the 
Yankees and a member of the Anaheim Hills Little League board. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate the burning of a uniform. It is like burning the American 
flag," Jackson said. "There are 800 kids up there playing baseball, and we 
don't want this type of thing happening. If he is responsible for this, he 
won't be around." 
</P>
<P>
League representatives met Wednesday night at Imperial Elementary School to 
review the incident and consider whether to relieve Pangborn, who Jackson said 
was briefly suspended by the league two weeks ago for making rude remarks to an 
umpire. It was not determined if action would be taken against Pangborn's 
unidentified coach, who also participated in the fire incident. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Hills Little League board members and Pangborn, 38, who is also the 
league's director of fields, declined comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Pangborn) does so much work down there it's unbelievable," said Jim Head, 
a Pangborn supporter whose child is on a league team. "He's always getting 
people to contribute and getting people to donate materials." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the incident involving the jersey began about 5 p.m. Monday, 
half an hour before the Yankees and the undefeated A's -- teams made up of boys 
ages 10 to 12 -- took the field at Crescent Intermediate School on Gerda Drive. 
During warm-ups, Pangborn and his coach propped up a green and yellow A's 
jersey on the pitcher's mound with a stake. On the back was No. 17, the number 
of Todd Sterman, star hurler for the A's. 
</P>
<P>
With two players to block the wind, the Yankees' coach, encouraged by Pangborn, 
set the jersey on fire with a lighter, witnesses said. As it burned, Pangborn 
conducted infield practice, occasionally pausing to yell at Todd and to urge 
his own team on to victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd, did you see the number on the jersey?" witnesses quoted Pangborn as 
saying. "We are going to burn the A's down because the Yankees are fired up." 
</P>
<P>
Parents said the attempt to psyche out the opponents apparently worked; the A's 
lost 3 to 1. The Yankees scored all their runs in the first inning, some on 
errors, including a wild throw by Todd that sailed over the first baseman's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first inning was so upsetting," said Barbara Turner, whose son plays on 
the A's. "Our kids were so nervous. They're just little kids. Who knows if he 
will do this stunt again? Kids think it's OK because he is a role model. But it 
isn't." 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, shocked parents called league president Teresa Dean, concerned that 
Pangborn had set a poor example for impressionable boys. Dean then contacted 
the Anaheim Fire Department and the Orange Unified School District, which owns 
the field the league uses. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obviously poor judgment on his part, if he did this," said Mike Feeney, 
a fire and arson investigator for the Anaheim Fire Department. "My concern in 
this particular case is what kind of lasting impression did he leave, not only 
from an intimidation standpoint, but from a safety standpoint. What if another 
kid lights up a jersey and someone gets hurt or killed?" 
</P>
<P>
Feeney said there appears to be no violation of any arson laws, and proving 
that Pangborn set an illegal fire is difficult unless the suspect is caught 
red-handed by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Unified School District has the power to bar teams from the field if 
dangerous incidents continue. But A. Stanley Corey, the district's interim 
superintendent, said Crescent Intermediate officials have asked Anaheim Hills 
Little League to look into the matter and take appropriate action.

EAST VS. WEST: Are Florida beaches more uptight than California's? . . . This 
week Florida authorities banned from state beaches bathing suits that fail to 
cover the buttocks entirely. . . . Such suits are common here. One local 
company reports string bikini sales have jumped from 10% to 25% of the total 
since last year. . . . One concession: Laguna Beach's Margie Webb Swimwear 
makes suits that come with two bottoms -- one string and one three inches wide.

JUDGE ORDERS REFORMS AT O.C. JUVENILE HALL; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: SHE SAYS A PSYCHIATRIST MUST APPROVE USE OF PADDED ROOMS OR THE 
CUFFING OF TEEN-AGERS TO THEIR BEDS.

Calling for better treatment of youngsters confined at Orange County Juvenile 
Hall, a judge ordered the county Wednesday to obey strict new rules before 
throwing adolescent detainees into padded rooms or cuffing them to their beds. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Linda H. McLaughlin concluded that such disciplinary 
methods -- when imposed by unqualified people and conducted without proper 
supervision -- violates the teen-agers' constitutional right to be free from 
bodily restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights lawyers, who challenged the practices as cruel and "medieval," 
praised the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin ordered county officials to get approval from a psychiatrist before 
restraining minors in such ways and to closely monitor any such restriction. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the county-run facility claimed victory because the judge 
stopped short of outlawing use of the leather cuff restraints and rubber rooms, 
which they said are necessary to corral dangerous teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge's ruling is a vindication of our staff, who are firm but caring and 
concerned for the youngsters in their charge," said chief probation officer 
Michael Schumacher, who is in charge of all juvenile detention facilities in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
In a 49-page decision issued after a five-week civil rights trial, McLaughlin 
said that during 1989, only one out of every 200 youths confined in the hall 
were put into rubber rooms or tied to their beds. She acknowledged that such 
measures were generally used only when minors posed a danger to themselves or 
those around them by doing such things as threatening suicide, screaming and 
pounding the walls, smashing their fists through windows and putting their 
heads in toilets. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge also said that tying youths down or putting them in padded rooms 
also subjects them to potential psychological and physical injury. Testimony 
showed that teen-agers tied to their beds suffered numbness and swelling in 
their hands and feet, as well as cuts and nosebleeds. They also risk 
dehydration, nerve damage, circulatory problems and the possibility of choking 
on their own vomit, she said. The hard padding in rubber rooms will not protect 
a teen-ager from concussions and other injuries resulting from violent 
behavior, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Such risks call for the intervention of a psychiatrist, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
"The court is compelled to conclude that the (Juvenile Hall) staff is not 
trained or qualified to make the decision to tie down a minor or confine a 
minor to the rubber/safety room," McLaughlin wrote. "The only single individual 
who is adequately trained and qualified to exercise judgment which insures both 
the physical and psychological safety of the minor is a psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that in 1989, the California Youth Authority changed its policy and 
gave doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists sole decision-making power over 
when youths are tied down. The change resulted in far fewer restraint episodes, 
McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
In her order, McLaughlin said that if a psychiatrist's approval cannot be 
obtained and it is a "clear emergency," the decision to restrain a youth may be 
made by Juvenile Hall staff members, but only those who have been certified by 
a psychiatrist as trained and qualified to make such a call. 
</P>
<P>
Once an adolescent is in cuffs or a rubber room, a nurse must supervise and 
keep records of the incident, McLaughlin ordered. Within five days of the 
youth's release from restraints, a psychiatrist must review all records of the 
incident and submit a written assessment of the way it was handled, McLaughlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although McLaughlin noted that past procedures permitted restraint decisions to 
be made by inexperienced staffers only a few years older than the detainees, 
Kenneth S. Kasdan, a lawyer who represented the county, said that in reality 
only qualified supervisors make such decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We won on all the things that were most important," he said. "We need the use 
of rubber rooms and tie-downs to control a small number of minors who are out 
of control and dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher called the decision "a tremendous victory" that "reaffirms our 
longstanding belief that the policies and procedures (of Juvenile Hall) are 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Mark I. Soler, a lawyer with San Francisco's Youth Law Center, which 
represented the detainees in the class-action suit, said that he had hoped to 
eliminate use of tie-down restraints and rubber rooms but that the imposition 
of strict rules on their use is a "significant improvement" that protects the 
minors and sends an important message. 
</P>
<P>
"These procedures are demeaning and humiliating, and you can't have 20-year-old 
staffers with high school educations imposing them on kids," he said. "I think 
you'll see fewer kids being put in tie-downs willy-nilly at the unfettered 
discretion of the custodial staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, this decision is important because maybe now these kids will realize 
they do have some rights and that they can't be mistreated by the staff with 
impunity." 
</P>
<P>
Soler and the American Civil Liberties Union contended that Orange County is 
unusually harsh on its juvenile detainees and that most other counties use less 
severe forms of discipline and control. 
</P>
<P>
At a July 20 hearing, the judge will listen to the lawyers' objections to her 
decision. Changes in the ruling are possible but viewed as unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin's decision gave the civil rights lawyers one other victory: She 
agreed that Juvenile Hall's procedure restricting attorneys' access to 
detainees is unconstitutionally vague and must be rewritten. That procedure 
requires a lawyer who wishes to see a detainee to get permission from the 
youth's Juvenile Court-appointed attorney. 
</P>
<P>
But McLaughlin handed the plaintiffs a string of defeats on a host of more 
minor challenges to other Juvenile Hall practices. She said there was nothing 
unconstitutional about the way youths were sent to their rooms when they 
misbehaved or the kind of access they were given to legal materials on request. 
She also saw no problem with the reading and censoring of the youths' mail, the 
monitoring of their visits and phone calls, or the restrictions on the kinds of 
reading materials they were permitted to have. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin agreed that Juvenile Hall frequently exceeded its rated 314-person 
capacity, but she said that overcrowding did not rise to the level of a 
constitutional violation because the basic needs of the minors are still being 
met. The judge noted that an addition now under construction will add 60 beds 
in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs had also complained that youths are disciplined without adequate 
grievance or due-process procedures and that they are given insufficient access 
to toilets or outdoor exercise, but McLaughlin disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
The judge did, however, set a separate hearing to look into allegations that 
staff members harassed and intimidated youths who contested violations of their 
rights by participating in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the issues in the case were revised or abandoned in mid-trial. When 
proceedings began in April, the county had been using 10-foot strips of soft 
cloth to bind teen-agers to their bed frames. In response to criticism that the 
cloth ties cut off the youths' circulation, the county agreed to switch to 
fleece-lined leather restraints.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sonia Siguenza is on a life-support system at Western Medical Center in Santa 
Ana, complications from a blood disease steadily sapping her life. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctor says these surely are her final days. During the last month, as the 
25-year-old woman has lapsed in and out of a coma, she has told her husband, 
Israel, that she would like one last visit with her 9-year-old son, Walter, who 
has been living with her parents in her native El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
But young Walter Siguenza's final visit with his mother is mired in a tangle of 
immigration law and consular protocol. Officials have turned down requests for 
a special visa, saying they fear Walter, who was born in El Salvador, will 
remain with his parents and not return to his country, in defiance of 
immigration quotas. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of his wife's doctor and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), Israel 
Siguenza has spent the last few weeks appealing to officials of the U.S. 
Embassy in El Salvador, as well as to officials of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
But the answer is still no, and Siguenza grows more desperate as he feels his 
wife's life slipping away hastily like sand through an hourglass. 
</P>
<P>
"I am doing my best to grant her wishes," he said this week, his voice 
breaking. "She wants to see her son. And that's why I went to El Salvador and 
tried my best. But my best is not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
Siguenza, 28, a car salesman in Costa Mesa, has lived in Santa Ana for 10 
years. He and his wife have two children, Walter, 9, and a 21-month-old 
daughter whom he is caring for here. 
</P>
<P>
When doctors discovered last year that Sonia Siguenza was suffering from an 
infectious blood disease, she and Israel sent Walter to live with his 
grandparents in the Salvadoran town of Santa Ana. But now that doctors say she 
has very little time left, Sonia Siguenza wants to see her son one last time. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Siguenza took some of his savings and traveled to El Salvador to 
personally appeal to officials at the U.S. Embassy to grant his son a temporary 
visa. He hand-delivered a letter from his wife's doctor, Michael Fitzgibbons of 
Irvine, saying she does not have long to live. Also, at the request of 
Fitzgibbons, Sen. Wilson wrote a letter dated May 29 to State Department 
officials asking that the boy be granted a visa. 
</P>
<P>
But in their response to Wilson's letter, State Department officials said that 
"each person must demonstrate ties of such strength to his country of 
residence" that the agency is confident he will return. "Mr. Siguenza's 
inability to present such evidence (of strong ties) left the interviewing 
consular officer with no choice but to deny his application," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Adult applicants, for example, can show they have jobs or families to return to 
in their native countries, a spokesman explained. 
</P>
<P>
But "if the parents of the applicant are both in the U.S., then it's much 
harder to prove" that the boy would return to El Salvador, said Dave Denny, a 
spokesman for the State Department in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Siguenza, who has legal residency in the United States, said he tried to assure 
the officials that he would take his son back to El Salvador after a week's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'I will give you my green card right now and you can restrict me 
if I don't bring him back.' I'm even willing to lose my residency here," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to do anything to make her wishes come through," he said. "The 
doctors and the others know that. I pray to God, and sometimes I think that not 
even God is listening to me." 
</P>
<P>
Franz Wisner, Wilson's deputy press secretary in Washington, said that they 
only received a copy of the State Department response on Tuesday but that his 
office will continue to see if it can help Siguenza. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the senator is able to pinpoint what problem the State Department has with 
the visa application, he can act as a middleman to try to get some of that 
resolved so that Walter can come here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgibbons, Sonia Siguenza's doctor, described his patient as "a very gentle, 
self-effacing and committed mother who has rarely thought about herself." 
</P>
<P>
"Her main thoughts are always about her children," he said. "She is afraid of 
the tragedy that is going to befall the family once she is gone. She is worried 
about how she can arrange for her family's needs to be met." 
</P>
<P>
He said he also is frustrated that Walter is not being allowed to come visit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unlikely that El Salvador will allow her remains to return," Fitzgibbons 
said. "So not only can Walter not see his mother alive, but he probably also 
cannot even see his mother's grave, which to me is totally inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the reason she was staying alive, only to see her son," he said.

MAN DIES IN TRYING TO CROSS FREEWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol is trying to identify a man who was struck by 
several vehicles and killed Wednesday morning while trying to cross the 
southbound San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The man was the second in two days to die in attempting to cross the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Angel Johnson said investigators discovered the body after 
receiving a call from a motorist who said he might have struck the victim. 
</P>
<P>
The accident happened about 2:15 a.m. south of Fairview Road. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the victim had pulled his 1980 Dodge pickup to the right shoulder 
for an unknown reason and was struck when he apparently ran across the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no (identification) . . . nothing in his pocket except for the keys to 
his truck," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who may have seen the accident is urged to call CHP Officer Mike Richard 
at (714) 547-8311. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Juan Carlos Sotelo, 19, of Fullerton, was killed while trying to 
cross the freeway in San Clemente. MATT LAIT

RULING ON COAST STRIP BACKS PARK DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge ruled this week that a 1.5-mile coastal strip that includes posh 
Monarch Bay belongs within the boundaries of the Capistrano Bay Park and 
Recreation District, not neighboring Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Superior Court Judge James Smith means the park district will 
continue to receive the approximately $1 million in annual property tax revenue 
from the area -- about half of the district's $2-million operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling settled a portion of a long-running battle between Dana Point and 
Laguna Niguel over control of the approximately 850-acre coastal area. The 
judge upheld the reorganization of the 25-year-old park district to include the 
coastal strip, a move that was approved by the Local Agency Formation 
Commission in October of 1988 and then challenged by the Laguna Niguel 
Community Service District. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider this a major obstacle being hurdled for us," said David A. Lewis, 
park district administrator. "Obviously, the revenue is very substantial for 
our district." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began when the then-proposed city of Dana Point enlarged its 
boundaries to include the coastal area. Following that action, the directors of 
the park district voted in July, 1988, to annex the same coastal strip and make 
its district boundaries contiguous with those of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"It just made everything cleaner for the agencies involved," Lewis said of the 
boundary change. "Otherwise, you would have had a municipality, Dana Point, 
with 99% of its parks controlled by one agency, ours, and with 1% controlled by 
another, Laguna Niguel." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Laguna Niguel's district challenged LAFCO's decisions on both the 
city's and the park district's annexations, claiming more analysis should have 
been performed and an environmental impact report submitted. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel City Councilman Paul M. Christiansen criticized the decision but 
stopped short of saying the city would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The annexation took several hundred thousand (dollars) of our tax revenues, 
without a vote of the people, and gave it away," Christiansen said. "We will 
pursue this to the maximum to get that money back to the city of Laguna 
Niguel." LEN HALL

HIGH-SPEED TRAIN NEEDS PUBLIC LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Bechtel Corp. official conceded Wednesday that the company's proposed 
magnetically levitated, 300-m.p.h. train from Anaheim to Las Vegas cannot be 
financed and built privately as planned without the donation of publicly owned 
rights of way along Interstate 15 in the California and Nevada deserts. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 100 business executives and engineering experts at a 
luncheon meeting of the Industrial League of Orange County in Costa Mesa, 
Bechtel Senior Vice President Erv Koenig also said his firm will not do 
independent ridership feasibility studies -- a key to obtaining financial 
backing -- unless Bechtel is awarded an exclusive franchise from the bistate 
panel studying the project. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig said Bechtel has already committed more than $3 million of its own money 
to project preparation and won't spend millions more on additional studies 
until it knows the money will be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of business economics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the only ridership projections have come from a 1989 Canadian 
Institute of Ground Transport study financed by the city of Las Vegas, which 
originated the high-speed train proposal. The study projected ridership levels 
exceeding 5 million passengers annually by the year 2000. Although some experts 
have strong doubts about the study's estimates, Koenig said he believes they 
are too conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the cost of rights of way, Koenig said after the luncheon that 
California, Nevada and federal officials are anxious to donate a 50-foot-wide 
swath of land adjacent to Interstate 15 but that they must await congressional 
action since current law forbids private use of federal highway land. 
</P>
<P>
The train "simply can't make a profit without that land," Koenig said. "If the 
bill fails to pass for some reason, then this won't be a private project." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Bechtel is one of three firms expected to file formal bids 
for the project by the July 16 deadline with the California-Nevada Super Speed 
Ground Transportation Commission, created two years ago to plan and award an 
exclusive franchise. The final award, expected in September, must be ratified 
by the legislatures of both states. 
</P>
<P>
The other two firms are Montreal-based Bombardier and Boise-based 
Morrison-Knudsen. Both are expected to propose French high-speed train 
technology, which employs steel wheels on steel tracks but at faster speeds 
than conventional trains. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel has teamed with the West German Transrapid group, which has developed 
the mag-lev train at a test track near Emsland. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

COUNCIL PREPARES FOR DEVELOPMENT VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council took action this week to clear the way for a final vote July 
17 on a controversial residential and commercial development proposed for the 
former Santiago Creek Golf Course and nearby creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 to speed the review of final data on the development 
plan and hire a consultant to review traffic studies of the area before the 
July 17 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 150 residents at the meeting favored a longer period of study for 
one part of the development, a proposal to delete the extension of La Veta 
Street from Cambridge Street to Tustin Avenue. Many of those who oppose the 
speedy review sported bright yellow badges that identified them as members of 
the Santiago Creek Greenway Alliance, a coalition of homeowners and 
environmentalists who want to preserve the creek as open space. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen William Steiner and Gene Beyer sided with those residents, saying 
that one month was not enough time to study the impact of dropping the La Veta 
extension. But the council majority decided that after four years of arguing 
over the fate of the 37-acre site, a final decision on the development should 
not be postponed again. 
</P>
<P>
On July 17, the council will vote on a general plan amendment to delete the La 
Veta extension and consider environmental reports on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The development, Villa Santiago, would call for filling in the creek bed in 
order to build 160 single-family homes, a seven-acre shopping plaza and a 
3.5-acre greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
However, both supporters and opponents of the project expressed relief that 
after more than four years battling for control of the 37-acre site, a final 
decision could be made as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
The developer of the project, Lynn Burnett, said he is optimistic that the plan 
will be approved next month. In the last two years, Burnett said the project 
that started as a 471-unit apartment complex has undergone four revisions and 
slowly gained support from the community. 
</P>
<P>
"To me the real story here is not that 100 people show up with banners and 
flags," Burnett said of the crowd Tuesday. "To me the story is that a couple 
years ago, 350 people showed up and were very vocal and very hostile" toward 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the project have said that filling in Santiago Creek would destroy 
one of the few greenbelts left in the city and eliminate an important flood 
wash, creating a hazard in heavy rains. MARY HELEN BERG

CHARGE REDUCED IN INJURY OF STORE CLERK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing lack of evidence, prosecutors reduced a charge of attempted murder to 
assault and battery against a Marine Corps recruiter accused of attacking a 
supermarket clerk after an argument. 
</P>
<P>
"After receiving additional reports and further investigation, we don't believe 
we can prove an actual intent to kill," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
James W. Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Juan Rodriguez, 29, of Irvine, a former boxer, is accused of assaulting 
Larry Lamar Hatch, 22, of Garden Grove, during a confrontation in the parking 
lot of an Albertson's supermarket in Anaheim on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez now faces charges of assault with a deadly weapon and battery in 
North Orange County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Rodriguez was arguing with Hatch and several other workers in the 
store parking lot when the fight broke out, leaving Hatch unconscious after 
Rodriguez allegedly hit him twice. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was confined to the Marine base in El Toro following the incident, 
which left Hatch in a coma. Hatch has since regained consciousness and is 
listed in fair condition at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks said he does not expect the reduced charges to alter the court order 
confining Rodriguez to the base. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's attorney, Dennis O'Connell, who has contended that his client was 
acting in self-defense, said Wednesday that the case proceeded before all the 
evidence could be collected. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a factual basis for the charge of attempted murder," he said.

CAT LOVER DIGS IN FOR DOGFIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dorothy Diggins is ready to let the fur fly. 
</P>
<P>
A 59-year-old resident of Leisure World in Seal Beach, Diggins is ready to take 
on the management and do battle for the right to keep her cat, Tippy. Leisure 
World is trying to make her get rid of her fluffy companion, citing a policy 
prohibiting cats and dogs in the sprawling complex. 
</P>
<P>
As she digs in her heels, Diggins has become an unlikely heroine for dozens of 
elderly residents she says are quietly keeping cats for company, despite the 
rules. She also finds herself the target of angry phone calls from others who 
helped enact the no-quadrupeds rule (birds and fish are permitted) and want to 
see it enforced, Diggins said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think my kitty-cat and I infringe on anyone's rights," Diggins said. 
"She's quiet and never goes outside. I don't want to bother anyone, but I don't 
think we do." 
</P>
<P>
Diggins has had Tippy for six years without any problem. She contends the 
no-cats-and-dogs policy has been benignly ignored and unenforced for years, and 
she doesn't understand why it's being enforced against her now, since 
management has known about Tippy for at least two years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
William A. Williams, an attorney for the Golden Rain Foundation, which operates 
Leisure World, said the rule was enacted by the residents themselves and has 
always been enforced. Diggins is not being singled out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any instance in which it hasn't been enforced when we've found 
out about someone keeping a cat or dog," he said. "Each time it's come up, it's 
been taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Williams would not specify how such disputes have been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Sontag, a Newport Beach lawyer who represented another cat owner in 
Leisure World several years ago, said he got management to drop its move 
against her by arguing that it had known about her cat for years and done 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Diggins has been discussing her predicament with Sontag. 
</P>
<P>
Sontag said Leisure World should fall under the rules of the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development because HUD insures its mortgages. That agency 
permits pets for the elderly and handicapped who live under its jurisdiction, 
he said. But Sontag said Williams has stated that he believes Leisure World is 
exempt from HUD regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Diggins says she will do what she can to keep her home and her cat. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a great pair," she said. "We need each other." CATHERINE GEWERTZ

PEOPLE: OUT OF SORTS? TAKE A LESSON FROM A BERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You get a lesson in life and love when Sharon Kay Alexander discusses 
strawberries, her favorite subject. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to first whet the appetites of people by telling them that 
strawberries have to be nurtured with care and love to get their sweetness," 
said the Santa Ana resident who is also known as the Strawberry Lady. "And so 
do their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Author of a recipe book called "The Strawberry Patch," she talks to community 
organizations about patience, kindness and love in growing strawberries. "Good 
fruit doesn't just happen," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"And the same is true with life," she tells them. "You have to cultivate and 
nurture those qualities." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander likes to compare people to strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
"Strawberry historians say that the original strawberry had a petal dislodged, 
which caused it to draw itself in and become less attractive on the bottom, but 
it still remained flavorful," she said.

"That's like a lot of people who have had a petal knocked off. They have to 
make a choice. Do they go ahead or pull in? Are they positive or bitter? I've 
learned a lot about people because of strawberries." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, born in South Dakota and raised by her grandparents after her mother 
died, said she always seemed be around strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandparents had a strawberry patch right at the back door, and it was our 
favorite fruit," she said. "We also did a lot of farming and had pigs and 
chickens. I'm a country girl." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving home, Alexander started collecting recipes for strawberries and 
putting them in the book published eight years ago. She said 60,000 copies have 
been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more flamboyant strawberry recipes include Strawberry Flambe and 
Strawberry Romanoff. The book contains strawberry soda and soup recipes, 
information on how to preserve and freeze strawberries and how to start a 
strawberry patch. 
</P>
<P>
One recipe tells how to make berry butter. 
</P>
<P>
Her particular favorite is one called "Want a Little Strawberry Cheesecake, 
Honey?" 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite is her edible table centerpiece with kale and chocolate-dipped 
strawberries attached with toothpicks. Flowers are placed at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"My (four) kids said I brainwashed them into thinking that strawberries are 
God's favorite fruit," said Alexander, 48, vice president of Priority Living, a 
Tustin-based nonprofit educational and consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander also makes other culinary delights. And while she prefers 
strawberries, she wrote another recipe book called All American Apple Cookbook, 
which also has sold 60,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
"When people ask me to bring a dish to an event and I don't take something with 
strawberries in it, they're disappointed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the Orange County Fair on July 14 at 3 p.m. will hear and see her 
educational strawberry cooking demonstration in the Crafts and Cooks Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The fair is aptly themed "Very Berry Extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Besides concocting various colorful strawberry delights, she will discuss the 
history of the seasonal berry and emphasize its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are weight-conscious will be especially interested to know that 
strawberries have the highest Vitamin C content of any fruit and only have 50 
calories in a cup," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Madding has an insatiable desire to see the world -- all of it. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he's traveled to 95 countries and in August will visit Madagascar to 
make it 96. In February, he was in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The Buena Park resident, property tax manager for Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson in 
Fullerton, said his goal is to visit 100 countries to join the Traveler's 
Century Club, a group of people who have documented travel to 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't have a favorite country, but he leans toward Papua New Guinea. "It's 
the most exotic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His next goal? "I understand there are 308 independent countries and island 
groups in the world, and I'd like to visit them all."

ABOVE THE STORM, FLAG FLIES HIGH

Flag Day was always supposed to be a time to honor Old Glory, but with the 
Stars and Stripes at the center of a political firestorm, the banner itself has 
become a symbol of an intense national debate. 
</P>
<P>
And with the Supreme Court ruling that Congress cannot make it a crime to burn 
the flag, defenders are rallying this Flag Day to protect their beloved 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's disgusting," said Ed Kearns, commander of the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars post in Mission Viejo. "I'm a patriot, and I've seen my buddies 
die for this flag. I think the Bill of Rights should be defended. Desecrating 
the flag is not a right, it's a disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
At Mission Viejo and at other VFW posts and offices of the Elks Lodge and the 
American Legion, ceremonies are being held to celebrate Flag Day, which 
officially is today. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns said many veterans were emotional during ceremonies that were held at 
the post Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of patriotism shown," Kearns said. "We had almost 200 people 
there singing the National Anthem and a few shed tears were shared." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Tallmon, a member of the Garden Grove VFW post, also spoke out against 
the Supreme Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought three wars because of that damned flag and I kind of like it," 
Tallmon said. "On Flag Day, I'll be flying my flag in my front yard, that's for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Buena Parks Elks Lodge held a Flag Day ceremony Wednesday 
evening and said Flag Day means more now than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more significance this year, a more acute awareness of our flag," said 
Joe Kronsteiner, a Leading Knight in the club. "There's a lot of talk in the 
lodge and people don't like the Supreme Court ruling at all. They're not 
screaming fanatics about it, but they do support a constitutional amendment 
against flag burning. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally feel very bad about those flag-burning incidents and the court 
ruling. Our flag is our national emblem, something to rally around, and I think 
people should pay more respect to it. It's not there to be maligned." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Elks Lodge in Orange said they have "taken a definite stand" 
against flag burning and reiterated their feeling during a ceremony held 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our members feel the American flag is a sacred emblem and should be 
treated as such," said Dick Arend, exalted ruler of the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
David Moulton, commander of the American Legion post in Orange, said his 
organization was also "burned up" over the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a serviceman, you're there to defend the flag," Moulton said. "To have 
people who want to abuse it, that just seems wrong to me. The only time a flag 
should be burned is at an authorized disposal ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
Patriotic service organizations aren't the only ones formally celebrating Flag 
Day this week. Several schools will also be paying tribute to the American 
flag. One such ceremony will take place today at Montevideo Elementary School 
in Mission Viejo at 9:30 a.m.

BUILDER DROPS FOOTHILLS HOUSING PLAN

A Newport Beach home builder has suddenly dropped plans to build what would 
have been the largest single housing development in the sensitive South County 
foothills below the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Costain Homes Inc. has dropped plans to build 294 houses in the environmentally 
sensitive foothills. 
</P>
<P>
Costain Homes held an option to purchase 444 acres in the foothills adjacent to 
Trabuco Canyon. The project had already been submitted to the county for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It was strictly a business decision not to renew the option," said Steve Ford, 
a vice president in charge of planning and acquisition for Costain. "There were 
a lot of factors involved in the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco resident Bruce Conn said he was happy that Costain was out of the 
picture because the firm's other developments in Riverside County were 
tract-style houses, a type that Conn believes would not fit into the rural 
setting in Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Couch, who handled the project at Costain Homes, has left the Newport Beach 
company and still is assisting the Ferber Family Trust that owns the parcel in 
the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Couch said he is working with the Irvine firm of Patterson, White and Gross to 
develop a new building plan with 100 fewer houses that would "balance the 
intensity (of the development) with the capacity of the local existing traffic 
circulation." 
</P>
<P>
He said the plan would call for less grading and fewer homes, and would 
preserve more than 90% of the area's oak trees and use existing roads to move 
traffic from the canyons and foothills to the nearby proposed Foothill 
Transportation Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"The Costain proposal was not a good one," said conservationist Ray Chandos, a 
Trabuco Canyon homeowner and chairman of an 11-member advisory panel of canyon 
residents and major landowners. The panel has spent two years reviewing 
development options for the area. But, Chandos said, the county will "never buy 
off" on the new proposal because of its failure to deal with the increased 
traffic that the project would create. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its abundance of oaks and scenic rural roads, the Trabuco Canyon 
area has been the focus of debate between pro-growth forces and 
environmentalists who say the area is the last of its kind in Orange County and 
should be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
County planners are working on a plan to control growth in Trabuco Canyon and 
nearby foothills.

ORPHANAGES FOSTER STABILITY, FORMER JUDGE SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Retired Philadelphia Judge Lois G. Forer, continuing her plea to "bring back 
the orphanage," Wednesday challenged Orange County professionals who work with 
abused and abandoned children to rethink the way they view long-term child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"We are failing our children," she said. "We are abandoning millions of the 
next generation. We are permitting hundreds of children to die preventable 
deaths as a result of abuse and neglect." 
</P>
<P>
Forer said adoption and foster parenting have failed as means of caring for and 
providing stable environments for abandoned children. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all heard President Bush talk about the joys of adoption," she said. 
"But where are we going to find the adoptive parents to take the kids?" 
</P>
<P>
Forer made her comments at the 24th annual meeting of the Florence Crittendon 
Services of Orange County at the Radisson Hotel in Irvine. The Crittendon 
program, based in Fullerton, provides residential care for troubled adolescent 
girls and abused and neglected infants. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Salzman, Crittendon office manager, agreed with Forer's assessment, 
noting that problems often arise when abused children are taken from their 
parents but eventually reunited. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make long-term placement situations available so they are not being 
bumped back and forth," Salzman said. 
</P>
<P>
Salzman said that of the 165 adolescent girls helped by her agency last year, 
the average number of previous stays in group homes was four. Six of the girls 
had been put in 20 homes before arriving at Crittendon, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids between 12 and 18 years of age. That's really serious," Salzman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But William Steiner, executive director of Orangewood Children's Foundation, 
disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought of going back to the orphanage for me is unacceptable," he said. 
"There are institutions today that are very abusive and have poorly trained and 
poorly paid staffs." 
</P>
<P>
Steiner reminded the audience of abuses involving orphans years ago -- in some 
cases children were actually sold to families who put them to work -- and noted 
that other methods such as foster parenting are more suited to the needs of 
today's children. Steiner is a foster parent to a 22-month-old drug-addicted 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner said his experience as a fund-raiser for Orangewood Children's Home 
tells him that it would be impossible to raise enough money to support a 
well-run system of orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
Forer gained national attention for an article she wrote in 1988 entitled 
"Bring Back the Orphanage." In that piece, she said that during her time on the 
Court of Common Pleas bench in Philadelphia she saw thousands of abused and 
neglected children in need of "safe and permanent homes" who were eventually 
reunited with abusive parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Again and again, I saw children placed in a series of inadequate foster homes 
because there was no place else for them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Orphanages or "group homes," she said, would provide these children with a 
stable environment and save them from being shuttled among foster homes.

COUNTY DECATHLETES FINISH THIRD, FOURTH

Orange County decathletes Sheldon Blockburger and Jay Thorson finished third 
and fourth, respectively, at USA/Mobil Track and Field Championships Wednesday 
night at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
The top four finishers in the decathlon qualified to represent the United 
States at the Goodwill Games next month in Seattle, making Blockburger and 
Thorson understandably ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real happy. It's the happiest day of my track career," said Blockburger, 
25, a former track and field standout at Newport Harbor High School, Orange 
Coast College and Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
Blockburger, who lives and trains in Eugene, Ore., scored 8,301 points, an 
impressive improvement over his previous best, 8,248, which he totaled in 
placing second in this competition last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I got personal records in the pole vault, discus and long jump," Blockburger 
said. "I have no complaints about any events." 
</P>
<P>
Thorson, who competed at Laguna Beach High and Stanford, improved his previous 
best of 7,946 points by 300 points to finish with 8,246. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson, the defending champion and American-record holder, won with 
8,600. Dan O'Brien was second with 8,483. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's half of the 10-event competition, Blockburger had 4,359 points 
-- tying him for second with Johnson -- and Thorson was in sixth place with 
4,137. 
</P>
<P>
Blockburger and Thorson were especially impressive considering they have had to 
deal with setbacks in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Blockburger, who won the state community college decathlon for Orange Coast in 
1985, suffered an adductor strain last year that kept him from training through 
most of last fall and winter. He started training again in mid-March, but 
worked only on the basics, such as starts, holding off on the more technical 
events such as the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of practice certainly did not show Wednesday as Blockburger bettered 
his personal best of 15 feet 9 inches in the event with a leap of 16-0. 
</P>
<P>
Blockburger also had set personal records in the discus (141-10) and long jump 
(25-9 1/4w), which were contested Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thorson, who has competed in the decathlon for nine years, finally reached the 
heyday he has been seeking for many years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time coming," said Thorson, 27, who lives in Laguna Beach and 
trains at UC Irvine. "I've been training with Daley Thompson (world-record 
holder and two-time Olympic champion) for two to three months out of the year. 
Obviously training with someone who's done those things is inspiring." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Thorson hit a low in his athletic career. After finishing seventh 
in the U.S. Olympic trials in 1988, he spent most of 1989 living and training 
in Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"I trained with a track club there in a stadium built by Napoleon," Thorson 
said. "But I trained half-heartedly, just to keep the cobwebs out. I did some 
modeling for money." 
</P>
<P>
Thorson returned to the United States seven weeks before The Athletics Congress 
championships at Houston. He finished ninth with 7,722 points. After the meet 
he contracted viral meningitis. "I got it from a mosquito bite in Houston," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Blockburger and Thorson agreed that making the Goodwill Games team was one of 
the top accomplishments of their career. 
</P>
<P>
"To make the Goodwill team is fantastic," Thorson said. "I was planning on 
breaking (8,000 points). In April, I wrote down my goals and I came up with 
8,281. That's what I thought would be feasible. I wrote it down, circled it, 
dated it and put '1990 TAC Nationals,' by it. And then I put a big 'YES!' under 
it."

The California Angels drafted 53 players, including four from Orange County, in 
last week's free agent amateur baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels selected center fielder Garret Anderson of Kennedy High School, 
right-handed pitcher Todd Blyleven of Villa Park, catcher Eric Buechele from 
Fullerton who played for Fresno State and right-handed pitcher Jay Hassel of 
Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,487 players were selected in a record 101 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Astros led all teams with 100 selections, surpassing their own 
record of 88, set last year. Seattle was second with 75 selections, followed by 
the New York Yankees (74), Montreal (71) and Atlanta (67). 
</P>
<P>
There were 587 players selected from four-year colleges, 577 from high schools, 
317 from junior colleges and six listed as being chosen from other categories. 
</P>
<P>
Right-handed pitchers made up the largest single group of draftees (464), 
followed by outfielders (315) and infielders, excluding first basemen (289). 
</P>
<P>
Those attending schools in California made up the largest group (349), followed 
by 142 from Florida and 116 in Texas. Five states -- Alaska, Delaware, Montana, 
South Dakota and Vermont -- had no players taken. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, 1,488 players were drafted in 88 rounds, both records at the time.

CORE OF KANSAS CITY'S LINEUP FINALLY MAKES A BREAKTHROUGH; 
</P>
<P>
ROYALS: TARTABULL AND BRETT END THEIR SLUMPS, COMBINING FOR FIVE OF THE TEAM'S 
19 HITS WEDNESDAY.

<P>
George Brett looked up at one of the people who has watched the Kansas City 
Royals play all season. 
</P>
<P>
He got the answer he expected -- a shake of the head. This was the first time 
the Royals had scored as many as 11 runs in a game, and the first time they had 
collected 19 hits. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first real laugher," Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
It came at the expense of the Angels, who were beaten Wednesday, 11-4, stopping 
the Royals' eight-game losing streak in the series final at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals' trouble began early this season. 
</P>
<P>
Before the second game of the season, Danny Tartabull was shagging flies in the 
outfield, and life was good. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals had lost their opener to Baltimore, but no matter. Tartabull had 
gone two for five with a home run, and the Royals were picked to contend in the 
American League West. 
</P>
<P>
But as Tartabull jogged in, he felt something pop, as if a ball had hit him in 
the leg. Instead, he had injured a small muscle near the calf. The injury put 
him on the disabled list and he missed the next 32 games. 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull's injury was just one of the things that contributed to the Royals' 
unexpected struggles. But it was one that struck at the core of the Royal 
batting order. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's offense has been weak where it should have been strongest. 
</P>
<P>
Brett, a career .310 hitter who was slated to bat third at the outset, was 
batting .254 with one home run before Wednesday's game. Tartabull, who was 
supposed to bat fourth, was batting .200 with four home runs, thanks to a 
six-game hitting streak that coincided with six consecutive starts, his longest 
uninterrupted starting stretch of the season. Bo Jackson, set to bat fifth, was 
hitting .269 with six home runs and a team-high 70 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Those three were supposed to supply the runs -- and the home runs -- for the 
Royals. Instead, the three had a total of 11 homers on a team that is last in 
the league in that category. 
</P>
<P>
Manager John Wathan has puzzled over the Royals' offense again and again. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a slump like this, for this long, with the talent we have," he 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the frustration fell away Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull singled three times in five at-bats, scoring twice, and raising his 
batting average 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
"He was swinging the bat pretty well tonight," Wathan said. "He's a big part of 
our offense and it's very important for him to be in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven games, Tartabull has gone 11 for 27 with two doubles and 
two homers. 
</P>
<P>
He is still a far cry from his form of 1987, when he hit .309, with 34 home 
runs and 101 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
This season has proven more frustrating than last, when a series of groin and 
hamstring problems limited Tartabull to 133 games. He finished with a .268 
average and career lows in home runs (18) and RBIs (62). 
</P>
<P>
Brett went two for four Wednesday night, driving in a run. His average rose to 
.258. Jackson went one for four, striking out twice. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's game was the Royals' biggest offensive performance of the year, and 
if felt good. But they are not happy to have an off day Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals open a series at home against Minnesota on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time something like this happens, we have an off day the next day, and 
by the time you come to the ballpark 48 hours later, the thrill is gone," Brett 
said. "The best thing would be to have a day game the next day so it's fresh in 
your mind."

UNLV ATHLETIC DIRECTOR TO RESIGN DEC. 31; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: ROTHERMEL'S 'UNEXPECTED' MOVE IS NOT LIKELY TO INFLUENCE THE NCAA'S 
INVESTIGATION OF BASKETBALL PROGRAM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Rothermel, the athletic director who has guided the Nevada Las Vegas 
program for the past 10 years, has announced his resignation, effective Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt it was time for someone else to drive us into the year 2000," 
Rothermel said at a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He will return to teaching as a professor in the UNLV School of Health, 
Physical Education and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Rothermel said a major goal had been to head a program involving a national 
champion. That goal was accomplished April 2, when the Runnin' Rebels won the 
NCAA basketball championship at Denver, defeating Duke in a lopsided title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Rothermel said he decided Feb. 17 to leave the post, but withheld an 
announcement because he wanted to mull over the decision. 
</P>
<P>
His announcement came as UNLV awaits word on the results of an NCAA 
investigation into the school's basketball program; the results are expected 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Haney, commissioner of the Big West Conference, called Rothermel's 
resignation "unexpected" but said he did not anticipate that it would have any 
effect on the NCAA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the fact that there's been a change at the athletic director's 
level will change their approach significantly, but I'm just guessing," Haney 
said. "I think that because of the fact that he's planning to stay there and 
remain in the same position until the end of year, there probably will not be 
much impact." 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the Big West Conference, among them Cal State Fullerton 
and UC Irvine, are affected greatly by UNLV's fortunes because of the national 
prominence and television revenue the Runnin' Rebel basketball program has 
brought to the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Rothermel and University President Robert Maxson addressed questions about the 
possibility of UNLV leaving the conference, saying that becoming an independent 
is not a viable option. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't rule out any different league alignments," Maxson said. "I am very 
mindful we're very important to the Big West Conference and the Big West 
Conference is important to us." 
</P>
<P>
Haney praised Rothermel for maintaining balance between the interests of UNLV 
and the interests of the conference during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad is highly respected among the conference directors and presidents," Haney 
said. "He is held in very high regard." 
</P>
<P>
Rothermel said that when he came to UNLV, the university had a $250,000 deficit 
in its athletic program. He said the program has operated in the black every 
year since then, finishing last year with a $1.5 million surplus. He said this 
year's surplus will be even larger because of revenue from the Rebels' NCAA 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Rothermel headed the latest attempt to boost the school's football program to 
national prominence, hiring Notre Dame assistant Jim Strong in December to 
replace Wayne Nunnely, who was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Maxson praised Rothermel's work and said he talked him out of taking an 
athletic director's job at another major school three years ago.

STATE WON'T SUE ACCOUNTANTS WHO AUDITED LINCOLN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state agency that regulates accountants decided Wednesday that it would not 
sue any of the three accounting firms that performed audits or worked on the 
financial statements of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and its bankrupt 
parent company, American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the 12-member State Board of Accountancy voted unanimously in a 
closed-door session to continue with its ongoing investigation to determine if 
any disciplinary action should be taken against California-licensed accountants 
in the scandal, according to Jack Kazanjian, a Fresno accountant and board 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The board, during a special meeting on the Lincoln matter, decided not to 
pursue civil litigation now because there is "far too much information" yet to 
be learned, Kazanjian said. 
</P>
<P>
The board has authority to discipline licensed accountants and to sue 
accountants and accounting firms for violations of state business laws that 
prohibit false and misleading statements. About 23,000 large and small 
investors in American Continental debt securities -- as well as a host of state 
and federal agencies and politicians -- relied, in part, on financial audits 
and other statements by the accounting firms about the health of American 
Continental. 
</P>
<P>
The primary accounting firm targeted by investors in pending litigation is the 
former Arthur Young &amp; Co., now called Ernst &amp; Young. Other defendants 
are Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and the former Touche, Ross &amp; Co., now 
Deloitte &amp; Touche. 
</P>
<P>
The investors now hold about $250 million in worthless securities after the 
company filed for bankruptcy on April 13, 1989. The following day, regulators 
seized Lincoln. The S&amp;L is expected to become one of the nation's biggest 
thrift-repair jobs, costing taxpayers at least $2 billion.

UTI BREAKS MOLD WITH NEW SKI-BOOT FORMULA 
</P>

When kid scientists dream, they dream of places like UTI Chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine company's primary business is combining chemicals and patented 
"secret formulations" to come up with nifty new products. Products like airless 
automobile tires that are supposed to never go flat. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, UTI unveiled its latest idea -- a newfangled way of manufacturing 
ski boots. The company said it has signed a research agreement with Nordica 
U.S.A., the world's largest ski boot maker, to develop a chemical molding 
method for producing ski boots. 
</P>
<P>
UTI Chairman Richard A. Steinke says his firm hopes to have a prototype ready 
by early this fall. For its part, Nordica says that it considers the UTI 
chemical process promising but that it's too early to tell if it is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the early stages," said Gary Petrich, Nordica's western sales 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, all ski boot manufacturers use a complicated "injection molding" 
process whereby polyester pellets are melted down and poured into a mold. This 
method isn't very efficient, industry experts say, because up to 20% of the 
boots come out defective. One problem with the process is that the pellets 
sometimes don't melt completely. 
</P>
<P>
UTI, a small, publicly traded company, claims its so-called liquid phase 
technology enables ski boots to be manufactured without the bothersome heating 
system and the high rate of defective products. Steinke says UTI combines the 
chemicals isocyanate and polyol along with "a secret formulation" and then 
pours the mixture into a ski boot mold. The mold is spun at a high speed and 
the liquid solidifies. 
</P>
<P>
UTI claims the equipment needed to manufacture ski boots using its technology 
costs only 10% of the injection-molding method. Whether skiers would benefit by 
paying less for their boots remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
D. Paul Cohen, a San Francisco research analyst, calls UTI's process "the most 
significant technology that I've seen in 30 years on Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. has a contract with UTI to manufacture airless, 
solid tires that supposedly never go flat. Steinke boasts that "our patent 
alone could be worth a fortune because we have reinvented the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
But UTI's previous predictions haven't always come to pass. Two years ago, the 
company predicted it would garner at least $500 million in revenue from 
Goodyear between 1988 and 1993 as a result of its new tire-making process. But 
the company had sales from all sources of only $2 million last year, and its 
staff numbers only 17 people. 
</P>
<P>
Steinke asserted Wednesday that the ski-boot process could generate $25 million 
in sales from Nordica.

Parker Expanding: On the clean-air front, Parker Automotive Corp., the Costa 
Mesa company that produces a system for flushing carbon and other pollutants 
from internal combustion engine fuel systems, has signed exclusive agreements 
with distributors in five more European nations -- Liechtenstein, Switzerland, 
Sweden, Denmark and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, which manufactures its products in Fountain Valley, now has 
distribution agreements with major importers in nearly 60 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The company says that tests of its patented system, which flushes and cleans 
fuel systems with chemical products, have shown that it can cut emissions by as 
much as 95% while increasing fuel economy and engine performance. 
</P>
<P>
The latest trade pacts increase Parker's annual sales, now $20 million a year, 
to about $24 million, according to Michael E. Parker, president of the publicly 
traded firm.

VERLAINE'S ACOUSTIC SET LACKS ELECTRICITY;

THE GUITARIST'S SOLO EXCURSION AT THE COACH HOUSE WAS MINUS THE EXPRESSIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Like an exhibition of an artist's preliminary pencil sketches, a solo acoustic 
concert by a rocker who normally operates with a full band can give beholders a 
glimpse of pared-down essences, of the initial, unadorned vision behind the 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with Tom Verlaine's solo show Tuesday night at the Coach House was 
that the painterly analogy didn't always apply. Without a band and without 
electricity, a good deal of Verlaine's essence got lost. 
</P>
<P>
In much of his work, Verlaine is more like a master builder than a painter. 
Ever since he emerged in the 1970s as the leader of Television, Verlaine has 
been one of rock's most inventive guitar architects. His two albums with 
Television, and six subsequent solo albums (including the fine new import-only 
release, "The Wonder") all stand as excellent examples of the expressive 
capability of rock guitar. But take away Verlaine's ability to weave meaning 
through layered guitar structures and electric solo excursions, and you remove 
a large part of his work's essence. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional rock songwriters can strip their music down to voice and acoustic 
guitar and still have a miniature version of a whole -- a fairly comprehensive 
acoustic sketch of the full-color portrait they normally create with a band. 
For Verlaine, lyrics are often abstract and oblique -- offering sufficient 
clues to meanings, but not the whole story. It's left to his guitars and 
keyboard textures to shade meanings and to express the most intense emotions. 
</P>
<P>
While Verlaine made good use of dynamic shifts and well-placed pauses in his 
solo acoustic guitar accompaniments, he essentially stuck to basic chording and 
brief fills that hardly carried the expressive weight of his electric guitar 
work. The solo spotlight didn't flatter his limited voice, either. 
</P>
<P>
And with a dry, detached bearing that was as coolly mellow as a graveyard-shift 
disc jockey's, the gaunt, close-cropped singer wasn't about to win over an 
audience with chatty charm and self-revelation -- a favorite tactic of veteran 
solo acoustic performers (listeners who had come to hear opening singer Shawn 
Colvin -- apparently the majority of the small audience -- were hardly won 
over. Most of them exited early in Verlaine's 70-minute show, leaving only 50 
or so partisans to hear out his entire set). 
</P>
<P>
Unruffled by the early departures (a small audience is something this 
influential but underappreciated underground rock hero must be inured to by 
now), Verlaine sang with commitment and intensity throughout his show. 
</P>
<P>
It paid off on songs that followed more conventional narrative lines -- notably 
"Words From the Front," a straightforward monologue describing a foot soldier's 
fears on the eve of battle. Verlaine brought the character to life, his voice 
rising and cracking at the end to convey the anguish and bitterness beneath a 
stoical surface. 
</P>
<P>
The solo setting did help Verlaine underscore the humor in songs like the sexy 
"Kaleidescope" and "The Man in the Back Yard," an unrecorded number that took a 
furtive, bluesy cast. The oddity of the evening was Verlaine's concluding dip 
into country myth -- first with a direct enough rendering of Willie Nelson's 
"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain," then a convoluted medley of Johnny Cash's "Ring 
of Fire" and "I Walk the Line," which Verlaine embellished with a deadpan tale 
about Cash having an encounter with the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of straightforward, silver-voiced solo acoustic performance got it from 
Colvin. The small, sharp-featured singer sounded far more forceful on her own 
than she does on her debut album, which suffers from a too-clean, too-cool 
production job by a team of Suzanne Vega's cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
Colvin's songs tend toward introspection that is deeply felt, but too 
conventionally expressed. Live, this strong, confident singer gave the best of 
her songs extra presence and grit, and rounded out her 70-minute set with 
well-chosen, well-executed covers that included songs by the Band, Richard 
Thompson, Talking Heads and, in a nice, light surprise, the Foundations' "Baby, 
Now That I've Found You."

LOW-KEY PIANIST NOT IN A RUSH TO ACHIEVE STARDOM; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: BRYAN VERHOYE, A NATIVE OF SAN DIEGO, HAS A PHILOSOPHY THAT DOES NOT 
COINCIDE WITH THAT OF HIS OVERACHIEVING EAST COAST COLLEAGUES. HIS IS MORE 
REFLECTIVE OF HIS WEST COAST UPBRINGING.

<TEXT>
<P>
Right after Vladimir Horowitz's death in November, Bryan Verhoye's teacher at 
the Peabody Conservatory of Johns Hopkins University, William Doppmann, greeted 
him with the tongue-in-cheek challenge, "Well, there's a vacancy at the top." 
</P>
<P>
Though Verhoye appreciated the spirit of that remark, his musical goals have 
always been on a more gradual timetable. After the San Diego native won several 
competitions and honors on the West Coast -- including top prize in 1986 at the 
local Joseph Fisch Piano Competition and first place in 1989 at the Carmel 
Music Society Piano Competition -- he matriculated last fall in Peabody's 
graduate performance program. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Horowitz, however, did not solve a problem for Verhoye. Always 
looking for unusual repertory, Verhoye laboriously transcribed from a record 
Horowitz's improvised fantasy on themes from Bizet's "Carmen." He learned this 
flashy showpiece and wants to program it but has hesitated to give this 
purloined gem its proper authorship. 
</P>
<P>
"I had heard that he became quite irate with pianists who used his 
improvisations," Verhoye said, "and I still don't know what sort of rights his 
estate has to the piece." So Horowitz's "Carmen Fantasy" has to serve as a 
favored encore for recitals played far from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Before Verhoye left San Diego for Baltimore, he divided his time between 
playing recitals and competitions and providing tony background music for the 
Westgate Hotel's afternoon tea and the Fairbanks Ranch Country Club lounge. 
Then he went on a strict regimen of learning mounds of new repertory and 
collecting pearls of wisdom from Leon Fleisher's master classes. But he did 
confess to a few deviations from that musical asceticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone down to Washington a couple of times to play for (Sen.) Pete 
Wilson's parties," he said. For the record, the Wilson household prefers 
Broadway show tunes. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Wilson's favorite tune in the whole world is 'If I Loved You' from 
Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical 'Carousel,' " he noted. As an avocation, the 
senator's wife, Gayle, turns musical comedy lyrics into topical political 
parodies to entertain her guests. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the glut of aspiring young pianists on the apparently shrinking 
classical music market, this 28-year-old pianist is unperturbed by the 
challenge. Compared to his overachieving East Coast colleagues at Peabody, he 
notes his philosophy has the unmistakable hallmark of his unwavering Southern 
California outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"In an interview, Van Cliburn said that the true performer has to love playing 
so much that he cannot dream of living without it. That may have some truth, 
but you have to be able to know when that attitude has become an unhealthy 
obsession. You have to know when to stop trying to climb the mountain." 
</P>
<P>
Just don't count on Verhoye throwing in the towel prematurely.

'IN THE WORKS' FINALE AT GASCON INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A capacity crowd braved humid conditions Sunday at the Gascon Institute to view 
the last afternoon of "In the Works" this season. The program of choreography 
and commentary featured dances by Susan Rose and Ferne Ackerman. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, an early graduate of CalArts, returned to California last year after 
running a Boston-based modern dance ensemble. Her "Five Little Dances" is based 
on a grid of oranges. To recordings of Swedish folk music, she and Kelli King 
investigated, with great concentration and humor, the range of possible 
interactions between women and round fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"First Steps in the Shape of a Song" consisted of two brief solos to music from 
the sound track of "Diva." One of these was inspired, Rose told the audience, 
by the shape and texture of a dried palm frond; as danced by King it had an 
elegant, curving verticality. 
</P>
<P>
Rose also showed "The Eleventh Hour," a suite for five. To a percussion score 
by Mikel Rouse, it explored momentum and risk; the dancers fell backward into 
waiting arms and concluded the piece balanced in a human pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
Ferne Ackerman discussed the genesis of several of her familiar pieces and 
deconstructed a new dance, "Unseen Enemies," so that the audience could observe 
its inner workings. To a recording of cello music by Kodaly, four members of 
her company, Big Flood, performed the dance's gestural, grasping motions, 
punctuated by sharp exhalations of breath. ELIZABETH ZIMMER

DEL MAR FAIR-GOERS CAN SCREEN CONCERTS ON VIDEO

The Del Mar Fair grandstand concerts have finally entered the Video Age. 
</P>
<P>
This year's series of 20 evening pop concerts, starting Friday with a 
performance by the Little River Band, will also be broadcast live on a 20-foot 
video screen in the newly erected Infield Stage, across the race track from the 
grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if the 15,000-seat grandstand fills up for a show, concert-goers who are 
turned away at the door no longer will have to miss the performances. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had several concerts that sold out," said fair spokeswoman Diane 
Scholfield. "We couldn't fit any more people in the grandstand, and we had to 
turn people away. It was really too bad: We felt as bad as the people who got 
turned away. 
</P>
<P>
"So this year, we've arranged for a second stage in the infield of the race 
track, where at night, a few thousand more people can see and hear the 
grandstand concert on a video screen." 
</P>
<P>
The complete lineup of grandstand performers in the 1990 series is the usual 
grab-bag of pop, rock, soul, country and jazz acts: the Little River Band, 
Friday; Tom Jones, Saturday; the Charlie Daniels Band, Sunday; Lisa Lisa and 
Cult Jam, Monday; the Robert Cray Band, Tuesday; Donny Osmond, Wednesday; 
Dionne Warwick, June 21; Expose, June 22; Johnny Rivers, June 23; Poco, June 
24; and Kool and the Gang, June 25. 
</P>
<P>
Also on tap: Willie Nelson, June 26; the Band, June 27; Gordon Lightfoot, June 
28; Laura Branigan, June 29; John Kay and Steppenwolf, June 30; Air Supply, 
July 1; Natalie Cole, July 2; the Gap Band, July 3; and the Oak Ridge Boys, 
July 4 (the fair's closing night). 
</P>
<P>
In addition to these 20 evening shows, which start at 7:30 p.m., there will be 
two afternoon concerts starting at 2 p.m.: the Harry James Orchestra, June 21, 
and Carmen McRae, June 28. 
</P>
<P>
"We always try to get a wide variety of entertainment," Scholfield said. "The 
fair is for people of all ages, with all sorts of different musical tastes. And 
we have to take that into account when deciding on which acts to book: We try 
to get a little something for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Also as usual, there's a heavy emphasis on nostalgia, with no fewer than eight 
oldies acts in the lineup -- including such 1960s hit machines as Jones, 
Warwick, Rivers, the Band and Steppenwolf. 
</P>
<P>
"People are really into nostalgia," Scholfield said, "and these artists 
certainly bring back a lot of old memories. But at the same time, many of them 
are recording new stuff instead of merely living off oldies, thus broadening 
their appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"To give you an example, Tom Jones, who was Mr. '60s, recently recorded a cover 
of Prince's 'Kiss' (with Art of Noise) and it was a big hit. So now, a second 
generation is discovering his music from earlier times and liking it, and we'll 
probably get a cross-generational crowd for his show -- and for shows by other 
so-called oldies acts." 
</P>
<P>
While the Infield Stage will broadcast grandstand concerts at night, it will 
host a separate series of afternoon concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup: local classic-rockers Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love, 2 and 5 
p.m., Friday; 1960s singles band the Guess Who, 2 and 5 p.m., Saturday and 
Sunday; rhythm-and-blues group the Dynatones, 2 p.m., Monday, Tuesday and 
Wednesday; country singer Mel McDaniel, 2 and 5 p.m., June 22-24; country 
singer Claudia Nyggard, 2 p.m., June 25-27; "Animal House" frat-rockers Otis 
Day and the Knights, 2 and 5 p.m., June 29-July 1; and rhythm-and-blues band 
Jack Mack and the Heart Attack, 2 p.m., July 2-4.

May brought more than rain. It was also a time for the State Board of 
Equalization to shower $23.7 million on the county's 29 cities -- the latest 
installment of sales and use tax revenues. The total amount for the county, 
$24.9 million, included funds earmarked for county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
This most recent disbursement was 6% more than the county received last May, 
and the aggregate cities' figure was 9% higher. But not all the municipalities 
did better this May than last. Tustin's total was 33% below the comparable 
payment for 1989. Mission Viejo received 204% more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
Each month, city and county governments and other governmental organizations 
receive payments from the state in anticipation of actual sales tax revenues. 
In the fourth month, they receive a cleanup payment -- the difference between 
actual revenues and the amounts previously received -- plus the first advance 
payment for the next quarter. The amounts listed here are for the third advance 
payment for the first quarter of 1990.

California Senate Bill 813, enacted in 1983, asks that the content of 
secondary-school courses stimulate an improvement in the effort and performance 
of students nationwide. Thus spurred, the State Board of Education adopted 
school curriculums (developed by the superintendent of public instruction) with 
literary works of "compelling, intellectual, social or moral content," whose 
example by way of excellent use of language would encourage writing and 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Individual choices are made by Orange County school district committees, taking 
into account the perceived needs and abilities of their students. The Santa Ana 
Unified School District has a short core list of requirements for teachers to 
choose from (for example, one epic or one play among two or three). Extended 
readings are made at teachers' discretion: English is a second language for a 
large percentage of students. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Union High School District, at the other end of the 
spectrum, offers four tracks from grades 10 to 12: Honors, College Prep, 
Readings List and Fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
In the Capistrano Unified School District, junior and senior years don't share 
a central curriculum: Students may choose from a variety of electives to 
fulfill the necessary credits. The lists below only include English, American 
and world literature classes; other elective classes offer such topics as sea 
literature, sports literature and science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The lists compiled here began as lists of novels. However, because plays are 
not distinguished from novels within the core list in the Santa Ana and 
Capistrano school districts, drama has been added into other school district 
lists for the sake of consistency.

FAMILY LIFE: CHILD PROTECTION FUNDS RUNNING OUT AS ABUSE OF YOUNGSTERS GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the directors and staff of the county's Child Abuse Prevention Program are 
feeling a little neglected and abused themselves these days, you can't blame 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The money for the 4 1/2-year-old program runs out at the end of this month, and 
Gov. George Deukmejian has stricken any future funding from his 1990-91 budget. 
</P>
<P>
So, barring a miracle -- either from heaven or the Legislature -- that means 
CAPP's valuable services to Orange County schoolchildren have come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Ironic indeed, considering the rising incidence of abuse in the county. 
</P>
<P>
During its brief run, CAPP has reached a lot of people -- at least 120,000 
preschool through high school youngsters, in addition to any number of adults 
and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
It was, incidentally, after sitting through CAPP presentations that more than 
400 children sought relief from abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder how long it would have been -- if ever -- before those 400 cases 
would have been reported," asks CAPP official Nancy Dickerson, "if it hadn't 
been for the knowledge and assistance they received from us?" 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Deukmejian who signed the legislation in 1984 that gave 
birth to CAPP and its counterparts statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, CAPP -- working under the aegis of Community Services Programs in 
Orange County, has initiated and conducted educational programs in 26 of the 
county's 27 school districts (only Huntington Beach does not participate). 
</P>
<P>
Its work with children has been particularly effective, teaching them what 
child abuse is and showing them that in any form it is wrong and also teaching 
them how to report it. 
</P>
<P>
Workshops are also conducted for teachers to show them how to spot abuse. 
Parenting classes and community organization workshops have been conducted by 
CAPP too. 
</P>
<P>
The workshops, incidentally, have been available in English, Vietnamese and 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
And, overall, through CAPP and other efforts, reportings of child abuse in the 
county have risen by more than 50% in the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
CAPP's Orange County budget of $750,000 is small potatoes compared to many 
other state programs, but 99% of it comes from the statewide annual allocation 
of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dickerson, members of the governor's staff have insisted that the 
monies can come from other sources, particularly from the proceeds of 
Proposition 98, the school-funding measure passed by voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, she says, none of the school districts in the county have shown 
an inclination to share any of those funds with CAPP. 
</P>
<P>
"We conducted an informal survey (of the school districts), and they all say 
whatever extra money they get from Proposition 98 must go for what they call 
'educational needs,' although for the life of me I can't think of a better 
definition of a child abuse prevention program." 
</P>
<P>
CSP's executive director, Margot Carolson, worries that if the governor does 
not restore the funds, "it will send a mixed message to students, parents, 
staff and offenders -- that child abuse is not a major problem and therefore a 
low priority." 
</P>
<P>
So, where does CAPP go from here? 
</P>
<P>
"We're really in a strange place," says Dickerson, "with everyone from the 
governor on down praising our work and apparently assuming we'll get the money 
somewhere to continue it. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the Legislature favors the program, but it can't put funding back into 
the budget without the governor's approval. And, he tells us to get the money 
from the schools, who tell us they don't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she says CAPP is contacting private foundations and corporations, 
but such grants usually take time and that's something CAPP doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, you know," she points out, "we all will pay for such 
shortsightedness. "We either pay for education and prevention now or we pay a 
lot more -- at least double -- down the line for prisons and social services." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson says the group is soliciting both money and support from the 
community. Its phone number is (714) 634-3848.

HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: HAVING A BALL WALKING TALL IN THE MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six mornings a week, Dorothy Miller shows up at the Buena Park Mall at 7 a.m., 
three hours before the stores open. 
</P>
<P>
No, she's not the world's most devoted shopper trying to be first in line for 
bargains. Miller is a mall-walker, one of a growing number of Americans who are 
using the climate-controlled corridors of shopping malls for a purpose their 
builders never dreamed of: exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Not that shopping itself doesn't involve plenty of exercise: hiking in from the 
parking lot, sprinting from aisle to aisle, flexing elbows at crowded bargain 
tables and lifting heavy bags full of merchandise. But while that kind of 
exercise may be exhausting, it's not going to get you into shape. For that, you 
need regular, sustained, aerobic exercise, such as walking. 
</P>
<P>
So the mall and La Palma Intercommunity Hospital have teamed up to promote the 
"Walk Our Way" (WOW) program. The mall contributes to the program not only by 
opening its doors to walkers from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. daily, but by offering gift 
certificates, T-shirts and other prizes to participants. The hospital 
administers the program, keeping track of the number of miles walked and 
offering information, special events and other support to the walkers. 
</P>
<P>
Miller walks three miles on each of her morning mall visits, and she covers 
that ground so quickly that she barely has time to glance at the storefronts 
she passes. She has to walk briskly -- and without stopping -- in order to 
bring her pulse rate up and keep it up for a sustained period. Cardiologists 
and exercise experts say that that is necessary to burn fat and improve 
cardiovascular fitness. 
</P>
<P>
"They say walking is the most natural exercise in the world," Miller says. 
"There isn't much risk of injury, and you don't need special clothes, other 
than good walking shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Three mornings a week, Miller is joined in her mall walks by two of her Anaheim 
neighbors, Myra Rilpel and Goldie Schiessl. The three women say they could just 
walk around the neighborhood, but they prefer the mall because "it's more 
interesting. You see different things here all the time. They're always 
changing the displays," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
The women also say they feel safe in the mall -- security guards are walking 
around, too, albeit not as fast -- and they like the fact that it's 
climate-controlled. That's not so important here as it is in other parts of the 
country, where rain, snow and extreme temperatures can make regular outdoor 
walking difficult. In fact, the mall-walking trend first showed up back East, 
then made its way West. 
</P>
<P>
Although some mall-walkers get their exercise during regular business hours, 
Miller and her friends say they prefer the early morning because "we could 
never walk this fast if the stores were open and there were people around." 
</P>
<P>
The women have formed a support group for each other. They car-pool to the 
mall, taking turns driving. "Sometimes you just want to go back to sleep in the 
morning," Schiessl says, "But you know they're going to be going, so you get 
up." 
</P>
<P>
C.W. Elliott of Buena Park walks two miles in the mall every day, and has 
logged more than 2,500 miles. Last year, when he passed the 2,000-mile mark, he 
received a $100 gift certificate from the mall. His wife, Vera, accompanies him 
on many days and has earned her 1,000-mile trophy. 
</P>
<P>
When the 78-year-old great-grandfather started walking two years ago, however, 
he had trouble getting from his car to the mall because of the poor circulation 
in his legs. Now his health has improved so much that he has no trouble keeping 
a brisk pace, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Signs are posted throughout the mall to indicate mileage. It's about half a 
mile around each of the mall's two levels. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's community education department recommends checking with a 
physician before beginning a walking program to make sure that the exercise 
will be safe for you. You'll need good walking shoes, with thick, flat, 
flexible soles. Don't walk for two hours after eating a full meal, and wait 20 
minutes after walking before eating. 
</P>
<P>
Take your pulse before you start -- most people have a resting heart rate of 
between 60 and 75 beats per minute. Determine your maximum heart rate by 
subtracting your age from 220. For maximum cardiovascular fitness, you should 
exercise at 60% to 75% of your maximum heart rate and work up to 80%. Always 
spend the first and last five minutes walking slowly. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital recommends walking at least three times per week. You can begin 
with a short 15-minute walk -- that's five minutes of slow walking, five more 
minutes of brisk walking followed by five minutes of slow walking -- and work 
up to a 40-minute walk over a 12-week period. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about the WOW program, call (714) 670-6050. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County malls also offer walking programs. 
</P>
<P>
At the Brea Mall, "Club Ped," sponsored by St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation 
Center, meets daily at 9 a.m. A physical therapist from the hospital is 
available on Mondays and Thursdays to answer questions. For more information, 
call (714) 992-3000. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Center Mall is in the process of starting a program, but meanwhile 
walkers are welcome beginning at 7 a.m. Call (714) 897-2533 to find out more 
about the program, co-sponsored by Humana Hospital in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At MainPlace in Santa Ana, St. Joseph Hospital of Orange sponsors the "Pacers 
Club" from 9 to 10 a.m. Monday through Friday. Although the program is free, 
the hospital requests that participants sign a registration form. Call (714) 
771-8040 for more information. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills Mall is planning to set up a formal program in the fall, but 
meanwhile the mall is open at 8 a.m. for those who want to come in and walk. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Plaza is open for walkers from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., although the 
center has no formal program. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Mall and Humana Hospital co-sponsor the Mallwalker program, which 
begins at 9 a.m. daily. Participants are asked to sign up for the free program, 
and awards are given to those who walk 50 miles or more. Call (714) 898-2558.

AN AIDS TREATMENT UNDERGROUND HAS BEEN OPERATING HERE FOR OVER A YEAR. THE 
THERAPY IS PROVIDED BY A RESPECTED PHYSICIAN. AIDS PATIENTS JUST HOPE THEY WILL 
OUTLAST THE WAITING LIST.

John arrived exactly on time for his Monday morning appointment. Tall, 
blue-eyed and slender, he was about to undergo a treatment -- a treatment that 
might not make him better and that could theoretically threaten the medical 
license of the physician offering it. 
</P>
<P>
But the 41-year-old blond businessman looked refreshed and calm, even eager. 
Minutes later, the technician from the doctor's medical laboratory welcomed him 
warmly. He ushered John past a bubbling aquarium, down a hall and into an 
examination room. 
</P>
<P>
A plastic bag of blood plasma hung beside the bed. The plasma was collected 
from anonymous donors, people not as sick as John, but who match his blood 
type. As John sat down, the technician gave him a tablet of Benadryl and a tiny 
cup of water. "Just in case of an allergic reaction," he explained. John 
swallowed the pill and stretched out. The technician swabbed his forearm with 
rubbing alcohol, gingerly inserted the intravenous needle and started the 
plasma flowing. For the next 20 minutes, John lay still as it dripped into his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
John had just undergone passive immunotherapy, an experimental, underground 
treatment he fervently hoped would halt the deterioration of his immune system 
from AIDS. He tested positive in 1985 for the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), and since then has had Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer common in AIDS 
patients, removed from his leg. In late 1988, his T-cell count, one medical 
barometer of immune system functioning, declined drastically. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor who provides the monthly transfusions is doing so because he 
believes the treatment shows promise. John has a more immediate motivation: he 
wants to live. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
During the last year, 65 other AIDS patients have joined this Los Angeles 
underground. Before the treatment -- which does not have the blessing of the 
Food and Drug Administration -- almost all had lost weight. Many have had 
numerous hospitalizations to treat pneumonia, inflammation of the pancreas, 
liver problems and spleen abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
Each has gone quietly to the same medical laboratory, operated by a prominent 
Los Angeles immunologist, who agreed to discuss the treatment and his reasons 
for offering it on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by an English scientist, the treatment is believed to boost the 
immune systems of AIDS patients in declining health, by giving them 
antibody-rich plasma from patients who test positive for the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but are still healthy. 
</P>
<P>
All but three of the 66 AIDS patients who have undergone the treatment in Los 
Angeles are still alive, according to the physician who offers it, and most 
credit their their current state of relative health -- and their improved 
T-cell counts -- to the therapy. 
</P>
<P>
The first patient, who has by now received 14 infusions, said he has gone from 
sleeping around the clock to a more productive life that includes work and 
walking a mile a day. He will speak freely about his progress, but won't allow 
his name to be used, since his family has no idea he has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
His testimonials and those of dozens of other HIV-positive patients -- coupled 
with the convictions of a handful of doctors -- have spawned the treatment 
underground. Even though it has operated for more than a year, it is still not 
well-known, some say, even by AIDS patients. Many hear of it by word of mouth 
or through articles in the gay press, just as they have heard of many numerous 
other AIDS underground treatments. The waiting list, which now includes 77 
people, is unusual. It operates not on a "first-come, first-served" basis but a 
"sickest-go-first" order. 
</P>
<P>
The covert network was born of one man's gut-wrenching depression. In the 
spring of 1988, Christopher Gerard, a former actor and business manager, 
returned home after another funeral, feeling dismal. It was his 45th friend to 
die of AIDS. "To say I was depressed is understatement," recalls Gerard. "Bobby 
was a gifted artist, a kid I grew up with in New Jersey. To make it worse, his 
brother had passed away -- from AIDS -- just six months before." Gerard sat in 
the Hollywood Hills condominium he shares with his companion of nine years, 
feeling paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Some days later, he got a telephone call from a friend, and they talked about 
the terrible toll of AIDS, of mutual friends lost to the disease. Then she 
mentioned a Cable News Network report about a new AIDS treatment. She 
remembered the name -- passive immunotherapy -- and had written down the name 
of the scientist and his university. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard spent the next few days thinking. He tracked down Abraham Karpas at the 
University of Cambridge. "I asked him, "What's being done in America?' " Karpas 
knew only of a study planned by the Bronx Veterans Administration Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard enticed Karpas to fly to the United States in November, 1988. Together 
they persuaded the Los Angeles physician to begin offering the treatment to 
AIDS patients. Since the first patient was infused 14 months ago, Gerard has 
asked 27 other physicians to do the same. One New York doctor is about to begin 
offering the treatment, Gerard said, and he's in touch with a Texas doctor who 
has expressed interest. Dr. Richard Stiehm, UCLA professor of pediatrics and 
co-director of the Los Angeles County Pediatric AIDS Consortium, who already 
knew of Karpas' work, plans to give the treatment next week to a child in the 
advanced stages of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
But all the other physicians Gerard asked to provide the therapy have turned 
him down. "Without a study, they are terrified," said Gerard, who directs the 
underground and serves as president of the L.A. chapter of the Passive 
Immunotherapy (PATH) Foundation, a nonprofit educational organization based in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The plasma used in passive immunotherapy is an unapproved drug and, strictly 
speaking, its use is illegal, said Allen Davidson, spokesman for the California 
Department of Health Services' Food and Drug Branch. "There is legal opinion 
indicating a physician can use new drugs within the confines of their 
practices," Davidson added, "but doctors (who do so) do open themselves up to 
liability." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles doctor who provides passive immunotherapy is well aware of 
those risks but passionate about the effectiveness of the treatment. He says he 
can't believe he would ever be penalized for providing what he views as 
compassionate care, and has invested "at least six figures" of his own money to 
finance treatments for patients who cannot pay. Gerard says he has raised 
another $20,000 to fund treatments. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, money may be the easy part. Week after week, Gerard schedules an 
information meeting, explaining to a new group of AIDS patients about passive 
immunotherapy, about the need to keep the doctor's name confidential, about the 
overwhelming need to find more donors and, last but not least, the chances of 
getting to the top of the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
At 45, Gerard is trim, with the kind of solid good looks and passion for his 
cause that would seem to make persuasion second nature. But Gerard has not only 
been rejected by cautious physicians; he has appealed unsuccessfully to several 
AIDS groups for donors, patients and support. "In the beginning," said Gerard, 
"I called one AIDS group 30 days in a row." But skepticism and apathy are 
almost inevitable, he says, when patients hear about one "miracle" treatment 
after another. Some see passive immunotherapy as just another flimsy promise, 
another blind alley. "Some people are just 'drug du joured' out," Gerard said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the word about passive immunotherapy is spreading, and "Establishment" 
medicine is beginning to give it a serious look. The clinical trial at Bronx 
Veterans Administration Medical Center has enrolled 70 patients. "The results 
seem encouraging," said Elliott Block, president of Medicorp, the 
Montreal-based firm funding the study. And now, two other clinical trials of 
the treatment may begin this summer. HemaCare, a Sherman Oaks-based provider of 
blood-related services and products, will enroll up to 225 patients, said 
company spokeswoman Tanya Youvan . Dimension Laboratories, based in Utah, will 
start a 40-patient study soon, said James Marshall, president. 
</P>
<P>
Passive immunotherapy for AIDS is simple in concept but not in execution. Blood 
plasma from donors is first tested to be sure it meets strict criteria. Donors 
who don't qualify may not have high enough concentrations of antibodies 
(protective proteins that fight foreign proteins) in their blood; they may have 
low levels of "helper cells" (the so-called sentinels of the immune system) or 
they may have active HIV virus. If their plasma passes all tests, it is 
processed and treated to inactivate any infectious agents before infusion into 
AIDS patients. Recipients get plasma that has been taken from several donors 
and mixed to ensure a good cross-section of antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment works, proponents say, because the plasma from the still-healthy 
donors contains high levels of antibodies against the virus that boosts the 
immune systems of AIDS patients. (It is different than the treatment recently 
reported by Atlanta doctors, who diverted an AIDS patient's blood into a heat 
exchanger, heated it to 115 degrees Fahrenheit, and reinfused it. They claimed 
they found no evidence of the virus three months later.) 
</P>
<P>
Passive immunotherapy is expensive, partly because the process of 
plasma-gathering is so painstakingly arduous. The cost per donor is about $400 
to run the necessary blood-screening tests. For AIDS patients, the cost of each 
treatment ranges from $300 to $700, depending on the number of donors who must 
be screened to find enough qualified ones. Many recipients pay nothing for the 
treatment; others pay on a sliding scale. "It really has the best potential 
right now," the Los Angeles doctor who offers it said recently. "I would love 
to find a drug with the same potential." 
</P>
<P>
The doctor and other proponents of the therapy point to British studies that 
find it can buy time. In 1985, Karpas began providing the treatment, eventually 
infusing 17 patients. Of the nine who remained in follow-up, three are still 
alive, he told physicians attending a recent lecture at UCLA, where he was 
invited to speak by Stiehm. 
</P>
<P>
With the treatment, he said, "we see a dramatic increase -- about eightfold -- 
in the levels of antibodies within a month." 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers, reporting in the medical journal, The Lancet, in late 1988 
on use of the treatment in six patients with advanced AIDS, said the antibody 
effects persisted for up to 11 weeks after a single infusion. 
</P>
<P>
The health of donors does not seem to suffer. Karpas followed one donor for 
about a year and found that the donations "didn't affect his T-4 count at all." 
Said one Los Angeles man, who began donating six months ago: "My T-4 count has 
remained constant." He cites psychological benefits as well. "Being able to 
donate my plasma takes me out of my own fears. It's very healing." 
</P>
<P>
Even though some doctors say there is not yet enough science behind passive 
immunotherapy, activists counter that treatment is needed now, not after a 
dozen studies. Gerard points to the plight of men like Matthew, an AIDS patient 
who spoke recently at one of the weekly information meetings, about his first 
experience with passive immunotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard opened the meeting, as usual, by explaining the treatment to newcomers. 
Then Matthew, a dark-haired man with the physique of a long-distance runner but 
a fraction of the stamina, shuffled to the front of the classroom and half-sat 
on the teacher's desk. Like most of the 14 others in the room, he stopped short 
of telling his full name, wary of jeopardizing his own privacy and the life of 
the underground. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistically, I really shouldn't be here right now," Matthew began. "I was 
diagnosed with AIDS in 1985. I tried an experimental treatment . . . and it 
just about killed me. I got myself out of the hospital Sunday to start this 
therapy Monday. That's how absolutely convinced I was something good would come 
out of it. I could barely walk in to the treatment, but I walked out with a 
spring in my stride. I will be there next month, no question. I had absolutely 
no side effects." 
</P>
<P>
He started to sit down, then added one last comment. "All of this is not done 
in some dank, dark basement. I watched MTV while I had this treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. AIDS experts agree that the treatment looks promising. "Studies 
appear to give some benefit to patients by making them feel better" and 
decreasing their viral activity, said Dr. Joel Weisman, UCLA assistant clinical 
professor of medicine who cares for many AIDS patients in his Beverly Hills and 
Sherman Oaks practices. Weisman, with Dr. Michael Gottlieb, is credited with 
writing the first published report describing AIDS in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives patients a chance to rejuvenate," said Dr. Michael Roth, a Santa 
Monica allergist and immunologist who cares for many AIDS patients. "The 
earlier it is used, the better. But even if it is used late (in the course of 
AIDS), people can feel physically better." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, there are substantial caveats voiced about the treatment and the 
underground. "The best way to validate a treatment is to do it (in a) medically 
correct (way), which means not underground," said Elliot Block of Medicorp, 
which also licensed HemaCare to provide the treatments for the upcoming 
clinical trial. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman brings up a worrisome concern. There is some evidence, he said, that 
Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a different organism than HIV. "It's only a 
theory, but there's a possibility of transmitting KS (via passive 
immunotherapy) to those who don't have it." 
</P>
<P>
Other experts say passive immunotherapy is too complicated to set up in a 
doctor's office and are concerned about costs. "It is labor intensive," said 
one doctor familiar with the process. "And it's dependent on donors." The blood 
must be cleansed properly to eliminate any infectious agents. "All together," 
said one AIDS activist, "it's far more complicated than 'Here, take this pill . 
. .' " 
</P>
<P>
Some criticize the treatment on the grounds that the studies in England involve 
too few patients. Others believe the treatment may work for only a small 
segment of patients. Said Martin Delaney, executive director of Project Inform, 
a San Francisco clearinghouse for HIV treatment information, "From the 
researchers I talk to, it's a relatively narrow approach that only deals with a 
small part of the pathology of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Most, including Karpas, see its role as a "buy-time" therapy, a treatment that 
could perhaps be used in combination with other treatments. In the future, 
Karpas predicted, antibodies will be able to be artificially produced in the 
laboratory, eliminating the need for donors. Some AIDS patients cheer the 
approval of the two planned studies. But others worry that a patent dispute 
simmering between the two companies approved for the clinical trials will delay 
the start of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of humor helps, said Gerard, who says he has heard rumblings of 
clinical trials for at least two years. "I've threatened," Gerard joked, "to 
make up T-shirts for HemaCare that say, 'Next week, next week.' " 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the underground alive is an uphill battle, even for someone as 
hard-driving as Gerard. Some of his fellow activists say he has tunnel vision. 
So intent is he on promoting passive immunotherapy that he sees a role for 
little else. In his quest for donors and doctors, some say, he can be abrasive. 
And he's not above name-calling, said one acquaintance. "Chris is quick to 
point fingers. He doesn't like some doctors." 
</P>
<P>
Gerard takes it all with a grain of salt and a shrug of the shoulders. "I've 
even been accused," he said with a laugh, "of looking for a political career." 
</P>
<P>
Gerard seems to spend less time worrying about what his detractors say than 
about getting burned-out AIDS patients enthused about the treatment. Those who 
do come to the weekly information meetings are often coaxed into it, he said, 
by friends, lovers, mothers, fathers and others concerned about the patient. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond finding a way to lengthen the life of AIDS patients, Gerard has another 
dream. "I would love to create a coalition of terminally ill fighters," Gerard 
said. "People with leukemia and Alzheimer's, for instance. People with multiple 
sclerosis and Lou Gehrig's disease. We all hear the same thing -- that it will 
take five to 10 years more of research (to find a cure)." 
</P>
<P>
Three telephone lines in his condo are devoted to the treatment program. Some 
days, the calls seem never to stop. The conversations with AIDS patients -- 
some of whom have been on the waiting list for months -- can take their toll. 
"When the phone rings," Gerard said, "sometimes I say aloud, 'I know, I know. 
You're going to die."' Then he does his best to empathize. 
</P>
<P>
Fending off bribes comes with the territory. "One person offered me $10,000 to 
be next for treatment," said Gerard, who patiently explained the philosophy of 
"sickest go first." 
</P>
<P>
One man knows that all too well. He's been on the "noncritical" waiting list 
since February but has been "bumped" 14 times when sicker people needed the 
treatment. "I feel disappointed, but I do understand," he said. "I've seen so 
many friends die hideous deaths." On another occasion, Gerard said, one hopeful 
recipient offered to "barter" donors. "I can get you 10 donors," he told 
Gerard, "if you just get me treated." 
</P>
<P>
But Gerard has found some people to depend on. Father Jack Beattie, the pastor 
of St. Ambrose Church in West Hollywood where Gerard attends Mass regularly, 
provides a school classroom for the weekly information meetings. Gerard says 
his religion is a wellspring of comfort as well. That, he said, is largely due 
to Father Jack's attitude: "This is the one place," said Beattie, "where 
everyone should feel welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Preston Coons, 39, of Silver Lake, serves as volunteer coordinator for the 
underground, intent on finding donors. Since February, he has carried around 
flyers explaining passive immunotherapy and the donor search. "I have put up 
these flyers all over my neighborhood -- in the bookstore, the restaurant, the 
laundromat, my dentist's office, the discount pharmacy -- everywhere I thought 
there would be healthy, HIV-infected individuals. So far we've had good 
response." 
</P>
<P>
Gerard said he gets much support from his long-time companion and from his 
mother. And Gerard takes solace from the testimonies of optimists like John. 
</P>
<P>
Since testing positive, John has tried Science of Mind, self-hypnosis, 
acupuncture and medication. Nothing worked for long, and he had gotten 
discouraged. The opportunity to try passive immunotherapy has given him hope, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I am taking control. I know this is only going to buy me time. But I 
want to stay where I am -- with an immune system impaired but still working. 
When you have AIDS, you really don't have many choices. The time clock is 
ticking. If I thought it would do any good, I would eat wooden nickels."

A LITTLE YANKEE INGENUITY GOES OFF TO LE MANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is a Cinderella story where even Cinderella looks a little homely. 
</P>
<P>
It involves a rookie racing team without sponsors and a 2-year-old Chevrolet 
Corvette prototype that in a previous life entered nine races, won none and 
regularly finished behind the tow truck. 
</P>
<P>
The car does have a new 900-h.p. engine that cost $40,000. But the motor was 
designed primarily for cabin cruisers and drag racers. It has never been 
installed in a car and has logged fewer test miles than the average lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this unknown, under-financed, untested and certainly baldfaced Eagle 
Performance Racing Team of Santa Barbara is in France anyway. 
</P>
<P>
And on Saturday it will be America's only entry in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 
toughest ordeal for drivers and machines since Patton pounded through Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we're a low-budget effort and even getting there will be a major 
accomplishment," said team driver Dennis Kazmerowski, 43, of Morristown, N.J., 
before the group flew to Paris. Kazmerowski has been racing cars for 15 years 
but far from the rarefied level of Le Mans. "I think we'll be 20 miles (per 
hour) off the pace . . . our aim is to start the race and be around at the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Team founder and co-owner Paul Canary could sing no happier tune. "It's an 
horrendous challenge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Canary, 50, restores collector cars in Santa Barbara and is the only member of 
Eagle Performance Racing who actually has driven the 8.3-mile road circuit at 
Le Mans. "That was in 1981. But we had a French driver who had an accident in 
qualifying and we didn't get to start the race," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Former drag racer and car designer Joe Schubeck, 52, head of Eagle Engine Co. 
of Westlake Village, built the power plant for the team's recycled Corvette. 
"What we've got here is a dedicated, flag-waving, fired-up, gutsy patriotic 
effort that says 'Born in the U.S.A.,' " Schubeck said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, that doesn't win races. So the object is to keep the car alive 
. . . and if we get close to the end, maybe then we'll be able to kick butt and 
do a little dragging down the straightaways." 
</P>
<P>
Kick derriere at Le Mans? Mon dieu! 
</P>
<P>
For Le Mans is the Indy 500 of Europe and Mardi Gras with croissants. This 
small city of grain and Gothic architecture, 112 miles southwest of Paris, was 
the birthplace of grand prix racing in 1906. It also was the death place for 80 
people in 1955 when a Mercedes rolled and spun into spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Le Mans is a circuit of remorseless extremes varying from the 250-m.p.h. 
Mulsanne straight followed by floor pedal braking for Arnage Corner that must 
be taken at a dawdle. Men have been expendable throughout this daylong ordeal 
because the history of Le Mans is written as periods of domination by 
manufacturers and not drivers: the Bentley years; the Alfa Romeo reign; the 
Jaguar, Ford and Ferrari eras. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar has arrived at this year's Le Mans with four cars, a dozen engines, 
several transporters loaded with parts, 150 helpers, rented helicopters -- and 
a large slice of the $25 million Jaguar annually spends on big sports car 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan is entering seven cars at Le Mans. Toyota, three. Mazda, three. And 
there will be 22 Porsches filling a field of supercars capable of topping 250 
m.p.h. and racing 3,000 miles in one day. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not," noted Canary, "too many out-and-out junkers there." 
</P>
<P>
Le Mans represents million-dollar American drivers who ascended to legend: Dan 
Gurney. Phil Hill. Carroll Shelby. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots for Eagle Performance Racing are Canary, Kazmerowski and amateur 
sports car racer Daver Vegher, 30, of San Francisco; all are driving for 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Factory drivers usually arrive at Le Mans by Concorde from New York or private 
jet from Zurich. Members of Eagle Performance Racing booked early on Pan Am 
from LAX to Paris and traveled midweek to qualify for a $600 seat in economy 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Our entire budget for the car and engines, putting everything together and 
getting everybody to France has been $500,000," said Canary. "We (Canary and 
Santa Barbara business associates Jay Drake and Jim Brucker) raised that by 
selling off a couple of classic race cars . . . a couple of CanAm racers and 
the car that Johnny Rutherford drove to second place in the 1975 Indianapolis 
500." 
</P>
<P>
In world racing, sponsors pay up to $2 million to have their products 
advertised on big-name cars. Goodyear gives tires to its blessed favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodyear wouldn't even sell us tires for Le Mans because they are dealing with 
other entries," said team manager Drake. "We went for Bridgestone and paid full 
price. 
</P>
<P>
"We turned down sponsorship from a soft drink company. They wanted to paste 
their name all over the car for $20,000. We decided we didn't want to sell our 
soul for that." 
</P>
<P>
Discounting all underdog parallels, there is indeed a proud, solid soul to 
Eagle Performance Racing. 
</P>
<P>
The idea began with Canary a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted another shot at the race denied him in 1981, one more opportunity to 
make some small scratch on the history of "the ultimate challenge in sports car 
racing . . . Le Mans, the hardest to win, the most historic, the most 
nostalgic, the most prestigious." 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the spiritual was the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Canary -- through his Santa Barbara Competition Motorsports -- wants to 
manufacture a limited-edition American supercar. 
</P>
<P>
In his mind, it will be faster than the 200-m.p.h. Ferrari F40 street car that 
goes on sale in the United States this summer and will accelerate quicker than 
the proposed Jaguar 220. It will also be a precise copy and a legal street 
version of the car Canary has taken to Le Mans. 
</P>
<P>
"That means a top speed of 250 m.p.h. with a zero-to-100 m.p.h. time of between 
six and seven seconds," Canary explained. "So Le Mans, for us, is an 
opportunity to get some publicity for the car and the engine for when we 
produce copies for street use." 
</P>
<P>
Few cars could be more all-American than Canary's Le Mans car. Although built 
on an aluminum honeycomb chassis developed by Lola, a British firm, the 1988 
car was constructed as a Corvette prototype racer powered by a short block 
Chevrolet V-8. 
</P>
<P>
But in two seasons of American racing, the Corvette GTP fell out of the money 
and short of its promise. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't have enough horsepower," said Drake. "It was a sprint engine, a 
high-compression engine that couldn't last for two or three hours of racing." 
</P>
<P>
Kazmerowski, a Corvette racer, bought the car when it was retired from racing. 
He sold it to Canary, who then went looking for an engine and found Schubeck 
working on a huge and thundering thing of aluminum and steel and double 
overhead cams. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a V-8 engine that combines European engine technology with American brute 
horsepower," said Schubeck. "Think of it as a (European) Formula One engine on 
steroids." 
</P>
<P>
It also was an engine that Schubeck -- while developing new techniques for 
cooling cylinders and strengthening the engine block to allow higher horsepower 
-- was designing for dragsters and off-shore cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
"That didn't matter," said Canary. "What he had was a big, powerful motor 
giving high speed at slow revs (engine revolutions), and 860 h.p at 5,200 revs 
should be ideal for Le Mans." 
</P>
<P>
So the car was built and tested at Willow Springs race track near Rosamond. The 
drivers reported that it ran powerfully, was well balanced and very quick out 
of the turns. 
</P>
<P>
"But, basically, despite working night and day for the past six weeks, we have 
run out of time," continued Drake. "We should have spent more time testing the 
engine. We should have been running with a more rigid chassis, one built for 
this race." 
</P>
<P>
Additional time might have produced a richer, kinder sponsor. More money would 
have purchased backup engines. Yet in such shortages, Drake added, there are 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sad to realize that everybody loves a winner only after you have 
won," Drake said. "And that there's no reward for old-fashioned Yankee know-how 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
"But facing that has become about 50% of our incentive. We want to show people 
that hard labor can offset cost and that individual dedication can be worth 
much more than a $2-million race budget." 
</P>
<P>
So Eagle Performance is off to the races in mismatched driving suits and with 
no frills to spare. Canary, Kazmerowski and Vegher will familiarize themselves 
with Le Mans by driving the circuit in a rental van. Their only spare engine is 
one borrowed from Schubeck. 
</P>
<P>
This team cannot possibly win. 
</P>
<P>
But that's exactly what everyone said when Cameroon trotted out to play 
Argentina in last week's World Cup.

JACK SMITH: TRAUMATIC HIATUS: TAKING A DETOUR TO THE DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found out the other day what it would be like not having my wife; I don't 
think I have the mettle for it. 
</P>
<P>
She woke me up at about 12:30 in the morning. She said she had a terrible pain 
in her chest. She was moaning and crying out and bending over. Her usual 
reaction to any indisposition is embarrassment. She doesn't like to think that 
anything could be wrong with her. 
</P>
<P>
I was alarmed. I decided to wake up our doctor. He said to call the paramedics 
and have her taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
I called 911. A few minutes later a fire engine came. Then the ambulance. One 
of the ambulance men looked familiar. Big, good-looking man named Jim 
Goldsworthy. He said, "I remember you." 
</P>
<P>
He was one of the crew that had taken me to County Hospital when I had my 
"arrhythmic episode." He said, "I didn't think you were going to make it." I 
almost didn't. 
</P>
<P>
They took my wife away in the ambulance. I followed in my car. By the time I 
parked and went into the emergency unit she was already in bed with tubes in 
her arms. 
</P>
<P>
The duty doctor, Dr. Roy Antelyes, said it was too early for a diagnosis. He 
said he was going to call our doctor, Tom Callister. I hated to think of that 
poor man having to get out of bed and get dressed, but of course that's his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the duty nurse, Melanie Crowley, was being very cheerful. I don't 
know how they can be cheerful in those places. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Callister arrived and began examining my wife. He said they would have to 
make some extensive tests. It would take time. She told him the annual 
dinner-dance of her counseling center was Friday night (the next day) and she 
had to be there. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor shook his head. "No way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the cardiologist would examine her in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
I got home at 3:30 and went to sleep about 4. At 7:30 she called. "Were you 
asleep?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was I worried about her the next day, but I felt guilty when I had to 
do her chores. She is really overworked. First, I had to feed the cats. She 
feeds five wild cats every morning. They gather on the front porch, whining and 
screeching. I hadn't the slightest idea how to feed them. I found a large can 
of cat food and divided it between two bowls and put them out on the porch and 
withdrew my hands quickly. If that wasn't enough for them let the beggars 
starve. 
</P>
<P>
Then I had to feed the dog. Then I had to make coffee. She had given me a list 
of last-minute chores pertaining to the dinner-dance. I had to go to Supervisor 
Ed Edelman's office to pick up a resolution. I parked at The Times, walked up 
hill to Temple and Grand, and found Edelman's office on the eighth floor at the 
end of a long hall. 
</P>
<P>
Then I had to deliver the resolution to the Southern California Counseling 
Center, of which she is administrative director. She believes that the 
dinner-dance can not take place without her. Everyone was stunned to hear that 
she was in the hospital. She is not supposed to get sick. 
</P>
<P>
Then I had to keep a date to talk to the Friends of the Center at a luncheon in 
Beverly Hills. By then I was a nervous wreck. Then I drove to the hospital. 
Because of new construction, the hospital is almost inaccessible. I had to park 
in a new parking structure and take a shuttle to the hospital itself. I carried 
a bouquet given me by the luncheon hostess. The hospital is a labyrinth. It 
took me 20 minutes to find her room, and it was guarded like Ft. Knox. She was 
in intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
She was watching a soap opera. She said they hadn't found any heart damage but 
they had to do more tests. She said she was going to get out. I said, "No way." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning she called me and said to stand by. She was going to get out. 
I was afraid she was simply going to put on her robe and escape. "Don't do 
anything foolish," I told her. 
</P>
<P>
I had to feed the dog and the cats again. I was really beginning to appreciate 
her. The phone kept ringing. A deliveryman hammered on the door. Later she 
called and said to come and get her. She had talked her way out. She told me to 
bring her some underwear, a dress and some shoes. I found the designated 
articles and stuffed them in a shopping bag and drove to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
She was ready to go. "You're not going to the dance," I said hopefully. "You 
bet I am," she said. 
</P>
<P>
I was frazzled out, but I had to dress in my tux and escort her. 
</P>
<P>
They think she had a hiatus hernia, whatever that is.

FIREARMS: WHO TAKES THE BLAME WHEN ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS OCCUR? MOST CITE A LACK 
OF PROPER EDUCATION IN HANDLING HANDGUNS.

Officially, the cause of Christian Wiedepuhl's death was a .38 caliber bullet 
in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
It was fired at point blank range by another 17-year-old boy, who was examining 
his parents' pistol in an upstairs room of the family's Anaheim Hills home on 
the afternoon of May 24. The slug struck Wiedepuhl above the right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Four years earlier, at the same hour and in the same room, the same boy, then 
in junior high school, fired a round while examining his parents' shotgun and 
killed 13-year-old Jeffrey Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the cause of Jeffrey Bush's death was three 12-gauge shotgun 
pellets in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, however, these two extraordinary deaths may be far more complex. 
Many believe the four bits of lead that snuffed out two young lives were not 
causes but consequences of living in a society in which between 60 million and 
65 million citizens own firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Who to blame? It depends on whom you talk to. 
</P>
<P>
The Wiedepuhl death is being investigated by police and the Bush case has been 
re-opened, but for the time being both shootings are considered accidents. So 
was it the boy's fault? Or were his parents guilty of improperly storing and 
securing the weapons? Should they have kept guns in their home at all? Should 
they have educated their son in the proper handling of the guns? Should they 
have been sold the weapons in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
In the United States each day, an average of one child dies in an accidental 
shooting, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Center to Prevent Handgun 
Violence. And, according to a study of unintentional shootings conducted by the 
organization, the deadliest months of the The study of 532 shootings asserts 
that such accidents among children 16 and under increase dramatically during 
the summer and December holiday seasons. It also found that 42% of the 
shootings occurred in the afternoon; in two-thirds of the cases, the children 
were unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
A second study conducted by the center addressed itself specifically to 
handguns. It found that three of four handguns used in 266 unintentional 
shootings were owned by the parents of the victims or shooters, that 38% of the 
shootings occurred in the homes of friends and relatives, and that 50% occurred 
in the victims' own homes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, handguns proliferate. According to National Rifle Assn. statistics, 65 
million handguns are owned by between 30 and 35 million people, 58% of whom say 
they own the gun primarily for protection. And 4.6 million people, or 13% of 
the owners, say they actually have used the weapon for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its intended use, however, the handgun continues to be at the center 
of the most furious of firearms debates. Its opponents, if they do not argue 
for an outright ban on the handgun's sale and ownership, urge that it not be 
kept in the home. Supporters cite rising crime rates and the Second Amendment 
to the Constitution as reasons for keeping a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
And somewhere in the center falls Richard Wiedepuhl, Christian's father. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that there's nothing wrong with keeping a gun, except for an Uzi or 
something like that," says Wiedepuhl. "But people need to be trained." 
</P>
<P>
Wiedepuhl's profound grief and frustration over his son's death has not 
modified that position. Although he says tearfully that nothing can mitigate 
the sadness his family feels, he continues to believe, vehemently, that it was 
not the pistol that killed Christian, but a lack of foresight and care on the 
part of the parents of the boy handling the gun, and a lack of basic education 
on the part of the boy himself. 
</P>
<P>
"A person should have to get a permit for the gun, then go to the (range) and 
learn how to use it and then purchase the firearm. It's very dangerous, like a 
car. You don't drive a car 180 miles per hour. It's the same with firearms. You 
have the right to own them, but you have to understand how to handle them and 
secure them," Wiedepuhl says. 
</P>
<P>
That last comment is a fairly accurate summation of the party line of the NRA, 
likely the most tenacious defender of the rights of handgun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"People want the most optimum piece of (home protection) equipment for the 
money, and a firearm is going to be your best bet for that, more than a knife 
or some other device," says Tracey Martin, manager of women's issues and 
information for the NRA and a firearms instructor. "It's a lethal force, but in 
order to become proficient, there's not the investment of time that's involved 
in a martial art, for instance." 
</P>
<P>
The NRA, says Martin, does not advocate mandatory firearm training for new 
owners, but recommends such courses. It is education, she says, that "is the 
key to avoiding any type of accident. There's one hard-and-fast rule with the 
NRA, and that's that a gun should be stored so that it's inaccessible to 
untrained and unauthorized persons." 
</P>
<P>
Children, in particular, are resourceful. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how old or young a kid is, if there's a gun in the house, they're 
going to find it," says Randy Garell, president of The Grant Boys, a firearms 
retailer in Costa Mesa. "That's why we recommend that you put a trigger guard 
lock on the gun or -- and this is the first choice -- that the gun go in a lock 
box." 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, locks are not an excuse for neglecting education. 
</P>
<P>
"Children," Garell says, "should be educated at the earliest possible age how 
to shoot and how to respect firearms and what the deadly consequences are of 
their misuse. That's certainly something that isn't taught on television. In 
one scene a guy's shot and in another he gets right up. They have to know that 
this is a deadly object and that misuse of it will end their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Or the lives of others, as many police officers know. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a real fear we have," says Lt. Robert Helton, a spokesman for the Santa 
Ana Police Department, "that a loved one will be out late and will try to come 
home quietly and they might startle their own spouse in the dark. They see a 
shadow in the closet in the dark and the next thing you know, kaboom. 
</P>
<P>
"From my perspective, I would say most people (who keep handguns at home) 
become more of a hindrance than a help. When we get a call from a person in a 
residence, one of the first questions the dispatcher will ask is if they have a 
handgun in the house. We won't go in if someone has a handgun. They do get 
really pumped up in that situation, and we don't always come in through the 
front door." 
</P>
<P>
It is in just such a situation that the handgun owner's reason for keeping a 
loaded weapon in the house must crystallize into deliberate, well-planned 
action. An intruder at the bedroom door in the middle of the night presents the 
moment of ultimate truth. Such a situation is the reason the person bought the 
weapon in the first place, but no one -- not police, not firearms advocates, 
not handgun opponents and particularly not the person holding the weapon -- can 
predict whether the finger will be able to pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
The law in such situations, says Garell, is clear. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to think you or someone else is going to die," he says. "It's much 
the same for a civilian as for a peace officer: You have to be in mortal fear 
of your life with no other option, no place to hide and no place to run." 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, if the situation calls for it, you must be prepared to take a 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't pick up a gun to threaten," says Garell, "and you don't shoot to 
wound. That's great in the movies, but once you pick up that gun, you have to 
make the decision that you're prepared to use it, because if the other person 
is armed and they see that you have a gun, they're likely to shoot you." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, says Lt. Marc Hedgpeth, commander of the crimes against persons bureau 
of the Anaheim Police Department, "We're seeing a trend in that quite 
frequently the mere fact that you carry a firearm is not going to lessen the 
possibility that you'll have somebody confront you. It's not that uncommon for 
even police officers to attempt to hold a criminal suspect at gunpoint and have 
the person challenge them to shoot them or even attack them, even though the 
officer is armed." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why, say gun advocates, a handgun in the home should be the final 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
"A firearm," says the NRA's Martin, "is the last line of self-defense, after 
you've exhausted everything else." But, say Helton and others, there are many 
people who own handguns who "on a whim purchase a gun, never even fire it, take 
it home, and load it up and salt it away in the night stand." 
</P>
<P>
It is these guns, more than any others, that can end up on evidence tables in 
cases such as these: 
</P>
<P>
* A 19-year-old Santa Ana man, Jose Rojas, accidentally shot himself in the 
head and died in January, 1989, while brandishing a .357-caliber handgun 
outside his Santa Ana home. Family members and neighbors told police Rojas had 
been drinking and had been firing the gun all day. 
</P>
<P>
* Last August, 9-year-old Melissa Delfrancia was accidentally shot in the neck 
after she and her sister found a .44-caliber magnum revolver apparently left in 
their Tustin-area home by a workman. She survived. 
</P>
<P>
* Gregorio Torrez, 18, of La Habra, shot himself in the head and died last 
September while playing Russian roulette with a friend's father's .38-caliber 
revolver. 
</P>
<P>
* A Santa Ana woman, Norma Nunez, was killed last October after being shot in 
the chest by a bullet from her husband's .38-caliber revolver while he was 
cleaning the gun. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, instances in which handguns have been used successfully by 
private citizens to foil crimes: 
</P>
<P>
* Craig Tantalo of San Juan Capistrano answered his door at about 2 a.m. in 
February, 1986, and was confronted by two masked and armed men, one of whom 
shoved a pistol into his face. As he was backing up, Tantalo reached behind him 
and grabbed a 9-millimeter pistol he had forgotten to put away the night 
before, disarmed the man and shot him in the groin. The second man fled. 
</P>
<P>
* In September, 1987, 76-year-old Roy Johnson, a resident of Leisure World in 
Seal Beach, was awakened by sounds in his apartment and confronted a burglar 
with his own .22-caliber revolver. When the man advanced on him, Johnson fired, 
wounding the man in the right armpit. The burglar fled on a motorcycle but was 
captured an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
But there are no guarantees of a happy ending when bullets start to fly, says a 
spokesperson for a national anti-handgun group. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly believe people when they say that they would never use a gun on a 
member of their own family," says Marjolijn Bijlefeld, the associate director 
of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a Washington, D.C.-based educational, 
statistical and lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
"But your intentions and your behavior are not always the same, particularly if 
there are drugs or alcohol involved. If we could somehow verify that you're 
buying a gun and you're always going to be a model citizen, you're never going 
to get angry or have the wrong people over, or never have kids over, then maybe 
we could talk. But you can't verify that." 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics gathered by the coalition, the chances of using the 
weapon properly do not appear to be good. There were 140 justifiable homicides 
committed with handguns in 1988, says Bijlefeld. But there were also slightly 
more than 9,000 handgun homicides that were not justified, about 12,000 
suicides and about 1,000 unintentional shootings that were fatal. 
</P>
<P>
That last category hurts Richard Wiedepuhl most deeply because it implies, with 
antiseptic certainty, that his son's death could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't bring my son back," he says. "But I'm going to make sure that people 
realize that extreme steps must be taken. Education comes first, as soon as 
possible, and then security. Because we could become a killing society, with 
more people dying of accidents than diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a grief which I never will outlive. You never think you're going to 
outlive your own children."

A MOVABLE FEAST: COLLECTIBLE CARS ON SOUTHLAND AUCTION BLOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
For a serious car nut, there is no such thing as seeing too many collectible 
cars -- even if the nut in question can't even afford the sales tax on a 
desirable automobile. 
</P>
<P>
If you fall into this category, a very good way to spend a weekend is to attend 
an auto auction specializing in collectible cars. They're movable feasts for 
auto aficionados -- and you don't have to buy anything other than a $5 to $7 
entry ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, since auctions often are held in such vacation places as Newport 
Beach, Monterey, Palm Springs and San Diego, you can combine your car hobby and 
a weekend jaunt. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland is home base of two major firms catering to the car collector: 
Rick Cole Auctions of North Hollywood and Spectrum Auction Co. in Moorpark. 
Spectrum's next Southland auction will be held June 23 and 24 at the Marriott 
Hotel in Woodland Hills. Rick Cole Auctions will hold its next Southland 
auction July 7-8 at the Hyatt-Newporter Resort in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For auctions outside California, check Hemmings Motor News magazine, the bible 
of car collectors, available at larger newsstands or bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
Spectrum is headed by Drew Donen and Kurt Hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"I made plenty of money as a stockbroker, but it wasn't fun anymore," Donen 
said. "That's when I decided to get into the car auctioning business with my 
friend, Kurt Hazard, who started the Car Bazaar at Devonshire Downs near Cal 
State Northridge back in 1977." 
</P>
<P>
Their first auction in 1984 brought the partners $186,000 from 517 cars sold. 
Now they hold about 10 auctions a year in Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Diego, 
Los Angeles, Woodland Hills, Irvine/Newport Beach, the San Francisco Bay area 
and Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Collector auctions typically are held on weekends, with sellers bringing their 
cars in Friday nights. Some auctions are held on Fridays or Saturdays, but when 
the auction takes place over the entire weekend, cars usually are put on the 
block Saturday and Sunday, beginning about 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I visited both a Cole's auction in Universal City, and a Spectrum 
auction at Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Cars on display ran the gamut from antiques like brass radiator Model-T Fords 
and a chain-driven 1907 Buick touring car, to gems of the classic era like 
Packards, Chryslers, V-16 Cadillacs and Lincolns, to cars of the 1940s, '50s 
and '60s such as Mercury and Ford convertibles, Chevy Nomads, a 1949 Packard 
wood-bodied (woodie) station wagon, the classic two-seat Ford Thunderbird of 
1955-57, Pontiac GTOs and Oldsmobile 442s. 
</P>
<P>
Sports cars included Corvettes of the 1953-67 era, the prime collectibles of 
the most popular U.S. sports cars, plus the full range of British, German and 
Italian marques. There was even a rare Citroen DS-19 convertible. 
</P>
<P>
Muscle cars of the late 1960s and early '70s -- Dodge Chargers, Camaro Z28s, 
Pontiac GTOs, Oldsmobile 442s -- are in demand these days by baby boomers who 
remember these cars from their "Wonder Years," Rick Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese cars are rarely on view at auctions, said Kurt Hazard, because only a 
few are considered collectible. But an early 1970s Datsun 240Z in prime 
condition is a good collectible car from Japan, he added, and the prices are 
relatively low. Toyota's GT 2000 sports car from the 1960s is also very 
collectible, but very rare. 
</P>
<P>
While Japanese cars are rare, Japanese and German and British buyers are not, 
Hazard said. Japanese buyers love Mercedeses and BMWs and Porsches -- anything 
collectible as long as it's German, he said. Japanese collectors, usually 
through American agents, also love American cars of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
German buyers gravitate toward American muscle cars, prime-era Corvettes and 
luxury British cars, Hazard said, while British collectors appear to be 
repatriating many of their cars from the colonies to the mother country. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Hazard, the massive collector-car price run-up of the 1980s has 
slowed down considerably, with "steady prices and some fluctuation." 
</P>
<P>
A good way to get the most out of an auction is to arrive early, between 9 and 
10 a.m., and admire the cars on display in the staging area. Quite often, you 
can chat with owners and ask them why they're selling their gems. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent Cole auction, the owner of a pristine 1940 Mercury convertible told 
me he'd let it go for as little as $15,000 because he'd just bought a 1939 
Mercury convertible (the first year for Mercury). His wife, he said, told him 
to limit himself to one Mercury at a time. 
</P>
<P>
At a Spectrum auction, I chatted with the owner of a two-tone gray 1941 
Cadillac sedan that was selling for $14,000 to $16,000. The Cadillac's back 
seat allowed plenty of leg and head room for its 6-foot-4 owner. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the auction tent, you don't have to worry about making the wrong 
hand signals and inadvertently buying a Duesenberg. Collectors have to register 
to bid on the cars being auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
The word reserve will be used at the auto auction. It simply means the lowest 
amount the consignee (car owner) will take for the vehicle. If the bidding 
stops at $13,500, say, and the reserve is $15,000, the car won't sell unless 
the consignee agrees to remove the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Cars that don't sell at auction are driven back to the lot viewing area, where 
any well-heeled car nut still interested in buying can negotiate with the 
owner. 
</P>

INTO THE NIGHT: X-RATED ANTICS AT AIDS BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: The party after Tuesday's premiere of "Without You I'm Nothing" held 
at Bar One in West Hollywood. The film was a record of comedienne Sandra 
Bernhard's one-woman Broadway show, and the evening was a benefit for the 
American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
The Entertainment: X-rated antics from a troupe of transvestites, emceed by New 
York cable TV star Robin Byrd, who wore a backless (and we mean backless) 
cowgirl outfit. Chichi LaRue kicked off the fun by lip-syncing to the song 
"Nasty," during which LaRue grabbed 15-year-old Drew Barrymore from the 
audience. Bernhard cheered the whole thing and even dirty-danced with Robin 
Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Director John Boskovich, designer Isaac Mizrahi (who designed 
Bernhard's lipstick-red dress), singer John Doe, sculptor Julian Schnabel, 
writer Bruce Vilanch, actress Theresa Russell with husband Nicolas Roeg, 
professional gossips the Hollywood Kids, artist Allee Willis, and actress Kim 
McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Bernhard's floor-length red Mizrahi dress made her look like 
Cinderella's wicked stepmother. The other woman wore streetwalker chic, while 
the guys who weren't wearing dresses wore leather jackets and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Fresh shrimp, antipasto, pate, and hot pasta. The guests attacked the 
buffet like the zombies in "Night of the Living Dead." 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: The evening raised $50,000 for the group, according to AMFAR 
president Mervyn Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
Noted: As observed in this space before, the '70s are back. Guests wore vinyl 
shorts, tank tops, dog tags, and even sequined tube tops. The deejay had the 
nerve to play that ultra '70s hit, "One Tin Soldier" by Coven. The crowd showed 
admirable restraint by not wearing bell bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "Remember, if you don't have a loved one at home, you always have us!" 
screamed Bernhard and Byrd to the appreciative crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Sandra Bernhard is not your average Hollywood actress, and this was 
definitely not your average Hollywood premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: One woman who approached the buffet was told, "You can't have any 
shrimp until 9:30!" That was rude -- almost as rude as adult film star Angel 
Kelly, who took everything off as the mixed crowd screamed and whistled. As we 
said, it was not your average Hollywood premiere.

PARTY POLITICS REIGNED AT BASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I told Bill Press that if they gassed this place, the Democratic party would 
lose all its funds for the next 10 years," said Richard Walden, president of 
Operation California. 
</P>
<P>
The event was a 70th birthday party for Stanley K. Sheinbaum, a bearded, 
bow-tied, gray-haired eminence with a lot of friends. A former University of 
California regent and a card-carrying chair emeritus of the ACLU, among his 
many affiliations, Sheinbaum is known as a champion of human rights and 
politically liberal causes. 
</P>
<P>
True to form, Tuesday night's festivities inside a hangar at the Santa Monica 
Air Center were also a fund-raiser for Human Rights Watch, an organization 
Sheinbaum founded that monitors human rights practices of governments. 
</P>
<P>
Preceded by a bevy of dancers, the birthday boy made a dashing (though shaky) 
entrance on a yellow World War II fighter plane. A number of guests commented 
that an airplane was an appropriate vehicle considering the amount of time 
Sheinbaum spends on planes in pursuit of his human rights activities. (Last 
week he met with Nelson Mandela in Geneva). 
</P>
<P>
On hand were politicians, celebrities and political celebrities, from Daniel 
Ellsberg to Margaret Papandreou, Tom Hayden to Jane Fonda (sitting separately), 
former Gov. Jerry Brown to Norman Lear. Plus: Stanley's wife, Betty; Atty. Gen. 
John Van de Kamp; Jack Lemmon; Gregory Peck; Sydney Pollack; Mayor Tom Bradley; 
Cybill Shepherd; Danny Goldberg; Richard Dreyfuss; Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, 
and City Council members Ruth Galanter and Nate Holden; Victor Navasky, editor 
of the Nation, and Aryeh Neier, executive director of Human Rights Watch. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who wasn't famous was what someone described as being among the group 
of quiet, anonymous donors who keep liberal causes alive. 
</P>
<P>
Observed by Norman Lear: "Wet people are here, people who hug easy and a lot. 
Dry people are flaky and brittle, and their bones fall off if your hug them. 
And this is a wet crowd. If you know Stanley a little, you know he's a moist 
one." 
</P>
<P>
The conversation ran to post-primary politics and politicking, and included an 
outpouring of sympathy for Van de Kamp, who table-hopped relentlessly; Dianne 
Feinstein's quota system; Jerry Brown's eye on the Senate, and, looking into 
the future, who would be L.A.'s next mayor. "Everybody on the city council is 
running for mayor," remarked someone knowingly.

<P>
TELEVISION: TOP STARS AT THE NETWORK'S ANNUAL AFFILIATES' GATHERING FACE AN 
AWKWARD QUESTION: WHY DID MARLA MAPLES RATINGS BEAT THE BERLIN WALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At its annual affiliates convention here Wednesday, ABC hauled out its glittery 
array of news stars -- Peter Jennings, David Brinkley, Barbara Walters, Ted 
Koppel and Sam Donaldson, with Diane Sawyer live by remote from New York. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about freedom around the world, flag burning, poverty and other big 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
But then they invited questions from the audience of about 1,200 station 
executives in the Century Plaza ballroom. And Steve Kimtian of WKBW-TV in 
Buffalo asked a stinger: What did it mean to this panel of "the world's best 
journalists" that "PrimeTime Live" got its highest ratings for the program that 
featured an interview with Marla Maples, Donald Trump's model friend? 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer, just back from Moscow, where she was interviewing KGB officials for a 
future program, seemed to blanch. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it doesn't surprise me," she said. "I mean, you all know what Marla 
Maples is all about. It's about national soap opera, an irresistible slice of 
American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what is more confounding, concerning something on the other 
end," she said, deflecting the question. "Namely, why did viewers turn away in 
droves from coverage of the Berlin Wall coming down?" 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson, her co-host on 'PrimeTime Live,' noted, "We had the highest share on 
'PrimeTime Live' to date, with a 26 share, with Marla Maples. Our lowest share 
to date was the night when the wall came down, and we mobilized (a special) and 
it was pretty good -- I'm real proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a lesson to be learned here, Donaldson said, he hoped that ABC 
executives wouldn't learn it. He said, metaphorically, that when the wall comes 
down again, he wants ABC to do the same kind of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings said that 'World News Tonight' ratings "held up pretty well" the week 
of the Berlin Wall events. 
</P>
<P>
Walters put in, "Diane did Marla. I can be holier than thou, folks, but I did 
Donna Rice. (It was) the same interview." 
</P>
<P>
The audience broke up in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Walters said that in 15 years on ABC, she has tried to mix interviews with 
celebrities and heads of state "for my own sanity." 
</P>
<P>
Koppel tried to insert a comment, but Walters countered that on Tuesday night 
he had done a Tom Cruise interview on "Nightline" for a segment on summer 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
Again, affiliate laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Koppel recovered: "Before we get carried away with too much sackcloth and 
ashes, by and large the kind of programming you get from the network news 
provides you with the opportunity to program for ratings the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
As a capper to the session, former President Ronald Reagan came in to chat with 
Walters about his recent meeting with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC affiliates, meeting through today, seemed in a cheery mood. Network 
programming is generally edging up in the ratings and the fall prime-time 
schedule is considered promising. 
</P>
<P>
But worse times were recalled by Thomas Murphy, who recently retired as chief 
executive officer of Capital Cities/ABC. When the two companies merged 4 1/2 
years ago, ABC was running 4-plus ratings points behind NBC in prime time. The 
merger narrowed the gap to 1.7 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
This was Murphy's last affiliates meeting. He was given a tribute that included 
pictures from his childhood through his executive tenure, set to emotional 
music. The affiliates gave him a standing ovation.

THE DOOLITTLE: 'JEROME ROBBINS' BROADWAY' AT THE SHUBERT IS THE FIRST AHMANSON 
SUBSCRIPTION ENTRY. THEN IT'S 'HEIDI,' NOEL, STEVE AND ALAN IN HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Revivals of Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music," with Lee Remick, and 
Noel Coward's "The Vortex" will play the Doolittle Theatre next year, joining 
three previously reported shows -- "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," "The Heidi 
Chronicles" and "Henceforward . . . " -- to make up the Center Theatre Group's 
1990-91 Ahmanson-at-the-Doolittle season. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the CTG's other wing, the Mark Taper Forum, will open its season in 
September with "Hope of the Heart" -- a dramatization of Chapter Four of Robert 
Penn Warren's "All the King's Men." And Taper subscribers also will be offered 
priority tickets to "The Dragons' Trilogy," an import from Quebec's Theatre 
Repere, which will play UCLA'S Freud Theatre as part of the Los Angeles 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson season was announced by producing director Gordon Davidson. But 
Davidson, who doubles as artistic director/producer of the Taper, declined to 
comment on the Taper shows, citing an official announcement of the Taper season 
he plans to make next week. The Taper information was obtained from sources 
available to Taper subscribers and confirmed by some of the people involved in 
the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Ahmanson season will again take place at the Doolittle Theatre in 
Hollywood, while the Ahmanson itself is occupied by "The Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
But the first entry in the Ahmanson season, "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," is the 
one show that will not be at the Doolittle. It will open at the Shubert Theatre 
in Century City Oct. 7 and play through Feb. 23 or 24 (the exact closing date 
depends on the logistics of the show's move to its next stop, Japan, said 
co-producer Roger Berlind). "Broadway" was initially announced to open here 
last November, as part of the current Ahmanson season. Then it was postponed 
until May, 1991 -- and the tour was scheduled to open in Boston this October. 
Now Los Angeles has replaced Boston as the first stop on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson said he applied pressure on the "Broadway" producers to set a Los 
Angeles date -- "I didn't want to tell the subscribers 'maybe' " -- but not 
necessarily to move Los Angeles ahead of Boston on the itinerary. But he's 
happy that "we'll get a fresh, first-class production which won't go through 
the pains of being cut down for touring." There will be "a few (less) people" 
in this production than in New York, where the show closes Sept. 1, "but not 
many." 
</P>
<P>
("Broadway" dislodged "City of Angels" from an October date at the Shubert, but 
"City" is now tentatively expected at the Shubert following "Broadway" -- 
"depending on ('City' director) Michael Blakemore's availability, which depends 
on a movie he's making," said Berlind, a co-producer of both shows. Davidson 
said Ahmanson subscribers would also "have first crack" at "City of Angels" 
tickets -- either as a bonus for this season or as a regular part of next 
season's package, depending on when the show opens.) 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Wasserstein's "The Heidi Chronicles" will play the Doolittle Oct. 11-Dec. 
23. This is a switch from a previously reported spring date for the comedy 
about the effects of the women's movement on an art history professor. Davidson 
said Los Angeles was moved from the "back end" to the beginning of the Tony- 
and Pulitzer-winning play's national tour. 
</P>
<P>
In his 1924 play "The Vortex," about the twin addictions of a high-society 
mother and son, Noel Coward became "the hottest theatrical property in town," 
according to critic Sheridan Morley. At a London revival last year, Davidson 
was "knocked out by its physical beauty and its extreme contemporaneousness," 
and he has scheduled a Doolittle production for Jan. 17-March 31. Robert Allan 
Ackerman will direct, and the show will use Philip Prowse's design, prepared 
for the British production Davidson saw. The British producers will share the 
production credit, but the show will be cast here. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson will direct "A Little Night Music" at the Doolittle for an April 
18-June 30 run. "It's my piece de resistance, I hope," said Davidson. "The 
music will be great in the Doolittle, unamplified." Sondheim will advise, but 
no rewrites are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Ayckbourn's "Henceforward . . ." had been scheduled for the current 
season, but Davidson postponed it in February, saying he couldn't get the 
(unnamed) actor he wanted. It's been moved to the end of next season, though 
Davidson is still not sure he'll get his man -- "it's so far away, I won't get 
a reasonable commitment" until around "the first of the year," he said. "I 
would try not to postpone it again." Davidson was going to direct "Henceforward 
. . . " but now isn't sure, because of the consecutive scheduling of "Night 
Music" and the Ayckbourn play. "I doubt if I'll do two in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson also discussed a few shows that won't be at the Doolittle. "The 
(Doolittle's) thousand seats are a little too small, economically, for booked 
shows, as opposed to the ones we produce ourselves. And the orchestra (seating) 
is so small. With 1,200 seats and a slightly larger orchestra, we could swing 
shows like 'Sarafina,' 'M. Butterfly' and 'Largely New York.' " 
</P>
<P>
The producers of these shows wanted to bring them to the Doolittle, said 
Davidson -- and he wanted them to come. But ultimately the potential returns on 
the investments were deemed too low.

THE TAPER: 'HOPE OF THE HEART' KICKS OFF THE SEASON IN SEPTEMBER. THE SCHEDULE 
ALSO FEATURES 'THE LISBON TRAVIATA,' 'THE WASH,' 'MR. JELLYLORD' AND 'WIDOWS."

Taper subscribers have been told they will receive priority seating for the 23 
performances of "The Dragons Trilogy" ("La Trilogie des Dragons") at UCLA's 
Freud Theatre, Sept. 14-Oct. 14. The production covers a 25-year time span in 
Quebec City's Chinatown -- hence the connection to the Pacific Rim theme of the 
Los Angeles Festival. It won first prize at the Theater of the Americas 1987 
Festival and also won top awards from Canadian critics' circles. 
</P>
<P>
The Taper's regular season will begin in September with "Hope of the Heart." 
Director Adrian Hall had hoped -- in his heart -- to be able to present his 
earlier adaptation of the rest of "All the King's Men" along with this 
adaptation of the book's Chapter Four -- in a two-evening package. Asked if 
Davidson felt it was beyond the Taper's resources to do both shows, Hall 
laughed and replied, "I think he felt it was beyond my resources." In a mailing 
to Taper subscribers, "Hope" is described as a "journey into the pre-Civil War 
heritage of a young reporter, who uncovers the past of a distant relative, Cass 
Mastern, and his wild, horrifying and disastrous affair with a plantation 
owner's wife." 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, Terrence McNally's "The Lisbon Traviata" is expected to 
occupy the next slot on the Taper season, opening in November. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Kan Gotanda's "The Wash" is the likeliest candidate for the January slot 
in the season. An examination of an elderly Japanese-American couple's divorce 
and its aftermath, "The Wash" is slated to be directed by Berkeley Repertory 
Theatre artistic director Sharon Ott -- first at the Manhattan Theatre Club in 
October and then at the Taper in early 1991. The play has been through several 
Taper workshops, including one that was reviewed in 1985, but the official 
premiere was at San Francisco's Eureka Theatre in 1987. A film version received 
a limited release in 1988 and was seen on PBS' "American Playhouse" in March. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Jellylord," the musical about Jelly Roll Morton, for which the Taper 
recently received a $100,000 grant, will probably occupy the next slot, opening 
in March, though there is some uncertainty about the order of "The Wash" and 
"Mr. Jellylord." 
</P>
<P>
The Taper has promised subscribers "the first look" at an American production 
of a classic play in late spring, before it is dispatched to the United Kingdom 
as part of an exchange agreement with Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Theatre 
Company, which brought "King Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to the Taper 
earlier this year. "Julius Caesar" is the expected choice. 
</P>
<P>
The season's last slot probably will be occupied by "Widows," Chilean writer 
Ariel Dorfman's play about resistance to a brutal military dictatorship. 
Originally scheduled to be running right now, the play was pulled from the 
current season for more rewriting, despite Dorfman's stated belief that it had 
been ready to go into production. By phone, Dorfman said he and the Taper now 
"seem to be in agreement. I think we'll find the right text." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier mailing to subscribers, Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" also 
was described as "set for the (1990-91) season." But now it looks as if the 
two-part epic won't receive its first full production, at Eureka Theatre in San 
Francisco, until next May at the earliest, which would probably postpone its 
appearance at the Taper until the following season. The first half of the show, 
"Millennium Approaches," recently closed at Taper, Too, but the second half, 
"Perestroika," is still being developed and may go through a Taper workshop 
next fall. Don Shirley

'NASTY': SAN ANTONIO POLICE WARN RECORD STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police in San Antonio, Tex., have started warning record store retailers that 
they could face obscenity charges for selling the controversial album "As Nasty 
as They Wanna Be" by the rap group 2 Live Crew. As a result of the warning, 
several independent record store owners and at least one major chain have 
removed the album from their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
The move follows last week's ruling in Florida by U.S. Dist. Judge Jose 
Gonzalez who found the album obscene under that state's law and his 
interpretation of a 1973 Supreme Court decision. On Sunday, two 2 Live Crew 
members were arrested on obscenity charges after performing the banned lyrics 
at an adults-only nightclub concert. Two days earlier, a record store owner in 
Hollywood, Fla., was arrested on an obscenity charge for selling the album. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lt. Jerry Pittman, commander of the San Antonio vice squad, said 
Wednesday that police there were not cracking down on retailers or threatening 
them with arrest. "We're merely going by the locations and providing them with 
a transcript of the lyrics of the album," Pittman said. "We did not tell them 
to remove the album from the shelves. That would be a violation of First 
Amendment rights and prior restraint." 
</P>
<P>
Under current Texas obscenity statutes, retailers must be aware of the contents 
of the material they are selling before they can be charged with a violation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the complaints from parents keep coming in, then police will begin 
conducting undercover investigations and undercover buys," Pittman said. "We 
will take the tape to a judge, and if a judge determines that the material is 
obscene, then the clerk will be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to approach this as reasonably as possible," he added. "We would 
rather do this than subject cashiers, many of whom are teens or high school 
kids, to arrest." 
</P>
<P>
But some retailers took the police action as a direct threat to get the albums 
off their shelves or face prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings Records and Tapes, a chain of 120 stores in Texas and 14 surrounding 
states, removed the album from its stores. "We're not going to put our managers 
or associates in jeopardy," said Walter McNeer, vice president of Hastings. 
"We're going to follow the law, whatever the law is." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was unhappy with the decision. "I'm concerned, because 
adults should have a choice," he said. "We've restricted sale of the album to 
anyone under 18." 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the possibility of prosecution) basically stinks," said Dave Risher, 
owner of Hogwild Records, which is located across the street from San Antonio 
College. Risher said he was visited by vice officers Tuesday who asked him to 
voluntarily remove the album. "I don't think the vice squad is operating within 
their rights." 
</P>
<P>
As far as selling the album, Risher said the issue was moot: "I'm out of stock. 
I sold my one copy to a TV station. But I'm leaning toward selling it if I get 
more copies." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Regur, owner of J.R.'s Record Exchange, also was defiant. "I don't feel 
that individuals complaining to the police can tell me or any owner of a record 
store what they can or cannot sell, especially when it comes to adults. I can't 
listen and be responsible for every track on every album in my store." 
</P>
<P>
But Pittman said most store owners were willingly removing the album. "When 
they read the transcripts, they were appalled over the language," he said. "The 
response was positive. They said it was nothing but garbage." 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for conviction of selling obscene material in Texas can be 
up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.

Baseball cap, crown, turban, bonnet or cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
Donning different headgear can trigger a whole new way to act. And switching 
hats -- and roles -- is part of the fun this summer at the Ventura College 
Teenage Drama/ Musical Comedy Workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's meant to be an experience and fun, but fun with a structure," said Jay 
Varela, who with Gary Mascaro will direct the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Varela, whose long list of TV, film and theater credits includes "Dallas," 
"Falcon Crest" and "Cagney and Lacey," currently teaches at Ventura College. He 
outlined plans for the jampacked week that includes dance, mime, improvisation, 
vocal exercises and dramatic and musical-comedy scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Just like professional actors, youngsters will begin with daily warm-up -- 
breathing and stretching and free movement to music that says Varela "gets them 
into the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Theater games will focus on what kids do in life. When teen-agers dress all in 
black or dye their hair they are testing a new way to be, Varela said. "Through 
observing, they naturally rehearse and try on different characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
So with a hat or a pair of shoes, a cape or a stick, a youngster can slip on a 
whole new personality and strut, slouch, stagger or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
Mornings also will involve mime or improvisation. Mascaro will share his 
expertise in choreography gained during a long theater career that includes the 
work he is presently doing with the Improvisational Theater Project at the Mark 
Taper Forum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under Mascaro's supervision youngsters will grasp sticks or wooden dowels to 
learn swordplay. Shakespearean scenes such as Romeo and Tybalt's fight in 
"Romeo and Juliet" or Lysander and Demetrius' comic fight in "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream" will be acted out. And Mascaro will lead dance ensembles from 
"Guys and Dolls," "Carousel" and "Oklahoma!" 
</P>
<P>
Puppet improvisation is another technique. "If they're having a problem with a 
character, you give them a puppet," said Varela. "Once they get the puppet," he 
said, it "has the freedom to do the character." 
</P>
<P>
Breathing exercises, singing, verse work and diction will be taught by Linda 
Fern Fay, the workshop's musical director who is a music teacher at Oxnard 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Students "will explore their voices," Fay said. "Those that are inexperienced 
will be able to find their range. We'll do breathing to hit the higher or lower 
notes." 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, students will work toward a recital scheduled for the final 
afternoon of the workshop. Auditions will be held June 25, and depending on the 
talent and age of participants, the scenes for the performance will be 
selected.

<P>
Varela chooses material that he feels is appropriate to the participant's age. 
"There are wonderful works such as Maurice Sendak's 'The Wild Things' that 
respect the fears and respect the perspectives the child really has and doesn't 
think they're foolish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For older teen-agers Varela has material written by 14- and 15-year-olds as 
part of the Humana Festival of New American Plays in Louisville, Ky. These deal 
with the realities of dysfunctional families, alcoholism or awakening sexual 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
In working on scenes, Varela takes a very physical, graphic approach to help 
youngsters find their own way of expressing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene where two people are arguing, he asks the players to tell him what 
kinds of feelings their characters have, and to describe what, if any, weapons 
they might be holding. One youngster might say that his character is acting 
mean like he has boxing gloves. The other could say that her character is 
pretty easygoing and seems like she has a pillow. So she is given a pillow 
while he is asked to fake punches. 
</P>
<P>
Now, said Varela, they're really engaged with each other, "because if they're 
not, they'll be bopped in the jaw." He added that no one gets hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Workshop participants, who range from age 10 through 18, will be divided into 
age groups for some work. At other times an older student will act as a mentor 
for a younger one. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best ways to learn," Varela said, "is to teach." 
</P>
<P>
At least two counselors will also be on staff. They are Ventura College theater 
students who have acting training and experience. 
</P>
<P>
Some youngsters will be invited to participate in the chorus of "The 
Fantasticks," the musical the Theater Department is presenting this summer. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the workshop is being offered. Varela decided to 
initiate it after he traveled to Rhode Island with the Improvisational Theater 
Project. He found throughout the Northeast that there is a tremendous 
investment in youth theater, and he decided the time was right to "create 
something here." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very active camp," Varela said. "Hopefully, when the kids get home, 
they'll be pooped and their parents will be happy." 
</P>
<P>
* THE DETAILS: Teenage Drama/Musical Comedy Workshop is for young people 
entering grades six through 12. It runs Monday, June 25, to Friday, June 29, 
9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Registration fee is $100. Participants should bring a 
cassette recorder and lunch, drinks are provided; wear sweats or clothes to 
move in and sturdy shoes. Youngsters with disabilities will be accommodated. 
The workshop is held in the Ventura College theater building. For more 
information, call Ventura College Community Services, 654-6459.

TRAILER OFFERING HOMELESS AID IS PARKED IN HOLLYWOOD UNTIL JULY 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city-funded mobile trailer that takes a variety of government and private 
services to the homeless has set up shop in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Mobile Ombudsman Program, which ferries a group of care 
providers around the city in a trailer, will be at 4759 Hollywood Blvd., in a 
parking lot behind the Hollywood Mental Health Program until July 6, when it 
will move to another location. 
</P>
<P>
In the trailer, a mix of federal, state and local officials and private care 
providers try to link the homeless with a wide range of services they might 
need, such as access to veterans benefits, employment development and Social 
Security funds, legal services, health and mental health care, and drug abuse 
and AIDS counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The ombudsman program, using $110,000 in city funds, tries to nudge the 
homeless off the streets by finding them aid and programs that can help them 
get their lives back in order and find jobs and housing, according to Patricia 
Huff, a senior management analyst for the Community Development Department who 
coordinates the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically have every social service that is needed right inside the trailer 
and we bring it directly to the homeless instead of waiting for them to come to 
us," Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can expedite services, so they don't have to wait in welfare lines, and, in 
fact, can reasonably walk away with shelter and food stamps in one visit," Huff 
said. "It is like one-stop shopping." 
</P>
<P>
The staff of about 10 employees and some volunteers greets the men and women 
that come to the trailer and guides them through the otherwise tedious and 
confusing process of traveling from aid office to office and line to line to 
determine what services they need, what they are eligible for and where they 
can obtain help. 
</P>
<P>
Program employees use city vans to shuttle the homeless to and from the trailer 
to job interviews, welfare appointments, hospital appointments and other 
errands, and to take homeless people to the trailer itself for aid. 
</P>
<P>
"It deals with one of the most obvious social problems in Hollywood," said City 
Councilman Michael Woo, who represents Hollywood, an area frequented by 
transients and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a great example of getting bureaucracies to work together, and for those 
(homeless) willing to help themselves, it is a real godsend." 
</P>
<P>
The trailer has served the homeless in Venice, Wilmington, Van Nuys and other 
sites.

2 BILLS WOULD GIVE COASTAL PANEL CLOUT 
</P>

<P>
The California Coastal Commission would receive broad new enforcement powers to 
stop illegal development along the coast under two bills approved earlier this 
week by the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), would 
give the commission authority to fine violators up to $10,000 per day and to 
issue cease-and-desist orders. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials have complained that they are virtually powerless to halt 
unauthorized building. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make the cost high enough that people have second thoughts about 
illegal building on the coastline," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation will now go to the Assembly for consideration. If the Assembly 
passes the bill, it faces an uncertain future before Gov. George Deukmejian. 
Although the governor has not yet taken a stand on the bills, he vetoed a less 
punitive version of coastal protection legislation introduced last year by 
state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia). 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Commission is pursuing more than 600 violations of the coastal 
protection laws -- more than half in Orange and Los Angeles counties. However, 
commission officials have said they are not equipped to punish violators. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has just one enforcement officer and must rely largely on 
neighbors' reports to discover illegal development. 
</P>
<P>
When it does find such development, the panel's only recourse is to sue the 
offenders in often-lengthy court proceedings. Unlike other state agencies, it 
does not have the power to levy punishment. 
</P>
<P>
One of Rosenthal's bills, approved in a 21-12 vote, would require the panel to 
implement a "comprehensive enforcement plan" to stop illegal development. The 
other measure -- passed, 23-8 -- would allow the commission to levy fines 
against violators and issue cease-and-desist orders.

POLICE CHIEF CALLS FOR MORE SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, editorials, public comments and complaints have blamed the increase 
in crime in Long Beach on the (police) union and its slowdown, officers 
neglecting their duty, the chief of police, the mayor, the City Council and a 
myriad of other entities. The truth is, crime is up. There is a dramatic 
increase in gangs, drugs and violence, not only in Long Beach but throughout 
the United States. In Los Angeles, crime per thousand is higher than ours. 
Crime is a problem throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The causes of crime are generally related to jobs, job training, education, 
reading ability of students and classroom sizes, one-parent families, lack of 
discipline in the family or the simple matter of parents not paying enough 
attention to their kids, recreation, the economy and narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Police Department has been involved in serious labor conflicts 
for the last 10 to 15 years, but this is no news. The citizens have been able 
to watch this for over a decade. Currently, it appears as if there is a first 
real potential of peace with labor in this decade. I am convinced that labor 
and our management team really want peace and to work toward better policing in 
the city. Perhaps the negative press could be redirected at some of the 
positive, hard-working police personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The organization really has been neglected because of years of union-management 
conflict. Three years ago there was no crime analysis unit or organized 
analysis of crime to tell police officers where to deploy. There was no 
planning and research unit or audit unit. SWAT team weapons were obtained from 
suspects on the streets and not allocated through a budget process. Narcotics 
officers' vehicles were in a state of disrepair to the extent they would not 
start or gain speed to pursue suspects. Detectives, traffic, patrol and 
communications personnel were understaffed. The department manual was last 
revised in 1977, until the recent 1988 revision. The first weapons inventory in 
the history of the department disclosed that seven machine guns were missing, 
in addition to other things. Training was negligible. There was a policy that 
the organization could not train with the FBI or some of the adjoining 
agencies. The crime lab was, and still is, approximately 20 years behind 
contemporary police laboratories. The training academy suffered from a lack of 
resources and equipment to keep up with contemporary law enforcement 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
I must say, for the last three years there has been unprecedented support from 
the city manager, the mayor and the majority of the City Council for unlimited 
training, the acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment, computers, weapons, 
car phones, radios, new vehicles for patrol officers, a crime analysis system, 
shooting simulators to train officers, a doubling of the motorcycle squad, an 
increase in patrol officers and clerical staff for the organization. In the 
last two years, the city manager and City Council have supported not only the 
budget process, but spending for street policing that significantly exceeded 
our allocated budget. There has been unprecedented support for "uniformed 
policing" for the streets and calls for service. However, the organization 
needs more police officers now and more resources. 
</P>
<P>
Most citizens are aware that for the last couple of months, and currently 
through the first of July, about 10% of our work force is working 16-hour days 
and on their days off. Recently, detectives have been assigned to work Sundays 
to try and keep up with crime and violence on the streets. It's very difficult 
on the officers and their families. They can't continue to do this much longer. 
The majority of the Long Beach Police Department consists of the finest law 
enforcement officers anywhere in the nation. They work hard, are conscientious, 
committed to public service, and they need your support. 
</P>
<P>
We have a hard-working, professional group of law enforcement personnel 
dedicated to public service. To the press and the authors of negative letters 
to the editor, get off your rears and replace your criticism with some effort 
to support and work with the Police Department. Voters have decided not to fund 
additional police officers by rejecting Proposition E on the June 5 ballot. I 
regret that the funding for additional police officers has not occurred, as the 
"light at the end of the tunnel" has been extinguished for now. Our dedicated 
civilian and sworn personnel will continue to perform to the best of their 
ability and will provide the most professional service possible.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Free Mail for Members 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 161 to 208, House members refused to appropriate an additional $25 
million to cover postage for their mailings back home this election year. The 
money was sought because the House is expected to spend nearly twice the $44.5 
million already appropriated for its franked mail in fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House sent a $4.4-billion spending bill (HR 4404) to 
the Senate. It showed members becoming increasingly sensitive to charges that 
they abuse the franking privilege. But it will have little practical effect 
because the Postal Service is required by law to deliver congressional mail 
even when appropriations for postage have run out. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) said, "We are not seeing an excessive use of 
the frank" given the increased cost of processing constituent mail. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said House members have become "addicted to 
free mail and maybe become franking junkies." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported more appropriations for House members' postage.

Aid to El Salvador 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 175 to 243, the House rejected a Republican plan that was the 
softer of two proposed cuts in U.S. military aid to the rightist government of 
El Salvador. The GOP proposal would have cut 25% from the Administration's 
fiscal 1990 aid request of $85 million if leftist rebels in the Salvadoran 
civil war took certain steps toward peace and other conditions were met. 
</P>
<P>
The House then approved a Democratic plan to halve the $85 million. But that 
50% cut was later voided, clearing the way for El Salvador to receive the full 
$85 million. The foreign aid bill under debate was HR 4636. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor William S. Broomfield (R-Mich.) called his amendment "a measured and 
balanced approach to the situation in El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) said the amendment dealt too lightly with 
human rights abuses by Salvadoran soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was for the softer of two proposed cuts in military aid to El 
Salvador.

Rights of the Disabled 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 148 to 266, the House refused to exempt communities of less than 
200,000 population from a requirement that virtually all newly acquired 
municipal buses in America be equipped with wheelchair lifts. Affected cities 
and towns could have gained the exemption by providing special transportation 
approved in advance by the local disabled community. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House sent to conference with the Senate a measure (HR 
2273) to protect the rights of the disabled at work and in their use of public 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Don J. Pease (D-Ohio) said the wheelchair-lift requirement works a 
financial hardship on struggling transit systems in smaller communities. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose) said, "A civil right to equal 
transportation does not diminish according to a city's population." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the exemption for smaller communities.

BY OPERATING ITS OWN BOAT OUT OF VENTURA, A GEM OF A RESTAURANT IN OJAI HAS ITS

<P>
When Sea Fresh Seafood opened four years ago, it was so small the counter and 
the fish display case took up most of the room. As I remember, there was only 
one table. The food came on paper plates. 
</P>
<P>
And everything was as fresh as a dip in a mountain stream. It was the kind of 
place where the owners made you feel both that you must have been very clever 
to have discovered it and that your arrival had made their day. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, we were not the only ones to discover the little seafood gem 
of Ojai. Soon the restaurant was such a success that they took over the ice 
cream and video store next door, remodeled it in ship-shape blue and white and 
put in lots of wooden booths and outdoor tables. They opened a branch in 
Ventura. They even added a sushi bar. 
</P>
<P>
A sushi bar in the middle of the hot, landlocked Ojai Valley? Fear not. The 
owners of Sea Fresh operate their own commercial fishing boat out of Ventura 
Harbor and have the pick of their own fresh fish. (Though all the sushi is 
fresh, not all the fish is local; it's a good idea to check with the waitress.) 
</P>
<P>
On a recent visit to the restaurant, we took three of my daughter's high school 
friends. I would have shuddered had I known that they were going to feast on 
sushi and then follow it up with a tableful of fried fish. But the dinner, like 
all of our meals at Sea Fresh, was fine. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I love taking teen-agers out to dinner. "Is your sushi reliable?" 
one of them asked our waitress. Another tried to get her friend to try tofu for 
the first time, from the fairly standard (but appealingly hot) miso soup. She 
succeeded in ramming it down her victim's throat and then complained, "No fair, 
you entirely bypassed your taste buds!" 
</P>
<P>
A great big platter of assorted sushi made a good appetizer for everyone 
(except the unwilling tofu-taster). I particularly liked the yellowtail roll, 
sliced quite thin, with its delicate little spears of cucumber and crisp 
sunflower sprouts. The tab was reasonable; there's nothing over $3 at the sushi 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
Since the locally caught fish is so fresh, it's also wonderful fried. Sea Fresh 
has a big selection of fish and chips with thin, crisp batter that could -- or 
should -- make English fish and chips lovers weep. (I'm surprised they don't 
put bottles of English vinegar on the tables along with the ketchup. But then 
these aren't English-style chips, either; they're big potatoey wedges rather 
than ordinary fries.) The calamari are an eye-opener, nice and tender. 
</P>
<P>
They also fry their zucchini in great big slices, and really do them justice, 
although they're sprinkled, improbably, with Parmesan cheese. I had the 
zucchini with herbed, baked ahi, which came with an interesting brown sauce, 
very tart, like a buttery reduced sauce. 
</P>
<P>
My biggest disappointment at Sea Fresh is simply that I've never had their 
ceviche; every time I go there, they've run out of it. I have had the creamy 
clam chowder, which is the standard thick variety my husband loves. The steamed 
clams in an oregano-flavored broth had a nice countrified taste. 
</P>
<P>
One of the teen-agers ordered a fish taco. The fish was fried in small pieces 
and served on a thin corn tortilla with lettuce and cheese and salsa. I thought 
it was quite good and at $1.60, it was close to a perfect, light meal all by 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers decided that this was a great place. I think it taught them a 
good marketing lesson too: that if you provide the freshest food and make it 
easy to enjoy, you can be successful. 
</P>

COLLEGE NEWS: CALTECH PROFESSOR WINS CHEMISTRY AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A54-year-old Caltech chemistry professor has won the nation's most prestigious 
award in chemistry, Caltech officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
Harry B. Gray will receive the American Chemical Society's Priestley Medal at 
the organization's national meeting next April in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The award recognizes Gray's research contributions and services to chemistry 
over the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The award was instituted by the American Chemical Society in 1922 to 
commemorate the work of British-born Joseph Priestly, who discovered oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
Gray is one of the nation's leading chemists and is known for his work in 
inorganic chemistry and his research in chemical reactions. He is researching 
the possibility of designing chemical systems that can function as artificial 
counterparts of photosynthesis, the process by which plants gain energy from 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1966, Gray has been a professor of chemistry at Caltech and will serve as 
director of the college's Arnold O. Beckman Institute, which is expected to 
open next week. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, a native of Bowling Green, Ky., received a bachelor of science in 
chemistry from Western Kentucky University in 1957 and a Ph.D. from 
Northwestern University in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
He has served on the National Research Council and the National Academy of 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Gray received the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Chemists 
and the American Chemical Society's Alfred Bader Award. In 1986, he won the 
National Medal of Science and the Pauling Medal.

NEW MAYAN ALPHABET PROVOKES ANGRY LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

GUATEMALA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 1,000 letters and telegrams from people in rural villages, mountains and 
valleys sit on Jose Sanic's desk at the Academy of Mayan Languages in Guatemala 
City. Many warn of serious consequences if a new alphabet for the country's 22 
Mayan languages changes the letters used to represent "w," "q" and "k." Sanic 
smiles wryly and says he is confident that the law will stick and that it is 
the beginning of a resolution to Guatemala's "Indian problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mayans, who prefer the term indigena (native) to Indian, are the majority of 
Guatemala's 8 million people. No more than 600,000 Mayans can read and write in 
any language at any level. In schools where teachers used Spanish, indigenous 
children were thrown into what Eliu Cifuentes, Guatemala's director of 
bilingual education, calls "a violent encounter with literacy, being taught a 
foreign language by a teacher who doesn't speak their tongue." 
</P>
<P>
With President Vinicio Cerezo's election in 1985, the government announced a 
radical change in policy. Spanish will remain the official language, but 
Guatemala will have at least 22 protected languages. As a symbol of its 
commitment to Mayan culture, the government published its new constitution in 
the languages of the four largest Mayan groups -- Mam, Kaqchikel, K'iche' and 
Q'eqchi'. 
</P>
<P>
The bilingual education program, begun as an experiment with funds from the 
United States Agency for International Development, includes 400 schools with 
bilingual classes up to the fourth grade. Cifuentes expects 260,000 students to 
be in the program by 1990. This would represent more than one-third of all 
rural primary school students. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of so many new readers and writers inspired activists to push for 
what they hoped would be a truly Mayan alphabet. Previous efforts to teach 
Mayan were hobbled by a variety of alphabets, most invented by Europeans and 
North Americans. Many used symbols not found on a typewriter or in a print 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the election, Mayans and their friends in Congress created the 
Academy of Mayan Languages within the Ministry of Culture and Sports. The 
academy's first project was to create a unified Mayan alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
During several meetings organized by the academy, most of the debate focused on 
the letters "w," "k" and "q." In the new alphabet, "w" represents sounds 
previously written with "cua," "gu," "qu" and "v." Sounds previously assigned 
to "q" and "k" in most alphabets were reversed, and the European "qu" has 
disappeared. The Aguacateca are now the Awakateka. The Quiche are now the 
K'iche' (the apostrophe indicates a glottal stop). 
</P>
<P>
Many find no fault with the new alphabet's method of equating one letter to one 
sound -- a generally accepted principle among linguists concerned about 
teaching. But debate over the new alphabet is only one part linguistic; it's 
also political and economic. 
</P>
<P>
At the academy, Sanic said, most of the mail on his desk comes from members of 
evangelical Protestant churches, which claim almost 20% of Guatemala's 
population as members. In many communities, evangelicals and their Mayan 
congregations have a large economic and public relations stake in materials 
published using earlier alphabets. 
</P>
<P>
Some consider the rapid adoption of the new alphabet a violation of human 
rights. A K'iche'-speaking senator, Diego Velasco Brito, lodged a formal 
complaint with Guatemala's attorney general for human rights. Abraham Garcia 
responded for the Assn. of Mayan Writers of Guatemala, a 10-year-old indigenous 
group that includes many teachers. He said the association had already begun to 
publish and teach the new alphabet. Its quarterly bulletin also uses the 
alphabet and, "to date, it has had a wonderful reception by readers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While a few proponents of the new alphabet worry about the evangelical 
preachers, they are disturbed by what they feel is professional opposition from 
the best-known organization of linguists, one that has translated most of the 
Christian materials used in evangelical churches as well as religious and 
secular material sold in the Mayan writers association's small bookstore. 
Linguists from the Summer Institute of Linguistics have done by far the largest 
amount of scholarly work on Mayan languages. Most of the dictionaries, school 
texts and books of Mayan stories published in indigenous languages bear the 
institute's imprint. 
</P>
<P>
Mayan activists say it is more important to seize the political opportunities 
than to worry about what they consider nit-picking. Virgilio Ajenal, director 
of the Assn. of Mayan Writers, contended: "The fight is mainly among 
intellectuals. . . . Ninety-nine and nine-tenths of all indigenous people are 
still illiterate, so they will not have to learn anything over." 
</P>
<P>
He said Mayans have listened to outsiders too long. "We don't want outsiders to 
think, to decide and to act for us." As for the value of the material already 
printed, most of it religious, he said: "The people in the countryside cannot 
eat those things." It is time to write practical, how-to-do-it things about 
agriculture and health, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Elliot, director of the Center for Mesoamerican Investigations in 
Antigua, said the need to get on with the new alphabet is exemplified by three 
proposals he received during a week in May. Each asked for help in publishing a 
dictionary of Kaqchikel, each in its own alphabet. "If the energy invested in 
opposing the alphabet were invested in promoting the transition, it would be 
over with," Elliot said. He sums up the debate saying, "It's a matter of what's 
important to us -- the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
Cifuentes said the country is "trying to find a new national identity." The new 
alphabet is an important part of the process. "We are beginning to end the 
colonization of the language that began 400 years ago," he said.

VOTE ON SCHOOL BOND MEASURE AUTHORIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in November will be asked to approve a $75-million general obligation 
bond measure to help repair buildings in the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School 
District, an action the school board authorized this week. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds, which would require approval by two-thirds of the voters, would be 
used to make the schools structurally safe, to bring each campus up to a state 
of good repair and to modernize the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the schools are more than 50 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds would be paid by property tax increases. They would cost the average 
homeowner in the district $5.66 a month over a 25-year period of debt 
repayment, according to report by an advisory committee. The board also 
unanimously authorized the superintendent to begin planning with a bond counsel 
and a financial adviser.

COMPTON WILL BE URGED TO FORECLOSE ON HOTEL PROJECT 
</P>

The developer of the ill-fated Compton Lazben Hotel has failed to meet a 
deadline for paying $6.8 million in construction loans that he owes the city, 
and two council members said they will propose that the city take over the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Compton redevelopment officials billed the $35-million hotel and convention 
center complex along the Artesia Freeway as the catalyst for the city's 
economic revitalization, but from its inception about five years ago, the 
project has been plagued with delays and financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Maxcy D. Filer said he plans to propose that the council begin 
foreclosure proceedings against developer Naftali Deutsch. Councilwoman 
Patricia A. Moore also said she would support such a move, which would have to 
be approved by a majority of the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
"Why shouldn't the city be responsible and take back the hotel and supply 
everything the citizens were promised?" Moore asked. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of their agreement with the city, the developers were to pay 
off the loans by May 31, according to a report that the staff of the city 
Redevelopment Agency sent the council last week. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch said, however, that his agreements with the city were written in such a 
way that it was "understood" that he did not have to pay off the loans until 
the hotel generated a sufficient cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch also said he is "days away" from reaching a franchise agreement with 
the Hilton Hotel Corp. A top city administrator said City Manager Howard 
Caldwell is taking part in the talks with Hilton. Caldwell and Hilton 
representatives did not return calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Filer, however, said he is skeptical about any franchise discussions: "I don't 
want to upset any negotiations, but I just believe this is a ploy." 
</P>
<P>
The developer has earned the enmity of some people in Compton, who say he has 
not lived up to the terms of his development contract. Deutsch halted 
construction several times, saying he needed more money. The city gave him more 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
"Here when people are five days late paying their water bills (to the city), 
they get their water turned off," Moore said, "and this man can go on never 
paying a dime to us." 
</P>
<P>
Filer said: "He has been in default as a contractor for over two years. He has 
been in default of the loan (payments) over 10 months. He is now in default on 
the loan." 
</P>
<P>
According to Filer and Moore, the developers owe the city more than $400,000 in 
interest payments, in addition to the $6.8 million in principal that was due 
last week. The city and the developers have been arguing for two years about 
whether the project was built to the city's specifications. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, saying some of the furnishings and construction materials did 
not meet specifications, withheld some payments from the construction firm, 
Tucon Development, until it replaced some of the items. 
</P>
<P>
The Deutsch family owns Tucon and other construction companies that worked on 
the hotel. Deutsch's son, Benjamin, said his father now has no financial 
interest in any of the construction companies or any of the financial or 
management companies involved in the hotel development. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Deutsch said he and his three brothers own and control all the various 
firms.

A CANADIAN PHYSICIST FINDS UNDERSTANDING OF THE AGES AS A STUDENT AT THOMAS 
AQUINAS COLLEGE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, Edward De Vita was living in Vancouver, B.C., earning more than 
$30,000 a year as an engineering physicist. Age 32 and single, he lived in an 
apartment, drove a Mazda and had good friends. Not a bad deal for most people. 
But one day, he noticed some books on a friend's bookshelf, and it changed his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, De Vita received his bachelor of arts degree in liberal arts from 
Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula. He has spent the last four years and 
$55,000 of his savings living in a dorm with a curfew, a dress code and men 10 
years his junior, enrolled in a unique curriculum based solely upon selected 
classics of Western civilization dating from 2500 B.C. to the early part of 
this century. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here to study the 'Great Books,' the theology and philosophy," said De 
Vita, his accent betraying his Canadian origin. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the kind of education people used to get," he said. The opportunity 
of a lifetime -- to be generally, liberally educated. 
</P>
<P>
De Vita already had a B.A. in applied engineering physics. Before deciding that 
once was not enough, he had worked for nine years at a company called TRIUMF, 
where he designed giant magnets for the cyclotron used in hospital treatment 
that creates radioactive isotopes. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, I wasn't as interested in literature, but I became more 
desirous of broadening my education as I got older," said De Vita. "What we 
read in philosophy could be applied in math, science lab and even literature 
classes." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Aquinas College only offers one degree, a B.A. in liberal arts. It is 
one of a handful of colleges nationwide that offers a four-year curriculum 
using the "Great Books" as its formidable reading list. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of previous education, students must enroll as freshmen. There are 
no elective courses, and the responsibility for learning is on the students, 
who participate in tutorials and small seminars after reading works by such 
writers as Machiavelli, Descartes, Einstein and Aristotle. A professor presides 
at these sessions, but learning is based upon the Socratic method of question 
and answer, not lecture. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dean Thomas E. Dillon, students read the "Great Books" in order to 
understand for themselves the principles and methods of various disciplines, 
rather than being told by experts what they mean. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mathematics tutorials, we read Euclid and Apollonius on conic sections 
so that we are well prepared to read the texts of Galileo and Newton 
themselves," Dillon said. "Then we read Descartes' application of algebra to 
geometry." 
</P>
<P>
Students also study Latin for the first two years and read some classics in the 
original language. 
</P>
<P>
Each student is assigned a writing tutor his first year and must produce a 
senior thesis. De Vita's 58-page work, "On the Nature of Time," compared the 
Aristotelian and relativistic views of time. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1971, Thomas Aquinas College is a private, coeducational 
independent Catholic school not affiliated with any religious order or diocese. 
Although about 90% of the students are Catholic, participation in religious 
activities is not required. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment is 176, there are 18 faculty members, and classes have 14 to 18 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rigorous curriculum, about 70% of the students complete the 
four-year program compared to 20% in traditional colleges. While Dillon 
observed that "students don't come here to get a job after four years," he 
added that a higher percentage of their alumni go on to graduate and 
professional schools than from traditional college programs. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled on 163 rolling acres adjoining Los Padres National Forest, the college 
has few distractions aside from the sounds of nature. Thomas Aquinas is a 
residential campus with a goal of fostering a 24-hour educational process. With 
rare exceptions, such as married students, everyone lives in the dorms all four 
years. To show respect for their pursuits, students do not wear jeans or 
sneakers outside of sporting events. Women wear dresses or skirts, and men 
avoid collarless T-shirts. In class, students are addressed as Mr. or Miss. 
Possession of alcohol or drugs is strictly forbidden, along with any dorm 
visitation by members of the opposite gender. 
</P>
<P>
Students are encouraged to help each other with their education. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed's mature, got a wealth of wisdom and is very affable and quick-witted. 
People come to him for almost everything," said David Houseal, De Vita's 
26-year-old roommate. 
</P>
<P>
"When papers are due, I'll come in at night and find three or four guys on the 
bed asking questions," said Houseal. "Because he's had more life experience and 
is a bright man, Ed can make sense out of a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Besides study groups, men and women students socialize at school dances, 
intramural coeducational sports and recreational activities such as horseback 
riding and hiking. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the age difference, De Vita has made friends and become involved in 
many aspects of campus life. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I dance? Not very well, but I give it the old college try," he said. "But 
the lambada is out." 
</P>
<P>
De Vita plays classical guitar and enjoys hockey, tennis and chess. He was the 
college's volunteer choir director and helped select videos for campus 
screenings. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed has a good sense of humor and a dry wit. He's good at impersonations and 
voices." said Carl Schmitt, 22. 
</P>
<P>
"He does a great Bogart," said John Goyette, 20. "Ed loves old, classic films." 
</P>
<P>
Both classmates were very impressed that De Vita returned to school because he 
felt he had missed out on a liberal arts education. 
</P>
<P>
De Vita is not the only older student at the college. About 10 students ages 26 
to 31 are currently enrolled, and this fall, two 26-year-old freshmen with 
business degrees will join them. 
</P>
<P>
De Vita said that coming from a more mature perspective required an adjustment. 
"For the first month, I thought I had made a mistake. For instance, in the 
classroom, the younger students were more rambunctious." 
</P>
<P>
But he is glad he stayed. The product of a strong Italian Catholic background, 
De Vita now is considering entering the priesthood after returning home this 
summer. He would eventually like to teach in a program similar to that of his 
new alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
One thing's for sure. Those books made an impression on De Vita. 
</P>

HEARING SET ON BKK LANDFILL SAFETY PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
State health officials will hold a public meeting Wednesday to detail 
environmental safety measures that have been taken at the BKK Corp. landfill, 
once Southern California's primary toxic waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
The dump stopped accepting toxic waste in 1984, and officially closed its toxic 
section last year. 
</P>
<P>
West of the closed section, BKK still operates a 443-acre dump, accepting 
non-hazardous trash. It is the second-largest facility of its kind in Los 
Angeles County and is one of the nation's largest. 
</P>
<P>
BKK expects to continue operating this part of the landfill until 1995, said 
Jake Amar, the firm's environmental systems manager. 
</P>
<P>
State officials require closed dumps to submit plans for future maintenance of 
their sites. After the plans are approved, the state issues a "post-closure 
permit" to the facility. The 6:30 p.m. meeting at the West Covina Senior 
Center, 2501 E. Cortez St., will focus on the permit process. 
</P>
<P>
At the three-hour meeting, state health department officials will give a 
presentation and then allow time for questions from the public. 
</P>
<P>
During the last six years, BKK has spent nearly $38 million in improvements and 
equipment related to closing the toxic area, Amar said. The firm covered the 
area with clay ranging in depth from six to 20 feet, he said. There is also an 
intricate system that collects gas generated by the decomposing wastes and uses 
it to run electricity-generating turbines. The energy is sold to Southern 
California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, state health officials said, they expect to hold a formal 
public hearing on the post-closure permit.

In a tiny apartment in a run-down Philadelphia neighborhood, Daisy Thomas lived 
alone. Pictures crowded the walls of her living room, a memorial to a past 
life. A copy of the Lord's Prayer hung above the door. Artificial flowers, 
faded with age, decorated the coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred miles from Daisy's place, down the coast in Columbia, S.C., 
69-year-old Mattie Collins lived in a tired old house on the edge of town. She 
moved there after being evicted from her apartment 3 months before. Health 
problems, a son-in-law who stole from her and a string of bad luck drove her 
into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy and Mattie represent just two of the 8.3 million older Americans who live 
alone. More than 40% live at or near the poverty line. Most of the elderly poor 
receive only enough help from social workers and volunteers to survive -- 
occasional visits from social workers or home health aides, a meal a day from 
Meals on Wheels or a few dollars' worth of food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly women make up 80% of those who live alone. While Social Security and 
Medicare have helped to halve the poverty rate among senior citizens over the 
past 25 years, millions remain destitute. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy Thomas and Mattie Collins recently gave a visitor a glimpse into this 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy's hands shook and her voice wavered as she spoke about growing old and 
living alone in a city that she once loved. Her neighborhood, where children 
once played in the streets, is now home to drugs, poverty and violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'm afraid of being robbed. I got my Social Security check stolen right 
out from under me one day," she said, her eyes filled with fear, as if the 
incident had just happened. "I had just cashed my check and that boy grabbed 
most of it and I never saw him again. Getting old is not for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
After the robbery -- which took place nearly a year ago -- she kept the 
dead-bolts on her front door locked tight. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get robbed, that's it. Nobody is there to return it to you. You just 
have to get by on what's left." 
</P>
<P>
To her visitor, it seemed hot in her cramped living room, but to Daisy, it 
still felt cold. Her eyes wandered nervously around the room, reflecting the 
discomfort she felt having someone there. She didn't want people to know how 
poor she really was. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to ask people for money, but if you get hungry enough, you'll ask," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after that conversation, Daisy died, alone in her final moments just 
as she had been in the final years of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy, who suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic heart 
failure, survived on a Social Security check and some food stamps. Not much was 
left after she paid her rent and utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
And she received little outside help. Underfinanced and short-staffed, the 
nearby office on aging could only afford to send someone by once every 8 weeks 
to tell her she was still on the waiting list for a home-care program. 
</P>
<P>
In a deteriorating neighborhood in Columbia, Mattie slowly ate the meal 
delivered once a day by the local office on aging, pretending not to notice the 
cockroaches crawling on her TV tray and couch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound like a preacher," she said quietly, "but people 
shouldn't be treated like this. You work hard all your life and then you get to 
the point where you can't do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
From a wheelchair in her cold, empty living room, she told of being evicted by 
her last landlord without even a chance to move her belongings. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw away all of my things," she said. "My baby pictures, clothes, 
washing machine. Everything went out on the trash pile. What wasn't stolen got 
ruined in the rain." 
</P>
<P>
Worse, the grandson that she loved and cared for was recently taken away by the 
social services department. Just barely able to take care of herself, she could 
not take care of the child. Noting that her daughter was too poor to care for 
him herself, Mattie said, "That boy has been my life." 
</P>
<P>
Mattie has been hit hard with health problems in recent years. Two strokes, 
four heart attacks, arthritis, kidney disease and respiratory problems have 
left her nearly helpless. Dentures are not covered by Medicare, so she does 
without. 
</P>
<P>
Her sole support comes from a monthly Social Security check and food stamps. 
With that, she manages to give some money to her daughter, who lives nearby. A 
social worker stops by occasionally to update her file. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how she gets by, Mattie smiled and said, "It takes a lot of strength."

PETER AND LUISA HYUN FIND THE PEACEFUL SEASIDE SUPPORTS THE BOOKS THEY'RE BOTH 
WRITING.

<P>
Whom do you expect to be living in a mobile home in Oxnard? A Midwestern family 
eager for sunshine? A young bride and groom starting out? Certainly not a 
couple of super sophisticates like Peter and Luisa Hyun. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hyun, 83, is a theatrical director, educator and author. In spite of 
recent cancer surgery, he plays tennis every day and works on the sequel to his 
book, "Man Sei: The Making of a Korean American." 
</P>
<P>
Luisa, 75, one of the beautiful Powers Models of the '30s, was known as the 
Woodbury Soap Filtered Sunshine Girl. In the Woodbury ad, seen all over 
America, the great photographer Edward Steichen had snapped her in a 
provocative nude pose, barely shielded by the iron arm of a sundial. She is now 
writing a book about how three of her many marriages took her into the world of 
theater and cinema. She calls it "Carole Lombard Gave Me a Jersey Cow for a 
Wedding Present -- and Other Stories." 
</P>
<P>
"Gary Cooper was the best man at my wedding to Jack Moss," said Luisa, who was 
born Louise Stewart. "There was something exciting about all my marriages. Moss 
was the producer of Orson Welles' films, so of course I got to know Orson 
well." She smiled at her own pun. "Then I married Joseph Losey, the American 
director Americans hardly know." He left here in 1951 and made movies in 
England. He's the darling of the French and English. . . . Through him I met 
Charles Laughton. Hans Eisler, Berthold Brecht. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hyun interrupted to ask his wife if she'd like to taste the cracked crab. 
"Where," he said, "except in Oxnard on Fisherman's Wharf could we be sitting in 
the sun, eating seafood, watching the boats go by -- and talking about Brecht?" 
</P>
<P>
Brecht got Luisa started on a recitation on Peter's career. "After majoring in 
drama at DePaul University in Indiana, he became stage manager of Eva 
LeGallienne's New York Civic Repertory Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my best years," Peter Hyun said, "were when I directed children's 
plays and ran puppet shows for the Federal Theatre in New York. But there was 
just too much racial discrimination in the theater of the '40s. I couldn't work 
-- and then came World War II. I was Army Intelligence. I could speak Korean, 
Japanese, Chinese and Tagalog." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hyun's father, a Methodist minister, the Rev. Soon Hyun, was a hero of 
the Korean independence movement "Man Sei." The phrase means 10,000 years, and 
has long been a rallying cry against invaders. 
</P>
<P>
"What finally started me writing it," says Hyun, "was that in 1975 the Korean 
government asked that my father's ashes be transported to Seoul for a hero's 
burial." 
</P>
<P>
The journey to Korea to see his father honored as a patriot was the first Hyun 
had taken to his native country since 1919. 
</P>
<P>
Peter and Luisa Hyun have now been married 25 years. This is her fifth marriage 
and though Luisa is more than happy to discuss three of her husbands, she does 
not talk about the other two. 
</P>
<P>
The Hyuns lived and taught in Mexico until 10 years ago when they moved to 
Oxnard to be near her son, Michael Farnum, and his family, and to be nearer to 
Peter Hyun's family in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"When we moved back to the States," Luisa Hyun said, "we both taught English as 
a second language at Oxnard Union High School. Then we decided it was time to 
devote ourselves to our writing. This is a great place to do that. Between the 
sea and the farming, it's very peaceful."

MOO-VING PARTY KENNY O'NEILL ISN'T COWED BY HIS RUN-IN WITH A HEIFER. HIS 
ANNUAL BIRTHDAY BASH IS SATURDAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura's Kenny O'Neill (alias Kenny Borrell, after the jazz guitarist with the 
homophonic last name) is advertising his fourth-annual birthday bash, June 16, 
as "More fun than the wild West had . . . hop off your horse and dance 'til the 
cows come home." 
</P>
<P>
Well, exactly one week ago, one of those heifers almost put an end to any 
celebration. Just 10 days before the event, O'Neill was driving over the Conejo 
grade at 70 m.p.h. when he hit a cow (presumably coming home). He needed 12 
stitches on his arm, he had cuts on his legs, and he had a bump on his head. 
But by the next day he was "ready to paaaaarteeeee." 
</P>
<P>
For those not familiar with O'Neill's parties, they are like a child's dream 
come true. He invites everyone he knows. Everyone. But O'Neill is only a child 
in spirit. He'll be 33 this time around. 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't pounding cars at The Fender Mender in Ventura, O'Neill is a 
bouncer at Eric Ericssons, the site of the party. "When I turned 30, I decided, 
let's have a party," he said. "The first year I spent over $1,000. We had a 
band. We had T-shirts." And of course gifts. 
</P>
<P>
This year, a new car would probably be more appropriate. O'Neill totaled his in 
the cow collision. 
</P>
<P>
According to The Fouled Anchor, the newsletter of the Channel Islands Yacht 
Club, Mr. and Mrs. Sturgeon have applied for membership. That's George and 
Sarah Sturgeon of Glendale. Commodore Robert Hamilton wasn't aware of any 
change in the rules making it a requirement that members have water-related 
surnames. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai watercolorist Carol Berlin has a busy exhibit schedule. 
</P>
<P>
In March, she had a show at the Turgut Pura Vakfi Gallery in Izmir, Turkey; 
now, three months later, she's showing her work at the Doubletree Hotel in 
Ventura through July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, she loves to travel. For the past 14 years Berlin, her husband, 
Cliff, and a friend from high school have been sailing all over the world on 
their sailboat, "Sunshine." They've been to Italy, France, Greece, Australia, 
Indonesia and Singapore, just to name a few spots. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had lots and lots of close calls. We've had a lot of times wondering why 
we were" on the boat, said Berlin. "The seas are bigger than us. The freighters 
are 100 times bigger than us. We've always called ourselves the chickens of the 
sea. If someone is going to give way, it will be us." 
</P>
<P>
The trio will next set sail at the end of the year, headed for Istanbul, where 
Berlin will open an exhibit in February. LEO SMITH

CAMBRIDGE SCHOOLS TEACH STUDENTS MEDIATION SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE MUNDELL, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a long way from clapping the erasers after school as a punishment for bad 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Mediation and negotiation have become watchwords for many U.S. educators. With 
school violence on the rise, teachers are turning to these innovative ways to 
maintain classroom harmony. 
</P>
<P>
The Cambridge school system has been teaching a pilot class in mediation to a 
portion of its freshmen for several years. The class may soon become a 
requirement throughout the school. Its instructor, John Silva, director of 
safety and security in the Cambridge school system, also runs a mediation 
program that uses both teachers and students as mediators. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 3 years, Silva's "Just Agreement Through Mediation" program has 
trained 20 students and 15 teachers to act as mediators in classroom and 
schoolyard clashes at the city's 2,600-student Cambridge Rindge and Latin 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The mediation program helps by "pulling students out of the hallways, where the 
peer pressure is . . . and giving them an opportunity to sit down and think 
maturely," Silva says. 
</P>
<P>
Only two out of 180 cases mediated were not resolved to the satisfaction of all 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
All the cases involved students. The other parties have been other students, 
teachers, administrators, and even parents. Given the school's inner-city 
setting and the 70 nationalities in the student body, Silva says, the program's 
success is remarkable. He credits it to the students' perception that the 
process is fair. Participation is voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
Tough kids, especially, don't respond well to disciplinary actions, the veteran 
administrator says. Ultimatums are seen as a threat and an opportunity to 
rebel. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Gaynor, one of the program's two coordinators, explains that the 
mediation efforts began "in a reaction mode" but have become preventive in 
scope. "We need to unload the extra baggage we bring to school sometimes . . . 
and get back to the business of learning and education," Gaynor says. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension rate at the Cambridge school has decreased since the mediation 
project began. Although several factors may be involved, Silva and his 
mediators can claim at least partial credit for the reduction in problems. For 
one thing, the mediation program works at resolving conflict before it breaks 
out in violence or disruptions that end in suspension. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 teachers and administrators from across the country who wanted to 
learn how to use and teach conflict-resolution skills attended a workshop last 
summer sponsored by Boston-area Educators for Social Responsibility (ESR). 
</P>
<P>
The workshop, run by former teachers William Kreidler and Stephen Weimar, shows 
participants how to enlist students -- from kindergarten to 12th grade -- as 
peacemakers in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Kreidler began teaching in the Boston public schools in 1974, "a banner year 
for conflict." That was the year that Boston schools were desegregated, and 
racial tension was at its height. He says, "I had to deal with conflict in 
order to get to the reading and the writing and the math." 
</P>
<P>
What began as survival skills for himself grew when he realized how eager his 
second-graders were to learn peacemaking skills -- and how easily they applied 
them. Kreidler says peacemaking skills "give kids a framework to look at their 
community and even international conflicts" in an objective way. 
</P>
<P>
The techniques aim to reduce the number of arguments and fights in school by 
encouraging children to see things from the other kid's point of view, then to 
resolve the disputes that do break out through negotiation or mediation. 
</P>
<P>
Kreidler uses simple activities that can be taken back to the classroom. At one 
workshop two teachers role-played a dispute between a mother and her 
11-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
To hoots and howls from the rest of the group, "Tom" scowled and avoided eye 
contact with his mother, while "Mom" defended her position to the hilt with a 
mother-knows-best attitude. Eventually a compromise was reached, giving "Tom" a 
raise in his allowance if he gave "Mom" some additional help and did all his 
chores regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"The field of conflict resolution cuts across the political spectrum," 
attracting teachers of all ages and teaching styles, Kreidler says. In the past 
year, the Boston ESR chapter, staffed primarily by full-time teachers, has 
given about 50 teacher workshops in conflict-resolution theory. The feedback 
has been excellent, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Eva Braz, a sophomore at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, took the school's 
mediation class last year. Then she and her classmates were invited to become 
school mediators. Half a dozen did. She has since mediated four disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Eva says that when students are given a choice between suspension and 
mediation, "all of them want to go to mediation; no one wants to get 
suspended." 
</P>
<P>
But disputants also know, she says, that "if we don't get an agreement or if 
they don't want to talk, we send them back to the house masters," where they 
are encouraged to try again to reach a mediated agreement. If they do not, they 
face suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Eva says role-playing in mediation class was helpful. She learned to explain 
the rules of mediation, ask questions, and find out what the individuals 
involved want to get out of the mediation session: "Do you want to be friends, 
or just say 'hi' in the hallway, or not speak to one another?" she asks 
participants at the beginning of each session. 
</P>
<P>
Her involvement in the mediation program has paid off in other ways, too. 
"Sometimes when I have problems myself, I think about it. It helps me out, 
too."

foreclosed properties owned by the government. Congress considers these and 
other proposals of its own. HOWARD BLUME

EATING VEGETABLES CUTS CHOLESTEROL AND CAN HELP SAVE THE FORESTS AND PROTECT 
THE OZONE LAYER.

It's another growing season, and farmers are hoping President Bush will come 
out against another vegetable. "It did wonders for broccoli," a Southern 
California farmer told me last week. "Right now, we're a little long on giant 
asparagus." 
</P>
<P>
You might well ask how a dazzling urbanite like yourself (or myself) could 
possibly be interested in agricultural market conditions. Recently, I visited 
the doctor who was incredulous at my cholesterol count. I was alarmed until I 
realized her surprise was over how low the numbers were, not how high. She 
asked me what I regularly ate, and after hearing my recitation, she said in a 
voice tinged with alarm, "Why, you're practically a vegetarian!" 
</P>
<P>
I could go on about the health benefits of eating veggies and fruits, but this 
is an environmental column, not a health column. So let's talk about the 
earth's health, not mine. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentally, your veggies play a fascinating role in the world. If you eat 
more of them, you're helping not just your own health but the planet's. I have 
read that every person who switches to a pure vegetarian diet saves an acre of 
trees from being cut every year. 
</P>
<P>
Last week brought alarming news about forest loss. It's far worse -- half again 
as bad as we thought. Fifty million acres going each year. A whole state's 
worth. Big states like Washington. Meat production is one of the big causes. 
The harm is threefold. Loss of the oxygen-producing trees, plus the carbon 
pollution from the burning. Plus -- and this is both alarming and disagreeable 
-- the cattle that replace the trees on the land produce digestive gases that 
account for fully a third of the greenhouse effect (according to both the old 
and new deforestation reports from the U.N.). 
</P>
<P>
This is not an anti-Burger King tirade, by the way. The minute they offered 
chicken earlier this year their sales of that sandwich quickly accounted for a 
third of their business. And McDonald's is now posting notices letting you know 
how to avoid fat. We have choices, and the fast food people are going along by 
changing their offerings. 
</P>
<P>
If there is an "enemy" or something "bad," it's inertia or old attitudes. And 
that's changing. It's already gone so far that people are saying, "OK, so I'm 
eating more veggies -- for my cholesterol -- and, if you say so -- for the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
"But what about the pesticides? When I go vegetarian, do I have to go organic, 
too?" I discussed this with a Moorpark grower who, you would think, had every 
reason to turn up his nose at supermarket veggies. I mean his thing is to have 
you come on his organic farm and pick your own right out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
He showed me reports of a the State Department of Food and Agriculture study 
saying that 90% of the fruits and vegetables in the supermarkets are 
pesticide-free. From 5% to 8% have marginal residue and 2% to 3% enough to be 
concerned about. But you'd have to stick to eating only that particular 
vegetable from that farm every day for the rest of your life to get sick. 
</P>
<P>
Tap water with chlorine is more dangerous, according to Berkeley professor 
Bruce Ames, whose research is the basis of the California anti-toxics ballot 
initiative. He says the real way to beat cancer is not to worry about 
pesticides on your vegetables but to eat less fat. 
</P>
<P>
Further, his review of the biochemical reactions of thousands of chemicals we 
usually ingest suggests that certain of them, directly or in foods, might 
reduce the onset of cancer. Ames includes Vitamin E, beta-carotene from carrots 
and green or yellow veggies, Vitamin C and phenols from cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
So, let's hope the President has additional vegetables on his mind. He can do 
us and our local growers a service by bringing us together often.

CHADWICK HIGH FIRST BASEMAN MIKE HARRIS IS A REAL OUTSIDER; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: HE HAS THE BUILD OF A BASKETBALL PLAYER, BUT INDOOR SPORTS ARE 
NOT HIS GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At 6-foot-5 and 210 pounds, Mike Harris of Chadwick School has the bulk of a 
power forward. 
</P>
<P>
But Harris, who played first base at Chadwick, will attend Northwestern 
University in Evanston, Ill., next year on a partial baseball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Harris loves baseball for sentimental reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"You're outside on the grass, and the sun is shining," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He dislikes basketball, because of similar sentiments. "You're cooped up 
inside, on wooden floors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Much to the disappointment of Chadwick basketball Coach Tom Maier, who tried to 
persuade Harris to come out for basketball when Harris was a gangly sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Every time Maier asked, Harris simply said sorry. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach tried so hard to get me to play," Harris said. "I think he's still 
mad at me." 
</P>
<P>
But even if Harris was part of the basketball coach's frustration, he turned 
into the baseball coach's dream. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is just totally in love with baseball," Chadwick Coach Jim Drennen said. 
"He'd play baseball every minute of the day if you'd let him. He'd play every 
day, 12 months a year." 
</P>
<P>
A three-year starter, Harris beefed up in the weight room over the summer and 
hit .400 this season, with five home runs. He drove in 22 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Harris specialized in math and science at Chadwick, a challenging academic prep 
school. His grades were good enough that he was accepted to engineering 
programs at Northwestern, USC, Dartmouth, California, Notre Dame and Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
Since Chadwick is off the beaten path for most baseball scouts, Harris did a 
bit of self-promotion. He sent letters to college coaches around the country, 
made phone calls and weighed the responses. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern baseball Coach Paul Stevens showed the most interest. Stevens 
studied scouting reports filed on Harris by the Major League Scouting Bureau, 
then met the recruit when he flew to Chicago in February for a campus visit. 
</P>
<P>
It was the reports of Harris' tape-measure power that swayed Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
In a Prep League game against Webb in Claremont -- where the fences are deep -- 
Harris launched a line drive that sailed over the 379-foot mark on the 
left-field fence, then cleared a stand of spruce and oak trees behind the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"The umpire told me he hadn't seen a ball hit quite that hard in the four years 
he'd been working," Drennen said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris hit another long-distance homer in a game against visiting Miraleste -- 
a two-out, two-run shot that erased a 2-0 Miraleste lead in the bottom of the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
During batting practice, Harris regularly put on home run derby clinics, 
clearing Chadwick's fences up to 10 times a session. He has a quick, compact 
swing for a big man, and his strong arms generate long line drives. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get it in his zone, he's going to tag it," Drennen said. 
</P>
<P>
When he first arrived at Chadwick, Harris was a bit awkward in the field. He 
was a "big kid who hadn't caught up with his body yet," Drennen said. 
</P>
<P>
But after filling out, Harris turned into a smooth fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was the only senior in Chadwick's inexperienced infield. Second baseman 
Darren Dragg was a junior, and shortstop Chris Gordon and third baseman Mac 
McKinnie were both sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
Harris helped them by directing bunt coverages and pick-off plays. He was also 
adept at scooping out wild throws -- which he did twice to end innings in 
Chadwick's victory over Rio Hondo Prep. The Dolphins needed to win to reach the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"For a big guy, he's got real soft hands," Drennen said. "Poorly thrown balls 
don't clang off his glove. He can catch anything he can get to, and at 6-5, he 
can get to a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, from Manhattan Beach, will become the fourth Chadwick alum to play 
college baseball at the Division I level next year. He'll join University of 
San Diego pitcher Adam Schwindt, Fordham pitcher Greg O'Riordan and Bucknell 
infielder Jeff Karnes. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern isn't a traditional baseball stronghold, but Harris will get a 
chance to prove himself and play against Big 10 powerhouses such as Michigan 
and Illinois. He'll be the seventh player from California on Northwestern's 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Stevens said I was a raw talent," Harris said. "He said I could play 
first or third, or pitch, just do whatever they need me to do." 
</P>
<P>
Drennen said he thinks Harris could develop into a fine college pitcher. 
Harris' pitching time in high school was limited, so he needs work on his 
mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
"If Northwestern is patient, he could help them out on the mound," Drennen 
said. "He can throw really hard." 
</P>
<P>
But the right-handed hitting Harris is tailor-made for Northwestern's ballpark, 
where the fences are within easy reach and the ball carries well to left field. 
</P>
<P>
Also, snow on the field until early spring is not unusual, a fact that Drennen 
pointed out to Harris before his recruiting visit. Drennen wanted Harris to see 
Northwestern in February, when the weather would be at its worst and the wind 
would be howling off Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Harris didn't see much grass or sun, but that wasn't a problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us around here complain if it's 60 degrees and overcast," Drennen 
said. "Not Mike. He'd go to school in Fairbanks if it meant he could play 
baseball."

DECKHAND LEAVES THE BOAT BEHIND WHEN HE TURNS ANGLER

<P>
What does a sportfishing boat deckhand do on his day off? He goes fishing, of 
course, but not from a boat. 
</P>
<P>
When Scott Hart of Torrance heads out to fish, he takes a water ski jacket, 
fins, a freshwater rod and reel, some jigs and a few feathers attached to his 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Hart got some unexpected action after he entered the surf at Cabrillo 
Beach. Using 10-pound test line with a two-ounce sinker and a feather, he 
hooked a small herring and started to paddle back to shore. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 yards out, he had a heavy strike. He set his hook and most all the 
line peeled from the small reel. 
</P>
<P>
With a fish in tow, Hart headed for the beach, hand-lining his catch, which 
turned out to be a halibut just under the legal 22-inch limit. He released it 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Hart tries to get out into the water early in the morning, but heavy swells, 
jet skiers and windsurfers can be hazards to a ski jacket fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
Hart has tried tube float fishing before, but prefers the ski jacket method. 
The biggest drawback, he said, is there is only the jacket to hold his bait and 
gear. 
</P>
<P>
King Harbor Marlin Club members have been scoring some good catches that count 
toward individual points for yearly awards. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stephens and Jack Terry caught a 10-pound bonito off Catalina Island. The 
two Torrance fishermen also caught barracuda and calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
Club member Carl Hanni, fishing from the Striker, reeled in an eight-pound 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
Member Ray Hawkins, who spent last week surf fishing at Jal Ama Beach in 
Central California, landed a starry flounder in five feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
Starry flounders are natives of Alaska and the Sea of Japan. Their average 
length is three feet and they can weigh up to 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Third Annual Catalina Mako Shark Tournament is open to all private boats. 
Cash prizes will be determined by the number of entries. The tournament begins 
tomorrow and ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Greg Redding of West Los Angeles, fishing off Catalina 
Island aboard the Top Gun, hooked a yellowtail that ran into bull kelp. After a 
25-minute battle, Redding came away with the whopper of the week, a 44-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Coates of Long Beach, fishing at Rocky Point aboard the Southern Cal, won 
the jackpot with a 41-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hile of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Outerlimits off Catalina Island, 
caught a 31-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Tawi of Torrance caught a 30-pound white sea bass aboard the Aztec. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Eskita of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Victory, caught a 26-pound 
yellowtail at Rocky Point. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Garcia of Long Beach caught an 18-pound yellowtail, and Betty Cohen of 
Harbor City reeled in a 16-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Barracuda and sand bass dominate the local fishing. White sea 
bass and yellowtail action off Catalina Island rated excellent. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Del Mar returned with 110 calico bass, 54 
sand bass, six bonito and a halibut on a half-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
The Spitfire fished the bay and caught 230 sand bass and 22 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers on the Betty O sacked 175 rock cod and a lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Sumo fished in the Venice area and returned with 120 rock fish and a 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray on a sand bass trip to Rocky Point 
returned with 170 fish. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Sportking fished Catalina Island with success, 
returning with 170 barracuda and a yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Top Gun fished Catalina Island and anglers came away with 32 yellowtail, 21 
white sea bass, and 20 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits worked Catalina for 156 calico bass, 33 yellowtail, and 20 
white sea bass and a black sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun Catalina Trip netted 145 barracuda, eight white sea bass, and four 
yellowtail.

took 165 barracuda, nine yellowtail and seven halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Monte Carlo fished the rigs on a half-day trip and returned with 57 
barracuda, 41 sand bass and 23 calico bass.

barracuda, 53 calico bass and a white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Cal on a half-day trip to Horseshoe Kelp returned with 133 
barracuda, 82 sand bass and a white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec trip to Catalina Island resulted in a catch of 120 barracuda, 56 
calico bass and two yellowtail.

<P>
Auntie Chris' Pampered Pets is packed away in a tiny white building trimmed in 
pale blue, just off Fillmore's main street. Adjoining the shop is a thin slice 
of lawn where Miss Piggy, a blind cocker spaniel with fur the color of 
cardboard, romps and occasionally bumps into the fence. Inside, dog training 
manuals are propped up by dusty bookends shaped like Snoopy. The place smells 
like wet dog. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Ellsworth, the shop's owner, is the only dog groomer in town -- the 
person Fillmore folks visit when they want their dogs bathed, brushed or 
trained. 
</P>
<P>
Dog training is a side business for Ellsworth, but it's one that lends the most 
adventure to her enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their first group class," said Ellsworth, getting out of her car at a 
nearby cul-de-sac, where five dogs await her instruction. "Don't expect much. 
The first class is always, well, insane, hysterical, unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
The dogs had recently completed what Ellsworth, 38, called "puppy 
kindergarten," the basics, which help curb barking, chewing, jumping and weak 
bladders. 
</P>
<P>
At the sight of Ellsworth, five dogs dragged four owners down driveways to an 
neat asphalt circle that formed the cul-de-sac. "This is going to be a long 10 
weeks," Ellsworth said under her breath. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs are fence-mates and belong to four families who moved to the 
cul-de-sac in 1988. Coincidently, the owners all began purchasing dogs about 
five months ago to round out their growing families. There seemed to be enough 
material in the scenario for a television sitcom. "Married . . . With Dogs" is 
how one neighbor put it. 
</P>
<P>
Ellsworth trains dogs using guidelines set by the American Kennel Club, a 
nationwide registry for purebred dogs and dog shows. Her shop also serves as 
Fillmore's makeshift canine adoption agency. "People are always dumping litters 
of six or eight over the fence," said Ellsworth, who charges $50 for 10 
one-hour classes. 
</P>
<P>
After a chat about "taking dominance over your dog or else your dog will take 
dominance over you," Ellsworth demonstrated the first lesson. Rosie, 
Ellsworth's keeshound, was the model pupil. 
</P>
<P>
After executing commands of stand, sit and stay, Rosie smartly trotted around 
the circle at the command of heel. The students, Annie, Shelby, Ben, Jem and 
Pepsi, yawned and scratched their ears. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, we're going to try the heel command," said Ellsworth, snapping Rosie's 
leash on her palm. "Just dive into it. Ready? And forward!" Annie, a Dalmatian, 
hit the asphalt and went belly-up. Jem, a plump St. Bernard the size of a fire 
hydrant, and Pepsi, a chunky Labrador retriever, wouldn't budge and laid down 
when Ellsworth said, "And halt!" 
</P>
<P>
Rosie surveyed the group from her center position in the circle. 
</P>
<P>
"This is work," Ellsworth said. "This is the first day." 
</P>
<P>
The dogs, Ellsworth said, were just being dogs. It was up to the owners to give 
their charges stronger commands. 
</P>
<P>
"Put some real drama in your voice," Ellsworth said. "When you say no, sit or 
heel, say it like you mean it." 
</P>
<P>
The group tried the commands again. Although the soft-spoken owners were 
clearly the source of all confusion, Ellsworth made Pepsi, the chubby, 
4-month-old Labrador, an example for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Ellsworth walked the circle with Pepsi in tow, yanking the choke chain when the 
perplexed dog lagged behind or wandered off. "HEEL PEPSI, HEEL!" Ellsworth 
commanded, patting her leg. Pepsi yelped repeatedly as she was yanked in. Other 
owners followed Ellsworth's example, and their dogs quickly learned the 
command. Pepsi was still having difficulty. "C'mon, everybody else is doing 
it," Ellsworth pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
"Would a treat help?" asked Kathy LeBard, Pepsi's owner, who was splitting her 
attention between training Pepsi and looking after Michael, her 7-year-old son, 
who romped the neighborhood with friends. 
</P>
<P>
"She hasn't done anything right yet to deserve a treat," Ellsworth said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
Ellsworth squatted to eye Pepsi. "No, no one's going to help you." Pepsi still 
wasn't getting it. After a few more minutes of leash yanking, Pepsi -- with a 
kind of blind obedience common to rabbits held frozen by glaring car headlights 
-- began to heel. 
</P>
<P>
" Good girrrrl!" Ellsworth purred. "Good girrrrl!" 
</P>
<P>
As the lesson ended, Ellsworth encouraged the owners to spend 20 minutes a day 
reinforcing the lesson. "But with Pepsi, go slowly," she said to LeBard. "You 
might want to try two, 10-minute sessions." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really impressed with the results," said LeBard to Ellsworth afterward, 
scanning the neighborhood for her son who was out past bedtime. "Do you do this 
for kids, too?"

GETTING HELP IN TURNING OUT WELL-BEHAVED CANINES 
</P>

<P>
Is your best friend addicted to jumping, chewing and barking? 
</P>
<P>
Is he an obsessive people-pleaser? 
</P>
<P>
Dogs have yet to join 12-step recovery groups, and they can't attend Chewers 
Anonymous meetings. But the right dog trainer can curb most types of 
dysfunctional behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"A dog needs direction and needs to know how to please its master," said Jeff 
Hoffman, senior officer in charge of the Humane Society of Ventura County. 
"Without direction, a dog never knows what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
When choosing a trainer, check references and sit in on a class, since trainers 
are not required to be licensed. Some trainers use food as a reward, but 
Hoffman and others caution that too many treats can produce a "counterfeit 
dog," programmed to respond only to bribes. Praise, what dogs crave most, 
should be the foundation of a trainer's work. 
</P>
<P>
The following area dog trainers should be able to assist in turning out 
well-behaved canines. All classes are one-hour sessions unless noted otherwise. 
The sessions teach the basics of come, stay, heal, sit, stand, down and lie 
down. Puppies are accepted into most classes at 3 to 6 months of age. 
</P>
<P>
* Tony Rollins K-9 Academy in Port Hueneme offers nine-week group sessions for 
$70. The groups meet at the academy, 278 S. Surfside Drive, each Saturday at 9 
a.m. and Thursday at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Private, in-home sessions are held twice a week for six weeks and cost $300. 
Kennel training, consisting of private, daily sessions held over three weeks at 
the academy, cost $700. Brushup sessions are free during the first 10 days 
after dogs have returned to their owners. Tony Rollins got his start training 
dogs with a New York security firm in 1974. 986-3216. 
</P>
<P>
* In-Home Professional Dog Training in Ventura offers 20 private lessons in a 
four-week course priced at $350. Peggy Davis, a California state certified 
trainer, said the 20-minute lessons are geared toward a dog's concentration 
span. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a heavy emphasis on socializing dogs," said Davis, who has trained dogs 
for 25 years. "I want to make sure that dogs are comfortable around animals, 
people, places, noises. I teach tricks after that or work on problem behaviors, 
like chewing, barking or running out the door. But I tell people not to expect 
their dog to act like Lassie after I'm through with him." 647-8853. 
</P>
<P>
* Inglis Pet Hotel in Oxnard offers six-week group classes for $50. The classes 
are held in the parking lot of the First Baptist Church on Saratoga Avenue and 
Ralston Street in Ventura each Tuesday and Thursday at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Inglis employs three trainers who provide private lessons in residences or 
parks for $20 per hour. Kennel training costs $200 for one week and $375 for 
two weeks. 485-7140. 
</P>
<P>
* Dog Gone Smart in Ojai offers six-week private sessions that cost $300. 
Brushup sessions are $25. "My philosophy is to train in an owner's home, where 
problems happen," said Jeff Hoffman, who has trained dogs for 13 years. 646- 
9575 
</P>
<P>
* The K-9 Emporium in Oxnard specializes in teaching aggressive dogs that lack 
social skills. Trainer Lois (Lane) Kingsley boards dogs for weekend, 
intensive-training sessions beginning 5 p.m. Saturdays and ending 5 p.m. 
Tuesdays. The cost is $100. 
</P>
<P>
"I take the dog with me everywhere I go -- shopping, on errands and in crowds," 
said Kingsley, who has attended several dog-training schools during her 20-year 
career. The dogs are trained at Kingsley's 45-acre ranch on Pine Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Kingsley also instructs six-week group classes on Saturday mornings at 8:30. 
The classes, which cost $49, are held at the K-9 Emporium, 653 W. Hueneme Road. 
986-4033. 
</P>
<P>
* The Ventura County Dog Fanciers Assn. meets the second Wednesday of each 
month at the Ventura County Animal Control offices in Camarillo at 8 p.m. The 
free meetings feature speakers knowledgeable about dog training. Free handling 
classes will be offered June 14, 21 and 28 at the entrance to Camino Real Park 
in Ventura at 7 p.m. The sessions focus on skills needed to show dogs. 
642-5514. 
</P>
<P>
* The Oxnard Obedience Club has been training dogs since 1964. Eight-week group 
classes are held each Saturday morning in the parking lot of the Oxnard 
Community Center along 9th St. 
</P>
<P>
Puppies are coached in the basics from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. at $30 for the 
sessions; a novice class for dogs 6 months and older who have not had puppy 
training is held from 10 to 11 a.m. and costs $40, and intermediate sessions 
for dogs who have finished novice training are held from 11 a.m. to noon for 
$40. Advanced dogs are trained in directional jumping, retrieving and scent 
discrimination from 10 to 11 a.m. at a cost of $45. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly meetings are held the second Saturday of each month in Oxnard Community 
Center's Camarillo Room at 7 p.m. 486-5504. 
</P>
<P>
* The West Valley Obedience Club meets each Saturday morning at Valley Lindo 
Park in Camarillo at 11:30. The seven-week course is $48. Trainer Elaine D. 
Bergem once assisted the head animal trainer at MGM studios and has been 
training dogs for 20 years. 944-4347. 
</P>
<P>
* The city of Ventura Parks and Recreation Department offers six-week group 
classes at Camino Real Park in Ventura on Mondays and Thursdays at 6 p.m. Cost 
is $35. 658-4726 
</P>
<P>
* The city of Santa Paula Recreation Department offers six-week group classes 
at Obregon Park's upper level in Santa Paula on Tuesdays at 6 p.m. Cost is $35.

* The Humane Society of Ventura County offers six-week group classes each 
Tuesday and Wednesday evening at 6:30. The course, which costs $35, is held in

ALL-VENTURA COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEAM CAPSULES 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lieberthal (Westlake, 6-0, 165, senior): Lieberthal moved from shortstop 
to catcher in the off-season and quickly became the most sought after backstop 
in the nation. The four-year starter was drafted third overall in last week's 
amateur draft by the Philadelphia Phillies and signed for a bonus estimated at 
$250,000. Blessed with a tremendous arm, Lieberthal kept runners close by 
constantly throwing to bases. He also has soft hands, enabling Westlake 
pitchers to throw low curveballs without worrying about wild pitches. 
Lieberthal batted third for the Warriors and belted 13 home runs, including 
four in one game. He batted .438 with 43 runs batted in, 32 runs and 10 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Eby (Westlake, 6-2, 190, senior): Eby combined exceptional poise and the 
ability to change speeds to become an unbeatable pitcher. The left-hander 
perfected a changeup that upset the timing of even the best hitters. Eby, who 
has signed a letter of intent to attend UCLA, was 11-0 with a 1.56 earned-run 
average in 14 appearances. He struck out 68 and walked only 28 in 85 1/3 
innings. Eby is extremely competitive and Westlake Coach Rich Herrera 
commented, "Mike has an ideal mental makeup for a pitcher." Eby did not bat 
when he pitched, preferring to concentrate on beating opponents with his arm. 
When not pitching, however, he played first base and batted .316. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Herrera (Westlake): Herrera took the Westlake job in 1989 with two strikes 
against him: He was young (24) and he was a walk-on. The Warriors struggled in 
his first season, finishing 11-13. Herrera established his program, however, 
which paid off this year. Westlake won its first 15 games before falling in a 
tournament game in Las Vegas. The Warriors then reeled off 13 more victories, 
including a 12-0 Marmonte League mark, and finished 28-2. The league title was 
Westlake's first. Herrera, who played on a Rio Mesa High Southern Section 
champion and was an assistant coach for two Spartan teams, guided Westlake to 
three 5-A Division playoff victories before the team fell to Marina in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIRST TEAM 
</P>
<P>
Sam Arroyo (Buena, 6-1, 190, senior): Arroyo is a pitcher who never beats 
himself, so it comes as no surprise that he never lost, compiling a 10-0 record 
and a 1.35 ERA. He walked only 19 in 78 innings and struck out 75. Arroyo, a 
right-hander with a deliberate delivery, had seven complete games, three saves 
and batted .403. 
</P>
<P>
David Soliz (Rio Mesa, 5-11, 180, senior): Soliz pitched in all 14 Channel 
League games, posting three saves and a 7-0 record. He was 9-2 overall and 
struck out 81 in 85 1/3 innings. Soliz, who has signed a letter of intent to 
play at Cal State Los Angeles, also had 36 hits and batted .456. He played 
first base and left field. 
</P>
<P>
Dmitri Young (Rio Mesa, 6-2, 210, junior): Young, a three-time all-county 
choice, showed an improvement in nine offensive categories over last season. 
"Everything improved," Rio Mesa Coach Rich Duran said. "That's the great thing 
about him." Young led county players with a .589 batting average, 50 hits and 
46 runs. He also switched from third base to shortstop and made only two 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mitchell (Rio Mesa, 6-3, 185, junior): Mitchell, in his first varsity 
season, batted .457 and set a Rio Mesa single-season RBI record of 44. The 
left-handed-hitting first baseman also led the Spartans with seven home runs. 
Mitchell also will pitch next season. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Gordon (Simi Valley, 6-0, 160, senior): Gordon was the state home run 
leader with 15 and came within one homer of the Southern Section record. His 
total tied the school record held by Scott Sharts. "Joe is dedicated to his 
swing," Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers said. Gordon, who played both second 
and third base, batted .377 and had 32 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Falsken (Westlake, 5-9, 155, senior): Falsken was Westlake's spark plug, 
providing excellent defense at shortstop and triggering rallies at the plate. 
He batted .365 and led Marmonte League players with 37 runs. Falsken also had 
18 RBIs and 14 stolen bases, but he was more valuable because of his glove. 
"Tim made the clutch plays," Coach Rich Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Jon McMullen (Rio Mesa, 6-3, 225, sophomore): McMullen, the son of former major 
leaguer Ken McMullen, exceeded all expectations, batting .535 with 26 RBIs. "He 
is a dead pull hitter with a lot of power," Coach Rich Duran said. "And his 
instincts for the game are second to none." McMullen played third this season 
but may do the catching next year. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Naranjo (Royal, 5-5, 160, junior): Naranjo typified a scrappy Royal 
team that finished second in the Marmonte League and qualified for the Southern 
Section 5-A Division playoffs. The diminutive third baseman batted .402, 
pounding out 35 hits and scoring 20 runs. Naranjo also led Highlander players 
with seven doubles and 21 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Neal (Westlake, 6-1, 175, junior): Neal, a graceful center fielder with 
great range, made several diving catches for Westlake. He combined with 
Lieberthal, Falsken and second baseman Rick Wolters to give Westlake solid 
defense up the middle. Neal, who batted leadoff, also had 33 hits, 31 runs, 19 
RBIs and nine stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Christenson (Thousand Oaks, 6-0, 185, senior): Christenson, who had 10 
RBIs in three playoff games, emerged as the most dependable Thousand Oaks 
hitter. He batted .444 and led the team with six home runs and 27 RBIs. 
Christenson also possesses a strong arm and good range in center field. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Denger (Buena, 6-1, 190, senior): Denger was the player Buena looked to 
for run production, and the left fielder came through all year. "We pitched 
around him whenever we could," Ventura Coach Dan Smith said. Denger batted .451 
with 37 hits and 25 runs scored. He also had eight doubles, four home runs and 
23 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Cruz (Channel Islands, 6-0, 157, junior): Cruz is a three-year starter 
who has improved each season. He led Channel Islands in nearly every offensive 
category, batting .494 with 44 hits and 36 runs scored. He also had eight 
doubles, two triples and nine stolen bases. Cruz is a center fielder with a 
tremendous arm and great range. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hall (Thousand Oaks, 5-10, 180, senior): Hall played catcher for Thousand 
Oaks, but it was his bat that gained him the most attention. He batted .449 and 
led the team with 20 runs scored and 31 hits. Hall, who batted .500 last season 
before an injury ended his season, bounced back and adjusted to his new 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Hood (Simi Valley, 6-5, 187, senior): Hood, who pitched and played first 
base for Simi Valley, excelled in several areas. He batted .446 and led Pioneer 
players with 28 runs and nine doubles. He had six home runs and 22 RBIs. The 
left-hander was 7-2 and struck out 41 in 44 innings.

TEAM CAPSULES 
</P>
<P>
Pat Treend (El Camino Real, 6-4, 205, senior): The right-hander made mammoth 
strides since last season when his earned-run average was well above five. 
Treend pitched the Conquistadores into the City Section 4-A Division final and 
his 12-1 record and a 1.23 ERA helped earn him a scholarship to UC Santa 
Barbara. His 85-m.p.h. fastball helped rack up 106 strikeouts in 91 innings. 
Treend was just as eye-opening with the bat, finishing with a team-high 28 runs 
batted in. The offensive highlight came when Treend slammed home runs in 
consecutive innings of a mid-season game against Canoga Park. The final touch 
on Treend's superlative season came last week when he was drafted in the 16th 
round by the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lorraine (Hart, 6-3, 190, senior): Journalism's loss has become 
baseball's gain. Lorraine, an honors student, covered the Indians' team until 
the school paper folded last season, saving him from conflict-of-interest 
charges this spring. It would have been difficult for any reporter to write 
about the Indians without praising Lorraine. The Stanford-bound left-hander 
posted the most impressive pitching statistics in the region. Armed with an 
85-m.p.h. fastball and a biting curve, he posted a 9-0 record and an 0.91 ERA. 
He also struck out 138 and allowed only 41 hits and 29 walks in 85 innings. For 
good measure, he saved six games. He was drafted in the 37th round by the New 
York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Meusborn: Credit the first-year Chatsworth coach with knowing his team's 
strengths and weaknesses -- and those of its opponents. In the City Section 4-A 
Division final at Dodger Stadium last month, Chatsworth trailed El Camino Real 
and unbeaten right-hander Pat Treend by a run in the bottom of the seventh. 
After a leadoff walk, Meusborn ordered three consecutive bunts. The third was a 
suicide squeeze. The bunt accounted for the winning run and Meusborn, who last 
season was the junior varsity coach at Grant, became the second consecutive 
first-year coach to win the City 4-A title, joining Manny Alvarado of Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
FIRST TEAM 
</P>
<P>
Reed McMackin (Chatsworth, 6-1, 190, senior): McMackin set school records for 
wins in a season (12) and career (22). His versatility helped Chatsworth win 
the City Section 4-A Division title. He posted a 1.98 ERA and batted .402 with 
28 RBIs. He shared the City 4-A Player of the Year award with El Camino Real's 
Pat Treend. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Rosselli (Alemany, 6-1, 180, senior): The left-hander was an All-Valley 
pick as a quarterback and earned a football scholarship to Arizona State, but 
Rosselli signed last week with the San Francisco Giants, who drafted him in the 
second round. He posted a 7-3 record with a 1.12 ERA and also batted .425 with 
nine doubles, five homers and 23 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
J. B. Johnson: (Saugus, 5-11, 205, senior): Even in the offense-happy Golden 
League, Johnson's numbers stood out. He batted .444 with seven doubles, six 
home runs and 28 RBIs to earn the league's MVP award. He was one of the big 
reasons Saugus weathered the loss of Roger Salkeld, last year's Valley Pitcher 
of the Year, to win the league title by six games. 
</P>
<P>
Kendial Armstrong (Quartz Hill, 5-9, 170, senior): A two-sport star, Armstrong 
passed for 1,067 yards but contributed even more in the spring. As the team's 
third baseman, he batted .420 and ranked among the Golden League's top power 
hitters with seven homers and 32 RBIs. He will play next season for College of 
the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Benji Belfield (Taft, 5-9, 165, senior): Belfield's contributions in Taft's 
first-round upset of top-seeded Poly in the City 4-A playoffs earned him the 
award for best individual playoff performance. Belfield, a shortstop, batted 
.413, hit six home runs, had 34 RBIs, was 4-1 as a pitcher and made the 
All-City team. 
</P>
<P>
Keyaan Cook (Montclair Prep, 5-10, 210, senior): The Mounties' shortstop made 
the right decision when he stopped playing football after his junior season to 
concentrate on baseball. He led the Mounties to the Southern Section 1-A 
Division title and was named the division's player of the year. He batted .537 
with 11 doubles, five home runs, 36 RBIs and had 14 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Davis (Hart, 5-8, 165, senior): The Indians will be hard-pressed to replace 
Davis, a three-year starter at shortstop and the team's top clutch hitter. He 
batted .452, scored 29 runs, had 14 extra-base hits, drove in 26 runs and stole 
14 bases. Saugus probably still wonders what might have been. After starting as 
a freshman with the Centurions, Davis transferred to Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Nestor Martinez (Chatsworth, 5-9, 175, junior): Martinez earned All-City 
honors, batting .423. He scored a whopping 39 runs, had 12 doubles and 24 RBIs. 
He was good to the very end: Martinez scored the winning run in Chatsworth's 
3-2 win over El Camino Real in the City 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan McGuire (El Camino Real, 6-2, 185, senior): The UCLA-bound left-hander 
struck out 20 in a victory over Cleveland, causing his soon-to-be college coach 
to wonder if McGuire has a future as a pitcher. Primarily a first baseman, the 
All-City player batted .341 with five homers and 23 RBIs. He was 7-1 with a 
1.84 ERA and had 91 strikeouts in 57 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Migita (Hart, 5-6, 150, senior): The other half of Hart's double-play 
combination turned in his best season as a fourth-year starter. Although he is 
among the smallest players in the lineup, Migita led the team with five home 
runs and 30 RBIs. He also batted .414, scored 33 runs and led the team with 21 
stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Garret Anderson (Kennedy, 6-3, 190, senior): Anderson, who has signed with 
Fresno State, is a two-time All-City selection and the only player on the 1990 
Times baseball team to have also made All-Valley in basketball. Anderson batted 
.393, hit eight home runs to lead area City players and drove in 36 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Dereck Ornelas (Sylmar, 5-11, 180, junior): The Spartans' center fielder will 
return next season as a leading candidate for the City 4-A Player of the Year 
award. He was one of the hottest hitters in the region the last six weeks of 
the season and finished with a .458 average, 33 runs and 28 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Root (Chatsworth, 6-2, 170, junior): Root started the season at shortstop 
but moved to center field. He batted .388, scored 37 runs, drove in 35 runs and 
was 2-1 with four saves as a pitcher. Root was the winning pitcher in relief in 
the City 4-A final and was selected to the All-City team. 
</P>
<P>
John Najar (San Fernando, 6-1, 185, senior): Najar gave San Fernando something 
it had not had in years -- the long ball. The Fresno State-bound pitcher and 
designated-hitter slammed a school-record seven home runs. Najar batted .316 
with 32 RBIs and was 5-2 with a 1.85 ERA and two saves. He was an All-City 
selection.

ALMANAC / MILLION-DOLLAR DEALS: 2 O.C. CITIES IN TOP 15 MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 700 homes in California sold for $1 million or more in the first three 
months of this year, and two Orange County communities ranked among the top 15 
housing markets. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach and Laguna Beach ranked fifth and 12th, respectively, in a survey 
of home sales by Dataquick Information Systems of San Diego. In Newport Beach, 
there were 23 million-dollar home sales, while Laguna Beach recorded 12. The 
highest-priced home in both cities sold for $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive house of all sold during the quarter was a 
13,423-square-foot mansion built in 1935 in the Bel Air area, a 15-bedroom, 
10-bath number that went for $9.25 million in January. 
</P>
<P>
The 685 sales for $1 million or more statewide represented about a 40% increase 
over the same quarter a year ago. In more than 30% of the deals, buyers paid 
cash, contrasted with just 7% of middle-of-the-road home markets. 
</P>
<P>
But $1 million won't go as far in Beverly Hills as it does in, say, Boise. A 
late-1989 Coldwell Banker price survey found that a similar-sized, 
middle-management executive home cost $916,666 in the wealthy Los Angeles 
suburb but just $82,667 in the Idaho capital. 
</P>

MARCOS SOBS AT TESTIMONY HER CHILDREN GOT PLUNDER;

PHILIPPINES: THE WIDOW OF DECEASED DICTATOR IS TAKEN TO NURSE'S STATION FOR A

Imelda Marcos broke down in tears today at her racketeering trial during 
testimony that showed how money allegedly plundered from the Philippines went 
to her children. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing dark glasses, she was escorted from the courtroom and proceeded to the 
nurse's station for a checkup. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, her trial in U.S. District Court was delayed after she pitched 
forward in the courtroom and coughed up blood. 
</P>
<P>
Her emotional outburst came as prosecutors presented charts showing the flow of 
$28.6 million from a Bankers Trust account into the account of Fe Roa Giminez, 
secretary to the Marcoses in Manila's Malacanang Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos allegedly conspired to hide millions of dollars plundered from the 
Philippines during the rule of her late husband, Ferdinand. 
</P>
<P>
She is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice 
for allegedly plotting with her husband to divert money stolen from the 
Philippines treasury into real estate investments around the world, including 
several properties in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
As the charts were being explained to show how some of the funds allegedly went 
to her husband, who died in September, and some of their children, Marcos 
appeared upset. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Cassiday III, her Honolulu attorney, jumped up and called for a 
conference, during which she began weeping. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan recessed the trial for lunch early, and Marcos was led out in dark 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
Asked later if she was all right, Robert Fagan, the deputy U.S. marshal in 
charge of courtroom security, said, "Everything's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Following her collapse last week, Marcos was rushed on a stretcher to New York 
Hospital, where she remained for four days. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctors reported the attack had been triggered by erosive gastritis, an 
inflammation of the stomach caused by excessive acid.

LEWITZKY DANCE CO. REJECTS NEA GRANT OF $72,000 IN PROTEST 
</P>

<P>
The Bella Lewitzky Dance Company today rejected a $72,000 grant from the 
National Endowment for the Arts in protest over anti-obscenity provisions in 
the NEA's 1990 grant guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based dance company, which has received NEA funding since 1972, 
also said it and People for the American Way will file a federal lawsuit 
challenging Congress' content restrictions on grants as unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to file the suit in either Los Angeles or Washington, D.C., within the 
next two weeks," said Michael Hudson, vice president of People for the American 
Way. 
</P>
<P>
The suit will charge that grant conditions imposed on the dance company and all 
NEA recipients are an unconstitutional limitation on free expression as 
guaranteed by the First Amendment, Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal of the $72,000 comes several weeks after New York City theater 
producer Joseph Papp turned down $50,000 in NEA funding in a similar protest.

A second AIDS patient today underwent a controversial blood-heating treatment 
amid skepticism about the procedure's validity. 
</P>
<P>
The patient, identified only as a 38-year-old man named Tony from Chicago, 
underwent the two-hour procedure at Atlanta Hospital, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The choice seemed rather simple to me. I had no other options available," the 
patient said during an interview broadcast Wednesday on the Cable News Network. 
"This provides a lot of hope for me." 
</P>
<P>
The controversial AIDS procedure is called hyperthermia therapy and has been 
studied as an experimental treatment for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Drs. Kenneth Alonso and William Logan performed the procedure the first time 
Feb. 20 on Carl Crawford, 33. Crawford tested negative for the AIDS virus a 
week after the hyperthermia therapy, and his blood remains AIDS-free three 
months later, the doctors said.

POLICE KILL MASTERMIND OF COCAINE CARTEL'S WAR AGAINST GOVERNMENT

<P>
Police have shot and killed the mastermind of the Medellin cocaine cartel's 
10-month-old war against the government that has left hundreds of people dead, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The killing occurred Wednesday night in an exclusive Medellin suburb, and this 
morning a car bomb went off near a police post in the same suburb, killing at 
least two people and injuring 20, the RCN radio network reported. No one 
immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. 
</P>
<P>
John Jairo Arias Tascon, considered the cartel's No. 5 leader, was killed in 
the El Poblado neighborhood when police, acting on a tip, found and tried to 
arrest him, said Gen. Octavio Vargas, operational police director. 
</P>
<P>
The killing was the biggest victory for the government's war on drugs since the 
slaying of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the cartel's No. 2 boss in December. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas did not say if any police were hurt in the shoot-out but he said four 
more law officers were killed in Medellin on Wednesday night. Their deaths 
bring to 110 the number of Medellin policemen assassinated so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Arias, 28, led a terrorist organization that killed scores of Colombians, 
including an attorney general, a state governor, a judge and a leading 
journalist, Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
"He served as chief of the armed organization of the Medellin cartel," Vargas 
said, and was considered the cartel's fifth most important leader. 
</P>
<P>
He said Arias was also responsible for two car bomb attacks on Colombia's 
secret police chief, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
The blasts killed at least 70 people, but Maza escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities blame drug traffickers for killing more than 400 Colombians since 
August, when the government began a sweeping anti-drug crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas said police relied on cooperation from Medellin's residents to locate 
Arias. He said the person who provided the crucial information will receive a 
$200,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
The terror campaign came in response to a crackdown on the cartels that 
President Virgilio Barco Vargas began in August after a leading presidential 
candidate was assassinated and the traffickers were blamed for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Since then Barco's administration has extradited 15 drug suspects and 
confiscated hundreds of properties belonging to the cocaine magnates. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the government announced that it will dispatch 570 more police 
officers and soldiers to the trafficking center of Medellin.

A barefooted Princess Diana and an aproned Prince Charles didn't fare too well 
in the parents' race at their sons' school, but it was the spanking that Di 
gave Prince William that made the news. 
</P>
<P>
Diana shed her shoes before running across the turf in red culottes and a 
striped sweater, placing third or fourth in the mothers' race Wednesday, 
depending on who was doing the judging. 
</P>
<P>
Charles was well back in the field of fathers who donned aprons for a race. 
</P>
<P>
The day finished badly for William, 7, despite his team's triumph in a 
tug-of-war. Diana spanked him after he defied her orders by dashing off to play 
with his pals at the end of his school sports day. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun newspaper ran a picture of the spanking under a headline that declared 
"Wallop." Another tabloid, the Daily Mirror, heralded it as the "slap that 
could change the world," saying too many parents have been brainwashed into 
thinking that any kind of punishment is wrong. "But there is a great difference 
between a slap from a loving parent, like Princess Diana, and corporal 
punishment," the newspaper said.

Hanover, a West German industrial city seeking a higher international profile, 
was chosen by a one-vote margin today to be host of Expo 2000, an ecologically 
oriented turn-of-the-century world's fair. 
</P>
<P>
Hanover was selected by the Paris-based International Bureau of Expositions in 
a 21-20 vote over Toronto, the only other candidate after the Italian 
government decided to drop a campaign on behalf of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Hanover, a northern city of 500,000 known for an annual trade fair, was 
considered a strong contender because many of the exposition bureau's member 
countries have close economic ties to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau's 43 members, who vote by secret ballot, include 25 from Europe, 11 
from the Western Hemisphere, four from Africa, two from Asia and one from 
Australia. It was not known which two members did not vote today.

Business inventories inched upward 0.1% in April while sales fell 1.1%, the 
government said today in the second report this week showing increasing 
consumer caution. 
</P>
<P>
"It is disconcerting that the consumer sector is so weak," said Evelina Tainer, 
senior domestic economist with the First National Bank of Chicago. "The 
consumer sector is supposed to be the underpinning of economic growth and the 
weakness does not bode well for growth in the second quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said business sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 
$533.04 billion, down from $535.99 billion in March, when they rose 0.6%. Sales 
on the retail level fell 0.9% in April. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have attributed consumer caution to a sluggish job market and weak 
wage gains.

Domestic advertising spending is expected to total $130.4 billion this year, 
off slightly from initial projections in the face of weakening local 
advertising budgets, a prominent forecaster said today. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Coen, who heads the forecasting unit at the advertising agency 
McCann-Erickson, said in his semiannual report that domestic advertising will 
rise 5.3% this year, down from the 6.2% gain he estimated in December. 
</P>
<P>
In newspapers, ad revenue was off 1.3% in the first quarter as a 2.7% gain in 
retail advertising was unable to offset a 6.4% decline in classified spending. 
</P>
<P>
Local TV ad spending by car dealers slumped 21% in the first quarter, while 
bank and department store ad expenditures were off 14% and 13% respectively.

New Zealand's government has chosen two regional U.S. "Baby Bell" 
telecommunications companies -- Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp. -- to 
purchase for $2.4 billion its state-owned telephone company, which is going 
private to help decrease the country's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic said early today they will acquire the state-owned 
Telecom Corp. of New Zealand in a venture that will give a small stake to two 
New Zealand companies, Fay, Ritchwhite Holdings Ltd. and Freightways Holdings 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Telecom is being sold as part of the New Zealand government's ongoing 
privatization of state-owned industries. 
</P>
<P>
Ameritech is the Chicago-based parent of the Bell companies serving about 12 
million customers in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, and also 
provides cellular communications. Ameritech's assets total $19.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic is the parent of several telephone companies 
serving about 17 million customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, 
Virginia, the District of Columbia and West Virginia, and has assets of $26.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Telecom Corp. of New Zealand is the main supplier of domestic and international 
telecommunications services, including cellular services, in the Pacific island 
nation.

ANOTHER SLICE OF 'AMERICAN PIE'

<TEXT>
<P>
Not much has been heard from singer Don McLean since his big hit in 1971, 
"American Pie," but he's working on a comeback. An album titled "Headroom" will 
be released in the fall; it deals with topics ranging from kids watching too 
much television to the public's embrace of style over substance. 
</P>
<P>
After the short-lived success of "American Pie," McLean says he no longer wants 
to be a star. "When you're really hot, it's dangerous," he said. "Back then, I 
recall it being quite unpleasant. I didn't commit suicide and I didn't go into 
bankruptcy, but it was quite a swim upstream until I got my bearing." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he's pleased that he made his mark. "('American Pie' is) not just 
another song I wrote, that's for sure," McLean said. "It's a folk song. It 
belongs to the people. If children keep singing it, it will be around for ever, 
long after I'm dead."

former President if he really was Richard Nixon and then they shook hands and 
they chatted briefly but pleasantly. The topics were aging and baseball.

LIZ SMITH: WOODY ALLEN'S CONTROL IS SLIPPING IN THE 'MALL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WOODY ALLEN has sometimes been called "a control freak," but he had to 
surrender a bit of the old Woody autonomy when he agreed to co-star in a Walt 
Disney movie with Bette Midler, under the direction of Paul Mazursky. 
</P>
<P>
Months and months ago, I had the scoop that this film, tentatively titled 
"Scenes From a Mall," would happen and that Woody would depart from his total 
auteur pattern. And now the project is in rehearsal in New York. 
</P>
<P>
And guess who isn't very happy? That's right. Woody. Mazursky knows how to get 
along with Bette Midler, one of Disney's 2,000-pound gorillas, as a result of 
her hits for Touchstone. Mazursky directed Bette in "Down and Out in Beverly 
Hills." The outsider is Woody, who has seen happier days; he isn't used to 
actresses throwing their weight around on his movies. 
</P>
<P>
This will all be denied, of course. But I'm not going to retract it. 
</P>
<P>
TAYLOR JOHN, age 8, will tour in a bus and truck company of "Les Miserables" 
during his school vacation. He is the son of former Yankee pitcher and, some 
say, eventual Hall of Famer Tommy John. . . . The fabled movie writer-director 
of "Kramer vs. Kramer," Robert Benton, is going to be at the helm of the movie 
version of E. L. Doctorow's period novel "Billy Bathgate." Tom Stoppard has 
written the screenplay, and filming begins late this summer. The star is none 
other than Dustin Hoffman and his co-star will be the hot young actress Nicole 
Kidman. (You can also catch Nicole any minute in the much-ballyhooed "Days of 
Thunder," opposite Tom Cruise.). . . . While the Cruise-Bruckheimer-Simpson 
movie will make a big summer splash for Paramount, the talk of the cognoscenti 
is about that same studio's flick "Ghost," which insiders believe will be a 
sleeper hit. Actor Tony Goldwyn, son of Sam Jr. and grandson of the famous 
one-and-only king of the malaprop, is going to be noticed in this one. He'll 
also be acting at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts in the 
play "Carthaginians" by Frank McGuinness, co-starring with Kate Burton and 
Maria Tucci. 
</P>
<P>
RECENTLY, on the "Sally Jessy Raphael Show," talent agent Marty Ingels blasted 
the supermarket tabloids for their distortions and inaccuracies. He declared 
that the veteran actor Rory Calhoun had died after being tormented by these 
weeklies. When questioned by Janet Charlton of The Star, Ingels said, "I know 
-- I went to his funeral." 
</P>
<P>
But Rory's agent, Dale Garrick, says the actor is alive and well, living in the 
San Fernando Valley. Hmmm, even the tabloids have never been THAT far out in 
left field!

SIMPSON IN EARLY LEAD AT U.S. OPEN WITH 66

<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Simpson found no trouble where trouble lives at Medinah's No. 3 monster 
course, shooting a 6-under-par 66 today in the first round of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
On the longest course ever used in the Open, 7,195 yards, Simpson took 
advantage of overnight rain that softened Medinah's Teflon-like greens for two 
nine-hole scores of 3-under 33 that included not a single bogey. 
</P>
<P>
John Huston, who won the Honda Classic earlier this year after the PGA made him 
change an illegal pair of shoes, was two shots back at 68. He shot a 35-33 
while many of the field's top golfers still waited to tee off in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't see a U.S. Open like this very often," Huston said. "It's a great 
deal easier because of the rain." 
</P>
<P>
Rain and thundershowers let up early this morning after forcing a half-hour 
delay in the start of the opening round. Golfers then took advantage of the 
softening greens to make good scores, and Simpson had the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service forecast called for periodic rain and 
thundershowers through Saturday but predicted no prolonged storms. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson got to 4-under with a birdie on No. 10, then birdied No. 14 and No. 17, 
a 168-yard par-3 over water, to get to 6-under for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Huston, tied for third in the Masters this year, turned in a 1-under 35, then 
birdied Nos. 11, 14 and 15 to go 4-under. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only were the greens softer, but they were slower," Huston said. "Some of 
them are pretty severe, but even if you were above the hole today, you could 
take a pretty good run at it." 
</P>
<P>
Still on the course was Mike Donald, who got to 5-under on the backside, one 
shot behind Simpson. He had a front nine of 1-under 35, then birdied Nos. 12, 
13, 14 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Hoch was in the clubhouse with a 2-under 70. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Faxon and Ian Woosnam of Wales also had 70s. Each had 35s on both nines. 
Bill Glasson and Jaime Gomez each were in the clubhouse with 71s. Glasson shot 
34-37 after a bogey on No. 18, and Gomez was 36-35. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange, who won the last two Opens, got off to a slow start with bogeys 
on the first and fourth holes, then got a stroke back with a birdie on the 
526-yard, par-5 fifth. He bogeyed the ninth and made the turn in 2-over 38, but 
got a stroke back with a birdie on the 11th. He stood at 1-over through 15 
holes.

The National League will add two teams in 1993, and their rosters will be built 
from an expansion draft to be conducted in November, 1992, NL President Bill 
White said today. 
</P>
<P>
The two expansion cities won't be named until late summer of next year, White 
said at the end of two days of meetings by owners from both major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, baseball owners approved the San Francisco Giants' proposed move to 
Santa Clara, which could take place by the start of the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a resolution from Commissioner Fay Vincent and presidents of both 
leagues at the conclusion of their meeting, the 25 other team owners voted 
unanimously in favor of Giants chairman Bob Lurie's request to transfer the 
franchise to Santa Clara if a proposed new stadium is constructed. 
</P>
<P>
The NL may have to realign its two divisions if two cities from the same region 
of the country are chosen, said Pittsburgh Pirates Chairman Douglas Danforth, 
who chairs the league's four-man expansion committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to worry about the relative geographic locations at this 
point," Danforth said. "We're not limited in that way." 
</P>
<P>
Suggestions that St. Petersburg-Tampa and Denver have a lock on the two 
franchises were premature, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is starting from the gate at the same time," Danforth said. "No one 
has a leg up at this time." 
</P>
<P>
He also said the expansion committee will spend the next month gathering 
information about interested cities and groups. Questionnaires will be sent to 
those groups, and once the responses are evaluated later this summer, the most 
serious candidates will give presentations to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants will be charged a fee, probably about $100,000, that will be 
refundable if they do not win a franchise, Danforth said. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion committee members will visit the cities of the finalists during the 
first three months of next year and will give their final recommendations next 
June. The final choice is due by Sept. 30, 1991, but the date could be moved up 
if the process moves along more quickly, Danforth said. 
</P>
<P>
Groups in more than a dozen metropolitan areas have expressed interest in 
getting one of the NL franchises. Those considered highest on the league's list 
are Tampa-St. Petersburg, Denver and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision may hinge on the financial stability of the prospective 
owners, Danforth said. 
</P>
<P>
He said financial strength of bidders would be a major factor.

Edwin Moses, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 400-meter intermediate 
hurdles, apparently will miss the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
Moses, a paid representative for the international competition that runs from 
July 20 to Aug. 5, is not competing in The Athletics Congress track and field 
meet at Cerritos College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The meet, which opens today, is the sole U.S. qualifying event for Goodwill 
Games track events. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sears of the Goodwill Games organizing committee and Mark Parkman of 
Turner Broadcasting System, which is televising the Olympics-style event, said 
they were unaware that Moses was not entered at Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
He did not compete last year, lacked a sufficiently recent qualifying mark from 
TAC to be considered and did not file a petition to enter the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Under rules established by TAC, athletes must finish first or second at Norwalk 
to qualify for the Goodwill Games or must compete at Norwalk and then get a 
special invitation.

Eleven English soccer fans, some hurling tables and bottles, were arrested 
early today after a bar fight and a vandalism spree, the Italian news agency 
ANSA reported. All of the fans are on the island of Sardinia for Saturday's 
game between England and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
In Milan, a court sentenced eight fans -- six Germans, a Swiss and an Austrian 
-- to eight months in jail for their roles in a violent confrontation with 
police on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the defendants sat down on the bench of their courtroom steel-barred 
holding cells and burst into tears when an interpreter read the verdict 
Wednesday. They are likely to be released from prison and expelled from Italy 
once the World Cup ends. 
</P>
<P>
At Ajaccio, Corsica, three English soccer fans expelled from Italy for 
trouble-making were injured Wednesday in a brawl with local patrons at a bar. 
One of them needed surgery for a severe arm injury.

MARADONA ADMITS USING HAND TO KNOCK BALL AWAY FROM GOAL LINE

<P>
Argentine captain Diego Maradona admitted today he used his hand to knock the 
ball away from the goal line in Argentina's 2-0 World Cup victory over the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve hours after the Wednesday night game, he told Argentine journalists he 
reacted on instinct during the first-half scramble. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the ball coming at me very fast, and I instinctively put my hand in 
front of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At a postgame news conference, the 29-year-old attacker said he was not sure 
what happened on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Coach Valery Lobanovsky called the play crucial and said referee Erik 
Fredriksson of Sweden should lose his job for missing it. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona said the play happened so fast that it was difficult for the referee 
to see. 
</P>
<P>
One of the world's most gifted players with his feet and his head, Maradona has 
a history of using his hands. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 World Cup, he scored with his left hand against England in a 2-1 
quarterfinal victory. Afterward, Maradona said it was "the hand of God" that 
caused the goal, and the phrase became synonymous with the incident.

PASSION FOR SOCCER BRINGS FAME, RICHES, INJURY TO MARADONA

There is no equal to Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona in American sports, 
no one player so adored by fans of his two home cities, and so reviled by those 
in enemy cities. 
</P>
<P>
When the Argentines lost to Cameroon last week in Milan's National Commerce 
Center, Maradona was booed on every touch of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, in Argentina's 2-0 victory over the Soviet Union, the game seemed 
to come in and around Maradona like a moth to a flame. Even when he doesn't 
score, he plays the game at a different level than the rest of them, sees 
things the others don't, creates opportunities the others can't. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona, 29, a 5-foot-5 bantam rooster, didn't score, but his play was the 
focal point of much of the Soviet Union's attention throughout most of the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Before Maradona, Naples was no threat to Milan in the Italian League. With him, 
Naples has gone from 12th the year before he arrived to eighth, to third and 
this year to first, taking the championship from Milan. The triumph of the 
working class over the elite. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, attendance in Naples has gone from 20,000 to an average of 
75,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
His passion for the sport is such that it has been suggested he is shortening 
his life in order to play. He has two pins in his right ankle, the results of a 
variety of injuries over the years, and he lives with congenital back problems 
that keep him in daily pain. More than a year ago, doctors prescribed a monthly 
shot of cortisone, but during the nine-month professional season, Maradona 
takes cortisone shots daily, 30 times the recommended monthly dosage. 
</P>
<P>
The cortisone causes him to gain weight, and he recently enlisted the help of 
specialists to lose 15 pounds in order to prepare for the World Cup. All this, 
while still taking daily cortisone, plus extra medication on game days. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona is burning the candle at both ends, and this very well might be his 
last appearance in the international spotlight. He is old beyond his years, and 
he has taken perhaps more punishment than any player in soccer in the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
For his efforts, Maradona is well paid. One of eight children who grew up in a 
Buenos Aires barrio, his Naples contract pays him $3 million a year, and he 
reportedly receives an additional $8 million to $10 million more in 
endorsements. He is distinguished by his size, a stocky body that is 
consistently in motion on the field. 
</P>
<P>
And there is something else. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the biggest heart of anyone who has ever played the game," said 
Federico Baxter, an Argentine journalist working at the World Cup for a Miami 
paper. "Maradona is the symbol, the champion for our country and for the people 
of Naples, but he is also the symbol for the average man who conquered the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
He has been criticized even in Naples from time to time, such as last November 
when he chartered a jet and took a group of more than 100 for his marriage to 
Claudia, with whom he has lived with for the last 10 years. The party lasted 
long enough for Maradona to miss three games, but he has since been forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
"Maradona does what Maradona wants to do," said Naples soccer fan Lui Cavilli 
in a pizzeria before the match Wednesday. "And we let him. We always will 
accept what he does, even sometimes when we think it not so good when he does 
these things. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought us life, so we must let him live his."

CHARLES LLOYD TAKES THE COMEBACK ROAD LESS TRAVELED; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: THE RECLUSIVE SAX GREAT HAS EMERGED AGAIN FROM HIS BIG SUR HIDE-OUT WITH 
A NEW BAND, A NEW ALBUM AND A RARE LOS ANGELES APPEARANCE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At the Montreal Jazz Festival last July, sax player Charles Lloyd strolled into 
the lobby of the festival's central hotel, beaming despite the jet lag. Lloyd 
was looking forward to the next night's concert and a brief European tour that 
would culminate in a recording session. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the normally shy Lloyd is out in support of the finished product, 
"Fish Out of Water," his best-received album in perhaps 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Today at noon, Lloyd will play a special concert as a kickoff to the Arco 
"Concerts in the Sky" series at the Bonaventure hotel in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
According to manager Steve Cloud, this will be Lloyd's first official L.A. 
performance in about 15 years. He follows it up with a concert at Santa 
Barbara's Lobero Theater on June 29. Joining Lloyd will be his "Swedish Rhythm 
Kings" -- drummer Ralph Penland, bassist Tony Dumas and pianists Tad Weed (in 
Los Angeles) and Theo Saunders (in Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
The Lloyd story circa 1990 has all the makings of a comeback saga, except that 
he never went away, exactly. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to live in the now," an incurably philosophical Lloyd reasoned during 
a recent interview in Santa Barbara (he has split his time between homes in 
Montecito and Big Sur for several years). "It's important for us to live in 
this moment and live fully to do our best today. We can't change a note of the 
past, and to worry about the future is some other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I am at 51 and I feel as young as the springtime. That we must keep alive 
in ourselves -- that spirit of eternal youth." 
</P>
<P>
The Memphis-born saxman first spent time in Los Angeles during the late '50s 
while attending USC. He went on to play with Chico Hamilton, then began leading 
his own groups, including one with pianist Keith Jarrett, drummer Jack 
DeJohnette and bassist Cecil McBee. The '60s Lloyd Quartet found itself 
crossing over into the lucrative rock market, achieving a level of fame 
atypical in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
For several years during the '70s, however, Lloyd retreated from the music 
world, delving into Eastern religion and an introspective, reclusive lifestyle, 
making only a few albums. Then, in the '80s, French pianist Michel Pettruciani 
coaxed Lloyd out from his Big Sur enclave and the two recorded and toured 
together. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, Manfred Eicher, owner of the German jazz and new-music 
label ECM, expressed interest in recording Lloyd, and manager Cloud lobbied for 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I was resistant at first," Lloyd recalled. "I thought that, because 
my music is very warm and his concept is Nordic, maybe he wouldn't be able to 
capture what is in my music. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first take, this guy was jumping up in the air. When I went in to 
hear the first playback, I was bowled over. . . . My deeper soul and essence 
came through. Man, it wasn't cold. It was warm." 
</P>
<P>
When Lloyd speaks, he does so with an inimitable style and in tangential 
circles, much like a jazz soloist in flight. A complex persona emerges: He is 
at once a mystic, a shrewd businessman and a music historian. 
</P>
<P>
"My song is not about straight-on, staccato bullets," he explained. "I'm more a 
painter than a machine gun sergeant. I'm about the adoration of the spirit and 
the spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got an intuition that people are hungry for the beauty of the music 
again. Although this rock 'n' roll stuff has been promoted heavily, it actually 
comes from Robert Johnson and the Delta. It all comes from deep sources -- 
Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf, Johnny Ace, Bobby Blue Bland, B.B. 
King. These (modern groups) put a little silk dress on it and spin it around 
two or three times and then somebody can merchandise it."

<P>
TRACK: FORMER MIRA COSTA HIGH RUNNER BATTLES BACK FROM INJURY TO COMPETE FOR 
TAC 1,500-METER TITLE. 
</P>

<P>
Jeff Atkinson is back in town this weekend to compete in The Athletics Congress 
Track and Field Championships at Cerritos College and the 27-year-old can't 
wait to take a jog on his old training route, the Strand in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a dose of hometown, ocean air can help the Mira Costa High graduate win 
his first TAC national 1,500-meter title, but the 1988 Olympian and Stanford 
All-American willhave to overcome two big obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
The first is an ankle injury that has hampered his training all year. The 
second is that he will compete against a tough field at Cerritos, including 
veteran miler Steve Scott and two-time NCAA champion Joe Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
All three men are expected to cruise through Friday night's preliminary heat 
and advance to Saturday's final at 8:25 p.m. The top two finishers will go to 
the Goodwill Games in Seattle July 23-26. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to four weeks ago he told me he was definitely going to be in Seattle so I 
already bought tickets for the family for Seattle," said Atkinson's father, 
Willie Atkinson, who lives in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Atkinson was the TAC's top-ranked miler, Falcon was No. 2 and Scott 
No. 3. This year's rankings won't be released until the end of the year, after 
all major competition is completed, but Atkinson believes Falcon has taken over 
as the top-ranked miler. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon, 24, was the 1988 NCAA 1,500 champion and the 1987 NCAA 10,000 champion. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, 34, was the country's premier miler in the 1980s. He's won the TAC 1,500 
title six times and has been ranked in the top 10 since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson is confident of a good finish despite the injury and strong 
competition. In November of 1989, he tore ligaments in his left ankle after 
stepping on a rock while running in Los Altos, where he lives and trains. 
</P>
<P>
He shares a large house called "The Training Manor" with indoor 800 champion 
Ray Brown, steeplechaser Dave Frank and TAC 10-kilometer road champion Harry 
Green, a former All-American at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me three months to get back into running condition," Atkinson said. 
"I've been unable to train properly and I don't think I'll be as prepared as I 
have been in the past. But I like to run well when it counts. . . . Of course 
I'll be trying to win the race. I always do. I've done this nationals thing so 
many times." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks Johnson, Atkinson's coach since college, thinks the runner has recovered 
physically from the injury, but has yet to recover emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
"The injury was debilitating for a while physically, but the real scar is what 
it's done to his psyche," said Johnson, the cross country coach at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Even injury-free, Atkinson has never won a big title. During his junior year at 
Stanford, he placed third in the 1,500 at the Pacific 10 Conference meet and 
seventh at the NCAA championships in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior in 1986, he placed fourth in the 1,500 at the NCAA championships in 
Indianapolis. He was also the captain of Stanford's Pac-10 champion cross 
country team. 
</P>
<P>
"He was more or less a Southern California beach boy and he ended up being an 
All-American," said Johnson, who has coached at Stanford since 1979. "That's a 
pretty radical transition and transformation and he did it all himself." 
</P>
<P>
Last year in Houston, Atkinson had his best TAC national finish. He placed 
second to Clemson's Terrance Herrington in the 1,500. Before that his best TAC 
national performance was in 1986, when he placed fourth in Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson won his only medal, a bronze, at the 1989 World Indoor Championships 
in Budapest with an indoor personal best of 3:38.12. In 1988, he won the 1,500 
at the Olympic trials in Indianapolis and he reached the final at the Seoul 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
At Seoul, Atkinson led the pack until the last lap, but faded and finished 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
"My strategy is to get in kicking position with 600 meters to go," Atkinson 
said. "But I just got too tired. I went out too quick and got passed down the 
stretch." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1, 160-pound Atkinson said he considers the Olympics the highlight 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty satisfied," he said. "After all, you go to the Olympics for the 
first time and you make it to the finals you got to be pretty psyched." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Atkinson, who accompanied his son to Seoul, said reaching the final 
overshadowed the disappointment of not winning a medal. Willie was a 1947 
indoor middle-distance champion at New York's Manhattan College. 
</P>
<P>
"He was ecstatic just to be there," he said. "He was overjoyed even though he 
knew he was going to make the team. He's always been very confident. 
</P>
<P>
"At the (1988) trials I figured he had a one-in-four chance of even making 
third. I had no idea he would beat Steve Scott. We were all very surprised." 
</P>
<P>
It was a huge improvement from the 1984 Olympic trials at the Los Angeles 
Coliseum, where Atkinson was eliminated in a first-round heat. Twenty athletes 
advanced to the semifinals and Atkinson placed 21st. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal there was to make it to the final, but I still had a lot of fun out 
there," he said. "It was exciting just to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson is directing his energies toward the 1992 season with hopes of winning 
a medal at the Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"If you haven't noticed already, I make very slow and steady progress," he 
said, laughing. "It's geared toward longevity in the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Those who remember Atkinson as a skinny distance runner at Mira Costa might not 
believe what he has already accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
He turned to running because he wasn't big or strong enough to compete in his 
favorite sports, basketball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"He was under 100 pounds and a little over five feet as a freshman," Mira Costa 
cross country Coach Dave Holland said. "He didn't start to blossom until the 
end of his junior year." 
</P>
<P>
But he was dedicated and determined. At 14, Atkinson finished the Mission Bay 
Marathon in San Diego in 3 hours, 19 minutes. He also won the Ocean League 
two-mile title as a junior and he qualified for the national high school cross 
country meet as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an average run-of-the-mill guy," he said. "I was not a superstar by any 
means." 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson graduated from Mira Costa in 1981, and Holland said he never imagined 
the hard-working, gangly kid would become a collegiate All-American or an 
Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a scrappy kid with total focus on what he was doing," Holland said. "He 
would take this beat-up old plastic fishing kit box and carry all his stuff in 
it. He had a spare set of spikes and a tooth brush to clean his spikes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny because he didn't even do very well. It was like 'why are you 
taking this so seriously when you're running the way you are?' It's like he 
always knew he would run with the big boys some day." 
</P>
<P>
When he graduated from Mira Costa, Atkinson was 5-11. Despite improved 
performances and his growth, no college showed interest in him. He walked on at 
Stanford, competed in cross country and track and became a two-time 
All-American. He also got a degree in biology. 
</P>
<P>
"He always had a dream and he was willing to do what he thought was necessary 
to fulfill it," Johnson said. "He's an intelligent worker and he works hard 
when he needs to." 
</P>
<P>
When he's done competing, Atkinson wants to move back to Manhattan Beach and be 
a filmmaker. He's already done a 23-minute documentary on the Stanford cross 
country team and in 1988 he did a 3 1/2-minute film on life in the Olympic 
Village.

LONGER DISTANCE PUTS HER BACK ON TRACK

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, Teresa Barrios-Scott started on the fast track to 
distance-running fame . . . and failure. 
</P>
<P>
A standout as a freshman and sophomore at University High School, Barrios-Scott 
fell victim to so many injuries and illnesses throughout her late teens and 
early 20s that many people never expected to see her name in another race 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Others simply forgot about her. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, she'll try to prove that her name is worth remembering. Barrios-Scott 
will run in the women's 10,000 meters at the USA/Mobil National Championships 
at Cerritos College in Norwalk. The race, featuring many of the best in 
American distance running, begins at 8:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Barrios-Scott helped lead the University girls' cross-country 
team to three consecutive Southern Section championships. In track, she set the 
Orange County record as a sophomore in the 3,200 meters with her time of 10 
minutes 29.03 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But from her junior year in high school through most of her years at Mira Costa 
College and Arizona State, Barrios-Scott experienced more than her share of 
downfalls: exercised-induced asthma; mononucleosis; tendinitis in her feet, 
heel and knee; several season-long bouts with hepatitis, and a mystery cough 
that six doctors could not diagnose. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were highlights -- she was fourth in the Pacific 10 
cross-country championships as a junior at ASU -- there were many more low 
points. As a result, Barrios-Scott says she can sum up her college athletic 
experience in one word: 
</P>
<P>
"A disaster," she said, laughing. "But I've learned a lot from college. Even 
though I feel it was disastrous, I feel I've grown a lot and learned to be more 
patient and to take things one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
And her first step, she said, is to become healthy. Her last of three relapses 
with hepatitis ended in January, making it possible for her to start training 
with intensity again. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was more of a 1,500- and 3,000-meter runner in college, 
Barrios-Scott opted to run in her first 10,000 at the Mt. SAC Invitational in 
April, hoping to meet the 34:28.04 qualifying time for the USA/Mobil outdoor 
nationals. She ran 34:25, and was encouraged by the fact that she had done 
little training for the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy (with the Mt. SAC race), but I still thought I had a lot left at 
the end," said Barrios-Scott. "I had fun with it. I'm glad it was a good 
experience, otherwise I would be dreading this one." 
</P>
<P>
And although Barrios-Scott said she certainly does not expect to be among the 
leaders tonight, she is aiming for a hefty one-minute improvement on her Mt. 
SAC performance. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I had hepatitis (last fall and winter) I thought 'I'm never 
going to run again!' " said Barrios-Scott, who two weeks ago married her 
college sweetheart, miler Treg Scott. "I felt so burned out mentally and 
physically, and to be that totally out of shape . . . it just took so long. 
</P>
<P>
"And after getting out of college, it's so easy to get lost. But I'm pretty 
positive right now. I feel like I have a focus -- finally." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, USC men's Athletic Director Mike McGee announced the 
re-organization of the school's track and field programs. Ernie Bullard was 
removed after six years as head coach of the men's team, and Larry Knuth, men's 
cross-country head coach and assistant track coach, resigned, according to the 
USC athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
"Resigned? I guess you can call it that," said Knuth, a Laguna Niguel resident 
who formerly coached at UC Irvine, Fullerton and Saddleback colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"(In the track program) I was the assistant and, as an assistant, had no 
destiny. It was a pretty cold shot. We started a program that didn't exist (USC 
cross-country), and the last two years we beat UCI and UCLA in the regional 
meet. But that's life in the big city, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Knuth, who was named the 1980 PCAA coach of the year in cross-country after 
turning a last-place UCI team into the conference champion in one year, called 
his six seasons at USC "by far the most frustrating . . . that I've ever 
experienced." 
</P>
<P>
Knuth said the difficulty in recruiting distance runners to such an urban 
environment was frustrating, but even more frustrating was what he described as 
the NCAA's seemingly uncaring attitude toward non-revenue sports such as 
cross-country. The NCAA announced recently that it is considering trimming 
scholarships on non-revenue sports by 10%. That would mean men's track -- a 
20-event sport with a current maximum of 14 scholarships -- would be cut to 12. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern right now is what the NCAA is going to do with 
cross-country -- what is its future? The whole sport at the collegiate level 
has been disintegrating steadily," Knuth said. "We (track coaches) are all 
looking over our shoulder, looking at what we can do for the sport. I'm not 
burned out on coaching, and I'm not bitter. Maybe I should be, but my life will 
go on. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope for the best, I have too many years (at USC). I love the school and I 
hope the program goes in an upward direction. I am just really concerned for 
the sport. I've given too much of my life to give up on the sport. I just don't 
know if I want to make a living at it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine Coach Vince O'Boyle, who coached with Knuth at Pasadena City College 
in the early '70s, said: "Larry has so much to offer track and field. I think 
(USC athletic department officials) should have retained him in some capacity. 
. . . I look what happened to Larry and I'm going, 'There's a good coach. 
There's a good person.' You don't want to see good people go." 
</P>
<P>
Ant Attack: UC Irvine's track program was well-represented at the Corona del 
Mar Scenic 5K last weekend. Five of the top six finishers in the men's division 
were current or former UCI runners. 
</P>
<P>
John Koningh, a 33-year-old former Anteater now living in Irvine, won the race 
in 14:42. He was followed by former Anteater Ralph Garabaldi (second in 14:48) 
and current standout Aaron Mascorro (third, 14:52). Kevin Broady was fourth 
(14:58) with former Anteaters Pete Vicencio (15:21) and Sean Evans (15:26) 
fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's division, Kathleen Smith of Costa Mesa won in 17:06, followed by 
Denise Witting-Hertsch (17:42), former UCI standout Lisa Gonzales (17:47), 
Annette Cooper (18:02) and Southern California College's Sherri Hall (18:13).

SEDGWICK DRIVES AT SAUGUS TOWARD BIG LEAGUE GOAL 
</P>

<P>
As a mechanic, Bill Sedgwick was the crew chief for the Chevy Camaro that Roman 
Calczynski drove to the NASCAR Southwest Tour championship in 1988. As a 
driver, Sedgwick was behind the wheel of a Chevrolet that earned him Winston 
West rookie-of-the-year honors last year when he finished second to veteran 
Bill Schmitt in championship points. 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick doesn't mind in which capacity he works, but his sights are set on 
Winston Cup racing. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, he is driving a Chevy Lumina in his second Winston West season 
and will be one of the favorites Saturday night in a 200-lap championship race 
at Saugus Speedway, where he got his start in the street stock division in 
1979. Sedgwick, 35, won on the one-third-mile Saugus saucer last August and 
probably has more laps on the track than any driver in Saturday night's race. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen in a race, like last Sunday at Sears Point (near Sonoma) 
when we lost a dozen laps fixing a broken distributor, but I feel comfortable 
at Saugus," Sedgwick said. "I feel confident in knowing the track, and that 
could give me a little edge. I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
He also hopes it gives him a little edge toward the big dream -- racing around 
the country against Rusty Wallace, Dale Earnhardt, Geoff Bodine, Darrell 
Waltrip, Davey Allison and the Winston Cup regulars. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't set any specific dates, but our team is definitely headed that 
way," he said. "Maybe in two years or so. We tested the waters this year at 
Martinsville (Va.) and found out how tough the competition is, but we learned a 
lot and our team is getting stronger every race." 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick drives for Wayne and Connie Spears, whose company manufactures plastic 
pipes, fittings, valves and similar products. The team's race shop is on the 
Spears' 80-acre ranch near Agua Dulce, between Saugus and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
"Racing started out as a hobby for Spears, but it's getting to be a business," 
Sedgwick said. "We have seven cars -- three for Winston West and four for 
Southwest Tour -- and about 15 engines. We have a crew of five working full 
time on the cars. Chris Robinson builds the engines in the shop, and Leon 
Ruther does the chassis and runs the pits." 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick's victory in the opening Winston West race this year at Mesa Marin 
Raceway in Bakersfield was memorable because it was the Spears 400 -- sponsored 
by his car owner. Sedgwick set a qualifying record of 93.565 m.p.h. for the 
banked half-mile oval and led 254 of the 400 laps. 
</P>
<P>
"We were one of the fastest cars right off the trailer and had one of those 
nights where we didn't get a scratch on the car. All we needed to do to get the 
car ready for Saugus was put another coat of wax on it." 
</P>
<P>
It was the same car Spears took to Martinsville a month earlier, when Sedgwick 
qualified 24th and finished in the same spot in a field of 32 cars after losing 
several laps because of a collision near the start of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to qualify that high was incredible," he said. "That track was like 
nothing I'd ever seen. It was like two long drag strips connected by two tight 
turns, kind of like Saugus, only the straights were three times as long." 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick, a 1973 graduate of Marshall High School who lives in Van Nuys, was a 
weekend bracket drag racer when a friend took him to a stock car race at Saugus 
late in 1978. At the time, he was working as an auto mechanic in Los Angeles, a 
job he held for 14 years before his career turned toward racing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really taken by the races, and when I got down close and got a good look 
at the cars, I was hooked. Before I left the track that night I got a set of 
rules, and over the winter I built a street stock car for 1979. I bought a 1964 
GTO from a wrecking yard and made it into a race car." 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick drove both street stocks and sportsman cars in 1981 at Saugus, 
finishing second to Calzcynski in the sportsman class. In 1983 Sedgwick won the 
street stock division, but didn't move up to the bigger, more powerful Winston 
West cars until last season. 
</P>
<P>
He got off to a fast start, winning his first race at Madera and leading the 
series most of the season, winning twice more, at Eureka and Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran two cars in two series last year, mine in Winston West and Roman 
(Calczysnki's) in the Southwest Tour, and it was too much for the crew," 
Sedgwick said. "A couple of times there were schedule conflicts and we got 
spread too thin, so this year we decided to concentrate on just the one 
series." 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick and other West Coast drivers received a big boost of confidence when 
Derrike Cope, one of their own, stunned the stock car world by winning the 
Daytona 500 in February. It was the first time a Winston West graduate had won 
a major race in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone involved with our series felt a part of Derrike's victory," 
Sedgwick said. "I have raced against him and know what a competitive driver he 
is. He showed that people other than the good ol' boys can win races back 
there." 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- Tony Zaffino, a former Ascot track champion in figure-8s and 
bomber stocks, is setting his sights on the pro stock division this year and is 
mounting a challenge to points leader Marcus Mallett. Zaffino, third behind 
Mallett and Chris Laney, will be going for a double in the Sunday night 
Father's Day program at Ascot Park, driving in the chain race as well as in the 
pro stock main event. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- John Redican, 45, showing no signs of weakening in his bid for a 
California Racing Assn. championship, holds a 91-point lead over former 
two-time champion Brad Noffsinger going into Saturday night's 30-lap main event 
at Ascot Park. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- British Speedway League veteran Phil Collins, one of the most 
popular riders on the local speedway circuit last year, will make his 1990 
Southland debut tonight at Ascot South Bay Stadium. . . . Friday night, at 
Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, Bobby Schwartz and Steve Lucero will 
continue their tense battle. Schwartz, the national champion, won five of the 
first eight races at Costa Mesa, but Lucero has won the last three. 
</P>
<P>
LAND SPEED -- Tom Perris of Norwalk drove the Perris &amp; Eaton AA fuel 
roadster 242 m.p.h. last Sunday in the opening event of the SoCal Timing Assn. 
season at El Mirage Dry Lake. It broke a 17-year-old record of 235 m.p.h. held 
by Al Teague. The next SCTA meet is set for July 15 at El Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
CARROLL SHELBY -- The former racer and car designer, who underwent a heart 
transplant last Friday at Cedars Sinai Hospital, is progressing normally, 
according to attending doctors, and has been moved from cardiac surgical 
intensive care to the regular intensive care unit. Shelby, 67, is allowed no 
visitors or calls. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- Sleepy Tripp leads Robby Flock, 482 points to 335, in the United 
States Auto Club's western regional standings going into Saturday night's race 
at Bakersfield Speedway in Oildale.
