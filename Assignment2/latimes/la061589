AL MARTINEZ: RETURN OF THE UGLY ONE

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Freddie Torres is back on the street. 
</P>
<P>
You can spot him hanging around La Valenciana restaurant in Montebello, talking 
to the vatos locos who swagger in like fighting cocks to feast on Rosina's 
homemade chicharron. 
</P>
<P>
He hunches over a table staring into their souls, the flat face solemn, eyes 
intense, tattoos showing under the roll of his shirt sleeves, and he talks to 
them like no other preacher would dare. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, man," he tells them, "I used to walk that walk and talk that talk, but 
God got ahold of me." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, man," he tells them, "I was full of hate and rage, shooting up, getting 
high. They put me in prison for five years and gave me up for dead three 
times." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, man," he tells them, "I used to eat guys like you. I was the meanest of 
the mean, until I had a miracle." He leans in. "Look at me!" 
</P>
<P>
He whips off his shirt right there in the best Mexican deli in town and 
displays scars of combat that mark his body like dull red checks on a calendar 
of violence. 
</P>
<P>
The little gang-bangers stare in wonder at the ugly rips and punctures of nine 
stab wounds and a bullet hole. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie lets it all sink in, transmitting the horror, and then he says in a 
tone that vibrates on the sultry air, "Pray with me, man." 
</P>
<P>
And in the intense quiet of the deli, he takes their hands. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I met Freddie 14 years ago. He was a legend of evil in the barrios, stalking 
the mean streets with a gait part swagger and part boxer's bounce, on the balls 
of his feet, bare arms swinging, prowling like an urban predator through the 
hot summer jungles. 
</P>
<P>
They called him El Feo, the Ugly One, and if there was ever a metaphor for 
rage, Freddie was it. In Juvenile Hall the first time at age 7, on heroin by 
the time he was 13, Freddie possessed enough hate to fill hell and gladly 
showered it on those who crossed his path. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of seven brothers who marched through the neighborhoods like an army 
out of a nightmare. Two of the brothers died in the streets; all did prison 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie, by his own measure, was the most violent of them, inflicting pain by 
whatever means available, including thunder-punching fists that made him a 
boxing champion at three state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many people I knifed or how many I shot or even whether I 
killed some," he told me once. "You don't keep count, man." 
</P>
<P>
Then one day, the kind of day that lightning strikes from a clear blue sky, 
there was what Freddie considers the first miracle. Stabbed and bleeding at the 
end of a fight, he ran through the streets to his home, looked in a mirror and 
stared. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a mark on me," he says, the wonder still in his voice. "No blood, 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
That night for the first time in his life, Freddie Torres -- the slashing, 
raging, meanest of the mean -- got down and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
And the new Freddie was born. 
</P>
<P>
I met with him the other day at Rosina's deli. He was wearing a suit and tie 
and there was a kind of joy to the hard outlines of his face. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 14 years of that first miracle, Freddie has become an ordained 
minister in the Assembly of God church and founded three churches for 
gang-bangers and drugs addicts in the barrios. 
</P>
<P>
Now 43, he works as an evangelist in the streets, still going to the gangs, 
talking to prisoners, counseling little kids before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, man," he says, "there have been other miracles in my life. God keeps 
me alive no matter what, and I'm filling the destiny he's got for me." 
</P>
<P>
He says one of the miracles occurred the night his pickup truck tumbled down a 
100-foot cliff on the way to Corona. The accident killed his mother and 
severely injured his stepfather, but spared him. 
</P>
<P>
"If that wasn't a miracle," he asks, "why didn't I die? What am I doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
The second incident took place on a street corner in Pomona. Freddie says he 
was trying to talk a kid out of the gangs. A car drove up. Shotgun blasts 
ripped the air and the kid lay dead. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie emerged without a scratch. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not you believe in miracles doesn't matter. Freddie does. And the 
greatest miracle of all might be that a guy whose life was drenched in violence 
emerged from it to become a man of peace in a society at war. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Torres is back on the street, but this time he's got a Bible in his 
hand instead of a knife. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at me!" he says, muscular arms outstretched, tattoos flashing, and you 
can't help but wonder. Look at me!

WELFARE MOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My thanks to The Times and Anne C. Roark for excellent coverage of research, 
conducted in Wisconsin and the Los Angeles area, which shows that women on 
welfare have significantly fewer children than women in the general population 
(Part I, May 31). The fertility rate (per 1,000 women in both categories) for 
welfare mothers was 45.8, while the rate for women in the general population 
was 71.1. This is in sharp contrast to the persistent misconception that 
typical welfare mothers have many children. 
</P>
<P>
Another fascinating fact which emerges is that less than 1% of welfare 
recipients try to collect assistance for which they are not qualified. (I can 
only speculate on what the percentage might be of those of us who file income 
tax returns, or those corporations having government defense contracts.) 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps your article may help to diminish the socially sanctioned practice of 
welfare mother "bashing." I surely agree with Leonard Schneiderman, dean of the 
UCLA School of Social Welfare, as quoted in the story, "The tragedy about the 
welfare program in this country is not that it involves so many people but that 
it does so little to help those who need it."

LOW TURNOUT IN L.A. ELECTION

<P>
What right have non-voting members of society to complain about the educational 
system and the ramifications which produce non-reading and non-writing students 
when they have not exercised their right to vote? 
</P>
<P>
We who worked in the precincts were horrified by the apathetic showing. This 
deplorable record can be best measured by the scholastic records of today's 
students. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the same vein regarding the election, we who worked from 6:30 a.m. 
until 8:30 p.m. in the precincts were paid the princely sum of $35; exactly 
$2.50 per hour which has been the sum paid for countless number of years. I 
hope that election officials will take heed and correct this inequitable 
situation.

ALFONSIN STEPS ASIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Argentina's President Raul Alfonsin made a difficult but courageous decision in 
choosing to resign so that a popularly elected civilian successor can take 
office earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Alfonsin's Radical Party was overwhelmingly defeated by Peronist 
candidate Carlos Menem in last month's national election, Argentina has been 
paralyzed politically. The severe economic crisis that provoked an overwhelming 
majority of Argentine voters to turn out the Radicals in favor of the 
Justicialist Party, as the Peronists are officially known, is getting worse, 
and no one in Alfonsin's government seems capable of coping with it. The 
seven-month transition period decreed by the nation's constitution left 
Alfonsin a weak lame duck, blocking Menem from putting populist economic 
programs into action. Frustration with runaway inflation finally exploded in 
widespread food riots that left 14 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
The rioting persuaded Alfonsin that he should leave early, telling his fellow 
citizens on television Monday night that "no president has the right to 
endlessly demand the sacrifice of his people . . . " The decision was affirmed 
Tuesday by Menem, who said he will assume office on the date Alfonsin set for 
his departure, June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin's announcement was the last important decision of a president likely 
to be judged more kindly by history than by his contemporaries. In the last two 
years, he has been criticized, perhaps justifiably, for failing to impose the 
harsh austerity measures that traditional economists say Argentina needs to 
control inflation and resume economic growth. He also endured three tense 
standoffs against military factions seeking to overthrow him, and one leftist 
terrorism incident. 
</P>
<P>
These tarnished Alfonsin, the man who helped revive Argentine democracy after 
an especially dark era, taking over from a military junta that waged a brutal, 
"dirty war" against its own people and launched a futile invasion of the 
Falkland Islands. He became the first civilian leader in Latin American history 
to prosecute military leaders for human-rights violations, an important 
precedent that Menem has hinted he may abandon. The president-elect wants to be 
on good terms with Argentina's restive military, and has hinted that he may 
halt the practice of judging former military leaders for alleged crime 
committed on their commands. That would be disastrous, and would simply 
reinforce the arrogant attitude among many officers that they know what is best 
for Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Alfonsin believed to the end in the dictum that it is not the 
officers but the people who know best in a democracy, stepping down when it 
became clear that popular opinion would no longer tolerate him in office. A 
Radical Party colleague once said that Alfonsin is "almost too much of a 
democrat." That is a fitting political epitaph for his presidency -- one in 
which Alfonsin can take pride.

KAREEM: FOREVER A CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's over," said Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Playoffs, season and career all ended at 
once Tuesday night for the Los Angeles Lakers star who played professional 
basketball longer than anyone else ever had. His skyhook was a thing of beauty 
and his scoring records may be a joy forever. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Harlem, he made championships his way of life. Starting life as Lew 
Alcindor, he played on a Power Memorial High School team in New York City that 
won the national championship two years in a row. His freshman team at UCLA was 
undefeated. He led the varsity to three straight NCAA championships. He was 
rookie of the year with the Milwaukee Bucks. Changing his name in 1971, 
Abdul-Jabbar came back to Los Angeles as a Laker in 1975. The team won 
championships in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, now 42, not only played in more games than anyone else, he played 
more time, he scored more points, he tried -- and made -- more field goals than 
anyone else in the history of the game and he blocked more shots. He also 
ranked high in rebounding and free throws. A fierce competitor, he would have 
been far happier to go out with his team winning another National Basketball 
Assn. championship. It was not to be. Nonetheless, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar goes out 
a champion in every sense of the word.

FREE SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to James K. Hahn, our esteemed city attorney (letter, June 9), I'd 
like to point out that the enemies of free speech and the free press are fond 
of citing "lurid examples" to turn us away from our guaranteed constitutional 
rights. They say, "Yes, of course, free speech, but this thing goes beyond the 
bounds of . . ., etc." 
</P>
<P>
The problem with this is so many people have their own particular and personal 
hang-ups, leading to a far-ranging litany of "lurid examples." One man's free 
speech is another's "lurid example." And this is why I believe our Founding 
Fathers, in their infinite wisdom, put no reservations on freedom of speech or 
freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
Our freedom of speech and press was never meant to safeguard "Goldilocks and 
the Three Bears," or "Pollyanna." Those things need no protection. 
</P>
<P>
The precepts of free speech and press were meant to safeguard those things 
which might seem offensive to certain people, and being offended or even 
disgusted is a lesser imposition than the abrogation of those rights which make 
this a free country. 
</P>
<P>
Should a person have the right to yell "Fire!" in a crowded theater? 
Reluctantly I'd have to say yes. Because the potential harm is far less than 
giving up our rights to a free society.

LOW TURNOUT IN L.A. ELECTION

<P>
If someone told us we couldn't vote, we would be up in arms. Yet on election 
day (June 6) I worked at the polls from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and we had 128 voters 
out of a precinct of over 650. Truly a disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand . . . where do we go wrong? Why doesn't the electorate get 
out to vote? Should we have election day on Sunday? Should election day be a 
special holiday? I don't know the answers, but it seems to me that there is a 
terrible waste of time, effort and money to have a turnout of less than 20% in 
our precinct and less than 10% citywide.

OUR TIMIDITY IS WRONG; GIVE CHINA STIFF SANCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY BURKHALTER, Holly Burkhalter is the Washington director of Human 
Rights Watch. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Official Washington's response to the bloody massacre in Tian An Men Square has 
been limp and tardy. President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
waited for days as army tanks crushed students and workers before announcing 
the suspension of military sales to China, then ruled out economic sanctions 
that would have had far greater significance. And Congress has been reluctant 
to press for sanctions beyond the President's ban on arms sales. This timidity 
is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A good place to start on sanctions is a prohibition on the sale of 
high-technology items to China. In 1988, the United States sold $2.9-billion 
worth of strategic goods and technology to China. These "dual-use" sales 
included computers and other sophisticated items that could contribute 
significantly to China's military programs, but do not include weapons. This 
trade with China dwarfs the $600 million in sales of weapons that President 
Bush halted. 
</P>
<P>
The United States can and should announce that it is adopting a "no exceptions" 
policy with respect to exports of high-technology goods to China. That would 
influence far more than U.S. exports, since exports of dual-use items to China 
are approved by a multilateral coordinating committee that includes the United 
States, NATO countries, Australia and Japan. A decision by one member of the 
group to ban exports of the most sophisticated high-tech items is binding on 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
Congress also should insist that the United States oppose loans to China from 
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. That would be is consistent with 
current U.S. human rights law, which instructs our representatives to the 
multilateral development banks to vote against loans to countries whose 
governments are engaged in a "consistent pattern of gross violations of 
internationally recognized human rights." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Treasury Department, there are four loans to China pending in 
the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, totaling $5.8 billion. The United 
States should work behind the scenes to prevent these loans from even coming up 
for a vote; failing that, our representatives should vote against them and urge 
our allies to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
If existing human rights laws were applied to China, they also would limit the 
activities of the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp. The agency is 
prohibited from granting insurance and guarantees for U.S. investments in 
countries whose governments have committed gross abuses of human rights. In 
1988, OPIC provided $48-million worth of coverage to 11 American investment 
projects in China, making China the ninth-highest recipient out of about 100 
countries covered by the agency for political violence insurance. 
</P>
<P>
While American firms will probably be wary of further investment in China in 
the wake of the violence and political uncertainty, Congress should signal 
Beijing its revulsion for the massacre by suspending future OPIC activity in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's suspension of arms sales to China was a welcome step, but his 
-- and Congress' -- failure to consider further sanctions is regrettable. Why 
the tepid response? 
</P>
<P>
Bush has justified his refusal to consider economic sanctions on the grounds 
that he wants to avoid "hurting" the Chinese citizens. The sentiment is noble, 
but hardly answers the question. There was little concern about the impact of 
trade sanctions on "the people" when the United States imposed trade sanctions 
against Poland, Iran, Nicaragua and the Soviet Union. The more likely answer is 
that the President is reluctant to interfere with lucrative business 
relationships between the United States and China, and fears a fraying of the 
Washington's "special relationship" with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Congress appears to be content with condemning the massacre, and has suggested 
that further sanctions won't be considered unless the human rights situation 
worsens. The worst has already happened: Tian An Men Square doesn't have to be 
invaded by tanks twice. Significant sanctions should be imposed immediately. 
And the Chinese should be warned that further sanctions, including suspension 
of "most favored nation" trade status, will be considered if killings continue 
or if leaders and participants in the democracy movement are jailed. 
</P>
<P>
In communist countries other than China, our executive branch has needed no 
prodding from Congress to adopt strong human rights policies, including, in 
some cases, economic sanctions in response to gross violations of human rights. 
In non-communist countries with severe human rights problems, including El 
Salvador, Chile, South Africa, Korea, Somalia and Haiti, Congress has taken the 
lead on human rights. Neither Congress nor the President appears to be 
considering a sufficiently strong response to flagrant and horrifying abuses of 
human rights in China. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy towards China needs a strong dose of outrage. If the President 
can't bring himself to take appropriate action, Congress should enact sanctions 
legislation requiring him to do so.

MAGAZINES: WHAT PRICE FOR A GLIMPSE OF ELVIS' GRANDDAUGHTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elvis Presley's genes are the next best thing to the King himself, judging by 
this week's People magazine and the tabloid National Enquirer. Both 
publications feature cover photos -- apparently obtained by checkbook and by 
stealth and heralded with large headline type -- of the late rock 'n' roll 
legend's first grandchild, born May 29 in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Outweighing the turmoil in China at 7 pounds, 2 ounces, Danielle Riley Keough, 
born to Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, is an earth-shaking event in 
celebrity-oriented journals, where Elvis remains a staple nearly 12 years after 
his death. Both People and the Enquirer clearly expected to score exclusives 
with the first photos of the infant. And both believe they did -- despite the 
duplication. 
</P>
<P>
A source at the National Enquirer said that the tabloid declined to bid the 
$450,000 being asked for Los Angeles photographer Cesare Bonazza's photos of 
the baby with her parents -- partly because the Enquirer had obtained its own 
photos by secret methods and partly because the price was too high given the 
subject. The Enquirer photos show the infant alone, swaddled and in a bassinet, 
leading to the suspicion that the photos are an 'inside' job -- by a member of 
the hospital staff or of the Presley retinue. 
</P>
<P>
Enquirer Assistant Executive Editor John Cathcart declined to discuss 
specifics, including how much his paper paid for its photos. "We would not have 
paid that much," said Cathcart, referring to the price allegedly paid by 
People. "To us it wasn't worth it. . . . Elvis Presley in his coffin was 
probably a more significant picture than this." 
</P>
<P>
Cathcart clearly implied that the Enquirer's photos were the result of months 
of preparation. "We were planning for this long before the baby was born," he 
said, refusing to give details. 
</P>
<P>
People is thought to have paid a still staggering $300,000 for Bonazza's 
photos, snapped in a 10-minute session the day after birth. They include the 
color cover photo of mother and child and an inside black and white double-page 
spread of mother and father -- musician Danny Keough -- with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases the baby girl has a pacifier in her mouth and her eyes are 
closed, a source of glee to Enquirer Articles Editor David Perel who crowed, "I 
think we have the better baby picture by far." (In a third photo in People the 
baby isn't using a pacifier but her eyes are closed. The baby's eyes are 
half-open in the Enquirer cover photo and half-open in its inside picture, 
which by Perel's computations apparently add up to a wide-eyed portrait.) 
</P>
<P>
Cathcart said that "three, or four at the most" publications were approached to 
make offers on the Bonazza photos, with the bidding handled by L.A. attorney 
Stephen Spataro. Neither Bonazza nor Spataro returned calls. People spokeswoman 
Elizabeth Wagner declined to confirm or deny how the magazine got the photos, 
or how much it paid, saying, "We never discuss the nature of how information is 
obtained." 
</P>
<P>
Articles accompanying the ballyhooed photographs in both publications report 
that Elvis' grandchild was the object of extremely tight security and that the 
family went to great lengths to maintain privacy at the hospital, which had 
been staked out by photographers. 
</P>
<P>
To flesh out its story, People fell back on quotes from a December, 1988, 
interview in Life magazine with Lisa Marie and her mother, Priscilla. The 
Enquirer extensively quotes "a source close to the couple" and reiterates its 
revelation of last week that "a weird group" had threatened to kidnap the 
newborn. Meanwhile, People hinted that the secrecy surrounding the child may be 
at the insistence of the Church of Scientology, which claims both parents and 
grandmother Priscilla as members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Radiating Warmth 
</P>
<P>
The second installment of The New Yorker's three-part series on radiation may 
send a chill through people who are used to sleeping warm. In this week's 
issue, writer Paul Brodeur cites research by a Denver scientist that seems to 
indicate a greater rate of miscarriage among women who use electric blankets 
and electrically heated water beds than those who don't. The research conducted 
in 1983 and 1984 by Nancy Wertheimer is one of many investigations reported by 
Brodeur in his examination of the effects of electromagnetic radiation -- from 
high-current power lines and some radar systems as well as electric blankets -- 
on human beings. 
</P>
<P>
These and other radiation sources that have been linked to increased rates of 
cancer are likely to become the source of major liability battles in the near 
future, Brodeur asserts. One large potential source of liability may well be 
the nation's computer industry, he concludes. " . . . What will be the 
liability of the nation's vast computer industry for claims arising from 
illnesses that may be caused by exposure to the low-level electric and magnetic 
fileds that are known to be produced by video display terminals, of which there 
are now some thirty million in use in the United States alone?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victorian Victory 
</P>
<P>
One alternative to reality is a make-believe, romantic past where the weather, 
economics, politics, skin blemishes and dirty dishes are conspicuous by their 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly where Victoria magazine can be found -- in a pristine time where 
career tracks become country lanes. 
</P>
<P>
By creating an updated, spic-and-span version (no whalebone corsets, no soot, 
no grime) of the Victorian Age, the 2-year-old magazine has tapped a rich vein 
of yearning and nostalgia in the harried denizens of 1989. One indication of 
this retro mother lode is that the magazine -- which began as Good 
Housekeeping's Victoria in March, 1987, and evolved from a quarterly to 
bimonthly by early last year -- will become a monthly in September. 
</P>
<P>
The stepped-up publication schedule reflects a strong reader response to the 
magazine's editorial blend of soft-focus fashion, home decorating and 
architecture, cooking and entertaining, personal care, gardens and lush 
landscapes, says editor Nancy Lindemeyer who grew up in a Victorian House. 
Circulation is 750,000, up from a newsstand-only distribution of 400,000 copies 
for the first issue. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine has been such a hit with some of its readers that they've formed a 
club, the Victorian Tea and Garden Society, to share their passion for the 
lace, crystal and ribbon world of long ago, Lindemeyer says, noting that the 
group stays in touch via newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
While the magazine has attracted a few male readers, the majority of its 
circulation is among women interested in "reviving those sensibilities" of an 
era "when a lot of things were handmade, when you did ride a bicycle through 
the countryside with a picnic hamper," Lindemeyer says. "People needed a place 
to relax," Lindemeyer added, explaining that readers spend an average of two 
hours poring over each issue. 
</P>
<P>
In the June issue, that two hours was devoted to articles on makeup that 
reproduces "the delicate tints of old-fashioned photographs," wisteria's purple 
blooms, party dresses, a variety of gardens and houses and a calendar of 
"Events, Occasions, Celebrations." 
</P>
<P>
One of these latter items advised that "an enchanting array of teapots is 
turning a small southern city into a mecca for tea lovers and art aficionados 
alike. Trenton, Tenn., is home to more than 500 veilleuses-theieres, lavishly 
decorated teapots that doubled as night lights in the 18th and 19th centuries." 
Victoria advised that a festival celebrating the collection begins "with a 
breathtaking lighting-of-the-teapots ceremony and is highlighted by a tour of 
the treasures, parades, concerts, and, appropriately enough, lots of tea 
parties."

<P>
Let the good times roll.

JACK SMITH: GIVE ME HOME WHERE MOVIE STARS ROAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the minor pleasures of living in Southern California is that we enjoy 
the stereotype, if not the reality, of ourselves as others see us. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists in the East and Midwest are especially zealous in picturing us as 
laid-back, greedy, showy, sun-crazy, car-crazy, sex-crazy, uncultured, given to 
strange religions and illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the San Francisco Chronicle has been most vigilant in this 
unneighborly persecution, led by the ageless cheerleader, Herb Caen. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Hermstad of Seal Beach sends me a clipping from the Chronicle that is not 
by Caen, but by someone named Conti, who seems to be pitching relief. It is a 
sort of "What People Think" column, quoting several people evidently chosen at 
random at Justin Herman Plaza. The question: "Do Southern Californians differ 
from northerners?" 
</P>
<P>
Ray Cranfill, 31, a lawyer, said: "Southern Californians are more hedonistic. 
Food, beach and fun is their raison d'etre." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Jackson, 33, law clerk: "People down in Southern California, they're 
more stuffy. More bourgeois." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Kovara, 42, graphic artist: "Southern Californians are more outdoors 
oriented. People in Northern California stay indoors more because of the 
weather, and, because they spend more time indoors, they read more and are more 
cultured." 
</P>
<P>
Ada Plotner, 47, graphic designer: "I think the people in Southern California 
are more uninhibited. . . . Their clothes and hair styles are more like people 
you see on television." 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Robles, 30, waiter: "People down there like to have more fun. They're 
also more violent, more crazy, because of the amount of people. There are so 
many people nobody cares about anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Donna Montmorency, 54, telemarketer: (Remembering a woman she saw on the 
Mammoth ski slopes who had to put on false eyelashes before skiing): "They're 
basically gaudy." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Stockdale, 30, insurance broker: "Southern Californians are more casual 
and fun loving, but also very, very materialistic and concerned on show. How 
they look and what kind of car they drive. There's more phoniness. The women 
all have rhinestone sunglasses and the tousled, wild hair look." 
</P>
<P>
If we were really like that, why would anyone ever want to leave? Give me those 
women with rhinestone sunglasses and the tousled, wild hair look. Of course 
there is some truth in those allegations. Since my wife started buying my 
clothes from mail-order houses, I'm beginning to look like Don Johnson on Miami 
Vice, though not as young and handsome, of course. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, though, the stereotype is just that. It describes an extremely small 
percentage of us -- maybe 1%. There are millions of us who have never even seen 
the beach. Most of us drive Fords, Chevies or Toyotas, not BMWs. Even in 
Beverly Hills only about one car in 300 is a Rolls-Royce. We do spend time 
indoors. Otherwise how could we spend six hours a day watching television? 
</P>
<P>
We go to the parks, we go to the ball games, we go shopping in malls, we work, 
we eat fast food, we make love, we marry, we have children, we divorce, we 
study English as a second language, we litigate, we drink, we go to church, we 
work out in gyms, we jog, we go to school, nearly half of us speak Spanish, we 
have cosmetic surgery, we run red lights, we litter, we go to museums, we go to 
the Music Center, we go to the zoo, and when the Santa Ana winds are blowing, 
we get irritable and depressed and are likely to commit acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, we are very much like Friscans. They don't go to the beach as 
often as we do because they have no choice. Have you ever gone to the beach in 
Frisco? It is so cold and clammy that they don't actually get out on the beach, 
they sit in their cars, with the heaters on, and look at the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
I imagine that the ratings will show that Friscans watch as much television as 
we do, and their life styles are altered accordingly. That they do more reading 
indoors than we do, I doubt. Los Angeles is the second largest book market in 
the country, and San Francisco is not the first. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco is civilized, exciting to the eye, exhilarating and fun, and I 
have always loved it. 
</P>
<P>
That's why we're going to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary there.

LEGAL VIEW: WHEN HOUSE NEXT DOOR IS DRAGGING YOURS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not neighborly to sue the folks who live across the street, but that's 
what one reader would like to do. The problem is a house so run down that it 
has lowered property values, complains a homeowner in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Besides exterior stucco that has never been replaced, "the unpainted trim, 
lawn-less yard, broken garage door, incomplete masonry walls and vehicles 
parked everywhere constitute an eyesore the likes of which no neighborhood 
should have to tolerate." 
</P>
<P>
"A home appraiser freely admitted that my valuation is sharply degraded because 
of the condition of the house across the street," the reader continues. "Has 
anyone ever sued an indifferent neighbor for loss of property value? Could it 
be done? What might be the pitfalls? What other solutions might you suggest for 
abating such a long-running nuisance?" 
</P>
<P>
There are very few court cases resolving this dilemma, explains Robert C. 
Ellickson, a Yale University law professor, for several reasons. Often, 
neighbors are able to informally work out these disputes without resorting to 
the legal system. If that doesn't work, public agencies can often help by 
enforcing city ordinances and zoning regulations. And neighbors who can't 
afford to fix up their houses are not good targets for lawsuits, because they 
may not be able to pay, even if they lose. This obviously discourages a 
frustrated neighbor from filing suit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New York Case 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a New York case (Puritan Holding Co. v. Holloschitz) in 
which a court did award a neighbor $30,000 for the loss of property value 
stemming from the legal "nuisance" of a neighbor's abandoned building that had 
"deteriorated, become unsightly and been taken over by derelicts," according to 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
Nuisance is a legal term used to define a concept developed in feudal England 
to protect the right of a landowner to use and enjoy his land. Nearly anything 
that interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of your property can be 
construed as a legal nuisance. Loud noises, offensive odors, fumes or dust, and 
even the branches of a neighbor's tree have been ruled to be nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
"The question whether a particular thing is a nuisance is to be determined . . 
. by considering it in connection with the circumstances and the locality," the 
Supreme Court once observed. "A nuisance may be merely a right thing in the 
wrong place, like a pig in a parlor instead of a barnyard." 
</P>
<P>
You can sue for damages that arise from a nuisance, such as the loss in 
property value, or you can seek an injunction to halt the nuisance, and force 
the neighbor to fix up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
You may also be able to sue to enforce covenants that restrict the way in which 
your neighbor's property may be used. Developers of modern subdivisions often 
include covenants in the ownership deeds that restrict use to residential 
purposes only. You can use the covenants as the basis for your suit if a 
neighbor is using the property for other purposes, such as storing automobiles 
or operating a business. You should examine your title report, or review deeds 
and related documents at the county recorder's office, to determine if such 
covenants apply to your neighbor's property. 
</P>
<P>
But filing a lawsuit should be the last resort, warns Prof. Ellickson. 
"Usually, people work this stuff out by talking to their neighbors. For most 
people, that should be enough." But he concedes that some "eccentric, 
independent cusses," who are often the kind of people who let their property 
deteriorate, may not be amenable to neighborly pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be a bad neighbor yourself, by suing before you talk," says Ellickson. 
Before you even consider a lawsuit, you should be confident that informal 
negotiation won't work. If necessary, bring in several neighbors to show that 
your concern is shared by others. 
</P>
<P>
If neighborly persuasion won't work, try contacting the appropriate public 
authorities and ask that the nuisance be abated. Most cities have ordinances 
against public nuisances, and zoning regulations may limit some of your 
neighbor's annoying habits, such as storing old cars on the lawn. And if the 
public agency takes the initiative, that relieves you of the financial burden 
of a lawsuit and may not cause as many hard feelings. After all, you will still 
be neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else works, then you might consider a lawsuit. You may even want the 
neighbors to join in with you. Consult an experienced real estate lawyer. Make 
sure you understand the costs and your realistic chances of winning and 
collecting before you file suit. 
</P>

ART BUCHWALD: TORTUOUS JOURNEY TO A MAGIC KINGDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I went to Walt Disney World the other day. What impressed me the most was the 
fun the parents were having taking their children there for a once-in-lifetime 
thrill. 
</P>
<P>
I watched the beginning of the trip as I sat in the terminal waiting for the 
plane to depart for Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
A mother was yelling at her 4-year-old son, "If you hit your sister once more, 
I am going to check you in at the baggage counter." 
</P>
<P>
To my left a father was shaking his boy. "Didn't I tell you to stay in your 
seat? I think I'll take you home right now." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously the child knew it was an empty threat because so much money had been 
invested in the trip already. So he sat on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
We boarded the plane. I counted 2.5 children for every adult. Two kids were 
hanging over my seat. One had a kazoo, the other a magic wand. The parents were 
unconcerned about what their offspring were doing to the other passengers. 
Their only worry was that the children would find the chocolate chip cookies 
stored in the hand luggage. 
</P>
<P>
The father said, "If you touch that bag I'm going to tell Mickey Mouse what a 
rotten kid you really are." 
</P>
<P>
That did it. The tears spilled all over me. It's tough, I thought, to go to 
Disney World with the threat that you will be ignored by Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
As the plane flew on, I thought about all the love and planning that father had 
spent on this family excursion, only to have it climaxed by his decision to 
bad-mouth his kid to every Walt Disney character in the book. 
</P>
<P>
Down the aisle came a 7-year-old, returning from the bathroom. He didn't seem 
to be in a hurry, so his mother shouted, "Get back here this instant, or you 
won't see the Magic Mountain until you are 80." 
</P>
<P>
He weighed this statement very carefully, and then it seemed to him that it was 
just another example of his mother losing complete control of herself, as she 
did every time they got on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment a small girl ran down the middle of the plane, sucking her thumb 
and dragging a wooden duck. The father was chasing her. "For that you get no 
cotton candy, and you can't have your picture taken with the Seven Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
I thought to myself, "I can see what attraction Disney World holds for parents, 
but I just don't understand what's in it for the kids. The whole trip is one 
giant threat." 
</P>
<P>
At the hotel, the scenario was repeated. One 5-year-old child was warned that 
if he didn't straighten up and fly right, he would be chewed up by the 
porpoises at Sea World. Another was informed that he was going to spend the 
entire trip locked in his hotel room with a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. 
</P>
<P>
A third, who lay on his stomach by the bell captain's desk, was told by his 
mother that all his souvenirs would be confiscated by the hotel manager and 
thrown into the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Not since Dostoevsky had I witnessed so much crime and punishment as I did on 
the way to Disney World. It seemed as though all the children were ruining the 
wonderful trip their parents had prepared exclusively for them. 
</P>
<P>
The plane ride back was another story. The adults were too exhausted to 
threaten anybody. They had yelled at their kids for four days and now they were 
so hoarse that they couldn't speak. 
</P>
<P>
The children were marching up and down the aisles wearing their Mickey Mouse 
hats and holding Donald Duck quackers in their mouths. Occasionally, a parent 
would raise a hand weakly and try to say something, but the words wouldn't come 
out. Many who had vowed dire punishment on the way down didn't even have the 
strength to fasten their seat belts.

YOUR STAMPS: ROYAL ISSUES NOT SO RARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My topic in stamp collecting is British royal wedding issues. Do the 
Princess Anne (1973) and Prince Charles (1981) wedding sets have good 
potentials for price increases in the long term? 
</P>
<P>
Also, I am thinking about assembling a set issued for the 1935 Silver Jubilee. 
Considering that most stamps in this issue catalogue for more than $20, does 
this set have investment potential? -- R.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If anybody could see the future, they would quickly become quite 
wealthy. The stamps that you mention are popular issues, but they are not my 
first choice for serious long-term investment. These stamps were issued in 
sufficient quantities that they are not what we would call rare. 
</P>
<P>
I think they deserve a place in a comprehensive collection of 20th-Century 
British stamps, but for the long term, who knows? The Silver Jubilees are 
probably more popular to collect in Great Britain than they are here, and I 
believe that the recent Prince Charles, Lady Di and similar issues have been 
overpromoted. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Shortly after World War II, I was in Brazil, where I bought several sheets 
of commemoratives showing a picture of the Rio de Janeiro post office. The 
denominations are 5 and 10 cruzeiros. What are these worth now? -- M.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: You have the more valuable members of a set of seven stamps issued to honor 
the Fifth Postal Union Congress of the Americas and Spain in 1946. Catalogue 
values are $4.50 for the 5 cruzeiros, $5 for the 10 cruzeiros stamp, per mint 
stamp. So your panes (sheets) are worth something.

Pearl Wernick of Diamond Bar wants disposable bags No. 44 or No. 5502 for a 
Shetland-Lewyt canister-type Model A-2865 vacuum cleaner. Wernick realizes that 
the cleaner is no longer made, but perhaps the bags are. Can you dispose of 
this matter for Wernick, or will she be left holding the bag because nobody 
wants to call her on the carpet?

Leona Current of Rialto is in the market for a doughnut maker that can make six 
doughnuts at a time. (It looks like a waffle iron but has round holes.) Can you 
help without waffling around too much, or will Current never get out of the 
hole because there isn't enough dough around?

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: ORIGINAL LABELS ENHANCE THE VALUE OF OLDER SNOWDOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: We have a number of snowdome paperweights as part of a family 
collection. How long have snowdomes been around, and who are some of the early 
manufacturers? -- L.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The snowdome paperweight has been a relatively popular item among 
collectors. Typically, it is filled with water, which has a magnifying effect 
on a figure or painting inside the paperweight. 
</P>
<P>
The water may contain loose particles for added effect -- such as snow -- so 
that when you shake the paperweight it creates a "moving" scene. 
</P>
<P>
There are a great many categories of this type of paperweight, ranging from 
animals to tourist scenes to geographic sites to those used for their 
advertising value. Veteran collectors say because so many different subjects 
have been produced, it's best to attempt to specialize in an effort to enhance 
the value of your collection. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, collectible paperweights were made of round glass with a ceramic, 
plastic or wood base and stand about 4 inches high. Usually, they had a single 
figurine inside. 
</P>
<P>
An original label telling the collector that the paperweight was manufactured 
for a specific purpose or event, such as a world's fair, would increase a 
snowdome's value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cracks or Blockage 
</P>
<P>
Collectors are, naturally, wary of any cracks in the glass or any blockage that 
would obscure the snowdome scene. 
</P>
<P>
Among the earliest snowdome paperweights were those produced by the Atlas 
Crystal Works of Covington, Tenn., and of Trenton, N.J., which received patents 
for its snowdomes in the 1920s. The firm continued to manufacture them through 
World War II. Many of their earlier snowdomes had Christmas themes. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, snowdomes were being produced in Germany and Italy, many 
of which were exported to this country. 
</P>
<P>
More recent U.S. production in the 1940s and 1950s included works by such firms 
as Progressive Products of Union, N.J., and the Driss Co. of Chicago. Since 
then, many snowdomes have been produced in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
As for prices, they are fairly wide ranging. Dealer catalogues show a plastic 
snowdome produced in the 1970s selling for only about $8. On the other hand, a 
6-decade-old snowdome complete with a glass ball and a ceramic base, showing a 
Niagara Falls scene, has resold for more than $40. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have an old gum-ball vending machine as a conversation piece in our den. 
Do you have any idea as to its value? -- H.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: In this highly collectible field, condition counts for a lot. We've seen 
some vintage 1930s machines sell in the $50-$60 range. But they were relatively 
plain, in fair condition and made of aluminum construction. 
</P>
<P>
A Victorian-style machine from that same era, however, could -- and has -- sold 
for $1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Peanut vending machines from around the turn of the century, nickel-plated and 
in top working and display condition, have even sold for $2,000 and more, 
according to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Original Parts 
</P>
<P>
Collectors say they like to see as many original parts as possible, as well as 
original paint on these machines. If the paint or parts are chipped or damaged, 
there are experts who engage in restoration, which could enhance value, they 
add. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular collectible years are 1910-1940, when the globe-type peanut 
and gum-ball machines could be found on street corners and in stores and 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
When you consider that it only took a penny to operate most of them, the fact 
that many entrepreneurs claimed to have struck it rich in the vending machine 
field appears astounding in the context of modern economics. 
</P>
<P>
Still, much of the small change they collected came in during the Great 
Depression, when even pennies could ultimately add up to a small fortune. 
</P>

THE SYMMETRICAL OUTLOOK FROM A MID-LIFE HILLTOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, Times Book Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty-Seventeen by Frank Moorhouse (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $16.95; 175 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
Middle age is a hilltop from which the shapes of life past and life to come 
turn dismayingly visible. We name this dismay the mid-life crisis; a detonation 
like a star-shell that bathes the hilltop vantage in dead-white light. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-Seventeen" by the Australian novelist Frank Moorhouse is about one man's 
view from his shell-lit hill. It is a landscape of wreckage and hope, of 
breakdown and renewal, of lives and loves disintegrating and re-forming. 
</P>
<P>
Such a theme is neither small nor unaffecting. But there is a high gloss to 
Moorhouse's writing and to the character of Sean, his protagonist, that works 
an oddly countervailing effect. Sean's encounters and attachments possess an 
ingenious complex symmetry, but the life seems to be more in the ingenuity than 
in the man himself. 
</P>
<P>
The novel begins at a literary gathering that Sean attends. He is a failed 
writer who has become an official of a United Nations agency concerned with 
atomic power. It is a decline for him, and one of his many regrets. 
</P>
<P>
The writers' banter, as much else in the book, is stylishly done. They joke 
with Philip Levine, a visiting American poet (he is one of several real figures 
whom Moorhouse introduces), about the drawbacks of Australia's recent literary 
prominence. In the old Meanjin days (an Aborigine word meaning "rejected by the 
New Yorker," Levine is gravely told), Australians could write "without the fear 
of being read." 
</P>
<P>
Sean takes part in the banter, but his mind cuts back through a web of 
associations. A reference in a Levine poem to the Spanish anarchist leader 
Durruti suggests an image of Barcelona. This, in turn, recalls the Antonioni 
film "The Passenger," in which an American picks up a teen-age Spaniard and 
travels about the country with her until he is mysteriously murdered. 
</P>
<P>
It is a key image for Sean. Four years earlier, he had picked up a 17-year-old 
Australian girl; they became lovers and met regularly until she reached 21, 
when she sent him a post card from London breaking off and asking him not to 
get in touch. Her memory burns over the assorted memories that make up the next 
section of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Sean recalls Belle, another lover, who elaborated for him a theory of 
sluttishness and of herself as a "gutter-slut." This is "someone who seeks to 
be lost in the depths of their generalized sexualities." Thoughts of Belle lead 
to thoughts of a great-grandmother who worked as a prostitute in a now-decaying 
resort hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Other memories include that of his former wife, dead from cancer, of his 
inability to love her, and of the letters she wrote him as a naive, 
serious-minded and boring schoolgirl. He recalls six months of swearing off 
alcohol and lists the symptoms of enforced sobriety. He recalls a year when he 
was obsessed to near-dementia by the Jonestown massacre in Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
It is all rather clinical, particularly since Sean himself remains at a 
distance. His problems, his loves, his regrets, shrewdly described, are 
abstract insofar as they attach to no one we care about. 
</P>
<P>
Up to this point, Sean's remembering has left him as a kind of flotsam from a 
chaotic history that has deposited him, stranded, in middle age. Then he begins 
to move ahead, and although he becomes no more interesting, the book does. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling to a conference in Vienna, he meets Edith, a fellow delegate now in 
her 70s. They strike up a friendship that becomes something more. It is, in 
fact, the shadow of a love affair; unconsummated and undeclared, but possessing 
a genuine emotional and even erotic energy. 
</P>
<P>
It is the book's most original achievement and its greatest success. Clearly, 
Edith's relationship with Sean suggests his own relationship with his lost 
nymphet. The fact that the former is genuine and meaningful, despite its 
oddity, gives him new courage. 
</P>
<P>
He seeks out his former lover in London, where she has become a successful and 
elegant call girl. He had taught her, she tells him, how to please older men. 
The words are ironical but without bitterness; briefly they become lovers 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The encounter gives Sean energy not simply to recall his past but to challenge 
it. He returns to Australia, gives up his job and moves into the broken-down 
hotel where his great-grandmother once worked. 
</P>
<P>
He scavenges furniture and clothes dating back to her time. It is as if he were 
shopping for her, and as if, by so doing, he were making himself and his past 
whole. And finally his London lover, the former nymphet, sends for him so that 
they can marry and have a baby. 
</P>
<P>
It possesses, as I said, a complex and ingenious symmetry, this weaving 
together and reconciling of past and future. It is far too ingenious and 
symmetrical to be real. Were Sean anything but an abstraction, 
"Forty-Seventeen" might be truly affecting. Instead, it is a mannered literary 
exercise; post-Meanjin, of course.

Movieline, Los Angeles' free bimonthly film listings and features magazine, 
will launch a monthly publication in September with an initial 100,000 copy 
run. Hearst-owned Eastern News will handle worldwide distribution. Publisher 
Anne Vulokh says the new magazine will focus on providing "the film buff with a 
sense of the city where movies are made. Our goal is to be the publication that 
reports from the show business front." In addition to the monthly -- which will 
have a $2 newsstand price -- Movieline will continue its giveaway (available in 
theaters and selected stores) on a weekly basis with emphasis on film listings 
and existing columns.ALEENE MacMINN

Eddie Murphy's "Coming to America" finally surged to the top of the Billboard 
chart after three weeks. It turns out that the competition from Top Five movies 
like "Big" and "Cocktail" was simply too strong for the Murphy movie to claim 
the No. 1 position instantly in the first week or two, as was expected. "Coming 
to America" is likely to hold on to the top spot rather easily for the next few 
weeks, resting up for its next big challenge -- just-released "Twins," which, 
like the Murphy movie, is a member of the exclusive $100-million-grossers club. 
"Everybody's All-American," featuring Dennis Quaid and Jessica Lange, moved up 
four notches to No. 11 in its second chart week. "Child's Play" continues to 
have enormous appeal for horror fans, maintaining its position in the Top 10, 
this week at No. 7. Few scare flicks show this kind of clout in the rental 
market. 
</P>
<P>
* "High Spirts," a ghoulish comedy that some critics labelled a low-grade 
"Beetlejuice," shows early signs of being a sizeable rental hit, climbing to 
No. 16 in its second chart week.

Telly Savalas as "Kojak" and Jaclyn Smith as the newly created character 
"Amanda Vanderbilt" will join the rotating stars of the "ABC Saturday Mystery 
Movie" this fall, network entertainment president Robert Iger told ABC 
affiliates Wednesday at their annual convention at the Century Plaza. Lou 
Gossett, who portrayed anthropologist Gideon Oliver in episodes last season, 
was quietly dropped from the rotating wheel of stars because of low ratings, a 
network spokesman said. Burt Reynolds as "B.L. Stryker" and Peter Falk as 
"Columbo" will return in the fall. Savalas will re-create his role as Police 
Inspector Theo Kojak from the 1973-77 CBS series "Kojak." James McAdams, who 
produced the original series, will produce the new ABC films for Universal 
Television. Smith's Amanda Vanderbilt is a lawyer from a wealthy background who 
works as a financial adviser for a major San Francisco investment firm and 
becomes involved in the "mystery and intrigue" of her clients' lives.

HUMOR AND COMPASSION IN MESSAGE OF 'ONE VOICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cabaret performer Alan Nicholson walks on stage in a gaucho dress jacket and 
opens his show with a song called "Are You Ready?" But nobody could be. 
</P>
<P>
Those who jammed the Coronet Theatre for the opening of Nicholson's one-man 
production, "One Voice," knew of Nicholson's personal battle. But hearing him 
jump right into it with the kind of mockery one might reserve for the gout 
still comes as a shock -- and welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
Rather incredibly, the star puts a shine on the tone of the evening Monday with 
these words: "When I heard I had AIDS, my first reaction was . . . arrrrgghh! I 
first learned about it on my birthday, July 18, 1988. I had to check into the 
County-USC Medical Center. That's where you go when you don't have any 
insurance. It's for indigents." 
</P>
<P>
A little music, maestro. And Nicholson sashays into a fanciful ditty called 
"Funeral Tango" by Jacques Brel. Later he uncorks his version of an AIDS 
television commercial: "Hi. AIDS got you down?" 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson is not the first performer to deal humorously with a personal 
scourge. But he may be the first person with AIDS to turn the alphabet soup -- 
HIV, ARC, AZT -- into a tuneful entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Nicholson looks good. This is not a dreary or sentimental 
event. This is a man who refuses to knuckle under because he was dealt a bad 
hand. At the end of the two-act show, he ad libs, "I wanted to get out of 
therapy and put (the therapy) into a show." 
</P>
<P>
His running chatter is not as smooth as it could be, although his star 
impersonations, especially a lily-festooned Katharine Hepburn, are choice. He 
barely negotiates a satiric, black humor routine (from the dripping pen of 
comedy writer Bruce Vilanch) about prescribed rules of etiquette at an AIDS 
memorial service. But what salvages his performance is his affecting 
self-consciousness. Why shouldn't he be a little nervous? In a show like this, 
you couldn't cope with Mr. Slick. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's palpable compassion in some of the music. Rear scrim 
projections of patches from the National AIDS Quilt display blow-ups names of 
AIDS victims. These are wrenchingly accompanied by Nicholson's personal vocal, 
"Remember Their Names" (written with on-stage, unobtrusive keyboardist Michael 
Orland). 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson's strong suit is belting out the rousing "The God Why Don't You Love 
Me Blues" (Sondheim) and "Shakin' the Blues Away" (Berlin). 
</P>
<P>
The title song, "One Voice" (Manilow), and most of the production's material 
and technical values were a collaborative donation by people in the 
entertainment community to celebrate the power of living and performing with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The director is Sally Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
The audience was predominantly white and male. That is the lamentable truism 
about gay theater. 
</P>
<P>
But as Nicholson noted for the rest of the world out there, "It's unreasonable 
to think this crisis can't touch you." And he then sharply catalogued the 
ignorance: "AIDS is illegal in Texas, in Cuba they quarantine AIDS patients -- 
and forget about going to Japan!" 
</P>
<P>
A portion of the show's proceeds will benefit five Los Angeles-based AIDS 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., Mondays only, 8 p.m., through July 10. Tickets: 
$15. (213) 659-2400 and (213) 642-4242.

SEA HAGS TEST WATERS OF PUNK, ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the mermaid on the cover of their debut album, the Sea Hags are a mixed 
species -- some punk-rock thrust, some metal chugging and a good deal of heavy 
riffing inspired by '70s hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
What was missing was a siren's call of melody that might have lent dimension to 
the young San Francisco band's forcefully played but mostly forgettable show 
Tuesday at Goodies in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
While snarling vocals, slashing, broad guitar chords and throbbing bass lines 
certainly are ingredients of exciting hard rock, they make for a bland recipe 
if forced to stand alone for an entire show. The Sea Hags generated some 
interesting moments when those elements were applied with peak intensity. But 
for the most part, the quartet failed to channel its basic power in worthwhile 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
In the high point of the show, "Back to the Grind," the band laid out stiff 
sheets of sound while frontman Ron Yocom snarled with extra conviction and let 
the music fling his lanky body into some nice, leg-kicking dance steps a la 
Keith Richards. But the song came early in the set, and it promised more than 
the Sea Hags delivered. MIKE BOEHM

TIMELESS GRAINS; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER CENTURIES AS FEED FOR BIRDS AND ANIMALS, SEEDS SUCH AS QUINOA AND 
AMARANTH ARE FINDING AN INCREASINGLY SIGNIFICANT PLACE IN A HEALTHIER AMERICAN 
DIET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The so-called "new grains" are not really new at all; neither is oat bran. But 
in the American quest for better health, oat bran was delivered from the 
barnyard to the breakfast table. And, likewise, the new grains may be liberated 
from the bird cage. 
</P>
<P>
Although vegetarians and health-food enthusiasts long have known of the virtues 
of whole grains -- experimenting with them as a means of achieving an 
alternative source of complete protein -- most others considered them best 
suited for horse and bird feed. 
</P>
<P>
That may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic cuisines have paved the way for widespread interest in whole-grain 
cookery -- familiarizing partakers with couscous, arborio rice, polenta and 
bulgur. And today, as more and more Americans proceed from good taste to good 
health, a fascination with ancient forms of fiber -- including such "new 
grains" as amaranth, quinoa and triticale -- has begun to develop. 
</P>
<P>
According to Food Marketing Institute's annual nationwide shopper survey, 
"Trends/Consumer Attitude and the Supermarket -- 1989," Americans have grown 
increasingly aware of the correlation between good nutrition and good health 
and have undertaken a variety of behaviors to ensure that their diets are 
healthful. This includes eating more fruits and vegetables and more fiber, the 
report states. 
</P>
<P>
The survey reported that 76% of the American shoppers queried indicated that 
nutrition was a very important factor when they purchased food -- up 4% from 
last year's data. 
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in its 
"Dietary Guidelines for Americans," and the National Cancer Institute all have 
emphasized a high-fiber diet. They point to a low incidence of cancer and other 
degenerative diseases in populations where this type of diet is maintained. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most widely emphasized ways to increase intake of dietary fiber from 
what specialists in the field say is the current average adult intake of 11 
grams per day to the recommended 25 to 30 grams is to add whole grains -- 
products that contain the entire grain or as much of it as is edible -- to the 
diet. That's where the new grains come in. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is an assortment of familiar whole grains available in 
supermarkets -- whole wheat, cracked wheat, bulgur, oats, whole cornmeal, 
popcorn, brown rice, whole rye and barley -- some health watchers are turning 
to the local health-food store or the health-food section of the supermarket 
for supplies of unusual whole grains. 
</P>
<P>
Triticale, quinoa (pronounced keen-wah), millet and amaranth are just a few of 
the equally versatile and delicious whole grains that have begun appearing on 
shelves next to the barley, bulgur and buckwheat as well as in recipe books. 
</P>
<P>
Triticale is a hybrid grain, the offspring of wheat and rye. Its kernels are 
larger than those of either parent and they retain their crunch even after 
soaking and cooking. Triticale can be purchased flaked, a form very similar to 
oats or wheat flakes, or as flour. 
</P>
<P>
Quinoa, a tan-colored, birdseed-like grain is popular for its high protein and 
calcium content. It is high in the amino acid lysine, which most other whole 
grains lack, making it a complete source of protein. Quinoa seeds have a 
distinctive flavor upon cooking, and the grain is excellent in savory dishes. 
Because of a natural coating called saponin, quinoa requires thorough rinsing 
before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Millet is probably the most familiar of the new grains. In this country it is 
used as the basis of birdseed mixtures. In Ethiopia, however, millet flour is 
made into a spongy, crepelike meal accompaniment -- injera. This fine-textured 
grain has a long shelf life and an endless array of uses from pilaf to stuffing 
to salads. Use millet anywhere rice can be used as an ingredient. It may even 
be toasted before adding to recipes. 
</P>
<P>
The only real newcomer of the group is a commercial product, Kashi, a 
combination of seven whole grains and sesame. It is found in supermarkets where 
cereals and grains are sold. It is available in puffed form for eating out of 
hand or as a cold cereal, or in its original state as a pilaf that can be 
cooked and eaten as cereal or mixed with other ingredients in savory dishes. 
</P>
<P>
These and the other whole grains are basically seeds that are eaten whole or 
are sprouted, cooked, milled, cracked, rolled or ground into flakes. They are 
highly nutritious, excellent sources of protein, carbohydrates, some B 
vitamins, Vitamin E, magnesium and zinc. 
</P>
<P>
In their whole form, these grains have three major portions, although most 
contain a dry, rough outer covering -- the husk or hull. Located just under the 
husk is the bran, a darker outer layer that serves as a protective coating. The 
region toward one end of the kernel is the germ, which contains most of the 
oil, vitamins and minerals needed for growth of the new plant. The lighter, 
larger, starchy inner portion of the kernel is called the endosperm. This is 
the region used for making flour. 
</P>
<P>
In health-food stores, whole grains can be purchased in just about all forms. 
</P>
<P>
As whole berries, kernels or groats, the grains have been husked only and take 
longer to cook than processed grains -- about twice as long. They should be 
soaked before cooking. After cooking, they can be added to savory ingredients 
or sprinkled over salads. They don't cook into a soft cereal and are best 
reserved for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
Bran is the ground husk of a berry and is usually available either from wheat 
or oats. Its primary feature is its high fiber content, although some protein, 
vitamins and minerals may be present. While wheat bran is too tough to cook 
into a cereal, it is ideal for baking into muffins, breads or bagels. Oat bran, 
however, cooks quite nicely into a hot breakfast cereal. 
</P>
<P>
Whole grains that are labeled "cracked" have undergone a grinding with steel 
blades or millstones that cuts them into several small, rough pieces. Unlike 
bulgur, they have not been precooked. But cracking the kernels makes them cook 
more quickly than they would as berries. The bran and germ may, occasionally, 
be left intact. Cracked rye and wheat are made from whole grains. Others such 
as barley grits and hominy grits are polished first, then cracked. 
</P>
<P>
Meals and milled or ground whole grains are commercially known as ground flour. 
Since the bran and germ layers do not break down as readily as the endosperm 
during processing, they are easily separated from the powdered endosperm -- a 
process known as refinement. The remaining powdered endosperm is sold as flour. 
</P>
<P>
Though whole grains, vegetables and fruits provide different kinds of fiber -- 
each with a different protective function -- they do have one thing in common. 
They contain materials that are either not digestible or only partially 
digestible by the human body and, therefore, help move other foods and 
byproducts of digestion out of the body. This is believed to help reduce risk 
for colon cancer, heart disease, diabetes, diverticulosis and constipation. 
</P>
<P>
Fiber fits into the category of carbohydrates that are important for providing 
bulk to the intestinal contents. Adequate amounts of insoluble fiber in the 
diet teamed with sufficient water intake make the feces bulkier and forces the 
muscles of the colon to exercise more. This makes them stronger and able to 
function better, thus relieving constipation and its related maladies. 
</P>
<P>
Increased fecal bulk and decreased transit time also reduce risk for 
gastrointestinal tract complications such as diverticulosis (an out-pocketing 
of the intestinal wall) and colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But the importance of reducing risk for these diseases appears to pale compared 
to the value placed on water-soluble fiber and its role in lowering blood 
cholesterol and risk for cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's talked about enough," said Evelyn Tribole, a dietitian and 
spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn., who explained the value of a 
fiber-rich diet in reducing risk for inflammatory diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of whole grains has to do with increasing the fiber in the 
American diet, so we're really looking at the importance of fiber (not 
necessarily whole grains) in the diet. And there's been a real problem with 
Americans not getting enough fiber in the diet." 
</P>
<P>
She complained that there's been "an explosion of information" on the effects 
of soluble fiber and its cholesterol-lowering properties but that we may be 
solving one problem and creating another. "We need to look at the whole 
picture, not just what the craze is at one time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Sources 
</P>
<P>
Tribole emphasized that the recommended intake of 25 to 30 grams of fiber each 
day be derived from a variety of sources, adding, however, that too much fiber 
has been associated with other complications. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much fiber," she said, may promote "decreased availability of minerals -- 
especially iron" and may create a syndrome known as "bran block" in which 
intestines become clogged and form a "dam." She recommends a minimum intake of 
8 cups of liquid -- preferably water, although juice and milk also will 
eliminate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A way to meet the requirement is to consume two to three servings of whole 
grains per day, choosing from the grains mentioned above as well as other 
varieties such as corn and rice -- each with its own broad category of 
byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
An easy way to use whole berries, Kashi and firm-textured whole grains such as 
bulgur and buckwheat is to let them steep overnight in hot water then use them 
in tabbouleh or other salads, Tribole said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fiber does keep you full and satisfied; it tends to absorb liquids and form 
gels . . . which really add bulk to the intestines," Tribole said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's another theory that if the intestines are moving slowly, there's more 
opportunity for contact with carcinogens in the body. But if everything is 
going out rapidly, there's less opportunity." 
</P>

 NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: GRAINS, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CAN PROVIDE THE NEEDED 
DIETARY FIBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although there is no Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for fiber, 25 to 30 
grams per day is considered a desirable intake. This can be accomplished by 
including two to three servings of cooked whole grains and four to five 
servings of fresh fruits and vegetables in the daily diet. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat germ, buckwheat and barley are a few of the more familiar grains that can 
be baked into breads or used to complement ingredients in both sweet and savory 
dishes. They are easy to use and are an economical way to sneak additional 
fiber into the diet. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat germ, the embryo portion of a grain, is usually separated during the 
milling process because of its high oil content, which contributes to rancidity 
in the final product. Like oat and wheat brans, it can be used to coat pans for 
cakes and quick breads or to oven bake fish and poultry. Sprinkle wheat germ on 
top of unbaked cookies. Or, roll hot baked cookie balls in a mixture of 
powdered sugar and wheat germ. It will add a nutty crunch to streusel toppings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barley Is Versatile 
</P>
<P>
Barley, another hardy cereal grain, is useful as a thickener in soups, in a 
main dish or casserole recipes or as a substitute for rice and potatoes. It can 
also be baked into desserts. Barley is rich in protein, thiamine, niacin, 
phosphorus and iron. 
</P>
<P>
The entire buckwheat kernel is known to most as kasha, but it is also available 
cracked into coarse pieces (buckwheat grits), or milled into a heavy powder 
(buckwheat flour). It can be cooked like rice, though the traditional recipe 
for cooked kasha recommends stirring an egg into the grains before hot liquid 
is added. This is done to separate each grain and bring out its nutty flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat germ makes a tasty foundation for poultry or vegetable stuffing, yet it 
can be stirred into prepared pudding or yogurt for crunch. 
</P>

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: GOOD NUTRITION IS A VITAL ELEMENT FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING 
WITH AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the search continues in laboratories across the world to find a cure for 
AIDS, medical professionals are battling to promote better prevention and care. 
Nutrition is one critical element in that struggle. The AIDS patient presents a 
special challenge to the task of ensuring adequate nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition is common among people suffering from AIDS. Their nutritional 
well-being is continually jeopardized by opportunistic infections. To make 
matters worse, poor nutrition further weakens the already compromised immune 
system. Both the disease itself and its treatment can affect the body's ability 
to absorb nutrients and can depress the appetite as well. 
</P>
<P>
Against this grim scenario, the importance of diet stands clear. Good nutrition 
can help maintain the patient's strength in the crucial fight against 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, diet cannot provide a pathway to perfect health for such patients, 
who sometimes fall prey to nutritional voodooism or quackery in their quest to 
find relief from the disease. Attempting to bolster strength, many have turned 
to alternative diets, herbal remedies and mega-vitamin therapies. 
</P>
<P>
No evidence exists that these strategies are of any use, and some may be 
detrimental. The best approach remains eating as varied a diet as possible, 
taking in sufficient calories and getting enough of all the right nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disease Complications 
</P>
<P>
Several complications of AIDS make these goals difficult to meet. Diarrhea, 
oral-esophageal problems, nausea and vomiting are among the many problems. 
There are no pat answers, but experts -- such as those in the Task Force on 
Nutrition Support in AIDS -- do offer tips for maintaining nutrient intake. 
Here are several of the group's suggestions for diet modifications: 
</P>
<P>
Diarrhea: Often the first gastrointestinal symptom associated with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Tactic: Drink plenty of liquids to prevent dehydration. Water, diluted fruit 
drinks and flavored drink mixes are recommended. Diluted orange juice and fruit 
nectars, bananas and mangoes will help replenish potassium and other minerals. 
Caffeine, greasy and high-fat foods should be avoided. Low-lactose foods such 
as Lactaid products, aged cheese and cultured yogurt are good choices. Fiber 
should be restricted. This means eating white bread, white rice and cooked 
fruits and vegetables, rather than high-fiber foods. If diarrhea persists, the 
physician may recommend a low-fat nutritional supplement. 
</P>
<P>
Mouth sores or pain: May interfere with eating. 
</P>
<P>
Tactic: Cool, smooth and mildly flavored foods should be chosen instead of 
spices, salt and acidic foods such as oranges and grapefruits. Non-abrasive, 
moist foods such as puddings, eggs, baked fish, noodles, canned fruits and ice 
cream are best. For the AIDS patient who has trouble eating, one of the 
commercially available nutritionally balanced drinks can add calories. Because 
extremes in temperature can be irritating, food should be served at moderate 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
When it's difficult to swallow, single-textured foods (mashed potatoes or 
oatmeal) go down more easily than single-particle foods (nuts, corn and rice or 
sticky foods such as peanut butter). Slippery foods -- gelatin, macaroni -- may 
slide down too fast. Another tip: Tilting the head back or moving it forward 
may make swallowing easier. 
</P>
<P>
Taste changes and dryness of the mouth: Can make eating less pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
Tactic: If mouth sores and pain are not a problem, use herbs and spices to 
enhance food flavor. Acidic foods (citrus fruits, pickles) help thin saliva and 
make it easier to chew. Hard candies and gum keep the mouth moist. 
</P>
<P>
Nausea and vomiting: Can be caused by infection but are also frequently 
associated with medication or treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Tactic: When medication is the cause, meals should be eaten beforehand. Small, 
frequent meals are the best way to ensure a maximum intake. After meals, the 
patient should rest but not lie down for at least two hours. Clear, cool 
beverages, frozen ices, low-fat foods, salted or dry foods (pretzels, crackers) 
and chilled foods (cottage cheese with fruit) are all recommended. Avoid spicy, 
high-fat, fried or greasy foods. 
</P>
<P>
Reduction in appetite (anorexia): Causes include medication, infection, 
depression and emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
Tactic: Create a relaxing and soothing mealtime atmosphere. If possible, the 
patient should eat with a friend and choose favorite foods. Smaller meals eaten 
more often during the day, frequent snacks and an instant breakfast shake 
between meals may help boost caloric intake. 
</P>
<P>
Because symptoms and complications of AIDS are unique for each patient, no set 
of guidelines applies to everybody. If efforts to maintain adequate nutrition 
fail to meet the mark, a physician or registered dietitian should be consulted. 
They may suggest a commercial formula or food product to augment the diet. In 
severe cases, other forms of nutritional support may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Macadamia Nuts: Slim Chance of Low Calories 
</P>
<P>
Question: Are macadamia nuts higher in calories than other nuts? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes. Nuts in general are notoriously high in fat, and therefore high in 
calories. Nevertheless, there are differences among them. A cup of macadamias 
contains about 940 calories and nearly 100 grams of fat, almost seven 
tablespoons -- nearly the equivalent of half a stick of butter. 
</P>
<P>
Moving down the caloric ladder, a cup of almonds has about 835 calories; a cup 
of walnuts, 770. A cup of pecans or filberts contains 725 calories. Fat ranges 
from 70 to 75 grams in a cup of any of these nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Nuts also contain protein, some more than others. For example, a cup of pecans 
has just eight grams of protein, about the same as in an ounce of meat, while a 
cup of almonds provides almost four times that much, or 28 grams. Macadamia 
nuts weigh in at the low end. They contain just 11 grams of protein. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any evidence that people who are more active physically are less 
likely to be depressed? 
</P>
<P>
A: More research is needed, but so far the answer seems to be yes. That was the 
conclusion reached by Kenneth E. Powell and co-workers at the Centers for 
Disease Control when they recently reviewed available evidence about the link 
between activity and depression. 
</P>
<P>
As they point out, the difficulty begins with the fact that criteria for 
diagnosing depression are much less precise than those for other chronic 
diseases such as coronary heart disease or cancer. Beyond that, depression only 
rarely has a fatal outcome: Less than 1% of those who suffer from clinical 
depression commit suicide. So, in the overwhelming majority of cases, changes 
in symptoms are what must be measured, a task that is very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Several types of inquiries have been conducted since the beginning of the 
decade. Four population surveys, three of them from Canada and one from the 
United States, found that people who were more active were indeed happier. 
Additionally, one of the Canadian studies, which also obtained information 
about household chores, found a diminished association between activity and 
positive-affect scores when both chores and leisure activity were measured 
together. This suggests that leisure-time activity, assumed to be self-chosen, 
may affect mood more positively than obligatory activity. 
</P>
<P>
Other studies have compared the therapeutic effects of exercise to standard 
therapy on depressed individuals. Those randomly assigned to a jogging program 
improved as much or more than those assigned to other forms of therapy, 
including group therapy, counseling or meditation with a therapist. 
</P>
<P>
However, conclusions are limited by the fact that a therapist participated in 
the group. In two other studies of women college students, aerobic exercise and 
swimming were found to improve depressive symptoms. Using information from a 
follow-up study of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 
women who were classified as not active at the time of the original survey were 
twice as likely to be depressed eight years later than those who were active. 
</P>
<P>
The authors of the review conclude that available evidence does suggest that 
physical activity reduces depressive symptoms and improves mood. But they 
caution that a clearer definition of the relationship depends on better 
definition of depression and measurements of physical activity.

 BACK TO BASICS: FOR FRESH PINEAPPLE CHOOSE PLUMP, FIRM FRUIT WITH SWEET AROMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When choosing a fresh pineapple, select fruit that's plump and firm with fresh 
green leaves in the crown. The pineapple should have a sweet aroma, and no mold 
or soft spots. 
</P>
<P>
Shell color is not a good sign of maturity -- some pineapple varieties remain 
green even when they are fully ripe. And forget pulling leaves out of the 
crown; ease of extraction is not an indication of either ripeness or quality. 
</P>
<P>
Once a pineapple is harvested from the plant, it will not ripen any further. It 
will change color, get soft and the leaves will fall out, but these are signs 
of old age, not ripeness. The fruit should be used as soon as possible after 
purchase but may be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated three to five days. 
</P>
<P>
There are numerous ways to prepare fresh pineapple. The following method is an 
easy way of cutting chunks, spears and wedges. 
</P>
<P>
Step 1. Using a long, sharp knife, cut the pineapple in half lengthwise from 
the bottom through the crown. Repeat, cutting pineapple into quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Step 2. Trim the strip of hard core from the top of each quarter. Then cut the 
fruit away from the shell. A curved pineapple knife is ideal for this step but 
a sturdy grapefruit knife or standard serrated knife may be used. 
</P>
<P>
Step 3. Cut the fruit into chunks, wedges or spears. Remove the fruit or use 
the shell as a serving container. 
</P>
<P>
A reminder: Fresh pineapple contains the enzyme bromelin, which breaks down 
protein. Used in marinades it helps tenderize meats, but it also prevents 
gelatin from setting. The enzyme is destroyed by cooking, so canned pineapple 
may be used in gelatin salads and desserts.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: SPECIALTY COOKWARE FOR MEAT AND POTATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Specialty cookware -- who needs it? Far beyond ordinary pots and pans, there 
exist some creative cooking vessels designed for specific needs. Blessed are 
those fortunate individuals who have extra shelf space to accommodate these 
utensils as they just might find them to be of wonderful service on certain 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Or possibly daily use, as in the case of the Potato Devil, otherwise known as 
Kartoffel Teufel in West Germany. If you're a baked potato fan and realize that 
boiling this nutritious tuber in salty water can destroy its nutrient values, 
check into this clay cookware ($34.99) that cooks potatoes on top of the stove 
without any water. For others, the fond attachment for baked potatoes may come 
simply just from taste appeal. The Potato Devil browns and cooks potatoes with 
a kind of roasted "campfire" flavor. Manufactured by Kartoffelteufel 
International Ltd. in West Germany and imported by Swiss Mar Imports Ltd., the 
ivory or sand colored cookware features two "twin" flat-bottomed but 
round-sided clay pots with handles that can accommodate up to three pounds of 
potatoes. It works this way: Fill one pot (it must be very dry) with floury 
potatoes (take advantage of Russets, which are in abundance right now) and 
cover with the other pot. Place on an electric or gas stove, putting the 
provided asbestos mat between the heat source and pot. Cook over medium heat 
about 30 minutes then turn pot over and cook another half an hour without 
opening, to seal in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Save Fuel 
</P>
<P>
This method doesn't save time, or fuel either; however, it produces charred 
patches on the potatoes that give them the aroma and taste of being baked in 
the ashes of an open fire. And don't worry about keeping the pot pristine 
looking upon repeated use. A dark coating will form right away on the inside of 
the Potato Devil, which actually helps to impart that special taste. The 
manufacturer also advises against the use of detergents or abrasives. To 
prevent cracking, the pot should be allowed to cool before washing. 
</P>
<P>
The microwave oven has been a godsend appliance since its introduction and now 
most people can't live without it even just for daily reheating, defrosting or 
boiling water for coffee or tea. General Housewares Corp., a major cookware 
manufacturer, found a niche for microwave-related cookware that goes a step 
above the common usage of this heating unit. Nic Bruns, product manager at 
General Housewares in Indiana, said, "We did a lot of research on what 
consumers use the microwave for. We felt that they didn't use it to cook real 
food. They were not getting their money's worth." 
</P>
<P>
That triggered the development of the Magnawave Perfection Microwave Roaster 
($39.99). "There was a great need for a roaster," Bruns added, "for busy people 
to be able to cook a roast in half an hour, or at least half the time it takes 
in a regular oven." Oval in shape and deep, the almond colored microwave 
roaster is made of lightweight ceramic on steel. It includes an oval metal rack 
designed with large holes and a smoked glass dome lid. The product, which has a 
lifetime limited warranty, can also be used on top of the stove as well as in 
the conventional oven. 
</P>
<P>
Although a little steam is important in roasting for juiciness, it becomes an 
enemy in achieving browning and crisping. This is the reason why up until now, 
roasting has been tabooed in the microwave, which functions more like a steam 
cooker. 
</P>
<P>
The Magnawave roaster will cook and brown pork, lamb and beef roasts, meat 
loaf, ham, chicken or duck. The meat is placed on the aluminum rack and covered 
with a tempered glass lid. This dome lid doesn't seal the edges of the pan 
completely, effecting a vent that lets steam formed above the metal rack escape 
during cooking. For more even cooking, the meat should be turned halfway during 
cooking. As the meat is cooked, the juices drain below the rack and are trapped 
in an area surrounded by metal in which they cannot be boiled and/or create 
steam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precaution Against Salmonella 
</P>
<P>
Because the juices do not reach a boiling point, the manufacturer recommends 
that these juices should not touch the meat and should either be discarded or 
boiled separately for gravy after the meat is removed. Another precaution that 
guards against salmonella bacteria when roasting fowl is to avoid covering the 
large holes around the rack edge with the chicken. These holes were designed to 
allow microwave energy into the lower cavity in order to pasteurize the juices 
at a temperature of 140 degrees for four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest concerns with this product breakthrough is the use of metal 
in the rack. Bruns explained that as long as the microwave unit is in perfect 
working condition, the magnetrons in the microwave ovens cannot be damaged by 
the use of the metal. Also, before using the roaster it is of utmost importance 
to read the instruction booklet carefully. One of the most significant 
precautions is not to cook food loads that weigh under two pounds, nor do they 
recommend cooking flat foods such as steak or flattened chicken parts, 
regardless of weight. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of doneness, Bruns said, "Treat the recipe like you would cooking in a 
normal oven, cooking longer when necessary. The higher the wattage of the oven, 
the better the results" For guidelines, a convenient roasting chart is included 
in the booklet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Potato Devil is available at Cookin Stuff (Palos Verdes and La Habra), 
Kitchen Kitchen (Rancho Mirage) and The Yellow Door (Rolling Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 The Magnawave Perfection Microwave Roaster is available at Robinson's, May 
Company, K mart and Fedco.

MICROWAVE . . .: ADDING PEP TO FRESH GREEN PEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best green peas you'll ever eat are those from your local farmer's market 
or, better yet, your own garden, picked and shelled minutes before microwaving. 
</P>
<P>
The great advantage of the microwave is that you needn't drown the peas in 
water as you must if you cook them on top of the stove. 
</P>
<P>
If you add a nugget of butter to the casserole in which you'll microwave them, 
you needn't add any water at all (let your calorie-consciousness be your 
guide). In a closed container, the peas will steam in their own fragrant vapor 
so that their original goodness is not only preserved but heightened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Something Special 
</P>
<P>
Here's a recipe for turning snow pea pods into something special. 
</P>
<P>
You'll get about one cup shelled peas from each pound unshelled peas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDONESIAN SNOW PEAS IN PEANUT SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
1 large sweet red pepper, cored, seeded and cut in 2x1/8-inch strips 
</P>
<P>
4 green onions, cut diagonally into 1/2-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons dark sesame oil 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound snow peas 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon minced ginger root 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons chunky peanut butter 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
Combine red pepper, green onions, garlic and oil in 2-quart casserole at least 
9-inches across. Cover with wax paper and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 3 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Stir, add snow peas and ginger, cover with lid or vented plastic wrap and 
microwave on HIGH 3 to 4 minutes, stirring at half time, until snow peas are 
barely tender. Let stand, covered, 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spoon peanut butter into 1-cup measure, add soy sauce, cover with 
wax paper and microwave on HIGH 1 minute. 
</P>
<P>
Drain vegetable liquid into sauce, whisk until smooth, pour over vegetables and 
toss lightly. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: For Warm Snow Pea, Mushroom and Red Pepper Salad With Ginger-Honey 
Dressing, cook red pepper, green onions and garlic in oil as directed, then 
toss with 1 cup halved raw button mushrooms. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave 1/2 pound snow peas as directed, but without seasoning. Drain and set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
Beat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil with 1 tablespoon white vinegar, 2 teaspoons 
honey, 1/2 teaspoon crushed ginger root, 1/2 teaspoon crushed garlic, 1/4 
teaspoon salt and dash red pepper flakes in small bowl. Spoon 1/2 dressing over 
pepper mixture and toss. Pour remaining dressing over peas. 
</P>
<P>
Mound red pepper mixture in center of round platter and arrange peas around 
pepper mixture. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

CULTURAL EXCHANGE BANISHES STEREOTYPICAL VIEW OF MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curtis Woodhouse was sure that the worst of Tijuana in the old days was what 
the rest of Mexico must look like. But he doesn't think so anymore, not since 
he visited the country with a group of UCLA classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us had really not experienced Mexico. Some people had been to the 
border. . . . (The trip broke) down a lot of stereotypical barriers," said 
Woodhouse, who visited Mexico earlier this year. "There is a whole language of 
architecture there that really has nothing to do with what you see" in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Together with 35 other students from the UCLA Graduate School of Architecture 
and the Universidad La Iberoamericana in Mexico City, Woodhouse took part in a 
cultural exchange program aimed at fostering a better understanding between 
Mexico and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The students were instructed to design a community center for the city of 
Patzcuaro, complete with workshop areas, a school of tourism and a medical 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups of students met in Mexico City in February. The contingent from 
UCLA stayed with students from La Ibero, who introduced their American 
counterparts to the elegant Colonial patios and private courtyards where 
Mexican families like to spend their time. 
</P>
<P>
After three days in Mexico City, the students and their professors took an 
all-night train ride to Patzcuaro, a centuries-old city in the state of 
Michoacan in central Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all goggle-eyed, especially the Americans. Mexican architecture is 
soul-stirring," said Rafael Serrano, a Spaniard who studies at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to looking for an approach that would blend into the surrounding 
area as well as enhance its architectural heritage, the students gained 
valuable experience in human interaction, according to Ricardo Legorreta, a 
well-known Mexican architect who teaches at UCLA and La Ibero. 
</P>
<P>
By living together for eight days in Mexico in February and for a week in Los 
Angeles in April, the students got to know one another better, said Legorreta, 
who coordinated the program. 
</P>
<P>
Sofia Vivas from La Ibero and Rick Mascia from UCLA, for instance, struck up a 
friendship in Mexico City and upon meeting again in Los Angeles said they had 
shared the same worries, goals and aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Other students focused on their differences. 
</P>
<P>
"In trying to preserve things as archeological elements (the Americans) show a 
nostalgic tendency that causes their designs to lose character," Jose Maria 
Nava from La Ibero said about traditional approaches to the project. 
</P>
<P>
"People who live in Mexico may not realize how unique their culture is. . . . 
Coming from somewhere else, we can appreciate it and realize the importance of 
preserving it," Sheila Spencer from UCLA suggested. 
</P>
<P>
For Jorge Ballina Garza, architecture dean at La Ibero, the exchange was 
positive because "contact with other people (from different nationalities) 
makes one think back on one's values. (Others) see things one is liable to 
overlook." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anita Mermel, assistant dean at the UCLA School of Architecture, 
added that the trip awoke the students to a new area of architecture that has 
probably become as valuable to them as the culture itself. 
</P>
<P>
Mermel also hopes publicity from the exchange will attract more Latino students 
to the school. Latinos account for 8% of the student body at the School of 
Architecture. 
</P>
<P>
But the exchange ended with an ironic twist since the students' designs are not 
going to be used for practical purposes. Scale models of their designs were 
displayed at UCLA in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
"Patzcuaro does not have the financial capability to build a community center. 
Neither has there been a request by the (Mexican) government to do the work," 
Ballina Garza said. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the students added, it was all for the sake of completing an 
academic exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"The student has to brainstorm in order to understand many things. It's part of 
the course and of the speculation that goes with it," Rocio Suarez from La 
Ibero said. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the inability to go ahead with the construction phase of the 
project raised at worst a few complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very special feeling because one already knows the project is not 
going to be built, but one still wishes it could be . . . " Nava said. "It is a 
feeling of frustrated resignation."

CHILEANS IN 2 CAMPS SHARE ABIDING TIES TO DISTANT LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAFAEL PRIETO ZARTHA, Prieto Zartha is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past 14 years, traditional celebrations have been held in two different 
parts of Los Angeles, with the participants paying homage to their red, white 
and blue Chilean flag and singing their anthem. 
</P>
<P>
The mood and feeling of the two mid-September celebrations not only demonstrate 
the love Chileans have for their distant country, but also clearly reveal a 
rift in the Los Angeles colony. 
</P>
<P>
In Elysian Park, the country's anniversary is celebrated by people who are 
close to the Chilean Consulate, while in the Ukrainian Center it is celebrated 
by the most ardent opponents of the current military government. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no secret to anyone that the Chileans in Los Angeles have been divided 
by the politics of recent years," Ricardo Flores, a prominent member of the 
community, acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
"But not all attitudes nor actions of the Chilean colony have been marked by 
that division," noted Flores, an ex-professor who came to the United States in 
1967 and has become the Chilean gastronomic ambassador in Los Angeles as the 
owner of the Rincon Chileno restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, Flores cites the reaction to the earthquake that struck 
Santiago, the capital of Chile, on March 3, 1985: "The colony left aside its 
differences and faced the tragedy as one." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Chilean residents of Los Angeles pulled together in a similar 
display of solidarity when the U.S. goverment temporarily imposed an embargo on 
the importation of fruit from Chile last March, after two grapes containing 
cyanide were found in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt us all a lot. There were no differences because of . . . politics" 
said Jose Altamirano, president of the Club Chile-America in Orange County. 
"The reaction of U.S. authorities was a little exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to determine the precise number of Chileans in Southern 
California, and estimates vary from 12,000 to 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
The major residential concentration is in the San Fernando Valley. Another 
pocket of Chileans is in Orange County, where "there are 3,000 of us," said 
Fernando Velo, director of the Azteca weekly, which circulates in that area. 
</P>
<P>
The Chilean community in Southern California has charted a long local history, 
even though its population is relatively small. In fact, Chilean cuecas were 
danced and sung in this part of the country long before other immigrants from 
Central or South America or the Caribbean arrived here. 
</P>
<P>
During the Gold Rush from 1848 to 1852, more than 15,000 Chilean gold diggers 
arrived in Northern California. They had great success, founding towns and 
introducing new methods for gold mining. 
</P>
<P>
A small group of the immigrants remained in California and the majority 
returned to Chile when they grew tired of confronting the Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
The Chilean influence was greater in Northern California than in the southern 
region. The census of 1850 counted only four Chileans in Los Angeles County, 
five in 1852 and 35 in 1860, although, according to historian David Valjalo, 
the first pharmacy in Los Angeles was founded by a Chilean named Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
The first significant wave of Chileans in this century came in the 1950s and 
'60s. Those who arrived in those years came in search of the American way of 
life, as idealized by Hollywood movies. 
</P>
<P>
"The flow was relatively light, there were few of us here in Los Angeles," 
recalls Hugo Fraga, an elder member of the colony and director of the Refugio 
de Cristo charity organization, who reports that the majority settled in the 
Hollywood area. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the 1970s, two events provoked Chilean emigration to other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, an election brought to the presidency Salvador Allende, the candidate 
of Popular Unity, a leftist coalition that included the Socialist and Communist 
parties. Allende's rise to power caused one wave of emigration. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 11, 1973, the armed forces led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet toppled the 
constitutional government of Allende in a bloody coup. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the coup, a ship left Los Angeles for Chile in 1974, taking home 
250 people. But the establishment of the dictatorship also created a Chilean 
Diaspora that spread to all parts of the world. In the United States, political 
refuge was offered to 400 families, some of whom settled here in California. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the 1980s, at university campuses of Southern California, a 
variety of symposiums of Chilean poets in exile were held along with 
political-cultural functions called penas de solidaridad. 
</P>
<P>
"These activities, such as the instruction of Spanish and the history and 
geography of Chile for the children of the refugees have been sponsored by the 
political sectors that have maintained a position of struggle against the 
dictatorship," said Roberto Naduris, a journalist for KPFK Radio and a member 
of the exile organization called Chile Democratico. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite side to Chile Democratico there developed clubs where former 
members of the armed forces gather. In Southern California there are two: One 
Hundred Eagles, made up of former officers of the army and air force, and 
Calehuche, which unites former officers of the navy. 
</P>
<P>
But the split in the community may soon end. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, 1988, a plebiscite took place that denied the continuation of the 
rule of Pinochet and established that elections will be held in December of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the 1990 independence celebrations, which are held each Sept. 
18 in Chile, will take place at a single site in which the Chileans will 
organize their traditional fonda, dress in their huasos, eat empanadas, drink 
their wine and dance the cueca.

Many lonely, isolated Latina girls need emotional and social support. They live 
with their parents or in foster homes -- and Big Sisters of Los Angeles is 
trying to help them. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has opened a branch office to better serve Latino families, with 
help from a grant from the Irvine Foundation. The City Terrace-based office is 
seeking Latina volunteers to help girls aged 6 to 16 all over Los Angeles 
County build their self-esteem and enjoy positive new experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Women 21 or older who can be a special friend to a young Latina may volunteer 
by calling Big Sisters at (213) 268-1041 or 933-5749. A Big Sister must commit 
three to five hours a week to her Little Sister for at least one year.

THESE DAYS, MAIDS AREN'T SO DOMESTIC

<TEXT>
<P>
During the seven years that Nadir Soares worked as a maid in the home of a 
large family, she started every day before dawn and often ended after 9 p.m. 
"The next day, get up again, the same thing," Soares, 42, recalled recently. 
</P>
<P>
She made about $45 a month, less than Brazil's minimum monthly wage of $57. One 
Saturday each month was her only day off. At the end of March, Soares fell ill 
with high blood pressure and anemia and, after missing several weeks of work, 
she was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Soares, a thin woman with an air of patient resignation, told her story as she 
waited to talk with a lawyer about what she could claim as compensation from 
her former employer. Other women, all maids, also waited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Vacation Time 
</P>
<P>
Zilda da Silva, 36, wanted to ask the lawyer if she could demand pay for 
vacation time she never received during the six years she worked for a family. 
Maria Cecilia Teixeira, 37, wanted the extra pay she said she was promised for 
working from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. without a day off for three months. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, Rosane Lima Franco, said about 60 maids come to her each week with 
questions about their legal rights. She said she helps file an average of 40 
official demands a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Domestic employees are unprotected, unfairly treated and alienated by the 
whole society," Franco said. 
</P>
<P>
That is true not only in Brazil but also in most other Latin American 
countries, where "domestic employees," or maids, are a huge female underclass, 
numbering in the tens of millions. In some countries, most are Indians or 
blacks -- victims of discrimination not only because of their social class and 
sex but also because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Miserable Wages 
</P>
<P>
But Latin American domestics are increasingly less willing to accept 
exploitation and miserable wages with docile resignation. Around the region, 
there are stirrings of discontent in the quarters behind the kitchen as more 
domestic employees organize to defend their rights and demand their due. 
</P>
<P>
More than just a campaign for labor rights, this growing movement also tackles 
the injustices of a class structure that has been part of Latin American social 
fabric for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Franco works with Rio's Professional Assn. of Domestic Workers, an 
organization that has been struggling since 1960 to improve conditions for 
maids and other household employees. By most accounts, the struggle made little 
headway until the national Congress began drafting a new Brazilian constitution 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Rio association and similar groups from other cities began a lobbying 
effort that captured congressional attention. Five times between March, 1987, 
and September, 1988, maids gathered at the modernistic congressional building 
in Brasilia to demand that the constitution include basic labor rights for 
domestic employees. 
</P>
<P>
When the new constitution was promulgated in October, it included such 
guarantees for maids as monthly pay of at least the legal minimum salary, 30 
days' paid vacation a year, a full day off each week, at least 30 days' notice 
before dismissal, four months' paid maternity leave and the right to organize 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
The success has put wind in the sails of a maids' movement that, for the first 
time in Brazil, is organizing on a national level. In January, a convention of 
nearly 40 local organizations formed a National Council of Domestic Workers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main goals of the council is to help organize unions that will 
defend maids' rights and become active in the national labor movement. So far, 
a dozen domestic workers' unions have been formed. 
</P>
<P>
The maids' movement continues to lobby the Congress for other laws that will 
give domestic employees such gains as an eight-hour workday and premium pay for 
overtime. The movement's main ally in Congress is Benedita da Silva, a member 
of the Chamber of Deputies who once was a maid herself. 
</P>
<P>
Da Silva gives the Brazilian maids' movement full credit for its "conquests" in 
the new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"They fought, they struggled for that," she said. "They conquered those rights 
because they are women who are organizing and are working." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of their unprecedented momentum, maids have become news. At the 
headquarters of the Rio association, a large bulletin board is filled with 
clippings of newspaper articles about the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"When was the press ever interested in domestic employees? That is new," said 
Odette Azevedo Soares, a social worker and long-time adviser to the 
association. She said publicity has helped raise awareness among the workers 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They are starting to become aware that they have rights," she declared. "It is 
an arousing, an awakening to a new reality." 
</P>
<P>
In less than a year, the number of domestics who come to the Rio association 
for legal advice has increased from 10 or 12 a week to an average of 60. 
Associations in other Brazilian cities have experienced similar surges. The 
maids' association in Recife, in Brazil's impoverished northeast, has increased 
the office hours of its legal adviser from four to 15 a week since October. 
</P>
<P>
Nila Cordeiro dos Santos, president of the Recife association and chairman of 
the national council, said the new constitutional guarantees have pumped life 
into the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Since October, after the new constitution, it began to grow a lot because the 
employees began to believe that change is possible," Dos Santos said. "Before, 
they didn't believe anything." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the movement's membership includes only a small fraction of the more 
than 3 million Brazilians who are registered as domestic employees. And leaders 
of the movement say the number of unregistered maids may be nearly twice as 
large. 
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, as in the rest of Latin America, more women are employed as 
domestics than in any other occupation. A study by the U.N. Economic Commission 
for Latin America estimated that at least 20% of the region's paid female 
workers are domestic employees. 
</P>
<P>
In most countries, a maid's pay is no more than $30 to $50 a month, according 
to the 1988 book "Muchachas No More: Household Workers in Latin America and the 
Caribbean." Muchachas means "girls" in Spanish, a patronizing term for maids. 
</P>
<P>
"Domestic workers are searching for unity and are communicating among 
themselves; they are attempting to integrate their struggle with other sectors 
of the working class while retaining their relative autonomy," wrote the book's 
editors, Elsa M. Chaney and Mary Garcia Castro. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign of new unity, leaders of maids' organizations from 11 countries met 
last year in Bogota, Colombia, and founded the Confederation of Household 
Workers of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Aida Moreno, a Chilean who is the confederation's secretary general, said the 
organization's main work so far has been to establish contact among maids' 
groups in different countries and encourage them to organize. She said groups 
in some countries, including Paraguay and Guatemala, have begun to form only 
recently as authoritarian governments have given way to more democratic 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
In many countries, Moreno said, existing domestics' groups are church-sponsored 
and oriented toward spiritual reflection -- but such groups are becoming more 
militant. 
</P>
<P>
"Today they are taking another line, making demands," Moreno said. "The people 
are seeking to better their condition." 
</P>
<P>
The domestic servant has been at the bottom of Latin America's socioeconomic 
scale since colonial times, when slaves and Indians did household work for the 
Spanish and Portuguese ruling class. What had been a respectable, temporary 
occupation for young people in much of Europe became a dead-end job for 
exploited Latin American women. 
</P>
<P>
Just as colonial rulers once relied on Indian labor and slavery in the 
household, the region's post-colonial middle classes rely on the institution of 
the domestic employee. 
</P>
<P>
"It has its origins in slavery," said Celma Vieira, a Brazilian historian and 
social researcher. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-class apartments in Rio and other Latin cities have tiny maids' quarters 
beside the utility area behind the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have a window, they don't have breathing space," Vieira said. "The 
living conditions are degrading." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their long working day, beginning before breakfast and ending after 
dinner, maids have little opportunity for study or courtship. Sometimes, Vieira 
said, the domestic employee is sexually exploited by male members of the 
household where she works. 
</P>
<P>
Some feminists have taken up the cause of the maid, but in many cases 
"liberated" Latin American women depend on low-paid domestics for their own 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"For the woman to be liberated, to be a career woman, she has to oppress 
another woman who stays at home and does that work," Vieira said. 
</P>
<P>
Many maids must neglect their own children to care for those of their 
employers, said Nair Jane de Castro Lima, president of the Rio association. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why there are so many children on the street," Lima said. "The 
majority are the children of domestic employees." 
</P>
<P>
Lima and other critics of Latin American social conditions blame the plight of 
maids on class structures that keep a majority of the people poor. She said the 
"bosses" of society must come to understand that only by raising the majority's 
standard of living will a country like Brazil progress. 
</P>
<P>
But that would mean giving up cheap household help, she noted, adding: "The 
laws are made by the bosses, and they are not going to want to give up that 
perquisite." 
</P>
<P>
Some Brazilian "bosses" have started a movement to oppose the maids. In 
January, lawyer Margareth Galvao Carbinato founded the Union of Domestic 
Employers in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Carbinato said that since the inclusion of new rights 
in the constitution, homemakers have been "driven to desperation" by an "excess 
of demands" from domestics. 
</P>
<P>
Carbinato, 35, said the new employers' union has begun a blacklist of "bad 
domestic employees" accused of stealing or making "abusive" demands. It also 
has prepared documents useful to employers, including standard labor contracts, 
work rules and warning slips "to show how far the rights of employees go and 
where the rights of employers begin."

House Democrats, moving to rebuild a party leadership devastated by ethics 
controversies, Wednesday elected former presidential candidate Richard A. 
Gephardt of Missouri to be their new majority leader and chose the 
highest-ranking black in Congress, William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, to the 
No. 3 post of Democratic whip. 
</P>
<P>
Following their victories in lopsided ballots, both congressmen pledged to work 
with new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley to restore a sense of party purpose and 
unity that was strained during the months-long investigations of top Democratic 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to move this House away from partisan wrangling, rancor and 
bitterness and reassert an agenda for progress," Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
The move of Gephardt and Gray into top leadership posts is expected to soothe 
somewhat the interparty tensions inflamed by the announced resignations of 
former House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and whip Tony Coelho of Merced, both 
of whom had been embroiled in ethics controversies. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt and Gray, as well as Foley, have reputations as conciliators able to 
bridge differences between opposing viewpoints and make back-room legislative 
deals. None are regarded as partisan infighters, as Wright and Coelho were. 
</P>
<P>
Even House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, whose formal complaint 
about Wright's financial affairs led to the Speaker's downfall, had kind words 
for the new Democratic triumvirate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a team of Foley, Gephardt and Gray is a very competent, articulate and 
energetic team," Gingrich told reporters. "It's a first-class team." 
</P>
<P>
Most Democrats, even some who backed losing candidates in the election by the 
House Democratic Caucus, appeared happy with the outcome of the contests for 
the No. 2 and No. 3 party positions. They voiced hope that the new team would 
refocus the House's attention from internal and ethical problems to legislative 
business. 
</P>
<P>
As veteran Rep. William D. Ford (D-Mich.) put it: "The new Democratic 
leadership now has the right stuff to end the divisiveness we've been through 
for the past several months. We're ready to go to work to provide solutions to 
this country's needs." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt, opposed by Rep. Ed Jenkins of Georgia, won by the overwhelming margin 
of 181 to 76. The Missouri congressman pledged in advance that he would not 
seek the Democratic nomination for President in 1992 if he became the majority 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt, who ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 presidential nomination, entered 
the race for the second-ranking Democratic leadership position only after 
Coelho, who was a candidate for the job, shocked his colleagues by announcing 
he would resign from the House in the wake of mounting questions about his 
$100,000 investment in a junk bond. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, who said he ran partly as a reminder that one-third of House Democrats 
were in the conservative wing with him, said Gephardt is probably the single 
most popular member of the House. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relief that he has no (ethical) problems," said Rep. Dan Glickman 
(D-Kan.), commenting on Gephardt's unsmirched reputation despite the intense 
scrutiny he received during the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wins on First Ballot 
</P>
<P>
Gray, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, moved up to the whip position by 
a first-ballot victory over two opponents, Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan and 
Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr. of Arkansas. The tally was 134 for Gray, 97 for Bonior 
and 30 for Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Philadelphia Democrat were concerned that his candidacy might 
suffer because of a controversy over a recent Justice Department leak 
concerning an FBI investigation of his office. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, 
however, issued a statement asserting that Gray was not the target of the 
inquiry, which reportedly involves allegations of a no-show employee on a House 
committee staff. Thornburgh said Gray had cooperated fully with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"The caucus has spoken," said Gray, buoyed by his showing despite the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In a move to heal any wounds caused by the election bids, Foley announced, 
after consulting with Gephardt and Gray, that he would retain Bonior in the 
post of chief deputy whip for the rest of this congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
Bonior, while obviously disappointed by the outcome, congratulated Gray by 
saying: "You are a classy, energetic, intelligent, helluva guy." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt also told reporters that he expected that Southerners, now 
unrepresented in the top leadership, would be included in such bodies as the 
Democratic steering and policy committee where the Speaker has the power to 
appoint 12 of its 20 members. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's victory will create a vacancy in the caucus chairman's post that will be 
filled shortly. Two candidates -- caucus vice chairman Steny H. Hoyer of 
Maryland and Barbara B. Kennelly of Connecticut -- already have announced they 
will seek the fourth-ranking party post. 
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech, Gephardt said he realized there was work to be done 
in rebuilding House Democrats' spirits and cohesiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"These past weeks have been difficult days. . . , " he said. "Many of you are 
discouraged by the rancor and bitterness. Many are skeptical about our ability 
to accomplish anything because of the thicket of differences on important 
issues among ourselves and between us and the Republicans." But he said he and 
the other leaders were confident the problems will be overcome.

The Soviet Union, after decades of costly pursuit of superpower status, took a 
significant step this week toward reintegrating itself politically,

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pledging with West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl that their countries would work together to develop "a peaceful 
European order," made clear Moscow's preference for a place in the "common 
European home," as he put it, over the role of a superpower with global 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the continent has been divided for decades, the awareness of Europe's 
identity and common assets has endured and is becoming ever stronger," the two 
leaders said in a joint declaration. "This development must be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany consider it a paramount 
objective of their policies to continue Europe's historical traditions and thus 
contribute towards overcoming the division of Europe. They are resolved to work 
together in the search to develop a Europe of peace and cooperation -- a 
peaceful European order, a common European home. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union hopes that such efforts will end its long isolation from the 
political coalescence and the economic development that have brought Western 
Europe such stability and prosperity and now threatens to leave Moscow and its 
allies in Eastern Europe behind completely as the European Community moves to 
establish a unified market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev realized -- and it took much insight and integrity to do so -- that 
the Soviet Union had lost in the arms race to the United States, was losing in 
the economic race to Japan and the European Community and would become a third- 
or fourth-rank power in 20 or 30 years," a senior European ambassador said in 
Moscow recently. "The Russian fear is that they will be thought of as Asians, 
irrelevant to Europe, and just forgotten as we move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev's best bet, politically and economically, was to return to Europe if 
the Soviet Union has any chance of keeping up. But that means ending the old 
thinking of 'We are bigger and stronger than you' or 'We have a better system 
than you,' and it means more than slogans about peace, friendship and 
cooperation. If the Russians want a place in Europe, they will have to earn 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In West Germany, however, Gorbachev found a partner willing -- more than 
Britain and France so far have been -- to respond to Soviet needs and accept 
Moscow's desire to participate in shaping the Europe of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'division of Europe' has a special meaning here," a senior West German 
official remarked Wednesday, "and while Kohl understands something different 
from what Gorbachev means when he says it, there is enough common ground for us 
to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
A political commentator put it more tartly on West German television Wednesday: 
"Mikhail Gorbachev was looking for a solid boulder to be his anchor while he 
winched the Soviet Union into political and economic modernity, and Helmut Kohl 
said the Federal Republic of Germany would be that boulder." 
</P>
<P>
In return, the Soviet Union has already begun to soften its opposition -- 
adamant and often angry in the past -- to the possible reunification of East 
and West Germany. Talking with journalists after signing the joint statement, 
Gorbachev said of that issue, "Let time decide." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the world is changing, and changing for the better," the Soviet 
leader said, "and it is opening possibilities for better contacts between all 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are wise and far-sighted, then a good number of profound changes can 
take place in Europe and in the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
In October, Gorbachev had bluntly told Kohl in Moscow that even talking about 
reunification was dangerous, for it threatened Europe's postwar stability. 
</P>
<P>
And one Soviet specialist on Europe, Vladislav Belov, went as far last week as 
to suggest that he could see growing cooperation between socialist East Germany 
and capitalist West Germany leading to a decision by them -- as "two 
independent and sovereign states" -- on some sort of reunification. 
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Wall, Belov added, would then be little more than a museum piece if 
it still existed. 
</P>
<P>
"As a symbol, I believe the Wall will be destroyed sometime," he told a 
briefing at the Foreign Ministry in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
On this trip, Gorbachev emphasized that, in signing what has already become 
known as the "Bonn Declaration," "we are drawing a line on the postwar period . 
. . (and taking) a decisive step in the direction of one another." 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviet Union, the joint statement signed by Gorbachev and Kohl does 
mark a substantial change in the way it views the world -- and itself. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the fundamental shifts in Soviet strategy under Gorbachev, the 
decision reflects a harsh appraisal by the Soviet leadership of the country's 
problems and capabilities, according to senior Gorbachev advisers. 
</P>
<P>
"We inherited an empire and made it even grander, but we cannot afford it or 
even run it," one top Soviet foreign policy specialist said here, explaining 
the reorientation of his country's strategy. "Today, our people realize that, 
until we build our own country and make it strong within, anything we do abroad 
will be little more than an adventure. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But, if we are not to be a superpower, then what are we? First of all, we are 
a European country -- not a small one, perhaps even a great one, but definitely 
a European nation. So, let us find our place in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow, which until a year ago refused to recognize the European Community, 
although its 12 members were reshaping the continent, accepts now that its 
future in Europe requires active cooperation with the community and with the 
larger Council of Europe, which it had also long disdained. 
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts pledged by Gorbachev to elaborate with Kohl and other 
European leaders new concepts of cooperation will give a Soviet foreign policy 
a different and, in some ways, a tighter focus so that European concerns become 
far more prominent. 
</P>
<P>
"These are relations between great powers," Vitaly V. Zhurkin, director of the 
Soviet Institute of Europe, said in appraising the Soviet-West German summit -- 
diminishing the Soviet Union as he elevated West Germany a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow realizes, of course, that its international responsibility will 
continue, senior Soviet foreign policy specialists say. Soviet military power 
remains second only to that of the United States, and arms reduction agreements 
will require time to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is also a major Asian nation, facing Japan and bordering on 
China, and these interests must be balanced with the new emphasis on Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have a European focus and an Asian focus and a special relationship 
with the United States," a Soviet political commentator with the Gorbachev 
delegation remarked, "but the chronic overreaching of the past has ended." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow is hoping, however, that a significant improvement in relations with the 
West as a whole will follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with West Germany will go a long way toward shaping Europe for 
the rest of this century and well into the next," Georgy A. Arbatov, director 
of the Soviet Institute for Study of the U.S.A. and Canada, said here. "This 
will also have a substantial impact, we believe, on Soviet-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We should recall that when something happens in our relations with West 
Germany, it signifies a turn for the better, as happened with our peace treaty 
in 1970, or for the worse. There is a strong movement for global changes that 
are ripe, or even overdue, and this development should help them." 
</P>
<P>
Changes in domestic policies are also implicit as the Soviet Union seeks to 
re-establish itself as a European country and no longer emphasizes the 
socialist character of its political and economic system. 
</P>
<P>
After dismissing the democracies of Western Europe as "bourgeois" or even 
political shams for many years, the Soviet Union has committed itself to a 
political order in the Bonn Declaration that enshrines their most basic ideals. 
</P>
<P>
With its own economic system evolving away from central planning toward "market 
socialism," the Soviet Union is actively seeking assistance from West Germany 
and other capitalist countries not just to develop its backward economy but to 
train market-oriented managers to run it. 
</P>
<P>
"The future is economic integration, not isolation," an economist in the Soviet 
delegation said. "We thought central planning could do it all, and we were 
wrong. We thought that by relying on our own resources we could grow faster and 
become stronger, and we were wrong. And, quite foolishly, we thought we should 
protect our 'socialist purity' from contamination by the market." 
</P>
<P>
Although Soviet ideologists had long claimed that socialism had created a "new 
Soviet man" and a "new Soviet culture," both superior to anything in the West, 
the country will now be seeking to re-establish what was European in its 
traditions as a basis of ensuring the country's reintegration into Europe.

CHINA ORDERS 2 U.S. REPORTERS OUT OF COUNTRY

In action that further escalates tension between Washington and Beijing on 
issues of human rights and national sovereignty, China issued expulsion orders 
Wednesday for two U.S. correspondents on charges that they violated martial-law 
restrictions on press coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Alan W. Pessin, Beijing bureau chief of the U.S. government-funded Voice of 
America, and Associated Press reporter John Pomfret were summoned to a Beijing 
city office in the afternoon and told they must leave China within 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The action came after several days of blistering attacks in the Chinese media 
against Voice of America, which broadcasts to a huge Chinese audience in both 
English and Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, China's ambassador, Han Xu, was summoned to the State Department 
to receive a "vigorous" protest of the expulsions. However, State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Bush Administration had no plans to 
retaliate against any of the 38 Chinese journalists working in the United 
States. She said a similar protest would be delivered by the U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing to the Chinese Foreign Ministry this morning. 
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that both Pomfret and Pessin were fully accredited 
correspondents with Chinese visas authorizing them to work in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of two U.S. reporters as expulsion targets seemed tied to Chinese 
anger at Washington for granting refuge in the U.S. Embassy to astrophysicist 
Fang Lizhi, China's most prominent pro-democracy activist, and his wife, Li 
Shuxian, a Beijing University physics professor. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a bloody June 3-4 crackdown on student-led pro-democracy 
protests, the Chinese government has issued arrest warrants for Fang and Li, 
and bitterly condemned the U.S. action as interference in China's internal 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baker Called 'Confident' 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official in Washington was quoted as saying Wednesday 
that Secretary of State James A. Baker III believes "there are reasons to be 
hopeful" that the United States and China can reach an agreement permitting 
Fang and his wife to leave the embassy without risking arrest. The official, 
who spoke to news agency correspondents on the understanding he would not be 
identified by name, did not list the reasons. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, if necessary, the embassy is prepared to shelter Fang and his 
wife for an extended period. "We went into it with our eyes open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since declaring martial law in Beijing on May 20, Chinese authorities have 
issued a variety of press restrictions intended to limit coverage of the 
violent suppression of a pro-democracy student movement that began in 
mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions were widely ignored, however, when the Chinese army swept into 
central Beijing late on June 3 and early June 4, shooting into crowds of 
citizens seeking to block its way. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, died in the assault. The Chinese Red Cross 
initially estimated the death toll at 2,600, a figure that is still given 
considerable credibility in diplomatic circles. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after the incident, a top government spokesman asserted that only 
about 300 people had died. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Chinese authorities further reduced the official death figure to 
around 200. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency carried a news release from the "Propaganda 
Department" of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party 
that gave a detailed account of widespread destruction of army vehicles and 
said that nearly 100 soldiers and policemen were killed by 
"counterrevolutionary" rioters. "Some 100 civilians" also died, the report 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The expulsions of Pessin and Pomfret came against this background. 
</P>
<P>
Pessin, 33, was accused of "conducting illegal press coverage after martial law 
was declared" and "writing news stories to distort facts, spread rumor and 
incite and stir up turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion," the New China 
News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Pessin told reporters in Beijing that he had responded to his accusers with 
this statement: "We report the best, most accurate, the fairest and the 
best-balanced news that we possibly can. The only motive that we have is to 
tell the truth as best we can. Governments do not always like that. To say that 
Voice of America is maliciously creating rumors and has ulterior motives is 
itself a malicious rumor, apparently with ulterior motives." 
</P>
<P>
VOA Director Richard Carlson told reporters that the expulsions were "a step 
backward for the media in China, which over the past couple of years have 
demonstrated some steps forward." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We think it's very unfortunate and sad, in fact, for the Chinese 
people, who in the tens of millions depend on the Voice of America and the BBC 
and some other outside broadcasters for what has been extremely reliable, 
straightforward, factual, unbiased accounts" of the turmoil in their country. 
</P>
<P>
Pomfret, 30, was accused of "having frequent contacts with illegal organization 
leaders, passing on information to and providing shelter for them" and 
"obtaining state secrets through illegal means," the New China News Agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pomfret said he also was accused of giving protection to Wuer Kaixi, a key 
leader of the seven-week-long pro-democracy student protests. Chinese 
authorities have charged Wuer with counterrevolutionary activities and issued a 
warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Pomfret, who speaks fluent Chinese, wrote a profile of Wuer before the 
martial-law crackdown and interviewed him several times during the 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"I did my job as a journalist and I worked hard," Pomfret said. "It's a shame 
that these are the results I get." 
</P>
<P>
Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of the Associated Press, said 
in New York: "We deplore and have protested in the strongest terms to the 
Chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and factual reporting." 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: "We believe these 
journalists were trying to print the truth of the situation in China. Actions 
such as this, the harassment of journalists trying to do their jobs and 
attempts to jam VOA broadcasts, will not succeed in keeping the truth about 
what is going on in China from being heard in that troubled land or throughout 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Vernon Mann, a reporter for London-based Independent Television News, was 
restricted to his hotel Wednesday in the central city of Chengdu after being 
detained Tuesday for recording scenes of burned out buildings and buses, an ITN 
spokesman said. "His passport and papers have been confiscated and he has been 
ordered to stay in his hotel and 'await punishment,' " the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in Shanghai, another reporter for ITN was expelled from China for 
covering demonstrations in Shanghai while on a tourist visa. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing on Wednesday, soldiers detained Denis Hiault, Beijing bureau chief 
of Agence-France Press, for an hour and confiscated his residence card. Hiault 
was accused of photographing troops. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese media, meanwhile, reverted further Wednesday to the use of harsh 
jargon reminiscent of Mao Tse-tung's chaotic 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
A front-page commentary in the official Communist Party newspaper, the People's 
Daily, said that the recent disturbances show that "in our country, class 
struggle still exists within certain limits -- a small number of reactionary 
elements who hate the Communist Party and hate the socialist system have never 
given up their political goals." 
</P>
<P>
Another People's Daily commentary, also published on the front page, sharply 
attacked Fang, his wife and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people overseas who are hostile to China have tried hard to flatter such 
people and label them 'democratic fighters,' " the commentary said. "Their aim 
. . . is . . . to plunge China into chaos, to eliminate rule by the Communist 
Party and to overthrow China's socialist system. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that "some people in the United States always hate 
communism. They try hard to find ways to use their bourgeois ideology and 
bourgeois political system to influence some Chinese people, with the goal of 
establishing a bourgeois republic in China. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the American side . . . will stop its interference in China's 
internal affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Beijing's relations with other industrial democracies have also suffered sharp 
deterioration as a result of the June 3-4 carnage. 
</P>
<P>
Tension is building between China and Australia in the wake of press reports 
that an unidentified Chinese dissident has been granted refuge in the 
Australian Embassy in Beijing. An Australian Embassy spokesman declined to make 
a substantive comment on the reports, but added: "Were the situation to arise, 
we would handle it with the utmost sensitivity. Were such a case to arise, it 
would be considered on its merits." 
</P>
<P>
The recent violence and ideological rigidity in Beijing have also severely 
damaged public confidence in the British colony of Hong Kong, scheduled to 
revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
David Wilson, the British-appointed governor of Hong Kong, dispatched two 
personal representatives to London on Wednesday to try to persuade Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher's administration to promise ethnic Chinese born in 
Hong Kong -- who number about 3.25 million out of the colony's total population 
of 5.5 million -- the right to move to Britain before 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visa Sections Reopen 
</P>
<P>
The United States on Wednesday reopened the visa-issuing sections of its 
Beijing embassy and its consulates in other parts of China, which had been 
closed for several days. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department spokesman announced Tuesday that it will begin granting 
larger numbers of visas to Chinese citizens for temporary visits to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
In both Beijing and Shanghai, fairly typical crowds of about 200 people 
gathered in the morning hoping to submit visa applications. Most were students 
who had received acceptances from American universities and obtained Chinese 
passports before the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants appeared unwilling to discuss politics. 
</P>
<P>
"All I really care about is studying and getting exposure to the latest 
technology," said Cai Baoxuan, 30, a pharmacist who wants to study at the 
University of Hawaii. "I don't know anything about politics." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Karl Schoenberger, in Shanghai, and Norman Kempster, in 
Washington, contributed to this article.

Two suspected members of the IRA have been indicted for attempted murder in two 
bombing attacks against British military bases in West Germany that wounded 46 
people, Kurt Rebmann, West Germany's chief federal prosecutor, said in 
Frankfurt. Terence Gerard McGeough and Gerard Thomas Hanratty, both 30 and both 
born in Northern Ireland, have been in prison since they were arrested, heavily 
armed, near the Dutch border last August. Rebmann said that the two also are 
charged with "other crimes" not specified. The IRA, fighting to end British 
rule in Northern Ireland, said it had intended to "inflict a devastating blow" 
on British North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces stationed in West Germany.

Chile's ruling junta approved constitutional reforms negotiated with the 
opposition that will lessen the role of the armed forces when a civilian 
government takes office next year after 16 years of military rule. President 
Augusto Pinochet, leader of a 1973 coup, is expected today to formally call for 
a referendum in July or August to approve the reforms. The amendments to the 
1980 constitution, which was written by the military government, lessen the 
role of the armed forces in the civilian government that will assume office in 
March, 1990. Meantime, toying with the idea of another term, Pinochet said he 
might run in the December elections, "if the people want me to."

A House Ways and Means subcommittee voted to increase the amount that Social 
Security recipients may earn without losing part of their benefits. The 
proposal was added to a package of amendments that includes a provision 
removing the Social Security Administration from the Department of Health and 
Human Services. The administration would be directed by a three-member board 
appointed by the President and run by an executive director named by the board. 
Currently, a person age 65 through 69 may earn up to $8,880 without losing a 
part of the Social Security pension. Under the subcommittee's bill, the 
limitation for those between 65 and 69 would increase next year to about $9,720 
and the following year to about $10,440.

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has endorsed a proposal to erect a 
Chinatown replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue, toppled by tanks during 
the bloody confrontation in Beijing's Tian An Men Square. A coalition of 
Chinese groups in the San Francisco Bay Area is seeking to raise up to $250,000 
to build the 30-foot sculpture, which still requires approval by the Parks and 
Recreation Commission and the Arts Commission. "It would be temporary," said 
Thomas Marsh, a sculptor promoting the project. "It would be given to the 
Chinese when they're ready to accept it."

Riot police in Managua fired tear gas at 1,000 striking taxi drivers protesting 
government measures that have more than doubled the price of gasoline. Taxi 
drivers, who own their cabs, stopped work Tuesday after gasoline prices rose by 
110% after a 52.5% devaluation of Nicaragua's currency. In addition to a return 
to the old price for gasoline, the drivers also want discounts on tires and 
spare parts and suppression of unofficial "pirate taxis." The austerity 
measures by the leftist Sandinista government are aimed at combatting 
inflation, which was 15.5% last month. The cost of living rose 20,000% last 
year.

A wildcat strike by an estimated 10,000 West Virginia coal miners spread into 
Virginia as the United Mine Workers members ignored a federal judge's 
back-to-work orders, officials said. State police reported minor violence at 
mines in Raleigh County in West Virginia but no arrests as roving bands of 
pickets continued to shut down mines. About 650 Westmoreland Coal Co. employees 
at three mines in Virginia joined the walkout that began Monday. It was the 
first major expansion of the miners' show of support for 1,600 union members 
striking against the Pittston Coal Group.

Testimony ended in the perjury trial of former Rep. Pat Swindall -- without the 
former GOP congressman taking the witness stand. The defense rested on the 17th 
day of the trial in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, and prosecutors called only 
one rebuttal witness. Attorneys planned to make legal arguments to the judge 
today, and the jury was told to return Friday for closing statements. The 
former Georgia congressman is accused of nine counts of perjury for lying to a 
federal grand jury regarding his 1987 dealings with an undercover agent posing 
as a money launderer, and with an associate who was convicted of money 
laundering.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration unveiled a revised shuttle 
launch schedule, formally pushing the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope into 
1990 and cutting the 1989 flight schedule by one mission. As expected, the new 
shuttle schedule lists six flights in 1989, nine flights in 1990, eight in 
1991, 12 in 1992, including the first flight of the new shuttle Endeavour, and 
14 in 1993.

PARTICIPATION IN STATE'S NEW WORKFARE PROGRAM LAGS 
</P>

Fewer welfare recipients than expected are participating in the state's new 
workfare program, in part because many of them already are working part time in 
an effort to become self-supporting, according to a study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Only 34% of the welfare recipients who registered for workfare during the 
six-month study period actually participated in any of the education, training 
or work elements of the program, according to the study conducted for the state 
by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Gueron, president of the New York-based research firm, concluded that 
state officials should expect that at best only about 50% of eligible welfare 
recipients will end up taking part in the workfare program, known formally as 
Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN). 
</P>
<P>
"It will be important to have realistic expectations," Gueron said. "Because 
people leave welfare all the time, get part-time jobs, or meet other program 
criteria, not all welfare recipients targeted by these programs will 
participate in them." 
</P>
<P>
Under state and federal law, welfare recipients are permitted to work while 
receiving public assistance and their welfare checks are partially reduced, 
depending on how much they earn. A welfare recipient who works at least 15 
hours a week is not required to participate in GAIN. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 26% of all the aid recipients in the study were exempted from workfare 
because they had part-time jobs. Another 18% left the welfare rolls before they 
ever took part in GAIN, while 22% never got involved in the program for reasons 
county officials could not explain. 
</P>
<P>
State officials initially had hoped that well over 50% of those eligible would 
participate in GAIN. 
</P>
<P>
Gueron cautioned that the study is based on early efforts to implement the 
program in eight counties that were among the first to start, including 
Ventura, Fresno, Kern, Napa and Santa Clara. The study focused on welfare 
recipients assigned to the program from December, 1986, to June, 1987. Their 
progress was then tracked through 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The study, the most detailed analysis to date of the GAIN program, takes on 
added importance because a new federal law will require all states to undertake 
similar programs designed to give welfare recipients education and put them to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
California's program, the most complex in the nation, was approved in 1985 as a 
result of a bipartisan compromise. Under GAIN, able-bodied welfare recipients 
with children over the age of 6 will lose their grants unless they choose from 
an array of educational, training and work programs. 
</P>
<P>
State officials are now preparing for changes in the GAIN program wrought by 
the new federal law. Most important is a reduction in the age threshold that 
will require welfare parents with children between the ages of 3 and 5 to 
enroll in workfare. 
</P>
<P>
California's landmark workfare program was approved by the Legislature and Gov. 
George Deukmejian in 1985. All 58 counties in the state are now operating some 
form of GAIN program. 
</P>
<P>
One fundamental conclusion of the research group's report was that all of the 
first eight counties studied had been successful in gearing up for the program 
and establishing the necessary educational, job training and work programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We accomplished a lot of things people were not sure we could pull off," said 
Kathy Lewis, who oversees the GAIN program for the state Department of Social 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
The study illustrates that GAIN's record compares favorably with a 
less-sophisticated workfare program championed in the early 1970s by then-Gov. 
Ronald Reagan that fell flat on its face when counties throughout the state 
refused to implement it. 
</P>
<P>
As of February, 1989, 127,000 welfare recipients throughout California have 
signed up to participate in GAIN, Lewis said. Of these, 38,000 have gotten 
jobs, including 11,000 who have moved entirely off the welfare rolls.

CLEAN-AIR DEADLINE TIGHTENED; EDISON FEARS 'BROWNOUTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A South Coast Air Quality Management District hearing panel Wednesday modified 
a compromise reached with Southern California Edison Co. that had promised to 
end the firm's long-standing opposition to a far-reaching clean-air plan for 
the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The four-member hearing panel said the compromise was far too lenient in giving 
Edison and other electrical utilities until 1999 to meet tough new emission 
limits on nitrogen oxides. The original deadline was 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the panel called for a Dec. 31, 1996, deadline, which prompted 
warnings from Edison of possible "brownouts" caused by shutting down power 
plants in a shorter time period to install the emission controls. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed emission control rule is a key element in the district's drive to 
bring the South Coast Air Basin into compliance with federal clean-air 
standards by the year 2007. It covers emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxides 
from power plants, one of the key ingredients of photochemical smog. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goes to Full Board 
</P>
<P>
The panel's recommendation now goes to the full 12-member AQMD governing board, 
which is scheduled to take up the issue in August. 
</P>
<P>
Final approval by the full board of the tougher timetable could rekindle 
Edison's opposition to the 20-year clean-air strategy, possibly resulting in a 
protracted lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
But, while court action is "always an option," Edison environmental affairs 
manager Michael M. Hertel said Wednesday, "I'm not threatening it." Hertel said 
Wednesday's action will require additional evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how we're going to meet it (the 1996 deadline) and still meet 
reliable power supplies," Hertel said. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Larry L. Berg quickly dismissed the threat of brownouts. "I don't 
feel we have made a (recommendation) which will produce a brownout," said Berg. 
</P>
<P>
The original compromise was announced April 18 and endorsed by AQMD Executive 
Officer James M. Lents after behind-the-scenes negotiations. Both Edison and 
AQMD Deputy Executive Officer Pat Nemeth hailed it at the time, saying it 
removed a major obstacle to implementing the district's clean-air strategy for 
bringing the four-county basin into compliance with federal clean air 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
But, board member Henry W. Wedaa said Wednesday, "The board feels he (Lents) 
was too generous in his compromise with Edison." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
38% Reduction in Cost 
</P>
<P>
Edison had estimated the compromise would cut its compliance costs from $800 
million to $500 million, a 38% savings. Even with the savings, the average 
homeowner's monthly electrical would increase about 1%. 
</P>
<P>
But stepping up the deadline to 1996 could be "at least as expensive" to Edison 
as $800 million, state Public Utilities Commission policy analyst James E. 
Hendry said Wednesday. The higher cost would increase electrical bills 3% 
monthly. 
</P>
<P>
During the public debate before the clean-air plan was approved last March, 
Edison was one of its leading opponents. The plan calls for tough new air 
pollution controls on electrical utilities, petroleum refiners, consumer 
products and even life style changes that could affect how people get to and 
from work. 
</P>
<P>
The basin, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties, currently exceeds federal clean-air standards for ozone by three 
times the permitted levels. The basin also exceeds federal limits on carbon 
monoxide, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spent millions of dollars developing and lobbying for an alternative 
proposal, but publicly dropped its opposition while negotiating behind the 
scenes for some kind of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had charged the compromise resulted from illegal "back room" 
dealing and on Wednesday, they renewed their attack on its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for (nitrogen oxide) reductions is unchallengeable," said Gladys 
Meade of the American Lung Assn. of California. Meade said federal law calls 
for attaining clean air standards "as expeditiously as practicable." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the extended deadline, Edison had also agreed to a slightly 
more stringent limit on nitrogen oxide emissions. But because it would take 
longer to reach the standard, twice as much nitrogen would be pumped into the 
atmosphere in the next 10 years, Meade said. 
</P>
<P>
Hertel argued that at the end of the 10-year period, NOX emissions would be cut 
by 77% as compared to 73% under the original timetable. Hertel also said all of 
Edison's generating units would be fitted with additional air pollution 
controls to cut emissions from 35% to 90%, depending upon the type of controls 
placed on each unit. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, both Edison and the AQMD staff argued that extending the 
deadline for emission controls to 1999 would put the utility in a better 
position to replace existing units with ones that are cleaner and more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Shortening the deadlines, they cautioned, would force utilities to place 
additional pollution controls on older, inefficient units instead of replacing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
With the panel's action Wednesday, Lents was put on notice for the first time 
since assuming leadership of the district in 1986 that the governoring board, 
and not the staff, would make the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff may have agreed to something with industry, but that does not mean 
this panel or the full board has to go along. We are the policy-makers," board 
member Sabrinia Schiller told the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Lents said, "I always told them (Edison) I didn't have those guys (board 
members) in my back pocket."

EPA CHEMIST ACCUSES AGENCY OFFICIALS OF COVERING UP DRINKING WATER POLLUTION 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press

<P>
An Environmental Protection Agency chemist alleges that agency officials 
suppressed evidence of dioxin and other poisons at wood-treatment waste sites 
affecting drinking water supplies in the Oroville area and three other rural 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The federal agency also softened its regulation of wood preservers in response 
to industry lobbying and political pressure from several members of Congress, 
including Dan Quayle, then an Indiana senator and now vice president, according 
to Cate Jenkins, a chemist at the agency's headquarters who helped draft the 
new industry rules. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins has brought those and other charges of criminal violations of 
environmental laws to the attention of several committee leaders in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials denied Jenkins' charges, saying she made them based on inaccurate 
data and that a review by the U.S. inspector general's office cleared the 
agency of criminal misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not covering up anything," said Terry Wilson, a spokesman for the EPA 
regional office. "We're being successful at working with a company that, at 
times, has been reluctant. We have made a determination how to clean up the 
site, and I think that's a major accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
Details of the allegations were reported in Wednesday editions of the 
Sacramento Bee. 
</P>
<P>
In investigating drinking water contamination from the Koppers Co. 
wood-preserving plant in Oroville, Jenkins said EPA officials in San Francisco 
played down data supplied by the company showing dangerously high levels of 
pentachlorophenol, or PCP, in one family's well. PCP is an insecticide that is 
used to treat wood products. It contains dioxin as a manufacturing byproduct 
and produces dioxin when burned. 
</P>
<P>
The Koppers report on samples taken in 1983 from the well used by Norma Prince 
and her family was released in March, 1988, about a year after the EPA received 
it, Jenkins said. John Kemmerer, the EPA official in charge of the Oroville 
investigation, later declared that the data was actually from a culvert in the 
Koppers plant yard, not the Princes' yard. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins said Kemmerer changed his story one day after telling her in April, 
1988, that he was "quite definite" about the high level of PCP found in the 
family's well water. She said Kemmerer had told her the data was insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
William Morris, manager of the Oroville plant, said Kemmerer was right about 
the high PCP levels being incorrectly assigned to the Prince family well. 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokesman Wilson said Kemmerer told residents at a March, 1988, meeting 
that assigning the high reading to the Prince well was an error. Wilson said 
the EPA staff double-checked the Prince well. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't find anything, and so we determined that this must have been a 
glitch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Princes and other nearby residents were receiving bottled drinking water at 
Koppers' expense at the time, but Jenkins said residents still were bathing and 
washing clothes in the PCP-laced water. 
</P>
<P>
Koppers and the EPA have known since at least 1972 that ground water near and 
below the Koppers plant and Louisiana-Pacific sawmill next door has been 
contaminated with pentachlorophenol. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been piping clean water to some residents and has proposed 
treating and removing the polluted water and soil.

SAGON PENN ADMITS DAMAGING MOTORCYCLE; OTHER COUNT DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sagon Penn pleaded guilty Wednesday to misdemeanor vandalism and was ordered 
released from County Jail after serving 15 days after assaulting his 
ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction is a far cry from the felony attempted-murder charge under which 
Penn was originally booked by San Diego police when he was arrested May 31 at 
the ex-girlfriend's Normal Heights apartment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victim Snagged Case 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. John Witt said the reduced charge was agreed on after the victim 
declined to cooperate with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major problem in any kind of prosecution like this," Witt said in 
describing Roger Worshim's unwillingness to follow up with the case against 
Penn, 27. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go ahead with it," Witt added. "And we often do, particularly in cases 
of spousal abuse. But we felt that, under the circumstances, this was a very 
fair settlement to the people involved. We feel that we accomplished what could 
be expected." 
</P>
<P>
Penn's attorney, Nanette Monson, said the plea-bargain arrangement was in her 
client's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
"The city attorney definitely had problems with this case," she said. "Mr. 
Worshim had no intention of cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
"But the city attorney also had some independent witnesses, and it's their 
intention to prosecute all the way and never drop cases. So I think this 
arrangement worked out very well for Sagon. It worked out to his advantage." 
</P>
<P>
In two long, highly publicized trials, Penn, who is black, was twice acquitted 
of killing a white San Diego police officer and wounding another, along with a 
civilian ride-along. Since then, he has surfaced several times in 
domestic-disturbance incidents in which police have been called. 
</P>
<P>
In the May 31 incident, Penn went to Donna Parks' apartment and allegedly 
grabbed Worshim and tried to choke him. He also damaged Worshim's motorcycle, 
which was parked outside. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, police officials defended the original attempted-murder citation 
under which Penn was jailed in the current case, saying it is normal procedure 
for authorities to detain suspects on the highest possible offense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Deadly Force Involved 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said: "It's not unusual for charges to be 
reduced in our criminal justice system. I don't know the intricacies of this 
case, but the district attorney and the city attorney know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the case, the district attorney decided not to pursue felony 
charges in the matter because it did not involve a deadly weapon or cause 
serious bodily injury. The case was then referred to the city attorney's 
office, and Penn was charged with misdemeanor battery and misdemeanor 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Witt said that under the terms of the plea arrangement, the battery charge was 
dismissed in return for Penn's pleading guilty plea to vandalizing the 
motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Penn was ordered released from jail and placed on three years' probation. He 
was also ordered to undergo periodic psychiatric evaluation, a requirement 
apparently sought after two courtroom outbursts in which he rambled about his 
love for Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Linda Quinn was advised that Penn had already given Worshim 
$1,500 for the motorcycle damage. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the guilty plea means a conviction for Penn, Monson said it was the 
best course to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of reasons, it was the safer route," she said. "He was facing a 
maximum of a year and a half in jail, and he already did 15 days actual time. 
So it seemed to be the appropriate move."

CONFEREES SAY SOME OF THE STING CAN BE TAKEN OUT OF BEE MIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bee experts and agricultural officials, grappling with a projected "invasion" 
of Africanized bees into the United States as early as next spring, say the 
northward advance will not immediately herald a mass migration and could be 
slowed if enough information is disseminated. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal agriculture officials, gathered with international experts at 
a symposium Wednesday in Mission Valley, said educational efforts such as those 
under way in Mexico also would dramatically reduce fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the so-called "killer" bees decide to stay in the more temperate 
climates found in the United States -- Africanized bees prefer tropical to 
subtropical climes -- living with the insect is possible, the conferees said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected to Reach San Diego in 1993 
</P>
<P>
The bees will probably make their way into Texas from northern Mexico in one to 
three years, and officials expect the bees to enter California in 1993 -- in 
San Diego County if they make their way up Mexico's Pacific Coast, or Imperial 
County if the bees move west from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing that can be done right now is information (campaigns) 
to try to take away the idea of the 'killer' bee," said Elba Quintero, Mexico's 
program manager on the Africanized honey bee. "As soon as people hear 'killer 
bee,' there is a panic. The bee is not going to come in swarms and attack San 
Diego and the state of California. It doesn't work that way. The bee only 
defends itself when it feels threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, when the Africanized bees first made their way into Mexico, five 
people have reportedly died after being stung, Quintero said. By comparison, 
more than 70 people were reportedly killed in Venezuela in 1988 from the bees' 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temperament Earns It 'Killer' Nickname 
</P>
<P>
While the sting of an individual Africanized bee is no more venomous than that 
of the European bee common to the United States, its nasty temperament has 
earned it the nickname "killer bee." The Africanized bees are easily agitated, 
sting in larger swarms, and pursue a person for a longer period over a greater 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to destroy the bee, change its behavior or counterattack with a new 
breed have produced minimal results. Although the European and Africanized bees 
look identical, the latter is a hybrid of the two and is slightly smaller. 
Genetically, the traits of the Africanized bee are dominant when cross-breeding 
occurs. It takes an expert to tell the two apart.

<P>
By alerting beekeepers and setting traps to detect the bees' arrival, U. S. and 
Mexican officials hope to slow down the northward migration. They say that 
slowing the bees' progress is essential to allow time to develop emergency 
services to handle possible bee attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Given the bees' volatile disposition, officials are in the awkward position of 
alerting the public while striving to avoid mass hysteria, said Susan Golding, 
chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the wingspan of this little bee is less than 20 millimeters, the 
dread that it has generated cannot be accurately measured," Golding said. 
"Today we are not talking about something that is science fiction at all, even 
though a number of years ago it may have been thought to be. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice part of this particular disaster, if there is a nice part, is that we 
have time," she said. "The bad part is that we don't know much about this type 
(of disaster) because we haven't dealt with it before." 
</P>
<P>
The effect on California's estimated $15-million to $18-million apiary industry 
could be far-reaching. About 50% to 70% of the state's crops depend on bee 
pollination. Destroying hives to get rid of Africanized bees would have drastic 
results and has been ruled out, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Arrive in Darkening 'Mass' 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists feel the Africanized bee will not make it to the frigid 
northern regions of the United States. Others, however, believe that an altered 
strain will show up throughout North America. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the bees will not arrive in "a mass that will darken the sky," said Dr. 
James Tew, national program director of apiculture for the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture. The bees will probably migrate to the United States in single 
swarms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric Mussen, an apiculturist at the University of California at Davis, said 
he is unsure what effect the more temperate climate in the United States will 
have on the bees' behavior. (European bees are more easily agitated in colder 
weather.) 
</P>
<P>
"The habitat here might not be suited to (the Africanized bees') needs," Mussen 
said. "They need a year-round food supply. In Africa, when the food supply runs 
out, they pull out and swarm to other locations. Here, if it's winter, they 
still might not find other food locations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Types Could Coexist 
</P>
<P>
Mussen said skilled beekeepers will be able to prevent the Africanized bees 
from overtaking the commercial European hives. The two types of bees could 
coexist, though typically the drones of the African strain tend to infiltrate 
European hives. 
</P>
<P>
After an extended period, less volatile strains of the Africanized bees might 
be produced, much the way European bees were altered through selective breeding 
after they were introduced to the Americas in the late 1600s, Mussen said. 
Today's European bee is generally docile and more productive. 
</P>
<P>
The Africanized bees were introduced into the Western Hemisphere by scientists 
in Brazil in 1956. The bees escaped in 1957 and rapidly multiplied, heading 
north at the rate of 200 to 300 miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium, sponsored by the U. S. Department of Agriculture and the 
San Diego and Imperial County agricultural commissioners, ends today.

ASTRONAUT SALLY RIDE NAMED UCSD PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astronaut Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, will join UC San Diego 
as a physics professor next month and is expected to be named director of 
university's California Space Institute, a school official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ride, 38, will join the UCSD faculty as a full professor on July 1 and will be 
paid $64,000 a year, said Jackie Parker, spokeswoman for the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. The space institute is based at Scripps, and both 
institutions are part of the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
Parker said Ride's appointment as director of the space institute is expected 
to be announced Friday, after a meeting of the UC Board of Regents. The 
institute currently works with a $3.3-million annual research budget. It was 
created by the California Legislature in 1979. In addition to space research, 
the institute also meets with the state's aerospace industry on the research 
and development of new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ride was unavailable for comment on Wednesday, Scripps released a 
brief statement from her in which she expressed approval of her new positions. 
Ride is currently at Stanford University, where she is a fellow at the Center 
for International Security and Arms Control. 
</P>
<P>
During her career as an astronaut with the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, Ride flew in two space shuttle flights. She also was part of 
the team that investigated the accident of the space shuttle Challenger. Ride 
has been at Stanford since 1987. She holds several degrees from Stanford, 
including a doctorate in physics.

BRITISH AIRWAYS SELECTED TO FLY SOVIET FESTIVAL PERFORMERS, ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the San Diego Arts Festival have contracted with a commercial air 
carrier to transport Soviet participants here at a "substantial discount air 
fare," festival officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways was chosen over half a dozen other international air carriers 
because it offered savings "in excess of $175,000" and because of its daily 
London-to-San Diego service, festival executive director Bruce Herring said. 
Total round-trip fares from Moscow to San Diego with an overnight stop in 
London will run about $265,000 for the $6.25-million festival. 
</P>
<P>
"It saves us money to get (the performers) here as close as possible to the day 
they perform," Herring said, "and British Airways has everyday service." 
</P>
<P>
Airlines submitting proposals included Pan Am, TWA, SAS, American and FinnAir, 
"and British Airways had the best proposal," Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides providing "special VIP protocol service," including Soviet 
interpreters, the airline will fly religious art objects and one dozen Imperial 
Faberge eggs from Moscow, London, Paris and Zurich, Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
The eggs, which will be displayed at the San Diego Museum of Art, will be 
ferried in specially constructed cases. They will be insured while traveling 
with "nail to nail" coverage, that is, from the time the containers are closed 
to the moment they are opened, Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
250 Performers to Be Flown 
</P>
<P>
More than 250 Soviet musicians, performers, artists and government officials 
involved in the "Treasures of the Soviet Union" festival Oct. 21-Nov. 11 will 
be flown to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The event, which will include performances of an opera, two Russian plays and 
numerous folk arts and crafts exhibits and performances, is expected to attract 
large crowds of visitors to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Though tickets are available for the San Diego Opera's production of "Boris 
Godunov," tickets for most events do not go on sale until mid-July, Herring 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't placed ads yet," he said. "That'll be in conjunction with the 
ticket sales."

SCHOOLS SEEK TO BOLSTER COMPUTER CLASSES; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN IS URGED TO STREAMLINE PURCHASES, HELP TEACHERS, FIND MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At Standley Junior High School, teachers and students have access to 
well-equipped computer labs and the latest software that gives them more than 
simply video work sheets. The University City school also has a 
state-of-the-art telephone system and electronic library databases. 
</P>
<P>
But Standley can be contrasted with other San Diego city schools where 
old-fashioned switchboards and manual typewriters predominate in the office, 
and where computer use by students is on a hit-and-miss basis, depending on the 
particular interest of an individual teacher. 
</P>
<P>
And all schools can still fall prey to fast-talking salesmen eager to peddle 
their high-tech wares or may run into conflict-of-interest problems by not 
soliciting enough bids before making a selection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Standards Sought 
</P>
<P>
To try to establish better standards for all schools, a special task force 
Wednesday asked the Board of Education to set up a unique department of 
educational technology. Among other activities, the proposed department, an 
innovative move unusual among school districts, would help speed development of 
new technologies for area schools, provide assistance to teachers in putting 
new projects into schools, and identify outside funding. 
</P>
<P>
"The questions are how to determine the value of (technology), how to decide 
what to use, how to figure your return on investment, how to manage the 
technology and how to determine what (educational) product you want at the 
end," Terry Churchill, co-chair of the task force and area vice president for 
Pacific Bell, said Wednesday during a presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Together with setting up the department, the district would also draw up an 
ethical code to prevent potential conflicts of interest during the selection 
process by individual schools, which would still retain the authority to 
purchase the technology that they believe will best suit their educational 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"The district situation has been helter-skelter up until now," said Point Loma 
Principal Barbara Brooks, a leader in moving technology into the classroom and 
a member of the joint public-private committee on technology that wrote the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The extent to which a school has moved forward with technology -- both in the 
classroom and in the office -- has depended largely on the interest and 
knowledge of its teachers, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a tremendous amount of work by a teacher or teachers to spend their 
own time evaluating software, going to conferences, just being aware of what is 
going on," said Standley Principal Ernest Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Hours Spent 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Flanagan, principal of the visual arts Zamorano Elementary magnet, said 
she and her two resource teachers spent hundreds of hours two years ago poring 
through catalogues, talking to other teachers and visiting numerous schools in 
trying to pick the best computer system before they opened Zamorano. 
</P>
<P>
"A department would make a standard level of expertise available to all 
schools, sort of like having a technology fair so people have a central 
resource to draw on rather than having to depend on themselves," Calderon said. 
"It would not limit the creativity of individual schools but would channel it 
to other schools so that they can learn more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
The number of computers in the district has proliferated since first used in a 
wide-scale way in 1983, when Apple Computer donated equipment to every school 
in California. San Diego now has almost 8,000 machines across its 160 schools 
contrasted with 800 six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"People are more knowledgeable today," Point Loma's Brooks said. For example, 
one of her history teachers is attending Princeton University this summer on a 
special fellowship to learn about software available in social studies areas. 
</P>
<P>
But statewide, California ranks only 27th among all states in terms of the 
number of computers per student and too many schools rely on informal contacts 
and luck in planning their use of technology, technology advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of coordination, district administrators have become 
increasingly aware of the potential for poorly planned purchases and for 
conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some sites that went out and were swayed by the first 
salesperson they met into buying certain software and have subsequently become 
disenchanted," said Susan Reese, district vocational education director, who 
has closely followed San Diego's efforts since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apple Is Predominant 
</P>
<P>
Reese said that about 80% of all classroom computers in the district are 
manufactured by Apple, in large part because of the "brilliant marketing move" 
by the company in 1983 and the fact that most software was originally written 
for Apple and not for IBM and other brands. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon said the initial thrust by Apple has made it difficult for schools to 
use other manufacturers because teachers become accustomed to familiar software 
and to ease of maintenance. Earlier this year, he obtained 30 surplus Epson 
computers, which are IBM-compatible, as a way to introduce students to 
non-Apple apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my teachers asked whether we could sell the Epsons and buy more Apples 
instead," Calderon said. "But I believe that we should not just focus on one 
company but get exposure to as many technologies as possible." 
</P>
<P>
IBM is now making a major push to serve schools. It provides the computers in a 
new skills lab at Hoover High School that is being funded under a private 
foundation grant with ties to the computer company. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing competition, the district wants to set down 
guidelines on how evaluation and selection of technology should be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
"A school should be able to justify its selection of a particular company," 
Till said. "A lot of educators are naive about the business world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter of Ethics 
</P>
<P>
Till now attends computer technology conferences only at district expense. 
Several months ago, he accepted an invitation by Apple to attend a Washington, 
D.C., conference at the company's expense. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no purchases or anything going on but still, in retrospect, even though 
I was only there to get information, I agree it is hard to justify and it is 
cleaner if we pay ourselves," Till said. Last month, he went to another Apple 
conference but expenses were paid by the district. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said some oversight is desirable. She conceded that in theory, a 
principal could steer purchases toward a relative involved in computer sales 
and remain undiscovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that has happened, since we principals mainly rely on what our 
teachers want and what will make their programs go better, but yes, the 
potential (for mischief) is there." 
</P>
<P>
The district is also researching the educational benefits of using new 
technology as a follow-on to the committee recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"I am kind of shocked to say that there are not many studies as yet documenting 
educational improvements for students" from use of computers, Reese said. "I am 
a real advocate of technology and a lot of teachers talk about seeing gains, 
but as far as documented research to show reading, math, English growth, there 
isn't that much."

PRESERVATIONISTS WANT TO PROTECT COFFEE SHOP TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The organizer of a group asking that Los Angeles declare a Studio City carwash 
and gas station cultural landmarks will ask the city today to protect a 
neighboring coffee shop too. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McGrath said Wednesday he will formally request that the Los Angeles 
Cultural Heritage Commission consider a Tiny Naylor's restaurant for cultural 
landmark status as an example of distinctive 1950s coffee-shop architecture. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath and representatives of five Studio City community groups previously had 
asked that the neighboring 1950s-style gas station and 60-year-old carwash be 
declared landmarks to stall plans by the property's owner to build a 
$15-million, two-story shopping center on the site at the intersection of 
Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said he believes that the Cultural Heritage Commission, which considers 
preservation requests, will be more likely to grant historical status to the 
gas station and carwash if the popular coffee shop is included. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes sense that we include all three of the structures," McGrath said. 
"Tiny Naylor's has as much relevance to cultural and architectural status as do 
the carwash and gas station." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Prod, who bought the Tiny Naylor's chain in January, said he welcomes 
McGrath's proposal. "We're on a month-to-month lease, and we could be booted 
any time," Prod said. "If we have the opportunity of securing a long-term lease 
there, we're going to restore it to its original state." 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1960, the restaurant is an example of the pop-modernist, "Googie" 
architectural style popular among Southern California coffee shops in the 1950s 
and early 1960s, Prod said. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Handelman, a spokesman for the shopping center developer, declined to 
comment. "It will be up to the Cultural Heritage Commission to decide whether 
there is any merit to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to consider the applications at a meeting on 
Wednesday, said Nancy Fernandez, commission executive assistant. If approved, 
the requests will be sent to the City Council's recreation, library and 
cultural affairs subcommittee before going before the full council for a vote, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings designated cultural landmarks are spared from demolition for six 
months to a year, Fernandez said.

GARDENA BUDGET PROVIDES FOR 13 MORE POLICE OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gardena City Council has approved an increase of about $700,000 to the 
Gardena Police Department's 1989-90 budget, enabling the department to hire 13 
officers during the next two years to increase the force to 100 officers. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, part of a $34.7-million city budget approved by the council 
Tuesday night, will enable police to add a roving patrol car, which is not 
assigned to a specific area, to the five that cruise sections of the city, said 
Chief Richard K. Propster. 
</P>
<P>
The increase brings the annual Police Department budget to $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 30% decrease in violent crimes in the city so far this year from 
1988, and an overall decrease in crime of about 9%, the additional patrol car 
is needed to enable officers "to respond to those areas of the city where 
there's a demonstrated need for a high visibility patrol," Propster said. 
</P>
<P>
The additional patrol car would be available in about two years, the estimated 
time it will take to hire and train the 13 new officers needed to staff it 
round-the-clock, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Emergency Vehicle 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department budget increased by about $250,000, including funding for a 
specially equipped paramedic-fire truck. Funding for the vehicle was approved 
by the city in the wake of recent emergency room closures in the South Bay, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The total city budget has increased by 12.5% over last year's budget of $30.9 
million, and no new taxes or fee increases are anticipated, said City Manager 
Kenneth Landau. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a proposal Tuesday to adopt the budget every two 
years, with a one year council review, rather than on an annual basis. The 
two-year budget cycle will assist the city in formulating long-range financial 
plans and will cut down on time and money needed to prepare a budget on a 
yearly basis, city officials said.

AGREEMENT IS SOUGHT TO REOPEN CARD CLUB; 
</P>
<P>
CASINO EMPLOYEES PROTEST CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Employees of the Horseshoe Club are staging a weeklong protest outside the 
Gardena gambling casino to oppose its closing, while club owners and city 
officials seek to work out an agreement to reopen the facility, the city's 
oldest card club. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donald Dear said he has met with club General Manager Milt Corwin and 
prospective buyer Herbert Stern to discuss a new plan to bail out the club, 
which closed for remodeling on May 24 and may not reopen unless a financing 
plan is worked out. The city is involved in the negotiations because under 
state law, both the city and the state attorney general's office must license 
new casino owners and check their backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal, Stern, who had sought approval from the city to head a 
general partnership of new purchasers, would instead be general manager of the 
facility, City Manager Kenneth Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling of the 40-year-old casino at Rosecrans and Vermont avenues -- which 
was halted last week pending the outcome of negotiations between Stern and the 
city -- would resume and be paid for by the present owners, possibly through 
loans acquired against the property or from Stern, Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
When the refurbished club is opened, Stern eventually would buy out at least 
65% of the present ownership and would reapply to the city for a transfer of 
the operating license within four to six months, Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
Landau said he will meet with Stern on Friday to review the proposal. He said 
that the club could open at any time under its current ownership. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's City Council meeting, Dear requested that the Horseshoe Club's 
latest proposal be placed on the agenda for the June 27 council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In a related issue, the council unanimously passed an urgency ordinance Tuesday 
requiring the city's three card clubs to report terms and conditions of all 
loans, including existing loans, to the city manager within 10 days. City Atty. 
Michael Karger said the ordinance would help city officials ensure "that the 
(card club) industry is operating in a proper manner." 
</P>
<P>
"It is felt that by waiting a significant amount of time before we get the 
information, it may not be as accurate as we like; therefore, it is important 
to get it in as soon as possible," Karger said. The ordinance was effective 
immediately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In action last month on the proposed Horseshoe sale, the City Council tabled a 
proposal from Stern and his partner, Leonard Baum, after Stern and Baum 
objected to conditions city officials said must be met before a license 
transfer is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Among the five conditions set by the city were a demand that the new club 
owners procure a $6-million letter of credit to cover the first year of 
operation under new ownership, and set up a $180,000 escrow account to cover 
four weeks' pay for employees should the club fail. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Stern said the letter of credit and the escrow 
account were the main obstacles to meeting the city's conditions for the 
license transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, former president of the Commerce Casino, said he would be willing to 
agree to the other conditions set by the city, including an independent audit 
of club finances after one year, if the city paid for the audit. Stern said he 
severed ties with the Commerce Casino in 1986, and thus has already met another 
of the city's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said his lastest proposal to keep the club open would provide continuity 
to the club operations and get employees back to work as soon as possible. 
Normally, about 250 employees work at the Horseshoe, but the club was down to a 
crew of between 75 and 100 workers when it closed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed cost of buying the club remains about $4 million, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'300 People Employed' 
</P>
<P>
If the club is allowed to reopen under his management, Stern said, "the city 
would have 300 gainfully employed people, the 100 present employees plus 
another 200. And if my projections are correct, the city will get somewhere 
between $1 million and $1.5 million a year in additional revenues (from fees 
and taxes)." 
</P>
<P>
Stern said the club would expand from 31 tables to 52 tables after renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Club employees picketing this week, accompanied by some customers, said that if 
the Horseshoe closes permanently, they will lose their jobs and the city will 
lose revenue as well as a piece of its history. 
</P>

"This is the only thing I know after being here all this time," said Mary 
Campbell, who has been a chip girl at the Horseshoe for 32 years. "They told us 
it would reopen. That's why I have not looked for a job." 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Littleford, an employee coordinator who was one of about 50 people 
picketing earlier this week, said the city's demands on the prospective buyers 
were unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"No other club has had these kinds of restrictions," Littleford said. "If they 
don't give us a chance to reopen, a piece of Gardena history is going down the 
drain."

HOSPITAL WILL STOP OPERATING AS BASE STATION FOR PARAMEDICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, citing increased costs and 
demands on doctors and nurses, announced Tuesday it will no longer operate as a 
county paramedic base station, effective Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman will continue to accept and treat paramedic patients, however. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's action means that other area hospitals that operate base 
stations will have to absorb the 1,300 or so monthly paramedic radio calls that 
Freeman's medical staff handles. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals that serve as base stations supervise the treatment and transport of 
patients through radio contact with paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Price Hastings, who oversees paramedic operations for the county's 
Department of Health Services, said that patient care would not be affected by 
Freeman's decision. The only likely outcome will be a greater administrative 
workload for nearby hospitals that continue to operate base stations. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can spread it out evenly, I don't think it will be much of a problem," 
Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine paramedic ambulances from Inglewood and the fire departments from the city 
and county of Los Angeles are assigned to Freeman's base station, she said. 
Including Freeman, there are 33 base stations countywide. In the South Bay, 
there are at least four other hospitals that serve as base stations. Freeman 
has been trying to negotiate with county health officials over a number of 
issues, including several related to indigent care and how much the hospital 
should be compensated for it. The hospital asserts it is losing millions of 
dollars annually caring for a growing number of uninsured patients. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman Vice President James Barber said the hospital could reverse itself and 
keep the base station open if agreement is reached on some of these issues.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL VOTES ITSELF A 5% RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council has given itself a 5% pay raise, lifting the 
monthly salary of council members from $600 to $630. 
</P>
<P>
The council, without comment, gave final approval to an ordinance enacting the 
pay hike Tuesday night. The five-member council meets at least twice a month, 
often for four or five hours. The council also holds at least one informal 
study session each month. The state government code allows municipalities to 
raise council salaries 5% a year.

WOMAN TELLS OF HAMMER ATTACK IN PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 51-year-old woman testified Wednesday that a Tarzana shopping center owner 
hurled a claw hammer through the glass of her car window, puncturing her face, 
because her auto partially blocked a handicapped parking space. 
</P>
<P>
Marilynn Packer testified in Van Nuys Superior Court that Robert Alan Wall, 49, 
"swung that hammer as powerfully as he could right through my window." Packer 
said the claw end of the hammer punctured the right side of her face, breaking 
her cheekbone and knocking out several teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Packer said Wall then climbed through the broken window and "started to hit me 
with his fists while trying to pull the keys out" of the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, 49, is charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to commit 
great bodily harm for the May 28, 1988, incident at Wall Street Plaza in the 
18600 block of Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when Packer parked her car in a manner that partially 
blocked an adjacent space for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Richard S. Plotkin told the jury that his client and a 
shopping center security guard had repeatedly asked Packer to move her car and 
that she responded by swearing at them. 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin said that when his client tried to make a citizen's arrest, Packer 
tried to drive off, injuring three people, including Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Packer testified that when a security guard asked her to move her car, she told 
him that she only wanted to make a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned, Packer testified, her car was blocked by Wall's 
Mercedes-Benz and he told her that he had called a tow truck. 
</P>
<P>
Packer said a car in an adjacent space departed, and that as she tried to 
maneuver around the Mercedes to leave, Wall grabbed a hammer from the trunk of 
his car and hurled it through her window. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Wall faces a maximum sentence of eight years in prison, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Simon Hiller.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWNDALE TRIMS BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By trimming expenditures in all departments studied so far, the Lawndale City 
Council has cut about $180,775 from the city's proposed $7.8-million budget for 
1989-90. Some of the savings will be offset by a council decision to allow 5% 
cost-of-living increases for 15 to 20 part-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
Still hanging in the balance are the jobs of six city employees targeted for 
layoffs as the council seeks to raise $418,592 to pay for increased Sheriff's 
Department services. The council will meet at 6 p.m. today to complete their 
budget recommendations, and the layoffs probably will not be decided upon until 
a 7 p.m. public hearing June 19. 
</P>
<P>
At the council's third budget workshop Tuesday night, Blanche Cramer announced 
that about 80 senior citizens at the city's Prairie Avenue Community Center 
have signed petitions urging the council not to cut back on personnel or 
programs there. 
</P>
<P>
Cramer called the proposed layoffs of six workers, some with 12 to 17 years 
with the city, "cruel and thoughtless," and said that if jobs and programs are 
eliminated, seniors will fight back next April when three council members will 
be up for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"You too can be replaced," she said.

ACTION ON HERMOSA VIDEO SALES DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hermosa Beach City Council, acting on a recommendation from its former 
interim city attorney, has delayed action on a proposed ordinance that would 
restrict video sales and rentals to the commercial strip along Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Remelmeyer, who relinquished the interim post after undergoing heart 
surgery, suggested the delay to allow time for his successor, Charles S. Vose, 
to review the proposed ordinance. No date was set for receiving Vose's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Atty. James Lough had advised the council that the measure, which 
would ban video sales and rentals from neighborhood commercial (C-1) and 
restricted commercial (C-2) zones, might be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose early this year when some residents complained that Hermosa 
Video, a new store on Hermosa Avenue in the downtown area, was renting adult 
movies. Scott Gallagher, the store's owner, said that he had a legal right to 
offer his customers a selection of adult-rated movies to compete with other 
outlets. Adult movies make up only about 8% of his stock, he said, and as a 
result it does not fall under zoning restrictions that bar adult-oriented 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it a day at a time until we hear what the new city attorney has 
to say," Gallagher said Wednesday.

DR. JOSEPH STOKES III, 1ST DEAN OF UCSD MEDICAL SCHOOL, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Stokes III, the first dean of the UC San Diego School of Medicine 
and an internationally known expert in preventive medicine and cardiovascular 
epidemiology, died of cancer Monday in Boston at the age of 64. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes, born in Philadelphia, was the fourth generation of doctors in his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert N. Hamburger, his former assistant dean at the school of medicine 
and professor of pediatrics at UCSD, called Stokes one of the finest doctors he 
has ever known. Hamburger and Stokes were friends during the 18 years Stokes 
was on the faculty at the school of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes served as dean of the school of medicine from 1964 to 1966 and was 
instrumental in establishing the structure and direction for the school by 
recruiting some of its first faculty and creating strong ties with the general 
science departments on campus. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Stokes left UCSD to join the faculty at the Boston University School 
of Medicine. He was also co-principal investigator of the Framingham Heart 
Study -- a project in a city in which all the inhabitants are monitored by 
doctors -- where he worked until a month before his death. 
</P>
<P>
He was recently awarded the Distinguished Service Award from the American 
College of Preventive Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1949 and received his training 
at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He served as editor of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and 
associate editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes is survived by his wife, Ruth Whitson Stokes; sons Peter Whitson Stokes, 
J. Barclay Stokes and Joseph Stokes; daughter Margaret Stokes Holt, and three 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
He will be cremated and a service will be held Friday in Cambridge, Mass.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A transient arrested Tuesday for allegedly courting women and then conning them 
out of money and property will be arraigned this week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Martinelli, 50, is being held in San Diego County Jail on suspicion of 
burglary and grand theft. Bail has been set at $200,000, a jail spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinelli, also known as Raymond Harry Stone or Richard Stone, was arrested on 
Broadway Street in El Cajon by detectives from the San Diego and El Cajon 
police departments. 
</P>
<P>
Martinelli allegedly befriended women between 30 and 50 years old and 
eventually moved in with them, said San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
He then asked them to wire money -- sometimes as much as $2,500 -- to a false 
address in Indiana, where he said his relatives owned property and needed a 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
After the women complied, he would allegedly intercept the wire without their 
knowledge and steal the money, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the alleged con-man used this method to dupe at least four East 
County women, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego and El Cajon detectives are still searching for other women who may 
have been victimized, Robinson said. They also are seeking information about 
what appears to be a hotel key recovered from Martinelli. 
</P>
<P>
The key is marked with the number 305 in red plastic, but that number had been 
covered by tape with the number 405 written on it, Robinson said. Police 
believe the room may be the site of property allegedly stolen by Martinelli.

<P>
A seventh defendant to be charged with grand theft in connection with the 
purchasing irregularities case involving the San Diego Unified Port District 
pleaded innocent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Barry Lewis, 44, surrendered and was arraigned in San Diego Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was charged with conspiracy to defraud the port and six counts of grand 
theft in a complaint filed on June 7. A warrant was issued for his arrest then. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is a computer consultant who operates his own firm from his Spring Valley 
home. He was employed by the Port District to provide computer consulting 
services from mid-1986 to June, 1987, according to the complaint. According to 
the charges, Lewis charged computers and equipment to NAPA Auto Parts as part 
of an elaborate scheme in which NAPA sent the invoices to the Port District, 
which paid them. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was not authorized to have the items billed to the Port District, 
according to a declaration attributed to Bruce Hollingsworth, chief 
administrator for the port. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Thompson set an Aug. 1 arraignment and allowed Lewis to remain free 
on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lengthy preliminary hearing of three other men charged with 
similar offenses continues today before Municipal Judge Nicholas Kasimatis. 
They are former Port District parking meter repairman Rudi Enriques; Richard 
Cersosimo, the former purchasing director for the port, and Paul Manes, the 
former manager of a NAPA store.

TONY CLARK TO TRANSFER TO CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Clark, section basketball player of the year and a first-team all-section 
baseball pick as a junior, has announced he will transfer from Valhalla and 
play his senior year at Christian High School in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Clark led the county in basketball scoring with 29.3 points a game for the 
Norsemen and also led the county in home runs (11). He said he doesn't know 
much about the athletic programs at Christian but that he plans on playing both 
sports for the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
His decision was based on the private school's "attitude and atmosphere, not 
athletics," Clark said. "Primarily, the decision was made by my parents. They 
were concerned about my moral values. They thought I would be surrounded by 
people with a positive attitude there." 
</P>
<P>
For Clark to be eligible at Christian, he must have a section "public/private 
transfer" form signed by Valhalla Principal Bob Avant. Clark said rumors were 
circulating that Avant was reluctant to sign the form, but "there should be no 
problem," he said. "As of now, it's going as it was drawn up." 
</P>
<P>
Avant could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Christian, of the City Central League, competes in smaller-school Division IV 
in the playoffs. Valhalla is a Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition doesn't really make any difference," he said. "City league 
teams are supposed to be better. From that standpoint, the level of competition 
will rise." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: BISHOP MONTGOMERY LOSES 11 PLAYERS -- BUT NOT SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As athletic director of Bishop Montgomery High, Steve Carroll does a good job 
of promoting the school's attractive features. He speaks of the rigorous 
academic environment, the emphasis on discipline and the well-rounded sports 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, though, he has fought an uphill battle on the athletic front. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, Bishop Montgomery's weight room has been 
burglarized of at least $6,000 in equipment, 11 projected football starters 
have transferred and the basketball coach has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some problems, without a doubt," Carroll said. "But I think our 
reputation speaks for itself. If a kid wants to get the best education he can 
and the best things athletically, he'll consider our school." 
</P>
<P>
But how will the school's recent problems affect athletics? 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery, struggling to stay afloat in the competitive waters of the 
Angelus League, suffered its latest setback Monday when basketball Coach Tony 
Carter resigned after one season. His replacement will become the sixth 
basketball coach at the school in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll hopes to find a new coach within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the losses incurred by the football team may be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Since Carroll was named football coach earlier this year, the Knights have lost 
11 projected starters to other schools. Included in that group are three who 
now attend Banning, most notably All-Angelus League wide receiver Sheldon 
Butler and quarterback Marty Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Banning Coach Joe Dominguez says Butler, a junior, has a good chance of 
starting for the Pilots next season and Garcia, a sophomore, will probably back 
up returning All-Pacific League quarterback John Ma'ae. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, those are major losses for Bishop Montgomery, which has never 
qualified for the CIF-Southern Section playoffs from the Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dwelling on the losses, however, Carroll is determined to win with 
the remaining players. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken our lumps, but the kids we have now are fantastic," he said. "I 
don't know if we're going to win the league title, but we're going to have a 
successful year one way or another. The kids are hard workers." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll says the players who transferred left for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost (some) kids to academics, four or five to discipline problems and 
three or four because they have moved on to what they think are greener 
pastures," said the native Texan. "I was brought up in another age, I never 
thought about transferring schools. Down around here, it's rampant. 
</P>
<P>
"If a kid doesn't like the school or the coach, he can decide he wants to go 
somewhere else. I'm not in favor of it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Carroll, who succeeded Andy Szabatura as football coach after last 
season, alienated some players by implementing mandatory weightlifting for all 
levels. Carroll said mandatory lifting was limited to varsity players in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I did catch a few people off guard," he said. "You might lose a few kids 
in the beginning, but everybody seems to know the rules from then on and you 
don't have any more problems." 
</P>
<P>
For Carroll, that would be a welcomed change. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who coached Bishop Montgomery's basketball team to a 9-13 record last 
season, said he resigned because of financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing negative about the job except the pay," he said. "I liked 
the administration and the faculty. I thought the basketball program would get 
better every year. I liked all the kids in the program." 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who has coached basketball for 10 years, including stints as an 
assistant at Cal State Dominguez Hills and Torrance High, said he is going into 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where I wanted a little more financial security," he said. 
"There's not much security in coaching. I just wanted something that was more 
lucrative and has more conventional-type hours." 
</P>
<P>
Under Carter, the Knights opened the season with a 9-4 record but went 0-8 in 
the tough Angelus League, losing six games by six points or less. The team 
returns several key players, including all-league junior guard Darryl Daniels, 
who led the Knights with an 18-point scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he has recommended a few coaching candidates that he hopes the 
Bishop Montgomery administration will consider. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they hire somebody I recommended because they would keep my same 
(assistant) coaches and have the same coaching philosophy. All four levels ran 
the same offense and defense last year. It's important to have continuity if 
you want to establish a winning program." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said the school is accepting applications for a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
"(Carter's recommendations) are something we are considering," he said. "But 
we're not going to sacrifice for consistency. We're going to hire the best guy 
we can get." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, the Banning football coach, lost perhaps the best player in his 
program last February when All-L.A. City fullback Derek Sparks transferred to 
Montclair Prep in Van Nuys.

<P>
However, Dominguez isn't worried about replacing the talented sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
He says Travis Davis, a 6-foot, 185-pound sophomore with excellent speed, could 
be the next great Banning running back. Davis played defensive back for the 
Pilots last season and is perhaps best remembered for running down Carson 
wingback Larry Billoups, the Colts' fastest player, in the L.A. City 4-A 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's really going to be something," Dominguez said of Davis. "I 
wouldn't be surprised if he runs for 1,100 or 1,200 yards next year." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger pitcher Tyrone Scott, a fourth-round draft choice of the Houston 
Astros, signed last week and will report to the Astros' rookie league affiliate 
in Florida on June 23, the day after his graduation. Terms of Scott's contract 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside junior Lisa Leslie was the only high school player selected to the 
U.S. Junior National women's basketball team last week during tryouts in 
Colorado Springs. The 6-foot-5 Leslie begins practice July 5 before leaving on 
a tour that will take the team to New York, Spain and France.

ALVARADO WON PLAYERS' RESPECT AND A CITY TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it the last step, the final act in a conversion process from outsider to 
trusted leader. 
</P>
<P>
There Manny Alvarado stood, or at least he was trying to stand. He was bent at 
the waist, gasping for air as desperately as any of his players on the Kennedy 
High baseball field. The Golden Cougars awaited the next words from their coach 
as they recuperated from a fatiguing set of wind sprints run across the 
outfield grass. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that day, Kennedy fell flat in a 4-2 loss to Cleveland when a victory 
would have clinched the North Valley League title. After the bus ride back to 
Granada Hills, Alvarado assembled the team and ordered the extra work. 
</P>
<P>
As the players chugged through their first 40-yard dash, there was Alvarado, 
running just as hard as those half his age. When he halted the sprints and 
addressed the team after catching his breath, the words were superfluous. The 
message already had been delivered: All shared blame for the defeat, starting 
with the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the guys that I must have done something wrong," Alvarado said 
recalling the incident. "We were playing for the league title and we got only 
six hits and two runs, so I guess we weren't ready to play. That's my job and I 
didn't do a good one. That was just the way I approached it. It wasn't a 
coaching ploy but it worked out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy rebounded two days later with a 7-5 victory over San Fernando to clinch 
the league title and start a five-game winning streak that culminated in the 
City Section 4-A Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado, at 35 the head coach of his first varsity team, led the Golden 
Cougars to a 4-3 win over Palisades in the final at Dodger Stadium and has been 
named The Times' Valley Coach of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Alvarado was a stranger to the Kennedy players. After an eight-year 
absence from high school coaching, Alvarado returned in 1988 to work as an 
unpaid assistant to San Fernando Coach Steve Marden. When he was awarded the 
Kennedy job last June after Dick Whitney resigned to become the school's 
athletic director, players wondered, "Who is this guy?" 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a 'Who?' We had no idea who he was," senior pitcher Mitch 
Cizek said. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado, the unknown quantity, walked into a difficult situation. Kennedy's 
was no sagging program looking for a savior. The Golden Cougars were a veteran 
team: Eight of the projected starters for 1989 were seniors-to-be. Expectations 
ran high. Kennedy had won two City titles in the 1980s and was Mid-Valley 
League champion in '88. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people told me I had my hands full," Alvarado said. "There were a lot of 
seniors and I was expected to win right away. You had to introduce yourself, 
deal with the players and the community and win all at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Given the circumstances, Alvarado chose a soft-sell approach, which is 
fortuitous because that's his only approach. Quiet and unassuming at 5-foot-8, 
140 pounds, he tiptoed into the program. No sweeping changes were ordered. No 
dramatic manifestoes were issued. 
</P>
<P>
When practice opened in February, Alvarado got a break. Team rules dictate 
prompt arrival at all practice sessions and look who showed up late for one of 
the first workouts: team leaders Gino Tagliaferri and Pat DeBoer, both seniors. 
The two formed Kennedy's double-play combination and were three-year lettermen. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado waited for no explanations. As soon as the pair hit the field, he 
banished them to the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I made them run until I got tired," Alvarado said. "You have to set limits and 
stick to your guns. When a rule is broken, you have to fix it. In a way, it was 
a blessing in disguise. I don't know if it made an impression, but they weren't 
late again." 
</P>
<P>
DeBoer accepted the discipline as payment for membership on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no resentment because I knew I deserved it," he said. "I had a good 
feeling that it was going to happen as soon as I got in the parking lot. We 
thought it was going to be hard to get adjusted to him but it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
With the ground rules established, Kennedy embarked on the season but received 
bad news one week out of the gate when star center fielder Shawn Madden, who 
has signed a letter of intent with Stanford, suffered an injured right 
shoulder. His status remained unclear for a couple of weeks before he underwent 
surgery in April and was lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that lit a fire under us a little more, especially when we found out 
for sure he was through for the season," Alvarado said. "There was no more 
doubt. James Campbell rose to the occasion as his replacement and the kids 
started playing better." 
</P>
<P>
With his team in stride and heading toward a league title, Alvarado was thrown 
a curve when teachers staged a walkout against the Los Angeles Unified School 
District and the 4-A baseball coaches boycotted the season. The baseball 
coaches stood alone along the sidelines while playoffs continued in all other 
City sports. 
</P>
<P>
The season seemed doomed when City officials canceled the 4-A playoffs May 23, 
the day before the postseason tournament was scheduled to begin. Pressure 
mounted at many schools to force coaches back to work or stage the playoffs 
without them. 
</P>
<P>
Players faced conflicting emotions, torn between their desire to play and 
loyalty to their coaches. A few teams voted to boycott until the coaches 
returned, others demanded to play despite the coaches' absence. Kennedy, with a 
senior-dominated lineup, sent a player delegation into Principal James Ball's 
office to demand to play. Alvarado, a rookie coach, saw his team slipping away 
from him. Ironically, Alvarado made his players sign a contract before the 
season, binding all to a full commitment to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult decision to strike but I didn't feel like I deserted the 
kids," he said. "But I feared losing their respect and I worried about my 
relationship with them." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado kept in contact with the team through Tagliaferri and Cizek and when 
the strike ended May 25 and the playoffs were reinstated, the team met for a 
hastily called practice. Afterward, Alvarado led an emotional team meeting 
conducted at high volume. Embittered players shouted out their anger, claiming 
that they felt abandoned by their coach. Instead of trying to quiet his players 
or talk them out of their feelings, Alvarado let them rant. 
</P>
<P>
"I encouraged it," he said. "If there was any animosity or bitterness, I told 
them to show it. I made no excuses for what I did and when the meeting was 
over, there was a mutual respect for each other. I told them they had their 
chance to vent, now it was back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
One week later, Kennedy formed a human pile behind the pitcher's mound at 
Dodger Stadium in celebration of its City championship. 
</P>
<P>
"The team was really divided during the strike -- half were for him and half 
against him," Cizek said. "I felt abandoned but after the meeting I realized he 
had a higher responsibility. I still had to be behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like after the Cleveland game. He was with us and took the loss as hard 
as we did. He showed that he didn't punk out on us when we lost." 
</P>
<P>
So, Alvarado's rocky road to leadership of the Kennedy program seems complete, 
but a loose end remains. He's still a walk-on coach. He is a physical education 
teacher at Sepulveda Junior High and is trying to find a position at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, Alvarado left the school district a bitter man. After 
graduating from Cal State Northridge in 1978, he joined the district as a 
teacher and junior varsity baseball coach at San Fernando, his alma mater. He 
had worked as an unpaid assistant at San Fernando for three years while 
completing his degree, but after two years he lost his job as part of a 
district-wide cutback. 
</P>
<P>
He took a job at Pride House, a home for troubled teen-age boys in Van Nuys, 
and coached the softball, basketball and flag football teams. His teams won and 
he enjoyed the work, but the itch to return as a high school coach needed 
scratching. 
</P>
<P>
"I would run into old friends on the street and they'd ask me where I was 
coaching," he said. "They expected me to be coaching at a high school 
somewhere. Our Pride House teams never got much ink." 
</P>
<P>
He left Pride House for Sepulveda Junior High in 1986 as a first step back. A 
year later, when he contacted Marden about a job, he was welcomed back to San 
Fernando with open arms. After one year with the Tigers, Marden recommended him 
for the position at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado brought more than Marden's recommendation with him to Kennedy. Said 
Alvarado with a sly grin: "I stole quite a bit from Steve." 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a lot of the things that we do over at Kennedy this year," Marden said, 
good-naturedly. "I saw his infielders relaying each pitch to the outfield like 
we do, and moving players based on the pitch thrown like we do. He had guys 
scouting teams and they were using a San Fernando scout sheet." 
</P>
<P>
He may be hungry for a position at Kennedy, but the Golden Cougars' rookie 
coach freely admits, "There's still a lot of Tiger in me." 
</P>
<P>
And with a little help from Marden, he is back in the coaching fraternity.

ATHLETICS HAD GOOD YEAR ON FIELD, BETTER AT THE BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Bistline began his job as associate athletic director in charge of 
athletic development and promotion at Cal State Dominguez Hills with what 
seemed like a simple task: convincing a Carson restaurant to donate 10 pizzas 
for a postgame party for the men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
About half a day and a dozen phone calls later, Bistline got the free pasta. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of his fund-raising in the past six months has been that easy, but 
because of his persistence the Toro athletic program is $45,000 richer. 
</P>
<P>
"We not only had a great year on the field, but we had a tremendous year in 
fund raising," said Athletic Director Dan Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
Bistline, 34, who held a similar post at Cal State Fullerton, lives in Redondo 
Beach. He sees Dominguez Hills as an underdog in athletic fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the greatest philanthropic environment in the world," he said of 
Southern California. "It's a challenge to go out there and get after it." 
</P>
<P>
Bistline was barely on the job in March when Cal State Bakersfield shocked the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. by bidding $24,000, the most in NCAA 
Division II history, to host a regional basketball playoff. The site: the 
Roadrunners' two-week old, 3,900-seat gymnasium, of which one-half of its $1.5 
million price was paid for by donations. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield's bid was considered a coup because it possibly was influential in 
obtaining a postseason playoff berth for its basketball team, which tied for 
third behind Dominguez Hills in CCAA play. The incident drew media attention to 
the CCAA and caused a basketball coach to accuse Bakersfield of buying a spot 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to the fund-raising fire, Chapman College reportedly paid former 
USC Coach Bob Boyd $70,000, an apartment and car to coach its basketball team. 
Chapman, a private school in Orange, receives most of its budget from fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
Those moves underscore the importance of fund raising for athletic programs in 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Bistline says it's unfair to draw similarities between Bakersfield and 
Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"In Bakersfield, Cal State Bakersfield is the only show in town," he said. But 
he agreed that for Dominguez Hills to compete in the CCAA against teams like 
the Roadrunners it must seek donations from outside sources. 
</P>
<P>
However, "a fund-raising effort must be well coordinated or it will have a 
negative impact a couple of years later," he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills officials would like to see Bistline tap the growing number of 
corporations in the South Bay, particularly those in the rapidly expanding 
commercial zones along the San Diego Freeway in Carson. In addition, the large 
Asian student population at Dominguez Hills could lead to better relations with 
Pacific Rim companies that have relocated here. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor logos in the Toro Gymnasium and on the university baseball, softball 
and soccer fields should start to pop up soon, Bistline said. 
</P>
<P>
His ultimate goal is "to see that each athletic program at Dominguez Hills is 
capable of offering the maximum amount of scholarships allowed by the NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
Of immediate concern for Bistline, however, was the acquisition of his own 
telephone and file cabinet. The phone was installed this week. Previously, 
Bistline shared a line with Sports Information Director Thomas Neff, and often 
the line was tied up by incoming calls. PAUL McLEOD

HENSON FINDS THE GROOVE IN PANORAMA CITY VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Left-hander Sean Henson gave up two singles and a triple to the first three 
batters he faced but settled down to finish with a six-hitter as Panorama City 
defeated North Hollywood, 4-3, in a District 20 Eastern Division game at Monroe 
High on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Henson (2-1) gave up three runs in the first inning on a two-run triple by 
Duane Braxton and a sacrifice fly by Harry Marks but struck out six and walked 
two the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Garcia scored the winning run for Panorama City (5-2) in the fourth when 
Joe Cascione's ground ball was booted for an error. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Newhall-Saugus 7, Quartz Hill 2 -- Trailing, 1-0, in the bottom of the third, 
Newhall-Saugus (5-1) scored six runs in a Northern Division game at Saugus 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Left fielder Kevin Backes capped the six-run outburst with a grand slam. 
Right-hander Scott Thomason (1-0) threw a five-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Encino-Crespi 4, Glendale 2 -- Dan Carroll allowed two runs on eight hits, 
struck out nine and walked four in 6 1/3 innings for Encino-Crespi (4-2) in an 
inter-division game at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills West 4, Reseda 3 -- Woodland Hills West held a one-run lead in 
the top of the sixth inning when the sprinklers came on and disrupted the

date. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa 9, Westlake-Agoura 9 -- Brian Smith hit a three-run home run for 
Westlake-Agoura in the first, but Rio Mesa scored seven times in the fifth in a

OVERWHELMING VOTE GIVES HILLS SLATE CONTROL OF OAK INDUSTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oak Industries director Roderick M. Hills on Wednesday wrested control of San 
Diego-based Oak from Chairman E.L. McNeely, after an official tally showed that 
Hills' slate won an overwhelming victory at the company's June 6 annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Hills' five-member slate won 77% of the 53.5 million votes cast during the 
emotionally charged annual meeting, while McNeely's slate drew just 23%, 
according to Oak General Counsel Jim Miller. In addition, three representatives 
of MIM Ltd., a British firm that owns 25% of Oak's shares, also were elected to 
the board by overwhelming margins. 
</P>
<P>
During the hotly contested proxy fight leading up to the June 6 vote, Hills 
credited McNeely with helping to turn around Oak, which generated $300 million 
in net losses before McNeely's arrival. But Hills maintained that Oak would not 
end a long-running string of quarterly operating losses until McNeely stepped 
aside and appointed a chief operating officer with industrial experience. Oak 
owns several operating companies that make electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
Hills said Wednesday that he anticipated no lingering effects of the bitter 
proxy fight, during which McNeely and Hills attacked each other's business 
experience. "Ed McNeely graciously accepted a position on the board and 
everything is peaceful," according to Hills, who has described McNeely as a 
"longtime friend." 
</P>
<P>
McNeely's defeated board slate earlier this week decided not to contest the 
election results in court, Miller said. McNeely on June 6 alleged that MIM and 
Hills were guilty of Securities and Exchange Commission violations during the 
proxy contest. 
</P>
<P>
Lord David Stevens of Ludgate, chairman of MIM, was elected as Oak's new 
chairman during a telephonic board meeting held Wednesday. Hills, a Washington 
investment banker and lawyer who first joined Oak board's in 1985, was elected 
vice chairman. Stevens was in Japan on Wednesday and unavailable for comment, 
according to a Boston-based spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The new board elected McNeely to serve as Oak's ninth board member. McNeely, 
who joined Oak's board in 1983 and became chairman in 1984, also was 
unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hills, Stevens and McNeely, Oak's new board includes former U.S. 
Atty. Elliot L. Richardson, San Diego businessman Daniel W. Derbes, San Diego 
Economic Development Corp. Chairman George Leisz and Gilbert Mathews, a senior 
managing partner of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., a New York-based investment 
banking firm. Also elected were MIM Managing Director Christopher H.B. Mills 
and William D. Eberle, a Boston businessman who was nominated by MIM. 
</P>
<P>
Hills, whose wife, Carla, is the Bush Administration's special trade 
representative, began the proxy fight for control of Oak in March after McNeely 
decided not to nominate him for a second term on Oak's board. 
</P>
<P>
Oak was unchanged in over-the-counter trading Wednesday at $1.375. The stock 
has traded at about $1 for two years.

A BLACK HOLE ON THE SAN DIEGO THEATER SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
EVERYBODY LOSES WHEN ACTORS CAN'T FIND ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where can you go these days to see gifted black San Diego actors perform? 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles. New York. Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the answer is anywhere but San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
That is distressing for both aspiring black actors who need a stage to practice 
on and for the black director in town, Floyd Gaffney, who has been trying to 
put together a professional black theater company in San Diego for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we can catch people on the way up," Gaffney said. "You go out and, if 
you're lucky, you'll get someone talented who's moving through, like Hassan 
El-Amin, but soon he'll be gone again." 
</P>
<P>
It is a Catch-22 in which nobody wins. Without professional black theater 
artists, there can be no resident black theater company. Without a black 
theater company, there is no source of income that will allow professional 
black artists to make a living here. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of theater about the black experience, black audiences -- who 
are still not in the theatergoing habit -- don't show up. Without black 
audiences coming to mainstream theaters, theater companies will not see such 
programming as in their interest when planning a season schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Although leading theaters such as the Old Globe Theatre and the La Jolla 
Playhouse may feature black actors in August Wilson plays (at the Globe) or 
original works like "Shout Up a Morning" (at the Playhouse), their shows are 
usually cast from New York or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Wilson plays, the casts come intact from the Yale Repertory 
Theatre. As one observer who sympathized with the practice of casting elsewhere 
confided, "I couldn't find the quality of black actors I would need to cast in 
town." 
</P>
<P>
The closest thing San Diego has to a black theater troupe is the Southeast 
Community Theatre, which produced "Williams and Walker," which just closed at 
the Lyceum Space on Sunday, and plans to present "Black Nativity," a gospel 
Christmas play at the Educational Cultural Complex in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Community Theatre is the place where Cleavon Little, a Southeast 
San Diego native, and Whoopi Goldberg performed in their years here. But the 
status of the Southeast Community Theater, which, after 25 years, has yet to 
find a home or scrape together enough money for more than two plays a season, 
symbolizes the precarious nature of black theater in San Diego as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
The homelessness of the Southeast Community Theatre is a sore spot for the 
black theater community. 
</P>
<P>
Another painful subject is the collapse of the Southern California Black 
Repertory Theatre, which flourished in the late 1970s under a variety of names 
including the Wing and a Prayer Repertory Company and the Rainbow Repertory 
Company. The short-lived company collapsed not long after two of its founders, 
actors James Avery and John Wesley, left to pursue their careers in San 
Francisco and then Los Angeles, where they continue to work in television and 
film. 
</P>
<P>
When that organization went, black actors had to again leave San Diego if they 
wanted to find work as professionals. 
</P>
<P>
El-Amin, born and raised in Southeast San Diego, remembers looking up to Avery 
and Wesley as role models. El-Amin just finished playing the legendary Bert 
Williams in the poignant Southeast Community Theatre production of "Williams 
and Walker," which Avery and Wesley returned home to see. 
</P>
<P>
It was a part that hit close to home for El-Amin, Avery, Wesley and the scores 
of black artists who attended, but never managed to fill, the 200-seat space. 
Opening night brought fewer than 10 people into the theater; by the end of the 
four-week run, about 100-150 were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was a turn-of-the-century black vaudevillian who managed to break the 
color barrier at the Ziegfeld Follies, but only by agreeing to put black 
greasepaint on his face and chalk up his eyes and lips a glaring white. That is 
how the audiences expected blacks to look, whether they were being played by 
white or black performers. 
</P>
<P>
Williams longed to play Hamlet but was limited to the stereotypical roles 
epitomized by the blackface make-up. 
</P>
<P>
El-Amin, who will leave San Diego in September to pursue his master's degree in 
classical acting at the University of Delaware, would also like to play Hamlet 
someday, but he realizes that it is unlikely that a black actor in America 
would be offered such a part. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the limitations of the parts you can do as black actors, things 
haven't changed a lot," El-Amin said. 
</P>
<P>
"The situations are similar. I'm going to 
</P>
<P>
school to become a classically trained actor, even though I know my ability to 
do these classical parts is limited. I understand the obstacles before me, but 
I want to be trained, I want to be prepared. And hopefully, a change will come 
about." Most of those who stick around San Diego waiting for the changes are 
those anchored here by other jobs or their family. 
</P>
<P>
Equity actress Sylvia M'Lafi Thompson is cultural affairs director for the 
Education Cultural Center (ECC) and vice chairwoman of the San Diego Commission 
of Art and Culture. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Veronica Henson-Phillips, who most recently played the maid in the 
Gaslamp Quarter Theatre production of "The Little Foxes," is a native Southeast 
San Diegan who stays here because of her family. She gets most of her work in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Anasa Briggs-Graves has been limiting her acting to her television show 
on KPBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is now playing a part that calls for a black actress, the nurse in the 
Gaslamp Quarter Theatre production of "The Day Room." It is her second play in 
three years here, a fact she blames on the lack of roles for black actors in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here in the latter part of 1983, was in one play at the (now-defunct) 
Fiesta Dinner Theatre and produced a play by Athol Fugard at Southeast," 
Thompson said. "I understudied at the Old Globe and didn't do another play 
until the job at the Gaslamp came up. Am I frustrated? You better believe it." 
</P>
<P>
For Bonnie Ward, assistant managing director of the Southeast Community Theatre 
(not to be confused with Bonnie Ward, the co-artistic director of Starlight 
Musical Theatre), "Williams and Walker" is sadly analogous to the black theater 
experience today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a painful period, and yet it is like what life is like in America for the 
African-American today. There isn't much space for the artists to perform 
because the parts are limited. There isn't much space for the new playwrights 
who have yet to be, and the old playwrights who have work yet to be discovered. 
We have put in a lot of hard work, blood, sweat and tears, and we have not yet 
scratched the surface." 
</P>
<P>
Ward's efforts right now are concentrated on finding the Southeast a permanent 
home, or at least an office to call its own. Avery and Wesley, close friends 
who now live in Los Angeles, find steady work in movies and television. Wesley 
-- who changed his name from John Huston to John Wesley so as not to be 
confused with the late director of the same name -- just finished a miniseries 
called "A Family of Spies" and a film, "Spooner," starring Robert Urich. Avery 
has performed in "Fletch," "8 Million Ways to Die," "L.A. Law," "St. Elsewhere" 
and "Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
When Avery and Wesley came back to town to see "Williams and Walker," they said 
it was like looking back in time at themselves. The co-stars of the show, El 
Amin and Damon Bryant, evidently agreed. They told Avery and Wesley after the 
show that they had been inspired to work in the theater because of seeing their 
work at Southeast and at the Southern California Black Repertory Company. That, 
according to Avery, made him feel that "There is a God." 
</P>
<P>
"That's essentially what our whole thing was, to let people know that there are 
arts in the community, and that they are for everyone. That was part of our 
dream and I hope it happens again." 
</P>
<P>
But it looks as if it will take fresh blood to do it because most of those who 
leave, don't come back. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't pay the rent if you can't work at your profession, and, if you're 
not white, you can't find the work in San Diego," Wesley said. "I'd love to 
come home to my community and be a part of helping those youngsters who don't 
have the opportunity to get into mainstream. I've been trying to come to San 
Diego since 1985. I auditioned for the Globe and the Gaslamp and the Playhouse, 
but I can't come back just to carry a spear." 
</P>
<P>
Most black artists who remain have other jobs that pay the rent. Wesley 
describes his mentor, director Gaffney, a professor of contemporary black art 
at UC San Diego, as the force that keeps what black theater there is breathing 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney is the one theaters such as the San Diego Repertory Theatre call on 
when they produce "The Colored Museum." Gaffney is the man the Southeast 
Community Theatre relies upon to direct its shows. And Gaffney is the man who 
nurtured talent such as Wesley, Avery, El-Amin, Briggs-Graves and 
Henson-Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that nurturing involves getting work for black actors. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time a black actor works in San Diego is if there's a specific 
part for a black actor -- which is unfortunate -- or if Dr. Gaffney is 
directing a show," El-Amin said. 
</P>
<P>
And part of it involves helping actors find a reason to pursue that work -- 
despite the inevitable rejections. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Gaffney made me love acting," Wesley said. "He was able to see qualities 
that I didn't even know I had and convinced me that I had potential and would 
have a future in this business. He taught me values. There is no black theater 
outside of Dr. Gaffney -- not a physical or a mental space. I'll love him 
forever for this." 
</P>
<P>
But, as Gaffney himself is the first to admit, he is getting tired after years 
of trying to develop black theater in San Diego. He just turned 59, and he has 
abandoned his original goal of founding a black theater company in favor of 
getting a black and multi-ethnic theater off the ground, possibly with Latino 
directors Jorge Huerta and William Virchis and progressive white director Steve 
Pearson, who is known for his San Diego Public Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I get frustrated because, every time you get actors who are trained at the 
professional level, they leave town because there's no opportunity here. Then 
you start again. It makes it very difficult to build a company," Gaffney said. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest frustration though is not having a technical staff that would 
allow you to come in and function as a director and not have to do everything 
else as you do in a community theater. I'm used to it, but I'm getting old for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Three professionally trained black actresses who remain in town express similar 
frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
Henson-Phillips said she remains only because her family lives here, but she 
still thinks about moving to Los Angeles, where she gets most of her acting 
jobs. Thompson stays because of her job at the Educational Cultural Complex. 
And Briggs-Graves is a senior producer at KPBS-TV with her own television show. 
</P>
<P>
All three, however, are working for change. Briggs-Graves and Thompson believe 
there is a black and/or multi-ethnic theater in San Diego's future and they are 
trying to make it happen. Henson-Phillips is working with script development at 
the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre, where she is assisting managing director, Kit 
Goldman, with Goldman's dream of producing "The Debutante," a retelling of the 
Pygmalion myth in black turn-of-the-century Philadelphia, as a starring vehicle 
for Cleavon Little. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman's commitment to "The Debutante" project, the Old Globe Theatre's 
success with playwright Wilson's "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" and "The Piano 
Lesson," the San Diego Repertory Theatre's success with "The Colored Museum," 
the La Jolla Playhouse's ongoing commitment to portraying the black experience 
in works like "Shout Up a Morning" and "Big River" and Starlight Musical 
Theatre's inclusion of "Dreamgirls" on the season schedule suggest to some that 
the times, they are a'changing. 
</P>
<P>
But Rufus DeWitt, managing director and one of the co-founders of the Southeast 
Community Theatre, cautiously contents himself with more modest indications of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
He points to the fact that theaters are now sending out audition notices to his 
organization asking for actors -- not just black actors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a change in the way they are opening the door to 
auditioners," DeWitt said. "I don't know if it's just lip service, but it is a 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman credits the flyaway success of the Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning 
Wilson and his exposure at the Old Globe as an impetus to address the black 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilson's helping to create a broad audience for plays that deal with black 
culture or history or subject matter. It's making it fashionable," Goldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hall, the Old Globe's managing director, said his theater has told 
Wilson that the Globe is interested in producing whatever he writes. Next year, 
the Globe hopes to have the new Wilson play on its boards, making that Wilson's 
third production here in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge to do theater here," Briggs-Graves said. "But most things 
that are worth having come with a challenge. If local theaters are wise, 
they'll see we have lot of middle class people who are thirsting for theater, 
music, jazz and art. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing for us to do is to seize the opportunity when it arrives. I 
hope that will be soon." 
</P>
<P>
El-Amin, for example, has no illusions about opportunities in San Diego. He has 
had more work in Minneapolis and New York than he has been offered in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
When he completes his master's degree in three years, it is still his dream to 
come home and assume the artistic leadership of the Southeast Community 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still talented people here yet to be discovered. I think they should 
have an artistic director who makes sure there is an ongoing season. I want to 
get my professional training and pursue my career, but this is my home. These 
are my roots. And I want to give something back." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the struggle for black playwrights, actors and directors to find a 
place in the San Diego sun continues. Who will produce the August Wilsons 
before they become August Wilson? Who will present the James Earl Joneses 
before they become James Earl Jones? 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Community Theatre is preparing for its 25th anniversary 
celebration in August by asking its alumni who left the city to come back and 
show solidarity with the organization.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO;

<P>
DRUMMER TONY WILLIAMS STICKS WITH RAW TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drummer Tony Williams is living proof that you don't have to forsake melodies 
or a beat to make a new musical statement. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who plays the City College Theater with his acoustic quintet at 8 
p.m. Monday in a show co-presented by KSDS-FM (88.3) and the San Diego Jazz 
Festival, uses his raw talent to create within the limits of straight-ahead 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
A child prodigy who was playing drums in Boston clubs with his saxophonist 
father before his teens, Williams went to New York to join Jackie McLean's band 
when he was only 16. With bassist Ron Carter and pianist Herbie Hancock, 
Williams completed the rhythm section that propelled trumpeter Miles Davis 
through such seminal '60s albums as "In a Silent Way," "Miles in the Sky" and 
"Miles Smiles," albums that marked the birth of the rock/jazz marriage known 
today as fusion. 
</P>
<P>
But it was when he left Davis in the late '60s that Williams began to find 
himself, melding elements of jazz and rock in a band called Tony Williams 
Lifetime with guitarist John McLaughlin and organist Larry Young. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' current band, together since 1985, is loaded with talent: pianist 
Mulgrew Miller, trumpeter Wallace Roney, sax man Billy Pierce and bassists Bob 
Hurst and Ira Coleman. Miller has been getting praise for his own debut solo 
album. 
</P>
<P>
With this band, Williams seems to have found an ideal setting. The music, 
composed by Williams, is powered by his crisp stick work: rapidly shifting 
layers of rhythms coming from carefully tuned drums that almost give his 
playing a melodic quality. His crisp rolls and deft cymbal work have become a 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
The drummer won't say much about the group, which recently released "Angel 
Street," its third album. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a band like this before. I like trying things that haven't been 
tried. . . . The music? I can't put it into words. If you could explain music, 
you wouldn't need music." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego marks the halfway point on the band's six-week tour of the United 
States and Canada. In August, they'll be playing jazz festivals in Japan. 
Tickets for the San Diego show are $12 ($14 at the door), available at all 
Ticketmaster locations or from the KSDS studios (234-1062). 
</P>
<P>
The show is the first of what KSDS and the Jazz Festival hope will be a series 
of jointly presented summer jazz concerts. Williams will be interviewed on KSDS 
at 3 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Henry Butler, who opened a three-week gig at Elario's last night, has 
most often been likened to pianist McCoy Tyner. But any similarities in their 
percussive attacks are more coincidence than the result of direct influences, 
Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, Butler's aggressive approach developed quite independently. He began 
his musical career as a grammar school drummer, which instilled strong rhythms, 
and he grew up in New Orleans, "which probably has more good drummers than any 
city its size in this country," he said. 'With that kind of environment, one 
almost had to be percussive." 
</P>
<P>
Butler counts pianist Keith Jarrett and saxophone giant John Coltrane among his 
influences. He has many talents beyond the piano: Besides singing and 
composing, he also takes pictures, all the more impressive because Butler is 
blind. "A moron can take a picture," he said. "A dog can do it if he knows 
which button to choose with his paw." Butler's photos, though, aren't dogs. 
They've been shown around the country to favorable reviews. 
</P>
<P>
In La Jolla, he'll be backed by San Diegans Jim Plank on drums and Bob 
Magnusson on bass. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the Centro Cultural in Tijuana, two groups of Southern 
California musicians will present "Homenaje a Charlie Parker," a memorial to 
the pioneering bebopper. One band includes local sax man Charles McPherson, 
one-time L.A. Express drummer John Guerin, pianist Frank Strazzeri and 
trumpeter Chuck Findley. The other consists of pianist Mel Goot, drummer Carlos 
Vasquez, percussionist Armando Rosas, bassist Bill Andrews, Mexican saxophone 
player Esteban Favela, San Diegan Bruce Cameron on trumpet and possibly Coral 
Thuet on vocals. Consider the event an early birthday party: Parker was born 
Aug. 29, 1920. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarists Al DiMeola and Larry Coryell electrified listeners with their fusion 
work in the '70s, DiMeola with Chick Corea in Return to Forever, Coryell 
leading his own bands, including The Eleventh House. Both are also prodigious 
talents on acoustic guitar. On June 21, they join hot young French guitarist 
Birelli Lagrene in a "Super Guitar Trio" at the Bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Animal Logic, the band put together by bassist Stanley Clarke and former 
Police drummer Stewart Copeland, hits the Bacchanal on Monday. . . . KSWV-FM 
(102.9), which, with the help of disc jockey Art Good (formerly of KIFM), stole 
the Catamaran's Cannibal Bar away from KIFM's Lites Out circuit for its own 
Jazz Nite, has added a second club to its promotional lineup: the Full Moon in 
Encinitas, which holds its "Moonlight Jazz" nights every Sunday. This week, the 
club features the Mark Lessman Band. The Wave thus beats KIFM to the punch with 
a club promotion in North County, ripe territory for light-jazz lovers. . . . 
Spencer Nilsen, whose "Architects of Change" album is a mainstay of local 
contemporary jazz stations, is considering recording an extended dance version 
of "Church on Wall St." from the album. . . . New Age band Shadowfax, which 
claims to have used more than 150 instruments from all over the world on its 
new album, "Folk Songs for a Nuclear Village," plays the Del Mar Fair at 7:30 
p.m. Sunday.

Authorities arrested the former chief of a federal police agency in the 1984 
slaying of a crusading newspaper columnist. Gunshots and tear gas were fired 
before he gave up, a domestic news service said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had issued a warrant Sunday for Jose Antonio Zorrilla's arrest in 
the fatal shooting of Manuel Buendia, who had been a vocal critic of corruption 
in government. 
</P>
<P>
Police exchanged gunfire with Zorrilla outside his home, and one officer was 
wounded, the Excelsior news service reported. Police called for reinforcements 
and soon more than 70 uniformed officers and about 50 vehicles surrounded the 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Local news reports said Dist. Atty. Ignacios Morales Lechuga arrived about half 
an hour later, and the men talked inside the residence before Zorrilla 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
Morales Lechuga said in a statement that he met with Zorrilla and drove him to 
Morales Lechuga's office, where he was arrested. He did not mention the gunfire 
and confrontation at Zorrilla's home. 
</P>
<P>
The government news agency Notimex said Juventino Prado, a commander with the 
Mexico City Police Department's intelligence division and a former lieutenant 
under Zorrilla, was hospitalized on Tuesday with a nervous breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators in the case, Prado accompanied Zorrilla when he 
arrived at the scene soon after the May 30, 1984, shooting, Notimex said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on television Monday night, Morales Lechuga had identified 
Buendia as the "intellectual author" of the Buendia slaying. Authorities have 
refused to comment on a possible motive. 
</P>
<P>
Buendia, a front-page columnist for the newspaper Excelsior and the author of 
several books that tackled sensitive targets like official corruption, drug and 
weapons trafficking and the CIA, was gunned down in a downtown parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
Zorrilla has long been suspected of concealing evidence and intimidating 
witnesses.

NORTH-SOUTH SPLIT FOLLOWS 'BOAT PEOPLE' TO HONG KONG

About 300 "boat people" from southern Vietnam pressed demands Wednesday for 
transfer to another camp, complaining of threats and attacks by refugees from 
the Communist heartland of northern Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of southerners left the Bowring refugee camp starting Monday and sat and 
slept outside the San Yick camp, where they asked to be let in. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Vietnamese at Bowring are northerners. Southerners make up the 
majority at San Yick, a converted factory that the international community 
condemned as unfit for human habitation until Hong Kong improved conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The group swelled to about 300 people Wednesday, and some carried all their 
belongings with them, a Corrections Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The southerners said northerners over the weekend had beaten a southern man who 
required hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
"They claimed they were threatened there," said the spokesman, who cannot be 
identified under agency regulations. "There are always disputes between 
northern and southern Vietnamese in the camp." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said department officials had tried to persuade the southerners 
to return to Bowring and apply for transfer through normal channels. 
</P>
<P>
Along with conflicts inside the camps, the government of this tiny British 
colony has had to contend with the increasing resentment of the Vietnamese by 
Hong Kong people, particularly those who live near the camps. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, more than 200 residents of the Yuen Long community protested 
government plans to open a detention center there for new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
The marching protesters blocked a road leading to the Sek Kong military 
airfield, 12 miles from central Hong Kong, where the government plans to erect 
of cluster of tents on the runway to house the Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>

EPA TO PUT CLEANUP BURDEN ON INDUSTRY 
</P>

Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly, responding to a deluge 
of criticism about the slow and costly progress of hazardous waste cleanup, 
pledged Wednesday to shift the focus of the nation's Superfund program to force 
industries to pay a greater share of cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
The turn to such adversarial tactics -- including use of a law requiring 
uncooperative polluters to pay triple the costs of the damage they cause -- 
comes as part of a full-scale EPA reassessment of Superfund, whose estimated 
cost has soared to $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In outlining the "mid-course correction" of the nine-year-old program, Reilly 
acknowledged that Superfund had proven inefficient in the past. But he argued 
that public expectations of rapid progress had often been unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a program on which the public will be embarked for a long time to 
come," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Faster Pace 
</P>
<P>
The agency's projected crackdown on industrial polluters is aimed at speeding 
the pace of hazardous waste cleanup without adding to the burden on taxpayers. 
The effort is to be bolstered by near-doubling of the Superfund enforcement 
staff, including a shift of 500 officials and $75 million previously allocated 
to other tasks within the program. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Justice Department official strongly endorsed the plan and said the 
department stood ready to "take additional aggressive action in the courts." 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses should simply not be allowed to avoid having to pay for the 
detritus they're spreading around," said Donald A. Carr, acting assistant 
attorney general for land and natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
The new "blueprint" for Superfund was intended as the agency's answer to more 
than 30 separate studies that have criticized the slow pace of hazardous waste 
cleanup under the program, which has been saddled with cost overruns and 
tainted by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List of Sites to Grow 
</P>
<P>
Of 1,200 sites on the agency's top priority list, only 26 have been totally 
cleaned up. And with scores of new sites identified each year, the 
high-priority list is expected to reach 2,100 by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Among the program's sharpest critics were members of the Senate Environment 
Committee, who demanded that Reilly reevaluate Superfund's course. The EPA 
chief is to formally present the plan to the panel's Superfund subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Its chairman, Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.), and another Superfund critic, 
Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.), both praised the EPA review for its 
willingness to acknowledge the failures of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that we finally have a team willing to get the Superfund program 
moving," Lautenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enforcement Tools' 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger added: "EPA needs to make more use of the powerful enforcement 
tools in Superfund to get recalcitrant industries to pay to clean up the 
pollution they have created." 
</P>
<P>
The agency has always sought to persuade polluting companies to pay the costs 
of hazardous waste cleanup. But it has tended first to use federal money to 
clean up the sites and only later to seek reimbursement. As a result, EPA's 
efforts to recover Superfund costs now lag far behind its expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
The agency had previously refrained from an "enforcement first" approach, 
warning that to rely on polluters might unwisely delay necessary cleanup 
efforts. But Reilly insisted Wednesday that if EPA were to demonstrate a 
willingness to penalize polluters aggressively, the threat would force 
companies to clean up hazardous waste sites promptly. 
</P>
<P>
"I really hope and expect that we're going to increase the pace of the 
cleanups," Reilly said.

TRIBUTE TO VETERANS COMES NEARLY 40 YEARS AFTER CONFLICT;

KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL DESIGN UNVEILED

In a White House ceremony as hot and humid as a rice paddy in July, Korean War 
veterans Wednesday saw the unveiling of the winning design for a memorial to 
their war of nearly 40 years ago -- a representation of a 38-man platoon 
advancing in battle column through trees. 
</P>
<P>
Mopping his brow, President Bush hailed the memorial as an overdue tribute to 
an "American victory," a term not usually associated with the conflict more 
frequently described as a stalemate in which a U.S. attempt to defeat Communist 
North Korea ended with the peninsula still divided. 
</P>
<P>
"We succeeded and built a stable peace that has lasted more than 35 years," 
Bush said. "In retrospect, the policy of containment so exemplified by the 
Korean conflict created the conditions for the tide toward democracy now 
changing and uplifting our globe." 
</P>
<P>
The presidential view of history was backed by retired Marine Gen. Raymond G. 
Davis, whose four rows of medals were topped with the starred blue ribbon of 
the Congressional Medal of Honor won in Korea for a heroic rescue mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people called it a draw," Davis told reporters after the ceremony. "But 
if you look at it as the salvaging of the freedom of a people which enabled 
them to become one of our foremost allies in that part of the world, in that 
sense it was a victory." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need $2.8 Million 
</P>
<P>
Retired Army Gen. Richard G. Stilwell, chairman of the memorial advisory board 
appointed to help the American Battle Monuments Commission carry out the 
$6-million project, pledged a "fast track" campaign to raise the $2.8 million 
still needed to complete construction by June 25, 1991, the 41st anniversary of 
North Korea's attack on the south. 
</P>
<P>
The $20,000-design competition winners, Don Leon, Eliza Oberholtzer, John Lucas 
and his wife, Veronica, all from Pennsylvania State University, said they were 
attempting to show the movement of a war that surged the length of the 
peninsula before its final entrenchment along the 38th Parallel, the original 
line of demarcation after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The 38 8-foot-high figures include a Korean porter and three "Katusas," members 
of the South Korean army who fought with U.S. units. At the point where the 
platoon would emerge from the trees into an open, sunken area, a retaining wall 
will honor the 33,629 killed in battle and depict the air, naval and 
noncombatant aspects of the war. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic design, chosen by a 10-member jury of Korean War veterans, will 
encompass about two acres in a grove of trees southeast of the Lincoln 
Memorial, directly across the reflecting pool from the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial.

GEPHARDT AIM: CHANGE FROM INSIDE SYSTEM

When Richard A. Gephardt was student body president at Northwestern University 
in 1962, student leaders spent weeks debating whether to boycott a local 
barbershop that charged blacks higher prices than whites. It finally came down 
to a vote, with Gephardt breaking an 11-11 tie to endorse the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
But as soon as students began picketing, Gephardt organized behind-the-scenes 
negotiations that led within a month to an agreement with the barber to end the 
discrimination. It was a move that was to prove prophetic for his future 
political career. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always believed," Gephardt said in an interview last year, "that what I 
try to do is to change the status quo where I think it needs changing -- but 
from inside the system." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Golden Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
Now Gephardt, who made a strong bid for the Democratic presidential nomination 
in 1988 on a populist, anti-Establishment platform, will have a golden 
opportunity to demonstrate his conciliatory abilities as the new House majority 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Gephardt is the ultimate consensus-oriented guy," says Rep. Robert T. 
Matsui (D-Sacramento). "He has strong beliefs, but he will work within the 
Democratic Party to build an agenda for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
After only 12 years in Congress, Gephardt, 48, is suddenly the No. 2 Democrat 
in the House under new Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). And with his Eagle 
Scout background and squeaky clean image, the Missouri Democrat was an 
overwhelmingly popular choice to help lead his party out of the firestorm of 
ethical controversy that brought down former Speaker Jim Wright and Rep. Tony 
Coehlo of Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
"He has weathered the scrutiny and investigation of the presidential campaign, 
and comes to this with very excellent credentials in terms of honesty and 
integrity," said Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Makes Career Choice 
</P>
<P>
To become majority leader, Gephardt is setting aside his presidential ambitions 
at least until 1996 and perhaps forever. Richard Moe, a Gephardt adviser during 
his campaign, believes that Gephardt is now destined to become the top Democrat 
in the House some day rather than a future Democratic standard bearer for 
President. "In making this decision," Moe said, "I think it's apparent that 
he's made a basic career choice." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt, who was 35 years old when he was first elected to the House, is the 
very model of today's television-age politician. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes derided for his perfectly blow-dried strawberry blond hair and for 
backing away from his original positions on abortion and tax reform when it 
seemed politically expedient, he reminded some observers during last year's 
presidential primary campaign of Robert Redford in "The Candidate," a movie 
that attacked modern political campaigning as a con game. 
</P>
<P>
But Gephardt, his friends say, is no shallow front man for behind-the-scenes 
manipulators. He has not backed away, for instance, from his controversial 
support for tough -- sometimes protectionist -- trade measures against foreign 
countries. "It was his willingness to fly in the face of conventional, elite 
opinions that made him a major contender," said William Carrick, Gephardt's 
former campaign manager. "When things looked bleakest in Iowa, he simply 
decided to campaign on the gut issues he really believed in." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt is generally considered a middle-of-the-road Democrat in the House, 
but he plans to urge the party to define its positions more bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to cook pablum. It's harder to cook Cajun stew," he told his 
Democratic colleagues Wednesday after being elected to the leadership post. "We 
have to have a consensus with an edge. . . . We must be willing to say where we 
stand in clear, unequivocal language." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked on Budget Law 
</P>
<P>
But Gephardt's forte is expected to be as an institutional insider working to 
forge legislative compromises, as he did in particular during the 1985 battles 
to pass the Gramm-Rudman budget law. 
</P>
<P>
"He can disagree and not be disagreeable," said Rep. Ike Skelton, a fellow 
Democrat from Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans are worried that he may prove to be a particularly formidable 
opponent. "Gephardt is pretty well liked on the Republican side of the aisle, 
but he is certainly more of a hardball player than Tom Foley is," said Rep. 
Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.). "He tends to be a polarizer rather than a conciliator 
between the parties." 
</P>
<P>
For Democrats, Gephardt's elevation marks an important changing of the guard in 
Washington. "He's the first of the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate representatives 
to rise to such a high leadership post," said Rep. Leon E. Panetta 
(D-Monterey). "It's a new generation that is much more independent and much 
more issue-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
For all his up-to-date image, however, Gephardt was remarkably unaffected by 
the social upheavals of the 1960s. When some other Democratic candidates and 
several younger GOP lawmakers acknowledged using marijuana during the 
controversy over Supreme Court nominee Douglas H. Ginsburg, for example, 
Gephardt confessed to never having touched the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Married to the former Jane Byrnes, with three children, Gephardt himself even 
joked sometimes that his "Dick and Jane" life seemed to be something out of an 
old-fashioned elementary school reader. 
</P>
<P>
But given the mood on Capitol Hill, Gephardt is likely to prove well-suited to 
an era when every step a politician takes will be examined closely. "A lot of 
politicians don't wear well," said Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.). "He wears better 
with every meeting."

Cigarettes with low levels of tar and nicotine do not protect female smokers 
from the risk of heart attack, researchers at the Boston University School of 
Medicine reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-year study of more than 3,000 female smokers and nonsmokers, the 
investigators discovered that smokers were four times more likely to have a 
heart attack than nonsmokers and that smoking "safer" cigarettes did not make a 
difference in the heart attack rate. 
</P>
<P>
A 1983 study found the same results in men. 
</P>
<P>
The new study of women under 65, which appears in the current issue of the New 
England Journal of Medicine, comes at a time when the tobacco industry is using 
"advertising campaigns that imply that some cigarettes -- 'low yield brands' -- 
are safe, or safer than others," the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"What these findings mean for smokers, at least as they relate to heart 
disease, is that there is no advantage to switching brands," said Julie Palmer, 
an epidemiologist and chief author of the study.

FBI EXTENDS ITS INSPECTION OF ROCKY FLATS ARMS PLANT

Federal investigators extended their search of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons 
facility for 10 days longer and established a special telephone line to receive 
scores of tips flooding in from whistle-blowers, angry neighbors and other 
concerned citizens, the FBI said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The search warrant was being renewed because "the size and number of documents 
involved make this a very voluminous, monstrous operation," Bob Pence, special 
agent-in-charge of the FBI in Colorado, said. 
</P>
<P>
Additional agents from both the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency 
have been brought in "from around the country" to help look for evidence of 
environmental crimes allegedly committed at the plant 16 miles northwest of 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Pence said the Department of Energy and its Rocky Flats contractor, Rockwell 
International Corp., were cooperating in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Energy Department and Rockwell are suspected of illegal dumping, 
burning of hazardous wastes and falsifying documents. 
</P>
<P>
Agents in special protective clothing have been posted around the clock at the 
plant, which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, since a 
massive raid was mounted there nine days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pence said that the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency have received 
well over 100 calls from people offering new information about suspected 
wrongdoing at the plant, Pence said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of it seems to be pretty significant," he said, but he would not discuss 
any of the tips in detail.

Setting up a crucial turn in the 11-year legal battle over Mono Lake water, 
National Audubon Society and Los Angeles attorneys Wednesday argued very 
different scenarios of the threat the city's growing thirst poses to the 
picturesque but shrinking Eastern Sierra salt lake.

The Audubon Society asked that Los Angeles be stopped from taking any more Mono 
Lake stream water this year, arguing that the lake is close to again falling 
below a critical level needed to protect California gull nests from coyotes and 
other predators. The conservation group's stance was backed by the Mono Lake 
Committee, an activist group that favors protecting the lake, and the U.S. 
Forest Service, which administers a scenic area established by Congress around 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
But, in an all-day confrontation in a South Lake Tahoe courtroom, attorneys for 
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said the threat is overstated and 
argued that the 16% of the Los Angeles water supply that is shipped south from 
Mono Basin must continue to flow. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado County Superior Court Judge Terrence M. Finney did not immediately 
rule on the preliminary injunction sought Wednesday by the Audubon Society, 
which first sued Los Angeles in May, 1979, over environmental damage from the 
city's diversion of streams that historically filled Mono Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles lost a crucial round in that case when the California Supreme Court 
ruled last year that the lawsuit was valid. Finney has been selected to preside 
over a trial next year in that suit and two others that seeking to protect fish 
in streams that flow down from the High Sierra and into Mono Lake, which is too 
saline to support fish but is a major nesting area for California gulls and a 
stopover for migrating birds, all of which feed on brine shrimp and brine 
flies. 
</P>
<P>
Finney's decision on the preliminary injunction -- expected within 30 days -- 
will set ground rules to be used until that trial is held. It will, in effect, 
decide for now if the lake can fall below a level that will uncover a land 
connection to islands where the gulls nest. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s and early '80s, when the lake level plunged, the land bridge 
was exposed and coyotes were able to reach Negit Island. The nesting gull 
colony was nearly destroyed, Audubon attorney F. Bruce Dodge said. 
</P>
<P>
If the city is allowed to divert its usual amount south this year -- the third 
straight year of lower-than-normal snowfall in the Eastern Sierra -- the 
connection to Negit Island will be exposed again. The lower lake level will 
also expose more of the lake bed to windstorms and lead to a worsening of the 
dust cloud problem that has plagued the Mono Basin and Owens Valley areas in 
recent years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodge said the lake is currently less than two feet above the water level 
needed to keep coyotes off Negit Island. If the preliminary injunction is 
denied and Los Angeles continues to export Mono Basin water this summer, he 
said, "it is undeniable that Negit Island will be connected to the mainland." 
</P>
<P>
Dodge and attorney Patrick Flinn also argued that Los Angeles water use has 
grown in recent years by much more than the amount needed this year to protect 
Mono Lake, and said that the city can easily replace the water if it chooses 
through its unused entitlement to large amounts of water delivered to Southern 
California from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta by the Metropolitan Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
However, attorney Adolph Moskovitz, representing the DWP, said that the lower 
water level does not pose the "irreparable harm" required before the city can 
be denied its right to export water. 
</P>
<P>
He unveiled a proposal by the city to lower the lake level four to six feet in 
order to study the effect on the lake's ecosystem. Moskovitz said the lake 
dropped that far in recent years without irreversible damage, but that 
scientists did not take advantage of the drop to study how able the lake's 
ecosystem is to endure stresses. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' right to take water from Mono Lake streams is also under threat in 
another lawsuit.

An appearance before the state Supreme Court caused momentary embarrassment for 
an embarrassing note for an Orange County prosecutor Wednesday. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Thomas J. Borris, arguing in a drug-related death case, at one point 
addressed the justices as "you guys." 
</P>
<P>
"When you say, 'you guys,' to whom are you referring?" Chief Justice Malcolm M. 
Lucas asked icily.

Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the lone woman on the court, asked, "Does that 
include me?"

The prosecutor quickly apologized and the court returned to the issues at hand.

The Sierra Club and a grass-roots environmental group filed a lawsuit Wednesday 
alleging that hazardous-waste management plans pushed by the state will turn 
rural, farming counties into dumping grounds for urban toxic wastes and 
industrial poisons. 
</P>
<P>
The Tulare County Superior Court suit said Tulare County supervisors violated 
the California Environmental Quality Act in approving a hazardous-waste 
management plan on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Bob Wright, who filed the suit in Visalia on behalf of Visalia-based 
Citizens for a Healthy Environment and the Sierra Club, said agricultural 
Tulare County could be turned into a "dumping ground" for toxic wastes from the 
Silicon Valley and Los Angeles. He said such wastes should be taken to remote 
desert areas, not farming communities where ground-water protection is vital. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see the urban areas dump on us," said Marcie Williams, 
president of Citizens for a Healthy Environment. She said two hazardous-waste 
companies now want to build disposal sites in her county and others may follow. 
</P>
<P>
At the core of the lawsuit is a dispute over "fair share" language in the 
county's hazardous-waste management plan regarding how much toxic waste 
smaller, rural counties can be required to take from big, urban counties. 
</P>
<P>
Tulare County supervisors adopted "fair share" language pushed by the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
The County Supervisors Assn. of California has proposed alternative "fair 
share" language supported by 42 of the state's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Milligan, legislative analyst for the supervisors association, said her 
group's language gives county governments more control in determining whether 
hazardous waste dumps are built in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
Tulare County and adjacent Kings County are the only counties supporting the 
state's "fair share" language. However, Health Services Department officials 
have vowed to veto any "fair share" language proposed by the supervisors' 
association. 
</P>
<P>
Under recent legislation by Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-El Monte), all of the 
counties in the state must develop hazardous-waste management plans and most of 
them must be submitted by September.

LUPUS SUPPORT GROUPS ASK STATE PROBE OF BANE'S FOUNDATION, ALLOCATION OF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of lupus support groups asked the state attorney general Wednesday 
to investigate a nonprofit lupus foundation headed by Assemblyman Tom Bane 
(D-Tarzana) and a series of allocations of public funds by a state lupus 
research board headed by Bane's wife. 
</P>
<P>
The groups questioned the state board's allocation of $800,000 to a physician 
friend of the Banes and claimed, in a letter to Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, 
that the research "contracted for by the state was simply not done, unless it 
was done so badly that it was not publishable." 
</P>
<P>
The concern was contained in a letter from Dr. Daniel J. Wallace, a medical 
adviser to the American Lupus Society's Southern California chapters and the 
Lupus Foundation of America, the two largest lupus organizations in the nation. 
Nancy G. Horn, president of the Greater Los Angeles Chapter of the Lupus 
Foundation of America, also wrote a letter to Van de Kamp requesting an 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of both letters were provided to The Times but had not reached the 
attorney general's office late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Things don't add up," Horn said in an interview. "Funds were not where they 
should be. I just want an accounting. And I think Tom Bane should be made 
accountable." 
</P>
<P>
Bane did not respond to an interview request Wednesday. In the past, he has 
maintained that he and his wife have done nothing improper in the way they have 
championed research on lupus, a debilitating and potentially fatal autoimmune 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
The lupus organizations' letters are the latest chapter in a controversy 
involving Bane and the three-member state Lupus Appropriations Board headed by 
Marlene Bane. The board has dispensed $6.2 million in state funds to scientists 
since 1977 to do Lupus research. 
</P>
<P>
Bane angered the lupus support groups when he agreed earlier this year to end 
the board's funding, apparently because he was upset that the state Department 
of Health Services had determined that some of the panel's decisions raised 
questions of fairness and favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Van de Kamp, Wallace questioned $801,473 in lupus board grants 
for research by Dr. Raymond L. Teplitz, a longtime friend of the Banes and a 
contributor to the assemblyman's campaign committee. Teplitz received most of 
the money while he was at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte; 
he transferred to UC Davis in mid-1985. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, a Los Angeles rheumatologist and co-author of a recent lupus text, 
said an index of medical publications listed four articles by Teplitz on lupus 
since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Their contributions to lupus were marginal and they appeared in obscure 
journals," Wallace said, citing findings by the Lupus Foundation of America's 
Medical Advisory Board. Further, he said the board "estimates that at most, 
about $20,000 could have been spent on the work that was published." 
</P>
<P>
He asked Van de Kamp to audit Teplitz's files "to see if state monies were 
properly used." 
</P>
<P>
Teplitz, who previously declined to discuss his research with The Times, could 
not be reached Wednesday. Bane has said Teplitz did "real good work on testing 
whether people have lupus." 
</P>
<P>
Bane is also the volunteer chairman of the National Lupus Erythematosus 
Foundation, which was founded in 1957 to promote lupus research and fund lupus 
clinics.

COUNTY REJECTS PARAMEDIC PLAN FOR CLAREMONT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials expressed anger and frustration, but not surprise, this week 
when the county Board of Supervisors rejected a proposal that would have ended 
a longstanding feud over paramedic service. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted Tuesday against a recommendation by the county Emergency 
Medical Services Commission to allow Claremont to have a private firm provide 
its paramedic service. The privatization of paramedic service, which would have 
set a precedent for the 47 communities that belong to the county Fire 
Protection District, was opposed by the Fire Department and the county's chief 
administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Michael Freeman told supervisors that the idea of mixing private 
paramedic service with county fire protection flies in the face of the 
district's policies and would make the handling of emergencies chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
"It would violate the unity of command," Freeman said. "We would have fire 
personnel in charge of fire protection and we would have a private paramedic 
provider in charge of emergency medical treatment. . . . We would rather see 
the city withdraw completely from the district than have this fragmentation of 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Works Elsewhere' 
</P>
<P>
Claremont City Manager Glenn Southard said cities with their own fire 
departments have successfully integrated private paramedic firms into their 
emergency response systems. 
</P>
<P>
"It works elsewhere," Southard said. County fire officials "just don't want to 
give up the control. It's not an efficiency question. In fact, I would argue 
that the private sector may be more efficient. . . . It's just power politics. 
It's a shame they're playing with our citizens' lives." 
</P>
<P>
Southard said Tuesday's decision by the Board of Supervisors may lead Claremont 
to withdraw from the fire protection district, of which it has been a member 
since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to look at whether we want to stay in the fire district," he said. 
"They don't seem interested in being our fire department." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feuding Since 1987 
</P>
<P>
The city has been at odds with the Fire Department since October, 1987, because 
Claremont is the only city in the eastern San Gabriel Valley without a 
paramedic unit. When paramedics are needed in Claremont, they must be summoned 
from San Dimas, Glendora or Azusa. As a result, response times in Claremont 
average more than 10 minutes, and have exceeded 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have offered to locate a paramedic squad in Claremont, but 
only if the city would pay for the increased service by giving the county an 
estimated $79,000 in property tax revenue from a downtown redevelopment project 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The county currently receives $118,000 a year from other redevelopment areas in 
Claremont, said Assistant City Manager Bridget Distelrath. City leaders, 
arguing that Claremont is receiving substandard service, initially balked at 
the increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Contract 
</P>
<P>
After negotiations with the county appeared to reach a stalemate earlier this 
year, Claremont officials contracted with Medic-1, a San Dimas-based ambulance 
company, to provide paramedic service. However, the Fire Department refused to 
give its approval, as required under state law before the firm could begin 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The city took its case to the Emergency Medical Services Commission, which 
voted in March to recommend that the Board of Supervisors permit Medic-1 to 
operate alongside county firefighters in the city for a one-year trial period. 
</P>
<P>
Southard said this arrangement would provide vitally needed paramedic service 
for residents while the city and county work out their differences. The city 
also offered to provide the county with the additional tax revenue for up to 
two years or until a permanent solution could be found. 
</P>
<P>
But Schabarum said Tuesday that the commission's recommendation "is not timely 
and would delay resolution of this matter." 
</P>
<P>
"The city, while willing to enter into an interim agreement and willing to pay 
the increment for a couple of years, does not provide the fire district with 
the . . . comfort that (a permanent) agreement will (be reached) two years from 
now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana concurred, advising the city to take the fire district up 
on its offer. "It just seems to me that for $79,000, the city of Claremont 
should just sign up for this and have the fire protection district provide the 
service on a long-term basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditions Attached 
</P>
<P>
But Claremont officials, noting that the tax increment revenue lost by the city 
would run into millions of dollars over the 28-year life of the redevelopment 
project, say they will only reach a long-term agreement under certain 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The city is demanding that paramedic response times be monitored annually and 
that the county place a second emergency medical team in Claremont if the 
average response time exceeds five minutes. Claremont officials also want an 
escape clause from the agreement, which could cover a period as long as 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never said that we want something we're not willing to pay for," Mayor 
Alex Hughes said. "What we have said is, 'Since we're going to have to pay for 
it, we want certain things.' I don't think performance standards are all that 
much to ask for." 
</P>
<P>
But Freeman said the city's insistence on performance standards was the main 
stumbling block to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Sought 
</P>
<P>
"While (a five-minute response) would be our objective, our concern is not 
committing to anything that's unworkable or anything that's any different than 
(the service received by) any other city in the district," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to resolve the matter, Schabarum directed the Fire Department to 
prepare a report assessing Claremont's paramedic needs and looking at response 
time. Schabarum also asked the Fire Department to tell the city of its plans to 
relocate the Padua Hills fire station, which is scheduled to be closed in 
January because it does not meet seismic safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum called for a report on the cost to the county of providing fire and 
paramedic service in Claremont. However, city officials also want the county to 
provide figures on the tax contributions of other cities in the fire protection 
district and the cost of the service they receive. The county has refused. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Enormous Task' 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum said the compilation of financial information for the 46 other 
communities in the district would be "an enormous task, one that does not serve 
the district at all." 
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with this response, the city plans to hire an independent 
consultant who will try to ferret the information out of the county 
bureaucracy, Southard said. The city expects the consultant's report to be 
finished by the end of the year, he said. This will determine whether Claremont 
will continue to contract for county fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
But for the time being, the city and county remain far apart and paramedics 
remain far away from many Claremont residents. Officials on both sides are 
frustrated by the lack of progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad, sad litany of failure to arrive at any kind of a conclusion," 
Schabarum said. "It's reached a point where it's an embarrassment to me, and I 
hope it is for the council as well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'What's the Problem?' 
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing both sides state their arguments, Supervisor Ed Edelman expressed 
amazement that the controversy was still simmering. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the problem?" Edelman said. "Why don't you guys get in a room and 
negotiate this thing and get it resolved?" 
</P>
<P>
However, Southard said, the matter is not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like it's a fresh idea: 'Why don't we sit down and negotiate,' " 
Southard said. "We've been doing this for 20 months. I can't even tell you how 
many meetings we've had. We've tried every option to resolve this. I think the 
ball's in the county's court as far as what they're going to provide. We can't 
waste any more time. Our citizens need a solution."

LIMITED WARFARE; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN IF THEY DID GIVE A BATTLE AND NO ENEMY CAME, IT WAS AWESOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An attack was expected at any minute, but the enemy was having problems getting 
its missiles off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 miles off the Ventura coast, a U.S. Navy battle group of five 
ships waited for the chance to blast the incoming missiles out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
And waited. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had hoped to provide a rare public view of what goes on at the 
Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu as well as a display of Navy 
firepower. 
</P>
<P>
But the plans went awry back at the launchpad. In a sense, it was as if the 
Navy had given a war and nobody came. 
</P>
<P>
The military dramatics began just after dawn on Tuesday when the commanding 
officer of the Pacific Missile Test Center, Rear Adm. G. H. Strohsahi Jr. told 
a room of reporters they soon would be in the middle of the coming action. 
</P>
<P>
As the press munched on doughnuts, Strohsahi announced that they would be flown 
by helicopter to the Antietam, one of the nation's newest guided missile 
cruisers, for a rare glimpse of a Navy war game. 
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose today is to give you a chance to see the real Navy in action," 
Strohsahi said. "The Antietam is in the middle of a war right now. You're going 
to go out and see four hours of that war." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's readiness exercise had begun Saturday. On this Tuesday, the Antietam 
was preparing to try to knock two incoming missiles out of the air before they 
reached the ship from their launch pad on San Nicolas Island. 
</P>
<P>
But the enemy attack never got off the ground. While the Navy was preparing to 
blast the daylights out of any "enemy" missiles aimed at the Antietam, there 
was an unexplained breakdown at the launch site. 
</P>
<P>
An aging Navy H-46 Sea Knight transport helicopter had already delivered the 
Antietam's visitors to the expected battle site, and the ship's commanding 
officer, Capt. Larry E. Eddingfield, had delivered his welcome speech when the 
launch problems were first reported. 
</P>
<P>
At first, there was talk of a brief delay. Then there was talk of a long delay. 
Finally, there was a decision to scrub the public missile deal altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"Things break," Eddingfield commented. 
</P>
<P>
One immediate consolation as reporters proceeded with a scheduled tour of the 
Antietam was the rather obvious conclusion to be drawn that it would have been 
a pretty lopsided war in any event. 
</P>
<P>
Heading to the bow of the missile cruiser, Lt. Cmdr. Lanny King, the ship's 
combat systems officer, first pointed out the Antietam's missile launching 
system, capable of firing a mix of 122 Standard, Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles 
with nuclear capability if deemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Then King showed off the rest of the ship, including the sophisticated AN/SPY 
1A radar system that makes the Antietam and other AEGIS missile cruisers the 
most electronically advanced surface battleships in the U.S. fleet, virtual 
floating radar shields for the battleships and aircraft carriers they were 
designed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Antietam's formidable defenses, the Navy had been planning to 
launch two of its antique and unarmed Talos missiles, once part of the nation's 
military arsenal but now useful only as expendable targets for high-tech Navy 
firing practice. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Antietam's officers pointed out that the Talos missiles 
occasionally never got close enough to a cruiser to get shot down anyway, 
sometimes barely making it off the ground before sputtering into a quick form 
of missile suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Pausing on the bridge of the Antietam, King said the momentary launch failure 
was not too upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed but there will be plenty of chances in the future to test 
ourselves," he said. "This would have been my 86th shot, so I think I can 
afford to miss this one." 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of a missile blasting out of the 30-foot mini-silos built into the 
Antietam's deck, reporters were given the chance to watch the ship fire some 
5-inch shells from a front gun position and a demonstration of a modernized 
Gatling gun known as CIWS, for Close In Weapons System, capable of firing 3,000 
rounds a minute at approaching targets. 
</P>
<P>
Then the helicopter returned and it was time for the Antietam's visitors to 
return to shore. Navy spokesmen shrugged off the minor glitch of the day and 
said plans call for more public glimpses of the Navy in action in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Antietam, one of two missile cruisers escorting the battleship 
New Jersey on this particular readiness exercise, continued to prowl the 
coastline, waiting for the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Soon enough, the enemy would figure out how to get its missiles launched. 
</P>
<P>
And the Antietam would be there, waiting.

OXNARD TEACHERS VOTE TO STRIKE IF NEGOTIATIONS FAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that took even union representatives by surprise, more than 200 
Oxnard elementary and intermediate school teachers took an informal vote to 
strike this fall if teachers and administrators fail to reach an agreement on 
salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
All 496 teachers in the district will vote on the issue in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The vote took place at Oxnard's Driffel Elementary School on Tuesday at a 
meeting called by the Oxnard Educators Assn. to explain salary negotiations to 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the association, which represents the city's 496 elementary and 
junior high school teachers, have been negotiating with Oxnard Elementary 
School District officials for pay increases. The teachers' contract with the 
district expires in June, 1990, but agreement has yet to be reached on 
increases for the present fiscal year or the 1989-90 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the impasse, the teachers at Tuesday's meeting voted almost 
unanimously to strike in September or October should the majority of the 
district's teachers agree. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Wondoloski, the teacher who made the motion, said it was time that the 
teachers fought back. 
</P>
<P>
"This community is behind us; they're on our side," said Wondoloski, a physical 
education teacher at Fremont Intermediate School. "They're tired of us being 
ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
Wondoloski's comments brought resounding applause. 
</P>
<P>
After the surprise vote, many of the teachers walked down the street to the 
administrative offices of the school district, then walked through the offices 
chanting and blowing whistles. The offices of many of the administrators 
involved in the contract negotiations, including Supt. Norm Brekke, are in the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Oxnard Education Assn. board member Mark Prim said he was 
happy with the teachers' decision. Prim, chairman of the teachers' bargaining 
team, said the district's offer of a 7% salary increase for the 1989-90 fiscal 
year and a 6.5% increase for 1990-91 was unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers don't want to strike, but an inflexible administration may force them 
to do so, Prim said. He said Tuesday's impromptu vote illustrated the teachers' 
solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a small group of militants as the district contends," Prim said. 
"This is definitely a vote of confidence for our position." 
</P>
<P>
Although Tuesday's vote was, in essence, only a vote to hold a districtwide 
vote, Prim said he has no doubt that the majority of the district's teachers 
will vote to strike. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll pass," Prim said. "This was solid support. . . . There are people that 
are real angry about this." 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Education Assn. has sent a letter to state mediator Draza Mrvichin 
requesting certification for fact-finding. Implemented when two sides fail to 
reach an agreement, fact-finding brings in an independent third party to review 
the issues and make a report. District officials oppose this step, saying it 
will only lengthen negotiations that already have lasted a year. 
</P>
<P>
Brekke questioned the legality of the proposed strike. According to Brekke, the 
teachers' existing contract has a clause that makes striking illegal. Brekke 
also questioned the wisdom of a strike when "the potential for further 
discussion and some agreements are there." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if the union is seriously interested in sitting down, there is 
the potential, in my judgment, for a resolution," he said. "Our differences are 
not so great." 
</P>
<P>
Prim acknowledged that a strike would violate the contract but said "the 
district has already broken that contract so many times by their unilateral 
actions . . . that they have made it almost insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers have filed 11 unfair labor practice charges against the district, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Prim said the union will abide by state collective-bargaining procedures and 
will refrain from striking until the fact-finding process is concluded.

VENTURA OKS MODERATE GROWTH TO 115,000 BY 2010 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vision of Ventura in 2010 that has emerged from two weeks of marathon 
late-night hearings by the Ventura City Council is not all that different from 
the Ventura of today -- just bigger by about 21,000 people, with more hillside 
homes and less development in the flatlands. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of tough choices pitting environmentalists and no-growth advocates 
against land developers and most of the business community, the council made 
some concessions to both sides while holding a political middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
The council formally adopted a moderate growth plan that would permit a 
population of 115,000 by the year 2010, contingent on the availability of extra 
water and other resources needed to make such a population viable. 
</P>
<P>
To keep population growth at a steady pace, the council set an interim limit of 
105,000 for the year 2000, an increase of 11,000 people over the city's 
anticipated population of 94,000 by next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smaller Goal 
</P>
<P>
In the event that the city cannot obtain more water, the council also agreed on 
a smaller population goal of 102,000 over the next decade -- a rate of about 
900 new residents annually that is roughly half the growth rate of the last 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The council's actions followed prolonged public debate over population options 
presented by the Ventura Planning Commission. Those options ranged from 102,000 
to 147,000 by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the council's growth hearings -- spread over a two-week period -- 
included a vote against developing almost 1,000 acres of farmland in East 
Ventura for housing tracts that could eventually hold up to 12,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
While that was a victory for residents urging protection of Ventura's 
inner-city greenbelt, the council rejected the arguments of environmentalists 
on another key issue -- the rezoning of 500 acres of Taylor Ranch hillside to 
pave the way for a new California State University campus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Tightrope 
</P>
<P>
Other decisions by the council as it walked a political tightrope on the city's 
controversial growth issue included a vote against developers in further 
expansion of the Ventura Harbor area, a vote encouraging some future "upscale" 
hillside growth and a vote for "affordable" housing units in East Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the council continued its deliberations, council members themselves 
were divided on whether their actions could be viewed as an endorsement of 
either pro-growth or no-growth philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a moderate no-growth vote," said Councilman Richard Francis, who 
unsuccessfully tried to limit population to 112,000 by 2010. "It's a pretty 
good result of seven concerned people having to deal with a lot of tough 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
"I would consider it to be more pro-growth than not," countered Mayor Jim 
Monahan, who had favored a larger population goal of 122,000 by 2010 and 
consistently voted for more development. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan, the only council member to vote for development of the inner-city 
greenbelt, said he was particularly concerned about the council's veto of 
future development on the city's farmlands in East Ventura and near Ventura 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"The farmers were the first to lose," Monahan said. "Most Venturans will be the 
next. I'm sorry we took the action against further development of the harbor. I 
think there were going to be a lot of nice facilities built there. Some kind of 
a community center. Maybe a theater." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John McWherter, who had joined Francis in favoring a 112,000 
population limit, called the series of growth votes a "good compromise" that he 
views as politically acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Many People' 
</P>
<P>
"This provides for a growth rate almost half of what we've been experiencing," 
McWherter said. "If we can keep it at that, we won't be in too much trouble. 
It's still too many people in my view. But some people don't know we had a 
study here once back in 1964 that said we had enough room in Ventura between 
the hills and the ocean for 250,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
As the council began its deliberations last week after a series of late-night 
public hearings, the first key vote was against a coalition of local farmers 
and developers favoring development in the city's East End greenbelt area. 
</P>
<P>
"I have listened to a great number of speakers say the land isn't farmable," 
said Francis, who introduced the motion to preserve the greenbelt. "We have 20 
feet of topsoil, three crops a year and some of the best farmland in the 
nation. It's an extremely productive area." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the council's greenbelt vote, Rex. S. Laird, executive director of 
the Ventura County Farm Bureau, said he was "extremely disappointed" and 
accused council members of taking a cavalier attitude toward farmers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No True Recognition' 
</P>
<P>
"They speak of it as any other industry, but they don't ask any other industry 
to serve a separate function for the city such as providing open spaces," Laird 
said. "There is no true recognition by the council of what they're doing to 
those people directly involved." 
</P>
<P>
Also critical of the council's vote was Carolyn Leavens, a Ventura rancher with 
about 114 acres in the greenbelt area. Leavens said she plans to pursue 
negotiations with the council to improve conditions for those farmers who have 
been told, in effect, to remain in business or sell their land to other 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's right-to-farm legislation in other areas which spells out the rights 
and obligations of farmers," she said. "I just want the city to understand that 
we need to have the ability to farm without harassment and without a tremendous 
amount of neighbor blight." 
</P>
<P>
One immediate need of agricultural interests in Ventura, she said, is an 
ordinance permitting farmers to use aerial spraying of their crops. She said 
that practice has effectively been stopped by complaints from Ventura residents 
to the Federal Aviation Administration about low-flying planes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Costs 
</P>
<P>
"Our neighbors get frightened by air spraying of mineral fertilizers and they 
have called the FAA," Leavens said. "If we try to do it on the ground, it 
increases our costs. This is one of the areas we need help in. We need help in 
stopping vandals and others who systematically steal our fruit. Lemon fights 
have been something fun to do in Ventura for years. That attitude should be 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
While voting against extra growth in the greenbelt area, the council put growth 
concerns aside in unanimously approving the idea of a new Cal State campus on 
the slopes of the Taylor Ranch at the city's northern edge, deciding that the 
education needs of Ventura residents outweigh environmental objections to the 
proposed college site. 
</P>
<P>
That also brought criticism, this time from environmentalists. Paul Tebbel, an 
environmental spokesman for Patagonia Inc. of Ventura, called the council 
action a "major step" for Cal State in its efforts to acquire 500 acres of 
Taylor Ranch hillside from its owners by eminent domain if necessary to secure 
a future university site. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have stopped it right here," Tebbel said. "They have the power to 
withhold approval of sewer and water service, but they just reacted to the 
pressure to have a university in town."

MONTEBELLO SCHOOLS HAD 23% DROPOUT RATE IN 1988 CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new study of dropout rates released this month shows that more than one in 
five high school students in the Montebello Unified School District's class of 
1988 failed to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is serious," school administrator Charles W. Norton told the Board of 
Education as he revealed results of the district's most comprehensive study of 
high school dropout rates. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to come up with some solutions to bring these figures down," he said 
during a presentation that included a variety of recommendations for 
identifying and counseling students who are at risk of dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
Norton, however, stressed in a telephone interview later that other studies 
show that Montebello Unified is doing better than other districts in retaining 
students, and the dropout rates noted by all studies are below the county 
average. 
</P>
<P>
The 31,787-student school district, the third largest in Los Angeles County, 
covers Montebello, Bell Gardens, Commerce and parts of Downey, East Los 
Angeles, Monterey Park, Pico Rivera, Rosemead and South San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
In the new study, school officials tracked 2,324 students at Montebello, Schurr 
and Bell Gardens high schools from enrollment as 10th-graders in 1985 to 
graduation in 1988, said Norton, who headed the effort. 
</P>
<P>
The study was the first in which district officials tracked a specific group of 
students through the last three years of high school. It lists students who 
graduated, dropped out, transferred to other schools or entered alternative 
education programs, Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 23% of students in the class of 1988 dropped out, according to the 
survey. Bell Gardens High, which has a higher percentage of low-income Latino 
students, had the highest dropout rate -- 27.32%. Montebello High's dropout 
rate was 20.7%, and Schurr High's rate was 20.32%. 
</P>
<P>
Previous dropout studies, which have been used by district and state education 
officials, calculated district dropout rates that were as much as 16 percentage 
points below those in the recent study, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The district normally determines its dropout rate by comparing enrollment in 
early May with enrollment the following October, Norton said. Although student 
transfer requests between those two periods are discounted, other factors are 
not taken into account, causing the dropout rate to appear small, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norton said that since the state Department of Education uses the figures in a 
variety of reports and comparisons, district officials decided to embark on a 
study that would provide more accurate results. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there is a credibility gap between the two studies," Norton said. "But 
now we know exactly where we stand." 
</P>
<P>
Norton, director of alternative programs in the district, is also principal of 
Vail Continuation High School, which provides intensive counseling and tutoring 
to students on the verge of dropping out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new study did not address why students drop out, Norton said, most 
leave because they are disenchanted with the school system. A significant 
number of dropouts, he added, are pregnant teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
The largest number of dropouts occurred in the 10th grade, the study showed. 
Norton said he could offer no explanation why students left then. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 51 school districts in the county, Montebello Unified has one of the 
lowest dropout rates, according to a recently published booklet by the Los 
Angeles County Office of Education, which lists dropout rates that have been 
calculated by the conventional method. 
</P>
<P>
Under the conventional reporting system, Montebello's 4.4% dropout rate for the 
1987-88 school year was lower than that of any surrounding district. Los 
Angeles Unified, the largest district in the county, had a dropout rate of 14%, 
according to the county statistical manual. 
</P>
<P>
Dropout rates totaled 5.8% at Downey Unified, 5.7% at Alhambra Unified, 31.5% 
at El Rancho Unified, and 7.5% at Whittier Union High School District, 
according to the booklet. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we are doing a better job than other districts," Montebello Supt. John 
P. Cook said. "But we can do better." 
</P>
<P>
Norton has listed 11 recommendations to help lower the district dropout rate. 
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
School officials need to "formally identify" at-risk students in the second and 
third grades and "establish a mechanism for tracking and counseling those 
students (into) high school." Norton told the board that students who tend to 
drop out of high school often exhibit signs at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
Schools should re-examine current "schoolwide policies and rules in order to 
identify any which may place students in the position of being forced out of 
school" by inflexible rules. Norton said he has encountered students who were 
kicked out of school because of a "rule that was enforced wrongly." 
</P>
<P>
Some rules, such as loss of credit for tardiness, can "really turn kids off 
from school," Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
The district should create programs aimed at preparing students to return to 
regular high school classes, one of the best ways to increase self-confidence 
in learning, Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
All at-risk students should be allowed to complete a fifth year of high school 
if they have been attending that school in their fourth year. Under current 
rules, most students are required to enroll in adult education programs after 
four years in high school. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Darline P. Robles, assistant superintendent for pupil and 
community services, said a 33-member committee will meet several times to 
discuss the recommendations before suggesting new programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just sit back and say that 'fine, we have a head full of numbers.' We 
have to do something about lowering the dropout rate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

COMPTON TURNS DOWN BUDGET, OUSTS CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks before it must approve a spending plan for the coming fiscal year, 
the City Council has ousted the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The council abruptly placed City Manager James Goins on paid administrative 
leave Tuesday night and told his senior assistant, Howard Caldwell, to fill in 
until a new manager is found. 
</P>
<P>
The council apparently rejected the budget Goins submitted shortly before he 
was ousted by unanimous vote of the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Statements 
</P>
<P>
The city's financial condition remained unclear because of conflicting 
statements from the council and the city's staff. 
</P>
<P>
In what it described as its first austerity measure, the council Tuesday 
ordered employees to turn in all city cars. From now on, the council said, cars 
will be checked out as needed for city business. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell, however, emerged from a Wednesday morning meeting with department 
heads and other top administrators and said: "We don't feel we're in a budget 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
But City Controller Timothy Brown, who has been warning for months that the 
city was going to be in the red, said Wednesday morning that he would stick 
with the budget projections he gave the council months ago, showing a "severe 
shortfall." 
</P>
<P>
He also said Wednesday morning that it would be "a fair assumption" that the 
city has more employees than it can afford to pay, and may have to resort to 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$65 Million in Revenue 
</P>
<P>
According to estimates that Brown gave the council, the city next year will 
have only $65 million in revenue and $16 million in what is known as "fund 
balances," money that can be carried over from the previous budget year but 
must remain in specific funds and cannot be moved into the general fund, which 
is used to pay most employees. 
</P>
<P>
Goins' budget document contained several proposed increases in taxes and fees 
as well as several layoffs. The proposed budget totaled $101.2 million, down 
from $119.4 million in the current fiscal year ending June 30. He said 
previously that the budget next year would be lower because the city's 
redevelopment agency has completed most of its land acquisition and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cuts, Goins suggested eliminating the city's emergency ambulance 
service. Fire department paramedics, however, would have been retained. 
</P>
<P>
Goins was also recommending demotions of officers in the Fire Department and of 
four lieutenants in the Police Department to help balance the new budget. 
</P>
<P>
Six unfilled patrol positions in the Police Department would have been 
eliminated. Four are scheduled to be filled by recruits who are now being 
trained at the police academy. Over the past three years, the council has 
appropriated money for 18 new patrol officers. Two employees in the public 
information office would have been laid off. Brown said that three people in 
his office also would have lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Goins' budget also called for the elimination of the city's jazz festival and 
most city publications such as the calendar and the Windows magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he could not provide a specific deficit estimate because he had not 
seen the budget that Goins and his staff put together for the council. Brown 
works directly for the council, not the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Proposal Due 
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with department heads Wednesday morning, Caldwell said that he 
will present a new budget proposal to the council next Tuesday. Despite his 
assertion that there was no budget crisis, city employees expressed concern 
over possible layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
One secretary said employees feared there would be layoffs, even when Goins was 
denying all spring that the city was facing a budget deficit. Goins and Brown 
became involved in a dispute over the city's finances. Brown insisted that the 
city was headed for serious trouble and Goins insisted that layoffs could be 
avoided if the council would agree to raise some taxes and fees, such as water 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Mayor Walter R. Tucker and two incumbent council members were running 
for reelection, fighting off criticism from citizens and political opponents 
that the city was not delivering services that matched the taxes residents were 
already paying. Tucker was reelected after a runoff but the two council 
members, Robert L. Adams and Floyd A. James, were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Under the City Charter, the manager is required to have the proposed budget 
available for public viewing 10 days before the public budget hearing. Goins 
handed the council members budget proposals only 10 minutes before the public 
hearing Tuesday. The late budget apparently sealed his fate. 
</P>
<P>
When an audience packed with city residents heard that their ambulance service 
was to be cut and that the police force would not have the number of officers 
the residents had been promised, Goins came under heavy fire. For more than an 
hour council members and residents railed against the proposed spending cuts 
and the late delivery of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed Meeting 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing the council held a closed session and excluded the city 
staff. After about 45 minutes, Goins was summoned into the meeting. The council 
then resumed its public meeting and announced that the city manager had been 
placed on paid administrative leave for 90 days. Goins left the Tuesday night 
meeting and refused to comment. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Patricia Moore said after the meeting: "We're broke as a city if 
we have to raise the water rates to balance the budget." Goins' budget did not 
list a specific amount for the water-rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
Goins came to Compton in 1980 as a special assistant in the city manager's 
office. He served in a variety of positions before being appointed acting city 
manager in 1986. In January, 1987, he was named to the post permanently. He 
previously held government positions in Salt Lake City.

RECALL GROUP IN POMONA WILL TRY TO OUST BRYANT

<P>
Outraged at the actions taken by a new City Council majority, a citizens group 
has formed to seek the recall of a controversial councilman who is seen as the 
leader of the new coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee to Recall C. L. (Clay) Bryant held its first meeting last week to 
plot strategy for a petition drive that would take place in August. The group 
is a spinoff of Citizens for a Positive Pomona, which was created last month to 
protest the firing of City Administrator A. J. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The new majority, forged when Councilman Tomas Ursua was sworn in April 24, has 
embarked on an aggressive campaign of change in city government. After firing 
Wilson on May 1, the coalition -- composed of Bryant, Ursua and Councilwoman 
Nell Soto -- eliminated three top administrative positions from the budget and 
have promised further cutbacks to free up money for more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of Citizens for a Positive Pomona last month, 125 of 130 residents 
present favored recall as the way to stop the changes favored by the new 
majority, said Melody Peterson, co-chairwoman of the recall group. The 
consensus was also clear on which council member should be the focus of their 
efforts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stiff Opposition 
</P>
<P>
"It was overwhelming that Clay Bryant was the one they wished to remove," 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the recall effort is in its early stages, it has already 
encountered stiff opposition from loyal Bryant supporters, who have formed a 
group called Citizens Against Recall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a bunch of citizens who just feel the recall is rather uncalled 
for," said Larry Rasmussen, chairman of the anti-recall group. "It is our basic 
belief that reasons for recall ought to be moral turpitude or the fact that 
you're ripping off the city. (The effort to recall Bryant) is really a 
disregard for political principles." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at his City Hall office, Bryant dismissed the recall movement 
with a wave of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I have too much to do to worry about malcontents," Bryant said. "There's no 
more than 150 malcontents out there who are just sounding off. They don't 
understand what a time-consuming and expensive proposition (a recall) is. . . . 
It's all (Mayor) Donna Smith's activity, trying to keep a pot boiling when 
there's nothing in the pot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Involvement 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who has locked horns with Bryant numerous times since he was elected 
to the council in November, 1987, has denied any involvement in the recall 
movement. Smith said she is neutral on the drive to force Bryant out of office. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't done anything to encourage them," Smith said. "I hate to see a 
recall. . . . There aren't very many that are successful. But I'm glad to see 
responsible citizens stand up and say, 'That's enough.' If that's all that 
comes out of this movement, I applaud it. I'm glad to see citizens get involved 
in city government." 
</P>
<P>
The recall group may not serve notice of its intentions to Bryant, who was 
reelected to a four-year term in March, until July 24. Under the state 
Elections Code, a candidate must be in office at least 90 days before a recall 
can be commenced. 
</P>
<P>
Recall proponents plan to start gathering signatures in August and are hoping 
to force a special election on the recall next June. If an election were held 
and voters favored a recall, Bryant would be out of office the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The length of the recall process was a major reason why the group did not set 
its sights on Soto, who is halfway through a four-year term. Ursua was not 
targeted because some members of the group said that he should be given a 
chance to show his independence of Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
"He's new," Peterson said of Ursua. "A lot of people have a lot of hope in him. 
Clay has a track record on which to base decisions regarding a recall." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the actions of the new majority, recall proponents are also 
incensed by a letter from Bryant to the National Civic League, which bestows 
All-America City honor on 10 municipalities each year. Bryant asked the 
Denver-based organization not to give the award to Pomona because the city was 
undeserving. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was spared a recall effort, Soto denounced the group seeking 
Bryant's ouster as divisive. 
</P>
<P>
"Clay was just elected," Soto said. "I don't think Citizens for a Positive 
Pomona is being very positive. . . . Clay has been the champion for the people 
of Pomona and those out there whom he has helped know that and that's why they 
keep reelecting him." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said Bryant's support has waned since the last election gave him 
control of the City Council. She said many residents have become disillusioned 
by the actions of the majority and by incidents such as Bryant's statement that 
those who oppose him are "idiots, imbeciles and nobodies." 
</P>
<P>
"These incidents have changed a lot of people's minds," Peterson said.

MAYOR OF AZUSA SAYS HE'LL RAZE GHOST TOWN

<P>
Mayor Eugene F. Moses, facing a public nuisance hearing today on his Western 
ghost town, has offered to tear down the would-be theme park that city 
officials contend is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
This month, the city began proceedings against Moses over the 2.5-acre facility 
he began building, but never completed, at the mouth of the San Gabriel Canyon 
in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The city has alleged that the ghost town lacks required use and building 
permits, adequate parking, landscaping and proper storage facilities. A "notice 
of violations and request for corrections" sent to Moses by the city in March 
says the ghost town is in a generally dilapidated state. 
</P>
<P>
In asking for a 30-day extension of the hearing, Moses has proposed that the 
public nuisance action be dropped and that the city allow him to keep three 
buildings for up to a year. The grace period would allow him time to sell off 
his numerous Old West relics and antiques, which he would store in the 
remaining buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing officer could order Moses to demolish the ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6-Month Grace Period 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they are negotiating with Moses. They said they are willing 
to continue the hearing for 30 days and are leaning toward giving the mayor a 
six-month grace period to demolish the last three buildings. "It breaks my 
heart, but I know it has to be done, because I'm the mayor and I want to 
comply," Moses said. "I don't want to take any more harassment. It kills me, 
but I have to take it down." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Moses said there was nothing wrong with the ghost town and that the 
nuisance action was a "political vendetta" by his council foes, Councilmen 
Harry L. Stemrich and Tony D. Naranjo. The councilmen denied Moses' assertions, 
saying the mayor has been treated the same as everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
While Moses continues to claim the proceedings are political, he said he wanted 
to avoid a confrontation with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take it down and clean it up," Moses said. "My job was to become 
a role model resident and do everything I need to do to clean it up. I'm not 
giving in. But the thing is, I have to do what's right." 
</P>
<P>
Moses would like to sell the dozen remaining cabins, shacks and buildings to 
Western buffs but said demolition could begin as early as Tuesday, if he gets 
no buyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resemble Old West Town 
</P>
<P>
Originally intended as a smaller likeness of Knott's Berry Farm, Moses' 
property contains about 15 cabins, stores and shacks arranged to resemble an 
Old West town. Among the town's relics are a complete blacksmith's shop, a 
horse-drawn fire wagon and authentic pieces of Western memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
An Old West enthusiast, Moses said his dream of a theme park ended when a past 
City Council approved a large condominium project close to his property. 
</P>
<P>
"They put in the condos, and that put the final dart into the ghost town," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A standard review of city records, which uncovered the alleged code violations, 
was initiated last year when Moses attempted to sell the property, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing of Moses' intention to sell, Stemrich in January initiated a study 
on changing the zoning of the ghost town area. Stemrich said he was concerned 
an apartment or condominium project would be built on the property, currently 
zoned commercial-recreational. 
</P>
<P>
Consideration of a possible zoning change, which could make Moses' site much 
less lucrative, has been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Moses said that a potential buyer backed out as a result of Stemrich's action 
and said he may sue individual council members at a later date. Moses said he 
did not know what the buyer intended to do with the property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Plans for Property 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to when the ghost town is gone, Moses said he has no plans for 
the property, but added that he would not sell to anyone who wants to build 
condominiums or an apartment building. In the past, Moses has opposed both 
kinds of developments in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad," Moses said of the outcome. "A lot of people are going to miss this 
place."

LONG ARM OF LAW TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE IN POLICE GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thugs, take note. Next week is not the time to knock over that Oxnard Boulevard 
convenience store or that A Street bank you've been eyeing. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Sunday, about 5,200 police officers from throughout the state will 
converge on Oxnard for the annual California Police Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The six-day event is expected to attract representatives from about 400 
departments spanning most levels of law enforcement -- from city police 
officers and county sheriff's deputies to members of the U.S. Border Patrol and 
federal marshals. Even state lottery investigators are expected to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"Oxnard is going to be a very safe place," said patrol officer patrol officer 
Lee Wilco, co-chairman of the Oxnard Police Department's organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
It also will be crowded. City officials expect 50,000 spectators -- most of 
them from out of town -- to gather to watch the long arm of the law flex its 
muscle in 45 competitive events, including arm-wrestling, boxing and 
bodybuilding. 
</P>
<P>
The throngs attracted by the games are expected to pump $5 million into Oxnard 
and four other Ventura County cities where events will be held and contestants 
will hang their hats. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few other times the county has seen a convention on this order, city 
officials say, was when Oxnard was host for the 1985 Police Olympics, billed as 
the second-largest sporting event after the international Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels were so packed, Wilcox said, that he had to put up two competitors at 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the week's festive atmosphere, competing officers still must go by 
the book. They can be disqualified, fined or even put on probation for 
roughhousing, cheating or even swearing. Judges can call for a hearing on the 
smallest infraction. A judge once yanked a gold medal from a foulmouthed power 
lifter on his way out of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"John McEnroe wouldn't even get past the judges," said Bob Burke, a member of 
the board of directors of the California Police Athletic Federation, which 
oversees the games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incentive to Officers 
</P>
<P>
Unseemly behavior, organizers say, would defeat the purpose of the games, which 
were founded in 1967 as an incentive for police officers to keep in shape but 
have continued as a means of generating good will. 
</P>
<P>
"These are mainly people who get in the paper for shooting someone," Burke 
said. "We want to show them in a positive light." 
</P>
<P>
As in the conventional Olympics, the top three competitors in each category win 
gold, silver or bronze medals. But in the police version, competitors who place 
fourth and fifth also take home medals -- and the thrill of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts so good," said Jim Struck, an Oxnard police officer who last year won 
gold medals in the light-heavyweight boxing and karate divisions. To make sure 
he gets to repeat the experience, Struck said he has been working out two hours 
daily on a punching bag and in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Other competitors have been as earnest. Take Sgt. Easie Williams, a Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department detective who coaches the largest boxing team in 
the competition. He has been pitting his 10 charges against each other in 12 to 
15 rounds a week -- that on top of a running regime of two to three miles 
daily, plus weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys aren't fooling around," Wilcox said. "It's fierce competition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
World-Class Athletes 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some competitors such as George Lopez, who will box in the 156-pound 
weight class Wednesday and Friday, are world-class athletes. 
</P>
<P>
A 29-year-old community relations officer for the Los Angeles Police 
Department, Lopez fought for Argentina in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, where he 
was defeated by Ray Downey, the Canadian boxer who went on to win a bronze 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a good, crisp jab," said Larry Moore, who coaches Lopez as the Police 
Department's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors will begin arriving Sunday, although the action does not begin 
until 8 a.m. the next day, with the triathlon through Oxnard State Beach behind 
the Embassy Suites Hotel, headquarters for the games. Admission to all events 
is free. 
</P>
<P>
The competitive roster includes such Olympian staples as tennis, rowing, track 
and field, and equestrian events. Many contests, however, are tailored to the 
talents of police officers -- arm-wrestling, pistol shooting and contests with 
police dogs. Such events as surfing, water-skiing and scuba highlight the 
"California" in the competition's name. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers expect the boxing matches, which begin at 7 p.m. Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday in the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, to attract the widest following. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boxing Fans 
</P>
<P>
On one night alone in 1985, boxing attracted more than 2,000 fans, the 
auditorium's capacity. To catch any overflow this year, organizers plan to pipe 
fights via cable television into two adjacent conference rooms. 
</P>
<P>
It is that sort of attention to detail that won Oxnard the 1989 bid over two 
other cities. Organizers said they were impressed by the welcome they received 
in 1985. At the time, Oxnard was the smallest city to have hosted the 
California games. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually you don't get that much community support," said Duke Nyhus, the 
founder of the games and the executive director of the California Police 
Athletics Federation. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Oxnard will go down in history as home to the last California Police 
Olympics. In an attempt to avoid a dispute with the International Olympic 
Committee, which has sought to enjoin police organizations in other states from 
referring to their games as "Olympics," the California Police Athletics 
Federation plans to change the name of the event to the California Police 
Summer Games beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lengthy Planning 
</P>
<P>
But Oxnard's role has not come without sacrifice. The Oxnard Police Department 
has already invested three years in planning the games. Since September, Wilcox 
and another officer have been relieved of regular duties to devote themselves 
full time to organizing the games. 
</P>
<P>
The event is expected to cost the city $350,000, which it hopes to recoup 
through entrance fees for participants, although some cities have not been so 
successful. Newport Beach, for instance, lost money when it was the host for 
the games in 1986, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
While many existing facilities were suited to particular events, such as the 
L.A. Raiders training field where daily soccer games will be held, others had 
to be jury-rigged. Organizers, aided by Santa Paula Honda Automobiles, had to 
build a race track on the future site of a housing development at Gonzales Road 
and Oxnard Boulevard for motocross events Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Some streets will be closed next Thursday and Friday to make way for a 
decathlon and a 50-mile bike ride. What's more, organizers plan to tap the 
services of more than 500 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous undertaking," said Mayor Nao Takasugi, "but it brings 
recognition to the city of Oxnard and gives it an economic boost, and builds 
police morale."

PRYOR DECIDES NOT TO RUN, ENDORSES MAYOR KELL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Luanne W. Pryor, last year's dark horse mayoral candidate, has decided to 
endorse incumbent Mayor Ernie Kell, throwing her support behind a man she 
previously criticized as a follower lacking both vision and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Ending months of indecision about her political future, Pryor surprised 
followers of local politics by announcing this week not only that she will not 
run, but that she was endorsing Kell in his race against Councilman Tom Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Kell's camp immediately took the endorsement as a boon that virtually ensured 
Kell's victory at the polls next April. "After this evening, it's going to be 
very easy," Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton, one of Kell's political allies, 
declared to a banquet room full of the mayor's supporters at a fund-raising 
dinner Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Clark maintained his even-handed demeanor when informed of the news. "Luanne 
Pryor is certainly not the key to this race," he said, adding that it was hard 
to predict how much weight her endorsement would carry. "I'm rather surprised 
because she hasn't been particularly close to Mr. Kell or his positions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Newcomer 
</P>
<P>
Pryor, a public relations executive and political newcomer with a comparatively 
meager campaign fund, managed to capture nearly a quarter of the votes in last 
year's election to choose the city's full-time mayor. Her unexpected success 
forced Kell into a runoff with Councilwoman Jan Hall, which Kell won. 
</P>
<P>
Had Pryor entered next year's race, the concern in Kell's quarters was that she 
would again take votes from the mayor. Though Clark said he has assumed that if 
Pryor didn't run, he might pick up a good part of her support, Kell's advisers 
look to a poll from the Hall-Kell race. The majority of Pryor's supporters 
indicated they would vote for Kell rather than Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement at the $250-a-ticket fund-raiser in a downtown hotel, 
Pryor said she has watched Kell grow in his new position during the past four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been looking very carefully at what has been happening and Ernie Kell 
knows that I have been looking and I have come to the conclusion that the man 
we honor this evening has done an excellent job as our first full-time mayor. 
He has proved that the newly created position works." 
</P>
<P>
That was not Pryor's opinion just a few months ago, when she said in an 
interview that she thought Long Beach residents needed "somebody who's more 
awake" than Kell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Strong Leadership' 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see any strong leadership, I don't see anything exciting 
happening," she said then of Kell's performance. "People have said to me that 
they think the (new full-time mayor's position) is a waste of time and it 
hasn't amounted to anything." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Pryor said her support of Kell was not an overnight 
conversion. "I have noticed a decided change. If I had not seen that change. I 
would not be here." She also said she preferred Kell to Clark. "I don't like 
his condescension," she said of Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Another undoubted factor for Pryor, who retains political ambitions, is that 
both she and Kell are Democrats, while Clark is a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Money was a decisive issue in keeping Pryor out of next year's race. "I don't 
think I could have raised the amount of money it would have taken to win this 
race," Pryor said, noting that unlike Kell, she could not pour large sums of 
her own money into a campaign. She still has a campaign debt of $6,000 left 
over from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kell and Pryor insisted that no deal had been made for help with her 
campaign debt or for an appointment to any city commission or committee. 
</P>
<P>
To the extent that she is eyeing any position right now, Pryor said she is 
toying with the idea of running against Assemblyman Dennis Brown ( R-Long 
Beach) for the 58th District seat.

THOUGHTS ON REJECTION OF SOUTH PASADENA SCHOOL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of Support South Pasadena Schools, we want to express our 
appreciation to the hundreds of parents, teachers, business people, school 
administrators and community members who worked tirelessly for the passage of 
Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
While the measure lost at the polls, we believe a coalition in support of our 
schools has been built. We also believe that Support South Pasadena Schools is 
a good example of the greatness of our community -- people working in concert 
to find solutions to some tough problems. 
</P>
<P>
When former President Reagan defeated Walter Mondale in 1984, his 59% of the 
vote was viewed as a "landslide victory," one of the biggest winning margins 
ever. Yet, when Proposition A garnered 63% of the vote on June 6, it was 
defeated because a two-thirds majority was required. It is sad, and it is 
completely undemocratic that a small minority -- about 1,700 voters out of 
14,000 registered -- could thwart the will of the substantial majority of us 
who supported Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
We want South Pasadena to have the best schools in the San Gabriel Valley. This 
will require excellent teachers, excellent facilities, excellent administrators 
and excellent programs. All of these require money, but money alone is not 
enough. People committed to building institutions, not destroying them, are 
even more important. 
</P>
<P>
After the election, many members of the community called with the excellent 
suggestion that we seek contributions to replace the lost $98 tax increase per 
parcel in the city. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, we will recommend to the school board that a fund be established 
called the Prop. A Fund. Monies deposited in that fund will be used for the 
same purpose for which monies raised under Prop. A would have been used -- to 
improve basic education, particularly reading, mathematics and science; to 
attract and retain excellent teachers; to provide library books and textbooks; 
to provide drug education programs, and to reduce class size. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks to come, pledge cards will be sent to members of the community. We 
won't be able to generate the same amount as Proposition A would have raised, 
but believe this effort is a step in the right direction.

St., South Gate, from 2:45 to 7:30 p.m. on the last Friday of every month. 
Donors must be healthy and 17 or older. Appointments can be made by calling the 
Red Cross at 739-5290. 
</P>

UTILITY TAX HIKES APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors has approved utility tax increases to help finance a 
budget for the next fiscal year of more than $212 million, an increase of $12 
million over the fiscal year that ends this month. 
</P>
<P>
The budget will give the Police Department eight new officers, raising its 
total strength to 219. It also provides $200,000 to create a new office of 
assistant city manager for human services. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted to raise the utility tax on water, power and gas for 
residential customers to the rate currently paid by commercial users. The 
action abolishes a rate differential established in 1985. The increase will 
cost the average residential customer $1.57 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The board also extended the tax on telephone service that now applies to calls 
made within California to interstate and international calls. The 7.86% tax on 
service will raise about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes a water rate increase of $6.3%, raising the average 
residential bill from $12.28 to $13.05 a month, and new refuse collection 
charges, raising the average rate for back-yard collection service at 
single-family homes to $18.70 per month, an increase of $1.20.

RULES FOR CITY RESTROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bathing, shaving or washing clothes in the city's public restrooms will no 
longer be tolerated under an ordinance given preliminary approval last week by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless people who have been "stripping down to their underwear and using 
restrooms as bathing facilities" at the Monrovia Community Center prompted the 
Community Services Commission to recommend the ban at its March 16 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance states that "no person shall disrobe, bathe or shave oneself or 
launder clothing" in public restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"As public restrooms they are open to anyone, but not to unrestricted use," 
according to City Atty. Rick Morillo. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons at the center have objected to the practice about twice a month, 
Director of Community Services Eileen Brownell wrote in a May report. An 
employee at the community center on West Palm Avenue said that the transients 
have been coming onto the premises for eight years, but that the problem has 
worsened in the last two. 
</P>
<P>
The ban will go into effect 30 days after the council gives it a final approval 
at its next meeting in two weeks.

CONSTRUCTION BAN EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has voted to extend a moratorium on multifamily residential 
construction in the neighborhood north of Wilshire Boulevard for another six 
months, limiting what residents have called a "demolition derby" and allowing 
city staff to draw up a plan that would restrict future development in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
In early May, complaints from residents about new development in the 
neighborhood bounded by Ocean Avenue, Montana Avenue, 14th Street and Wilshire 
Boulevard prompted the council to pass a 45-day emergency ordinance banning 
residential construction. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, Los Angeles is looking like Manhattan -- dark and dirty, 
disallowing for warmth and sunshine," said resident Linda Wilson at the City 
Council meeting on Tuesday night. "We must endeavor to protect the quality of 
life in our city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 6 to 1 to continue the moratorium until December. For the 
next six months, a task force of staff, tenants, condominium owners and 
resident landlords will work on a plan that would limit the number of projects 
per block and develop design standards that would make new buildings more 
compatible with those already there. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also asked the council to consider downzoning their neighborhood. But 
Planning Director Paul Berlant said that lowering density would only make land 
and rental values skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of single-family homes, low- and moderate-income housing and city 
projects are exempt from the moratorium, as are projects that received permits 
before April 28. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Christine Reed voted against the measure, saying a moratorium was 
not the solution to the neighborhood's problems.

THOUGHTS ON REJECTION OF SOUTH PASADENA SCHOOL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to the South Pasadena school district's financial planning 
strategy committee and the Proposition A campaign committee for their efforts 
on behalf of all South Pasadena residents. 
</P>
<P>
As the painful process of budget cutting must resume, we need to understand why 
a measure so beneficial to our community went down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was the eleventh-hour effort of a group ironically calling itself 
South Pasadenans for Integrity in Government. The group obviously did not lead 
by example, because it claimed that the district has 21 administrators when the 
district only has 14, and it made unwarranted attacks on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Proposition A opponents mistakenly draped themselves in the mantle 
of the Proposition 13 taxpayer revolt. But our measure was exactly what Howard 
Jarvis wanted -- people voting to assess themselves for their own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Then the opponents pointed to California's recently announced $2.5-billion 
surplus as the way out of our educational financing dilemma. They argued that, 
under Proposition 98, our fair share would be enough. But do we want to rely on 
state legislators whose political priorities have placed California in the 
bottom 4% of states in per-pupil spending? 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obvious benefits to South Pasadena from its public schools -- 
quality education for our children, property values and enhancement of our 
small-town charm -- the defeat of a modest assessment of less than $2 per week 
per household tells us something about ourselves. We are losing our sense of 
stewardship for our community as we seek relief for our financial plight 
elsewhere -- from Sacramento, from the lottery, from ever deeper cuts into our 
public school muscle. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, if more funds were needed, South Pasadena elected officials 
increased the applicable tax rates. Then, we recognized that we were only 
entitled to the quality of services for which we were willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
By defeating Proposition A, we have significantly limited our options. But we 
can put a revised parcel tax measure on the November ballot and give ourselves 
a second chance.

QUAKE SURVEY LAUNCHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is launching a survey to identify buildings that might be hazardous in 
case of a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that such a survey identify all unreinforced brick buildings 
built before 1934, but Beverly Hills will expand it to determine possible 
hazards in any buildings with a capacity of 100 or more people that date back 
to that era. 
</P>
<P>
The survey will also try to determine hazards in buildings with a capacity of 
300 or more that were built before 1976, when the city adopted its current 
building code. 
</P>
<P>
"Although unreinforced masonry buildings are considered the most hazardous, 
other types of buildings constructed before additional seismic design standards 
were adopted in 1976 have also proven to be potentially hazardous," said Ron 
Clark, the city's building and safety director. 
</P>
<P>
Owners will be notified if their buildings are found to be possible earthquake 
hazards, but Beverly Hills does not yet have an ordinance similar to Los 
Angeles legislation that requires such structures to be reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
"That is in the future. This the first step to developing an ordinance like 
that," Clark said.

RESIDENTS OBJECT TO HOSPITAL'S PLAN FOR PARKING STRUCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The June 5 Monterey Park City Council meeting will remain sadly in the memories 
of the homeowners who live near Garfield Hospital. That night they were 
betrayed by Councilwomen Betty Couch, Judy Chu and Pat Reichenberger and Mayor 
Barry Hatch, who voted to allow the hospital to build a five-level parking 
structure that will affect the quality of the homeowners' lives. 
</P>
<P>
The council members who voted for the garage didn't care because none of them 
would be affected by an ugly 40-foot wall, noise, more traffic congestion, 
pollution, fear of more crime in their area and devaluation of their property. 
The homeowners, concerned about the health and safety of their children and 
families, pleaded to the council for help, but their pleas fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
Something is rotten in this city when huge projects don't require an 
environmental impact report. Instead, the city uses a wimpy negative 
declaration that conveniently always favors money interests. The council even 
refused to request a copy of the hospital's master plan. Why were they in such 
a hurry to pamper the hospital and shaft the homeowners? 
</P>
<P>
Everyone sitting on the council promised voters the moon and protection from 
overdevelopment. By voting for a conditional-use permit for this project, it 
means they all said one thing when they were running for office but turned 180 
degrees after they were elected.

8% TELEPHONE TAX IMPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting in September, Santa Monica residents will pay an 8% tax to the city 
for out-of-state and international telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been taxing only long-distance phone calls made within California. 
The council voted 6 to 1 on Tuesday to impose additional taxes for interstate 
and international telephone calls originating in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The tax will apply to any telephone communication service, including mobile 
phones and facsimile machines. 
</P>
<P>
If taxpayers can prove they have already paid a tax on a phone call, they will 
be given a refund. This condition was included, said City Atty. Robert M. 
Myers, for those few cases in which a call originating in Santa Monica might be 
taxed by the city of Los Angeles, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David Finkel asked the city staff to look into exempting low-income 
residents, senior citizens and nonprofit organizations from the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Herb Katz said he opposed all telephone taxes and voted against the 
measure.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;

VOTE FOR FINISHED FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a resolution supporting the completion of the 710 
Freeway to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a gap in the freeway between Valley Boulevard in Alhambra and 
the 210 Freeway since 1964. The City Council unanimously adopted the resolution 
June 6 despite protests from South Pasadena officials opposing the 
state-approved route through their city. The resolution does not specify which 
of several routes under consideration should be used. 
</P>
<P>
In a report recommending that the council approve the resolution, Monrovia 
Director of Public Works Robert Sandwick said the city would benefit from 
decreased east-west traffic in the west San Gabriel Valley if the link is 
completed. Some motorists now take the 605 Freeway to avoid the gap, increasing 
traffic on the 210 Freeway and Monrovia's surface streets, including Huntington 
Drive, Duarte Road and Foothill Boulevard, he said.

SCOPE: PLAIN-OLD, EVERY-DAY, MOM-AND-APPLE-PIE PHILOSOPHY IN 80 CHARACTERS OR 
LESS IS ONE WOMAN'S WEEKLY CONTRIBUTION TO THE LONG BEACH LANDSCAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is an improbable source of mom-and-apple-pie-wisdom: a laundry company's 
sign board on a dowdy strip of Anaheim Street at the edge of the Cambodian 
business district. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there, week in and week out, year after year, Nuway Linen and Uniform 
Rental Service of Long Beach dispenses doses of homey sayings in four lines of 
80 characters or less. Drivers never know, cruising down Anaheim, what gem of 
Ann Landers-like advice will confront them, encouraging, teasing or 
sermonizing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you worry about missing the boat, remember the Titanic," Nuway counsels the 
keep-up-with-the-Joneses set. 
</P>
<P>
"To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing," the laundry 
instructs the sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
"Macho isn't mucho," it informs would-be tough guys. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep flaring and you will burn out soon," it warns the angry. 
</P>
<P>
The drive-by homilies have been appearing on the board since the 1950s, when 
Nuway erected the sign. But it was not until the 1970s that they became the 
board's regular fare, attracting a faithful following of readers who comment, 
offer their own slogans, and even kvetch if a boring advertisement too long 
replaces the tips for living. 
</P>
<P>
The musings are, in their down-home way, of course, a far more memorable 
advertisement for the commercial laundry than a "give us your dirty sheets" 
entreaty could ever be. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows where Nuway is, but if you say I work where the sign is, they 
know," said Rod Chandler, the company office manager who 11 years ago turned to 
one of his employees, Gini Conner, to take over the tradition of free advice. 
</P>
<P>
Conner, a Nuway worker for 13 years, feels the weight of her responsibility. 
After all, she has a reputation to uphold. 
</P>
<P>
People tell her they drive down Anaheim just to read her thought of the week. 
She has received fan letters ("They are not the ordinary, trite, cutesy quotes 
in the least," wrote one devotee), been invited to a bar by someone who wanted 
to buy her book of slogans (she didn't go and doesn't have the book), and had 
people walk in off the street to declare the rightness of her slogans. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to say they came out of my head, but it's not the truth," 
concedes Conner, who works in the accounts receivable department. 
</P>
<P>
Ever alert for the appropriately sized quote, Conner snatches them from the 
Reader's Digest, greeting cards, books and anybody who gives her one she likes. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged widow and mother of two grown children, Conner has her standards. 
The phrases can't be too political, too religious or too far out. By and large 
they reflect a "plain ol', every day, apple-pie, baseball and American-flag 
philosophy." It just so happens to be hers, and she says, "I think a lot of 
people still have those ideals." 
</P>
<P>
Only twice, Conner recalled, has anyone complained about the slogan of the 
week. One was perceived as anti-feminist. It was something about women and 
grocery lines. 
</P>
<P>
Only once can she remember being stuck for something new to put on the board. 
That was a few weeks ago, for Mother's Day week. She headed for a nearby 
drugstore, browsed through the cards and found something. "I didn't buy the 
card," she confessed. 
</P>
<P>
She tinkers with the idea of putting together a book of all the sayings she has 
used. People already think she has one. In fact, a teacher called her once, 
asking for a copy for her students, and got irate when Conner told her there 
was no such book. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone to the library and looked at quote books and I know I could do much 
better," she said, adding that they tend to be full of long-winded quotes from 
long-dead men such as Thomas Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
The laundry firm dates back to the 1920s, and although it was bought out by a 
national company in 1981, Nuway executives seem to like the old-fashioned 
flavor reflected by the sign board. 
</P>
<P>
Where else can they declare, as the board did: "Conference, a meeting of the 
bored." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing complaints that the board was devoted to advertising a truck 
Nuway was trying to sell, one of Conner's bosses told her to change the sign. 
</P>
<P>
"The boss told me to change the sign, so I did," the board read the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Dummy type at end of story is put there to get the pagination system to work 
properly. It will be cut off on makeup. 
</P>
<P>
'If you worry about missing the boat, remember the Titanic.' 
</P>
<P>
'To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.' 
</P>
<P>
'Macho isn't mucho.' 
</P>
<P>
'Keep flaring and you will burn out soon.'

RESIDENTS OBJECT TO HOSPITAL'S PLAN FOR PARKING STRUCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing on behalf of 122 people who have signed a petition about a 
five-level parking structure proposed by the Garfield Medical Center in 
Monterey Park. Our main concern is that it would directly face homes in the 600 
block of Baltimore Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The structure would have many adverse affects on us, but the Planning 
Commission did not feel it necessary to call for an environmental impact 
report. 
</P>
<P>
We suggested an alternative site (at the City Council meeting June 5) that was 
ignored. We feel that if the hospital had good intentions, it would practice 
some good neighbor policies and help mitigate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
You would think the council would practice some simple manners while people 
were speaking. Council members didn't appear to be listening when these 
concerns were raised. 
</P>
<P>
I truly question the qualification of some of these people to run City Hall and 
defend and protect our bests interests, although Councilman Christopher F. 
Houseman did seem to be worried about the impact on our neighborhood.

COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY OKS NEW REDEVELOPMENT ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakewood City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to create a redevelopment 
zone that would take in 15 different sites scattered throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Sales tax revenues are not increasing as rapidly as they used to, city 
officials say, and upgrading small shopping areas and luring new commercial 
developers to small, vacant industrial sites is a way of maintaining the city's 
economic base. 
</P>
<P>
Some 25% of the city's tax revenue last year came from sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sites that fall in the new zone -- the city's second redevelopment 
area -- is the old Chevron tank farm on Downey Avenue in the northwest corner 
of Lakewood. Last year, city staff members recommended that the 33-acre site be 
zoned for commercial and office buildings but the council rejected the idea 
after residents in the area objected strenuously. Under the new redevelopment 
plan, the site would be used for a housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
By making use of redevelopment laws, the city can give financial incentives 
such as low-interest loans to private landowners or businesses to help them 
expand or upgrade their facilities.

CHILDREN'S, MARITIME MUSEUMS GEARING UP FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
In Oxnard, hundred-year floods have been more common than museum openings, yet 
within two days next week, two new treasure troves will pass significant 
milestones toward completion. 
</P>
<P>
After a ribbon-cutting Saturday afternoon, a temporary home for the Gull Wings 
Children's Museum will formally open for business Wednesday in a 
7,400-square-foot building on West 4th Street that once was occupied by the 
USO. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, the Ventura County Parks and Harbor Foundation will break 
ground Thursday on a 5,000-square-foot building for the Ventura County Maritime 
Museum at Channel Islands Harbor. The museum is expected to open in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
More than two decades (and two hundred-year floods) have come and gone since 
the conversion of the Carnegie Library to Oxnard's only museum, the Carnegie 
Cultural Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of both new museums say Oxnard is the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare Dockside Space 
</P>
<P>
For Frank Crane, executive director of the maritime museum, it was where he was 
able to find rare dockside space and a developer, Martin V. Smith, willing to 
foot the bill for the $500,000 structure. Smith plans to build a commercial 
complex, including a restaurant, next to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
For Pat James, director of the children's museum, Oxnard was the place where 
the City Council not only agreed to fund a feasibility study and promotional 
campaign but also rent her the building at well below the market rate. 
</P>
<P>
A retired teacher, she is hoping that the public will prove as easy a sell. 
There are about 400 children's museums in the United States, but some 350 have 
been built in the last three years, James said. 
</P>
<P>
James figures that most people will draw a blank when it comes to the 
relatively new phenomenon that allows children to learn concepts in science, 
history and social studies by playing with exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people hear the word museum and think of glass-enclosed boxes," said the 
35-year classroom veteran. "But children's museums are based on the hands-on 
concept." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Facility 
</P>
<P>
Museum directors had originally hoped to hold out for a facility at least twice 
as large, but decided that opening temporarily on 4th Street would give them an 
opportunity to get the concept across. They hope to win support for a larger, 
permanent facility. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the approach has been working, James said. Adults who visited the 
museum in the past month as the final exhibits were being constructed murmured, 
"Oh, that's what it's all about,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Children, meanwhile, seemed to understand immediately. 
</P>
<P>
They dug enthusiastically for petrified wood and fossils in "Discovery," a 
sandbox designed to simulate an archeological dig. They took glee in walking 
with crutches and walkers in "Just Suppose," an exhibit designed to encourage 
understanding of the disabled. And they frolicked among the museum's collection 
of costumes and hats, posing before brightly lit mirrors and on a stage where 
they were allowed to flaunt their new identities. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Bohan, a Port Hueneme surgical technologist whose 7-year-old twin sons 
visited the museum Saturday, said it fills a long-overlooked void. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Much for Children 
</P>
<P>
"There's the beach and a museum at the Ventura Harbor, but there isn't much to 
do with kids around here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a permanent home, museum directors hope to devote an entire wing to the 
heritage of the county's ethnic groups. Another wing, which would house an 
aircraft fuselage, would be devoted to flight. 
</P>
<P>
But the temporary museum, which will be open Wednesdays through Sundays, is by 
no means sparse. For $1 admission, children can tinker with a model railroad 
scene complete with a circus train; a scaled-down version of a nipa hut, a 
Filipino hut made of palm trees, and an exhibition of magnets. "Granny's 
Attic," a collection of old photographs and mementos, lines the entryway. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of Saturday's ribbon-cutting, organizers hope to have completed a 
makeup table in the costume area and "Colors," an exhibition that teaches the 
principles of blending colors by allowing children to overlay differently 
colored glass squares. 
</P>
<P>
For crafts projects, they plan to have such industrial castoffs as hose 
fittings, wood chips and Styrofoam packing material. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stretch Their Imagination' 
</P>
<P>
"We want children to stretch their imagination," said James, who at 76 still 
has the verve of a favorite kindergarten teacher. "We want them to use their 
heads." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the maritime museum's Crane hopes to stretch imaginations in a 
different direction. 
</P>
<P>
The institution will focus on the rich and largely overlooked history of the 
coastal region from Point Mugu to Point Conception, said Crane, 73, a retired 
computer executive who has been a sailboat enthusiast since his teens. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in mid-1990, rotating exhibitions of ship models, ship relics and 
nautical art will draw attention to the glory days of sailing -- the period 
before the introduction of steam engines in the 1800s, he said. The museum's 
waterfront location will also allow it to occasionally exhibit an entire 
vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The coast was visited by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, Sir Frances Drake and 
possibly 12th-Century Chinese explorers, he said. There also is evidence that 
the first ship built on the California coast was assembled by missionaries near 
what is Goleta near Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maritime History Ignored 
</P>
<P>
For all the color, however, much of Ventura County's early maritime history has 
gone largely ignored, Crane said. His group, which is dedicated solely to 
founding the museum, has worked since 1986 to change that. Officials at other 
museums applaud the efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to preserve this history," said Frances Johnson Pietro, curator 
of exhibits at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art. "Our museum has 
really not addressed the maritime involvement in Ventura. We only touch upon 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the maritime museum are reluctant to discuss their funding needs, 
pending a study by a consultant. But they are expected to raise money for the 
nonprofit museum through individual and corporate donations and other 
fund-raising activities. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, directors are preparing to assemble a collection. 
</P>
<P>
They have traveled to maritime museums on the East Coast and in Europe, and 
negotiated with owners of art collections. They have consulted with maritime 
historians and curators of important maritime collections. 
</P>
<P>
And in a business park on Oxnard's eastern end, master ship modeler Harry 
Arrington unpacks crate after crate of tub-sized replicas of the Mayflower, the 
USS Constitution and the HMS Bounty. He will later advise directors whether to 
acquire any of the models, which have been sent by dealers selling them for as 
much as $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of details to be put together," Crane said. "It's a very 
complex project."

BOND MEASURE HAD SUPPORT OF DEVELOPERS, WASTE FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out-of-town developers and waste disposal companies were among the big 
contributors to a group that supported an $8-million bond issue, rejected by 
voters in April, to build a new library and fire station in West Hollywood, 
financial records show. 
</P>
<P>
In records filed with the city clerk last week, West Hollywood Residents for 
Proposition A reported having spent $11,720 in its losing bid to promote the 
bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which closed its books on June 1, had as its treasurer Councilman 
John Heilman. Mayor Abbe Land was listed as the only other controlling officer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official of Fair Representation for West Hollywood, which led the 
fight against the measure, and whose organizers included Councilman Steve 
Schulte, said this week that the group raised $11,199 in contributions -- more 
than half of it from landlords. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$100 in Debt 
</P>
<P>
Treasurer David Gould said his group, which is $100 in debt, plans "to close 
its books as soon as we raise the $100." By law, it has until June 30 to submit 
its final campaign disclosure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the contributions to the group headed by Heilman and Land, $2,500 came from 
people associated with Rossmoor Regency, the Laguna Hills-based real estate 
company that developed Leisure World, which wants to build a luxury residential 
complex for senior citizens in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Rossmoor and a sister company each contributed $500. Three other $500 
contributions came from individuals associated with the firm: developer Ross 
Cortese; accountant Mary Kettle Larkin, and project manager Lewis Davis and his 
wife, Carol Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other contributors were a couple of waste disposal companies that are 
among a handful still in the running for a piece of the residential garbage 
business, once city officials reduce the number of firms that haul West 
Hollywood's trash from 23 to one or two. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waste Disposal Firms 
</P>
<P>
Records show that John Mardichian, who heads Murcole Disposal Co. of Compton, 
donated $950, and served as an intermediary for another $950 contribution from 
a Palm Desert man. Consolidated Disposal Service of Santa Fe Springs gave the 
group $750. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the endorsement of four members of the City Council and support from 
the politically influential Coalition for Economic Survival, a renters' rights 
group, voters opposed the measure by a margin of 52% to 48%. A two-thirds vote 
was needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure portrayed the election as a referendum on the city's 
long-planned civic center in West Hollywood Park. They claimed the bond issue 
was a backhand attempt to squeeze more money for the center, because the 
library and fire station were originally part of the center's design. 
</P>
<P>
Fair Representation for West Hollywood received $4,500 from West Hollywood 
Concerned Citizens, and $1,500 from the Greater Los Angeles Apartment Assn., 
Gould said. Both are landlord organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Gould said that $3,000 of the group's donations came "from about 20 
contributors" and that the remainder of the money was from West Hollywood 
residents who gave $100 or less to help defeat the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Other contributors to the pro-Proposition A campaign included Gruen Associates 
of Los Angeles, architectural engineers for the civic center project, $900; 
Raleigh Enterprises of Los Angeles, $900, and Pomona Enterprises of Cypress, 
$900. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign organization of Councilwoman Helen Albert donated $900, and the 
Pacific Design Center gave $500 to the pro-proposition group. All 19 other 
entities it listed as contributors were from outside West Hollywood.

BOARD TO WEIGH FATE OF BEVERLY HILLS HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
REPORT INCLUDES PLAN TO DEVELOP SCHOOL PROPERTY TO RAISE MONEY FOR DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite an overwhelmingly negative public reaction, a controversial proposal to 
tear down historic Beverly Hills High School and replace it with a high-rise 
development will be considered this month by the Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to redevelop the high school site near Century City was one of 
several options included in a final report issued by the Beverly Hills Unified 
School District's real estate committee. For nearly three years, the committee 
has been examining ways of developing district properties to raise money for 
the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The committee touched off a storm of protest in March when it introduced in a 
preliminary report the idea of tearing down the high school. Since then, the 
committee has held five public hearings, incorporating public reaction in its 
final report. The Board of Education plans to discuss the findings in the 
report at its June 27 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We dealt with a number of different proposals in our report, but the one that 
everyone wanted to talk about was the redevelopment of the high school and the 
reaction was negative," said committee chairman Kenneth Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Choices 
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman added that the community will have to make some 
difficult choices. "It's like comparing apples and oranges," he said. "How do 
you balance the educational needs of children, the needs for smaller class 
sizes and teachers salaries with the environmental concerns like open space, 
density and traffic." 
</P>
<P>
The committee said the district could produce annual revenues ranging from 
$500,000 to $16 million from the various proposals to develop district 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
The money generated would be used to help bail out the district, which has a 
$26 million budget and projects an annual shortfall of about $1 million a year 
over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-acre high school campus sits in the shadow of Century City high-rise 
office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the district would raze the existing high school and 
construct a new "state-of-the art high school" on the northern 19 acres. By 
using the 19 acres more efficiently, most open space and playing fields would 
be preserved, according to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining eight acres at Olympic Boulevard and Spalding Drive would be 
leased to a developer for construction of an office complex. Depending on the 
size of the development, the district could earn $10 million a year from the 
venture, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that before the plan could be implemented, the district would 
have to figure out a way for the high school to function during the 
construction period. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's report also suggests using the district's headquarters as a 
potential site for other development. It also lists parking lots and 
playgrounds as potential sites for development. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the report suggests that a portion of the playground at Horace 
Mann Elementary School be used to build a row of one-story retail stores along 
Robertson Boulevard. Students would use the roof as playground space and 
parking would be provided under the stores. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's board meeting, a group of parents presented the board with a 
petitions bearing 450 signatures protesting redevelopment of the high school 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"It is some of the best open space in the city," said Dr. Brian Kahn. "Once you 
build on it, it's gone forever. . . . That's the wrong moral message to send." 
</P>
<P>
School board member Betty Wilson praised the committee. "It gave us all the 
options available to us. It did just what it was supposed to do."

PLAN CALLS FOR REPEAL OF LANDSCAPE TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

WEST COVINA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials, confronted by angry homeowners claiming that they are being 
taxed but are receiving no services, recommended Monday that a special 
landscape assessment be discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
Residents would have to assume responsibility for greenery upkeep under the 
plan, which must be approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a group of South Hills homeowners led by Frank Barbagallo protested 
the landscape taxes, arguing that in the nine years the city has collected 
about $628,000 from their neighborhood, developers have not been forced to 
install the required greenery. 
</P>
<P>
Barbagallo has charged that the city has instead used the money for purposes 
not connected to the district and that interest earnings have been added to the 
city's general fund. City officials say the expenditures have been proper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watchdog Role 
</P>
<P>
Under the state law establishing such landscape maintenance districts, the city 
acts as a watchdog to ensure that developers install landscaping, which the 
city subsequently maintains. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a report on the district's finances and operations requested by the 
City Council, City Engineer Harry W. Thomas recommended Monday that the city 
disband the district and turn the responsibility over to a homeowners 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
While such a plan would be less than perfect, Thomas said, a resident-operated 
district could operate more economically and remove the city from its 
administrative role. 
</P>
<P>
The council took no action on the report but set an Aug. 7 hearing date, where 
Thomas' recommendation and the homeowners' concerns will be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Barbagallo criticized the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"The city staff has recommended that you abandon the district," he told the 
council. "We have been paying taxes for nine years . . . for you to abandon us 
now would be in poor faith." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
240 Acres 
</P>
<P>
Barbagallo's neighborhood consists of 240 acres of upscale, hillside homes near 
the intersection of Cameron and Grand avenues. The area is supposed to have 91 
acres of "common open space" that would have six acres of landscaping. The rest 
of the land is to remain in an almost natural state, with only fire prevention 
and minimal maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has acknowledged that progress on the portion that is to be landscaped 
has been slowed by "less than satisfactory" efforts from a succession of home 
developers, poor plant choices that did not take root and bad weather 
conditions. He estimated that the work could be completed in the next 14 
months. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing city records, Barbagallo claims that the city has not lived up 
to its responsibility in the natural area, providing no brush removal or fire 
protection measures. Instead, he alleges, the city has used the money to 
support programs outside the district and pay the salaries of city employees 
having minimal connection to the district. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's auditor, McGladrey &amp; Pullen, conducted a review of the 
maintenance district's financial operations, concluding that "it appears that 
the type of expenditures that the district has incurred is in compliance with 
the (state) act." 
</P>
<P>
As of May, the city had collected $628,493 from the district, at least 60% of 
which was paid by developers, according to Thomas' report, which included the 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effort Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Of the $375,430 spent by the district, $184,675 was used for employee salaries 
and benefits, $35,223 went to consultants, $14,197 went to service contracts, 
$18,607 was spent on materials and services, $88,916 for administrative costs 
and $33,812 for capital improvements. A reserve fund intended for emergencies, 
such as landslides, contains $253,063, according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the audit's conclusions, resident Marc S. Lafer questioned the city's 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"What has been done for that money," he asked. "What does the city of West 
Covina have to show for that $650,000." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Thomas proposed four options but recommended disbanding the 
assessment district. One option was to continue the current practice but remit 
interest income to residents who live in the district by lowering the $650 
annual assessments by as much $100. 
</P>
<P>
Two other proposals would either reduce or eliminate the contingency fund but 
would put the city's general fund at risk in case of a large landslide, he 
said. Also, homeowners could be hit with large assessments the year after a 
slide to reimburse the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Establishing a homeowners group would reduce the annual maintenance costs by as 
much as 30% because of decreased administrative costs, according to Thomas. 
Homeowners would have total control over the level of service provided. 
</P>
<P>
But he also noted several disadvantages. Such organizations lack the expertise 
of city engineers and the flexibility to respond to emergencies, such as 
landslides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said his suggestion was an attempt to give the residents what they want 
and balance that with the city's desire to see the area maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Lafer said the recommendation to disband the district was an attempt by the 
city staff to punish residents. "To me, that just rings of retaliation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have been collecting taxes since 1980-81, and all the time 
they've taxed they have not done anything for it," he said. "We don't think 
we're radicals; we just want to get what we're paying for."

DOWNEY EXTENDS PILOT DAY-CARE SERVICE

<P>
A pilot program of extended day care that began this spring at Imperial 
Elementary School has been extended for another year by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The city funded staff positions and nutritional, recreational and tutorial 
supplies for the extended-care program at Imperial, Downey's largest elementary 
school, 
</P>
<P>
Downey School Board President Margo Hoffer said affordable child care is also 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a need for low-cost child care. These are not families that 
are using the YMCA. Hopefully we will keep it and extend it to other schools," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Randall Barb said: "I still believe the program is better in the 
hands of the school board and not us." 
</P>
<P>
Community Services Director Jim Jarrett said about 24 children made use of the 
after-school care. Fees ranged from $12 to $22 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrett said attendance in the program is growing each week, and he expects to 
have 50 openings available in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Children in kindergarten through fifth grade were offered the extended care. 
They were escorted to the school library after dismissal of regular school. 
There they completed homework assignments, read, and played cards and other 
quiet games. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 study conducted by United Way, entitled "School is Out in L.A.," noted 
that Downey had a need for 2,225 spaces for care of the children, but there was 
only room for about 300 children in the five centers in the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Social Services Manager Alta Duke, who as committee member reported to the 
council on the benefits of the program in its early stage, said Downey has many 
private day-care facilities, but there is a need for more extended day-care 
services.

16 TEAMS FROM VALLEY WILL COMPETE IN L.A. GAMES BASKETBALL COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley will be well-represented when high school players from 
throughout the Southland compete in the 22nd L.A. Games Men's Basketball 
Competition that starts Saturday at sites throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen teams from the valley will compete in the 128-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Among the valley's top teams are Pasadena, Muir, Glendora and Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In first-round games Saturday, Glendora takes on South Gate at 10 a.m. at El 
Camino College, Pasadena meets Bell Gardens at 2 p.m. at Hamilton High, Muir 
faces Newbury Park at 3 at Hamilton and Pomona plays Burbank at 4 at Dorsey 
High. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a new-look Glendora team that faces South Gate. The Tartans will be 
playing without All-American forward Tracy Murray, who graduated after 
averaging a state-record 44.3 points a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
But Glendora, which finished 31-3 and reached the state Division II final last 
season, has seven of its top nine players returning, including forwards J. J. 
O'Laughlin (6-3) and Jay Zuhlke (6-5) and guard Chris Walker (5-10). O'Laughlin 
averaged 9.1 points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona figures to be strong with 6-5 forward Johnny McWilliams, who averaged 
24.2 points and 12.2 rebounds as a sophomore and earned All-Southern Section 
honors. The Red Devils finished at 16-10 and reached the second round of the 
Southern Section 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena is coming off an outstanding season, finishing 24-3 and reaching the 
Southern Section 5-A semifinals. The Bulldogs appear talented again with 6-2 
swing man Don Mitchell, who averaged 13.6 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
Muir posted one of its worst records in recent years at 10-12 and missed the 
Southern Section playoffs. But the Mustangs, who started three sophomores, are 
expected to rebound behind returning junior forwards LaDay Smith (6-5) and Erid 
Scott (6-6). 
</P>
<P>
Other first-round games Saturday include Ganesha at L.A. Jordan at 9 a.m., La 
Salle vs. Carson at 9 at El Camino, Blair at Hamilton at 9, Keppel vs. Monroe 
at 10 at Fremont High, Diamond Bar vs. Locke at 11 at El Camino, Alhambra vs. 
Chadwick at 11 at Hamilton, Duarte vs. Verbum Dei at 11 at El Camino, Bosco 
Tech vs. Pius X at noon at Jordan, Walnut vs. Crespi at 1 p.m. at Banning High, 
Temple City vs. Miraleste at 2 at Crenshaw High, and Charter Oak vs. Grant at 3 
and South Pasadena vs. Santa Barbara at 4 at Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The favorites are Manual Arts, Saddleback, Mater Dei and Cleveland. Manual Arts 
is the top seed. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary rounds will be played Saturday and Sunday. Survivors will square 
off June 24 and 25 at El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
After struggling last season, the Cal State Los Angeles men's tennis team has 
added a top junior college performer for next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles, who finished 0-10 in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. and 3-17 overall, have signed Ed Peregrino from Saddleback College to a 
letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Peregrino, who will be a junior, won the state community college men's singles 
championship and was ranked No. 1 in the state in singles and doubles by the 
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Assn.. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been talking to Ed about coming here for about a year and a half," Golden 
Eagle Coach Ed Charles said. "I think he can be a strong, strong player for us 
-- perhaps even our No. 1 player next spring." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Looker, who coached Citrus College of Glendora to a 19-7 record and the 
Foothill Conference championship in women's basketball last season, has been 
named women's basketball coach at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Looker, a standout as a player at Cal Poly Pomona from 1980-84, was an 
assistant at Citrus two seasons ago and was coach of Rowland High in 1985. She 
was also selected Foothill Conference Coach of the Year last season. 
</P>
<P>
She will take over a Mt. Sac team that has struggled to records of 12-18 in the 
1987-88 season and 10-19 last season. But Looker has high hopes for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to improve," Looker said. "In the long run, it has the potential to 
win league and do well in state competition." 
</P>
<P>
Looker expects to improve the Mounties through recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
Former Los Angeles Rams defensive lineman Doug Barnett has been named women's 
softball coach at Azusa Pacific University. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, 29, replaces Laura Wood, who resigned to pursue other opportunities in 
her home state of Washington. With Wood as coach, the Cougars posted a 64-57 
record the last four seasons and were 16-18 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, who has been an assistant football coach at Azusa Pacific and will 
remain in that position, competed in football and track for the Cougars in 
1978-82. He played for the Rams in 1982 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Ten high schools from the San Gabriel Valley have been selected as winners of 
1988-89 CIF Southern Section sportsmanship awards. 
</P>
<P>
The schools are Maranatha of Sierra Madre, Glendora, Calvary Baptist of La 
Verne, San Gabriel, San Gabriel Mission, El Monte, Muir of Pasadena, Monrovia, 
Baldwin Park and Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one schools were honored.

TAR-PIT BONES REVEAL AILMENTS OF EXTINCT SABER-TOOTH CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists at the La Brea tar pits are studying the illnesses and injuries that 
plagued a creature extinct for at least 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Staff and volunteer paleopathologists at the George C. Page Museum are 
cataloguing the ills that the saber-toothed cat fell prey to. Knowing what went 
wrong with the long-vanished cats, incorrectly called tigers by earlier 
researchers, has no obvious utility. But it provides intriguing clues to how 
they lived in sickness and in health. 
</P>
<P>
The Page Museum in Hancock Park houses the fossils of countless animals and 
plants that were trapped in the area's tar pits, vast deposits of asphalt that 
continues to seep to the surface and scent the park. Between 10,000 and 40,000 
years ago, giant mammoths, dire wolves and hundreds of other Ice Age species 
were trapped in the asphalt deposits like flies on flypaper. Their remains, 
preserved by the substance that killed them, constitute one of the greatest 
caches of Ice Age fossils in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5,000 Injured Bones 
</P>
<P>
Fred P. Heald, 75, a retired surgeon who lives in Palos Verdes Estates, assumed 
the daunting task of putting the museum's 75-year-old collection of diseased 
and traumatized bones in order. 
</P>
<P>
"Paleopathology," the volunteer explained, "is the study of diseases and 
injuries present in fossil specimens." Among the 500,000 specimens in the 
museum's vast ossuary are some 5,000 saber-toothed cat bones that show evidence 
of everything from arthritis to infection with the fungus that causes Valley 
fever to a half-broken neck. (The pathology collection includes 4,000 dire wolf 
bones as well.) 
</P>
<P>
"I started out at one end of the collection and worked clear through, bone by 
bone," recalled Heald, who jotted his description and diagnosis of each 
specimen on an index card. 
</P>
<P>
Heald learned about Smilodon californicus, as the saber-tooth is properly 
called, as he went along. "Nobody has ever written a textbook on the anatomy 
and pathology of a Smilodon cat," he said, "but, fortunately, all animals are 
hooked up pretty much the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Heald was delighted to discover that, anatomically at least, the saber-tooth 
responded to illness and injury much as humans do. Working with museum staffer 
Christopher A. Shaw, who is interested in the relationship of physical form to 
function, Heald can make intelligent guesses about how the cats brought down 
their prey and even about their social organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Animal 
</P>
<P>
"I sat for four or five hours a day, just writing down what I saw," Heald 
recalled. "Out of the trees came a little better view of the forest." 
</P>
<P>
The scientists are convinced by the asphalt-blackened bones that the 
saber-toothed cat was a social animal that hunted with others in a pack or 
pride. As Heald explained, the bones show evidence of wounds, fractures and 
dislocations disabling enough to have caused death if the animal had been a 
solitary hunter. 
</P>
<P>
But from clues such as broken sabers worn smooth over time, the scientists know 
that even some cats that had lost their characteristic canine teeth lived with 
their disabilities for a considerable period before their sticky demise in the 
tar pits. No longer able to kill for themselves, the cats probably lived on the 
scraps of kills made by others in the group, the men speculate. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw noted that a modern observer can't help but wince at some of the maladies 
reflected in the collection, such as a hip that shows evidence of a massive 
infection, which must have caused the animal considerable pain. "I sit there 
and think, 'How did this guy get around?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pathological or not, the museum's bones are remarkably eloquent. Page Museum 
staffer Antonia Tejada-Flores found evidence that the saber-tooth roared when 
she came across a cigar box full of fossilized throat bones called hyoids. The 
hyoids of the saber-tooth had relatively elastic connections, similar to those 
of contemporary cats that roar. Non-roaring cats have relatively inflexible 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Former museum staffer William A. Akersten found other bones to bolster his 
theory that the cats used their sabers, not primarily to stab or slash, but to 
execute a calamitous shearing bite to soft parts of their prey, which then bled 
to death or died of shock. 
</P>
<P>
As Shaw pointed out, the saber-toothed cat is an especially intriguing animal 
"because there's nothing like them around today. It's fascinating to see what 
made them go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stealth Hunter 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of their bones, the scientists believe the cat was a stealth 
hunter. "It's not a fast animal like a cheetah," said the 37-year-old Shaw, a 
Granada Hills resident who is the museum's curator of collections. "The tail is 
the biggest clue. Animals that run down their prey generally have a large tail 
for balance. The Smilodon had a very short tail." 
</P>
<P>
In a scientific paper, Heald praised bone as an expressive medium. "Living 
bone," he wrote, "is not a hard, unyielding material that holds animals 
together. Bone is dynamic, it responds to use and especially to misuse. It has 
quite set ways of growing and of healing itself after injury which are common 
to all animals." 
</P>
<P>
Heald explained that when an animal's muscles are stressed, little tears occur. 
There is bleeding, and then telltale calluses form on the bone. Many of the 
cats in the collection sustained terrible, repeated stress injuries to their 
necks and backs that cause the scientists to speculate that the saber-tooth 
cats leaped on large prey with great force. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery in a Texas cave of another kind of saber-tooth surrounded by the 
bones of young mastodons and mammoths leads the men to believe juvenile 
elephants were probably a Smilodon foodstuff. Without the cats, Heald 
theorized, "the world would have been clear up to its eyes in elephants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lions Kill Large Prey 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, Heald and others using the paleopathology collection are aware that, 
however logical their theories about what the saber-tooth did, no one will ever 
know for sure if they are right. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Shaw noted, the museum staff thought the saber-tooth's largest 
front toe was probably toward the middle of its paw, like a modern lion's. But 
the recent find of an almost complete saber-tooth skeleton in the tar pits, 
with its bones in place, reveals that the big toes were across from each other 
on the inside of the paws -- in the same position as human toes.

LOSS OF SIGHT AND HEARING FAIL TO SLOW THE COMPETITIVE DRIVE OF RIO MESA'S 
CASEY COOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kathy Cook recalls vividly the day she looked out the kitchen window and saw 
her youngest son, Casey, hurtling out of control down the driveway toward the 
street on his sister's bicycle. A moment of panic for any parent. 
</P>
<P>
A bit more so when your son is blind. 
</P>
<P>
"He went quite a way before he rammed into a parked car," she said. "And then 
it was off to the emergency room of the hospital. Again. Casey has been in more 
hospital emergency rooms than I can remember." 
</P>
<P>
Cook laughs as the story is relayed to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've given my parents a scare or two," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Angie Weatherford, a very young-looking 33, recalls the first time she met 
Cook. 
</P>
<P>
"People always say that they can't believe I'm 33," she said. "People tell me 
all the time they figure I'm about 25. And after spending a few hours with 
Casey, he asked me how old I was. When I told him, he said, 'C'mon. I thought 
you were about 25.' He picked it up right away." 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad show of perceptiveness for a blind kid. 
</P>
<P>
But a bit more remarkable when you know that Cook is also deaf. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just astounded," said Weatherford, who works as Cook's sign-language 
interpreter. "I've worked with kids with these handicaps before, and I just 
couldn't figure it out. He couldn't see me and he couldn't hear my voice, and 
yet he responded to me exactly the way everyone else does. I was just shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Cook, 17, said he had made the assumption that Weatherford was only in her 20s 
because of the energy she showed as she conversed with him in a special 
hand-in-hand code. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the day I realized that Casey Cook is somebody very special," 
Weatherford said. 
</P>
<P>
Special. Remarkable. Rare. You hear those words often from the friends and 
family of Cook. He insists that he wants no special treatment, does not want to 
be singled out for any praise. He just wants to be one of the guys at Rio Mesa 
High, where he has run track and cross-country, wrestled for the varsity and 
now is one of the school's best swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as he doesn't want any special attention, he will always stand out," 
Weatherford said. "He'll stand out because he's such a rare, rare breed. He has 
such a tremendous drive and focus on what he wants to do. He has such 
determination." 
</P>
<P>
Cook's athletic accomplishments include: 
</P>
<P>
A victory in the 3,000-meter run in the 1988 Northern California Championships 
for Blind Athletes; 
</P>
<P>
Six gold medals and three silvers in swimming in the 1988 U. S. Blind Athletic 
Assn. Summer Nationals in Indianapolis; 
</P>
<P>
A bronze medal in swimming in the 1988 Paralympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
This week he is in Cape Girardeau, Mo., to swim in the USBAA's 12-sport, 
seven-day Summer National Championships. 
</P>
<P>
But his real accomplishments are in his daily life in a silent and dark world. 
Cook, however, has made a steely commitment not just to get through life, but 
to embrace it and take from it all it can give. 
</P>
<P>
The Cooks' oldest son, Chris, 25, is also blind and deaf. His condition was 
caused by Vogt-Koyanagi Syndrome, also known as Ocular Cutaneous Syndrome, an 
extremely rare and incurable disease that only afflicts males and ultimately 
causes blindness through detachment of the retinas, and later, deafness. 
</P>
<P>
The first symptoms were dozens of white, snowflake-like spots of rapidly dying 
tissue that appeared on Chris Cook's eyes at the age of 1 and robbed him of his 
sight and his hearing. Doctors assured the Cooks that the disease was not 
genetically transmittable, and they continued to build a family. Two daughters 
followed, then Casey was born in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
With the assurance of specialists, the Cooks began raising their new infant, 
fully expecting a healthy boy to grow into a healthy man. 
</P>
<P>
"But one morning, around his first birthday, I went in to wake him up and I saw 
the white spots," Kathy Cook said. "Exactly the same white spots on the eyes 
that Chris had at the same age. It happened, literally, overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't quite believe it. In the years since, every doctor we have talked 
with has said this is the only case they know of with two members of the same 
family being afflicted." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the light went out of Casey's world. By the age of 8 he was blind. 
And then his hearing began to diminish, finally dissolving to total deafness 
last year. He spent several years at the California School for the Blind in 
Fremont and eventually worked himself into a regular curriculum at a Fremont 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
And last fall, Cook came home and enrolled at Rio Mesa. The Oxnard Union High 
School District located Weatherford and hired her to be Cook's eyes, ears and 
companion. She sits beside him in class, relaying the teacher's words through 
the intricate system called tactile signing, in which she taps out the symbols 
for the words into the palms of Cook's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The system is so precise that even the subtle nuances of the English language 
are relayed to Cook, complete with laughter and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
And, because his hearing loss became total only in the past 18 months, Cook 
speaks in a strong and clear voice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't miss my vision that much," he said, "but I do miss my hearing. After I 
lost my sight, my hearing became so important to me. And now, that's gone, too. 
I miss being able to listen to music. And I miss hearing my friends." 
</P>
<P>
Cook's father, Ron, played baseball at USC from 1962-66 and Casey grew up in an 
active sports family. Cook said that his decision to participate in sports was 
a natural one. He never considered not playing sports. 
</P>
<P>
"I was willing to try anything," he said. "Skateboarding and wrestling and 
running track and cross-country and riding a bike and even windsurfing. But 
swimming was always the sport I enjoyed most. And that's because it's a sport 
that I don't need any help in doing. Just get me into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I ran cross-country how much I enjoyed it. But I needed a 
guide to run with and I always heard the whispers from the other kids. I could 
hear them sneaking off when it was time to practice or race and overhearing 
them saying how they didn't want to 'have to run with that blind kid again.' I 
just got tired of all that." 
</P>
<P>
In the pool, his mother or father or swimming Coach Sandy Nielson-Bell, who was 
a member of the U. S. Olympic swim team in 1972, follows Casey from one end of 
the pool to the other with a tennis ball attached to a pole. When he nears the 
end of a lap, he is tapped on the head with the tennis ball and immediately 
goes into a flip-turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I lose about a half-second on each turn over sighted people," he said, 
"but it's not so bad that I can't compete with them. It does make a difference, 
but I can overcome the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part about swimming blind is just swimming. Swimming is a very 
hard sport." 
</P>
<P>
He swims upward of 6,000 yards a day at the Pleasant Valley Swim Club pool in 
Camarillo and considers the 200-meter breaststroke his strongest event. Cook, 
who will complete his sophomore year at Rio Mesa this month, said that he hopes 
to improve his swimming skills enough to compete in college in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason I can't," he said, "if I work hard enough at it." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, there are other goals. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I think about all my friends getting their driver's licenses and 
zooming around in their cars," he said. "Someday I'd like to walk out of the 
house, jump in the car and zoom on over to a friend's house." 
</P>
<P>
At this, Kathy Cook's eyebrows rise dramatically. She recalls her son flying 
down the driveway on a bike and slamming into the parked car. And now he's 
talking about driving a car? 
</P>
<P>
The eyebrows fall now and Kathy Cook smiles at her son. The day that he stops 
thinking about new things to do, about new adventures and new challenges and 
the day that he stops dreaming, then she will worry. 
</P>
<P>
"When I meet people," Casey Cook said, "I can sense immediately what they are 
thinking and feeling. I can tell that most people are trying to figure me out, 
as though they are examining a person from another planet. I can sense that 
strangeness when they meet me.

ANDERSON EXCELLED IN DUAL ROLE FOR BUENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the postseason awards have been rolling in nonstop, baseball season is 
hardly over for Matt Anderson of Buena High. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who pitched 51 innings for the Channel League-champion Bulldogs, 
expects to throw at least another 50 innings before his season ends. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who was drafted and signed by the Baltimore Orioles last week, has 
been assigned to pitch for the Bluefield Orioles, in Bluefield, W. Va. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie team is composed primarily of recently drafted high school and 
junior college graduates and competes in the Appalachian League. The season 
begins next week and runs through late August. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson will make his first trip away from home Sunday when he flies to 
Bluefield. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait. I'm really excited," Anderson said. "I need to get out and get a 
chance to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orioles promised that I would move right into their rookie team's starting 
rotation." 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander posted a 7-1 record and 1.49 earned-run average while leading 
the Bulldogs to the Southern Section 4-A Division quarterfinals where they lost 
to Hart, 10-7. Anderson, troubled by a sore elbow, allowed five runs in two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was also among Ventura County leaders in batting average (.465), 
doubles (7), triples (3), home runs (7) and runs batted in (31). 
</P>
<P>
He signed a letter of intent with Cal State Northridge and was prepared to 
continue his career at the college level. Matt's older brother Mark played at 
Northridge and in 1984 helped the Matadors win a Division II national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Matt planned to follow in Mark's footsteps until Baltimore made him the first 
pick of the fifth round June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Matt's father, Bud Anderson, wanted him to earn a college degree before 
pursuing a professional career. Bud's baseball career ended after four season 
in the Boston Red Sox minor league system. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a pessimistic attitude that I would never sign with Orioles," Anderson 
said. "I didn't think the Orioles would offer me enough money where I would be 
willing to give up my scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, however, made a favorable impression last Wednesday by offering a 
signing bonus, a trust fund toward a college education and a chance to pitch 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like the right thing to do," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson would not disclose the amount of his signing bonus, but it is believed 
to be in the $50,000 range. Anderson did say that he received $20,000 to be put 
in a trust fund toward a college education after he leaves baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"We think he's good enough to go all the way and play in the majors," Bud 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the Orioles believe so, too.

JOHNSON, MADSEN DECIDE TO JOIN BASEBALL CAST AT VENTURA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Gary Anglin expected to lure some top high school baseball recruits to 
Ventura College after the Pirates capped their best season in 15 years by 
winning the Western State Conference title and advancing to the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Not even Anglin, however, expected his recruiting to go so well so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Both John Johnson of Channel Islands and Danny Madsen of Newbury Park are 
expected to play for Anglin next season. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who hit .383 with five home runs at Channel Islands, was a low-round 
draft choice of the Seattle Mariners on June 5 but has opted to attend Ventura, 
where he expects to play both football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Madsen was a low-round choice of the Texas Rangers, but he also plans to attend 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who did not score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, has been 
promised a football scholarship to Arizona if he plays football and completes 
two years at Ventura.

AGENT'S REPUTATION IS BUILT ON FAIR PLAY; 
</P>
<P>
'LUCKIEST GUY IN THE WORLD' HAS LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD NAMED AFTER HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Why don't sharks eat Hollywood agents? 
</P>
<P>
Professional courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
That's an old joke in Hollywood, where agents are perceived as only slightly 
more sensitive and moral than producers. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, not every agent fits the profile. There is one out there who 
actually gives agents a good name. Jack Gilardi of Beverly Hills is probably 
the only agent who has had a Little League field named after him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not your average Hollywood agent," said O. J. Simpson, who has been 
represented by Gilardi for 17 years on nothing but a handshake. "He's almost 
like a camp counselor." 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi is a senior agent at International Creative Management with a client 
list that ranges from Joan Collins and Faye Dunaway to the Fat Boys and Don 
Rickles. He goes to church. He raises thousands of dollars for charity. He 
loves kids. He returns phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack is a class guy, a man well-loved in his profession," said Dodgers Manager 
Tommy Lasorda, who has been friends for years with Gilardi. For 26 years, 
Gilardi and producer Joe Siegman -- Gilardi gets the celebrities, Siegman 
writes the gags -- has run the annual Hollywood Stars Night at Dodger Stadium, 
which benefits the Motion Picture Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
There's a black-and-white photo of Lasorda and Gilardi in Gilardi's cozy office 
on the seventh floor of the ICM building in West Los Angeles. Overlooking the 
Hollywood Hills, the office is filled with antique furniture, but the dominant 
feature is a collection of National Football League helmets. There is also 
enough sports memorabilia to start a museum: boxing gloves, baseball caps, 
score cards, an engraved bat given to him by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi, who's about 50 (he won't give his exact age), has thick brown hair 
swept straight back and a wiry, athletic build. He is a man with a reputation 
for fair play and honesty in a cutthroat profession. He hangs out with sports 
legends and Hollywood icons. He was married "for 18 wonderful years" to Annette 
Funicello, one of the original Mouseketeers who is still his client, and they 
have three children. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Gilardi says, "I'm the luckiest guy in the world." 
</P>
<P>
A second-generation Italian-American, Gilardi wanted to be a doctor when he was 
growing up in Chicago. So instead of taking a baseball scholarship to Notre 
Dame or Illinois, he attended Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, a small Catholic 
school that didn't even have a baseball team. But his medical career ended when 
he "ran into organic chemistry -- or it ran into me." He graduated with a 
degree in business and was drafted into the Army for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Stationed at Ft. Knox, Ky., he got the break of a lifetime. As a private, he 
was assigned to book entertainment -- Duke Ellington, Ray Anthony -- on the 
base, giving him a show business education and innumerable connections. 
Discharged from the service, he was offered jobs with three big entertainment 
agencies in the Midwest. But William Morris wanted him to start as a typist and 
the Music Corp. of America wanted him to wrap band posters in the publicity 
department. Only General Artists Corp. said it would hire him as an agent. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't even know what an agent did," Gilardi said. 
</P>
<P>
He learned fast. In 1958, GAC -- the forerunner of ICM -- transferred him to 
Los Angeles and put him in charge of the "cocktail department," meaning that he 
represented talent that performed in local nightclubs such as the Melody Room 
on Sunset Strip. In two years, he was running the agency's entire West Coast 
nightclub department, a territory that included Las Vegas and Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Gilardi was spending a lot of leisure hours at P.J.s, a West 
Hollywood club. Gilardi hung out with teen idol Frankie Avalon and Harvey 
Lembeck, the comic actor who played Cpl. Rocco Barbella alongside Phil Silvers' 
Sgt. Ernie Bilko on television's "The Phil Silvers Show." They began playing 
pickup softball games at Roxbury Park against a team that included comedians 
Buddy Hackett and Shecky Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I got calls from other people in the business who wanted to 
play games against us," Gilardi recalls. Before Gilardi knew it, he was 
commissioner of the Hollywood Entertainment League, which became a major part 
of the industry's social whirl. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the major stars of the early '60s had teams. There were Jerry Lewis' 
Clowns and Dean Martin's Dinos, James Garner's Gems and Pat Boone's Boones. 
Producers Aaron Spelling and David Wolper played. So did Jack Nicholson, Bobby 
Darin, Burt Reynolds and the Nelson boys, David and Ricky. Gilardi played on 
the United Jewish Italians, which was sponsored by a Union 76 station. 
</P>
<P>
After the league started up, Gilardi began dating Funicello. They married, and 
when their first child, Gina, was born in 1965, Annette began showing up at 
softball games pushing a baby carriage. But by the mid-'60s, the league began 
to change. Teams were bringing in ringers, circumventing a rule that limited 
rosters to players who worked in the entertainment industry. And when the 
caliber of play increased, the stars began to lose their enthusiasm. "Some of 
them couldn't compete that heavily," Gilardi said. "They just weren't that 
good." 
</P>
<P>
By the late '60s, Gilardi was spending his time with his young family and his 
burgeoning business and could no longer devote a lot of energy to running a 
10-team league, so in 1969 he announced his retirement as commissioner. The 
league went on for another year before it folded. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else was willing to take on total responsibility," Gilardi said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi's involvement with the Hollywood Stars began in 1963. One of his 
clients was Nat King Cole, who had been captain and organizer of a celebrity 
team and asked Gilardi to take it over for him. Gilardi enlisted the help of 
Siegman, who had moved from Chicago. Today, comedian Billy Crystal is captain 
of one team and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar heads another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big deal to a lot of the stars," said Gilardi, who keeps a photo of 
Funicello standing in the shadows of Abdul-Jabbar. "You can't book Billy 
Crystal when there's a game. He'll block off those days." 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Gilardi, who lived in Encino, signed up his son Jackie, then 8, in the 
Encino Little League. Five years later, his youngest son, Jason, began playing. 
Gilardi managed their teams. He got Annette to staff the snack stand and 
Simpson to throw out the first ball. He was league president for a year. And 
aside from being the most popular manager, said former league President Bernie 
Paperny, Gilardi raised about $200,000 for the league. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the backbone of all fund raising," said Paperny. "He worked countless 
hours and asked nothing in exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Katofsky another former league president, remembers Gilardi's ability to 
elicit donations for the league's fund-raisers. "He even had a boat donated 
that we sold at an auction," Katofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi has had a close relationship with the players, Paperny said. "He was 
like a father to all of them and made them feel good about themselves. 
Everybody wanted to play on his team. One year the kids elected him to manage 
the all-star team with 95% of the votes." 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi did not allow parents to meddle, Katofsky said, and winning was not as 
important as the players' personal growth. "If his players lost, they had to be 
good sports," Katofsky said. "All he demanded of them was that they do their 
best and try hard." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Katofsky led a movement to name the main field at the Encino Little 
League complex after Gilardi. The announcement, made at a league banquet at the 
Sheraton Universal hotel, "was a complete surprise," Gilardi said. A photo 
above his office desk shows him standing on the field by a sign that reads: 
"Gilardi Field -- in honor of Jack Gilardi -- for his dedication to Encino 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi's largess and his extensive contacts have made him an easy touch -- 
he's known as the man to see for hard-to-get tickets to sports events and 
concerts. He even arranged a private tour of the Vatican for an associate. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack truly likes to help people," Siegman said, "and he's helped out an 
enormous number of people." 
</P>
<P>
But Gilardi will call in an IOU. "For every favor you ask, you have to give 
back two," he says. "So you better consider which one you ask for." 
</P>
<P>
In his office, Gilardi points to another photo on his wall, taken about 14 
years ago. The ICM softball team is playing archrival William Morris. There's a 
brawl going on. Players are squared off. Except for one. "That's me," Gilardi 
said, "trying to break up the fight." 
</P>
<P>
And blow a chance to go for the jugular. No, Gilardi is not your average 
Hollywood agent.

UCLA IDENTIFIES A MAJOR SOURCE OF POLLUTION -- ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It generates 1 to 2 million gallons of sewage each day, as much as a mammoth 
shopping center or a small town. It uses $4.5 million worth of paper products 
each year, including thousands of tons of toilet paper and computer printouts. 
All told annually, it creates an estimated 15,000 tons of solid waste, 800 tons 
of medical waste and 100 tons of hazardous waste such as asbestos, poisons and 
explosive chemicals. In addition, as one of the state's largest licensed 
research facilities, it is among the largest disposers of radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
This is not some sooty factory in the bowels of Los Angeles. It is a reknowned 
educational institution, located on 411 attractive acres -- the University of 
California at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
According to an unusual study to be released Friday by UCLA's Graduate School 
of Architecture and Urban Planning, the bustling campus -- six miles from the 
Pacific Ocean and 12 miles from downtown Los Angeles -- may be the source of 
some of the region's worst pollution and waste. 
</P>
<P>
The 500-page study, the most comprehensive environmental assessment ever made 
of a major metropolitan university, has already piqued the interest of a number 
of California lawmakers, among them Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los 
Angeles), in whose district UCLA is located. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exempt From Regulations 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the legislative interest is that universities have 
historically been exempt from many of the environmental regulations and 
policies that govern private industry. 
</P>
<P>
The study also affords a glimpse of the huge impact that a single institution 
can have on the surrounding community. But just as UCLA, its employees and its 
students have been partly responsible for Los Angeles' environmental problems, 
so too can they begin to solve some of them, the study argues. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the lush lawns and gardens and the sparkling smiles of tanned 
students, it is hard to believe that this university is a major polluter. 
</P>
<P>
But the Westwood campus is the city's third-largest user of electricity, the 
eighth-largest consumer of water, the 10th-largest producer of carbon monoxide, 
the study shows. UCLA runs a fleet of cars so large that it is surpassed only 
by Chevron and Disneyland in the amount of air pollution it brings to Southern 
California, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
If the study paints a disturbing picture of a wanton polluter, that is 
precisely what it was intended to do, said Robert Gottlieb, an adjunct lecturer 
at UCLA and faculty adviser to the six graduate students who researched and 
wrote the study. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not mean to imply that UCLA is a worse polluter than other universities 
and certainly not than some industries. But it certainly plays a role," 
Gottlieb said. "The purpose of the study is to show, as graphically as 
possible, what that role is and . . . how a university like UCLA, with all of 
its intellectual and scientific resources, is uniquely positioned to start 
solving some of the nation's most complex environmental problems." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the study's proposed solutions are anything but complex. 
</P>
<P>
One way to cut down on waste, the study says, is to encourage more students and 
campus employees to purchase permanent coffee mugs instead of buying disposable 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Making photocopies on both sides of a sheet of paper can also result in 
tremendous savings, as can the replacement of campus mail envelopes, designed 
for one-time use only, with reusable mail folders. 
</P>
<P>
The university's approach to solid waste management is typical of large 
institutions: It is considered a "disposal" problem, rather than a matter of 
conserving or recycling materials, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Campuswide Policy 
</P>
<P>
While a few voluntary recycling programs have sprung up over the last decade, 
the university has never established a campuswide policy on recycling wastes. 
</P>
<P>
The report contains some "very good" and "very interesting" ideas, said Allen 
Solomon, UCLA's assistant vice chancellor for facilities management. "I think 
we (the administration) will take this report . . . very seriously at UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, UCLA has been sensitive to the environment, according to the 
study. The chemistry department has sought ways to cut down on the use of 
chemicals and other materials in experiments, but its innovations have yet to 
be adopted by other departments. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has won numerous awards for its ride-sharing program, a project 
established four years ago to cut down on the traffic on campus during the 
Olympics. At the same time, the study says, the university continues to build 
parking structures and discourages few employees from bringing their cars. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, the university has not been progressive enough in its thinking, 
the study says. 
</P>
<P>
Public universities, like government agencies and the military, are not subject 
to many of the anti-pollution regulations that affect private industry. UCLA, 
instead of always pushing for tougher standards, has sometimes worked hard to 
keep itself as free of as many regulations as possible, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Issue 
</P>
<P>
Take sewage, which has become a particularly difficult issue for Los Angeles 
with its rapidly growing population and outmoded treatment facilities. Instead 
of trying to help solve the problem, UCLA has tried to remain exempt from 
recent city ordinances intended to stave off the crisis, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Environmental Protection Agency estimates that universities 
generate less than 1% of the nation's hazardous wastes but the wastes are so 
varied in nature and found all over campus -- chemistry laboratories, art 
studios, maintenance shops and other facilities -- that they should be of 
particular concern to the university, the study maintains. In other areas, the 
study says, UCLA has been slow to react to environmental problems simply 
because its priorities lie elsewhere. This is particularly evident when it 
comes to campus aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
The university administration has been so sensitive to preserving and enhancing 
the look of the grounds that it has not always been willing to make changes 
that are environmentally sound, the study says. Instead of growing desert 
vegetation, which would use less water and be more suitable to the climate of 
Southern California, the campus has been filled with palm trees and magnolias 
and rolling acres of lush, green grass -- all requiring vast amounts of water. 
</P>
<P>
One solution, the report suggests, is for the university to begin recycling 
some of its own sewage to water its lawns and plants. Similarly, the snack bars 
and cafeterias on campus might consider using what amounts to millions of 
pounds of discarded food as composts in place of chemical fertilizers and soil 
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some May Be Impractical 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the suggestions are worthy of exploration, others are at best 
controversial and may be impractical, Vice Chancellor Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
The reuse of sewage for watering plants is an issue that has been hotly debated 
by experts for years, Solomon said. "Do we want to treat lawns with untreated 
water or treated sewage when kids lie on the lawns? I think that's one we have 
to think about." 
</P>
<P>
As for composting the wasted food from campus eateries, "that's a potentially 
helpful solution to a waste problem, but it may create a new issue of pest 
control," Solomon warned. 
</P>
<P>
The students say that they hope there will be annual updates of their study and 
that eventually the entire university system, including Berkeley and the other 
campuses of the UC system, will follow UCLA's lead in studying the environment 
and trying to improve it. 
</P>
<P>
Titled, "In Our Backyard: Environmental Problems at UCLA, Proposals for Change 
and the Institution's Potential as a Model," the study was written by Tamra 
Brink, Jennifer Dill, Gretchen Homblad, Bryce Little, Anita Adun and April 
Smith.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HONORED FOR 'SKINHEAD' RESCUE

A man was honored Wednesday for coming to the rescue of an Iranian couple who 
were attacked by a group of neo-Nazi "skinheads" who mistakenly believed that 
their victims were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Washington, 34, of Pomona, was presented with a distinguished service 
award by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Washington intervened in the May 28 attack on the Iranian couple, who had their 
baby with them in a shopping center parking lot in La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
The reputed neo-Nazi skinheads, three men and a woman, face charges of assault 
and for allegedly violating the victims' civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"A citizen stepped forward in a situation where there was clearly an attack on 
a couple and their infant child that was motivated by racial hatred," the 
Wiesenthal center's Rabbi Abraham Cooper said of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Of the honor, Washington, a school security officer, said, "It's kind of a 
strange feeling for me. I really didn't expect this much to be made of it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JAIL INFORMANT GETS 5-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Longtime jailhouse informant Leslie White was sentenced to five years and eight 
months in state prison Wednesday after pleading guilty to a purse snatching and 
failing to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
White, 31, gained notoriety late last year when he triggered a law enforcement 
review of jailhouse informant policies in Los Angeles by demonstrating for 
authorities that he could pass off as authentic a murder confession from a 
defendant he had never met. 
</P>
<P>
White's revelations prompted an on-going investigation by the county grand jury 
into the use of jailhouse informants by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
White's trial for snatching a woman's purse that contained $8 on Wilshire 
Boulevard in March, 1988, was scheduled to begin Wednesday, but he instead 
pleaded guilty to one count each of grand theft and failing to appear for 
sentencing. He also admitted having two convictions for kidnaping and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
In pleading guilty, White agreed to be sentenced to five years and eight months 
in state prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Longo said. He was sentenced by 
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLAPPED WITH TICKET, ZSA ZSA RETURNS ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor and the Beverly Hills Police Department concur that she was 
arrested Wednesday afternoon when she slapped a Beverly Hills motorcycle 
officer who stopped her for driving a white Rolls-Royce with out-of-date 
license tags. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, there isn't much they agree on. 
</P>
<P>
According to Police Lt. Jim Smith, the 70-year-old actress was pulled over on 
La Cienega Boulevard by the officer, who then found that her driver's license 
had expired. While the officer was checking with the Department of Motor 
Vehicles, said Smith, Gabor "took off." 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified officer, Smith said, stopped her again at Olympic Boulevard 
and LeDoux Road, where he ordered her out of the car. It was then, Smith said, 
that she slapped the officer in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Other officers arrived and Gabor was taken to police headquarters, where she 
was booked for investigation of evading a peace officer, battery on a police 
officer, being an unlicensed driver, driving an unlicensed vehicle and having 
an open alcoholic beverage container in the car while driving, all 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was released pending a July 12 appearance in Beverly Hills Municipal 
Court. She was still furious several hours later when she insisted in an 
interview she did nothing but defend herself as "this gorgeous, tall policeman" 
yanked her out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
She said the car belongs to her husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, and that 
she was unaware that the license was out of date. She drove away the first 
time, she said, only because he kept her standing in the hot sun for 45 minutes 
and he told her she could leave. But then he stopped her a second time. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, she related, the officer hauled her out of the car angrily and 
was "nearly breaking my arm." She added, "It was a reaction that I hit him in 
the face. I am not going to (intentionally) hit a man 6 feet 4 or 6 feet 8. I'm 
not that stupid. I was just trying to protect my arm." 
</P>
<P>
She insisted that the officer made her sit in the middle of the street, used 
obscene language and threatened to "break both your arms and legs." She said 
she was handcuffed so roughly that she screamed in pain and that other officers 
arriving on the scene did nothing to ease the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"They are stupid . . . uneducated," she said. "How can they do that to a lady 
like me?" 
</P>
<P>
As for the bottle, she said it had been in the glove compartment for years. Her 
press agent, Phil Paladino, said, "This lady does not drink. All her friends 
will tell you that."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTY D.A. CLEARED IN 'COTTON CLUB' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a week of testimony and cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn 
was exonerated Wednesday of charges that he withheld evidence from the defense 
during a hearing into the so-called "Cotton Club" murder of New York producer 
Roy Radin. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay ruled that Conn and three sheriff's 
homicide investigators did not try to hide notes, tapes or transcripts of 
interviews with the prosecution's star witness, William Rider. Under terms of a 
court order, Conn must turn over such information to the defense before a 
witness takes the stand. McKay found "substantial compliance" to the order. 
</P>
<P>
During his testimony June 2, Rider said that two of the defendants -- William 
Molony Mentzer and Alex Lamotta Marti -- bragged during a poker game about 
killing Radin. Defense attorneys charged that Conn deliberately kept his 
knowledge of that testimony from them. 
</P>
<P>
Radin's bullet-riddled body was found in a canyon northeast of Los Angeles on 
June 10, 1983.

TREVINO CERTAIN THAT LONG HITTER WILL BE WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Trevino is getting considerable attention on the eve of the start of 89th 
U.S. Open golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Trevino is favored to win, but just that he won the Open at Oak 
Hill Country Club the last time it was played here, in 1968, for his first tour 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, 49, doesn't figure he'll repeat at the same site 21 years later, but 
he has a thought on the type of pro who will win. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think a long hitter will win the tournament," Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
He based his assessment on steady rain here Wednesday and the 70% chance of 
more today. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the rain has taken care of the short hitters," Trevino said. "When you 
come to a U.S. Open, the short hitter who is extremely straight has an 
advantage because there's an opening in front of the greens on the old courses 
that are played in the Open and you can run the ball up. 
</P>
<P>
"And if you don't have soft fairways, the straight hitter can get something 
extra out of his drives. A long hitter doesn't have an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"However, when you get a wet golf course like we have here, the premium is 
going to be on hitting the ball long." 
</P>
<P>
Given that long hitters have an advantage on a soggy course, Trevino was asked 
to identify the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"This will favor Seve (Ballesteros), and Jumbo Ozaki is very long. Greg Norman 
is going to be in there someplace. Nick Faldo is playing extremely well. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy Lyle's game is off a little bit, but he's long. So is Mark Calcavecchia. 
And Curtis Strange has a tremendous amount of willpower and guts. We call him 
the Piranha because if he gets a chance, he'll gobble you right up. And Paul 
Azinger is starting to play very well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be someone young and someone long." 
</P>
<P>
Strange is the defending champion, but that apparently doesn't give him an 
edge, considering that Ben Hogan was the last golfer to win consecutive U.S. 
Opens, in 1950 and '51. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Strange, the PGA player of the year in 1988, has yet to win on the 
tour this year, even though he has earned $323,414 and ranks 13th on the money 
list. 
</P>
<P>
There is usually a hometown favorite at any tournament and that distinction 
belongs to Jeff Sluman, the 1988 PGA champion, who grew up in Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
However, if anyone can be called a favorite, Faldo would fall into that 
category. Not only did he win the Masters last April in a dramatic playoff with 
Scott Hoch, he recently won the European PGA championship and British Masters. 
And he came close to winning the Open last year, losing to Strange in a 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, of course, is the only pro who has a chance to win the Grand Slam -- 
victories in four majors -- Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has given any thought to the Grand Slam, Faldo said: "Not really. 
It's not impossible but the odds are pretty slim, about 50,000 to 1. Hogan and 
(Jack) Nicklaus are the only ones to come close in the last 40 years of golf." 
</P>
<P>
As for his confidence factor in his quest to win another major, Faldo said: 
"The most confident I've ever been was a couple of weeks ago when I won the 
British Masters. But this game can kick you in the teeth if you get too 
excited. You have to bring yourself down to earth and start again." 
</P>
<P>
Faldo said he hasn't been dwelling on his U.S. Open loss to Strange last year. 
However, there could be some pressure on Strange considering his status as the 
defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
Strange said he has had some sleepless nights pondering the defense of his 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult not to get caught up defending a major," Strange said. "I've 
been trying to play tournaments, but it's tough because you keep coming back to 
the Open. That's what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do well, of course. I'm the defending champion and that means a lot 
personally. Everyone will look to see what I shoot. Yes, I'm under the 
microscope." 
</P>
<P>
Strange had won two tournaments last year before winning the Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not on the same level I was at last year, but I'm not far from it," he 
said. "I've probably tried too hard to win rather than just let it happen this 
season. I've said all along, the best thing I can do in 1989 is forget about 
what happened in 1988. I think I've done that." 
</P>
<P>
He may have last year, when he became the first golfer to win $1 million or 
more in a season, in perspective, but the Open is special to him -- as it is to 
any pro. 
</P>
<P>
Strange's best tour finishes this year were third place in the Doral Ryder, 
Honda and Nestle Invitational tournaments in February and March. 
</P>
<P>
Although Trevino believes that the long hitters have an advantage on the 
6,902-yard, par-70 Oak Hill course, others, such as Nicklaus, say that the 
player with the best all-around game will prevail in the Open. 
</P>
<P>
"Two things are important," said Craig Harmon, the pro at Oak Hill. "Good 
driving and good iron play. Accuracy off the tees and into the greens are 
premiums." 
</P>
<P>
Oak Hill isn't as long as many other courses, but it can be deceiving. For 
example, many of the fairways are narrow and the two par-five holes, the 
570-yard No. 4 and 594-yard No. 13, are virtually unreachable in two shots. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the three finishing holes, Nos. 16, 17 and 18, are par-fours 
measuring 439, 458 and 440 yards, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the rough is overly high, but it will be by Sunday if it can't 
be mowed," Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ballesteros after a practice round: "If the course gets any more water, it 
will be unplayable. Other than that it's a perfect setup." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
A United States Golf Assn. official said that if today's first round is rained 
out and the weather clears, 36 holes will be played Sunday. The Open is not 
like regular tour events, which call for sudden-death playoffs to settle 
first-place ties. A tie here will result in an 18-hole playoff Monday. If there 
is still a tie after the extra 18 holes, then it goes to sudden death. . . . 
There are 156 players in the field, 55 of whom received automatic bids based on 
past performances and exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
The total purse for the Open is $1.1 million with the winner -- if he's a pro 
-- receiving $200,000. . . . Fourteen former Open champions are in the field. . 
. . Jack Nicklaus disputes those who say that winning a major championship has 
more to do with luck than preparation. "Guys who say you can't prepare for a 
major are the guys who haven't won them," said Nicklaus, who has won 18 majors, 
including four U.S. Opens. "It's as simple as that."

DISPLAYS OF RESPECT FOR HER HUSBAND EASE PAIN OF VERA CLEMENTE'S NICARAGUA 
VISIT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clemente's flight hasn't made it to Managua this time, either. Vera Clemente's, 
that is. 
</P>
<P>
But the plane taking her back to Nicaragua for the first time since the death 
of her husband, Roberto Clemente of the Pittsburgh Pirates, on New Year's Eve, 
1972, has not disappeared into the Caribbean, as his did. It simply has not 
gotten off the ground in San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
Commandante Emmett Lang, Nicaragua's minister of sport, huddles with an 
entourage from the Institute of Sport at Augusto Cesar Sandino International 
Airport. Magdalena Lacayo, 16, daughter of the chief of protocol, stands 
quietly nearby, her bouquet of flowers wilting in the late spring afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Lang and the welcoming party retreat to the shade while aides try to track down 
Vera Clemente's flight. Mechanical difficulties have grounded it in Puerto 
Rico. Perhaps, they hope, she will find other connections. 
</P>
<P>
If not, this Central American nation of 3 million, who have waited for more 
than 16 years to honor the man who died on a mission to help the victims of the 
1972 Managua earthquake, will wait even longer. 
</P>
<P>
But Vera Clemente, 48, unfazed by a roundabout itinerary that takes her in an 
arc around the Caribbean, does not disappoint. The woman with short black hair 
swept back over an unlined face arrives after dark. 
</P>
<P>
With a grace that has evolved over a quarter of century as the wife and then 
widow of the Caribbean basin's greatest athlete ever, Vera Clemente faces the 
impending swirl of recognition with composure. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to Nicaragua with Roberto in November, 1972, when he managed the Puerto 
Rican team in the world amateur baseball championships," Vera says as she walks 
through what once was downtown Managua. 
</P>
<P>
Despite four batting crowns and 12 Gold Gloves, the Pirate right fielder had 
labored in relative obscurity until dazzling the baseball world during the 1971 
World Series. The next season, he got his 3,000th hit and became a hero across 
the Caribbean basin. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to Nicaragua and found the people as we had been in Puerto Rico 30 
years ago," Vera says. "Roberto saw himself in the boys in the streets -- 
without shoes, living in a one-room house -- much like it had been when his 
father worked for the sugar mill in Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"He changed a twenty-dollar bill into coins each morning and called boys over 
as we walked to ask them about their families. What work did their father do? 
What had they eaten for dinner last night? And then he dug into his pockets for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
They returned to Puerto Rico on Dec. 8, accompanied by Federico and Marianne 
Lacayo. Marianne, who was from Puerto Rico, was pregnant with Magdalena. 
</P>
<P>
"We were eating at our house on Dec. 23, when Federico felt a terrible upset in 
his stomach and had to lie down," Vera says. "We soon found out that that was 
when the earthquake hit Managua." 
</P>
<P>
The upheaval killed 7,000, injured 20,000, and left 200,000 homeless. The 
Clementes spearheaded relief efforts in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Bank of America building, the National Palace, and the 
Intercontinental Hotel survived the tremors. Sixteen years later, central 
Managua remains largely unreconstructed. Families squat in the shells of 
buildings while boys play stickball in the hulking ruins of the national 
cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Vera takes it all in as she walks down streets where she once strolled arm in 
arm with Roberto, in what was to be their last time alone together. 
</P>
<P>
Clemente is quiet as she enters the elevator -- one of only five in the country 
-- of the Intercontinental Hotel, where she and Roberto stayed in 1972. Moments 
later, standing by the window in what was then Howard Hughes' penthouse, she 
stares at Lake Managua and the craggy mountains and volcanoes that surround the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
When the earthquake hit, Hughes and Gen. Anastasio Somoza, Nicaragua's 
president-dictator, were in this room negotiating the sale of the Corn Islands 
off the Atlantic Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the quake, stories of the National Guard pilfering relief supplies 
began to surface and crews on the aid flights the Clementes sent had difficulty 
getting their goods to those in need. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people here kept asking Roberto to come and straighten things out," 
Clemente says. "He didn't want to come. 'I will work better in Puerto Rico,' he 
said. But our people were having to fight to get the supplies to Masaya, where 
many of the survivors had gone. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost went together, but we had friends coming and one of us had to stay. 
Then, I almost went instead of him, but he decided to go," Vera says with a 
shake of her head. "Someone asked him to wait until after New Year's Eve so 
that we could be together, but Roberto said, 'Don't worry. For me, every day is 
the same.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Clemente's flight took off the evening of Dec. 31 but plunged into the 
waters off Playa Isla Verde minutes later. Four others died with Clemente, 
whose body was never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake ultimately caused Roberto Clemente's death, and a hurricane 
brought Vera back to Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to come back," she said on the road to Masaya the next day. "We 
were so happy here together. That is why I waited so long. And I was a little 
scared by the revolution and fighting that has gone on here." 
</P>
<P>
But last October, Hurricane Joan smashed into Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, 
pulverizing Bluefields and leveling the Corn Islands. There were 115 deaths, 
and the storm left hundreds of thousands homeless and caused millions of 
dollars in damage on an already devastated economy. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Puerto Ricans could not deny Roberto Clemente's plea to aid Nicaragua 
in 1972, they could not refuse Nicaragua help after the hurricane. Vera soon 
joined the Committee to Aid the Victims of the Hurricane. A flotilla of 
container vessels filled with seeds and medicine and paid for by the committee 
arrived in Nicaragua in April. "I had been asked to return many times, but I 
wasn't ready," she said. "Then Trish Beatty from Pittsburgh called and asked me 
to go as the guest of the Roberto Clemente Sports Project in San Isidro. I was 
going to say no, but finally I thought, 'Let me go and take the chance.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was time to complete Roberto's mission. 
</P>
<P>
They remember Roberto Clemente better on the streets of Masaya than they do in 
Pittsburgh these days. Every boy playing ball on its cobblestone streets can 
recite at least some of his statistics. But they recall Clemente in Masaya, and 
throughout Nicaragua, not so much for the verve with which he played, but 
because, as the grizzled groundskeeper at the ballpark there explains, "He died 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
"Roberto adopted Masaya," Vera Clemente says. "And Masaya adopted Roberto right 
back." 
</P>
<P>
There weren't bullet holes pocking the walls the last time Clemente was here 
and the market where they bargained with Indian artisans had not been destroyed 
by the air strikes Somoza ordered in a last-ditch effort to stop the 
Sandinista-led insurrection. But the ballpark, since renamed Estadio Roberto 
Clemente, still is perched above the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Vera Clemente heads first to the pediatric clinic that she and the Clemente 
Foundation helped build in 1976. Clemente lost touch with its staff during the 
insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know if it is still functioning," she had whispered on the drive 
from Managua. 
</P>
<P>
Her fears multiply when she finds the clinic padlocked, and the marker missing 
from an engraving of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Federico Lacayo scrapes corrosion off the plaque at the front gate with his 
pocket knife. Vera excuses herself and walks to the edge of the lagoon. Across 
the water, Volcan Masaya smolders. 
</P>
<P>
But when Clemente returns to the clinic, it has opened for the day and her 
unhappiness with the shabbiness of its exterior is replaced by relief at the 
cleanliness of its interior and attentiveness of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Clemente's caravan proceeds to the stadium. The party enters under a painting 
of Roberto and walks up a ramp to a statue of him at bat. 
</P>
<P>
The directorate of the San Fernando club, Masaya's entry in the Nicaraguan 
league, assembles on the infield grass and presents Vera a club uniform. On its 
sleeves, and those of every other jersey, is stitched the number 21, Clemente's 
number with the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The directors escort Vera to the San Fernando clubhouse, where the fourth game 
of the Nicaraguan championship series is about to begin on television. They 
stand when a minute of silence is observed for Roberto after the national 
anthem. 
</P>
<P>
If Vera Clemente's return to Nicaragua is an encounter with a bittersweet past, 
for Nicaragua, it was a moment a long time in the coming. 
</P>
<P>
Clemente's return was front page news, vying for coverage with Gorbachev's 
visit to Cuba and Nicaragua's championship series in baseball. For the 
Sandinista government, it was a chance to enjoy the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
One evening, Clemente shared a table with Minister of Sport Lang, who regaled 
her with tales of the underground. A boyish-looking 41 with a Clark Gable 
mustache, Lang told of guerrilla theater in the barrios. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Vera had broken bread, actually vanilla wafers, with a 
group of women, each of whom had had a child kidnaped by the contras. They 
petitioned her to help force the contras to allow inspectors into their camps 
in Honduras to determine if their children are there. 
</P>
<P>
On her fifth day in country, Vera Clemente accepted, for Roberto, the highest 
honor Nicaragua bestows upon a sporting figure, the Eduardo Green award. Named 
for the best ballplayer the country produced, the award had never before been 
given to a foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
Lang paid thoughtful tribute to Clemente at the ceremony, before President 
Daniel Ortega pinned the award to Vera's dress and embraced her. At the 
reception afterward, Ortega invited Clemente to join him the next day at the 
start-up of a hydro-electric project in Asturias. 
</P>
<P>
On the road before dawn, Clemente's caravan races northward at twice the posted 
speed limit into country that only months ago was a hit-and-run battlefield. It 
is good terrain for growing coffee, and for contra ambushes. One of the drivers 
points to a spot where he was shot earlier in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks have lessened since last year's truce, and signs of re-building are 
evident. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega swoops overhead in his camouflage-painted helicopter an hour before the 
Clemente convoy reaches Asturias. But Ortega, elected president in 1985, delays 
the ceremony until Clemente arrives. 
</P>
<P>
Seated on the stage, Clemente listens as Ortega describes the Central American 
peace process and stresses his nation's need to determine its own destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the fierce sense of independence that propelled Roberto Clemente's 
evolution on and off the field, Ortega says, "And we will continue in the 
spirit of Roberto Clemente, a ballplayer and a man who showed his solidarity 
with the people of Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, at lunch in a hilltop pavilion, Ortega sits with Clemente and her 
party for over an hour. He questions more than answers, listening closely to 
his guests. 
</P>
<P>
They discuss from Puerto Rico's political culture to a history of the 
Sandinista insurrection and the U.S.-backed counter-revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Before she leaves Nicaragua, Clemente returns to a lakeside restaurant near 
Granada. As she did the last time, Vera takes a ride through the swamp-like 
archipelago of little islands, egrets, and freshwater sharks. Her launch is 
named the Carolina. The outboard's propellers become tangled in the lily pads 
and Lacayo, chief of protocol for this quasi-state visit, cuts a lily for Vera. 
</P>
<P>
Vera Clemente has been married now to Roberto Clemente's memory twice as long 
as she was to the man himself. "For me, he was such a good husband, such a good 
father, and such a good son," she says. "It is as if I owe him fidelity. I 
never thought of marrying again. I feel satisfied to have my children and use 
my time the way I am using it -- to help whomever I can in my own way." 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledges: "There are moments when I think about how different it would 
be if he were here, but then I throw myself back into my work. . . . When we 
walked through Managua and went to the Intercontinental Hotel where we stayed, 
it brought back a lot of remembrances. They were sad memories because he is not 
here now, and here I am. At the same time, I feel sad because all these years 
these people have suffered so much. They are trying to come up again, now, 
little by little, but it is a hard situation, and it will take time. When I 
went to the clinic in Masaya and the Roberto Clemente school in Managua and saw 
their needs, I was wishing that I was a millionaire just to help." 
</P>
<P>
Clemente said she has a new commitment to the future instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think now that my feelings for Nicaragua are stronger," she says. "Somehow, 
if I can do something to help, I will. I will try to learn more about the 
situation here. Roberto always said that he was with the government that wants 
to help the people. I hope that is what will happen here. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It has been hard coming back, but at the same time, I feel better because I 
know that the people still love Roberto here. Even the kids that did not know 
him -- who were born just a few years ago -- they show their love for him. I 
did not expect all that. I knew that some people remembered him, but all these 
people, everywhere you go. It makes me feel he is still alive."

<P>
A golf open is not a contest between Nicklaus and Palmer, Hogan and Snead, 
Jones and Sarazen. 
</P>
<P>
A golf tournament is more like a contest between Nicklaus and Nicklaus. It's 
not man to man. It's man against nature. The sailor against the sea, the 
trapper against the blizzard, the pioneer against the desert. 
</P>
<P>
You take the golfer on the first tee. He doesn't look over and say, "My God, I 
gotta play Curtis Strange!" 
</P>
<P>
What he says is, "My God! It's a dogleg left and I don't have a hook." 
</P>
<P>
What scares him is not another guy with an eight-iron in his hand, it's water 
on the right, the green that slopes to the back, the wind coming off the ocean 
or one of the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
You look at a golf course and see the birds, the trees, the green grass -- 
nature in its element. He looks and he sees double bogeys, out of bounds left, 
two-break greens, deep bunkers and unreachable par-fives. He feels like the 
captain of a sinking ship with no lifeboats. For a guy who has to play it, it 
might as well be downtown Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers, to a man, know who the enemy is. It's that 6,902-yard hall of horrors 
out there, built just the opposite way his own game goes. If he plays a draw, 
he's sure it favors a fade. If he's a left-to-right player, he is positive it 
was laid out for a right-to-left guy. 
</P>
<P>
Who can forget Lee Trevino talking himself out of a Masters green coat over the 
years, moaning that the sloping fairways do not yield to his low, boring shots? 
</P>
<P>
Can anyone forget the American players, teeing up in their first British Opens 
and noticing that the greens are not the freshly watered dart boards they are 
used to in the States, complaining, "I can't play that run-up shot you have to 
play around here." 
</P>
<P>
The course is like a bad bull to the matador, a noise in the attic to a guy 
who's afraid of the dark. And not only do courses frustrate players, sometimes 
single holes do. 
</P>
<P>
Who can forget the trouble Jack Nicklaus had with the 18th at Riviera? If he 
could have handled that piece of real estate as well as he did finishing holes 
at other golf courses, say, the 18th at Augusta, he might have won another PGA, 
to say nothing of an L.A. Open or two. 
</P>
<P>
If Oak Hill, where they are playing the 89th United States Open here this 
weekend, were human, it would be a junk pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
We all know what a junk pitcher is. He's a guy who stands out there on the 
mound looking sad or even overweight. His uniform is a lousy fit because he 
doesn't care about things like that. 
</P>
<P>
His pitch, like him, comes in nice and fat and off-speed and looking for all 
the world as hittable as a batting-practice lob. Then you swing -- and the ball 
goes straight up in the air to be gobbled up by the catcher or the first 
baseman in foul territory. 
</P>
<P>
The batter's forehead is creased with rage. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't got a thing," he snarls, hurling his bat and a helmet back in the 
dugout. "My kid could throw harder, and she's a girl." 
</P>
<P>
The junk pitcher keeps the hitters off balance. They scream at him, "Throw the 
ball up here like a man!" 
</P>
<P>
That's the way Oak Hill is. It's not a brute of a course, a man killer, like, 
say, Pebble Beach. If Pebble Beach were human, it would be flying a 
skull-and-crossbones and have a parrot on its shoulder and a wooden leg and a 
dagger in its teeth and the Queen's navy would be looking for it with a rope on 
the Spanish Main. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Hill is kind of your basic baby-faced sociopath. You wouldn't cross the 
street if you saw it coming. But you should. 
</P>
<P>
It looks so innocent. It starts out with a par-four that is one of those holes 
whose fingerprints are all over the murder weapon but who is as unlikely a 
suspect as the butler. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Ben Hogan. Ben lost the 1956 Open by a shot here. Conventional 
experting blames it on a 2 1/2-foot putt he missed on 17 in the final round. 
But Hogan also took a 5 on this par-four that day and is quoted in the current 
Open program describing this hole as "the toughest starting hole in golf." If 
Hogan can't par it on Day 4 of an Open, it must be. 
</P>
<P>
Hole No. 2 is called the Breather. Hah! The green is so small, you wonder what 
they did with the phone. Just to be on it puts you in the leather. 
</P>
<P>
They don't call this Oak Hill carelessly. Three more oak trees and every hole 
would be a carom off the tee. It's not a course, it's a forest. As Fred Allen 
might have said, Oak Hill is a great place -- if you're a squirrel. They've got 
some oak trees here that go as far back as Alexander Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
It's not one of those golf courses where you're going to shoot a whole bunch of 
7s and 8s. It's too subtle for that. It doesn't blow you away. As with any junk 
pitcher, its stock-in-trade is to get you to try something you probably can't 
do. 
</P>
<P>
You know Oak Hill is doing its job when you listen to the hitters who are going 
up against it. If you know golfers, you know they will scream about a course 
they think has them overmatched, like a baseball batter who accuses a 
successful pitcher of throwing a spitter. Golfers throw around the words 
monster, unfair, tricked up and travesty of golf on courses they find out they 
can't play, greens they can't hit. 
</P>
<P>
But when they talk about Oak Hill, they sound like guys who have just picked up 
three aces. They try not to smirk. 
</P>
<P>
"A dead-honest golf course," allowed Ben Crenshaw, who has won 14 tour events 
but none of them an Open. 
</P>
<P>
Summed up Curtis Strange, the defending Open champion: "Straightforward. No 
tricks to it. Everything there seems like it should be there. Natural." 
</P>
<P>
English translation: Oak Hill doesn't have a thing on the ball. We're going up 
there swinging -- 63s, here we come! 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what Oak Hill wants them to think. Just wait till they try to 
get wood on Oak Hill's changeup. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday night, you can bet they'll be yelling, "Why don't you come out and 
fight like a man! How can anybody hit this slop? Why don't you just stand there 
and fight back, like Pebble Beach?!" 
</P>
<P>
And Oak Hill will just smile sweetly and say, "You better hit another one. 
You'll never find that one."

'GOODBY' -- AND 'WHAT NEXT?'; 
</P>
<P>
AS LAKERS PACK UP, CENTER QUESTION IS LOOSE BAGGAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The end of the Lakers as we have known them arrived Wednesday morning when they 
gathered at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Playoff shares were determined, off-season plans related and, perhaps, the 
disappointment of the four consecutive losses to the Detroit Pistons in the 
National Basketball Assn. championship series rationalized. Then, before 
parting, goodbys were said -- some for the summer, some for good. 
</P>
<P>
Change is unavoidable, now that the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era has ended. 
Abdul-Jabbar's retired jersey eventually will be hoisted to the Forum ceiling 
alongside those of Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers knew this day eventually would come. But those expecting the Lakers 
to swing a major trade or free-agent signing of a premier center probably will 
be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be fun, a new challenge, to see if we can win without Kareem," 
Magic Johnson said. "The driving force for me now is the '90s. It's a whole new 
time with a new center. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten for a while, and I'm going 
to go for (another title) again." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pat Riley, assessing the past and contemplating the future, said the 
Lakers still could be the team of the early '90s without radical changes. Riley 
already has created a theme for next season, "the Question Mark," referring to 
what might have happened had Johnson and Byron Scott not been sidelined because 
of hamstring injuries during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to be a leading contender next year," Riley said. "I don't 
think we've got to mess with our four (starters). We've got four corners 
filled, and now we have to put somebody in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"The Question Mark will gnaw at me all summer, and it will be lingering next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Who will that somebody in the middle be? Quality centers are in short supply 
and they usually come at the expense of several premier players at other 
positions. And West, the club's general manager, said the Lakers are a 
championship caliber team as is. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll look around a little bit and see what might be our best options," West 
said. "We may not be a lot different than we are today. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't going to be bankrupt at all next year. We think we have a real fine 
team right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers will have half of Abdul-Jabbar's 1988-89 salary -- $1.5 million -- 
available to acquire a replacement. It does not have to be a center -- and it 
might not be -- but the Lakers must use the money before this season or lose it 
under salary-cap restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Other questions also lingered: -- What of power forward A.C. Green, the club's 
leading rebounder, who will become a restricted free agent? 
</P>
<P>
Green could receive an offer sheet from another team, which the Lakers most 
likely would match, or sign for another season with the Lakers at a significant 
salary increase and become an unrestricted free agent after next season. 
</P>
<P>
Green, also the Lakers' fourth-leading scorer and arguably their most durable 
player, certainly will receive a major raise from the $269,000 he earned this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring to make in excess of $1 million a season, Green also might be the 
Laker most likely to be swapped if the club does the unexpected and makes a 
blockbuster trade for a center. "Just because you have (big) names, that 
doesn't mean you can't explore and see what those names might bring," said 
West, declining to talk specifically about players or the club's needs. "But, 
again, we plan to do something we hope will help our team and we like the 
players we have now." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Green was noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to get into it yet," he said. "I want to rest some." 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley: "Everybody probably wants A. C. Other teams are probably thinking 
that the Lakers might have a problem signing him and want to trade. But I think 
we've got to keep him." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The league will hold its expansion draft today, and David Rivers, the 
third-string point guard, figures to be selected by either the Orlando Magic or 
Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
Teams can protect only eight players and can lose only one. But since the 
Lakers have only eight players under contract -- Johnson, Scott, James Worthy, 
Green, Thompson, Orlando Woolridge, Michael Cooper and Rivers -- they must 
offer one of them. 
</P>
<P>
With Rivers perhaps headed elsewhere, the Lakers say they will need to select a 
quick guard with their first-round pick -- the 24th overall -- in the college 
draft June 27. 
</P>
<P>
"A guard is our priority," Riley said. "One who is multi-dimensional." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Perhaps two of the Lakers' three unrestricted free-agent fringe players 
will go elsewhere. Tony Campbell, the ninth man in an eight-man rotation, said 
he would prefer to play somewhere else rather than spend another season on the 
bench. Jeff Lamp has considered a return to pro ball in Italy, but Mark 
McNamara probably will be re-signed because the Lakers' need for a third-string 
center appears even greater now. 
</P>
<P>
The center question figures to linger all summer, or at least until the Lakers' 
use the $1.5 million to sign someone. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective replacements have been speculated upon for months: Sam Bowie or 
Ralph Sampson through trade or Denver's Wayne Cooper through free agency. 
However, West has indicated that it might not be a center. Or, if it is, it 
probably will be a big body, not a big name. 
</P>
<P>
Should trade opportunities arise, the Lakers will have to dip into a core group 
that enabled the Lakers to win consecutive NBA titles and advance to the finals 
this season. Teams would be asking for Scott and Green and perhaps Michael 
Cooper, but the Lakers seem hesitant to break up what is left of the designated 
team of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Of acquiring a big-name center, West said: "That just can't happen anymore. 
There are too many teams. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the biggest premium in the league today? Centers. There aren't enough 
around, and that's why I think you've seen teams go to a different style of 
basketball. A lot more passing-game kind of things." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson performed capably as Abdul-Jabbar's backup, performing as a reserve in 
name only. He averaged more playing time and rebounds than Abdul-Jabbar, and 
nearly as many points. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has slowly been undergoing a metamorphosis, and I think Pat himself 
has alluded to that," West said. "By the nature of the scoring from our team 
today, there is a different look than there was a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll see this team play similar to the way we have played, maybe a 
different look offensively a bit. But that's the coach's decision. I want to 
help Pat get the players to implement the way he wants to play." 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley: "You can't get a great, great center. You can't trade for anybody 
these days. But if we can find someone who can play defense and get some 
rebounds and maybe a few blocked shots, that's all we need. We've got four or 
five key players that will go into the '90s, and Jerry will fit the rest of the 
pieces together." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said the players acquired for next season will have to fit into the Laker 
way of basketball, because he doesn't foresee a drastic change of style. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been a power post-up team for 10 years, so some of the players we get 
have to have skills that complement that," Riley said. "With Mychal Thompson 
(at center), we're more than competent. We're not as big, but maybe if we can 
find (a center) to help him out, we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said his adjustment will not be drastic, since the Lakers have not 
emphasized the center in their offense for about three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need a premium center to win, as long as you got other guys coming 
off the bench," he said. "The offense doesn't have to revolve around the 
center, as we learned with (Detroit's Bill) Laimbeer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our nucleus is still here -- myself, Byron and James. We've done most of the 
scoring the last couple of years. You got to make changes just to keep getting 
better. I'm not saying by trades, but by draft choices and free agents." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, the Lakers' leading playoff scorer with a 24.8 average, predicted that 
the Lakers no longer will dominate the league but still will be contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it'll be real competitive," Worthy said. "We'll be almost equal now with 
the rest of the West. We can't take anything for granted. We'll have to fight 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we'll have to be more aggressive, more physical, change our style a 
little bit that way." 
</P>
<P>
Become bad boys, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Worthy said. "Bad men." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
For finishing second, the Lakers will divide $486,875 in bonuses among 12 
players and trainer Gary Vitti, and another share will be split among other 
team personnel. Each share will be worth $33,776. The Pistons will divide 
$691,875. . . . Vitti said that Magic Johnson and Byron Scott will continue 
treatment on their hamstring injuries. Johnson, however, ruled himself out of 
Larry Bird's charity all-star game in French Lick, Ind., later this month. . . 
. Johnson said that not playing in the finals was the most difficult thing he 
has had to deal with in his life. "But I'm not going to be what-iffing all 
summer," he said.

BEN JOHNSON'S 100-METER RECORD SHOULDN'T STAND, ATHLETES AND OFFICIALS SAY

Ben Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash and it 
should be awarded to Carl Lewis, many U.S. track and field officials and 
athletes said Wednesday in the aftermath of Johnson admitting to his steroid 
use. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson testified this week at a Canadian inquiry that his seven-year 
involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections before 
the 1987 World Championships in Rome, where he set the existing world record of 
9.83 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to see the evidence, but if he was on drugs at the time of the 
World Championships, my thought would be to remove his record," said Ollan 
Cassell, executive director of The Athletics Congress, the national governing 
board for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Cassell is also a vice president of the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, the world governing organization. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that Johnson could lose his record was raised when the IAAF 
asked for "an urgent legal opinion" to see what it could do about records and 
championships of confessed drug users. 
</P>
<P>
The issue would be decided at the IAAF Congress, scheduled for Barcelona, 
Spain, in September. 
</P>
<P>
"The . . . actions would allow the IAAF, if it so decided, retroactively to 
withdraw results obtained and any records achieved by such athletes," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear, however, whether any action taken by the congress would 
affect Johnson's world mark because effective dates of retroactive sanctions 
would have to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Greenberg, TAC president, said: "We'll wait to see what Canada does," 
following the country's inquiry at which 40 persons, among them Johnson, his 
coach, Charlie Francis, and his physician, Jamie Astaphan, testified. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we will do our best to advocate that our athlete, Carl Lewis, gets the 
world record," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has the second-fastest legal time in history, 9.92, in finishing second 
to Johnson at last year's Seoul Olympics. Johnson, who clocked 9.79 in that 
race, lost the record and his gold medal, and was barred from competition for 
two years after testing positive for an anabolic steroid.

<P>
There was much discussion among athletes competing this week in the TAC 
Championships about whether Johnson should be allowed back into the sport after 
he completes his two-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis thinks he should. 
</P>
<P>
"He went a long time without telling the truth, but he broke down and he has 
told the truth," said Lewis, a six-time Olympic gold medalist. "He is giving us 
an opportunity to believe him, to support him. 
</P>
<P>
"I even heard him speaking out against drugs and that's the important thing." 
</P>
<P>
Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the triple jump, said Johnson 
should be allowed to compete again, only because that is the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"But all his records should be taken because he admitted it," Joyner added. 
</P>
<P>
"He killed a lot of fans . . . a lot of young kids . . . and he almost killed 
our sport . . . he put a dark shadow over it . . . because of who he was," 
Joyner said. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinter Harvey Glance, a three-time Olympian and president of TAC's Athletes 
Advisory Committee, said Johnson should be allowed to return after two years. 
</P>
<P>
"But if he admits he was on anything (when he set the record), then it should 
go to the next person, Carl Lewis," Glance said. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the records will show it and only Ben knows." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was tested after his world-record run in Rome, but the results were 
negative.

Michael Chang got a quick lesson on the ups and downs of professional tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who won the French Open on Sunday, was beaten by Johan Kriek, 1-6, 7-6, 
6-4, Wednesday in the round-robin Continental Grass Court Championships at 
Rosmalen, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Chang became the first American to win the French Open since 
1955 by defeating Sweden's Stefan Edberg last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Mats Wilander, struggling to regain the form that made him No. 1 in the world 
earlier this year, beat David Wheaton, 7-6 (10-8), 2-6, 6-3, in the second 
round of the Queens Club grass-court championships at London. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Pete Sampras upset fifth-seeded Kevin Curren, 6-3, 6-3, 
top-seeded Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia trounced Australian Mark Kratzmann, 
6-2, 6-3, in 73 minutes, Chris Bailey of England downed 18-year-old Venezuelan 
Nicolas Pereira, 6-3, 7-6, and Tim Wilkison ousted fourth-seeded Tim Mayotte, 
6-3, 7-6 (11-9). 
</P>
<P>
Pam Shriver, who has been pondering retirement recently, was knocked off by Ann 
Henricksson, 7-6 (10-8), 7-5, in the third round of a Virginia Slims tournament 
at Edgbaston, England. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a lot of ambition," Shriver said. "I'm questioning the values of 
it and don't know how much I want to play, if at all." 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, second-seeded Zina Garrison struggled past 11th-seeded Kathy 
Rinaldi, 6-1, 5-7, 6-1, Betsy Nagelsen defeated Sophie Amiach of France, 6-3, 
6-4, and 12th-seeded Elna Reinach of South Africa beat seventh-seeded Anne 
Minter of Australia, 6-1, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe, continuing his build-up for Wimbledon, scored a 6-3, 6-1 victory 
over unranked qualifier Ross Matheson of Scotland in the first round of the 
Scottish grass-court championships at Edinburgh, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt fine, the court was a bit soft but it was just the sort of first- round 
match I needed," said McEnroe, who had trouble with the Scot's serve in the 
first set. 
</P>
<P>
In another first-round match, Vitas Gerulaitis, who recently came out of 
retirement, beat David Felgate of Britain, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Guillermo Perez Roldan beat fellow Argentine Gabriel Markus, 6-3, 
6-3, in the second round of an international tournament at Bologna, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, fourth-seeded Ronald Agenor of Argentina ousted Raoul Viver 
of Ecuador, 6-4, 6-1, and Roberto Azar of Argentina eliminated Andres Vysand of 
the Soviet Union, 6-3, 6-2.

AFTER MISSING FRENCH OPEN, EVERT IS UP FOR WIMBLEDON 
</P>

Chris Evert, trying to overcome a case of burnout that caused her to skip the 
French Open, left for England Wednesday saying she's looking forward to 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't get psyched up for Wimbledon (which starts June 26), you can't 
get psyched up for anything," Evert said. "I've practiced on grass the past two 
weeks, I'm having fun at practice and I hope I can enjoy myself and play good 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the physical burnout. A lot of athletes are still competitive at 38 
or 40. But mentally it's being 100% intense every match. Nowadays that's not as 
easy for me." 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 34, winner of 18 Grand Slam singles titles, made her comments at a news 
conference to announce a celebrity tournament Oct. 21-22 in Boca Raton that 
will bear her name. 
</P>
<P>
"You all probably thought I called this press conference to announce my 
retirement," Evert said. "You're wrong. I know in my heart that it's going to 
happen soon. Whether soon is in three months or nine months, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Evert's husband, Andy Mill, said his wife is going to England in tremendous 
shape and with a good attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"She still has the desire and fortitude to win," Mill said. "She still loves 
the game. This could be her last year, but she still really wants to play." 
</P>
<P>
Evert didn't feel that way when she was knocked out of her last tournament, the 
European Open, by unheralded Barbara Paulus on May 24. 
</P>
<P>
"After that match I said to Andy, 'Who needs this?' " Evert recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The next day she withdrew from the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it just has to do with the work that goes into playing on clay," 
Evert said. "The past few years I've enjoyed playing hardcourts and indoors and 
on grass a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
"I skipped a tournament I had won seven times, and I didn't think I had 
anything else to prove. Other people thought it was a bigger deal than I did."

ATHLETIC COMMISSION OFFICIAL FIRED; ALLEGEDLY RECEIVED GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Denkin, the state boxing official under fire since being accused in 
January of accepting unauthorized gifts, was fired Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Denkin's dismissal was announced by Michael A. Kelley, director of the 
California Department of Consumer Affairs, in Sacramento. Kelley cited a 
departmental investigation which, he said, revealed Denkin accepted jewelry and 
cash from boxing managers and promoters in exchange for approval of bouts. 
</P>
<P>
Denkin, 54, was the California Athletic Commission's assistant executive 
officer and ran the commission's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
His difficulties first arose last January when the San Jose Mercury News 
reported that three unidentified managers had accused Denkin of accepting more 
than $10,000 in cash and jewelry in exchange for favors for their boxers. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said at the time that Denkin 
was the subject of an investigation. However, no charges were filed by the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last February, it was learned by The Times that Denkin and Ken Gray, 
Athletic Commission executive officer, had issued a manager's license to Harold 
Rossfields Smith. A decade ago, Smith was convicted of embezzling $21.3 million 
from Wells Fargo Bank. Smith served nearly six years of a 10-year prison term 
before being paroled. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, commission members said, applications from individuals who have been 
convicted of felonies are submitted to the eight-member commission and 
considered at public meetings. Denkin, Kelley said, has 20 days to appeal his 
dismissal.

The Detroit Pistons returned in triumph Wednesday as about 2,000 broom-toting, 
screaming fans helped them celebrate their first National Basketball Assn. 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in a humid drizzle, the crowd chanted, "Bad Boys! Bad Boys!' -- the 
team's adopted nickname -- as the private jet touched down at Willow Run 
Airport. Not even jet engines could drown out the chants as the jet, Round Ball 
One, rolled to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
Players walked along the cordoned-off crowd, grasping hands, high-fiving and 
exchanging greetings. But they had to scramble back to the plane when the crowd 
broke through the cordon and swarmed toward the jet. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft's engines were restarted and the jet taxied several hundred feet 
away so the Pistons could get on a waiting bus. 
</P>
<P>
But the players didn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no feeling like this," center James Edwards said. "I've seen how my 
friends are after winning the world championship, and now we've got one." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I feel," said forward John Salley. "It's hit us, but it 
hasn't hit us. We're champions now. We came in with the right attitude, stayed 
modest, stayed humble. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the Bad Boys." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons completed their sweep of the Lakers on Tuesday night, 105-97.

DAY ONE OF RETIREMENT IS NO TIME TO KICK BACK

The first day of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's retirement was hardly leisurely. 
</P>
<P>
Retirement began at 4 a.m. Wednesday, when a limousine pulled up to 
Abdul-Jabbar's Bel-Air home and took him to a studio for a live interview on 
CBS' morning show. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he met at the Forum with his former Laker teammates to determine playoff 
shares. He left carrying a large box of his personal effects, declining to stop 
and speak with reporters. By that time, most of Abdul-Jabbar's day was shot. 
Soon, however, Abdul-Jabbar reportedly plans to relax for a while at his 
Hawaiian home before beginning a basketball tour of Southeast Asia in July with 
a band of other former NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
Laker players said goodby after the meeting, and close friend Magic Johnson 
spoke with Abdul-Jabbar privately. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been private between us," Johnson said. "But it wasn't goodby, 
because I'll see him here and in Hawaii. It was more 'Thank you and let's get 
together and not forget about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Laker players, meanwhile, went on a souvenir spree after Tuesday night's loss. 
Coach Pat Riley took Abdul-Jabbar's jersey, Magic Johnson his warmup jacket, 
Byron Scott his shoes and public relations director Josh Rosenfeld his shorts.

State Sen. Ernest L. Passailaigue said Wednesday that he will introduce a 
resolution in the South Carolina General Assembly next week, asking the 
commissioner of baseball to clear the name of Shoeless Joe Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and seven other Chicago White Sox players were accused of throwing the 
1919 World Series to Cincinnati in return for money from gamblers in what 
became known as the "Black Sox scandal." A jury found the players not guilty of 
attempting to "defraud the public," but Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis 
banned them from baseball for life. 
</P>
<P>
The ban has kept Jackson from being considered for the Hall of Fame -- an honor 
many think he deserves given his .356 average is the third highest on record. 
</P>
<P>
Passailaigue said his interest in Jackson was piqued recently by an article in 
a Charleston (S.C.) newspaper and the movie "Field of Dreams," which portrays 
Jackson as a resurrected hero.

Julie Rocheleau-Baumann, a Canadian hurdler, has been suspended for two years 
after a second test result indicated that she used steroids, the Canadian Track 
and Field Assn. announced. 
</P>
<P>
The association said it acted after the Sport Medicine Council of Canada had 
reported that a urine sample from Rocheleau-Baumann contained banned levels of 
stanozolol, the steroid used by sprinter Ben Johnson, who was banned for two 
years after testing positive at the Seoul Olympics.

A BUSY EVANS TO COMPETE IN MEET BEGINNING TODAY 
</P>

<P>
Janet Evans, who took very little time off after the Olympics in Seoul last 
September before getting back into her incredible training regimen, somehow 
managed to train, handle a crush of requests for appearances, parades and award 
dinners and still compete for Placentia's El Dorado High School and her 
Fullerton Aquatics Sports Team, knocking off distance swim records all along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
She's tough over the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
Today, just one day after her high school graduation ceremonies, Evans is 
opening her long-course season in the Swim Meet of Champions at Mission Viejo. 
Evans will swim the 800 at 4 p.m. and will compete every day in the meet that 
continues through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also plans to swim the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, 
200-meter breaststroke, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, 
400-meter individual medley and the 400-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Finals start at 5 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who will be attending Stanford in the fall and swimming there under the 
direction of Richard Quick, former Olympic coach and former women's coach at 
the University of Texas, has been working with Don Wagner, the new coach of her 
Fullerton Aquatics team. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, a former assistant at the University of Arizona, replaced Bud 
McAllister, who coached Evans to three Olympic gold medals before moving on to 
a club in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Evans broke the 1,650-yard freestyle record that had been set by 
Olympian Tiffany Cohen in 1983. She lowered it from 15 minutes 46.54 seconds to 
15:44.98. And in March, at the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming Short Course Nationals 
in Chapel Hill, N.C., she broke Cohen's American record in the 1,000-yard 
freestyle. She lowered that record from 9:28.32 to 9:25.49. 
</P>
<P>
It may take her a meet or two to get up to speed in this long-course season, 
but Evans is planning to compete in all the major meets. She is one of the 
stars that U.S. Swimming is planning to use both in Tokyo, at the Pan Pacific 
meet, and in Atlanta, against the Soviets, just days later. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone can do it . . . 
</P>
<P>
The annual meet at Mission Viejo has recently acquired Chrysler as a sponsor, 
which could mean that it will again be able to pay travel expenses for the top 
caliber swimmers who used to be attracted to the meet when it was sponsored by 
Seventeen magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the swimmers on the West Coast are competing either in the Santa Clara 
meet July 7-9 or in the Los Angeles Invitational July 13-16. East Coast 
swimmers will be competing in the Charlotte Ultra Swim Invitational June 22-25. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Invitational, which will be held at USC, has drawn not only 
Evans, but also Olympian Sylvia Poll of Costa Rica. USC Olympians Dave Wharton 
and Dan Jorgensen are also scheduled to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Invitational will be televised by TBS. 
</P>
<P>
All of the early summer meets are tuneups for the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming 
Long Course National Championships, which also will be held at USC, July 
31-Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Biondi is not ready to say when he plans to race again, but there is 
little doubt that he will. Somehow, somewhere and no doubt for some profit, 
Biondi will sprint against his old nemesis, Tom Jager. 
</P>
<P>
If Biondi chooses to skip the long-course national meet and, therefore, the Pan 
Pacific meet, it is likely that he will swim a match race with Jager -- a 
prospect that no doubt would attract network television. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi quit the national water polo team last week just before reporting to the 
Bahamas for the filming of a CBS project in which, of course, he swims with the 
dolphins he has grown to love. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi has not raced since his final Olympic event last September. He swam the 
butterfly leg for the 400-meter medley relay that won gold, and then announced 
that he would be putting all of his athletic efforts into making the national 
water polo team. 
</P>
<P>
Working with the water polo team has kept him in shape, and he would certainly 
be of value to the U.S. team -- especially on the relays -- if he did decide to 
qualify for the Pan Pacific meet. As Jeff Dimond of U.S. Swimming put it: "If 
Matt decides to swim again, we'll be turning cartwheels." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Hines will defend her title as women's champion in the United States Ten 
Mile Swim in this year's ocean race along a course that runs between Huntington 
Beach and Seal Beach. Hines is using the race to gain attention for her quest 
to make an endurance swim an Olympic event. 
</P>
<P>
She would like to see a 10-mile swim become a demonstration event in 1992 and a 
medal event by 1996. According to Hines, U.S. Swimming and its masters program 
have submitted the event for Olympic consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Endurance swimming deserves Olympic status," she says. "It is an international 
sport, it demands the highest levels of skill and training, and it is 
incredibly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
The United States sent a team of swimmers to the Soviet Union for a meet at 
Tallinn June 2-4 and the young women fared surprisingly well. They won nine 
gold medals, seven silver and one bronze in the 16 events, including an upset 
gold in the 400-meter medley relay. Pam Minthorn, 18, of Gaithersburg, Md., who 
swims for Curl-Burke Swim Club, won the 200-meter freestyle in 2:02.32, the 
100-meter butterfly in 1:01.5, and the 200-meter butterfly in 2:13.18. Summer 
Sanders, 16, of Roseville, who swims for the California Capital Aquatics, won 
both individual medleys. . . . Don Gambril has been named coach of the men's 
team and Dick Shoulberg has been named coach of the women's team for the Pan 
Pacific Games, the Alamo Cup and the World Cup meet to be held in Australia in 
January.

AGGRESSIVE BENT PUTS TAGLIAFERRI A CUT ABOVE REST

Asking Gino Tagliaferri to quantify his inventory of animosities would be 
difficult, sort of like handing a Band-Aid to a leper. There's so much to 
cover. Gee, Gino, where do we start? The top few, in no particular order: 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers: Tagliaferri's printable adjectives for this subspecies vary, but are 
usually along the lines of "loathsome" or "despicable." Tagliaferri once said 
that he "hates pitchers because they're the ones who make the game interesting 
or boring." Makes sense. If they strike him out, it's boring. If he hits it 
into the street beyond left field, well, you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Umpires: Tagliaferri was ejected from games twice as a sophomore and twice as a 
junior, so his objectivity is somewhat suspect. But Tagliaferri says theirs is 
a little lopsided, too. If a malevolent stare from the man in the mask is any 
indication, Tagliaferri might be right, but most of the time he asked for it. 
"I've said some things to some umps that, well, they'd just stare me down, 
hard," he says with a laugh. Tagliaferri once hit a home run that, after 
clearing the fence, slammed into the side of the plate umpire's parked car. 
Gino laughed, hard, when he found out who the owner was. 
</P>
<P>
Baseballs: Inanimate objects, to be sure, but nonetheless worthy of a large 
dose of Tagliaferri spite. Heck, since Tagliaferri hit a City Section-record 23 
home runs in three varsity seasons at Kennedy High, baseballs must be near the 
top of the scorn scale. "Tags" is not a nickname for a spray hitter. 
</P>
<P>
For Tagliaferri, a 5-foot-11, 190-pound shortstop, this aggressive stance is 
all a part of developing the winning edge, the thrill of the kill. When it 
comes time to bear down, Gino becomes part grizzly. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of all of the kids you've seen that have the talent, but when it comes 
time to suck it up, they just don't have it," he said. "Hell, yes, being 
aggressive is important." 
</P>
<P>
It has become his trademark. His powerful swing usually results in an 
extra-base hit or the air conditioning of the grandstands. And when he's not at 
the plate, he fans his competitive fires however he can. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as straightforward as they come," says Kennedy second baseman Pat DeBoer, 
a senior who has played with Tagliaferri on various youth teams since they were 
9 years old. "If he thinks the ump blew a call or somebody messed up, he lets 
you know. He speaks his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomacy be damned. Tagliaferri led the state in home runs with 13, 
establishing a City Section record, and his 23 career home runs is also a City 
mark. He ended his career with 91 runs batted in and a slugging percentage of 
.794. 
</P>
<P>
His team won the City 4-A Division title this year, its third title of the 
1980s. Tagliaferri was named the City 4-A Player of the Year on Tuesday, was 
drafted in the third round by the Detroit Tigers last week, has signed a letter 
of intent to play next year at Fresno State and dates a former Kennedy 
cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
He also is the first three-time member of The Times' All-Valley first team and 
is The Times' Valley Player of the Year for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The All-Valley, the All-City, being drafted, Fresno State . . . It's been a 
great year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Great and grating, just the way he likes it. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri lives a long home run or two from the Kennedy baseball field in 
Granada Hills. While a ninth-grader at Porter Junior High, Tagliaferri started 
dropping by Golden Cougar baseball practices. Soon, he was taking a few cuts. 
By his sophomore season, he already had made an impact as a designated-hitter, 
belting a team-high five homers and driving in 23 runs. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1987, Tagliaferri started opening eyes outside the Valley area. 
While playing against college competition on a scout team run by Chatsworth 
High Coach Bob Lofrano, Tagliaferri hit a pair of home runs at Loyola 
Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite impressive," Lofrano said. It was also a precursor of 
Tagliaferri's senior year, in which he had three two-homer games. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks before his junior season, Tagliaferri tangled with 1981 Kennedy 
graduate Phil Lombardi at the school's alumni game. Lombardi, now a first 
baseman for the New York Mets' triple-A affiliate in Tidewater, Va., and 
Tagliaferri squared off in a home run contest. DeBoer was the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a helluva sight," DeBoer said. "Phil grabs the cheapest aluminum bat 
we have and starts hitting them 500 feet and Gino's hitting them almost as 
far." 
</P>
<P>
After 10 swings, the two were tied. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a lot of pop," said Lombardi, who finally beat Tagliaferri in the 
third round of the competition. "When I was a senior, I think I hit two or 
three home runs all year. He was slamming them into the orchard, no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri again played for Lofrano's scout team last fall, and the Chatsworth 
coach immediately noticed a difference. Tagliaferri had tempered his tendency 
to lunge at the ball and had stopped trying to pull each pitch into left field. 
</P>
<P>
"This year he was real consistent," Lofrano said. "He became a line-drive 
hitter, he sat back on the ball and was more patient." 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano also envies Tagliaferri's line-drive style of play and leadership 
abilities. Had Chatsworth High had a player with Tagliaferri's hell-bent 
attitude, it might have put the Chancellors over the top, Lofrano said. 
</P>
<P>
"He brings his teammates up to another level of play," Lofrano said. "He's very 
vocal. (Chatsworth) didn't have the one guy this year who didn't care about 
your feelings, who let you know when you screwed up. He has that spark. We had 
a team of nice kids. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Nice" is rarely used to describe Tagliaferri after he crosses the lines. And 
don't cross Tagliaferri, especially if you're an umpire. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that's the Italian in me, and I regret that," Tagliaferri said. 
"That's one thing I really have to work on. I know I can do it, I don't believe 
in the word can't." 
</P>
<P>
Or shouldn't. In a recent playoff game, Tagliaferri was in rare form. Dale 
Carnegie he ain't. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tight game, we're battling, we're losing," Gino explained. "Their guy 
at the plate swings -- he breaks his wrists and everything -- and our catcher 
asks for help at first base. And no lie, the (umpire) is looking in the stands 
at some girl. He did not see the play. Everybody is staring at him, waiting for 
him, and he turns around and signals safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I get on first base later in the game and I really start on him. I said, 'Let 
me in on what's going on in your head. Is there a good-looking girl over there 
. . . or something? He says, 'Huh?' I said, 'Ever since that one call you blew 
in the third inning, your head's been in the stands. Hey, I'm just telling you 
to do the job you're being paid for.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I was being a total smart ass." 
</P>
<P>
The same umpire worked Kennedy's semifinal playoff game the following day. 
Tagliaferri approached the umpire before the game, shook his hand, then shook 
him up. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked up and said, 'Umpire, good luck, because you're gonna need it to keep 
your head in the game,' " Tagliaferri said, laughing. "He stared me down haaard 
all game." 
</P>
<P>
Said DeBoer: "Gino came back to the dugout and told a couple of us that he'd 
already started ragging the guy. He thought it was pretty funny." 
</P>
<P>
Some thought Tagliaferri's football exploits were rather humorous. Despite 
having no football experience before entering high school, Tagliaferri was the 
long snapper on punts and the kicker as a sophomore. As a junior, he tried out 
for -- surprise -- quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them right off that I wasn't really a quarterback, I never pretended to 
be that good," he said. "I just thought I could provide some leadership out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Bob Francola was soon won over by Tagliaferri's overall attitude 
and raw talent. Or was that raw attitude and overall talent? 
</P>
<P>
"With one-tenth the work, he was nearly as good as the two other guys we had 
out there," Francola said. "And he figured to improve, so I went with Gino." 
</P>
<P>
The gamble didn't pay off. In six games, Tagliaferri completed 14 of 42 
attempts (33%) for 146 yards. He threw four interceptions, one touchdown pass 
and absorbed a ton of punishment. "If I had it to do all over again, I'd put 
him at wide receiver," Francola said. "He'd have been a game-breaker." 
</P>
<P>
Francola sees the same characteristics on the baseball field. "He likes 
crushing the ball, he likes getting his nose in the dirt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, Tagliaferri seems headed to where there's a snootful of soil -- 
the central San Joaquin Valley. Talks broke down with Detroit last week, so it 
appears Tagliaferri will be headed to the land of good ol' boys. He should fit 
right in -- he already drives a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
"We get him a pair of boots and he's all set," Fresno State Coach Bob Bennett 
cracked. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri, 18, will attempt to fill the Tony Lamas of All-American shortstop 
Eddie Zosky, a junior who last week was drafted in the first round by Toronto. 
After graduating from St. Paul High in Santa Fe Springs in 1986, Zosky turned 
down a substantial offer from the Mets after being drafted in the fifth round. 
Tagliaferri appears poised to take the same route. 
</P>
<P>
"They're already saying Gino might be another Zosky," Bennett said. "I don't 
know if he's another Zosky defensively -- Eddie's more of a finesse player -- 
but Gino has as good a set of stats as anybody we've had in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said that Tagliaferri will play at short, third or second. "I think a 
guy like Gino could definitely start as a freshman," he said. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, Tagliaferri must meet the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s 
requirement by scoring at least a 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or risk 
losing a year of eligibility. Tagliaferri again took the SAT on June 3 after 
failing in his first three attempts. As insurance, he took the American College 
Testing (ACT) exam Saturday. Bennett said that Tagliaferri is welcome at Fresno 
State next season whether he is eligible or not. 
</P>
<P>
"It embarrasses me when people ask me about it," said Tagliaferri, who says he 
has a grade-point average of 2.8. "But I feel I'll get through it." 
</P>
<P>
Once Tagliaferri gets there, he's confident he'll catch on fast. In fact, he's 
practically sure of it. 
</P>
<P>
"College pitching is much better," he said. "It's not hard to hit a ball when 
it's around the plate -- in high school, you don't know where the ball's gonna 
be. I strongly believe I'll be real successful and that I'll improve at Fresno 
State or wherever." 
</P>
<P>
It's probably just as well that Tagliaferri chose not to sign with Detroit. 
When asked what he knew about the Tigers, he answered: "Not much -- Kirk 
Gibson." 
</P>
<P>
Kindred spirits, to be sure. Both former football players, volatile types, 
nitro in spikes. Of course, even for a self-described hard guy, emotion can 
sometimes be a two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
"At our team banquet, I gave about a 20-minute speech about how I felt," 
Tagliaferri said. "I thanked my parents, my friends, my girlfriend, coaches. 
Hell, I thanked everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it sort of hit me, and all of a sudden, I broke down. I started crying -- 
not bawling -- but I got real choked up." 
</P>
<P>
Mixed emotions about escaping from high school? This guy? It seems that unlike 
a belt-high fastball, he wasn't ready to kiss it goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was because it all went so fast, boom, it was gone," he said. "We 
won that (4-A title), and I wanted to enjoy it one more time. High school goes 
fast, you know that, we all know that. Now it's out into the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody alert Fresno.

<TEXT>
<P>
Manny Alvarado 
</P>
<P>
KENNEDY 
</P>
<P>
As an assistant at San Fernando last year, Alvarado made a trip to the City 
Section 4-A Division championship baseball game at Dodger Stadium with the 
Tigers. When he was hired at Kennedy a month later, he said he hoped his wait 
for a return visit would be a short one. How about one season? In his first 
year as a varsity coach, Alvarado, 35, won a City title, leading the Golden 
Cougars to the 4-A crown with a 4-3 win over Palisades. Not bad for a guy who 
didn't coach at a high school for eight years until he returned to San Fernando 
in 1988. This year he led Kennedy to a 22-7 record and the North Valley League 
title. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLAYER OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
Gino Tagliaferri 
</P>
<P>
KENNEDY 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri, 5-11, 190-pound shortstop, is a three-time All-Valley selection 
who capped a spectacular career with a record-setting season. He cracked 13 
home runs to lead the state and set a single-season City Section record. His 
three-year career total of 23 is also a City record and places him in a tie for 
fifth on the state list. In leading the Golden Cougars to City and North Valley 
League titles, he batted .365 and had a slugging percentage of .875. Of his 35 
hits, 25 went for extra bases. He was selected in the third round by the 
Detroit Tigers in baseball's amateur draft and has signed a letter of intent 
with Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PITCHER OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
Roger Salkeld 
</P>
<P>
SAUGUS 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld's career was capped when the Seattle Mariners made him the No. 3 pick 
in the nation in baseball's amateur draft. The 6-foot-5, 210-pound, 
hard-throwing right-hander was 13-1 with an 0.57 earned-run average and had 178 
strikeouts in 108 1/3 innings. His three-year totals: A 30-7 record with 404 
strikeouts and a 1.31 ERA in 266 1/3 innings. Salkeld hurled his only no-hitter 
last month against Canyon and led the Centurions to their fifth Golden League 
title and the Southern Section 3-A Division championship game. Saugus was 
defeated by La Palma Kennedy, 1-0, when Salkeld uncorked a ninth-inning wild 
pitch. But two days later, draft day gave Salkeld reason to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIRST TEAM 
</P>
<P>
Javier Delahoya P 
</P>
<P>
GRANT 
</P>
<P>
6-2, 170 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
The East Valley League MVP became the first Valley-area high school player to 
sign a professional contract when he accepted a $40,000 offer from the Dodgers 
last week. He was selected in the fourth round in baseball's amateur draft. 
Delahoya was 9-1 with a 1.93 ERA and struck out 99 in 76 innings. He also 
batted .379 with five home runs and 27 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Derek Wallace P 
</P>
<P>
CHATSWORTH 
</P>
<P>
6-3, 170 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander is a repeat selection from last season and one of four 
Chancellors selected in the amateur draft. He likely will pass up an offer from 
the Pittsburgh Pirates to play at Pepperdine next season. The West Valley 
League MVP posted a 9-3 record with a 1.92 ERA. He batted .344 with four home 
runs, 22 RBIs and stole 10 bases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casey Burrill C 
</P>
<P>
HART 
</P>
<P>
6-3, 210 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
In the year of the catcher, the All-Valley team carries two of the top high 
school catchers in the state with Burrill and Bobby Hughes. Burrill led Hart's 
drive to the Southern Section 4-A title game with a .453 average and also hit 
six home runs. He had 39 RBIs to tie for most in the Valley area. Drafted by 
the Pirates, Burrill will likely attend USC in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bobby Hughes C 
</P>
<P>
NOTRE DAME 
</P>
<P>
6-3, 210 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes nearly matched Burrill's statistics. He batted .400 with eight doubles, 
three triples, three home runs and 38 RBIs. Hughes, who has signed with Loyola 
Marymount, had an even bigger impact on defense. In the playoffs, he threw out 
Cerritos shortstop Robert Hinds, who is headed to UCLA, and was three for three 
against Lakewood baserunners. 
</P>

<P>
6-5, 185 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Tagliaferri, Aude was the most devastating hitter in the Valley area. 
He batted .454 and led the area with 45 hits. He slugged six home runs, scored 
31 runs and tied Burrill for the lead in RBIs with 39. Aude, who has signed 
with UC Santa Barbara, was drafted by Pittsburgh in the second round to become 
the highest selection in school history.

</P>
<P>
SAN FERNANDO

<P>
5-8, 165 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Corrales set a school record for RBIs with 34 and batted .385. He also set an 
unofficial record in a new category instituted by Coach Steve Marden: hitting 
in the clutch. In 51 at-bats with runners in scoring position, Corrales had 23 
hits -- a .451 average. Corrales struck out only twice in 91 at-bats. Corrales 
was not drafted and may sign with Cal Lutheran.

<P>
5-11, 183 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who batted under .200 last season at Loyola, exploded after transferring 
to Chatsworth. He batted .391, scored a Valley-area high 44 runs, hit three 
home runs and had 28 RBIs. His 27 stolen bases led City Section Valley players. 
He also posted a 3-1 record with a 2.92 ERA. He has signed with Cal and was 
drafted in the fourth round by the Cubs.

<P>
KENNEDY 
</P>
<P>
5-10, 150 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy averaged more than eight runs a game en route to the City 4-A title and 
the switch-hitting Murray got the offense rolling from his leadoff spot. He 
batted .411 and walked 32 times for an on-base percentage of .566. He scored 36 
runs, drove in 29 and also showed some power with three home runs. He likely 
will play at Valley College next season.

CLEVELAND 
</P>
<P>
5-11, 180 
</P>
<P>
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
One of only two juniors on the All-Valley team, Bryant was the only player from 
a team that failed to make the playoffs to earn All-City 4-A honors. The 
quick-footed center fielder batted .464 with five doubles, two triples and four 
home runs. He knocked in only 14 runs as the leadoff hitter but stole 21 bases. 
His father, Derek, played for Oakland in 1979.

5-11, 175 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been a down year by Poly's lofty standards -- the Parrots lost in 
the first round of the 4-A playoffs -- but no one can blame Chavez. He batted 
.397 and set a school record with six home runs, good for second place among 
Valley City players. He also had four saves to share the lead among Valley City 
players. He will play at Canyons next season. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Notre Dame averaged nearly 10 runs a game and Lohman led the attack with a .472 
average. He hit four triples, four home runs, had 35 RBIs and stole 15 bases. 
He was 3-1 as a pitcher and was co-MVP of the San Fernando Valley League. 
Lohman, drafted by Oakland in the 56th round, is considering offers from UCLA, 
UC Santa Barbara and Gonzaga.

<P>
Although he hit only one home run, Migita accounted for 70 runs in a 30-game 
season. He was one of only three Valley-area players to score at least 40 runs, 
and he drove in 31. He was second in the area with 13 doubles, hit three 
triples and stole 12 bases. Together with a .435 batting average, Migita has a 
tough act to follow next season -- his own.

TAFT

<P>
5-10, 155 
</P>
<P>
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Taft reached the City 4-A playoffs for the first time since 1980 and Nahmias 
was one of the key ingredients. He batted .424 with nine doubles, two triples 
and three home runs. He also knocked in 26 runs and was an All-City selection. 
A solid student, he has gained admission to Cal on academic merit and has been 
invited to try out as a walk-on.

Previously known as Chris Romo's younger brother, Nino ended his career as this 
season's leading hitter among Valley City players with a .471 average. He had 
four doubles and 15 RBIs. He also led Sylmar to the East Valley League title as 
the team's top pitcher with a 9-3 record and 2.86 ERA. He plans to join his 
brother Chris at Mission College in the fall.

U.S. EXECUTIVES TOO PAROCHIAL, SURVEY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
U.S. corporations will continue to lose ground to foreign competitors in world 
markets because of shortcomings in the nation's executive ranks and the rest of 
its work force, according to a major new study. 
</P>
<P>
The report -- based on a survey of about 1,500 top managers worldwide by 
executive recruiters Korn/Ferry International and the Columbia University 
business school -- faulted Americans for minimizing the value of learning 
foreign languages and cultures. Executives in Japan, Western Europe and Latin 
America, on the other hand, were found to place a high priority on 
multilingualism. 
</P>
<P>
"These results," said the report, "provide a poignant indication of national 
differences that promise to influence profoundly the success of American 
corporations. The insularity of U.S. attitudes toward international business 
and international communications . . . points to a continuation of America's 
lagging competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"By discounting the importance of an international outlook, of multilingualism 
and of foreign assignments," the report continued, "our U.S. respondents gave 
expression to a parochialism that can only inhibit opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The study, which projected economic conditions in the year 2000, said that a 
shortage of U.S. senior managers prepared to run global businesses will 
translate into "the highest level of executive turnover in history." 
</P>
<P>
"The shortage of talented executives with the abilities and background 
necessary to run global businesses will soon become a major theme of human 
resource management, and human resource management will become the most 
significant challenge facing business," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, only 2% of U.S. executives believe that knowledge of 
foreign languages will be a very important business factor in 2000. Among 
Japanese executives, the figure was 13% -- despite the fact that their foreign 
language skills, in general, already surpass those of their American 
counterparts, the authors of the study said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Warren Bennis, a USC business professor who has written books on 
executive leadership, said the study's assessment on that score does not square 
with what he has found at most of the nation's largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I see tremendous change in the mind-set of executives at top companies about 
the importance of international understanding and language skills," Bennis 
said, "and that awareness is increasing all the time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Coming Up Short' 
</P>
<P>
Americans responding to the survey, who accounted for 44% of those polled, 
expressed more concern about the quality of the U.S. work force than in top 
executives' foreign language skills. Asked to predict their competitive 
advantages in the year 2000, only 4.8% of the Americans cited "availability of 
qualified personnel." In contrast, 9.3% of the Japanese respondents saw their 
country's labor pool as an important future asset. 
</P>
<P>
"American education, training and development are seen as coming up short in 
the business world," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In another section of the report, the respondents -- representing corporations 
that produce about 10% of the world's goods and services -- said they believe 
that the United States' economic and political power will decline substantially 
during the next decade. For example, 69.5% said the United States was the most 
economically powerful nation in 1988, but only 45.2% believe that it still will 
be in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the United States came out narrowly ahead of Japan as the nation most 
likely to be the world's economic leader in 2000. The study found that 39.8% of 
the executives believe that Japan will hold that position at the beginning of 
the next century. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that we are in for several decades of shared leadership in the 
business world," said Lester Korn, chairman of Los Angeles-based Korn/Ferry. 
"That would mean more joint ventures by multinational corporations." 
</P>
<P>
Japan will be gaining economic ground in world markets over the next 11 years, 
according to the respondents. However, Japanese executives believe that they 
are likely to lose some of their domestic market to foreign firms, according to 
the study. Of all the nationalities represented in the survey, Japanese 
executives expressed the most concern about the prospect of competition on the 
home front.

BULLY ON THE LINE?;

COMPETITORS ARE ACCUSING PAC BELL OF 'PREDATORY' PRACTICES -- AND STATE 
REGULATORS ARE LISTENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For about two months now, Pacific Bell has offered voice mail, an electronic 
telephone-answering service, to its customers in San Pedro and in the Silicon 
Valley community of Milpitas. But already a competing voice-mail company, Amvox 
Inc., has accused Pacific Bell of "anti-competitive behavior" through its 
monopoly hold on local telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
Amvox pointed out in a complaint filed last month with the California Public 
Utilities Commission that Pacific Bell encourages customers interested in the 
new service to call a toll-free, seven-digit number for information. 
Competitors such as Amvox can match that convenience only by leasing costly 
toll-free service from its competitor, Pacific Bell -- and even then the call 
requires dialing 11 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Pacific Bell is offering a free message-taking service to launch its 
voice mail system -- a practice Amvox called "predatory," or pricing a service 
at below cost to drive out competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I really am not worried about them as an equal competitor," said Harry 
Schwedock, chief operating officer of Amvox, a unit of Amway that claims 41,000 
customers in California. "But I am very worried about them with the playing 
field as tilted as it is." 
</P>
<P>
While Pacific Bell denies Amvox's allegations, many entrepreneurs seeking a 
foothold in emerging competitive areas of the telecommunications business find 
that the complaint has a familiar ring. Critics say that Pacific Bell and other 
regional phone companies have repeatedly abused their monopoly position to 
squeeze potential competitors in unregulated businesses. 
</P>
<P>
And the complaints are growing louder as the PUC considers loosening its 
regulation of Pacific Bell and GTE California, a move that the newcomers say 
would open the door to further competitive abuses as long as they control 
telephone access to customers. Although deregulation proposals have been put 
forward ostensibly to stimulate competition, opponents argue that relaxing 
oversight of Pacific Bell and GTE would free them to bully struggling young 
entrants to the fast-evolving telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they urge adoption of toughened regulations that would require the two 
local giants to keep their monopoly on basic telephone service entirely 
separate from new offerings, such as voice mail and information services, to 
keep the big companies from having an unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who voiced their concerns during a special hearing last week of the 
Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee were: 
</P>
<P>
* Telephone-equipment repairers who groused that Pacific Bell's Yellow Pages 
directories are filled with ads plugging its own repair service, ads that 
competitors would have to pay dearly for. 
</P>
<P>
* Home-security companies, dependent on local phone lines to connect customers 
to the firms' alarm-monitoring networks, which disputed Pacific Bell's claims 
that their phone connections are far below cost and therefore their rates 
should be doubled or more. 
</P>
<P>
* Cable television companies, which cited a long history of "unreasonable" rent 
charged by local phone companies for use of their poles to string TV cable, 
disputes that already have resulted in federal legislation and some state 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Such concerns over the future of competition in the fast-changing world of 
telecommunications are coming to a head after months of PUC hearings examining 
alternative ways to regulate local phone companies. These alternatives seek to 
give Pacific Bell and GTE California greater flexibility in setting prices, to 
shorten the time needed to offer new services and to create stronger incentives 
for innovation by ending limits on profitability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T Gets Some Freedom 
</P>
<P>
The PUC and the Federal Communications Commission have already given American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the nation's dominant long-distance phone company, 
some freedom in setting its long-distance prices. Similarly, the PUC granted 
Pacific Bell freedom to negotiate rates for certain switching and high-speed 
transmission services with major business customers. 
</P>
<P>
But even AT&amp;T and its chief long-distance competitors -- MCI and U.S Sprint 
-- depend on local phone companies to reach their customers. And they joined 
the smaller and newer telecommunications firms in opposing proposals offered by 
Pacific Bell and GTE California, pointing out that the phone companies' 
monopoly on local connections represents a "bottleneck" through which all 
telecommunications services must flow. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not against competition" from the phone companies, said Jerry O'Brien, 
director of telecommunications for API Alarm Systems in Culver City. "We're 
against unfair competition. A monopoly service should be regulated. But if 
there's competition, if it's not a monopoly, then it should be a separate 
entity." 
</P>
<P>
A separate company would then have to buy and pay for network services on the 
same basis as other companies, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell has proposed scrapping the PUC's present trial-like procedure for 
establishing telephone prices and policies. This procedure establishes service 
costs and adds a maximum profit, then computes the utility's annual revenue 
needs and sets its rates accordingly. The Pacific Bell plan would put these 
"general rate cases" on hold for three years while freezing residential rates 
and giving the company some freedom to increase or lower prices for business 
services. 
</P>
<P>
GTE California's proposal also would suspend rate hearings and impose rate 
caps, although somewhat differently. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC Division of Ratepayer Advocates has developed another alternative -- 
the only one that calls for a general rate cut before any freezing of 
residential prices. "A rate freeze is of no great advantage to rate-payers if 
they are entitled to a reduction," observed division director Terry Murray. A 
rate cut is overdue, she said, because basic telephone costs have been 
declining with improved technology that has been paid for by customers. But 
after "getting the starting point right," she added, the division would 
consider proposals to split with company shareholders and customers what now 
would be designated as "excess earnings" subject to refund. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC's hearing officer exploring these regulatory alternatives, 
Administrative Law Judge Charlotte Ford, said she expects to complete her 
recommendations in midsummer. If so, the commission could decide the issue in 
September. All five PUC commissioners were appointed by Gov. Deukmejian, and 
are considered to be sympathetic toward deregulating telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have a big stake in our state's telecommunications policies," 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) said at the opening of last week's 
hearing by the utilities and commerce committee, which she heads. "They will 
determine, more than we can imagine today, how we will live our lives 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's committee was told repeatedly that competition in telecommunications 
services is essential to bring the full benefits of the so-called information 
age to California. But true competition, those testifying said, hinges on tough 
regulation that prevents anti-competitive practices, such as allowing Pacific 
Bell and GTE to subsidize their new businesses with profits from their phone 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"All the (anti-competitive) problems are resolved by separating" the old 
businesses from the new ones at the big phone companies, asserted Schwedock of 
Amvox. But without strict separation, abuses are inevitable, maintained Dennis 
E. Love, president of Extension Connection in Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
Love formed Extension Connection in 1985 to repair telephone wiring inside 
homes and small businesses when that field was deregulated, but he has seen his 
dream of creating a nationwide franchise of independent repair services fade in 
the face of costly litigation with Pacific Bell. Love's original fleet of nine 
trucks has shrunk to two, and his office now has moved from spacious rented 
quarters to his own home. 
</P>
<P>
Central to his problems, he insists, was the printing of a wrong telephone 
number by Pacific Bell's Yellow Pages subsidiary two years ago in $25,000 worth 
of ads he placed in the utility's Marin County and San Francisco directories. 
After months of negotiations with Pacific Bell's lawyers, Love won a settlement 
for an amount he considers to have been far less than what his publicly traded 
company lost in business and hefty legal expenses. Then this year's directories 
appeared last month with Extension Connection's ad left out, "inadvertently," 
according to Pacific Bell Directory. 
</P>
<P>
Schwedock understands such frustrations among colleagues trying to compete 
against the big regional companies, telling Moore's committee: 
</P>
<P>
"When we have a competitor to whom we pay over 35% of our revenues for services 
essential to our business, when we have a competitor who has no need to raise 
capital, when we have a competitor who has more lawyers than we have employees, 
when we have a competitor who has a long record of anti-competitive abuses, we 
worry."

HILTON TO HIRE FINANCIAL ADVISER; RUMORS OF BID FUEL SHARE PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
As Hilton Hotels' stock rode a tide of rumors about an extravagant bid for the 
company from Asian suitors, the Beverly Hills-based firm said Wednesday that it 
will hire a financial adviser to help it "optimize stockholder value." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement dropped another shoe in Hilton's corporate drama. The first 
was kicked off May 12 at the annual stockholders' meeting, when Chairman Barron 
Hilton announced that the company was not seeking a buyer but would consider 
any purchase offers. Barron Hilton had just come into voting control of 34% of 
the firm's stock after a 10-year legal struggle over his father's estate. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton's stock price, which was trading at about $65.50 just before the 
chairman's comment, has since risen about $30 a share, including $7.50 in the 
last two days. The stock closed Wednesday at $95.125, up $3.125, in heavy 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it hit a new high of $98 before 
subsiding. The stock rose $4.375 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of this week's market speculation in Hilton stock, a rumored offer 
of $134 a share by a Japanese company was cited by a New Jersey firm that 
provides telephone tips over a special 900 number. Elsewhere, rumors of a 
$120-a-share bid also have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy A. Judge, assistant to Barron Hilton, said Wednesday that the company 
"won't comment on that type of speculation," adding that "we prefer not to 
contribute to the chaos that these rumors (set off) on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Judge said the company will select a financial adviser in the next week to 10 
days. It is expected that the adviser will delve into such questions as whether 
to sell all or part of the company. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility would be the sale of Hilton's hotels except for its lucrative 
Nevada hotel-casino resorts. In the past, Barron Hilton has shown a high regard 
for the hotel-casinos, which for years have brought in a disproportionately 
large share of corporation profits. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton owns and operates 14 hotels, including the Waldorf Astoria in New York 
and the Las Vegas and Flamingo Hiltons in Nevada, and manages 34 others that 
are partly or wholly owned by others. Four of the hotels have gambling 
operations. Three of them are company-owned and are in Nevada, and the fourth, 
in Australia, is partly owned by Hilton. Hilton filings show the hotel-casinos 
accounted for about 53% of the company's total income in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Specific Inquiries' 
</P>
<P>
Barron Hilton, who also is chief executive, said the firm's board at a regular 
meeting Wednesday authorized one of its committees to retain the financial 
adviser to evaluate various strategies. "The exercise of prudent judgment," 
said the executive, "dictates that the company fully examine the various 
alternatives which can serve to benefit our stockholders while preserving 
corporate objectives." 
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting was not precipitated over any "specific inquiries or 
contacts between the company and third parties." 
</P>
<P>
His assistant, Judge, later said the company has received some "expressions of 
interest" but no "firm offers." Because of such expressions, he said, the board 
"thought it prudent to retain an adviser to give some guidance." He added that 
there are "several alternatives besides selling." While he did not detail the 
alternatives, Judge confirmed that one would be selling part of the company's 
assets.

BOESKY ASSOCIATE INDICTED ON 42 STOCK FRAUD CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Former stock speculator John A. Mulheren, arrested last year for allegedly 
threatening the life of fallen arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, was indicted 
Wednesday on 42 federal counts of securities fraud, conspiracy and other 
charges stemming from his business dealings with Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Manhattan charged the flamboyant Mulheren, 39, of 
manipulating the stock of Gulf &amp; Western Inc. -- recently renamed Paramount 
Communications -- so that Boesky would profit by selling a huge block of its 
stock to the company. The indictment also accused Mulheren of carrying on a 
series of sham stock transactions with Boesky to enable Boesky to evade taxes 
and avoid government rules requiring investors to maintain minimal levels of 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
In return for these favors, Mulheren received secret inside stock information 
from Boesky, the indictment said, which he presumably used to make money 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested Carrying Assault Rifle 
</P>
<P>
Also indicted was Leonard DeStefano, a trader who worked for Mulheren at his 
now-defunct Wall Street firm, Jamie Securities. DeStefano was charged with 
conspiracy, securities fraud and maintaining false records. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street was jolted in February, 1988, to hear that the ace arbitrager had 
been arrested with an Israeli assault rifle after threatening the life of 
Boesky and Boesky's chief trader, Michael Davidoff. Mulheren, once a close 
friend of Boesky, had feared that Boesky's cooperation with prosecutors in the 
unfolding insider trading scandal would lead them to him, authorities said at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Felony Charges to Come 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren, who has been undergoing psychiatric treatment since the arrest, is 
expected soon to face state criminal charges in addition to those brought 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors in New Jersey are expected to charge him with two felony 
counts: illegal possession of a firearm, and possession of a firearm with 
intent to cause harm, according to Benito Romano, the acting U.S. attorney in 
Manhattan. He said federal prosecutors plan to dismiss pending charges of 
threatening a federal witness, as soon as New Jersey authorities bring their 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 42 federal counts is punishable by five years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren's attorney, Thomas Puccio, said his client would plead not guilty. The 
charges, he said, "have been around for two years and, like Ivan Boesky's 
credibility, they don't get better with age." 
</P>
<P>
Defendant DeStefano could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Mulheren set out to manipulate Gulf &amp; 
Western's stock on Oct. 17, 1985, after the company agreed that it would 
repurchase Boesky's huge 3.47-million-share block if the price reached $45 a 
share. Mulheren put in three large orders for the stock and succeeded in 
raising the price to $45 from $44.75. 
</P>
<P>
This manipulation "defrauded the investors in Jamie Securities, the management 
of Gulf &amp; Western and the investing public," Romano said. 
</P>
<P>
As Boesky sold his block to Gulf &amp; Western, a second, unidentified investor 
sold a second block of 3.23 million shares to the company. Prosecutors declined 
to explain why this investor's identity was concealed. 
</P>
<P>
They also would not comment on Gulf &amp; Western's motives in buying back the 
block, which they valued at $156 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paramount Cooperated 
</P>
<P>
The company may have agreed to buy Boesky's shares to get rid of a potentially 
threatening shareholder; Gulf &amp; Western earlier bought a large block of 
stock held by corporate raider Carl Lindner, at the market price. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of its purchase from Boesky, the company explained the heavy volume 
by announcing that the transaction was part of a share buyback program. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement Wednesday, Paramount would only say that it had cooperated 
fully with prosecutors. "As the indictment states, the alleged manipulation of 
our stock was concealed from us," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said Mulheren and Boesky's company, Seemala Corp., on a series 
of occasions planned transactions that would make it appear that Jamie 
Securities had bought shares from Boesky. But Seemala maintained the right to 
repurchase the shares and to take any profits that would accrue during the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Seemala agreed to make up any losses that Jamie incurred if the shares declined 
in price while Mulheren held them. Jamie Securities repaid Boesky his profits 
with inflated bills for brokerage services it had purportedly received from 
Seemala; also, it sold Boesky 500,000 shares of Beatrice securities at an 
inflated price, the indictment alleged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mulheren Must Take Lithium 
</P>
<P>
The indictment didn't say how much Boesky earned from the transactions, and it 
gave no hint of the value of Boesky's tips to Mulheren. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren is currently free on a $20-million personal recognizance bond secured 
by his two homes, which are located in Rumson, N.J., and near Roanoke, Va. 
Under a complicated bail arrangement, Mulheren must have his blood checked 
weekly to assure that he is continuing to take lithium, a drug prescribed for 
psychiatric patients, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
He must consult regularly with his psychiatrist, cannot contact any witnesses 
in the case and is sharply limited in his movements.

CHINA'S TURMOIL HAS HONG KONG WORRIED; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO, WHICH HAS BEEN BOOMING, IS AT STAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Every day, 25,000 trucks cross the border between Hong Kong and the southern 
Chinese province of Guangdong, carrying components and partly assembled 
products that have helped turn the economies of those adjacent and economically 
interdependent areas into booming success stories. 
</P>
<P>
Now, makers of toys, electronics, textiles and other products based in Hong 
Kong and other business centers are waiting to see whether the eruptions in 
Beijing lead to damaging changes in government policies and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows what is going to happen in the next couple of weeks," says Danny 
Cheong, a senior executive of Maio &amp; W. (China), a Hong Kong company that 
makes handbags in Dongguan City, one of Guangdong's most successful industrial 
centers. "At present, the Guangdong government officials are operating on their 
old orders, waiting to see if there are any new rules." 
</P>
<P>
Confidence and economic prospects in Hong Kong would be seriously hit by a 
setback in Guangdong, which has benefited more than any other part of China 
from the open-door policies of the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some Hong Kong companies that rely on Guangdong for cheap labor and readily 
available industrial sites would probably collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1.5 million and 3 million Guangdong workers, supplied by Chinese 
government agencies, are employed by more than 60,000 Hong Kong companies in 
factories stitching hair into plastic dolls' heads, assembling toy railway 
sets, laminating circuit boards and producing soft drinks, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
At least 300,000 come from other parts of China. They are mostly young girls 
earning about $80 to $160 (300 to 600 Chinese yuan) a month, well above the 
roughly $40 (150 yuan) paid by state industrial companies but far below the 
$400 (1,500 yuan) or more that the companies would have to pay in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creating Envy 
</P>
<P>
The development of Guangdong, which includes three of China's four special 
economic zones, has been personally backed by Zhao Ziyang, the former Chinese 
Communist Party leader. Guangdong has become China's most prosperous and 
freewheeling province. 
</P>
<P>
But this has created envy in Beijing and elsewhere, and there has been 
outspoken criticism of the area's independence and its life style. Thus, Zhao's 
fall from power in this month's political upheaval could lead to a clampdown on 
Guangdong and the purging of some liberal-minded officials. 
</P>
<P>
The economy is so open that Hong Kong dollars are widely and officially 
accepted; some local people estimate that as many as 20% of all Hong Kong's 
currency notes are in use there. 
</P>
<P>
In the special economic zone of Shenzhen, which is the most capitalist-oriented 
area, officials recently were even preparing capitalist-style laws culled from 
Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and the United States covering areas such as 
company structures, bankruptcy, taxation and labor. 
</P>
<P>
The province has absorbed 45% of all foreign investment going into China. About 
70% of its $1.5 billion in foreign capital comes from or has been routed 
through Hong Kong. This comprises direct investment in joint ventures as well 
as wholly foreign-owned projects, including a float-glass plant from the United 
States, Peugeot cars from France and various electronics companies from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
These figures do not include the 60,000 businesses connected with the 
processing work where materials or parts are sent from or through Hong Kong, 
then sent back as finished or semi-finished goods. 
</P>
<P>
This traffic last year accounted for 73% of Hong Kong's $4.9 billion in 
domestic exports to China. It also accounted for 35% to 40% of Hong Kong's 
$12.2 billion in re-exports to China of unfinished goods brought into Hong Kong 
from elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government recently said Guangdong's production was rising at an 
annual rate of 25% so far this year. A senior Shenzhen official said last 
weekend that the favorable foreign investment climate there would continue. 
There have been some disruptions and protests at government-owned factories 
during the current turmoil over China's violent suppression of a student-led 
movement for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
But executives such as Cheong of Maio and Aaron Lo of Tootal China, a spinoff 
of a British company that runs a factory in Guangdong, report few problems 
apart from occasional transport blockages and delays in supplies from China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Changes Possible 
</P>
<P>
Many companies were hit last week when there were reports that the border on 
the China side of the Shenzhen customs-free zone had been closed. The report 
proved false, but some Hong Kong truck drivers have become unwilling to drive 
very far past the border and into Guangdong. For most of last week, there were 
more trucks leaving China than entering it. 
</P>
<P>
Few if any people here believe that China will close its doors to outside 
businesses, but there could be policy changes that will drive out much of 
Guangdong's economic dynamism. There could also be a purge of officials or a 
crackdown on corruption that would curb such lucrative practices as 
under-invoicing or receiving bribes for official favors. In addition, railway 
problems might impede coal supplies to power stations, worsening already 
serious electricity shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Guangdong officials visited Hong Kong recently to stress to Hopewell Holdings, 
a local company involved in road and power-station projects across the border, 
that they do not want work to stop. That illustrates the interrelationship 
between the two places that neither side wants to see ended, whatever may 
happen in Beijing.

AIRLINES GROUND MOST OF WORLD'S BOEING 737-400S

<P>
International airlines Wednesday acted to ground most of the worldwide fleet of 
Boeing 737-400s after three separate incidents, including the crash in Britain 
in January that cost 47 lives. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines' grounding of the aircraft followed a recommendation by Boeing Co. 
and CFM International that 33 of the world fleet of 50 737-400s should be taken 
out of service for modifications to their engines -- the CFM 56-3C. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time a Boeing fleet has ever been grounded. This is a major 
problem," Boeing's Paris spokesman, Sandrik de Couriss, said at the Paris Air 
Show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fundamental' Problem 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Midland Airways, which has two Boeing 737-400s and also 
operated the aircraft which crashed in Kegworth, Leicestershire, said it 
regarded the problems as "fundamental." It would seek a long-term solution 
before calling for the aircraft to be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the affected aircraft operated by U.K. airlines were grounded by the 
Civil Aviation Authority on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The engines were also used on two airliners, operated by Dan-Air and British 
Midland Airways, which were involved in scares last weekend when fan blades 
failed on flights from Heathrow and Gatwick. The 17 aircraft not affected are 
in service in the United States and use a different version of the CFM engine 
that has less thrust.

Iacocca Calls for Less Sex, Violence on TV: Lee A. Iacocca told television 
executives to start censoring their shows or advertisers, including his own 
Chrysler Corp., may pull their commercials. The Chrysler chairman said viewers 
are tired of trash TV and are venting their rage on the big advertisers with 
angry letters and boycotts. "I don't want to be the censor, I want you to do 
it," he said in an address to the Hollywood Radio &amp; Television Society. He 
said the networks should tone down the "bedroom bingo" and violence and provide 
more balance to controversial issues. Iacocca warned that companies such as 
Chrysler, which spends $250 million a year on television, could withdraw 
advertising from objectionable programming if steps are not taken to tone down 
the sex and violence.

TIME'S LIMBO FUELS LOBBYING, SPECULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The suspense over Time Inc.'s future continued to color Wall Street trading and 
Washington rhetoric as yet another day passed without action by Time's board on 
a hostile bid by Paramount Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the 12-member Time board is likely to meet today, however, to 
discuss how -- or whether -- Time will try to salvage its plan to merge with 
Warner Communications. Until Paramount made its surprise $175-a-share offer 
last week, both Time and Warner had expected their stock-swap proposal to be 
approved by shareholders at meetings on June 23. So far, neither Time nor 
Warner has canceled its meeting. 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, traders' attention turned anew to Paramount and Warner, which 
ranked second and third, respectively, on the New York Stock Exchange's most 
active list. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount rose $1.75 to close at $59.50, with nearly 4 million shares -- or 
almost 3.4% of its capitalization -- changing hands. Warner rose 75 cents to 
close at $55 on a volume of 2.5 million shares -- about 1.5% of its common 
shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter to FCC 
</P>
<P>
One investment banker, who gives Time and Warner "less than zero" chance of 
proceeding with their original deal, wagered that Time is "trying to 
orchestrate a bid for Paramount" to unnerve the hostile bidder. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, lobbying was evident at both the Federal 
Communications Commission and on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii Atty. Gen. Warren Price III sent a three-page letter to FCC Chairman 
Dennis R. Patrick urging the commission to deny Paramount's request to transfer 
shares of Time to a voting trust until the agency approves transfer of licenses 
related to Time's cable television business. 
</P>
<P>
Price said Hawaii law requires action by its public utility commission before 
any cable franchises can be transferred, and he urged the FCC not to "abrogate" 
the state's powers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two Democratic senators said they were concerned that the battle 
over Time would result in greater media concentration. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum 
(D-Ohio) reiterated his earlier opposition to the Time-Warner deal and 
expressed similar feeling about Paramount's bid. 
</P>
<P>
Such combinations raise "the threat of less diversity and higher prices to end 
users -- book and magazine readers, moviegoers and cable subscribers," 
Metzenbaum told the Senate Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scouting for Murdoch 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) asked whether "the national good is somehow served" 
by a takeover battle whose outcome may hinge on who has the most cash. 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, the price of Time shares fell $4.875 to $175.125. A day 
earlier, Time's shares had climbed $5 on rumors that another bid might 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an investment banking firm said it was retained last week by media 
baron Rupert Murdoch to analyze the battle for Time. "Something's going to 
happen, and it's going to create opportunity," said Robert Pirie, chairman and 
chief executive of Rothschild Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, the controlling shareholder of News Corp. and its 20th Century Fox 
Film studio, threatened a takeover bid for Warner in 1984 but sold back his 
Warner shares for a profit in a practice regarded as "greenmail." As part of 
the settlement, Murdoch agreed not to acquire Warner stock for 10 years, a 
Warner spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts continued to speculate Wednesday about the options 
available to the Time board. The company might offer to buy Warner, or it might 
recapitalize and pay a large dividend to Time shareholders to placate those who 
want some cash payment, now that the Paramount offer is on the table. The 
merger with Warner might be abandoned altogether, some said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Sell Assets 
</P>
<P>
Each option seems to have a serious flaw that imperils the independence of the 
companies involved, several analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another possibility is a sale of all Time assets. Under federal tax law, a 
formal liquidation would spare the company the hefty capital gains tax on the 
partial sale of assets that might occur if it is acquired by a debt-laden 
company, said Emanuel Gerard, a principal of the New York research firm of 
Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"A formal liquidation is a high-class form of scorched earth. It may be spite, 
but it is profitable spite," said Gerard, who left Warner's office of the 
president in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Time board crosses the bridge that it can no longer be an independent 
company, that would probably be a way to maximize shareholder value," Gerard 
said. "Were that to happen, I believe it would be a seminal event in American 
business, and there would be fallout in Washington."

Braniff Inc.: The Orlando, Fla., airline posted a first-quarter loss of $21.2 
million, compared to an $8.1-million loss a year ago. Revenues were up 49% to 
$139.9 million. The company attributed the loss to high operating costs of the 
BAC 1-11 aircraft, normal seasonality, the costs of expanding service to 
formerly unserved areas and other expenses related to expansion.

SAATCHI CONSIDERS SPINOFF OF ITS CONSULTING BUSINESS

Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., the world's largest advertising firm, said Wednesday 
that it is considering selling or spinning off its consulting unit, possibly 
signaling its departure from a business it entered with high hopes five years 
ago. The announcement came on the heels of a sharp drop in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the company said it had appointed a U.S. investment bank, the 
Blackstone Group, to develop proposals to float stock or sell the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Saatchi entered the consultancy business in 1984 and last year said the 
division was the world's 10th largest in that business. 
</P>
<P>
But the advertising group was said to be increasingly disappointed with the 
consulting unit's results, and its sale has been rumored. 
</P>
<P>
"Recently, the company has received a number of unsolicited approaches 
concerning the consulting unit, as well as interesting proposals concerning a 
flotation of the business as a separate listed company," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's financial results, released Wednesday, showed a sharp drop in 
earnings as pretax profit after exceptional items plunged to $30.7 million 
(20.2 million British pounds) in the six months ended March 31 from $95.9 
million (63.1 million pounds) a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The consulting unit's sales were up 37% to $180.1 million (118.5 million 
pounds). But operating profit declined 12.5% to $11.7 million (7.7 million 
pounds). 
</P>
<P>
"Although the good growth prospects in the consulting industry have been 
confirmed by the increased revenues this year, we believe it is inappropriate 
under market conditions to maintain our aim for world leadership in this 
sector," Saatchi said.

Collins Foods International: Net income for the year ended April 30 rose 13% to 
$28.5 million. Revenue dropped to $541.7 million from $566.5 million. Officials 
of the Los Angeles restaurant operator and franchiser said its Sizzler and 
International divisions contributed to the improved performance, although its 
domestic Kentucky Fried Chicken division was hurt somewhat by increased chicken 
prices and a higher minimum wage in California and Washington state.

BUSINESS SALES RISE 1.7%, OUTPACE INVENTORY GAIN

<P>
Business sales rose 1.7% in April, making their steepest gain since March, 
1988, and far outpacing a 0.6% jump in inventories, the government said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect sales to soften but say they see no sign of any dangerous 
buildup in stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
"We find very little evidence of any excess stocks, and I think that's good 
news for the economy because it lessens the risk of recession as we move 
forward," said economist Lawrence Chimerine of the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Rising inventories, if not accompanied by increased sales, could threaten a 
recession by prompting manufacturers to cut back production until excess stocks 
are sold. 
</P>
<P>
But the ratio of inventories to sales dropped in April to 1.49, meaning that it 
would take 1.49 months to exhaust inventories at the April sales pace. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Chimerine nor Bruce Steinberg, senior economist for Merrill Lynch, 
considers that a troublesome level. 
</P>
<P>
"So far in this business cycle, inventory behavior has been encouraging in that 
it has not become excessive," Steinberg said. "Whether that continues to be the 
case remains to be seen but, at least at this point, there really aren't any 
serious areas of excess." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that sales rose to a seasonally adjusted 
$516.3 billion in April after holding steady in March. The gain was the 
steepest since sales rose 1.8% in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Inventories on shelves and backlots climbed to a seasonally adjusted $769.8 
billion after a 0.3% rise a month earlier, the department said. That was the 
highest since a 0.8% gain in January. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said much of the sales gain was price-related and added, "I wouldn't 
read too much into the sales number."

DREXEL PROBE MAY REVEAL EVEN MORE, SHAD SAYS

<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Chairman John S. R. Shad said Wednesday that the 
federal investigation of insider trading "may well uncover additional 
infractions" at the Wall Street investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
But Shad, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he 
believes that "the bulk of the problems are behind the firm." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel agreed at the end of last year to plead guilty to six felony counts of 
mail, wire and securities fraud and to pay fines of $650 million in the 
government's massive probe of insider trading on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Shad, who spoke at the firm's semiannual economic briefing for journalists, did 
not describe the possible additional infractions. But he said Drexel is aiding 
the Justice Department and the SEC in their investigations. 
</P>
<P>
He said Drexel had hired new legal and compliance experts and said the firm's 
board of directors and key executives "are committed to the highest standards" 
of conduct in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Shad also said Drexel has formed a high-level oversight committee including 
himself, former SEC Chairman Roderick Hills and Ralph Saul, a veteran 
securities executive. Shad was elected chairman of the parent company in April, 
the same time that Hills and Saul joined its board. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's investment banking, merchant banking and high-yield bond activities 
remain healthy, Shad said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the operations that Drexel shed recently, including its retail 
brokerage arm, had been unprofitable. "The dispositions tended to improve 
operating profits," Shad said. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel rose to prominence during the last decade through the huge profitability 
of its high-yield "junk bond" department, formerly led by Michael Milken, who 
himself faces a 98-count indictment charging him with securities fraud and 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's settlement of criminal charges, which excluded Milken, is contingent 
on its settling related civil charges with the SEC. Drexel Chief Executive 
Frederick Joseph said final approval of the firm's settlement with the SEC may 
take several months but added that a challenge by lawyers for Michael Milken 
may delay it further. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who was placed on leave from the firm earlier this year after he was 
indicted, has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is expected to go on trial 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said that although the civil settlement has not been approved by the 
U.S. District Court in New York, the firm is acting as if its provisions are in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"The major impact is behind us," Joseph said, referring to the investigation 
and the proposed settlement. He said the firm has had few if any defections 
among clients.

JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. FALLS 19% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with the United States narrowed 19% last month to $2.76 
billion from a revised $3.4 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first year-to-year decline in four months and is expected to come as 
welcome news in both Washington and Tokyo, where trade tensions have been 
flaring again. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two countries ended two days of trade talks in Japan on 
Wednesday and reportedly agreed to cooperate in reducing the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a rise in imports by Japan helped reduce that nation's overall 
trade surplus to $3.78 billion, down 27% from a year earlier and 48% from the 
previous month, the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Japan's trade surplus showed a rise of 7.7% from the previous year to 
$7.30 billion. In May, 1988, it was $5.19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said May's unadjusted surplus was smaller than expected as 
imports grew despite the relative weakness of the Japanese yen against the 
dollar during the month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Drop From April 
</P>
<P>
However, that weakness in the yen also tended to make the surplus look smaller 
when expressed in dollars, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese exports in May rose 4.9% from the previous year to $21.67 billion, 
while imports climbed 15.7% to $17.89 billion. 
</P>
<P>
After seasonal adjustment, the May surplus came to $3.61 billion, down sharply 
from $6.74 billion in April. 
</P>
<P>
May exports were calculated using an average exchange rate for the month of 
133.98 yen to the dollar, compared to 124.75 yen in May, 1988. Imports were 
calculated at an average rate of 133.78 yen, compared to 124.76 yen a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
A Finance Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
continuing strong domestic demand spurred by Japan's healthy economy 
contributed to the rise in imports. But he said import figures also were 
boosted by world oil prices, which he said averaged $18 a barrel in May, 
compared to $16.20 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of manufactured products among Japan's total imports fell to 
48.6%, the lowest level this year, the official said. The level had been 
increasing in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States rose 3.2% from a year earlier to $7.13 billion, 
while imports from the United States surged 24.6% to $4.37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Imports of general food products from the United States rose 23.4% to $970.4 
million, while Japan's purchases of U.S. chemical products rose 46% to $538.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Imports of general U.S. machinery products, including semiconductors and cars, 
rose 23.3% to $1.18 billion. Within this category, Japanese imports of 
U.S.-made motor vehicles surged 148% to $53.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese exports to the United States of general electrical machinery, 
including videotape recorders, video cameras and semiconductors, rose 11.9% to 
$1.62 billion. But within this category, exports of television cameras fell 
16.7% to $127.6 million.

Exactly where does the San Fernando Valley begin and end? 
</P>
<P>
Most people agree that the Valley starts at Mulholland Drive and continues 
north to the Santa Susana Mountains. But its eastern and western borders are 
not so well-defined. 
</P>
<P>
Even a planner at the Los Angeles Planning Department's Valley office didn't 
have a concrete answer. "We only look at the city of Los Angeles portions, 
which wouldn't include Burbank, Glendale or San Fernando," David Silverman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Auto Club map of the Valley goes as far west as Hidden 
Hills and Calabasas. Yet the Pacific Bell Yellow Pages labeled San Fernando 
Valley West has a map on its back cover that goes farther west, extending to 
Agoura and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if Agoura was part of the Valley, Jo Estes, office manager of the 
Agoura Chamber of Commerce, replied: "Absolutely not. We're in the Conejo 
Valley, which runs up to Calabasas." 
</P>
<P>
On the eastern side, general opinion has it that the border hovers somewhere 
around Burbank. Perhaps Bill Kelly, Burbank's director of community 
development, sums it up best. "I consider Burbank to be more or less the far 
end of the San Fernando Valley."

With the comeback of the martini, could hors d'oeuvres be far behind? Genuine 
hors d'oeuvres, that is. Forget about snacks like tortilla chips and salsa, or 
cut-up carrots fanned around a bowl of "this fabulous yogurt dip." This summer, 
the word is variety. 
</P>
<P>
"They're becoming very popular," notes Steve Roysner, operations manager of 
Parties at Your Door in Woodland Hills. "We serve a real big variety of hors 
d'oeuvres -- maybe 15 or 16 kinds. The food encompasses all kinds of 
nationalities, such as Mexican, Chinese, Italian, continental, Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
A small sampling would include taquitos and quesadillas, egg rolls and teriyaki 
bits, gourmet pizzas, potato pancakes and knishes. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Creative Catering Crew in Canoga Park confirms the trend and 
says party-goers frequently eat more at an hors d'oeuvres bash than at a more 
traditional party because they want to sample everything. 
</P>
<P>
And this classic cocktail-party fare is served at the dinner hour -- at 8 p.m., 
rather than 5 or 6 p.m. Party givers can serve elaborate food but are spared 
the elaborations of serving a buffet dinner.

Wigged Out 
</P>
<P>
Working women are discovering that wigs are one solution to that occasional 
early-morning dilemma: Your hair looks bad and your clock looks worse. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of career women like putting a wig on and being ready to go," says Julie 
Kim, manager of The Wig Co. in North Hollywood. "Wigs are definitely back in 
fashion. Women buy one that's similar to their own color and style. They're 
great for traveling." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the wig's comeback is no mystery. "They're so light now, and the 
quality is much better. You don't have to take them to the beauty parlor like 
you used to," says Daniel Hafid, vice president of Rene of Paris, a Van Nuys 
wig manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Younger women are fans of the banana-clip hairpiece, in which a length of hair 
-- with more volume than a simple pony tail -- is attached to a banana clip, 
Hafid says. "You slick your hair back away from your face and put on the banana 
clip," he says. "They're like jewelry for your hair." 
</P>
<P>
And those wigs with moderate price tags -- $39 to $89 apiece -- have almost 
become an economical alternative to haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Junior Brat Pack 
</P>
<P>
Your own toddler is perfect, of course, but do you sometimes feel that a lot of 
other little kids these days are brats? 
</P>
<P>
"We've noticed an increase in this phenomena of the brat," says Dr. Norman 
Lavin, who teaches pediatric endocrinology at UCLA and shares a pediatric 
practice in Tarzana with his brother Sheldon. "By brat, I mean a kid who whines 
a lot, behaves inappropriately and tries to control the parent." 
</P>
<P>
Lavin figures that there are four reasons why children may end up becoming 
brats. 
</P>
<P>
"First, the parents were brats. Brat parents beget brat kids," he says. 
"Second, some brats are being raised by very sensitive parents. The parents try 
to transmit these feelings to their kids, but they need to be more 
authoritative sometimes. Kids get insecure if they think adults don't have 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
The third cause is parents who want their kids to be overachievers. "They 
enroll them in three or four activities and it's too much for the kid," Lavin 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, two-career couples may feel guilty about leaving their children every 
day. "They don't want their only exposure to the kid to be disciplinary, so 
they give the kid a lot of choices. What they're really doing, though, is 
asking the kid to make decisions like an adult, and the kid isn't ready to do 
that yet. 
</P>
<P>
"If a tantrum works, they'll up the ante next time," Lavin notes. "Don't reward 
negative behavior. The sooner you catch it, the easier it is to reverse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overheard at . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I look at this painting and I think to myself, 'Picasso kissed with his eyes 
open.' This is what a woman's face looks like when you're up that close."

FORMER CITY MANAGER WILL RETURN TO POST IN LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new city manager of La Canada Flintridge is familiar with the issues of the 
rustic rural community and the furniture in the office he takes over today. 
</P>
<P>
George Caswell has been there before. 
</P>
<P>
He was city manager from 1980 to 1983, preceding Donald H. Otterman, who 
stepped down Wednesday to take a similar job in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had announced that they would seek an interim manager after 
Otterman, 42, announced May 16 that he was leaving. But now no one is certain 
whether Caswell should be considered temporary or permanent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stay Lengthened 
</P>
<P>
"The last time, I went for a three-month contract and spent three years," said 
Caswell, 69. "This time, we're discussing a one-year contract. But, based on 
past experience, who knows how long I'll stay?" 
</P>
<P>
Caswell will be working only part time, but Councilwoman Joan Feehan said she 
has "a real good feeling that he is going to stay. When you are a small 
contract city, there is not that much going on" to require a full-time manager. 
</P>
<P>
Caswell declined to discuss contract negotiations. However, he said the terms 
are similar to previous contracts that he has held with the city. The terms 
will not be made final by the City Council until July. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper accounts reported that Caswell was given a one-year, $36,000 contract 
when he was hired as the permanent, part-time manager in 1981. The contract 
included an expense account and 36 paid vacation and leave days but no other 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Caswell said he still intends to work only three days a week, unlike Otterman, 
who earned $61,200 a year in the full-time post that he held for five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Part-Time Job 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't want to be a full-time city manager," said Caswell, who retired 
in 1980 after 18 years as manager of the city of La Verne, where he and his 
wife still live. "I don't want to go to work for eight hours a day, five days a 
week," although he said he is not adverse to the 30-mile, 40-minute commute. 
</P>
<P>
Caswell called his return to La Canada Flintridge "a natural kind of thing. I 
think I sense the goals of the community rather than just going in absolutely 
cold." He said he plans to meet individually with council members to discuss 
their priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Caswell has been a pinch-hitter in municipal government since he retired. He 
did two stints with the city of Fontana, as an interim city manager for about 
seven months in 1987, then as an interim director of public works for nine 
months last year. He just completed his duties as manager of Diamond Bar before 
its successful cityhood formation drive. 
</P>
<P>
As far as his commitment to La Canada Flintridge, Caswell said he agreed to 
take over stewardship of the city "just on a handshake." The details are to be 
worked out later.

SENIORS BRACE FOR ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County all-star football game should develop into a contrast of 
styles Saturday night at 7:30 at Oxnard High. 
</P>
<P>
The West team intends to grind it out with powerful running backs Freddie 
Bradley of Hueneme, Tim Albrendt of Ventura, Paul Rezac of St. Bonaventure and 
John Johnson of Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
The East will air it out with tall, strong-armed quarterbacks Wayne Cook of 
Newbury Park and Rick Carpenter of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight of the county's top seniors will participate. Hueneme's George 
Machado will coach the West and Camarillo's Carl Thompson will coach the East. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Johnson each rushed for more than 1,000 yards last season. Cook 
signed a letter of intent to play quarterback at UCLA and Carpenter passed for 
more than 2,000 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our backs look super because they are running behind outstanding linemen," 
Machado said. 
</P>
<P>
Top West linemen include JR Perez and Jim Caballero of Santa Clara, Jose 
Montelongo of Channel Islands and Matt Biesecker of Buena. Should Machado 
decide to pass, his quarterbacks can choose from a fine group of receivers, 
including Santa Clara's Matt Young, Buena's Jim Collins and Ventura's Chris 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Cook and Carpenter's targets will include James Jones of Royal and Matt 
Wollcott of Westlake. Among those providing protection will be tackle Rick 
McCathron of Thousand Oaks.

MARINE CHARGED IN 2 KILLINGS, ROBBERY AT COIN DEALERSHIP 
</P>

A 20-year-old Tustin Marine was charged Wednesday with the murder of two people 
at a Newport Beach rare coin dealership in an execution-style assault and 
robbery in March that also left the firm's owner critically wounded, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Cpl. Eric Jon Wick was being held without bail Wednesday at the Newport 
Beach Jail in connection with the murders of Clyde Oatts and Renee Ratoon King, 
and the wounding of her husband, the owner of Newport Beach Coin Exchange, 
Newport Beach police said. 
</P>
<P>
Wick, stationed at the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Station, is the son of an 
FBI agent based in Reno, Nev., and his fingerprints allegedly were found at the 
crime scene, military sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine, who had been held by military authorities after being arrested last 
week in Reno, was taken into custody by Newport Beach police Wednesday on a 
warrant charging him with two counts of homicide, one count of attempted 
homicide, one count of robbery and one count of burglary, Newport Beach Police 
Lt. Tim Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
William D. King, 37, owner of the coin firm, could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday on the arrest in the slaying of his 38-year-old wife and his friend, 
Oatts, 45. Riley said King, who suffered gunshot wounds to the head and chest, 
is recovering at home. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the murder and robbery, King, a precious metals trader, was 
under investigation for allegedly bilking dozens of investors out of $1 million 
through a Newport Beach telemarketing company, Precious Metals Accumulation 
Corp., or Premaco, which sold contracts for gold, platinum and silver. 
</P>
<P>
Oatts was a commodities broker at Monex International of Newport Beach. His 
wife, reached at her Irvine home late Wednesday, said she was glad to hear of 
the arrest in the case. "I think if that's who it was (responsible for the 
crimes), then it's good." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach police spokesman Lt. Tim Newman said detectives worked closely 
with the Naval Investigative Service to make the arrest in the case. Military 
sources said investigators linked Wick to the scene of the crime by 
fingerprints on a display case at the exchange house. 
</P>
<P>
As the investigation proceeded, Newman said Wick "fled the area and went absent 
without leave." Investigators suspected that he had gone to his hometown, Reno, 
and notified police there. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said Reno police set up a surveillance at Wick's "last known address" in 
Reno, "and he was arrested by them on the evening of June 8 without incident." 
</P>
<P>
The Naval Investigative Service took custody of Wick and eventually transferred 
him to the brig at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until Wednesday that Newport Beach detectives, working with the 
Orange County district attorney's office, obtained the arrest warrant for Wick, 
charging him with the murders. Newman said an investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Wick, who has been on active duty since May 4, 1988, was a small arms repairman 
in the Marine Corps, according to Master Sgt. Steve Merrill, public affairs 
chief at the El Toro base. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an armorer. He would fix rifles and pistols, and was in charge of 
issuance and custody of weapons," Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
Wick was a member of Marine Aircraft Group 16, said Lt. Gene Browne, also a 
public affairs officer at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
While military sources said Wick is the son of an FBI agent, no one was 
available at the Reno FBI office late Wednesday to confirm that relationship. 
In the Las Vegas office, an officer in charge confirmed that an agent named 
Bruce Wick works in the Reno office, but Bruce Wick could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on King, his wife and Oatts occurred March 14 at the Newport Coin 
Exchange offices on MacArthur Boulevard. Sources close to the investigation 
have said that all three were shot in the back or top of the head "execution 
style." A shotgun was recovered at the scene, and the area was littered with 
9-millimeter ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics rushed King to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center 
after they ignored his pleas to let him die at the scene, the federal source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, police said they believed that robbery was a motive in the 
slayings but were not ruling out other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the investigation said in March that King and his attorney 
had been negotiating with federal authorities concerning indictments on the 
various mail and wire fraud charges in the Premaco case. 
</P>
<P>
According to affidavits filed by postal investigators, Premaco salesmen hawked 
their wares to the public through telephone solicitations, promotional 
mailings, TV ads on Financial News Network and newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in connection with those investigations could not be reached for 
comment Wednesday.

<P>
The snapshots of America are as simple as they are familiar: a mirrored 
skyscraper standing tall over a sleepy city, a shoe store on a busy street, a 
swimming pool and hot tub nestled behind a tract house. 
</P>
<P>
Each is but a snippet of a vast and complex nation, but taken together a 
picture begins to emerge of a people and a country, one seemingly so rich in 
many ways yet so needy in others. 
</P>
<P>
It was the America as seen through the eyes of Maxim V. Chikin and Aleksie 
Grinevich, two Soviet journalists who gained firsthand impressions of life in 
the United States while accompanying 11-year-old Tony Aliengena of San Juan 
Capistrano on his historic flight around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Chikin and Grinevich are following Tony as an expression of the 
Soviet Union's interest and good-will in the youngster's "Friendship Flight" 
that will reach its emotional peak with a stop in Moscow and a possible meeting 
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
But for the 27-year-old Soviet journalists, the trip also has been a rare 
opportunity to take a close look at a country that has been both feared and 
admired in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Since Tony's seven-week odyssey in a private plane began June 5, the 
correspondents -- both from Moscow -- have been reporting back to their readers 
on everything from the presence of swimming pools and tennis courts atop 
high-rise buildings in Denver to $750-a-night hotel rooms at ski resorts above 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
"You will understand when we are in the Soviet Union why I am so excited about 
this," Chikin, a correspondent for the Soviet youth newspaper Komsomolskaya 
Pravda (circulation 18 million), said as he eagerly snapped photographs in 
downtown Denver. "At home, there are no goods." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Tony is being allowed to fly across the Soviet Union later in his 
trip is due in large measure to the Soviets' desire to try to better understand 
what Chikin describes as "the middle American." 
</P>
<P>
They see as one such average American Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, a former 
truck driver who now invests in real estate and owns a plane, three cars, and 
large house with swimming pool and hot tub. Chikin said that his first dispatch 
from America was about the rags-to-riches story of Aliengena, 39. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the American dream," Chikin said of Aliengena's successes in both the 
real estate market and a truck-transportation company. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet journalists were so taken with observing the lives of "average" 
Americans during the week that they ignored practically everything else. On 
tours of Salt Lake City and Denver, for example, they asked their guides to 
show them where middle Americans lived and worked. 
</P>
<P>
When Denver tour guide B.J. Eckardt, a local magazine publisher, asked if they 
wanted to see the poorer side of town to counter-balance the opulence they had 
seen earlier, both replied "nyet." And when they passed a beggar on the street, 
Chikin dismissed the sight. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we've seen one of those already," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Chikin nor Grinevich, a correspondent for the newspaper Sovetskaya 
Kultura (circulation 3 million), had been to the United States before. 
</P>
<P>
In their travels through Orange County, Salt Lake City, Denver and Boston, both 
expressed unabashed admiration of America's wealth and technology and added 
they hoped that their government would emulate its system of free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Under socialism, we have no (successful economic) models to follow," Chikin 
said. "So we have to look outside for models to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, by contrast, Chikin said, goods are so scarce that even 
he, a success by Moscow standards by virtue of a prestigious job and an 
apartment in Moscow, cannot obtain some essential goods. 
</P>
<P>
"My poor wife tells me when I get home (from work) that she had gone to the 
shops (for food) and found nothing," said Chikin, who cannot afford a car but 
is saving frugally to buy one. 
</P>
<P>
This unabashed praise of the United States stands in contrast to the 
America-bashing that was so common in the Soviet press only five years ago. 
Under Gorbachev's new policy of glasnost, or openness, Chikin and Grinevich 
said they are encouraged to report the truth about the United States. And 
during this trip with Tony, they are trying to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the Soviet press reported that America was poor and that the 
majority of people were homeless and with nothing to eat," Chikin said. "But it 
is not true. America is a rich and wealthy country and now it's time to say the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
On their tour last week of Salt Lake City and vicinity, the Soviets' eyes 
bulged as tour guide Deanna Winn pointed out such attractions as a ski resort 
condominium which recently sold for $1 million and a three-story hilltop 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it for one family?" Chikin asked in disbelief about the mansion, which 
housed one not-so-average American family. 
</P>
<P>
Yet life in the United States has not all been vodka and caviar for the 
Muscovites. Arriving in Orange County from Moscow 10 days ago, they have had to 
overcome severe jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
They also have had to adjust to the somewhat unsettling experience of flying in 
a private plane. The two Soviets, along with this reporter, are riding in a 
twin-engine chase plane that is accompanying Tony's single-engine Cessna. The 
plane, delayed in Washington with mechanical problems, picked them up in Boston 
Wednesday and caught up with the entourage in Iqaluit in the Northwest 
Territories. 
</P>
<P>
The food here is, likewise, less than thrilling for the Soviets. At a Mexican 
restaurant near Salt Lake City, the two grimaced and shook their heads when 
asked if they wanted to sample guacamole and salsa. Chikin explained that they 
are accustomed to a bland diet and could not stomach the hot spices of Mexican 
food. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets wound up munching on some cheese quesadillas, the only non-spicy 
item on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Chikin also found disturbing the Americans' preoccupation against cigarette 
smoking. An avid smoker like many of his countrymen, Chikin said he feels like 
an outcast lighting up in a country where smoking is banned in many public 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody watches me like I am an Eskimo when I smoke," Chikin said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, the Soviets say they have been impressed by the friendliness 
of most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in England last year and I thought the United States would be like 
there, where the people are not friendly," Chikin said. "But here, the people 
laugh a lot and are very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their American counterpart, the Soviet journalists took no notes to 
record their observations, whether good and bad. Instead, they spend a few 
moments before turning in at night to jot down their thoughts in a journal. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't take notes every day because we don't need all the small facts that 
you are taking down," Chikin explained. "We need only our impressions." 
</P>
<P>
Grinevich said that his most important story would come at the conclusion of 
Tony's flight, scheduled for July 20 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
What the Soviets did have in common with American reporters, however, was a 
tendency to work erratic hours and a dread of what an editor might do to a 
story. Chikin, for instance, had worried that his Tuesday dispatch might have 
been bumped from his newspaper altogether because of the international news 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Both Chikin and Grinevich have been professional journalists for about five 
years, having completed training in Moscow universities and served the 
requisite two years in the Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
After covering local stories around Moscow, the two journalists began going out 
on foreign assignments, a coveted job both in American and Soviet newsrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Chikin has been dispatched to France, Czechoslovakia and India, while Grinevich 
has been to Europe and Southeast Asia. Chikin is multilingual, fluent in 
English, French and Czech, besides his native Russian. Grinevich speaks much 
less English, and in America has relied upon Chikin to interpret. 
</P>
<P>
In their travels, they bring with them only a small bag of clothing and 
essentials and a log book to record impressions and write stories. Then they 
dictate their stories to editors back in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Although they were favorably impressed with the United States and rail 
incessantly about the economic troubles back home, neither said he would ever 
want to move. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the motherland," Chikin said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean they won't want to come back for a visit. Last week, as 
Grinevich drank in the pure mountain air of a Utah ski resort, he suddenly 
pulled a coin from his pocket and sent it sailing into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a Soviet custom," he explained. "If we threw the coin, it means we must 
return to this place."

$250,000 IN DRUG-FIGHTING MONEY SPENT ON BUSH'S VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Sheriff's Department revealed Wednesday that it spent about $250,000 from 
its drug-fighting budget to prepare a remote canyon ranch for an Orange County 
visit by President Bush in April. 
</P>
<P>
The expense was immediately criticized by a county Democratic figure who said 
it was inappropriate to spend money intended for drug investigations on a "dog 
and pony show" for the President. 
</P>
<P>
"Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars could go a long way to build more drug 
rehabilitation centers, pay more adequate salaries for our law enforcement 
personnel and help train more officers so we can stop drugs, instead of paying 
for a public relations campaign, which is what that was," said John Hanna, 
former county Democratic chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money was used to turn a rustic backwoods ranch into a 90-minute 
staging area for the President on April 25. Workers graded and spread gravel on 
a 3.5-mile dirt road, added a stage and put in telephone lines, electricity, 
toilets and furniture for a closed-door lunch for Bush and local drug agents. 
</P>
<P>
The money also paid for several buses from the Orange County Transit District 
to carry about 1,400 invited guests to the ranch, near Ortega Highway and 
Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 213-acre site, known as Rancho del Rio, was formerly owned by a notorious 
drug smuggler and was seized in 1985 during an investigation conducted by the 
Sheriff's Department. The county now owns the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters of Bush's visit selected the site as a good setting for his anti-drug 
speech, during which he presented the county and other local law enforcement 
agencies with a $4.39-million check for money seized during a separate county 
drug investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Walter Fath said the $250,000 will be paid from the county's 
share of that check. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1984 federal law, the money seized during a drug investigation must be 
spent on suppression of drugs. Fath said the U.S. attorney's office in Los 
Angeles -- at the county's request -- ruled that the President's anti-drug 
speech constituted a drug education expense and was therefore a proper use of 
the seized money. 
</P>
<P>
Fath, who said he was speaking for Sheriff Brad Gates, said that the cost was 
close to what the department expected when it started the project and that 
Gates "made both the Board of Supervisors and the County Administrative Office 
aware of the visit. They knew it was coming out of the narcotics fund, and 
people knew what we were doing up there." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, was unavailable late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Larry Parrish said that he was unaware of the 
exact cost of the President's visit but that he was "generally aware." 
</P>
<P>
He said Gates met with Riley before he proceeded with the improvements at the 
ranch, and "that's fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
Fath also said that with the improvements, it is now possible to use the ranch 
as a training facility and conference center for law enforcement agencies. That 
is the purpose Gates has suggested to the Board of Supervisors for the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
But officially, the future of the ranch remains under study. Privately, some 
county officials would rather see a different use. It has been suggested that 
the ranch be sold to gain more money for the Sheriff's Department or even that 
the site be used for a remote jail. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish predicted Wednesday, however, that Gates is now more likely to get his 
wish for a training center, because the improvements needed for that purpose 
have already taken place. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fortuitous (for Gates) that the President of the United States showed 
up," Parrish said. "Certainly, activities (improvements) were possible in that 
scenario that would have been far more difficult. So when you've got all the 
(political) talent in the world and all the luck in the world, you're in pretty 
good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Fath said the $250,000 estimate does not include several thousand dollars in 
goods and services donated to prepare for the President's visit. The food for 
the invited guests and the President's lunch were donated, as well as $8,000 in 
flowers and the landscaping crews to plant them.

DRUG-ADDICTED BABIES TAX SYSTEM, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are not enough senior social workers or foster homes to care for babies 
born with drug dependencies in Orange County, according to a grand jury report 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report said there were 202 drug-exposed babies born in Orange County from 
July, 1988, through April, 1989. Because there are not enough foster homes, 
some babies are unnecessarily kept in hospitals at a significantly higher cost 
to the government. 
</P>
<P>
The cost for a hospital to accommodate a drug dependent baby is up to $7,500 
per month. In a foster home, the cost ranges from $559 to $867 per month, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the grand jury recommended that the Social Services Agency 
"actively pursue a recruitment program for additional foster families" and that 
it try to hire more senior social workers. 
</P>
<P>
The report also recommended that the county explore the possibility of 
developing special homes where drug dependent babies can remain with their 
birth mothers while they are in drug treatment programs, as other counties have 
done.

AIDS ACTIVISTS FEAR ORDINANCE'S DEFEAT MAY INCREASE BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH and DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

<P>
AIDS activists were outraged Wednesday over the rejection of an 
anti-discrimination ordinance by the Orange County Board of Supervisors and 
expressed concern that landlords and employers may now think they can 
discriminate against people carrying the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that, unfortunately, it sends the wrong message to people in Orange 
County -- that it might even be OK to discriminate against people with HIV 
(human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS)," said John Duran, an Anaheim 
attorney active in the gay community. "I won't be surprised to see an increase 
in HIV discrimination because of this vote." 
</P>
<P>
Defeat of the ordinance may also discourage people with AIDS from being tested 
or getting medical help, AIDS experts and gay community leaders said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"People will die because the supervisors rejected this ordinance," said Werner 
Kuhn, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center of 
Orange County. "People will be afraid to go in and get tested and will continue 
to be afraid to get care. Those are very real fears because the discrimination 
is very real." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors on Tuesday voted 3 to 2 against a proposed ordinance that would 
prohibit discrimination in housing, employment and county services against 
people carrying the virus for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The measure 
would have applied only to the unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the ordinance said its passage would have strengthened federal 
and state laws that already forbid discrimination against people who have AIDS 
or the HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid this sends the wrong message to the average citizen in Orange 
County that discrimination against people who have AIDS-related illnesses is 
OK," said Dr. Don Hagan, a member of the county's HIV advisory committee. "That 
is the one thing we wanted to prevent the most. I don't think we ever would 
have brought this to the board if we thought it would have failed." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's gay and lesbian community blamed a campaign by a vocal lobby of 
conservative Christians and statements by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton) for turning the supervisors' discussion of the ordinance into an 
attack on the gay life style. 
</P>
<P>
"In Orange County, we have one of the most vocal fundamentalist groups, and 
they're very loud," said Dr. Drew Barras, co-chairman of ECCO, the Election 
Committee of the County of Orange, a political action committee that supports 
gay rights issues. "Dannemeyer's statements at that meeting had nothing to do 
with health. His statements had absolutely everything to do with gay bashing," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer and representatives of the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's Anaheim-based 
Traditional Values Coalition attended the supervisors' meeting Tuesday to voice 
their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"The community is just in an uproar," said Jeff LeTourneau, co-chair of the 
Orange County Visibility League, a gay and lesbian activist group. "There's 
been an outpouring of anger." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said the center in Garden Grove has received many calls from people 
outraged about the supervisors' vote. "And not just from gay people. Gay and 
straight people alike wonder, 'How can they do this?"' he said. 
</P>
<P>
As of April 30, 1,049 people in Orange County have contracted AIDS, according 
to the county's HIV Advisory Committee. Of that number, 614 have died. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say there are several laws that now protect people with AIDS or the HIV 
infection from discrimination, but activists complain they are sometimes 
inadequate and that the complaint process takes so long that the people 
alleging discrimination often die before their case is heard. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against 
handicapped individuals by federal agencies, federal contractors and their 
suppliers. Two years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that people with 
communicable diseases are protected by that law. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals went a step further the same year to define AIDS specifically as a 
handicap in a case involving Irvine teacher Vincent Chalk. 
</P>
<P>
California's Fair Employment and Housing Act essentially extends the same 
protection to all employees with a few exceptions -- notably, those working for 
nonprofit corporations and religious associations. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists said the problem with that act is that a complainant must get 
permission from the state before filing a civil lawsuit seeking damages, a 
process that can take up to five months. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people die before they ever find out whether they have the right to sue," 
Duran said. "Others (who have lost jobs) have health benefits put into 
jeopardy" during the waiting process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County ordinance would have allowed alleged victims of AIDS 
discrimination to sue immediately, as do at least some of the similar measures 
passed in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Riverside and Alameda 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
The courts have classified AIDS as a handicap but have yet to decide whether 
someone carrying the HIV virus -- but who doesn't have AIDS -- would be granted 
the same protection as someone with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinances in Los Angeles County and other areas also guarantee that employers 
and landlords may not discriminate against those who have the HIV infection but 
do not have symptoms of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for several Orange County employers said that they do not have 
written policies regarding the treatment of employees with AIDS but that all 
such employees are treated fairly. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not consider a positive AIDS test to be reason for any type of 
restriction on the work of that employee," said Scott Rayburn, a spokesman for 
Hughes Aircraft Co. in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"The presence or absence of an AIDS anti-discrimination ordinance would have no 
impact whatsoever on how we act," said Richard Foster, president of Interstate 
Electronics in Anaheim. "We treat this with compassion and privacy."

TRUCKER GETS A YEAR IN JAIL FOR FATAL CRASH ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A Fresno trucker who pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter in the deaths 
of three people on the Santa Ana Freeway last year was sentenced Monday to a 
year in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Wayne Dillard, 56, was driving a tractor-trailer rig when he plowed into 
slowed traffic just south of the interchange with the Garden Grove Freeway in 
Santa Ana on April 23, 1988, touching off a chain-reaction collision involving 
11 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the three people who were killed, 10 others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Though Dillard was initially booked on suspicion of three counts of vehicular 
manslaughter and felony driving under the influence, Deputy Dist. Atty. Maurice 
L. Evans later agreed to allow Dillard to plead no contest to the single count. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said that Dillard had not been drinking or taking drugs and that he was 
extremely remorseful over what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
Though Dillard could have received three years in prison, Superior Court Judge 
Myron S. Brown agreed with state prison and probation authorities, who said a 
prison sentence was too severe for the trucker. 
</P>
<P>
Brown sentenced Dillard instead to two years in prison, but suspended it and 
placed him on probation, with the added provision that he spend a year in the 
county jail system. Dillard is expected to serve his time at one of the branch 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the collision were Antonio R. Lozano, 69; his wife, Maria S. Lozano, 
58, and his brother, Bartolo R. Lozano. The victims' relatives filed suit 
against Dillard and his employer, Cal Pacific Inc. of Fresno.

The decomposing body of a man in his 40s was discovered Wednesday in the 
bedroom of a Santa Ana home by an occupant of the house who called police, 
officers said.

Santa Ana Police Sgt. Jim McDaniel said the body of the unidentified man showed 
signs of "trauma" that indicated a homicide. But he said investigators were

A campground in the Angeles National Forest has been closed to allow health 
officials to control an outbreak of an animal disease that shows up as bubonic 
plague in humans, authorities said Wednesday. A ground squirrel found in the 
Table Mountain Campground about four miles west of Wrightwood has tested 
positive for sylvatic, or animal, plague, Los Angeles County health officials 
said. The disease is a bacterial infection affecting wild animals -- especially 
ground squirrels -- and can be transmitted to humans by means of a flea bite. 
In humans, plague symptoms include enlargement of lymph glands near the bite, 
followed by fever and chills. It can be fatal if left untreated.

INVESTOR ALLEGES NEC SOUGHT TO INFLATE STOCK PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investor in National Education Corp. filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing the 
Irvine-based educational training firm and its chairman of releasing false and 
misleading information about the company's financial prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed by David Grobow, who bought stock in the company on May 30, 
four days after the company said its revenue and earnings would remain flat or 
begin to decline during the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Grobow claimed in the suit that National Education and its chairman, H. David 
Bright, attempted to inflate stock prices until Monday of this week, when it 
released an even more discouraging announcement. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, National Education's stock lost 18.5% of its value, falling $3.625 
per share to close at $16 per share. It closed Wednesday at $17 a share, up 
37.5 cents for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on behalf of investors 
who purchased National Education stock between May 26 and June 12. During the 
period, more than 3 million shares traded hands. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said Grobow purchased 500 shares of stock at $20.375 per share for an 
investment of $10,750. 
</P>
<P>
National Education's general counsel Jeffrey Brill declined to comment on the 
charges. He said the company had not received a copy of the lawsuit. Bright was 
traveling and could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On May 26, National Education announced that its revenue and net income might 
be flat to lower for the three months ending June 30 as compared to the second 
quarter of 1988. The company said that sales at its Applied Learning subsidiary 
had been weak but that its revenue outlook for the entire year remained strong 
and it expected to make up any second quarter shortfall by year-end, the suit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
National Education stock fell $2.375 per share on the day of the announcement 
to close at $21.125 per share. 
</P>
<P>
On June 12, the company announced that disappointing results for May at the 
Applied Learning subsidiary indicated National Education's second quarter 
revenue and earnings might be "substantially lower" than the second quarter of 
last year. It said that since its May release, revenue and expected revenue at 
Applied Learning had failed to meet earlier expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that the company was aware at the time of the May 26 release 
that the Applied Learning subsidiary would have disappointing preliminary 
results but that the May statement was worded in an overly optimistic way in an 
effort to prevent the company's stock price from sliding. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also said that between Jan. 1 and June 12, four current or former 
directors of the company sold a total of 131,000 shares of company stock. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Education's debt securities were placed under review 
Wednesday by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. The credit rating organization said it 
placed $57.5 million of National Education bonds on its "Credit Watch" because 
of weakened cash flow protection and concerns over the diminished earnings 
outlook of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P said that National Education's capital spending has risen sharply to 
fund expansion in recent years and that the company's cash flow has been 
weakened. National Education's total debt increased $48 million in the past 
year and was $122 million on March 31, S&amp;P said.

BANK SEEKS $211,000 PLUS DAMAGES; 
</P>
<P>
CHRISTIAN FARMERS MARKET FACES FRAUD SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Dana Niguel Bank has sued Christian Farmers Market for more than $211,000 plus 
punitive damages, alleging that the upscale grocery chain has defrauded the 
institution and defaulted on a loan. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit gives further indication of financial problems for Christian 
Farmers Market. Over the weekend of May 27, the chain abruptly closed the doors 
of its open-air grocery and food court at MainPlace/Santa Ana mall. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Farmers Markets still operates two stores, in Laguna Hills and San 
Juan Capistrano. The chain earlier had two other stores, in Diamond Bar and 
Fullerton, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The owners and founders of the Orange County grocery chain, Michael and Susan 
Christian, could not be reached for comment. Their attorney also could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit filed April 25 in Superior Court in Santa Ana, the 
Christians borrowed $290,000 from Dana Niguel Bank in May, 1987. The loan "was 
to repurchase all of the business assets" of the Christian Farmers Market in 
Diamond Bar, which had been sold the year before, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
To secure the loan, the Christians gave the bank a security interest in the 
accounts, fixtures, furniture and inventory of the Diamond Bar store. 
</P>
<P>
Within 15 months, by August, 1988, the Christians -- without asking the bank's 
consent -- had transferred their collateral in the Diamond Bar store to their 
landlord in exchange for ending their 15-year lease, the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
The bank agreed to substitute the collateral at the Diamond Bar store for the 
collateral at the Christian Farmers Market in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The Christians later "abandoned the Fullerton store and turned over the key to 
the store to the landlord," the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
The Christians have not made payments on the bank's loan since Feb. 1, the 
action contends. The bank wants to immediately collect more than $211,415 plus 
interest and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to seeking repayment of the loan, the bank has sued the couple for 
fraud. The bank contends that the couple "had no intention of repaying the 
loan" or giving Dana Niguel Bank a security interest in the collateral of the 
Diamond Bar store. 
</P>
<P>
Bank officers declined comment on the suit. The bank's lawyers could not be 
reached for comment.

Westminster Mall's renovation project is in full swing, with the owners 
announcing that Charlotte Russe, the women's apparel retailer, will be the 
anchor tenant in the new center court. 
</P>
<P>
The 11,000-square-foot Charlotte Russe store will be the chain's 14th outlet. 
It will be in a glass, two-story triangular center court, which will also 
include a fountain pool and an elevator in a glass column. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Charlotte Russe store, which will be the chain's flagship, 
is scheduled to begin Aug. 15. Plans call for the store to be finished by 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 shops will occupy the mall's new center court. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Charlotte Russe, other new tenants added as part of the 
face-lift include Sweats &amp; Surf, Kay Bee Toys and San Francisco Music Box. 
The project will also add new food outlets, including DiMattia's Pizza &amp; 
Pasta and the new Panda Express, which features Chinese food. A total of 14 
food outlets eventually will open at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate Property Investors, the mall's owners, began an extensive remodeling 
project at the mall in early February. So far, ceilings have been pulled out, 
asbestos removed, and the old center court torn out. 
</P>
<P>
The project will cost more than $10 million. The renovation is expected to be 
completed by the end of this year.

25 YEARS AGO THIS SUMMER, 3 MURDERS IN MISSISSIPPI SPARKED A REVOLUTION IN 
CIVIL RIGHTS, A FIRE THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES AND ACTIVISTS HOPE TO REKINDLE

<P>
The killings on a dark Mississippi highway took less than five minutes. Now, 25 
years later, the nation is about to relive them. 
</P>
<P>
On a hot and sticky night in 1964, a gang of police and Ku Klux Klansmen 
kidnaped and murdered three civil rights workers after a high-speed chase 
through the backwoods of Neshoba County. They pulled the young men from their 
car and shot them one by one, laughing as the victims hurtled backward into a 
ditch. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next two hours, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney 
were buried in an earthen dam, and it was not until 44 days later that their 
badly decomposed bodies were discovered by FBI agents. Just before he was 
killed, Schwerner reportedly looked his executioner in the eye and said, "Sir, 
I know just how you feel." 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi, June 21, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
The night the three civil rights workers disappeared, the case became a media 
sensation. As federal agents slogged through back-country swamps searching for 
the missing men whose names would become household words, hundreds of 
journalists descended on the scene and the brutality of Southern racism became 
front-page news. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 1,000 white college students from the North began flooding 
into Mississippi to help blacks register to vote and organize politically. They 
were part of the historic "Freedom Summer" program, which black and white 
activists hoped would focus national attention on the evils of segregation. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the tragedy, it was one of our country's finest hours," says Haywood 
Burns, a Mississippi volunteer who is now dean of the CUNY Law School at Queens 
College in New York. "That summer, spurred on by the killings, blacks and 
whites were working together for simple human justice as they never had before 
or since." 
</P>
<P>
It was also a time for Northerners to confront their own racism. How many would 
have voiced outrage if Goodman and Schwerner -- both from Jewish homes -- had 
been black, like Chaney? Before the three murders, blacks had been routinely 
slaughtered in Mississippi, yet there was little outcry when their bodies were 
found hanging from trees or floating in rivers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, prosecutors cracked the case with informers and convicted eight men 
for conspiring to deny the civil rights of Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney. But 
none served more than 10 years, and some of those originally charged -- 
including Lawrence Rainey, the sheriff of Neshoba County -- were acquitted. 
Soon, the story disappeared from the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a new generation of college students seems to know little about the 
case, and Freedom Summer is a distant memory. Although last year's film 
"Mississippi Burning" focused on the period, critics say it grossly ignored the 
leadership -- and courage -- of blacks in fighting Southern racism. Apart from 
Queens College, which has commemorated the deaths with special events this 
year, most campuses are quiet as the anniversary approaches. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the three families and a broad coalition of civil rights groups 
are not about to let the country forget. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since the murders, the families have continued to be active in 
civil rights issues, despite emotional wounds that have yet to fully heal. The 
Goodmans have supported efforts to promote better relations among blacks and 
Jews, Michael Schwerner's widow has become involved in women's issues in her 
law practice and the Chaney family has spoken out on political and economic 
issues affecting blacks. 
</P>
<P>
To mark the 25th anniversary next week, the Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman 
Coalition is sponsoring a bus caravan that will leave Mississippi for the North 
and focus on the need for greater voter registration. The entourage will begin 
on June 21 in Philadelphia, Miss., near the site of the killings, and then make 
stops in Selma, Ala., Washington and finally New York. Hundreds of volunteers 
who were part of Freedom Summer are expected to join the caravan, including 
several busloads from California. 
</P>
<P>
It will be an opportunity to remember, and also to rekindle the idealism that 
led so many men and women to put their bodies on the line in the summer of 
1964. Members of the Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney families find it painful to 
talk about these memories, but believe there are important lessons to be 
learned from that fateful night in Mississippi. Through their eyes, a turning 
point in the history of this country comes alive once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more aware than ever of the need for young people to remember the past, 
to know their history. How can we move them, how can we excite them to care 
about things as deeply as students once did?" -- Carolyn Goodman, mother of 
Andrew Goodman 
</P>
<P>
Freedom Summer was born out of a crisis in the Mississippi civil rights 
movement. By early 1964, less than 5% of the state's 500,000 blacks were 
registered to vote, despite intense grassroots efforts by a coalition of black 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
When blacks tried to register, they frequently were terrorized by the Klan, 
which had ties to law enforcement officers throughout the state. Some blacks 
who spoke out simply disappeared and were never heard from again. Others were 
beaten publicly, their punishment meant as an example to others. Homes and 
churches were firebombed and cross-burnings were common. 
</P>
<P>
Determined not to back down, civil right activists responded with a daring 
plan. In addition to local blacks, hundreds of white college students would be 
invited down to the state to help register more voters. They would come from 
some of the nation's best schools, and through their experiences the nation 
would finally learn the truth about Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
"The white students brought the rest of the country down with them for a look," 
said Robert Moses, a black activist who helped lead the Freedom Summer 
movement. "And we knew that Mississippi couldn't stand a hard look." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Answering the Call 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, activists fanned out across the nation and began seeking 
volunteers. One of those who answered the call was Andrew Goodman, a 
20-year-old student from Queens College. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, a handsome, dark-haired anthropology major, was an ideal recruit. He 
came from a progressive, politically involved family on New York's upper west 
side and had previous experience in the civil rights movement. When he told his 
parents that he wanted to work in Mississippi for the summer, they found it 
hard to say no. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart sank when he told us," says his mother, a psychologist who has long 
been involved in progressive causes. "We knew all about the dangers down there, 
but we had encouraged Andy to care about the world around him. Our whole lives 
would have been a lie if we tried to stop him." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, Goodman departed for a training session in Oxford, Ohio, that was 
required for all Freedom Summer volunteers. On the night of June 20, he phoned 
his parents to report that his first assignment would be to check out the 
burning of a black church near Philadelphia, Miss., that had taken place 
several days before. He would be traveling with Michael Schwerner, 24, a civil 
rights worker who had been in the region for six months, and James Chaney, 21, 
a native of Meridian, Miss., who worked closely with Schwerner. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the last we ever heard from Andy," says his mother, her voice 
breaking. "We expected to hear from him later the next day, but it never 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight on June 21, the Goodmans got a call from a civil rights 
worker in Mississippi. Their son and the other two men with whom he was 
traveling had disappeared somewhere on the road between Philadelphia and 
Meridian. An all-out search was under way. 
</P>
<P>
The parents later would learn that the three men had been arrested by sheriff's 
deputies for speeding, taken to a jail in Philadelphia, and then released 
around 10 p.m. Civil rights workers had been instructed not to travel through 
the South after dark because of the dangers of violent attacks, and they often 
insisted on spending the night in custody. From the start, the story that the 
three men had willingly left the jail at night seemed suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 44 days, the Goodmans waited anxiously for word of their son. They 
traveled to Washington with members of the Schwerner family and met with 
President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who was coming under heavy criticism from 
activists to play a stronger role in protecting civil rights workers. He 
assured them that FBI agents were doing all they could, but the parents were 
not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Aug. 4, the Goodmans interrupted their tense vigil and tried to 
relax by attending a concert at Lincoln Center. Midway through the performance, 
a family friend came rushing down the aisle with terrible news: Andrew and the 
other two men had been found buried in an earthen dam, according to White House 
officials. The long wait was over. 
</P>
<P>
As she sits in the living room of her Manhattan apartment, Carolyn Goodman 
agonizes in the retelling of her son's death. She still feels rage at the men 
who were indicted and brought to trial. She still finds it hard to believe that 
her son was rearrested after he left the jail and then handed over to a posse 
of Klansmen. Her voice trembles when she asks herself if it would have been 
better to have kept Andy from going to Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
"As a mother, there's nothing worse than losing a son," she says with sadness. 
"There's something about losing a son that's like taking a piece of your life." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman composes herself and proudly shows a visitor the Ben Shahn portrait of 
her boy that hangs in his old bedroom, next to a window facing south. 
</P>
<P>
"I also realize that Andy ennobled my life," she says. "He made me a better 
person. His death, along with the other two, changed the nation, and made it a 
better place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Service Programs 
</P>
<P>
Five years after the killing, Goodman's first husband, Robert, died suddenly. 
Despite these tragedies, she has remarried and remained politically active, 
helping to create social service programs for Third World mothers and working 
to improve relations between Arabs and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
After 25 years, her greatest fear is that people will forget the legacy of 
Freedom Summer. The movement paved the way for tougher civil rights laws, and 
more than 500,000 blacks in Mississippi are now registered to vote, she notes. 
Once a bastion of segregation, Mississippi has more black elected officials 
than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman thumbs through a bound collection of speeches that were delivered at 
her son's memorial service and then gently places the book back on a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything comes out of Andy's death, let it be this," she says. "The 
struggle for freedom continues. It must never end." 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that Mickey was a marked man, from the minute he set foot in 
Mississippi. The Klan was watching him, but he did what he had to do." -- 
Nathan Schwerner, Michael's father 
</P>
<P>
When Michael and Rita Schwerner first came to Mississippi in January, 1964, 
they typified the volunteers who would pour into the state later that summer. 
No strangers to social activism, the two New Yorkers had dedicated their lives 
to the battle against racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, a stocky, sandy-haired young man, and his 21-year-old, dark-haired 
wife were the first white civil rights workers to be posted outside the state 
capitol at Jackson. They became the advance guard for students arriving later, 
and began setting up community centers and voter registration drives in black 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
As the months passed, "Mickey," as he was known to his friends, became close 
friends with James Chaney, a black volunteer, and spent many hours at his small 
home in Meridian. 
</P>
<P>
From the time he entered Meridian, Schwerner became a prime target for white 
racists who were determined to crush the civil rights movement. They didn't 
like his easy-going manner. They detested the fact that he was Jewish. They 
ridiculed his slight growth of beard, calling him "goatee" among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
When it became clear that Schwerner would not leave Meridian, even though 
whites insulted him to his face and harassed his wife with obscene phone calls, 
they decided to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Local Klan members concocted a plan to have deputies arrest Schwerner and then, 
under cover of darkness, turn him over to vigilantes. They were aided in their 
planning by Philadelphia Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price, who hated Schwerner and 
was a secret member of the Klan. 
</P>
<P>
After several false starts, the plot worked like a charm on the afternoon of 
June 21. The three civil rights workers were arrested on trumped-up speeding 
charges as they drove back to Meridian from the burned-out black church and 
were set free late at night. Price re-arrested them on the highway less than an 
hour later and handed them over to the Klan. 
</P>
<P>
To the end, Schwerner was faithful to his belief in nonviolent resistance, and 
even tried to reason with his murderers, telling one of them: "Sir, I know just 
how you feel." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Alarmed 
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the workers set off alarms throughout the civil rights 
community. In Oxford, Ohio, where Rita Schwerner had been helping to conduct 
orientation classes for Freedom Summer volunteers, a mood of desperation set 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"It was everybody's worst fear suddenly come true," says Staughton Lynd, a 
history professor who helped run special schools for blacks during Freedom 
Summer. "We all knew that death was a possibility, but it suddenly hit home. It 
was an awful moment." 
</P>
<P>
Putting her emotions on hold, Rita Schwerner realized that the terrorized 
blacks of Neshoba County would be unlikely to give any information about the 
three missing men to FBI agents. But she felt there was a chance that she might 
be able to pry some information from them. 
</P>
<P>
Late at night, Rita Schwerner and veteran activist Robert Zellner drove into 
the area and began knocking on the doors of black homes. They wanted to keep 
their presence a secret, but the Klan had spotted them and set up an elaborate 
trap. Just before dawn, a group of vigilantes in six pickup trucks began 
chasing Schwerner and Zellner down a narrow highway. Up ahead, they had blocked 
the road with a flatbed truck. 
</P>
<P>
"I was terrified, because it looked like they wanted to kill us," says Zellner, 
who had floored the accelerator of his old Corvair. "But Rita was incredibly 
cool and in control. She never lost sight of the overriding issues, she was all 
Movement." 
</P>
<P>
As he raced through the darkness at 60 m.p.h., Zellner decided that his only 
chance of escape was to veer off the road and drive through the trees around 
the flatbed truck. Clutching the wheel, he skidded through the woods, careened 
back onto the roadway and roared on toward Meridian. The stunned Klansmen began 
cursing as the Corvair sped out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few days, she would angrily confront officials ranging from Sheriff 
Rainey and Mississippi Gov. Paul Johnson to U.S. Attorney General Nicholas 
Katzenbach and President Johnson. Brushing aside all niceties, she demanded 
information about her husband and the other two men. In a hastily arranged 
White House visit, she expressed anger that Johnson had not done more to aid 
the search, and curtly declined his offers of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a social call," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Woman 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who covered Rita Schwerner at the time remember a strong, determined 
woman who always seemed to put the civil rights cause ahead of her personal 
tragedy. But soon after Mickey's body was found, the depths of her sorrow came 
across in a television interview. 
</P>
<P>
"In a very selfish way I was afraid that something would happen to him, because 
if something happened to him, what would I do?" she said, seeming to fight back 
tears. "I loved him very much, I was very dependent on him. And I think he was 
worried that if something happened to him, what would I do? 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't discussed it a lot, but we were aware of the possibility, and it 
influenced our relationship," she said. "We knew we'd better make the best of 
it now, because it might not be a marriage that was going to last for 50 
years." 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, Michael Schwerner's father and widow have continued to 
speak out on civil rights. Nathan Schwerner, now in his 80s, cautions that 
people should remember the larger issues of Freedom Summer rather than 
memorializing his son. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Schwerner, 46, got a law degree, remarried and started a new life in 
Washington state. Today, she is reluctant to talk about the impact of Freedom 
Summer on her personal life and discourages most overtures from the press. But 
she has strong words about the 25th anniversary and its meaning for the rest of 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to remember that summer for all the right reasons," she says in 
a telephone interview. "Of course, three families were devastated by this. But 
you should be thinking about the people who continue to be affected by racism. 
That's the real story." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want us all to stand up here together and say just one thing. I want the 
sheriff to hear this good. We ain't scared no more of Sheriff Rainey." -- Ben 
Chaney, Aug. 14, 1964, at a memorial service for his brother 
</P>
<P>
Like any other 11-year-old, Ben Chaney idolized his older brother, James. He 
tried to dress like him, talk like him and, when James got involved in the 
Mississippi civil rights movement, he wanted to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
But his mother, Fannie Lee, laid down the law. It was dangerous enough for one 
of her sons to risk his life. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, it took great courage for Mississippi blacks to demand the right to 
vote. Klan violence was a constant threat, and law enforcement officials could 
not be depended on for even basic protection. Years before, Chaney's mother had 
been terrorized when her uncle was lynched for no apparent reason. The family 
never found his body, but they did get the man's watch and his shirt, neatly 
folded, in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why his brother decided to join the civil rights movement, Ben, now 36 
and living in New York, says it was simple destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time in the South, every black person was trying to cross the line. 
They wanted some excuse to cross the line. When that chance came, you took it." 
</P>
<P>
For James Chaney, the moment came when he accidentally sat on a bus next to 
some freedom riders in the early 1960s. Inspired by their commitment, he began 
taking other freedom rides. Earlier, he had been expelled from school for 
wearing NAACP paper buttons. Although Chaney's mother feared for his safety, 
there was no turning back. 
</P>
<P>
Several years later, when Mickey Schwerner needed a partner to help him launch 
voter registration drives in Neshoba County, Chaney was a logical choice. The 
good-looking, slightly built young man was friendly with blacks in the 
Klan-infested area, and he was also a skilled driver who knew the twisting 
country roads better than most. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Chaney had made plans to link up with his brother and Schwerner the night 
of June 21, and he was stunned when they never showed up. Soon, the Chaney 
household went into a state of shock. Ben's mother would clean her house four 
and five times a day, bursting into tears without warning. His two older 
sisters said little, waiting for some sign of their brother. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Klan members tormented the family. There were several attempts to 
firebomb the Chaney home and the neighborhood was plagued with cross burnings. 
Soon, the family gave up hope that James was alive. Everybody, that is, except 
Ben. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure he'd be found, because I admired him so much, I looked up to him so 
much," he says, sitting at a desk in his office. "He had all the right moves, 
he got all the girls. He was my big brother. And I guess I didn't believe he 
was dead until I saw him buried in the ground." 
</P>
<P>
There is a famous photograph of Ben Chaney at his brother's funeral, tears 
streaming down his face, as the congregation begins to sing "We Shall 
Overcome." But the most dramatic moment came several weeks later, when he 
defied Sheriff Rainey at a memorial service. The sheriff, who later would be 
charged in the murders, had inexplicably shown up at the gathering and young 
Chaney was infuriated. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, family members urged him to calm down and forget about reprisals. 
But something had snapped inside the 11-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that something should happen to the people who did this," he recalls 
with bitterness. "And I felt that I should be the one to do something to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that had my father, my grandfathers, if all these people had been more 
aggressive in the past, my brother wouldn't be going into the ground. It was an 
anger I had never experienced before." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Chaney's cynicism grew when the celebrated case finally came to trial. 
Mississippi officials, reluctant to offend white voters, had announced that 
they would not be able to prosecute the murders because there were no 
witnesses. When the U.S. government later decided to pursue convictions under 
federal law, the results were decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, 19 men were indicted for depriving the three victims of their civil 
rights, including Rainey and his deputy, Price. But only eight were convicted 
and Judge William Harold Cox, a stubborn segregationist, handed out sentences 
ranging from three to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They killed one nigger, one Jew and a white man," Cox later explained. "I gave 
them all what I thought they deserved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Last Straw 
</P>
<P>
The 1964 killings had been the last straw for many black activists, and by the 
end of the year they angrily abandoned the policies of nonviolent resistance. 
Soon, more militant black leaders began dominating the civil rights movement, 
and they insisted that whites relinquish positions of power and influence. When 
the verdicts in the Mississippi case came down, blacks and whites who once 
worked together were going separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Ben's life also had undergone a radical change. The Goodmans, 
concerned for the Chaneys' safety, offered to help them relocate in New York 
City. They would help the family find housing and promised a scholarship for 
Ben at the progressive Walden school. 
</P>
<P>
The Chaneys accepted and moved to Manhattan in 1965. It was a chance to start 
clean. But the memory of James Chaney would continue to haunt his younger 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York, it was a whole new world," says Ben. "I felt secure living in an 
integrated building, but there was still poverty. I wanted to be rich. I wanted 
to live in that world where you get off the elevator and you're right there in 
your living room." 
</P>
<P>
Although he was a bright student, Ben lagged behind his rich white classmates. 
Teachers remembered that he always seemed to be under great pressure. Looking 
back, Carolyn Goodman wonders whether she did the right thing in bringing the 
Chaneys to New York. Although safety was the main concern, she said the boy 
seemed disoriented by the sudden change. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben did have a hard time because he was thrust into a world he never made or 
didn't know. I think that was very difficult for him. We'd heard that he was 
really struggling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Black Militants 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Chaney began spending time with a group of black militants in Harlem. His 
brother had become a martyr in civil rights circles, and the boy felt pressured 
to live up to his example. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I became a product of change," he says sadly. "As the movement 
changed, black people went from nonviolence to become more aggressive, more 
militant. And I changed also. I tried to be political, but I guess you could 
say I was a victim of propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Chaney hooked up with Lindsay Lee Thompson, a former black Vietnam 
veteran. Thompson invited him and another man to drive down to Florida, 
ostensibly to visit Thompson's mother. On April 24, the trio began a journey 
that eventually turned into a criminal rampage. When it was over three weeks 
later, four white people had been randomly shot to death. Chaney was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
At the trial, Chaney's lawyers argued that Thompson had done all the shootings 
and that Ben, who had driven the car, had no idea what he had gotten himself 
into. They argued that Thompson had taunted the boy, suggesting that his 
brother's death should be avenged. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was never accused of pulling the trigger, Ben served 13 years for a 
crime he said he didn't commit. To this day, he is embittered that the white 
men who killed his brother did less time, and that others who were implicated 
in the crime walked free. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't forget that," he says. "For me, this whole story never really 
came to an end. It just kept coming back all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Ben Chaney is a paralegal working in the office of veteran civil rights 
activist Ramsey Clark. He also heads a foundation in his brother's memory that 
is dedicated to sponsoring voter registration drives in the South and New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
A slight man with sad and tired eyes, Chaney says prison has washed him clean. 
These days, he is trying to focus on the positive things that came out of 
Freedom Summer so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us, blacks and whites, especially blacks and Jews, had a special time 
when we worked together," says Chaney. "But we destroyed that bond. Somehow we 
have to come back together again, we have to get back to that point." 
</P>
<P>
Were the deaths of Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney worth it 
all? 
</P>
<P>
Ben Chaney's quiet answer recalls a time when everything seemed possible -- and 
good intentions could change the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I think it was worth it," he says. "After everything that's happened in 
this country, I still want to believe that the best is yet to come."

O.C. 'SORCERY' FUND-RAISER GOES POOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Playhouse has canceled its June 19 "Summer Sorcery" benefit in the face 
of allegations by a local minister that the fund-raising event would be an 
occasion "to mix alcohol and the practice of the occult." 
</P>
<P>
The Playhouse, in the midst of a campaign to raise money for its expansion into 
the 17,000-square-foot General Telephone building, had sent invitations to 
supporters saying, "Your Magical Evening Under the Stars includes: Divine 
Dancing, Enchanting Edibles, Decadent Desserts, Liberal Libation, Plus: 
Prediction and Prognostications by Professional Astrologers, Palmists, Crystal 
Gazers, Numerologists, Psychics, Clairvoyants, Aura Readers, Psychometrists, 
Past-Life Readers, Psychic Artists, Rune Stones, Star Cards, Tarot Cards, 
Channelers, Kirlian Photographer." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the event, which was to be held at the Laguna Beach estate of 
Constance Morthland, were $75. The initial response was strong, Playhouse 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Rev. Jerry Tankersley of Laguna Presbyterian Church mailed a 
flyer to congregation members that said, in part: 
</P>
<P>
"It may well be that this gathering of occult professionals is nothing but 
entertainment, but I am concerned about a major cultural institution of our 
city becoming identified with those who are representatives and voices of 
spiritual powers that at times have proven to be destructive of human life." 
</P>
<P>
Tankersley's letter then urged congregants to "continue to support the 
Playhouse, but let it be known that this program is inappropriate for our city. 
The Playhouse is ill advised to give these occult professionals a platform for 
their magic, their arts or their entertainment skills." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Morthland and Playhouse officials agreed that the benefit 
should not be held at her residence. When an alternative site could not be 
found in time, the event was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Playhouse supporters who had already sent money for tickets will soon be 
receiving a letter explaining the cancellation with their refunds. The letters 
say that "unfortunately, some members of the community took exception to our 
program, particularly to the inclusion of psychics." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Murphy, director of marketing and public relations for the Playhouse, 
said the cancellation will cost the Playhouse about $3,000 -- mostly for 
printing of invitations -- in addition to an anticipated loss of $30,000 to 
$40,000 that had been expected to be raised through a silent auction. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed that the event was canceled," Murphy said. "We are 
aware of Rev. Tankersley's letter, and we respect his right to his opinion, 
although we do disagree with him. We're not looking for a confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that the Playhouse did not receive a copy of the minister's mailing 
but that Tankersley did contact the Playhouse a week before his mailing went 
out, telling about his objections. 
</P>
<P>
Morthland, a longtime Playhouse supporter who is not a member of Tankersley's 
congregation, said that she did not see a copy of his mailing but that she "did 
receive some letters and some calls" as a result of the mailing. 
</P>
<P>
She said the canceled program would have been "completely innocent." 
</P>
<P>
Morthland told Playhouse officials about the communiques then left them to make 
the final decision. She said she expects to hold future Playhouse benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Rowe, the Playhouse's artistic director, called Tankersley's letter "a 
bolt from the blue," particularly because "relations with the church have never 
been anything but cordial and supportive" in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The program, he said, would have been "harmless. It just seemed like a real fun 
evening and a way to raise money for our building." 
</P>
<P>
Tankersley said Wednesday that he was unaware of the cancellation and that he 
expected "some flak" as a result of it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, both the Playhouse and the church voiced interest in moving into the 
GTE Building in downtown Laguna Beach.

KLSX WANTS TO RAISE CHINA RELIEF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the violence in China, KLSX-FM (97.1) launched a campaign 
Wednesday to raise money for China Relief, a humanitarian agency. But morning 
talk-show host Peter Tilden conceded that "there are no guarantees" how or when 
the money will be spent. 
</P>
<P>
Tilden, who is spearheading the fund-raising drive on his 6-to-9:30 a.m. 
program, said at a press conference that hundreds of the "classic rock" 
station's listeners had called during the last few weeks asking how they could 
help the pro-democracy movement in China. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be given to China Relief through the American Red Cross and the 
World Council of Churches, officials said, to be used "for humanitarian 
purposes only," including "food, clothing, shelter as well as medicines in a 
time of crisis." 
</P>
<P>
On a day when the Chinese government was officially saying that only 100 
students had been killed, however, both Tilden and publicist Michael Venema 
said that they cannot guarantee that the money they raise will not be used on 
behalf of the soldiers who crushed the rebellion rather than on behalf of the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"The unusual thing here is that the Chinese government at this time is denying 
that there is a crisis," the station and Venema said in a joint press release. 
</P>
<P>
Venema represents Ice House, a comedy club in Pasadena, which is holding 
"Benefit for Beijing" June 26 at $25 a head. KLSX is promoting that event as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the potential for violent change is right there," the statement said. 
"We at KLSX-FM want to create a fund drive to have money and services in place 
in the very likely possibility that the unrest we've seen in China for the last 
month intensifies." 
</P>
<P>
KLSX is asking for checks to be made out to China Relief. Listeners are being 
told to send their checks to the station, said Julie Cahill, KLSX's promotional 
director. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Red Cross here said that the Chinese Red Cross or China 
Relief "will accept the money, but they haven't asked for it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked when the money will be used, she answered: "When they have need for it. 
The money will go to the Chinese Red Cross and they will use it as they see fit 
in their humanitarian work." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about concerns about who will benefit from the money, the spokeswoman 
explained: "The Red Cross is a neutral organization. The Red Cross does not 
take sides. We can't take sides for the military, we can't take sides for the 
students." 
</P>
<P>
Tilden likened the fund-raising drive to the money raised on behalf of cleaning 
up the Alaska oil spill. On April 13, the station began a drive that thus far 
has raised $5,830. The station also sent 10 of its listeners for 10 days to 
Alaska at a cost of $9,250. Cahill said the station sent veterinarians, experts 
on birds and communication coordinators.

CHRISTIE'S PUTS POP ON THE BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood rummage mongers, trash pickers and garage-sale mavens listen up. 
There are diamonds among secondhand celebrity pickings; gold to be found in 
star dust bins. 
</P>
<P>
How about Elvis Presley's black-belt karate degree? Or Boris Karloff's driver's 
license application? Frank Sinatra's cigarette lighter, Brooke Shields' Calvin 
Klein blue jeans or John Lennon's wristwatch? 
</P>
<P>
They're worth thousands of bucks, according to Christie's East, which hosts its 
annual pop memorabilia auction Wednesday. Public display of the Manhattan 
auction house's stellar-priced kitsch begins Friday after today's press 
preview, which Christie's chief film buff and memorabilia auctioneer hopes will 
hype interest in the 448 items to an unprecedented fever pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally unpredictable," said Eric Alberta, who will be handling the 
four-hour sale. "I know that there will be a piece in this sale that will go 
far beyond my expectations. Price valuations get real tricky. You can't predict 
what kind of emotional tie a buyer might have to an item." 
</P>
<P>
But Alberta tries. Some items are easier to price than others. 
</P>
<P>
He figures some bidder's emotional tie to a psychedelic 1956 Bentley that once 
carted the Beatles around London will be worth between $800,000 and $1 million. 
Christie's considers the Beatles' Bentley a rich enough item to rate its own 
12-page full-color brochure. The car, which was once on display at Buena Park's 
Movieland Wax Museum, currently belongs to photographer Yulla Lipchitz and New 
York psychic Biond Fury. In the brochure, Fury quotes from his upcoming book, 
"John Lennon and Biond Living at the Point of Magic," about the moment he found 
the Bentley in a Kansas City bank garage: 
</P>
<P>
"First the Bentley was solid white, then it turned into all of the colors of 
the rainbow as it drove out of the darkness coming toward me in vision with the 
headlights shining, shining through the night. It was almost as if it were 
coming to me from the other side, from the spirit world. It was almost as if it 
were moving from the astral plane, moving into the light of reality, moving 
into materialization on the material or earth plane." 
</P>
<P>
If the vintage sedan with its Peter Max-like exterior and purple leather 
interior commands even the low figure, it will be the single most expensive 
secondhand celebrity collectible that Christie's has ever sold, according to 
Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the record is held by a pair of Dorothy's ruby slippers from "The 
Wizard of Oz" that were bought last year for $165,000, Alberta said. Another 
set of slippers sold back in 1981 for $13,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't simple inflation in the ruby-slipper market that has jacked up prices, 
Alberta said. Any nostalgia item that smacks of movie or pop music has suddenly 
become big business. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into it because I've always liked the fun art rather than the fine art," 
he said. "But people are starting to recognize the fun art as fine art. There's 
a lot more freedom in collecting in the last part of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Who would ever have thought one of Elvis' guitar picks (initialed E.P. and 
accompanied by a notarized letter of authenticity from two of Presley's 
cousins) might go for $200 to $250? Or that his concealed-weapons permit, 
issued by the Denver Police Department, might command $2,000 to $3,000? 
</P>
<P>
There are the predictable items (autographed record albums, movie costumes, 
signed publicity stills, etc.), but there are plenty of bona fide one-of-a-kind 
unique pieces too. Alberta's personal favorite is the Cowardly Lion's "Witch 
Remover" from "The Wizard of Oz" -- a 28-inch-long spray can that Bert Lahr 
used when stalking Margaret Hamilton in the Haunted Forest. Asking price: 
$15,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The item that promises to bring on the most interest from serious students of 
Hollywood is screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz's bound manuscript of the 
original scripts for "Citizen Kane" (see accompanying article). The expected 
auction price is $70,000 to $90,000, including several other scripts and 
letters turned over to Christie's by the writer's sons, Frank and Donald 
Mankiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
"I also like the telegram from Leslie Howard to Jack Warner," Alberta said. 
</P>
<P>
For $3,000 to $4,000, a movie buff can have Howard's framed 1934 cable from 
Glasgow, Scotland, in which the actor threatened not to appear in the film 
version of the hit Broadway play "The Petrified Forest" unless the actor who 
played opposite him was also cast in the picture. The telegram reads: 
</P>
<P>
"Insist Bogart play Mantee. Stop. No Bogart no deal. Stop. L.H." 
</P>
<P>
Warner backed off on his first choice for the role of fugitive Duke Mantee, 
Edward G. Robinson, and cast Humphrey Bogart opposite Howard and Bette Davis. 
The picture is credited with making Bogart a star. 
</P>
<P>
C hristie's will also be liquidating trolls, teddy bears, witch-doctor dolls, 
wigs, false eyelashes and other property from the estate of Harris Glenn 
Milstead, a.k.a. Divine. Among the 101 items in the late, hefty transvestite's 
wardrobe are a purple Spandex minidress ($300-$400), red satin wrap ($200-$300) 
and a "rhinestone snowflake" dress Milstead was allegedly wearing on stage at 
the Red Parrot nightclub when he said: 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy Reagan gave me this dress -- of course, I had to take it in a little." 
</P>
<P>
The memorabilia sale was an annual event until last year, according to Alberta, 
but a growing interest in things nostalgic turned it into a twice-a-year 
spectacle. He is already checking trade publications and planning a West Coast 
trip in late summer to comb warehouses and Hollywood garage sales for next 
December's sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Film and rock 'n' roll are both mediums that have become a universal 
language," he said. "If you show a picture of Charlie Chaplin in Sweden or New 
York or Paris, it's going to be recognized. Music and the movies are an 
international language. They're something everybody can share. 
</P>
<P>
"And if you're just scoping in on the American scene, it becomes even more 
specific. These are the things we live with. 'The Wizard of Oz' is something I 
grew up with and my nephew watches it now and gets scared just the way I did. A 
lot of these things have gone into the mainstream of American culture." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, when he was parked in front of the TV set watching old 
movies, Alberta's parents used to rail at him the way parents do today when 
their children are glued to "Nickelodeon" sitcom reruns or "The Wonder Years" 
or some other manifestation of the nation's entertainment past. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to yell: 'What're you going to do when you grow up when all you do 
is watch old movies all the time?' " Alberta said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
If they had only known, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fantasy becomes reality becomes fantasy," he said. "I don't know here it 
ends."

PROTESTERS SEEK KVEA EXEC'S OUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR VALLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in two weeks, KVEA Channel 52 found itself beset on 
Wednesday by 30 angry demonstrators outside its Glendale offices protesting the 
Spanish-language station's alleged insensitivity to its majority audience of 
Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the demonstrators attempted to raise the stakes by 
demanding the ouster of Stephen J. Levin, KVEA's vice president and general 
manager. They accused him of failing to meet with them to discuss recent news 
department personnel changes -- including the departure of Mexican-American 
news director Bob Navarro -- that they say have eliminated Mexicans and 
Mexican-Americans from KVEA senior management. 
</P>
<P>
"Channel 52 owes an explanation to our community," said Antonio Rodriguez, 
director of the Latino Community Justice Center, one of about a dozen local 
political, labor and community organizations represented in the picketing 
outside Los Angeles' No. 2 Spanish-language station. 
</P>
<P>
"How is it they can say there are no qualified Mexicans to run the station when 
it was Mexican administrators who got this station off the ground?" Rodriguez 
asked. "That's an assault to our dignity. This is especially bad when you have 
a company that benefits directly from the Mexican community." 
</P>
<P>
Station officials said that Levin was not available for comment, and 
representatives of KVEA's parent Telemundo network in New York were also 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
KVEA's critics claim that Navarro's dismissal was the last straw in a 
long-simmering dissatisfaction with the station. The protesters criticized 
KVEA's programming practices, Levin's alleged inability to speak Spanish and 
Telemundo's failure to retain and promote Mexicans and Mexican-Americans such 
as KVEA's former general manager Frank Cruz, who resigned in February. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems very unfair that none of our people are in management when you have a 
station which is broadcasting to an audience that is over 90% Mexican," said 
protest organizer Raul Ruiz, a Chicano studies professor at Cal State 
Northridge. (Recent marketing studies indicate that Mexicans and 
Mexican-Americans make up 80% to 85% of the Latino population in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz also wondered how a general manager could run a station without having a 
strong command of Spanish or broad understanding of Mexican and Latino cultural 
and social realities. 
</P>
<P>
Levin, in a previous interview, insisted that he did have a working knowledge 
of Spanish that permitted him to make qualitative judgments about station 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
And Telemundo officials have previously defended Levin's efforts to restructure 
KVEA's news department, arguing that improvements were needed after a recent 
ratings decline. These officials have also suggested that it would be 
discriminatory to insist that KVEA's news director or other senior managers be 
selected on the basis of their national origin. 
</P>
<P>
But Ruiz argued that this assertion does not stand up in Los Angeles, where the 
Spanish-speaking population is overwhelmingly Mexican and Mexican-American. 
</P>
<P>
"I know some people have tried to twist our concerns into reverse racism," he 
said. "That's nonsense. It's not being racist to ask that some, not all, of our 
people be hired to these positions. In fact, it's equally racist to imply that 
all Hispanics are the same. It's like saying all Europeans are the same." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's picketing was the latest development in a controversy that erupted 
last month at KVEA's rival station, KMEX Channel 34, when more than half the 
station's employees signed a petition expressing fears that Mexicans and 
Mexican-Americans faced losing key programming and management jobs at the 
station and its parent Univision network. 
</P>
<P>
But the controversy changed channels last month after the departure of three 
KVEA news employees, including Navarro, a veteran Mexican-American reporter who 
claimed that he was fired after seven months as news director. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders such as Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund, rose to Navarro's defense and chastised 
KVEA's parent network, Telemundo. About 30 university students and community 
organizers picketed outside KVEA on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
KVEA also came under fire from the National Hispanic Media Coalition, an 
umbrella organization for several national and local Latino organizations, 
which fired off a letter to Telemundo's corporate headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the coalition claimed that employment documents in KVEA's 
public file show only token support of Latino community organizations. 
Moreover, the letter said that the network has only one Latino on its board of 
directors and no Latino directors on the board of Reliance Capital Group, the 
corporate holding company that controls the network and its six 
owned-and-operated stations, including KVEA. 
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely troubling to the coalition," the letter said, "that a TV 
station as profitable as KVEA would give so little in return to the community 
from which it reaps its profits." 
</P>
<P>
Telemundo officials offered earlier this week to meet with the National 
Hispanic Media Coalition and the community groups represented by Ruiz. But no 
date has been set.

The Irvine City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday to put off until next week its 
decision on whether to establish a municipal arts commission, as recommended by 
a two-year study commission funded by the city. On Tuesday, when the council 
meets to consider budget matters for the coming year, it will decide whether to 
fund the new five-member commission. City officials said that the first year's 
operation of the commission would cost under $50,000, although when fully set 
up and staffed the body would have an annual operating cost between $300,000 
and $800,000. With the vote Tuesday, said Donald Rickner, dean of outreach and 
community relations at Irvine Valley College and chairman of the city's 
exploratory arts committee, "I think we moved one more step down the line" 
toward establishment of the commission.

POP BEAT / RANDY LEWIS: ROCK CLUB BUCKS THE PAY-TO-PLAY TREND 
</P>

When Troy Tabak and Randy Noteboom took over Joshua's Parlour in Westminster 
last year and renamed it the Marquee, they decided to turn it into an oddity in 
the world of hard rock and heavy metal: a nightclub that pays its performers. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, "pay to play" is the rule. At major Southland clubs from the Country 
Club in Reseda and the Roxy, Whisky and Gazzarri's on the Sunset Strip to 
Jezebel's in Anaheim and Goodies in Fullerton, bands frequently are required to 
purchase $100, $200 or more worth of tickets before they will be given places 
on the schedule. If they want to make money, or break even or whatever, they 
then have to go out and sell the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
But Noteboom, who serves as Marquee's booking agent, promoter and manager, will 
have none of that. 
</P>
<P>
Noteboom, who has a reputation as a friend of struggling rockers, said: "The 
way I look at it, bands do what they do for a living. They are artists, and 
even if a lot of them aren't the greatest in the world, they should get paid 
for their art. If I was to do presale ticketing, we would make a helluva lot 
more money. But I'm in it to have bands doing what they do without having to 
pay to play." 
</P>
<P>
Noteboom said he typically arranges a mutually acceptable flat fee with a band 
in advance, rather than track the number of customers who come to see each 
group. ("It seems this way is more professional," he said.) A new band starting 
in a weeknight slot might get $50 or $100, and, if they prove to have 
significant draws, can graduate to more lucrative weekend shows. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, I think it's definitely going to help us," Noteboom said. And 
indeed, after about five months of live shows, the trend-bucking gamble seems 
to be paying off at the 450-capacity club. While Joshua's had lost its audience 
-- as well as its liquor license -- in its latter days, Tabak and Noteboom are 
trying to prove that the dead can rise again. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-rock fans, who are known to be particularly avid club-goers, are returning 
in sufficient quantity to keep Tabak and Noteboom happy. In addition, bands are 
calling for bookings in increasing numbers as word spreads that they won't be 
required to buy their way onto the Marquee's refurbished and enlarged stage. 
"I'll get bands," he said, "that call up for a booking and ask, 'How many 
tickets do we have to buy?' I'd say 'None,' and they'd say 'Geez, it's so 
strange getting paid.' " 
</P>
<P>
If the bands noticeably appreciate the change, so do their agents. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the Marquee," said Shelly Berggren, a booking agent with Tapestry 
Artists who handles 14 local bands, mostly hard rock and metal. "The people 
there are easy to work with, nice people, and they know what they are doing. 
They know which bands can draw and which can't, which bands to put with other 
bands." 
</P>
<P>
Even stranger than the payment arrangement: Joshua's is an Orange County 
live-music club -- and one that caters to the stereotypically rowdy metal 
crowd, to boot -- that actually is sitting pretty with the local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"They police themselves, and they are very good about checking I.D. over 
there," said Officer Tom Broderson of the Westminster Police Department. 
"They've had very few problems. Occasionally they get the guys that square off 
in the parking lot, but you have that anywhere. Other than that, they've got a 
nice club and they are really trying to keep the reputation up. 
</P>
<P>
"We do our usual checks through the parking lots for intoxicated people, but 
they've had very few problems. Hopefully it'll stay that way," Broderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon buying Joshua's last July, Tabak, 29, enlisted Noteboom, 27, to oversee 
key aspects of the club's operation. Together they formed a partnership called 
Exclusive Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"Troy saw the potential of the club and its location," Noteboom said. "All that 
was needed was to put something into it. So we've made the stage twice as big 
as it was, opened up the ceiling, hired new working personnel and made it more 
of a fun atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
In turn, he said, "our clientele has gotten a lot nicer, and there have not 
been as many problems as Joshua's had." 
</P>
<P>
The Marquee books bands playing original songs four of the five nights it's 
open each week (Tuesdays and Sundays are dark, and on Thursdays the house band 
plays covers). Admission is typically $5 or $6, but goes up to $8 for some of 
the better-known acts that come through, Noteboom said. 
</P>
<P>
While Mondays and Wednesdays offer all-original lineups, Fridays and Saturdays 
are "Showcase Spotlight" nights, in which one original band is sandwiched 
between sets by a hard-rock cover band. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the only club I know of that does this format. I couldn't see it working 
in Hollywood, but it's doing fantastic here. 
</P>
<P>
"This way, there are no egos to deal with in having three other bands fighting 
over where they are on the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
The Marquee has been trying to attract bands with record contracts as well as 
struggling local groups, and has hosted the likes of Skid Row (which is opening 
some Bon Jovi dates) and Extreme. 
</P>
<P>
A July 5 gig with Shark Island is the club's next show with a major-label 
touring act. 
</P>
<P>
CRUZ CONTROL -- Big Drill Car, a punk-influenced rock band from Huntington 
Beach, has signed with Cruz Records and is set to start recording its first 
album for the label next week. 
</P>
<P>
Big Drill Car got rolling last year with "Small Block," an EP that the band 
released on its own. It subsequently set about building a name for itself with 
do-it-yourself national touring. 
</P>
<P>
Big Drill Car and All play Saturday at Night Moves in Huntington Beach.

I think that I shall never see 
</P>
<P>
a poem lovely as a tree. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Poems are made by fools like me, 
</P>
<P>
But only God can make a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Kilmer's famous poem, "Trees," first appeared in the early 1900s. And 
although Irvine was not created until more than a half-century later, one might 
think he had actually strolled through the city's Deerfield neighborhood on a 
spring day -- then sat down and wrote the poem. Trees dominate the area, 
particularly lavender-blooming jacarandas, which line most of the streets in 
this sleepy neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Deerfield is just off Culver Drive near Irvine Center Drive, between the Santa 
Ana and San Diego freeways. A pair of oversize signs etched with the word 
Deerfield and deers' heads mark the district's entrance on Culver Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Deerfield, built in the mid-1970s, is a mixture of townhouses and single-family 
homes. The virtual elimination of through streets and long straightaways gives 
it an enclave feeling more common to private compounds. And the use of the 
zero-lot-line layout, a concept that places the house on its lot line and makes 
all surrounding space usable, gives Deerfield's single-family homes a look not 
normally associated with developments. 
</P>
<P>
Home appreciation is no stranger to Deerfield, either. Townhouses ranged from 
$38,000 to $69,000 when they went on the market in October, 1974. Today they 
fetch upward of $175,000. Single-family residences that opened in January, 
1975, with prices from $55,000 to $70,000 now bring $300,000. At the center of 
the neighborhood is a 10-acre park, offering the amenities that most community 
parks have, such as tennis, racquetball and volleyball courts. 
</P>
<P>
Don James, a student at Orange Coast College and community park leader, 
believes Deerfield has another asset that complements its arboreal charms. "The 
kids here are great; they are very well behaved," he says. "This must be a 
direct reflection on their parents and how they're being brought up. I enjoy 
working here." 
</P>
<P>
According to David Flint, president of the Deerfield Community Assn., the most 
prominent neighborhood issue during the last five years has been whether to 
build a new railroad overcrossing at Yale Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The existing overpass -- a covered, quaint (at least by modern standards) 
affair -- has for years served pedestrians crossing the Santa Fe tracks. And 
its narrow construction pretty much precludes any kind of wheeled traffic 
except bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal to expand the bridge into a full-blown traffic crossing brought the 
matter to grief. Such a bridge would have made Yale an unbroken traffic artery 
running from the West Yale Loop, through Deerfield, and all the way to the 
northern city limits. 
</P>
<P>
After a prolonged battle between residents and the City Council, and even a 
lawsuit filed by three residents, the neighborhood got what it wanted -- sort 
of. In lieu of a multilane public traffic overcrossing, the bridge to be built 
will be limited to bicycles, walkers and emergency vehicles. Construction is 
under way, with completion expected this fall. 
</P>
<P>
One thing Deerfield does not need, neighbors agree, is cross-town traffic fumes 
fouling the tree blossoms.

TEACHING THE 'PAYOFFS AND SPINOFFS' OF CONVERSATION'S FLUID ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mort Stein walked into his local drugstore in Newport Beach a few weeks ago to 
pick up a package of cotton balls. He asked a bored-looking stock clerk to 
direct him to the proper aisle, then walked back over, cotton balls in hand, 
and asked another question. 
</P>
<P>
"Excuse me," he said. "Could you tell me if these are good with chocolate 
sauce?" 
</P>
<P>
The stock clerk gave Stein a puzzled look, then broke into a grin, "Probably 
one of the few grins he'd had all day," Stein says, smiling himself as he 
remembers the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Stein says, whenever he goes into that store, the clerk hits him 
with a new recipe for serving cotton balls -- on crackers, with cheese, 
whatever. They have quite a conversation going. 
</P>
<P>
And that, Stein says, is exactly the point. 
</P>
<P>
The amusing opener is just one of the techniques Stein will be offering in 
"Payoffs and Spinoffs Through the Art of Conversation," a six-week class 
beginning Monday at Newport Beach's Vin Jorgensen Center. 
</P>
<P>
Other points to be covered include conversing with the opposite sex, handling 
loudmouths and how to use small talk judiciously and effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Conversation is a neglected art these days, says Stein, who is a consultant on 
the subject to businesses and teaches doctors, lawyers and managers how to 
converse effectively. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for conversation's decline, he says, has been the proliferation of 
high-tech communication methods. "As technology increases, conversation 
decreases," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Too many of us spend our days staring at computer screens and our nights 
staring at TVs, Stein says, leaving precious little time for human interaction, 
whether with co-workers, families, friends or strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"People are forgetting how to communicate the old-fashioned way," he says. 
</P>
<P>
When we do get together with others at social or business gatherings, he says, 
"a lot of people feel a little left out. They wonder, 'How do I get into the 
conversation without sounding silly?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising how many people fall into this category. They're good, 
intelligent, well-educated folks, but they're not comfortable in social 
gatherings." 
</P>
<P>
But as Stein teaches -- by example -- sounding silly can often be a good way to 
begin a conversation, or enter an existing one. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to put people at ease," he says, "to make them feel better in your 
presence. They may be nervous, uptight, overworked or knocked out by the 
freeways. You can make them relax by making them laugh a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
What if you're the type who just can't tell a joke? You jump the punch line, or 
your delivery just isn't compelling enough? Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to associate humor with jokes," Stein says, "but jokes are the 
poorest kind of humor. Leave jokes to the professionals. They know how to use 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he says, concentrate on situational humor, talking about amusing 
situations to which others can relate. Or use the cotton ball approach -- 
something unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
But humor is not the only way to make the people around you feel comfortable, 
he says: "I'm a great believer in the art of the compliment. People deserve to 
be noticed, and they have a terrible hunger to be noticed. You can never go 
wrong by noticing people. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you get people who say, 'But I don't want to sound insincere' (in giving 
compliments). Then don't be. Be honest. With everybody, there's something nice 
you can say." 
</P>
<P>
The next step, Stein says, is to offer your conversational partner "a little 
information that could be of use to them. You want to leave people saying, 'I 
love to be around (that person) because he always gives me something 
interesting to think about.' " 
</P>
<P>
"But what do you talk about?" Stein's students ask him. His advice: Turn off 
the TV and start reading. Even if you have just 15 minutes a day to spare for a 
newspaper, go through it, pick out even one story, so you will have something 
to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
"You must take the responsibility for helping to create good conversation, not 
simply to react," Stein says. 
</P>
<P>
Encourage the people around you to talk. Ask what they think about what's going 
on in sports, current events, the course of interest rates. "You'll never get 
hurt asking questions," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's small talk. "It's nice to have a little in the repertoire," he 
says. "But I like to use the metaphor of the Lazy Susan. At the average party, 
the stuff in the Lazy Susan is likely to be peanuts, potato chips, the same old 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"In your conversational Lazy Susan, you want to have the equivalent of things 
like Brie cheese, smoked oysters and pate. Seek out information to restock your 
mental Lazy Susan, and you can leave the realm of small talk." 
</P>
<P>
But how do you avoid being boring, even with a stockpile of facts? 
</P>
<P>
"Take those facts and try to put them into a larger frame of reference," he 
says. "Try to deal with the question of what does this all mean." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of us may be the wallflower type when it comes to conversation, a 
vocal minority do not have that problem. They talk whether or not they have 
anything to say, and whether or not anyone is listening. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are techniques for diverting loudmouths without offending or cutting 
them off at the pockets," Stein says. 
</P>
<P>
"Jump in and say, 'That's a very interesting point. And speaking of 
interesting. . . .' Then you can turn the conversation in another direction." 
</P>
<P>
It does not matter if you are single or married, Stein says, everybody gets a 
little nervous talking to the opposite sex.

Singles make the mistake of using initial conversations for screening potential 
partners. "It's very unsubtle, and it makes people very ill at ease," he says. 
"Stop shopping and instead relax and try to find some common ground." 
</P>
<P>
The common-ground approach works for marrieds as well. "With married people," 
he says, "the men tend to separate toward one end of the room and the women go 
to the other. But where is it written in the Bible that only women should talk 
about children? If you make a subject larger and give it a theme, everyone can 
join in." 
</P>
<P>
Listening, Stein says, is the other main conversational skill: "You have to 
make people believe that you are listening. Eye contact is indispensable. There 
is nothing more devastating to the person who's speaking to you than to see 
your eyes moving around. 
</P>
<P>
"And react to some of the things they're saying, so they can feel you really 
heard what they said." 
</P>
<P>
When you are ready to end the conversation and your partner is not, it can be 
awkward. "When you feel like you've just got to get away, you can," Stein says. 
"And you don't have to hurt anybody. Everybody out there is hurt enough as it 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"Just say, 'Would you mind terribly if I went to the sandbox?' Now who's going 
to object to that? 
</P>
<P>
"Or say, 'I've enjoyed our chat. Would you mind? I see some friends over there 
I need to talk with, and I fear that they may be leaving early tonight.' Then 
you can end the conversation, and the person doesn't have to feel rejected."

JOSEPH N. BELL: CONTROVERSY CAN'T COMPETE WITH LIFE'S DAILY DRAMA IN DRAWING 
READER RESPONSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Funny, the columns that draw mail. I always expect reaction from columns that 
deal with controversial subjects, but I get much more from columns that deal 
with mundane matters, the stuff of coping with the minutiae of everyday life 
and feeding our souls. Two recent cases in point: a column about a box of 
theater playbills I've collected over the years and one about our dachshund 
puppy. 
</P>
<P>
I received in the mail last week a red, dog-eared notebook with "Plays and 
Players" embossed on the cover. Inside was a marvelous collection of theater 
programs dating from 1911 and including such jewels as Lillian Russell in "The 
First Night"; Lew Fields, Vernon Castle and Blossom Seeley in a musical called 
"The Hen-Pecks" ("Rhymes by E. Ray Goetz and Notes by A. Baldwin Sloane"); 
George Arliss in "Disraeli"; Ethel Barrymore in J.M. Barrie's "Alice 
Sit-by-the-Fire"; "The Ziegfeld Follies of 1911" with Leon Errol, Fanny Brice 
and Bert Williams; and Eddie Foy in "Over the River." 
</P>
<P>
Wedged in the back of this remarkable collection were several programs 
featuring the woman who sent me this notebook: Aloha Baker of Newport Beach, 
the first woman to drive a car around the world. She did it in 1923 -- when 
there were no roads to speak of -- accompanied by a Polish adventurer who 
adopted the name of Capt. Walter Wanderwell. When he died, Aloha married an 
American named Walter Baker and continued her adventures, filming them and 
spending about half her time on the lecture circuit where she was billed as 
"The World's Most Traveled Girl and Famous Hollywood Personality." She is at 
present polishing an autobiography with the help of former Times staffers Vi 
and Don Smith. 
</P>
<P>
From Nancy Ebsen of Balboa Island came a set of playbills that date to 1924 and 
include the Marx Brothers in a confection called "I'll Say She Is," Leslie 
Howard in "The Werewolf," and Ruth Chatterton in a musical called "The Magnolia 
Lady." 
</P>
<P>
Writes Ebsen: "I, too, have all my playbills going back to the '30s and '40s, 
and I saw most of the same musicals you did -- plus sitting with Oscar 
Hammerstein while he directed a performance of 'Showboat' as a tribute to Larry 
Hart after he dropped dead on the streets of New York. And I saw the first 
out-of-town tryout of 'South Pacific' in New Haven, when Mary Martin 
cartwheeled into the bass drum after singing 'I'm in Love With a Wonderful 
Guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another playbill response came from Cynthia Schein, who took exception to my 
comment that no one ever revives "Fiorello." Said Schein proudly, a group of 
seventh- through 12th-graders, under professional direction, will present 
"Fiorello" on behalf of the Long Beach Jewish Community Center July 27 through 
30. "Tickets," notes Schein, "are reasonably priced." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the mail about our dachshund chided me gently for expecting too much of 
her in her puppy phase and wishing I had a more imposing dog to show off. 
Shirley McFall of Huntington Beach, who has two miniature dachshunds, assured 
me that "it's not the size of the dog that counts. There is a very large, 
muscular, body-builder type of man in Newport Beach whom I see frequently on my 
way to work walking a Chihuahua. You tell him he's not masculine!" Then she 
added: "One of the nicest things about dachshunds is that they bond very 
intensely to their humans; more so, in general, than the good ol' dogs." 
</P>
<P>
And Mary Lagerquist of Dana Point also assured me that Coco -- except for her 
name, of which, incidentally, I disapproved from the beginning -- "is quite 
normal and very typical, as any dachshund fancier will attest. Our dachshund 
chewed through two redwood gates, and when my husband put a metal plate across 
the bottom, he chewed through that, too. . . . We got up one Halloween morning 
and found that he had gotten into the trick-or-treat candy I had put by the 
front door ready for action and consumed 23 of the 36 Snickers bars, wrappers 
and all, resulting in one very sick dog." 
</P>
<P>
I suspect it was the candy and not the wrappers that made him sick. Coco eats 
wrappers of all kinds with considerable relish -- and with no apparent damage 
to her health. I was hoping she would grow out of that habit, but it appears a 
considerable strain of billy goat has been bred into these creatures. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the mail relates to puppies and playbills. Francis Raymond Line -- a 
Capistrano Beach octogenarian who celebrates his wedding anniversary each year 
by hiking down into the Grand Canyon with his wife, Helen -- picked up on a 
column I wrote about an Irvine man celebrating his 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mature men and women," wrote Line, "are of special interest to me right now 
because of a new book I'm working on that I hope will be out by autumn." The 
book is entitled "Super Seniors: Their Stories and Secrets" -- and if the 
contents are as inspiring as Francis Line's own story, it should make for good 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
A column on actress Rita Hayworth turned up former motion picture and TV 
director Dick Pettit, now retired in Laguna Beach. Pettit shared some of his 
own recollections of Hayworth's last years, adding that although he and his 
wife were "only casual acquaintances (of Hayworth), we can vouch that she was 
an extremely sweet and charming person (who) could be taken advantage of -- and 
certainly was." 
</P>
<P>
A call in this column for readers to share their outrages got a disappointing 
response as far as numbers go. Maybe Orange County residents are feeling too 
comfortable to be outraged. At any rate, Bud and Irmeli Desenberg wrote that it 
took them almost as long to get from Pacific Coast Highway to their home on I 
Street as it took to get from Los Angeles to Newport Beach on a recent Friday 
night because of the cruisers, whose activities they find outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hull of Costa Mesa -- in splendid form -- sent me three pages of outrages 
including: inefficient use of gas tax money, especially for public 
transportation; the delay in implementing Proposition 103; the aggressiveness 
of state, county and city police in violating individual rights; the recent 
arrest of Fountain Valley Mayor Fred Voss; and "my greatest outrage is still 
reserved for the loss of privacy engendered by the increasing use of Social 
Security numbers by government and business to monitor the behavior and 
transactions of U.S. citizens." 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. -- upset 
because I "vilified Proposition 13" -- wrote that he feels considerable outrage 
over "sanctimonious newspaper columnists judging the morals of the people." 
</P>
<P>
I was questioning judgment, not morals -- but what what the hell, you can't win 
'em all.

In an article in The Times on June 6, the Associated Press incorrectly reported 
that Nicaragua supported the military crackdown in Beijing. Nicaragua's 
official newspaper Barricada cited Chinese leaders' claims that the attack 
avoided chaos and greater bloodshed, but the newspaper did not express support. 
On June 9, President Daniel Ortega said Nicaragua "cannot applaud the violence 
in Asian countries such as China or against the Palestinian or South African 
people."

TRIAL PITTING IRVINE CO., HEIR ENTERS ITS FINAL TWO DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Nearly two years after it started, the Irvine Co.'s suit against Joan Irvine 
Smith entered its final two days, as company lawyers argued Wednesday that 
Smith be paid far less than the $500 million she wants for her stock in the 
giant land development company. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, which pits two of the nation's wealthiest people against each other, 
has run intermittently since August, 1987. Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren 
contends that Smith should receive $88 million from the 1983 deal in which he 
bought most of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
In its suit, the Irvine Co. has asked a Michigan state court referee to 
determine what was the true value of the company in 1983, for purposes of 
determining what Smith's shares are worth. The company is incorporated in 
Michigan. The amounts involved make this one of the largest such cases on 
record, Irvine Co. lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who did not testify during the trial, also did not attend Wednesday's 
final oral arguments, which were held in the law offices of referee Robert B. 
Webster, a retired Michigan judge. 
</P>
<P>
After the trial adjourned Wednesday, Bren said the company had budgeted $114 
million -- the amount he originally offered to Smith, plus an unspecified 
amount of interest -- in the event that Webster rules against the company. 
</P>
<P>
A higher award, he said, could affect the company's ambitious development 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent we have to slow down, the community would feel it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, during the trial Wednesday, one of Bren's attorneys phrased the same 
argument more dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Half a billion dollars, attorney William Campbell said, "would literally bleed 
this company dry." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't pay these people with Monopoly money," Campbell said. "These dollars 
are going to impact the economy of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is the granddaughter of the company's founder, James Irvine II. She 
alleges that Bren fomented discord among Irvine Co. stockholders in the early 
1980s, part of a purported scheme to buy a majority of the stock for far less 
than its worth. At the time, Bren was the company's largest stockholder, with 
34%. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to the $88-million settlement Bren proposed in 1983, he has 
offered to double Smith's 11% stake in the company, to 22.8%. But Smith and her 
mother and fellow shareholder, Athalie Clarke, objected to the $560 million in 
debt Bren loaded onto the company's books to buy out other shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Bren's attorneys insist that either alternative is a good deal and that Smith 
has harmed her interests by rejecting both offers and fighting Bren in the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
The company has prospered in the last five years as land values jumped in 
booming Orange County. Bren said Wednesday that the company repaid the $560 
million in loans within a year. He would not say how much a 22.8% stake in the 
privately held company -- which zealously guards its finances -- would be worth 
now. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with Smith, most of the other stockholders jumped in 1983 at the 
chance to sell for $200,000 a share the stock they bought for $6,000 in 1977. 
In fact, that is a key part of Bren's case: His attorneys say the company was 
worth exactly what knowledgeable shareholders sold it for in 1983. At $200,000 
a share, the company would have been worth about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's attorneys, however, contend the company's ownership of 68,000 acres 
squarely in the path of Southern California's growth was far more valuable. The 
land is part of several old Spanish land grants bought by the Irvine family in 
the 19th Century. Company holdings make up about a sixth of Orange County. It 
is the largest undeveloped piece of real estate under single ownership in any 
U.S. metropolitan area. The company also owns the Newport Center office and 
shopping complex and the Irvine Spectrum industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's attorneys say the company's holdings should have been shopped around in 
1983 to other buyers to raise the price. Smith says that the actual value of 
the company when Bren bought it was $3 billion and that her 11% of the stock 
was actually worth $330 million, boosted since by interest to $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bren's attorneys insisted Wednesday that those estimates ignored such company 
liabilities as debt and taxes and underestimated such problems as the 
reluctance of local governments to approve the land for development as quickly 
as the company wants. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys spent most of Wednesday trying to persuade the court that Smith's 
estimates are "ridiculous" figures cooked up by hired experts. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge rules for Smith, Bren's attorneys said it would set a new 
precedent in corporate laws concerning the rights of minority shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
A favorable ruling would significantly widen such shareholders' ability to seek 
independent appraisals of their stock by the courts and to hold up sales 
arbitrarily when they are dissatisfied with the price, Bren's attorneys argued. 
</P>
<P>
So a Michigan courtroom would not be tied up, the high-stakes trial has run for 
most of its length in a modest office building in a Detroit suburb. A squad of 
attorneys for both sides faced each other Wednesday across a conference table, 
while another 18 people sat within arm's length in high-backed chairs set 
against the wall. They included Bren, who was flanked by an attorney, a 
consultant and key Irvine Co. executives. He took copious notes on a legal pad. 
</P>
<P>
The trial will resume today, its last day, when Smith's attorneys sum up their 
case. Webster, the referee, would not comment on when he might rule. But 
lawyers said a ruling might not come for months.

L.A. SHERIFF'S DEPUTY ARRESTED FOR 1986 ROBBERY OF MIAMI LAWYER

<P>
A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy was arrested today on a Florida warrant 
charging him and another man with robbing a prominent Miami attorney at 
gunpoint in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives arrested George Markel, 38, an 11-year veteran of the department, at 
his home in Rowland Heights at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida warrant charges that he and William Mentzer robbed Miami attorney 
Frank Rubino of his Rolex watch and his Ferrari in July, 1986. Rubino told 
detectives that the armed robbery occurred after a business meeting he had with 
Larry and Karen DeLayne Jacobs Greenberger, also known as Lanie Jacobs. The 
attorney alleged that prior to the meeting, the Greenbergers used Mentzer and 
Markel to intimidate him into signing over half a partnership in a sport 
fishing boat business, Jones said.

JUSTICES UPHOLD LANDMARK RIGHTS RULING BUT LIMIT IT;

HARASSMENT SUITS MAKE DIFFICULT

<P>
The Supreme Court voted unanimously today to leave intact a historic civil 
rights ruling used to combat discrimination, but at the same time limited its 
scope to make it harder for women and minorities to sue for racial harassment. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, in the most important civil rights case of its term, decided 
against overturning the landmark 1976 ruling that upheld a post-Civil War law 
outlawing racial discrimination in all private contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But in the same ruling the justices split along conservative and liberal lines, 
voting 5 to 4 in holding that the law does not cover racial harassment 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The high court had touched off an uproar last year when it announced it would 
consider reversing the 1976 ruling. That ruling largely settled the debate over 
whether civil rights guarantees enacted after the Civil War protected blacks 
from discrimination by private entities as well as acts by government. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights groups expressed relief that the landmark ruling survived, but 
they charged that a string of recent Supreme Court rulings had severely 
restricted the protections under civil rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
While women and minorities can still sue for racial harassment under the civil 
rights laws adopted in the 1960s and 1970s, these measures do not provide for 
punitive damages and for the broad protections found in the 1866 law. 
</P>
<P>
"This Supreme Court has been a disaster for all those committed to equal 
employment opportunity," civil rights leader Benjamin Hooks said after the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the fourth decision handed down by the Supreme Court this term that 
dealt a setback to civil rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Serious Threat' 
</P>
<P>
"Taken separately, each of these retreats would be a source of genuine concern. 
Together they are a serious threat to the 35 years of progress we have achieved 
toward a better and fairer society," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said. 
</P>
<P>
The court refused to apply the 1976 ruling to racial harassment suits against 
employers for conduct after an employment contract has been entered into. 
</P>
<P>
"Racial harassment relating to the conditions of employment is not actionable 
because (the law) does not apply to conduct which occurs after the formation of 
a contract, " Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said for the court majority. 
</P>
<P>
Justice William J. Brennan, the court's leading liberal and a strong supporter 
of a broad legal interpretation of the civil rights law, issued a blistering 
dissent. 
</P>
<P>
"What the court declines to snatch away with one hand, it takes with the 
other," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Brennan in partial dissent were Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. 
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member conservative majority that voted against applying the 
anti-discrimination law to harassment cases consisted of Kennedy, Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Byron 
R. White. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved a black woman, Brenda Patterson, who sought punitive damages 
from her employer for alleged on-the-job racial harassment at a credit union in 
North Carolina.

GUNMAN KILLS 1 NEAR VAN NUYS BAR

<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and another was wounded by a gunman outside a Van Nuys bar 
after a fight between a man and his girlfriend, Los Angeles police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday near the front door of the 
Leprechaun Irish Pub in the 6500 block of Ventura Canyon Avenue, Detective Don 
Tabak said. The name of the 20-year-old Van Nuys man who was killed has not 
been released. Gary Frakes, 20, of Van Nuys was shot in the leg and was in good 
condition at Valley Presbyterian Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Tabak said that an hour before the shooting, a couple had argued in the bar. 
The man and woman, whose identities were not released, went outside and the 
argument continued. The man left when several other bar patrons went out to 
protect the woman, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the gunman later drove past the bar with at least one other 
man and fired a gun about eight times at the people still standing in front, 
Tabak said. The gunman fled in the car after the shooting. No arrests had been 
made by midday.

President Bush, promising "to stand up for the police officers," formally sent 
Congress a $1.2-billion anti-crime package today proposing tougher sentences 
for gun-related crimes and construction of more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Praising law officers as "domestic freedom fighters," Bush said, "Let's put the 
handcuffs on the criminals, not on the criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bush said a person suspected of a crime "should be treated 
with respect and given his rights or her rights, even though the evidence looks 
overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unveiled a Month Ago 
</P>
<P>
Bush unveiled his anti-crime program a month ago but decided to make a special 
occasion out of the usually routine transmittal of the plan to Congress. He 
flew nearly 1,000 miles to southeast Georgia to sign the draft legislation at 
the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, where agents and police officers 
from 60 agencies and every state are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of several thousand people, mostly students, instructors and their 
families, listened to Bush's speech under a baking sun. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating a warning to criminals that he made earlier this year at the funeral 
of murdered Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Everett Hatcher in New York, 
Bush said, "Better that you had never been born than to attack one of America's 
finest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Central Planks of Program 
</P>
<P>
He was applauded loudly as he outlined three of the central planks of his 
anti-crime platform: doubling to 10 years the mandatory term for use of 
semiautomatic weapons in crimes involving violence or drugs; eliminating 
plea-bargaining for violent federal firearms offenses, and an expanded federal 
death penalty for killers and terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
The most costly part of Bush's plan calls for spending $1 billion for new 
prison construction, in addition to $500 million already earmarked for that 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
He also proposed hiring 825 new federal agents and staff and 1,600 new 
prosecutors and staff.

An explosion ripped through a supertanker in Dubai dry dock today, killing at 
least one man and injuring 14, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still checking the ship to see if there are any other bodies, there is 
still smoke around," a police spokesman, contacted by telephone, said. 
</P>
<P>
Dock sources said earlier some crew members were among the casualties aboard 
the Pakistani-owned vessel, operated by the Hong Kong-based Atlas Shipping 
Management company. The explosion occurred in the pump room of the 231,439-ton 
Bahamas-registered Seiva, one day before the vessel was due to leave dry dock 
after repairs. 
</P>
<P>
A dry-dock worker contacted by telephone said a welding machine could have 
caused the blast.

Mass-mailings by 100 senators during 1987-88 cost taxpayers more than $52.7 
million, the congressional watchdog Common Cause reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The 27 senators seeking reelection last year spent $20.1 million of the total, 
an average of 48 cents per household. The per-household figures compared to an 
average of 31 cents for the 67 senators who were not campaigning for 
reelection, and 15 cents for six senators who retired in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Franked mass-mailings are used for campaign purposes by members of Congress 
and provide incumbents with an unfair and discriminatory advantage over their 
challengers," Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said. "The use of the 
frank for mass-mailings should be eliminated or sharply curtailed."

Speaking out 20 years after his daughter drowned in Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's 
car at Chappaquiddick, the father of Mary Jo Kopechne says she did not die in 
vain because her death "kept the senator from becoming President." 
</P>
<P>
"He was worried about himself, not Mary Jo," Joseph Kopechne said in an 
interview in the July issue of Ladies Home Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Kopechne, 28, died July 19, 1969, when a car driven by Kennedy ran off a 
bridge at night and plunged into a pond on Massachusetts' Chappaquiddick 
Island. She had been a campaign worker for Kennedy's brother, Robert. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he freed himself from the car and tried to rescue his passenger. 
But it took him 10 hours to report the accident. He pleaded guilty to leaving 
the scene of an accident and lost his license for a year. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Miss Kopechne's mother, Gwen Kopechne, 71, said other women 
who attended a party with Kennedy and Miss Kopechne before the accident "were 
shut up." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there was a big cover-up and that everybody was paid off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kopechnes received a settlement of $140,904, of which $90,904 came from the 
senator and $50,000 from his insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had two brief meetings with Kennedy after the accident, Mrs. 
Kopechne said. "I don't think he seemed upset either time we saw him," she 
said, "and I don't remember him saying he was sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy has expressed regret for Miss Kopechne's death on numerous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kopechne said Kennedy has telephoned the couple periodically.

HOUSE DEFEATS BID TO BLUNT S&amp;L REFORM

<P>
The House today defeated an attempt to blunt the key reform in savings and loan 
bailout legislation after President Bush threatened to veto a watered-down 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 326 to 94, with 114 Republicans and 212 Democrats supporting the 
President. Fifty-six Republicans and 38 Democrats opted to support the S&amp;L 
industry on the heavily lobbied issue of capital. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is insisting that the government force S&amp;Ls to back their lending with 
more of their own capital. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) tried unsuccessfully to provide an exemption for 
S&amp;Ls that previously received an accounting break, known as "supervisory 
good will," in exchange for taking ailing institutions off the government's 
hands in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accounting Break 
</P>
<P>
The accounting break allows some of the acquiring S&amp;Ls to operate without 
risking any of their owners' money. Hyde's amendment would have permitted 241 
S&amp;Ls that would fail tougher capital standards to appeal administratively 
for an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics complained that the procedure would burden regulators and 
effectively delay Bush's key reform by 18 months for a significant portion of 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a letter to House Republican leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois, made 
it clear that he would veto the S&amp;L bill if it included Hyde's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Giving recognition to good will as capital or creating procedural changes that 
could have the same effect is not justifiable," the President wrote. "Each of 
the amendments to the tough capital standards . . . would render this bill 
unacceptable to me."

Michael Milken, the junk bond king indicted for fraud and racketeering in the 
largest securities crime case ever, said today that he is quitting his job at 
the investment bank and will start his own firm. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, 42, was placed on a forced leave of absence by Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Inc. on March 29, the same day he was indicted by a federal grand jury on 98 
counts of racketeering and securities fraud. He has denied the charges, and his 
trial is expected to be long and complex. 
</P>
<P>
Milken is credited with making billions of dollars for Drexel through his 
pioneering use of junk bonds -- lower-grade securities that offer high yields. 
But he has become a key target in the government's widening case against 
illegal insider trading on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Milken said he will form International Capital Access Group, a consulting firm 
that he said will provide advice to individuals, communities and companies, 
emphasizing opportunities for employees, minorities and unions. 
</P>
<P>
Milken said he was disappointed that he was forced to leave Drexel as part of 
the company's settlement of securities fraud charges with the government.

Unemployment in Britain dropped in May to its lowest level in nearly nine years 
and wage settlements in April outpaced the rate of inflation, the government 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate, regarded as the best indication of the 
underlying trend, fell by 22,800 to just over 1.8 million, or 6.4% of the work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 34th consecutive monthly fall. The number of unemployed is now at 
its lowest since December, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The wage data showed average earnings in April were rising by 9.25% a year, 
well ahead of the annual inflation rate of 8% reported for the month. The 
overall rate of inflation is expected to reach 8.3% when the May figure is 
announced Friday.

A supposedly rare baseball card stolen from a 14-year-old boy who had hoped to 
use it for his college education turned out to be a replica worth $10 at the 
most, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
The stolen card, thought to be a 1910 Honus Wagner tobacco card worth about 
$100,000, lacked the tobacco stamp that would have shown that it was an 
original, said Detective Phil White of the Contra Costa County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who still hasn't recovered the stolen card, was shown a replica 
Tuesday and said it was "exactly the same card stolen from him," White said. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until yesterday we had no way of determining if the card was authentic or a 
replica," White said. "We didn't even know a replica existed, not being 
specialists in that field. We had nothing to compare it with."

<P>
Federation President Yvon Chouinard said a urine sample provided by Karsch at

the anabolic steroid stanozolol, the same muscle-building drug used by sprinter 
Ben Johnson, who was banned for two years after testing positive at the Seoul 
Olympics. 
</P>

Earlier in the day, the Canadian Track and Field Assn. announced that national 
women's hurdles champion Julie Rocheleau-Baumann was suspended after a positive

Three families owning 90% of Gulfstream Park have entered into a non-binding 
letter of intent to sell their shares, the track has announced. 
</P>
<P>
The potential buyer was not named, but newspaper reports today named Calder 
Race Course owner Bertram R. Firestone as the suitor. 
</P>
<P>
If the sale is consummated, Gulfstream would continue as a thoroughbred track, 
said Douglas Donn, president and chief executive officer. There would be no 
operational or personnel changes, and plans for the Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream 
on Nov. 4 would be unaffected, Donn said. 
</P>
<P>
Selling their shares would be members of the Donn family, the Fred Flipse 
family of Miami and the Arthur Appleton family of Ocala.

FIGURE IN JAIL INFORMANT PROBE SENTENCED TO PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Leslie Vernon White, the central figure in an investigation into abuses by 
jailhouse informants was sentenced Wednesday to five years and eight months in 
state prison after pleading guilty to purse snatching and failure to appear in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
White, 31, was a member of a small group of jailhouse informants who regularly 
traded information about other inmates' alleged confessions in return for 
leniency in their own criminal cases. He had been a witness in more than a 
dozen Los Angeles County felony cases, many of them murders. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran informant triggered a major investigation by authorities last fall 
when he demonstrated for sheriff's deputies that he could convincingly 
fabricate a murder confession from an inmate he had never met. White used a 
jail telephone and posed as a bail bondsman, police officer and prosecutor to 
get information about a murder case from law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
White's revelations prompted an investigation by the Los Angeles County Grand 
Jury into the use of jailhouse informants by the district attorney's office. 
The purpose of the review was to determine whether any defendants had been 
wrongly convicted because of bogus informant testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office also imposed tighter restrictions on the use of 
informant testimony by its staff. 
</P>
<P>
White, a convicted kidnaper and car thief, was in jail last fall on a parole 
violation charge stemming from his having snatched an elderly woman's purse 
containing $8 on Wilshire Boulevard in March, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
White bailed out of jail last December when his parole hold expired, but was to 
have returned to court in January for sentencing on his guilty plea to the 
purse-snatching charge. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Ernest M. Hiroshige revoked the guilty plea in 
February over White's objections. Horoshige said that, given White's prior 
convictions for robbery, kidnaping and grand theft -- as well as his failure to 
appear for sentencing in the purse-snatching case last Jan. 19 -- he deserved 
more than the 16 months in County Jail called for under a plea-bargaining 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
White's case was sent back to Municipal Court, where he was ordered to stand 
trial in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
His trial for purse snatching was scheduled to begin Wednesday, but White 
instead pleaded guilty ton one count each of grand theft and failing to appear 
for sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
In his plea, White agreed to be sentenced to five years and eight months in 
state prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lawrence M. Longo said. He was sentenced by 
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner.
