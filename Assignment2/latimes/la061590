S.D. TO GET HOCKEY TEAM; SOCKERS OWNER CONCERNED

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A professional hockey franchise will play in the San Diego Sports Arena this 
fall, it was announced Thursday, and the owner of the Sockers said the move may 
endanger the future of his championship soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Cooper, leaseholder of the Sports Arena, and representatives of the 
International Hockey League announced that San Diego has been awarded an 
expansion franchise that will schedule 41 dates at the arena for the next 
season beginning in October. Cooper posted a $2-million letter of credit when 
his application was approved. 
</P>
<P>
The IHL is considered the top minor league system for the National Hockey 
League. Cooper, who hopes to eventually land an NHL team for an arena he wants 
to build on property he owns in Sorrento Hills, views this award as a 
steppingstone. The IHL team will start as an independent franchise, but Cooper 
said he will attempt to establish a link to an NHL team before the 1991-92 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Fowler, owner of the Sockers for the past three seasons, said he will 
attempt to meet with Cooper and Vin Ciruzzi, president of the Sports Arena, and 
request that they consider starting with hockey in 1991 rather than this fall. 
But Cooper said Thursday that the hockey team will definitely play here this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said he wasn't notified of the possibility of an IHL franchise coming to 
San Diego until late Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I resent the way it's been handled," he said. "If they were going to do this, 
I think they should have talked to us about it some time ago." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has had four previous professional hockey teams: the Skyhawks of the 
Pacific Coast Hockey League, the Gulls of the Western Hockey League, the 
Mariners of the World Hockey Assn. and the Hawks of the Pacific Hockey League. 
The Skyhawks played from 1939 to 1947, the Gulls, Mariners and Hawks played in 
succession from 1966 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL is scheduled to award two or three expansion franchises in December. 
Cooper hopes San Diego will be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to send them a message that we're ready for the National Hockey 
League," he said by telephone from Vancouver, British Columbia, where he is 
attending NHL meetings. "I think San Diego is a hockey town. Everywhere I go in 
the past year, so many people are saying that they are hockey fans, and they 
are going to support the effort." 
</P>
<P>
What remains to be seen is whether San Diego can support both hockey and indoor 
soccer. Fowler is concerned that there won't be enough time to make 
arrangements for the Sports Arena to accommodate two professional franchises. 
The season for the Major Indoor Soccer League -- to which the Sockers belong -- 
nearly parallels the IHL's, beginning at the end of October and usually ending 
early in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers clinched their eighth indoor soccer championship in nine years last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think to try to be up and running with a new hockey franchise this year does 
not make a great deal of sense," Fowler said. "I wish they'd gotten the 
franchise and taken a year to put it together. That would have given us a year 
to do things on a realistic, organized basis and probably would have assured 
that we had two teams in the Sports Arena. Given what's happening now, unless 
we're able to work something out that makes sense, I'm not encouraged at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they realize the level of outrage that's going to exist with a 
number of people within the community," he said. "I think they've handled this 
in a very cavalier fashion, and it's inconsistent with the way they've done a 
lot of other things." 
</P>
<P>
Among the problems Fowler wants to address are game scheduling and the sharing 
of both advertising revenues and office space. Cooper, who will work with 
Ciruzzi to form the franchise's principal ownership, said the Sports Arena will 
make every effort to take care of the Sockers, but that those efforts will not 
include a postponement of the IHL's debut here. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine why we should do that," Cooper said. "There's no reason why we 
couldn't start it" this year. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he doesn't think such a start will present any serious operating 
problems for the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be out looking for another franchise if it was going to be at the 
expense of the Sockers," he said. "I'm a soccer fan. I want the team to 
succeed. It's important that we don't bring in one team and get rid of another 
one." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' primary source of advertising revenue is the dasher boards that 
surround the playing area. Cooper said they will be redesigned so they are 
interchangeable, allowing both teams to advertise at full capacity. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cooper, office space at the Sports Arena will be shared, meaning 
the Sockers will have to move some employees elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Switching the playing surface from ice to a soccer field will increase 
maintenance costs but can be done fairly quickly, Cooper said. Insulation will 
be put on top of the ice, then covered by the soccer carpet. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego IHL team is still missing many pieces. Cooper said he hasn't yet 
made final decisions on a coach or a general manager, but he hopes to have them 
in place in time for a scheduled news conference next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Division alignments for the 11-team IHL are expected to be determined today. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he does not yet know what type of attendance will be needed for his 
franchise to break even financially. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE INTERNATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Background: Founded in Windsor, Canada, in 1945, the IHL began with four teams 
and was designed to absorb young players returning from World War II. The 
Detroit Auto Club was the first champion in 1946, winning what still is known 
as the Turner Cup. The league has operated continuously since, but rarely with 
the same teams returning each season; 1965-66 was the first year in which it 
was configured as it had been the previous year, and the league has had a 
different look in 19 out of the past 24 seasons. The 1989-90 champion was the 
Indianapolis Ice. 
</P>
<P>
Affiliations: Most IHL franchises are tied directly to National Hockey League 
teams, with players moving between the two leagues. In 1989-90, two franchises 
-- Fort Wayne (Ind.) and Phoenix -- were independent, each with loose ties to 
several NHL teams. San Diego is expected to operate this way at first. 
</P>
<P>
Season: Teams play from the first week in October into May, with 82 
regular-season games. In 1989-90, eight of the league's nine teams -- four each 
from the West and East divisions -- made the playoffs. Quarterfinals, 
semifinals and finals were decided by best-of-seven-games series. 
</P>
<P>
Teams: Flint (Mich.) Spirits, Ft. Wayne (Ind.) Komets, Indianapolis Ice, 
Kalamazoo (Mich.) Wings, Kansas City Blades, Muskegon (Mich.) Lumberjacks, 
Milwaukee Admirals, Phoenix Roadrunners, Peoria (Ill.) Rivermen, Salt Lake 
Golden Eagles, San Diego. Ft. Wayne is seeking a move to Albany, N.Y.

Signs that summer's almost here: 
</P>
<P>
Two tourists were arrested Thursday after allegedly trying to steal a 16-foot 
catamaran in the surf off Malibu. They had aroused the suspicion of sheriff's 
deputies when they were observed pushing the craft through the surf at about 
1:30 a.m. No getaway was possible for the catamaran burglars inasmuch as the 
craft tipped over and broke a mast. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a forgery suspect tried unsuccessfully to elude Monrovia police the 
other day by hiding in a parked boat. 
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports say that Tom Bradley may or may not run for a sixth term as 
mayor in 1993. But he'll be on the move at Dodger Stadium tonight. As part of 
Think Blue Week, Bradley will sprint onto the field before the game in a Dodger 
uniform. He'll be wearing No. 100, in honor of the Dodgers' centennial, if not 
the Century Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Angelenos are among the nation's slowest walkers and slowest t-a-l-k-e-r-s. And 
L.A. has some of the nation's slowest bank tellers, too. 
</P>
<P>
So says Robert Levine, a psychology professor at Fresno State University, whose 
students sampled the pace of life in 36 cities. 
</P>
<P>
Among downtown pedestrians, tested over a distance of 60 feet, Boston finished 
first while L.A. came in 24th. New York City might have ranked No. 1, Levine 
said, except that on the block where the Big Apple was surveyed, "there was an 
attempted purse-snatching as well as a mugging. And then someone mugged the 
mugger." 
</P>
<P>
In the talking category, clerks in L.A. ranked 35th in words-per-second in 
answering questions. And L.A.'s bank tellers were the slowest at making change, 
possibly owing to the shaky situation of so many financial institutions around 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, whose findings were published in Psychology Today, next plans to 
determine which cities' residents are most helpful in such categories as giving 
a stranger directions and picking up a package dropped by a passer-by. 
</P>
<P>
"Some cities reacted negatively" when they were ranked as slowpokes, Levine 
said, but they shouldn't. After all, L.A. also ranked 28th in heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
For L.A.'s not-so-laid-back folks -- for instance, bank tellers whose bosses 
read about the above survey -- the summer catalogue of posh Hammacher Schlemmer 
offers the "Stress-Relieving Facial Mask" for $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills shop says, for best results, "refrigerate the mask before 
use." 
</P>
<P>
Also ideal for hockey goalies.

U.S. ADMINISTRATION'S THREAT TO CUT OFF TALKS WITH ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At last, in your editorial, you seem to be coming to grips with the thought 
that there may be no justification for the United States to continue 
negotiating with the PLO. If Yasser Arafat does control the terrorist 
organization and its affiliates, then he is responsible for the recent attack 
by the Palestine Liberation Front, one of the PLO's affiliates, on the Israeli 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
If he cannot control these territories, there is no purpose in negotiating with 
him because he will not be able to enforce any commitment he may make. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat insists that he did not know about the terrorist operation, but this 
hardly seems possible since the planning and training for it went on, according 
to Abul Abbas, the terrorist leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front, for 
two full years. This is unbelievable. In any event, the goal of the raid, 
according to one of the captured terrorists, was "to kill civilians in the 
(Sheraton) hotel area of Tel Aviv. . . . We were supposed to land and kill 
anyone we came across." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has already supplied our State Department with 
documented evidence about more than a thousand terrorist attacks against Israel 
since Arafat's pledge in December, 1988, that the PLO was ending such attacks. 
Should it not be clear by now, even to Secretary of State James Baker, that 
Arafat is an unconscionable liar and cannot be considered a credible 
negotiating partner? 
</P>
<P>
You say that whether the acts of the PLO "justify an end to the U.S. dialogue 
with the PLO remains to be determined." But every relevant fact indicates that 
the terrorist PLO has not given up its aim of destroying Israel. Isn't that the 
bottom line?

COUNTY REDISTRICTING DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With respect to your latest editorial on redistricting, it needs to be pointed 
out that Judge Kenyon has no right to be out of patience with the Board of 
Supervisors. It was the Department of Justice and the ACLU that waited seven 
years before filing the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
It was Judge Kenyon himself who declared that the trial would be over in 
February and then let the case drag on until June. 
</P>
<P>
It is absurd and unfair for the judge now to order the county to submit a 
redistricting plan within 20 days. This allows no time for public hearings to 
be held and effectively shuts off citizen participation in redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Common sense would allow Sarah Flores and Greg O'Brian the right to run in 
November (for a seat on the board), and the board to reapportion using the 1990 
census figures, not antiquated projections.

NO FURTHER DELAY, PLEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon will hear arguments today on a request that 
he stay his order directing the L.A. County Board of Supervisors to present him 
with a legally acceptable redistricting plan by June 27. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon issued the order following a lengthy trial in which the board's five 
members were found to have conspired to maintain themselves in office by 
denying the county's 2 million Latinos the voting rights to which they are 
legally entitled. Now the board's majority -- which already has enjoyed nine 
years in power on the basis of an electoral system that has been found illegal 
-- wants the judge to postpone the June deadline so that it can pursue an 
immediate appeal. It is worth noting in this context that, over the past two 
years, the supervisors, who repeatedly have claimed the county is unable to 
adequately fund many essential human services, have spent $4 million in legal 
fees defending their indefensible and self-interested affront to this basic 
civil right. (If Kenyon awards legal fees to the plaintiffs, the county will be 
liable for an additional $2 million in costs.) 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the plaintiffs are opposed to further delay and to the board's 
additional request that Kenyon allow the November election between Sarah Flores 
and Judge Gregory O'Brien, even though the boundaries of the 1st District seat 
they are contesting have been judged to have been illegally drawn. The latter 
issue is a knotty one, fraught with the often conflicting considerations that 
arise when the willful misconduct of one co-equal branch of government forces 
another to intervene in its affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Since passage of the Voting Rights Act, federal judges have generally conducted 
such intervention with an integrity and tact that has vindicated the public's 
faith in the judiciary as the ultimate guardian of its constitutional rights. 
Judge Kenyon's conduct of this case stands squarely in that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The district boundaries the supervisors illegally drew for themselves in 1981 
are more than lines on a map. They are a web of deceit and discrimination. 
Every day they are allowed to remain in place is another day of disgrace.

BAKER: CALL US IF YOU'RE SERIOUS; 
</P>
<P>
* EXASPERATION UNDERSCORES DETERIORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's getting to be a habit. Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir speaks his 
mind, has his words quoted in the press, sees them provoke a national and 
international furor. And then he instructs his spokesman to say that it was all 
a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
It happened in January, when Shamir spoke publicly about the need for a "Big 
Israel" to absorb hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jewish immigrants. That 
description was widely interpreted as emphasizing Shamir's commitment -- which 
he has never tried to hide -- to perpetual Israeli control over the West Bank, 
a position that is the antithesis of good-faith negotiations toward 
accommodation with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
And it happened again this week. In a newspaper interview, Shamir posed 
unhelpful new terms for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, specifically demanding 
advance agreement that there could be only limited autonomy for the Arab 
populace of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Shamir's condition provoked an 
exasperated Secretary of State James A. Baker III to use some of the bluntest 
language a U.S. official has directed at Israel since the Suez crisis of 1956. 
</P>
<P>
The response from Shamir's office, once again, was to deny that the premier had 
spoken the words attributed to him. That denial isn't plausible. The Shamir 
interview appeared in the English-language Jerusalem Post, which under its new 
owners has become a strong and knowing supporter of Shamir's policies. 
Moreover, the gist of Shamir's remarks was fully consistent both with the 
longstanding expansionist ideology of his Likud Party and with the hard-line 
sentiments of his new multi-party coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post comments may have been the last straw for the Bush 
Administration. In testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Baker 
made no effort to hide his frustration. Clearly the Administration feels it has 
been misled by Shamir as it has worked to get Israeli-Palestinian talks 
started. If Shamir's conditional approach to negotiations prevails, "there 
won't be any dialogue and there won't be any peace," Baker said. He told the 
committee that "we got extraordinarily close" to agreement for direct 
Israeli-Palestinian talks earlier this year, only to run into stonewall 
resistance from Shamir. Then came Baker's blunt but unmistakable message to 
Israel: "When you're serious about peace, call us." 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday the White House and the State Department tried to put the best 
possible face on Baker's comments, suggesting that they were aimed at both 
sides in the controversy. No doubt they were. But there can be no doubt either, 
from the context of Baker's remarks, that Washington holds Israel chiefly to 
blame for the continuing deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
It's out in the open now, and there's no way to plead misunderstanding about 
what's been said.

FROM INVINCIBILITY TO REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marion Barry, the embattled mayor of the nation's capital, is no longer running 
for reelection. As his trial on cocaine and perjury charges gets under way, he 
has abandoned his bid for a fourth term. With that step, he has acknowledged 
his responsibilities to his constituents and to the city. It's about time. 
</P>
<P>
He is innocent unless proven guilty of the charges that he has used illegal 
drugs, including crack cocaine. But the accusations jeopardize his ability to 
govern in a city ravaged by drug wars and shamed by the highest homicide rate 
per capita in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Those accusations also jeopardized his reelection. Yet, as many as a quarter of 
the district's voters remained loyal, according to a poll. His followers 
remembered the halcyon days of Barry's first term when he worked to revitalize 
downtown, improve services, and create jobs and opportunities for minority 
contractors. Under his leadership, African-Americans became major players in a 
city that Congress had treated like a plantation. 
</P>
<P>
His current plight prompts an ambivalence for many black Americans who believe 
their leaders and, closer to home, their parents, friends or even they have 
been singled out for unfair treatment at the hands of whites -- in this case, a 
Republican prosecutor and the white-owned media. 
</P>
<P>
Race, politics or the lure of convicting a sitting mayor may or may not have 
boosted the fervor in the zealous prosecution. Barry, however, certainly did 
himself no favors. 
</P>
<P>
Flamboyant and defiant, he courted trouble. Too often he carried himself with 
neither the dignity nor authority of his position. He invited scrutiny as did 
Gary Hart, the former presidential candidate who dared the media to catch him 
in his folly. As the rumors swelled and the authorities closed in, Barry 
repeated his denials to The Times. He was, in his own words, "invincible." 
</P>
<P>
As jury selection continues in his trial, Barry is no longer invincible. He is 
no longer arrogant, above the law or the public trust. He is repentant and 
ready to let the healing begin for himself and for Washington, D. C.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: HILL WORKS HARDER, KEEPS THE FAITH AND REBOUNDS IN

In an era when off-beat comedy and gimmicks seem to dominate local sportscasts, 
Jim Hill has shown there still is room for those who play it straight. 
</P>
<P>
The last couple of years, it appeared that Hill had been victimized by the 
trend toward shtick. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who went from Channel 2 to Channel 7 in 1987, also went from No. 1 in the 
local ratings to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
But he has made a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nielsen ratings from the May sweeps period, Hill has caught 
Channel 2's Keith Olbermann and narrowed the gap on Channel 4's Fred Roggin. 
</P>
<P>
And the ratings for Channel 7's 5 and 6 o'clock news, with Hill, fared better 
against the competition -- placing first and second, respectively -- than the 
station's 11 o'clock news, without Hill.

Channel 7's 11 o'clock news finished behind Channel 4's news and Channel 5's 
"Cheers" reruns. 
</P>
<P>
Besides making a comeback in the ratings, Hill has also battled back from 
criticism here and elsewhere, and from a rough go at the ABC network level. 
</P>
<P>
"I just started working harder," he said the other night. "Some people might 
have said, 'To heck with it,' and worked less. But that's not me. I don't give 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Working harder didn't mean just putting in more time. Hill has always put in a 
lot of hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I began spending more time evaluating how I did things," he said. "I put more 
thought into it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, his shows are crisper, the live interviews shorter and more pertinent. 
</P>
<P>
There were also accusations that Hill, despite good intentions, had failed to 
fulfill certain community commitments. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever accused Hill of not being community minded. The criticism was that 
he didn't do everything he said he would do. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had trouble saying no," he said. "I would tell people, 'Sure, I'd 
like to do that.' They'd take that as a yes. 
</P>
<P>
"After (the criticism), friends offered a lot of advice. I'd always been good 
at giving advice, but not so good at taking it. But I started listening." 
</P>
<P>
One of those friends was Alescia Buford, the wife of former Baltimore Oriole 
Don Buford who has a public relations business in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"What Alescia told me was, 'You need someone like me to handle your 
public-service activities.' She was right. Now she takes care of those things, 
and she's been great." 
</P>
<P>
Said Buford: "He really does do a lot, maybe two or three things a week. One 
day he did a parade in the morning, a lunch, then a dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Buford said he not only donates time, but money, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has worked out very well," she said. "We got him to get a fax 
machine, and we stay on him." 
</P>
<P>
Hill said he often visits schools in central Los Angeles to talk with kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize I can be a role model," he said. "I can show them that, hey, I got 
out and made it, so can they. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll tell teachers to leave the auditorium, and I'll get down and 
talk their talk. That's one way to reach these kids. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them aren't bad kids. They just want a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Hill bought a table at a Magic Johnson dinner at the Century 
Plaza Hotel and invited a couple of members of the Crips and another couple 
from the Bloods. 
</P>
<P>
"Those kids sat together and had the time of their life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such things make Hill an optimist. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think there is hope," he said. "What these kids need more than 
anything else is jobs. They want nice things, that's all. If selling drugs is 
the only way they can get them, that's the route they go." 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who came from a black, segregated area of south San Antonio, said a 
turning point in his life occurred when he was a teen-ager and an insurance man 
came to his family's house to collect a bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't very much, but the man started yelling at my mother, saying, 'That's 
just the way you people are.' Only he didn't use the world people. He used that 
other word. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into the kitchen and got a butcher knife. I wanted to kill the man. My 
mother stopped me. 
</P>
<P>
"Afterward, she said, 'Jim, you're going to have to leave this place. You're 
going to have to get out of here and go to college.' 
</P>
<P>
"She was right. I had to get out of there. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't gotten a football scholarship (to Texas A&amp;I), I could very 
easily have ended up in jail -- or dead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Hill has found out, just going from torn pants and worn sneakers to tailored 
suits and custom-made footwear doesn't mean that life will forever be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Hill went through a failed marriage to actress Denise Nicholas in the early 
'80s, and went through his career problems in the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
He said, though, that he has always tried to think positively, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"I'd kept telling myself, 'You're the luckiest guy in the world with the 
greatest job in the world.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were times when he would get down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd call up Ed Hookstratten (his agent) to complain, and he'd say, 'Will you 
shut up and get back to work. If you work hard, everything will work out.' Then 
he'd hang up. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best advice anyone could have given me." 
</P>
<P>
Hill's up-and-down journey through life hits another high point Saturday night. 
He will be presented an award as sports journalist of the year at the 
Cedars-Sinai Sports Spectacular Dinner at the Century Plaza. Among the previous 
winners were Vin Scully, Dick Enberg and Jim Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"When they first told me about it, I thought, 'OK, who turned you down?' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dodger broadcaster Don Drysdale will be among those honored at the Cedars-Sinai 
dinner Saturday night. He will receive a lifetime achievement award. Proceeds 
from the dinner and a sports memorabilia auction will benefit the Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Genetics-Birth Defects Center. For information, call (213) 855-3664.

Baseball on CBS resumes this Saturday, with the Dodgers' game against San Diego 
one of the split-national telecasts. Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat will be the 
announcers for the 12:15 p.m. telecast. . . . Oops Dept.: ESPN's Bob Ley 
reported Monday night that Mike Gallego had broken up Nolan Ryan's no-hitter in 
the sixth inning. The error was later corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Doucette is expected to be named to fill in for Ram radio announcer Bob 
Starr, who will miss the four exhibition games plus the first three 
regular-season games. Starr is in his first year as a TV announcer for the 
Boston Red Sox. "Nothing's been finalized," KMPC General Manager Bill Ward 
said. Also, Ward said, it appears Jack Youngblood will return as the 
commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Ratings game: The U.S.-Czechoslovakia World Cup game on TNT last Sunday got an 
overnight rating of 1.8 and a 6% share of the audience. Meanwhile, Saturday's 
game between Italy and Austria got a 24% share in Italy. . . . The French Open 
final on NBC drew a 3.5 overnight rating, the NBA finals on CBS an 11.7. 
</P>
<P>
It's unclear whether Vic (the Brick) Jacobs, fired this week by Channel 13, is 
headed to KIIS-FM. Jacobs declined to say for sure, and calls to the station's 
general manager and program director were not returned. One source said that 
Jacobs was all set to go to KIIS as an eventual replacement for Charleye Wright 
on Rick Dees' show, but station management was under the impression it was 
getting a television personality, not a former TV personality. Jacobs will be 
gone from Channel 13 at the end of the month.

FIELDER GETS ANOTHER GOOD PITCH TO DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Good hitters usually hit good pitches and Detroit's Cecil Fielder is proving to 
be one of the best hitters in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder continued to produce against Cleveland pitching as he hit a 
tiebreaking, two-run homer in the fifth inning that gave the Tigers a 7-3 
victory over the Indians at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The homer, on a 1-1 count, came on a forkball from Sergio Valdez that broke 
down and probably out of the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit a very good pitch," Cleveland Manager John McNamara said. "You talk to 
other people for advice and we try to pitch him with a lot of care. But he's 
hitting other people, too. That pitch might have been out of the strike zone. 
He just goes down and gets it." 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who is 12 for 23 against Cleveland, broke a 3-3 tie with his major 
league-leading 24th homer with two out and Tony Phillips on first with a walk. 
He also leads the majors with 59 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder has five home runs -- three in one game -- and 11 RBIs in six games 
against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Oakland 2 -- The White Sox climbed to within a game of the 
first-place Athletics in the West by beating Dave Stewart at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The game was the first of the season between the teams with the best records in 
the league. The Athletics are 39-20; the White Sox 37-20. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox have won six of their last seven and 14 of 19. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, Boston 1 -- Chuck Cary, who yielded six runs in two-thirds of an 
inning Saturday, held the Red Sox to four hits and a run in seven innings at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 1-1, Jesse Barfield led of the seventh with a double, took 
third on Mel Hall's groundout and scored on a wild pitch. The Yankees scored 
another run on a single by Jim Leyritz and Bob Geren's double. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, Minnesota 1 -- Pat Borders hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the 
sixth inning at Minneapolis to help Dave Stieb win his fourth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Twins' seventh consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb (9-2) yielded only five hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 8, Baltimore 5 -- The Brewers blew a four-run lead, then defeated the 
Orioles on Robin Yount's tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the seventh inning and a 
ninth-inning single by Gary Sheffield, who also stole home. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 5, Texas 4 -- Jeffrey Leonard's two-out single capped a three-run ninth 
inning as the Mariners rallied at Seattle.

PADRES LOSE MORE THAN THREE GAMES TO GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants are on the road to recovery and the San Diego Padres 
hope that All-Star catcher Benito Santiago will take the same route. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell doubled twice and drove in three runs as the Giants beat the 
Padres, 6-2, Thursday to sweep the three-game series at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also lost Santiago, who sustained a broken left forearm when he was 
hit by a pitch. He is expected to be out six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have won 14 of their last 15, including a 6-1 road trip, and trail 
second-place San Diego by one-half game in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a combination of everything," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. "We 
hit the ball. We had great defense and we got some good clutch pitching. Things 
are starting to go good for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants outscored the Padres, 19-4, in the series, cooling off a club that 
had won seven of its first 10 games on a now-concluded 13-game home stand. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell hit doubles in the seventh and eighth innings to drive in three 
runs. He's hitting .309 with 36 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"We never lost confidence in ourselves," said Mitchell about a team that played 
8-12 ball for the month of April and lost its first eight home games. "We knew 
things were going to turn around for us. All we had to do was just get it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will have to do the same without Santiago, who was batting .317 with 
nine homers and 33 RBIs. He was injured when he was hit by a pitch from Jeff 
Brantley while pinch-hitting in the seventh inning. He was put on the 21-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 4, Atlanta 3 -- Barry Larkin singled home Paul O'Neill with two out 
in the ninth inning at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill drew a two-out walk from Joe Boever (1-3) and took third on Billy 
Hatcher's single to left, his fourth hit of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds took a 3-2 lead into the ninth, but Rob Dibble (4-1) gave up the tying 
run as Dale Murphy, who had only two hits in 15 at-bats in the series, singled 
home Ron Gant. Dibble has blown five of his 11 save opportunities this season. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the game was delayed 43 minutes by rain, and a shower brought 
another 34-minute delay after Hatcher led off the bottom of the first inning 
with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, St. Louis 2 -- Mike Fitzgerald singled home the tying run with two 
out in the top of the ninth inning, and Tim Raines drew a bases-loaded walk 
from Ken Dayley to force home the go-ahead run at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Niedenfuer (0-2) relieved starter Bryn Smith to start the ninth with a 2-1 
lead. Larry Walker led off with a single and, with one out, Spike Owen walked. 
</P>
<P>
Dayley relieved and Fitzgerald, batting for Delino DeShields, singled on a 1-2 
pitch. After a wild pitch and a walk to Dave Martinez, Raines walked on a full 
count.

NEUMANN SHOOTS A 66 AND LEADS BY ONE SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Liselotte Neumann rebounded from a season-long slump to shoot a four-under-par 
66 Thursday and take a one-stroke lead over defending champion Nancy Lopez and 
Dale Eggeling after the first round of a $300,000 LPGA tournament at Somers 
Point, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
All three are looking to end lengthy victory droughts. 
</P>
<P>
Neumann, of Sweden, has not won since the 1988 U.S. Women's Open, her only LPGA 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Eggeling scored her only tour victory in 1980, and Lopez has not won since last 
year, a major slump for the Hall of Famer, who has won 42 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about today," Lopez said after matching her best score this year. 
She did it with four birdies and a bogey on the par-70, 6,015-yard Sands 
Country Club course. "I played well and held onto it. It's one of the best 
starts I've had in the last few tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
Neumann missed cuts in the last two tournaments and has finished no higher than 
seventh this year, but she birdied three of the first four holes Thursday and 
had seven birdies and three bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Hartmann, inspired by a practice round with tennis star Ivan Lendl, took a 
share of the first-round lead in a PGA European Tour stop at Rickmansworth, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Hartmann, from Osprey, Fla., was among four golfers who shot six-under par 66s 
over the 6,855-yard Moor Park Golf Club course. Tied with him were Sam Torrance 
of Scotland and Peter Mitchell and Andrew Sherborne of England. 
</P>
<P>
Hartmann credited his putting for his solid round and a game with Lendl on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Lendl was a golf nut, but he is also a great competitor," Hartmann 
said. "He played nine and beat me 1-up. He also won $5 and seemed very pleased 
about that, but I guess he needs the money."

TRIALS OF RECYCLING NOT TOO MUCH TO BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "The Garbage That Ate Our Lives" (June 11): I find it less than cute and 
close to irresponsible to publish an article on the trials of making 
environmentally sound consumer choices at the market and the difficulties of 
separating recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
Bottom Line: If my 2-year-old can separate the tin from the aluminum and my 
teen-ager can faithfully recycle the same plastic sandwich bag for days at a 
time, then presumably a household of college grads can do their parts as good 
citizens without whining about it.

STANLEY CROUCH'S EAST L.A. COLLEGE ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In The Times' recent piece on the black writer Stanley Crouch he is quoted as 
saying he is "a graduate of no college." I believe that to be true, and I also 
believe it to be true, as the quote implies, that Crouch is largely self-taught 
and has achieved his present eminence in literary circles as a result of his 
own abundant energy and talent. 
</P>
<P>
However, in 1965 and 1966 he completed 29 1/2 units at East Los Angeles 
College, including courses in composition, literature, and creative writing. 
</P>
<P>
Of course I don't now what value he places on those courses, but I do know that 
we in the English Department recognized and nurtured his talent. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1965 edition of the college literary magazine, Milestone, we published 
14 pages of Crouch's poetry, citing him for "consistently high quality in his 
portfolio of poems." This had never been done before and has not since. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stanley won first and second prize for poetry in our then 
semi-annual writing contest and wrote the introduction to that edition of 
Milestone, a still-impressive and lovely affirmation of the artist's role in 
contemporary society.

ISRAEL HOMELAND FOR SOVIET JEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Jews should not be sending enormous sums of money to finance Russian 
Jews and encourage them to move to Israel ("Homeward Bound," June 11). 
</P>
<P>
These people have homes in a country that lost over 20 million of its people 
fighting the Nazis. American Jews should be using their influence and money to 
persuade Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians who are really in need of a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
There will never be peace in the Middle East until all people from that area 
have a homeland.

'THOSE WHO CAN'T' VS. THOSE WHO KAHN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Alice Kahn's misinformed, vicious, morally offensive attack on scientific 
research ("Linking Sex and Oat Bran: That's Science," June 3): She writes, 
"Those who can, do; those who can't, teach; those who can do absolutely 
nothing, do research." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn refers to the information explosion in science as a "glut of hideous 
proportions." 
</P>
<P>
Coming from someone who makes no important distinction between lite ice cream 
and a vaccine for cholera, failure to appreciate the significance of this 
"glut" is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn condemns research on the "obvious." Is it obvious that the Earth is round, 
or that a virus causes polio or that schizophrenia can be managed with drugs 
that block dopamine receptors? Some time ago, it was equally "obvious" that the 
Earth was flat and that polio and schizophrenia resulted from spiritual 
weakness. Scientists do not simply believe the obvious; they do collect data 
that allow them to distinguish the "obvious and correct" from the "obvious but 
wrong." But for the most part, they study phenomena that are not the least bit 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn should do some checking on how easy and lucrative a career in science is 
these days. After 11 years of higher education, I got an excellent job as a 
professor at Occidental College. I teach classes year-round and maintain an 
active research program. I typically work 10 to 12 hours a day, six or seven 
days a week; this work pattern is not unusual at colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
I am not complaining. I chose my work and I love it. My point is that it is 
absurd to characterize an academic career as "doing absolutely nothing" on a 
"free ride." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn should also get in the habit of using non-sexist language, even with 
respect to researchers.

EPHRAIM LONDON; LAWYER SPECIALIZED IN CENSORSHIP CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ephraim London, 78, a lawyer who specialized in constitutional law and 
successfully fought bans against films. London argued nine cases before the 
U.S. Supreme Court and won all of them. 
</P>
<P>
The two that garnered the most attention involved films banned in New York -- 
"The Miracle" in 1950 and "Lady Chatterley's Lover" in 1956. Other films whose 
bans were overturned by the high court after London argued for their showing 
were "The Lovers" in 1964 and "Language of Love" in 1971. London also 
represented authors and entertainers who were threatened with censorship. In 
1964, he represented comedian Lenny Bruce, who had been arrested for allegedly 
using obscene material. Bruce was convicted by a three-judge panel in Manhattan 
but London won a reversal on appeal. He also was Lillian Hellman's attorney in 
her defamation suit against author Mary McCarthy which became moot after 
Hellman's death in 1984. On Tuesday in New York City of the complications of 
diabetes.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
GETTING ON JUVENILE HALL'S CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for Orange County was quick to label a decision Wednesday on the 
treatment of youngsters confined at Juvenile Hall as "a vindication of our 
staff." Not so fast. The judge's decision was sound and sensible, but it was no 
vindication. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Linda H. McLaughlin imposed strict new guidelines on the 
county facility for troubled youngsters. The whole tone of her 49-page decision 
was one of grave concern about past procedures. 
</P>
<P>
It is true McLaughlin did not outlaw putting juveniles who become unmanageable 
in a "rubber room" or tying them down to a bed if their behavior was dangerous 
to themselves or others. But the decision in no way endorsed business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin concluded after five weeks of testimony that the Juvenile Hall staff 
was "not trained or qualified to make the decision to tie down a minor or 
confine a minor to the rubber/safety room." That, she said, could only be done 
by a psychiatrist trained in evaluating the physical and psychological safety 
of the minor. 
</P>
<P>
In a "clear emergency," when one was unavailable, the decision could be made by 
duty officers who had been certified by a psychiatrist as trained and qualified 
to make such a call. McLaughlin also said review policies should be instituted. 
That the county voluntarily agreed in mid-trial to switch to fleece-lined 
leather cuffs for restraints showed it already was getting a message it needed 
to hear. 
</P>
<P>
While Judge McLaughlin's ruling fell short of outlawing tie-downs and rubber 
rooms altogether, it should serve as a sobering reminder they can be used only 
when absolutely necessary and under adequate guidelines and review. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin indicated that she is aware of the potential for violence by these 
very troubled young offenders. But they also must be dealt with humanely. The 
decision introduced important controls, and sent a message that not only must 
the county be on watch, but that the court is on the watch, too.

BELAFONTE TRACES ROOTS OF LATIN MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Far-reaching yet accessible, packed with information and still fun to watch, 
"Routes of Rhythm with Harry Belafonte," takes on the challenging subject of 
tracing the roots of Latin music and its eventual presence in the American 
musical mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
The show is a three-part, three-hour KCET production airing tonight, next 
Friday and June 29 on Channels 28 and 15, 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the show -- produced and directed by Eugene Rosow and Howard 
Dratch -- is suited to its weighty task. 
</P>
<P>
The well-crafted, smoothly moving script, written with authenticity by Linda 
Post, Rosow and Dratch, is delivered with understated panache by a soft-voiced 
Belafonte 
</P>
<P>
The script is interwoven with an amalgam of current and archival film, 
interviews and an array of photographs and artwork that blend into a 
provocative, pleasing whole. 
</P>
<P>
From the popularization of the tango in 1913 by dancers Vernon and Irene Castle 
to the 1980s mix of Latin and pop elements by Gloria Estefan and the Miami 
Sound Machine, the sounds of Latin music have tantalized the ears, feet and 
hearts of listeners in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But, as "Routes of Rhythm" explains, this musical blend goes back more than 500 
years to Africa, where free-flowing rhythms pounded on drums accompanied every 
event in life, and Spain, where what later became known as flamenco was 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
The second and third segments detail the migration of Afro-Cuban music to the 
United States, from Xavier Cugat's mass popularity with the rumba in the '30s 
to Desi Arnaz, who brought Latin sounds to millions via television. 
</P>
<P>
The influence of Afro-Cuban music on jazz is revealed in a profile of Cuban 
drummer Chano Pozo. 
</P>
<P>
"Routes of Rhythm" proves to be a road that, once you get on, you won't want to 
get off.

RUSTIC FOOD MAKES HIP FOODIES SING THE PRAISES OF L'OPERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people look pleased, dressed to the nines and beaming as they wait for the 
parking valets. L'Opera is clearly the hottest thing in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It really is hot. L'Opera has all the Westside Italian accessories, starting 
with suitably grand decor: a shiny display kitchen behind glass walls that 
nearly reach the ceiling, with Ionic columns and even a couple of architraves 
etched on them for fun. There's a hip Italian and California wine list. There's 
good hot focaccia bread as soon as you sit down, along with cruets of olive oil 
and excellent balsamic vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizers include some obligatory twists on classics such as vitello 
salmonato, a variation on the veal dish that traditionally comes in a 
tuna-flavored sauce; salmon as a substitute, though, strikes me as a little too 
loud for this exquisite, thin-sliced veal. 
</P>
<P>
But the appetizers not to miss often sound like cliches. Antipasto misto is the 
usual Italian sausages with sliced mozzarella and pickled vegetables -- but 
what rich-flavored salame and mortadella, what appetizing pickled vegetables! 
What aromatic prosciutto, too (you can also get this imported prosciutto as an 
appetizer by itself, with big delicious chunks of Reggiano Parmesan). You can 
even order prosciutto d'oca: gorgeous, paper-thin slices made from goose, very 
smoky and powerfully flavored, with a generous skirt of fat. 
</P>
<P>
The pastas are decidedly the main attraction. With one exception I know of 
(relatively dull fusilli with broccoli and potatoes), they are stupendous. Take 
the mezzelune aragosta: exquisite flat half-moon pastas with a light, lyrical 
filling of lobster and ricotta, in a fresh tomato sauce with a dash of Marsala. 
There are a lot of lobster-filled pastas around, but this is one of the most 
delicate. 
</P>
<P>
Orecchiette al sugo di castrato are unusual: little coin-shaped pastas in a 
tomato sauce addictively flavored with lamb and rosemary. Fettuccine alla 
norcina sounds pretty straightforward, simply fettuccine in cream tomato sauce 
with spicy sausage. However, while the spice in the sausages turns out to be 
just fennel (to be sure, rather a lot of fennel), the noodles themselves are as 
light as a cloud, rolled almost paper-thin. 
</P>
<P>
The lasagna vegetariana, which sounds like a charitable act rather than a 
treat, happens to be one of the best things here. Dressed with a bit of fresh 
sweet tomato sauce on one side and a sprinkling of parsley on the other to 
represent the Italian flag (that silly though cute custom), the luscious pasta 
is filled with a wonderful concentrated mushroom paste, essentially a French 
duxelles mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a few pastas are staggeringly rich. The plush-textured gnocchi come in 
stupefying mascarpone sauce. Panzerotti are square ravioli filled with duck in 
a sauce of mascarpone and walnuts. A great combination, by the way; why don't 
we have duck with walnuts all the time? 
</P>
<P>
As is often true at Italian restaurants, the meat course tends to be a slight 
letdown following the pastas. Oh, there are some quite good things: a hearty 
roasted free-range chicken with a simple Dijon mustard sauce; a dainty grilled 
chicken breast; the surprising treccia d'agnello, which the menu calls braided 
lamb -- not a misprint for breaded or braised, but long tender pieces of lamb 
braided together and grilled. 
</P>
<P>
But the bistecca fiorentina, sprinkled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar 
though it may be, is only a moderately exciting steak; it may just be cooked 
too slowly for American tastes. The sauce of grapes and brandy on the somewhat 
dry pork noisettes is disappointingly fussy, while a flavorful, tender veal 
chop is treated to a rather vague green olive sauce. The mascarpone sauce on 
the veal scallops is so absurdly rich you can't taste anything. 
</P>
<P>
And there's one entree I positively don't like: the intriguing-sounding trout 
with prosciutto. Despite L'Opera's good prosciutto, this turned out to be a 
rather dry trout with a rather old and funky aroma when I ordered it. 
</P>
<P>
At dessert time, we find a wisecracking mind at work in the pastry kitchen. 
Salame di cioccolata looks like a joke (salame-like brown slices flecked with 
light bits of hazelnut and the occasional raisin) but tastes like the lightest 
and yet most intense of chocolate candies. Sacchetto di cioccolata is a comical 
shopping bag made of chocolate that has evidently fallen over, spilling fruits 
on the plate. In another dessert, a dense chocolate "volcano" is surrounded by 
a lava flow of raspberry syrup spotted with berries. 
</P>
<P>
The dressed-to-the-nines people waiting on this Long Beach sidewalk are beaming 
with good reason. Though I'd often get sidetracked by the pastas and skip the 
entrees, and despite the occasional clinker elsewhere, L'Opera is hot. 
</P>
<P>
 L'Opera Ristorante, 101 Pine Ave., Long Beach, (213) 491-0066. Lunch 11:30 
a.m.-4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, dinner 5-11 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 
5-12 p.m. Friday through Sunday. Full bar. Complimentary valet parking. All

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: ISHI'S SAWTELLE KITCHEN WAS WELL-WORTH THE WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were those who went into foodie mourning when Ishi's Grill, the tiny 
house of excellent Franco-Japanese cuisine, closed its doors more than four 
years ago. Rumors about its chef, Masayuki Ishikawa would surface from time to 
time -- he was trying to open a restaurant in the San Fernando Valley, he was 
developing recipes for Noa Noa. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he's opened the Sawtelle Kitchen, 2024 Sawtelle Blvd., (213) 445-9288, 
which opened quietly and just for lunch two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
This week it opened for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The new place is what the old place might have been if it had opened in 1990: 
Ishi's moved with the times. Where Ishi's Grill had a spare, '50s Atomic 
</P>
<P>
Age look, which fit the Zeitgeist of the early '80s, the Sawtelle Kitchen, 
almost as small as the original Grill, is carefully designed to look earthy and 
rustic -- like the kind of restaurant you'd hope to stumble on in the French or 
Italian countryside. 
</P>
<P>
The food is rustic, too. There are tortilla pizzas (like Italian quesadillas), 
one with anchovies and capers, another with three cheeses and herbs de 
Provence; also, several pastas and salads. The dinner plates are the same 
bargain they were at the old restaurant: For $9 to $14.50 you can get, say, sea 
bass sauteed with mussels or lamb ragout, served with one of Ishi's delicious, 
silky soups or a beautifully composed salad. LAURIE OCHOA

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: MORRISON ALBUM HINDERED BY A GLARING WEAKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PolyGram Records' "The Best of Van Morrison" album has so much to recommend it 
that it's a shame the album is marred with a glaring weakness: its timidity. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, PolyGram has taken full advantage of the compact disc 
storage capacity by putting 20 songs -- or 76 minutes of music -- on the album. 
</P>
<P>
That's two more songs than is found on the cassette version of the album and 
four more tracks than is available on the vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram has also wisely avoided the temptation of limiting the selections to 
the "best" of the Morrison recordings from its own vaults. Instead, the album 
contains tracks originally released in the U.S. by four labels. 
</P>
<P>
By drawing from all phases of Morrison's extraordinary career, the album -- 
which also includes a booklet with the lyrics to all the songs -- provides us 
with a handy over-view of the work of one of the most gifted and original 
singer-songwriters of the modern pop era. 
</P>
<P>
The material ranges from Morrison's early blues-accented rock through his more 
recent, spiritually-minded Celtic strains. Among the 20 tunes: "Gloria" (his 
1965 hit with Them), "Brown Eyed Girl" (unfortunately, the "censored" 1967 
single version), "Wild Night" (from 1971's "Tupelo Honey" album) and "Whenever 
God Shines His Light" (from 1989's "Avalon Sunset" album). 
</P>
<P>
So what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
As wonderful as the music is on "The Best of Van Morrison," the album is too 
conservative. Morrison -- after more than 25 years of great music -- deserves 
more than this overview. 
</P>
<P>
He is fully as worthy of a multiple-disc retrospective as the Allman Brothers 
and Eric Clapton, both of whom have been saluted by PolyGram with boxed CD 
sets.

JAILING STAYED FOR ABORTION FOES' LAWYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-abortion lawyer Cyrus Zal, hit by an El Cajon judge with a 90-day jail 
term, won a reprieve Thursday when the California Supreme Court agreed to 
consider whether he was properly sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
Zal, a Folsom-based attorney, had been due to report today to the San Diego 
County Jail to begin serving time for contempt-of-court citations. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon Municipal Judge Larrie R. Brainard imposed the sentence at a February 
trial, at which Zal represented six anti-abortion advocates, finding that Zal 
repeatedly ignored an order not to discuss abortion during the case. 
</P>
<P>
Zal's sentence could reach 290 days because Brainard also imposed a $10,000 
fine, which Zal has indicated he cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
The judge has given him the option of paying it off at $50 for each additional 
day in jail, or 200 days. 
</P>
<P>
In a June 4 opinion, a state appellate court in San Diego upheld Zal's 
sentence, saying it was not "cruel and unusual punishment." In that opinion, 
the 4th District Court of Appeal ordered Zal to report to the San Diego County 
jail today. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, Zal appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court, 
saying the sentence would punish him for merely doing his job. 
</P>
<P>
In his appeal papers, Zal said his comments were "interruptive but not 
disruptive." 
</P>
<P>
The high court did not indicate Thursday whether it agreed or disagreed with 
Zal's claim. 
</P>
<P>
It ordered only that the imposition of the jail sentence be put off 
indefinitely while the seven justices consider the case. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication whether the Supreme Court will hold a hearing on the 
case -- or how long it will take to decide it. 
</P>
<P>
Zal had been dispatched to the February trial by the anti-abortion group 
Operation Rescue, whom he then served as general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
He resigned from that post last month. 
</P>
<P>
Zal was handed a 16-day jail term for contempt in another trial last fall in 
Fresno but never served it, winning an appeal.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANE'S CREW LOWERS LANDING GEAR BY HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A United Express commuter plane with 17 people aboard landed safely Thursday 
after an electrical problem forced the crew to lower the landing gear by hand, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The flight to Sacramento departed Long Beach Municipal Airport at 11:27 a.m. 
but turned around and was back on the ground by noon, said Federal Aviation 
Administration spokeswoman Elly Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
Instruments on the plane, a twin-engine turboprop Embraer Brasilia, indicated 
electrical problems shortly after takeoff, Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane circled the airport while the wheels were lowered. Emergency vehicles 
stood by but were not needed. Mark Peterson, spokesman for West Air Commuter 
Airlines of Fresno, parent of United Express, said there was no emergency 
evacuation of the plane and that passengers were taken to John Wayne Airport 
for a later flight.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY PANEL ENDORSES VENICE BEACH CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city Transportation Commission, seeking to ensure the safety of pedestrians 
on Ocean Front Walk in Venice and elsewhere, endorsed a proposed ordinance 
Thursday designed to crack down on reckless skateboarders, roller-skaters and 
bicyclists. The panel also approved a second ordinance that would let the 
Transportation Department establish broad restrictions over such activities. 
</P>
<P>
Both ordinances must be approved by the City Council. Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter, who represents the Venice area, last year suggested the ban on the 
"reckless operation of human-powered wheeled vehicles" in a compromise aimed at 
finding a way for skaters and pedestrians to coexist on the popular beachfront 
without endangering each other. 
</P>
<P>
Her proposal was prompted by the repeal by the council of a 10-year-old 
ordinance banning skateboarding and roller-skating along Ocean Front Walk, 
which has been largely ignored.

SUNNY AND WARMER WEATHER DUE FOR SAN DIEGO OVER THE WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY RATHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With summer nearly a week away, mostly sunny skies and gradual warming are in 
store for San Diego this weekend, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Forecaster Dan Atkins said typical June morning low clouds will probably 
blanket San Diego and may linger a little longer in the inland valleys, 
bringing a chance of morning drizzle today, but the cloud cover should burn off 
in all areas by afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins said he expects a combination of weakening low pressure and dissipating 
marine layer moving northeast to notch the temperatures upward throughout the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a nice, pleasant weekend with near-normal conditions," Atkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather is pretty much on track for this month, with maybe a little more 
sunshine than typical for this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
Beaches and the coastal strip may be a bit cool; with temperatures in the high 
60s to low 70s, but should be mostly sunny by afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Highs for the coastal strip will run 68 to 73 degrees and drop to 58 to 63 
degrees overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Inland the temperatures should range 69 to 76 degrees, with lows of 52 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
Mountains and deserts should be fair throughout the weekend, with mountain 
highs of 63 to 71 degrees, 42 to 50 nightly. 
</P>
<P>
Desert regions may reach 98 degrees and are expected to fall to 63 to 71 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is 2 to 4 feet at 12-second intervals, and the water temperature is 67 
degrees.

CANCELED STUDY LEAVES AIRPORT PLANS HANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The abrupt cancellation by Los Angeles airport commissioners of a yearlong 
study of development proposals for the much-disputed vacant Air National Guard 
property at Van Nuys Airport has left homeowners and airport officials 
wondering what will happen next. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't the slightest idea what we will do now," said Los Angeles Board of 
Airport Commissioners member Sam Greenberg, who joined three fellow 
commissioners late Wednesday in a unanimous vote to halt the study. 
</P>
<P>
The vote stunned airport staff members but delighted homeowners, who had 
mounted a fierce attack on a proposal for a massive office and industrial 
complex at the 94-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners did not give any reason for their vote to the crowd of more than 
50 residents and aircraft owners and operators. 
</P>
<P>
The disputed site is in the northwest corner of the airport, east of Balboa 
Boulevard and south of Roscoe Boulevard. Although some of the land has been 
vacant for years, about two-thirds of it became available for development two 
months ago when the Air National Guard moved to Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants had recommended that 1 million square feet of office and industrial 
space be developed there, yielding an estimated $4.7 million a year in lease 
income to the Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also would have set aside 10 acres for a park and aviation museum -- 
about the only part of the proposal that was welcomed by nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Kanon Alpert, chairman of the airport's Citizens Advisory Council and a 
leading opponent of the consultants' plan, on Thursday called the yearlong 
study a fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the airport staff could have "avoided this terrible waste of money 
if they had listened to the community instead of just plowing ahead with their 
high-intensity development plan." 
</P>
<P>
Airport spokesman Lee Nichols said that P&amp;D Technologies, the consultants, 
had been paid $337,000 to develop eight alternative plans for the site, 
including the one recommended to the board in April. 
</P>
<P>
Alpert also said that the consultants' plans were a "useless pile of proposals 
that will never be built." 
</P>
<P>
But Greenberg disagreed, saying, "They aren't necessarily useless. It remains 
to be seen whether they will ultimately be scrapped or taken up in some form." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Zeman, Van Nuys Airport manager, also disputed Alpert's assertion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they are useless," he said. "You have to explore alternatives 
before you select something." 
</P>
<P>
Zeman said he could not determine from commissioners' comments at Wednesday's 
meeting what the board wanted the staff to do next. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I can tell, we are back to ground zero with no recommended plan and 
no signposts to guide us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan has been under an increasingly dark cloud in recent months, 
particularly since April when Councilman Hal Bernson became the first council 
member to take a position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said the council is "not going to support 1 million square feet of 
offices across the street from these homes" that border the site on the west. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson's position was viewed as possibly crucial by some airport staff 
officials because his district borders the airport and because he is chairman 
of the council's influential Planning and Land Use Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Any development plan finally approved by the airport board must also be 
approved by the council and by the Federal Aviation Administration.

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN OCEANSIDE IN FEDERAL EXPRESS IMPOSTOR SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who is suspected of defrauding at least 50 people in the county out of 
cash by posing as a Federal Express employee was arrested last week by 
Oceanside police. 
</P>
<P>
William M. Renick, 46, has been charged with second-degree burglary and is 
being held in the County Jail in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Chris Pettine said Renick, if convicted, could be 
sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison and a $10,000 fine on each of 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Renick is ineligible for bail because he skipped parole in Vista in 1987, 
Pettine said. 
</P>
<P>
Renick allegedly entered TMH Video in Oceanside last week and claimed he had a 
Federal Express package from the Franchise Tax Board with $18.50 in COD 
charges. The owner, Caroline Mishler, signed for the package and paid Renick. 
</P>
<P>
After Renick left the store, Mishler discovered the package contained nothing 
but blank 1989 tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
First Lt. Marine Jay Rothmeyer was in the store during the transaction, and, 
when he left, spotted Renick a short distance away. 
</P>
<P>
"I just confronted him and told him that this woman who'd been ripped off felt 
bad," said Rothmeyer, who is stationed at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Rothmeyer said he escorted Renick back to the store and waited for police to 
arrive. Although the Marine never had to physically restrain Renick, Rothmeyer 
said he blocked the exit of the store twice when Renick tried to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Renick has allegedly committed similar crimes in Sacramento, San Francisco, Los 
Angeles and several San Diego County communities, San Diego Police Detective 
Tom Vanloon, who has been tracking the scam for five months, said.

HUMANE SOCIETY FILES COMPLAINT AGAINST ZOO IN THE DEATH OF ANIMALS; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMAL CARE: IT SAYS THE ZOO AND A TRANSPORTATION COMPANY ARE GUILTY IN DEATH 
OF FOUR ANIMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Humane Society of the United States has filed ethics complaints against the 
San Diego Zoo and an animal transport company, alleging that both are guilty of 
"gross negligence" in the treatment of four San Diego Zoo animals that died en 
route to a Massachusetts zoo in April, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Landres, a Humane Society investigator based in Washington, said her 
office has filed the complaints with the ethics committee of the American Assn. 
of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA), which is looking into the deaths of 
the four carnivores that were trucked to the Capron Park Zoo in Attleboro, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, the HSUS has filed a complaint with the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture for alleged violations of federal animal welfare regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego (Zoo) made an unwise choice," Landres said, explaining that she 
believes carnivores of this type -- a fishing cat, a sloth bear and two palm 
civets -- should be shipped by air, not by truck. "It's a combination of making 
a very bad choice and then having a transporter who obviously did not feed or 
water the animals. . . . The whole thing was preventable. We're talking gross 
negligence." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Zoo officials, who on Wednesday had expressed outrage over the 
animals' treatment and called for an AAZPA investigation of the shipper, the 
Zoological Animal Exchange, on Thursday rejected the suggestion that they were 
partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"The facts are that 13 healthy animals were put on a truck in San Diego, and 
four of those arrived dead on the East Coast," said Jeff Jouett, a zoo 
spokesman. "The issue is the quality of care received in transit, not whether 
the animals went by plane or by truck. The hauler was licensed by the USDA, was 
registered with the AAZPA, and came with good references from zoos who had used 
them before." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Lisa Landres has no experience moving carnivores of any type for the 
San Diego Zoo. And it's disappointing but predictable to see a lobbying 
organization like HSUS take a stance without knowing the facts or having an 
understanding of the issues involved." 
</P>
<P>
Landres, a one-time San Diego Zoo elephant keeper, resigned last fall because, 
she said, the zoo was punishing her for being outspoken about the beating of 
the elephant Dunda in 1988. She said Thursday that her former employer is 
passing the buck. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego needs to take a little responsibility here," she said. "They knew 
this was a bad decision. Ultimately, they were their animals. They are the ones 
who loaded them on the truck. They were responsible." 
</P>
<P>
The four animals that died were part of a larger shipment hauled by the 
Zoological Animal Exchange, a hauler based in Natural Bridge, Va. On the same 
truck were several other San Diego Zoo animals, including six Nubian ibex, a 
wild goat species, for the Bronx Zoo in New York and a Sumatran tiger for Zoo 
Atlanta in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Bronx Zoo and Zoo Atlanta said Thursday that their animals 
arrived in good condition and have remained healthy. But Dennis Branchaud, the 
superintendent of parks in Attleboro, Mass., who oversees the Capron Park Zoo, 
said that, when the truck pulled up in late April, his staff was horrified to 
find their four animals, a gift from the San Diego Zoo, dead of apparent 
dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who answered the telephone at the Zoological Animal Exchange said the 
company's owner, Eric Mogensen, would not comment on the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said a San Diego Zoo curator had recommended that the animals be flown 
instead of trucked -- a process that is generally believed to be less stressful 
for animals that are traveling long distances -- but that the three receiving 
zoos did not heed that recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"We fly animals whenever possible. It is our preference. But it is not always 
possible," he said. "But to say that carnivores shouldn't be trucked is 
ridiculous. The pertinent issue is how the animal is cared for from point A to 
point B. Whether it is eating meat or eating hay has absolutely nothing to do 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park is the largest mover of zoo animals in 
the world, Jouett said. Last year, the zoo alone moved 410 mammals. Two died, 
both of them herbivores. 
</P>
<P>
"We've used trucks, planes, boats, and animals arrive alive and well if the 
transporter is qualified, competent and experienced," Jouett said. "We had 
every indication and reason to believe when the driver left here that the 
animals were in capable hands. Our impression now is that is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
James Doherty, the general curator of the Bronx Zoo, said that his staff had 
arranged to transport only the ibex via the Zoological Animal Exchange, which 
he had used before. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the arrangements for the ibex to be picked up and, as far as we knew, 
they were the only animals on the truck," Doherty said, noting that it is quite 
common for hoof stock to be trucked. "We knew nothing about Zoo Atlanta or the 
other zoo. . . . I don't know of anyone at Capron Park Zoo. I'd never heard of 
it before. I knew nothing about a tiger going to the Atlanta zoo." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "It's unfortunate the way it came out." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Terry Maple, the director of Zoo Atlanta, said his staff had arranged with 
San Diego to "piggy-back" on the Bronx Zoo's scheduled shipment. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no debate about it. We said, let's use the shipper that's already 
coming," said Maple, who said that this week he heard for the first time that 
San Diego would have preferred flying the animals. "I understand (now) that San 
Diego felt that the shipment of animals should have been flown. That was not an 
option that we discussed with the sender that I know of." 
</P>
<P>
Branchaud, meanwhile, said that, although he signed off on the choice of the 
Zoological Animal Exchange, which he had used before, he was not involved in 
arranging the transport. He said all he knew was what the San Diego Zoo told 
him -- the date he could expect the animals to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"All I knew is they were coming on that date," he said. "We were just the ones 
who had to discover the sad news." 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely upset over the whole business. It hurt us quite a bit," he 
said. Recently, he said, the San Diego Zoo has replaced one of the dead animals 
with a healthy sloth bear. It arrived by plane. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA regulations regarding animal transportation specify that live animals 
be offered fresh water at least every 12 hours and fresh food at least once in 
each 24 hour period, and that a sufficient quantity of food and water accompany 
the animal during transit. Drivers are also required to visually observe the 
animals no less than once every four hours. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA also requires that the owner of the animal, in this case the San Diego 
Zoo, provide written instructions to the hauler concerning the food and 
watering requirements of each animal being transported. Jouett said this was 
done. 
</P>
<P>
"The animals traveled with keeper transfer documents that included their diets 
and care requirements," he said. "We explained the individual animals' 
personalities and care requirements to the driver. We offered containers of 
water, meat, feeds, hay, feline diet and were told by the driver, 'No, thanks, 
I've got it under control.' " 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the AAZPA, Karen Asis, said she could not confirm or comment 
on any formal investigation, but acknowledged that the case "is under serious 
consideration by the AAZPA." She said the group's ultimate recourse would be to 
suspend any member found guilty of wrongdoing. But it is unlikely any action 
could be taken before this fall, she said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego animal rights activists said the animal deaths raise questions about 
how well the AAZPA is monitoring its members. 
</P>
<P>
"How many incidents does it take to prove that we must have an independent body 
to govern Zoo activities," Sally Mackler, director of San Diego Animal 
Advocates, said in a statement.

HORTON PLAZA TO PUT CURBS ON FREE PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Horton Plaza in downtown San Diego is changing its parking policy to discourage 
non-shoppers from using the parking structure, said Craig Pettitt, general 
manager of the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, those parking in the 2,400-car structure will still get 
three free hours of parking, but will have to get their parking tickets 
validated by any of the merchants in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers have to make a purchase to get validation, but there is no minimum 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
Customers now are often turned away because people who work in the area are 
taking advantage of the three free hours of parking, Pettitt said Thursday in a 
press conference at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are turning away customers, obviously we are turning away dollars," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 3 million cars that used the parking structure last year, 20% to 30% 
were not shoppers, Pettitt said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the structure had to be closed 110 times, for varying lengths of 
time, last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate goal is to never close the parking structure," Pettitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy goes into effect July 2, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Validated parking will cost $1 per half hour after the three free hours. 
Nonvalidated parking will cost $1 per half hour and will no longer be free 
after 5 p.m. Pettitt criticized nearby merchants not located in Horton Plaza 
who encourage their customers -- often in advertisements -- to use Horton 
garage.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GATES SUSPENDS OFFICER FOR RESTAURANT BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles police sergeant who was involved in a brawl last year at a 
Burbank restaurant was suspended by Chief Daryl F. Gates for six months 
Thursday, despite a recommendation from a police board that the officer be 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
Gates ordered Sgt. Christopher Bonilla, 32, suspended without pay immediately 
from his patrol supervisor's position at the Wilshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla, a nine-year veteran, was among six off-duty officers who fought with a 
patron and five employees at the Black Angus restaurant, 235 S. 1st St., after 
a dispute over a spilled bottle of beer in the restaurant's bar, Burbank police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla and two of the officers pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace earlier 
this year and were fined $470 each. 
</P>
<P>
A six-day Board of Rights hearing ended last week with a recommendation that 
Bonilla be fired for three counts of misconduct, including drinking, making 
threats and kicking a man who had been dragged out of the restaurant by the 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
A Board of Rights, made up of three high-ranking officers, can only make 
recommendations on discipline and Gates is not bound to follow them. Lt. Fred 
Nixon said Gates reduced the recommended penalty without comment. 
</P>
<P>
The department took lesser disciplinary action against the five other officers.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSE GETS BILL ON BASIN, RIVER PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House Appropriations Committee sent to the full House this week a water and 
energy development bill for fiscal 1991 that includes $2.5 million for the 
Sepulveda Basin, $700,000 to study expanded use of the Los Angeles River and 
$272,000 for restoration of Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) had sought $5 million for additional 
landscaping, open space, trails and parking in the Sepulveda Basin and $1 
million for a study of the Los Angeles River's recreational, transportation and 
water conservation potential. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson plans to continue pressing for the additional $2.5 million in the 
1992 budget, legislative assistant Melissa Kuckro said. Although the request 
for river study funds was also reduced, she said the Appropriations Committee 
generally provides a maximum of $500,000 for river studies but recognized that 
this project was unusually complicated and costly. 
</P>
<P>
Funds for Hansen Dam in the northeast San Fernando Valley, which were requested 
by Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), are set aside in a 4-year-old 
federal trust fund. The money is generated by the fees paid by a contractor who 
is digging silt from flood control channels. The contractor, who sells the silt 
to construction firms, pays between 15 and 25 cents into the fund for each ton 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
Berman also included language in the bill directing the U. S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, which owns the 1,540-acre dam area, to continue the dredging until 
it is completed. The corps is completing a master plan and environmental impact 
statement for revitalization of the long-neglected lake property in Pacoima and 
Lake View Terrace. 
</P>

The House is expected to approve the water and energy development bill as 
crafted by the Appropriations Committee. The Senate will adopt its own version, 
and representatives from each chamber will meet to reconcile the two measures.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PIERCE COLLEGE CUTS SPEECH, DEBATE TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Budget troubles have prompted elimination of the Pierce College debate and 
speech teams in the fall, school officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Campus officials have decided not to replace outgoing forensics team coach Jeff 
Cooper, saving an estimated $50,000, said Jim Lagerstrom, head of the Pierce 
Speech Department. None of the department's four full-time teachers are willing 
to take over coaching duties, Lagerstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, school officials announced cancellation of the agriculture 
department's dairy classes as part of a budget-cutting effort among campuses in 
the Los Angeles Community College District.

HOSPITALS CAN SUE STATES OVER MEDICAID COSTS 
</P>

<P>
In a potentially costly defeat for state and federal governments, the Supreme 
Court ruled Thursday that hospitals may sue in federal court to obtain a 
"reasonable and adequate" reimbursement for treating needy patients. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1965, the government has required hospitals to treat the poor under the 
Medicaid program, and it has promised in law that they would be paid for their 
services. Increasingly, however, neither state nor federal officials have lived 
up to that promise. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in California were paid an average of only 61% of the cost of 
treating needy patients last year and were shortchanged nearly $1 billion under 
MediCal, according to figures compiled by the California Assn. of Hospitals and 
Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
On a 5-4 vote, the high court said that hospitals have a right to get a 
"reasonable and adequate" reimbursement and may go to a federal court to seek 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely important ruling for us," said Christine Hall, general 
counsel for the state hospital association in Sacramento. "We have been giving 
millions of dollars in uncompensated care. It is critical for us to be able to 
go to court to challenge the reimbursement policies." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with higher costs and inadequate reimbursements, many hospitals have cut 
back services to the poor. In other instances, they have passed on the costs of 
treating poor patients to patients who pay and to those patients' insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Medicaid program is funded jointly by the federal and state governments. 
The U.S. government, which pays at least 50% of the program's cost, sets 
general regulations, but states devise their own reimbursement formulas for 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Congress passed legislation commonly called the Boren Amendment that 
requires the states to pay hospitals a "reasonable and adequate (reimbursement) 
to meet the costs, which must be incurred by efficiently and economically 
operated facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the states assure Washington that their payment levels are 
reasonable -- even though the hospitals say that they are being badly 
shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Virginia Hospital Assn. filed a lawsuit against the state, 
contending that the 1980 amendment gave the hospitals a civil right that could 
be enforced in federal court. Last year, an appeals court in Richmond, Va., 
agreed, but the Virginia governor filed an appeal with the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the court Thursday, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. said the "Boren 
Amendment to the Medicaid Act creates a right, enforceable in a private cause 
of action" by the hospitals to seek a reasonable and adequate reimbursement 
from the state. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan's decision in the case (Wilder vs. Virginia Hospital Assn., 88-2043) 
was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and 
John Paul Stevens. The dissenters, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, 
contended that the reimbursement policies are to be decided by state and 
federal officials, not the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Duke University law professor Walter Dellinger said that the ruling marks a 
major shift in how the Medicaid program will be funded. 
</P>
<P>
"For a quarter of a century, it has been the public policy of the United States 
to provide medical treatment to the very poorest Americans," said Dellinger, 
who represented the Virginia hospitals. "The court has now recognized that 
Congress intended this cost to be borne by the federal and state governments, 
not by the hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger said that Virginia hospitals were losing about $1 million a week 
treating Medicaid patients. "Now they can go to court to get an adequate level 
of reimbursement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A brief filed on behalf of the 50 states had urged the court to overturn the 
Virginia ruling, arguing that their hard-pressed treasuries could be hit with 
hundreds of millions of dollars in higher costs. The Bush Administration also 
had urged the court to rule for the states. In 1988, the Medicaid program cost 
the federal government $29 billion. 
</P>
<P>
If federal courts were to rule that hospitals deserve reimbursement for the 
full cost of treating Medicaid patients, the states could face billions of 
dollars in higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Department of Health Services in Sacramento refused to comment 
on the high court ruling Thursday, saying that they had not yet had a chance to 
read it.

CONGRESS OKS UNPAID LEAVES FOR BIRTH, ILLNESS 
</P>

<P>
Defying a White House veto threat, the Senate gave final congressional approval 
Thursday to landmark legislation that would require large companies and 
governments to grant unpaid family or medical leave to their employees. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate adopted by voice vote a House-passed compromise bill that would 
allow workers to take time off to care for newborn babies or seriously ill 
parents or to recover from sickness themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, long sought by women's organizations and labor unions but opposed 
strongly by business groups, was sent to President Bush. White House Chief of 
Staff John H. Sununu already has promised business lobbyists that the President 
would veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
An election year veto, however, could diminish Bush's popularity among working 
families in view of his campaign promises of a "kinder, gentler nation" that 
would not deprive women of their jobs if they had to take time off from work to 
have a baby or care for a sick child. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to see whether this is rhetoric alone," said Senate Democratic 
Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
The bill had passed by a margin of 237 to 187 in the House, well short of the 
two-thirds majority required to override a veto. Republican supporters of the 
legislation, however, said they would appeal to the President to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's swift action came as a surprise because GOP opponents had 
threatened to filibuster against the controversial bill. They ultimately 
decided to let it go through without even a roll call vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a consensus on a bill that I thought would be debated for days," said 
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), chief sponsor of the legislation. Dodd 
appealed to Bush to take a close look at the bill in hopes that the President 
would not exercise a veto that Congress could not override. 
</P>
<P>
Senate sources said opponents of the measure did not want to go on record 
against the family leave bill in an election year when some would have to 
explain their stand to their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would require firms with 50 or more workers, as well as state and 
local governments, to grant employees as much as 12 weeks of unpaid leave for 
specified family or medical reasons without losing any health insurance 
coverage during their absences. Federal employees would be entitled to longer 
leave periods under the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Employers would be required to guarantee the jobs of workers who take the 
unpaid leave. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates said the legislation is the first breakthrough in government 
recognition of the vast increase in the number of two-earner families and 
mothers of small children in the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, contended that the bill would increase costs to employers 
and set a bad precedent for government intervention in setting job conditions 
that might reduce other employee benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime we mandate anything, it's bad public policy," Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost," said Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), another opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) recalled during the debate that he took a 
great deal of time away from the Senate when his son, Teddy, was hospitalized 
with cancer in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"As a senator, I was able to take time off from work to care for my child," 
Kennedy said. "Millions of Americans are not so lucky. No working Americans 
should be denied the opportunity to fulfill their basic obligations as 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the bill relied on government figures showing that nearly 
three-fourths of married women with school-age children are working, and more 
than half of all mothers with preschool children are in the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
To get the legislation through the House -- and through the Senate without an 
all-out battle -- the sponsors modified it considerably. Instead of affecting 
firms with 20 or more workers, the revised version would apply only to 
companies with 50 or more workers. That would reduce the impact to just 5% of 
all employers from 12% under the original legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Employees would be required to have at least one year with their company to 
qualify for leave and would have to work at least 1,000 hours a year to 
qualify. Leave would be allowed for childbirth, adoption and serious illness of 
a child, a parent, a spouse or the employee. 
</P>
<P>
Employers would not be required to provide the leave to "key employees," 
defined as the highest-paid 10% of a company's work force. Special rules would 
be enforced for school employees to minimize disruption of classes. 
</P>
<P>
A doctor's certification would be required to justify leaves in cases of 
serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Lichtman, chairman of a coalition of organizations supporting the bill, 
said that she is "thrilled" by the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly pleased that the vote came just days before Father's Day 
-- truly wonderful timing, especially since the House voted right before 
Mother's Day," she said. "Now the focus is on President Bush, and we are by no 
means convinced that he will veto this bill," she said.

UNBELIEVABLE: When the Ripley's Believe It or Not museum opens Aug. 24 in Buena 
Park, its centerpiece will be the crushed Chevrolet Sprint (above with museum 
worker John Dailey) in which 57-year-old Buck Helm survived four days before 
his rescue from the Nimitz Freeway collapse in Oakland last October. . . . A 
Ripley's spokesman said that after Helm died in November of his injuries in the 
Bay Area earthquake, his family offered the car free to the museum on the 
condition that it remain in California. . . . The car was too big for Ripley's 
San Francisco museum, where the license plates now are displayed. Mark I.

THE GULF OF MEXICO BESIEGED; 
</P>
<P>
ONE OF THE NATION'S MAJOR BODIES OF WATER IS A SEA AT RISK. A TANKER SPILL 
PALES IN COMPARISON WITH IMPACTS FROM OIL FACILITIES, CITIES AND AGRICULTURE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Even before the stricken Norwegian tanker Mega Borg exploded and caught fire 
last week, threatening an oil spill three times larger than the Exxon Valdez 
disaster, the Gulf of Mexico was a sea at risk. 
</P>
<P>
From the Florida Keys to the Rio Grande, the Gulf of Mexico has been under an 
unrelenting environmental siege that makes the Mega Borg's 3-million-gallon 
spill pale by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution from the gulf's sprawling petrochemical complexes, shipping, growing 
urbanization and agricultural practices are adding up to one of the most 
formidable assaults in the nation on a major ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
So serious is the problem becoming that some are beginning to draw comparisons 
with the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean, two of the most-polluted bodies of 
water in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't reached Mediterranean proportions yet, but we're headed in that 
direction," said Tom Miller of the Center for Marine Conservation in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Lipka, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Gulf of 
Mexico Program, headquartered at Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, said the 
time is quickly approaching when the gulf may cross over a "critical point" of 
some irreversible environmental impacts. 
</P>
<P>
Half of Galveston Bay -- long known for its rich oyster beds and shrimp grounds 
-- is off limits to oyster harvesting because of sewage discharges. Up to 3,000 
square miles of bottom waters off the Louisiana and southeastern Texas coasts 
are known as the "dead zone," a watery desert where nothing lives because 
pollutants have depleted the oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60% of the gulf's shellfish-growing areas -- about 3.4 million acres -- 
are either permanently closed or have restrictions placed on them because of 
rising concentrations of toxic chemicals and sewage. 
</P>
<P>
In Louisiana, sensitive coastal marsh habitats are vanishing at the rate of 50 
to 60 square miles a year, threatening the natural productive cycles of 
commercial shrimp and fish. 
</P>
<P>
At the southern tip of Florida, 80,000 acres of bay sea grass, which acts as a 
veritable nursery for all kinds of marine life, has been killed by a virus. 
Scientists speculate that pollutants in the water from urban runoff and 
agricultural fields weakened the plant's resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's Gulf of Mexico Project is forcing an analysis of the gulf as a 
single, complex environmental system. Representatives of the gulf states, 
federal agencies, the public, environmental groups, industry and academia are 
involved in fashioning a strategy for which they hope to build a consensus to 
rectify the damage. But unless action is taken soon, many fear that significant 
stretches of the Gulf Coast will meet the same fate as the Chesapeake Bay, with 
fisheries collapsing and water quality deteriorating at a cost counted in 
untold millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. Fully 40% of the nation's most productive fishing grounds, 
including the most valuable shrimp beds, are found in the gulf. Half of the 
nation's wetlands, including 30 estuaries -- the breeding grounds for 98% of 
all commercial fish caught in the gulf -- dot the gulf's rim. They also provide 
a haven for 75% of the migratory waterfowl that traverse the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, tourism is a highly profitable business for the gulf counties, 
pumping $5 billion into the economy. Polluted beaches, tainted water and the 
ton of ocean debris found per mile that washes up on many of Texas' most 
popular beaches doesn't help 
</P>
<P>
A still unpublished draft of a report by the EPA warns that " . . . we risk 
serious long-term environmental damage to this vast and unique marine system if 
we do not begin comprehensively planning today." 
</P>
<P>
"There are mammoth kinds of problems that will require major changes in the way 
we do business," said Lipka of the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
For many fishermen, time is already running out. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the deck of the shrimp boat Evening Star in Texas City, crew member 
Eddie Schrameck talked of hard times. Shrimp catches are down, and his skipper 
has been forced to go after "bait shrimp" to make ends meet because of 
declining numbers of table shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Schrameck, whose weathered face, pale blue eyes and a wiry red beard speak 
silently of the sea, doesn't doubt what caused their misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
"I know exactly what the reason is," he drawled. "Too much competition. Too 
many boats -- and there's pollution in that water. We've pulled up fish that 
got fungus all over 'em. It's hard to believe they're still alive. There's 
something in that water, I do believe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, Jimmy Priest is presiding at the counter of his bait shop on the 
Texas City dike within sight of a sprawling chemical plant. 
</P>
<P>
"The pollution is hurting us, that's for sure. But we don't know where it's 
coming from. We don't even know what it is," Priest said. 
</P>
<P>
Others do. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the nation's offshore oil and gas production is found in the 
gulf. Half of the country's oil refineries and chemical plants ring the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the top five states in total surface water discharges of toxic 
chemicals are gulf states -- Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"That carries with it a very large burden of pollutants from industrial 
sources, runoff from cities, water from agricultural fields and ships. It all 
comes down and ends up in the Gulf of Mexico," said Edward Proffitt, director 
of the Florida regional office of the Center for Marine Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Gulf ports handle 45% of all U.S. import-export shipping tonnage and 38% of 
crude oil tonnage. Six of the nation's top 10 ports in crude oil shipments are 
in gulf states. 
</P>
<P>
At Galveston, half of all the 3,756 waste dischargers in Texas dump their 
wastes directly or indirectly into the bay, according to Linda Shead, executive 
director of the nonprofit Galveston Bay Foundation. Many of the dischargers are 
as far north as Dallas and Ft. Worth, who dump pollutants into the Trinity 
River for a 300-mile journey south before they land in the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Galveston Bay is on the edge," she said. "It is still classified as the 
second-most productive estuary in the U.S. But stresses on the system are so 
great that if we do anything too drastic, we could push it over the brink." 
</P>
<P>
The bay is ringed by high concentrations of petrochemical plants with hundreds 
of tall, narrow stacks that from a distance look like minarets. 
</P>
<P>
Small, single-neighborhood sewage treatment plants and septic systems are known 
to frequently malfunction, pouring raw sewage into the waters. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh water from many of the 44 river systems that flow into the gulf once 
alleviated some of the problems, but now the rivers are being diverted from 
coastal estuaries to meet the needs of thirsty and growing cities, recreation 
and flood control. 
</P>
<P>
The pumping of water, oil and gas from beneath the ground contributes to the 
subsidence of land. This is in turn accounts for the loss of environmentally 
sensitive marshes as sea water flows in and covers them. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the wetland losses in Louisiana are blamed on oil companies, which over 
the years have cut canals into the swamps and marshes for barges that carry oil 
drilling rigs and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these problems, pressure for industrialization continues. The Texas 
Copper Corp. is advancing a controversial proposal for a new copper smelter 
bordering on the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Developers, contractors and other continue to push for widening and deeping the 
Houston Ship Channel, which stretches 50 miles from the city to the gulf. 
Opponents fear dredging will stir up toxic sediments and compound an already 
serious pollution problem. 
</P>
<P>
"In Texas we don't have the same level of environmental awareness that exists 
on the East and West coasts, and we have a much bigger industrial side to our 
culture," observed Frank S. Shipley, program manager of an EPA-funded Galveston 
Bay Project, which is preparing to carry out studies similar to those under way 
for Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
But there is growing recognition that something must be done. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody contributes to the problem. I can't deny that," said Larry Wall, 
spokesman for the Louisiana Mid-Continental Oil and Gas Assn. But he said 
industry is attempting to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry realizes it has an obligation to protect and enhance the 
environment. It realizes that things were done in the past that had an adverse 
impact. We didn't know any better. Nobody knew any better," Wall insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, the industry plans to cut no more canals into the wetlands, or to 
mitigate environmental impacts when it does. It is also negotiating over future 
limits of toxic discharges into the estuaries and canals. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he admitted, environmentalists say the petroleum industry is not going 
nearly far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking," said Wall. "The problem we run into is everybody finds more 
problems than we have solutions for. They want solutions yesterday for 
something we've been doing for 40 years."

SOVIETS CALL OFF PLAN TO TRIPLE BREAD PRICES 
</P>

<P>
Afraid of bread riots and protest strikes, Soviet lawmakers on Thursday 
prohibited the government from tripling bread prices on July 1 as planned and 
instead ordered it to develop a new, less painful, less risky strategy for 
reducing food subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, voted overwhelmingly, 319-33 
with 12 abstentions, to delay at least until September any rise in bread prices 
despite the government's insistence that an immediate increase is an essential 
part of the overall program for economic reform that was approved Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The people had been fooled more than once, and there is much mistrust now," 
Deputy Alexei Boyko, chairman of the commission that reviewed the economic 
plan, explained later. "They are afraid of being duped again." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials, despite many statements by Prime Minister Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov and his deputies and ministers, failed to persuade Soviet consumers 
that they will be protected from most of the planned increases in food prices 
through higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
The officials have also argued that there should soon be more food because 
farmers will be paid more for what they grow, and that through this process, 
the government's budget deficit will be cut as the food subsidies are 
transformed into higher wages paid by Soviet enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of sleight-of-hand economics is this?" one deputy asked during the 
renewed debate this week. "The government wants to raise bread prices but give 
us back the money in our pay packets. Why bother? There must be more to it than 
they are telling us. Imagine a socialist government tripling bread prices! 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the workers won't be fooled. They will go on strike across the country 
in protest. Woe be to us if we approve this!" 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kraiko, a Moscow scientist, described the vote as "a defeat for the 
government but also a defeat for the Supreme Soviet." 
</P>
<P>
"Parliaments cannot shrink from difficult, unpopular decisions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But with fresh memories of the panic buying that emptied stores in Moscow, 
Leningrad, Kiev and other major cities last month when higher prices were first 
announced, the lawmakers were clearly unwilling to test popular sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Coal miners, oil field workers and railway men, moreover, have all threatened 
strikes in recent weeks over pay and living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The miners, meeting in the Ukrainian industrial center of Donetsk, on Thursday 
demanded that the Ryzhkov government resign because of the failure, 
acknowledged by senior government ministers, to honor commitments to improve 
living conditions that were made to end a coal strike last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Soviet Union does not have our trust," the miners said 
in a telegram to the Supreme Soviet. "We urge workers in other industries to 
cut their ties quickly with this government." 
</P>
<P>
Bread is the main staple, making up 20% of the average diet. For Russians, 
bread on the table is essential at every meal -- as much to assure them of 
their well-being as to nourish them. 
</P>
<P>
But for many of the 41 million Soviet citizens who are below the official 
poverty line -- about 15% of the population -- bread and other subsidized foods 
are essential to their survival. Deputies expressed considerable concern 
Thursday that the proposed increases in pay, pensions and welfare allowances 
would not cover the increases in food prices -- and those that would inevitably 
follow in other goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, the real focus of fear among the lawmakers was Central 
Asia, where social discontent is now so high that the smallest developments can 
cause massive unrest. 
</P>
<P>
A quarrel over new land being allocated for housing and private farming led to 
inter-ethnic riots this month in Kirghizia. The Soviet Interior Ministry on 
Thursday put the death toll at 155, but Radio Moscow's Interfax news service 
said that 170 deaths had been registered with the military commandant's office 
in the Kirghiz city of Osh, the center of the rioting. 
</P>
<P>
"The deputies from Central Asia were very worried that the increase in bread 
prices would create discontent," Boyko said. "There, the discontent could be 
serious indeed." 
</P>
<P>
The price increase was expected to bring in about $24 billion, at the official 
rate of exchange, significantly reducing the government's current consumer 
subsidies of $120 billion a year and its overall budget deficit of $144 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate Thursday, deputies rejected a series of alternative proposals 
that would have permitted the government to make a decision before the next 
parliamentary session. 
</P>
<P>
The government's proposal to consult "high bodies of state power" and report 
back to the legislature was not even put to a vote as deputies made clear that 
they wanted to retain control of the sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet instead ordered the Council of Ministers to draft a new plan 
that, it said, must be acceptable to the governments of the Soviet Union's 15 
constituent republics. The lawmakers will review this proposal when they meet 
again in September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Bread is truly the staff of life to the Soviet citizen, especially those living 
below the poverty line. But the government contended through the three weeks of 
debate over the economic reform program that bread is priced so low that it is 
wasted in huge amounts. The current price of about 37 cents for a loaf that 
weighs 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) has been unchanged for nearly 30 years. Imports 
account for about 40% of the grain consumed, making bread subsidies even more 
expensive.

REBOUNDING BRADLEY PUTS 'WORST YEAR' BEHIND HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buoyed by indications that his once-plummeting popularity has rebounded, Mayor 
Tom Bradley expressed confidence this week that problems which plagued his 
Administration for the last 18 months have come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
In his first interview in nine months, Bradley said this week that he would not 
rule out a run for an unprecedented sixth term in 1993. Such prospects seemed 
extremely remote only a year ago when, buffeted by allegations of misconduct, 
Bradley squeaked through a primary race with the smallest victory margin since 
he was first elected mayor in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley described 1989 as "the worst year of my entire life," saying he felt 
"helpless" in the face of "the accusations, the allegations, the speculation." 
There were times, despite attempts to paint a business-as-usual picture, that 
the Bradley Administration seemed paralyzed by the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Bradley said, questions about his personal finances and use of political 
influence are rarely raised at public appearances, and the 72-year-old mayor 
said he is "absolutely confident" that he will be cleared of wrongdoing by an 
ongoing federal investigation into allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's upbeat outlook stems in part from a poll taken for former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein last month during her successful primary 
campaign for governor. The poll showed that Bradley's popularity among voters 
has returned to its early 1989 level, when he was one of the most popular 
politicians in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of Bradley's standing, the Feinstein campaign incorporated his 
photo in a pre-election mailer and asked him to introduce Feinstein at her 
post-primary "Democratic unity" press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Relaxed and cheerful as he sat near the coffee table in his office, Bradley 
spoke at length late Wednesday afternoon about a range of public and private 
matters, from homelessness and illegal drugs to his future and the recent past. 
He reserved most of his sharpest comments for the press and its investigations 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen various people who've taken a bashing in the press," he said, "and 
if you immediately, on the heels of that kind of political bashing or general 
public criticism in the press, ask people their reaction, they're going to 
remember what they last saw in the paper or in the press. 
</P>
<P>
"So it surely must have some impact. Then you move away in time from that 
particular period in your life . . . and I think you come up with a more normal 
reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Of the last year, Bradley said: "It was the worst year of my entire life. It 
went on and on, day after day, and you know you're literally helpless to do 
anything except ignore it and go about your business and wait for an official 
finding to come out of some inquiry. You start by denying it and the stories 
continue. You're almost without any ability to put it to rest." 
</P>
<P>
The cycle of scandal began early last year with reports that, while mayor, 
Bradley had served as a paid adviser to two financial institutions that had 
dealings with the city. One of the institutions, Far East National Bank, 
received $2 million in city deposits the same day that Bradley telephoned 
then-City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg to inquire about the bank's status. Both 
Bradley and Rittenberg have denied that Bradley attempted to influence the 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing after an investigation by City 
Atty. James K. Hahn. In a scathing report, however, Hahn declared that Bradley 
had become "indifferent to . . . ethical concerns." 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic public admission in May, 1989, Bradley told a stunned City 
Council that he made "an error in judgment" in creating the appearance of a 
conflict of interest between his employment by private firms and his 
simultaneous mayoral actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was insensitive not to realize that accepting outside employment could 
create the perceptions we see today," Bradley said. "In retrospect, my decision 
to engage in outside employment was a mistake because of the perceptions it 
created. I now recognize that error, and I will always regret it." 
</P>
<P>
Questions also arose about whether Bradley used undue influence to help 
associates -- including Abraham Spiegel, chairman of Columbia Savings &amp; 
Loan; Mary Anne Singer, a lobbyist who was a Bradley friend, and Allen Alevy, a 
campaign fund-raiser. Bradley's stock portfolio, including junk bonds acquired 
through Drexel Burnham Lambert, also became a source of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury investigation was initiated and Hahn filed a civil lawsuit 
against Bradley for failing to disclose personal investments worth $160,000. 
Last December, the mayor agreed to pay a $20,000 fine to settle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1989, Bradley returned $18,000 he had earned in 1988 as an adviser to 
Far East after he learned that the bank had received deposits from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times polls taken in that year showed that Bradley's popularity had 
plummeted. By September, the percentage of people who had a favorable 
impression of Bradley had dropped to 45%. In early 1986, the number had been 
75%. During the same time period, the share of people who had an unfavorable 
impression of Bradley had climbed to 46% from 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The Feinstein campaign poll, conducted last month, gave Bradley an approval 
rating of more than 65% and a favorable-to-unfavorable rating of 3 to 1, 
according to Hank Morris, a Feinstein campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"If you weren't here in the middle, then you wouldn't know there was a middle," 
Morris said. "He's very, very popular with the voters. It's striking for 
someone who's been in public life as long as he has." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Bradley would not address in detail any of the allegations 
that had been brought against him in the course of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said his office has supplied federal investigators with all the 
documents requested, and said he has not been questioned by them or asked to 
testify before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the performance of the press, Bradley said: "In all candor, I've 
been concerned about news stories that are based upon what is largely 
speculation about various things. And maybe somebody's trying to win a Pulitzer 
by being another Woodward and Bernstein." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he does not think that press attacks against him are over and 
added: "I don't think this is a Los Angeles phenomenon. I think it is something 
I've observed all across the country." Other than the press, people in Los 
Angeles seem uninterested in the matter, Bradley said, and have difficulty 
grasping the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't understand what this whole thing was all about," Bradley said. 
"People who have known me, who have watched me, would say to me from time to 
time, 'That is so completely different than the Tom Bradley we know that we 
just ignore it.' " 
</P>
<P>
During his frequent public appearances throughout the city, Bradley said, 
people complain of the same problems they brought up 20 years ago: crime, lack 
of housing, drugs, gangs and joblessness. 
</P>
<P>
His agenda for the next three years will place more attention on the lack of 
affordable housing -- "a huge, huge problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another high priority, Bradley said, is expansion of an after-school program 
now in place in 20 public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see it in every elementary school," he said. Such programs are the 
wave of the future, he said, "if we are to break the cycle of failure and 
returning to gangs and crime that are so much a part of the scene all across 
this country." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said his health is "terrific. It never changes." He rises each morning 
at 5:40 a.m. to ride an exercise bicycle for 20 to 25 minutes while he reads 
the newspaper. "I make maximum use of my time," he said. His days generally end 
with several personal appearances in the evening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley travels often on city, port and airport business, but said he almost 
never takes vacations. 
</P>
<P>
"The only real vacation that I planned was one to France in 1974," Bradley 
said. "It turned out after three days everybody discovered I was in town, in 
Paris, and they began bombarding me with requests for official and 
semi-official visits. So I gave up . . . and I have not planned or taken a 
vacation since." 
</P>
<P>
While he said he has made no decision about the 1993 election, Bradley said he 
has no plans to retire either. "I don't even think about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding 1993, he added: "If you've got three years before you need to make a 
decision, I see no point in rushing. In the meantime I'm happy, I'm enjoying my 
work."

DEUKMEJIAN DEFENDS BUILDUP OF PRISON SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Standing outside the state's newest penitentiary, Gov. George Deukmejian on 
Thursday defended his unprecedented prison building program, saying 
Californians are safer today than they were a decade ago because he has doubled 
the size of the state prison system. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, speaking at the dedication of Pelican Bay State Prison on the north 
coast near Crescent City, also criticized Los Angeles-area officials for 
seeking to block the construction of lock-ups planned for downtown Los Angeles 
and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Officials here in Del Norte County, he noted, requested that a prison be built 
in their community because the sagging timber and fishing industries had left 
the local economy in shambles. But 50% of the inmates currently housed at the 
new facility come from Los Angeles County, which has no state prison, 
Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles, rather than throwing up barriers to us, should be cooperative in 
supporting our effort," Deukmejian told reporters after the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Deukmejian mocked those who have suggested that the state should 
seek less costly, and less restrictive, alternatives to prison. He said that 
approach was tried in the 1960s and 1970s but failed. 
</P>
<P>
"While we were trying to 'understand' these criminals, California's crime rate 
soared,"he said. "The number of major crimes quadrupled. By 1980, one in every 
25 Californians was robbed or beaten, raped or murdered, their homes 
burglarized or their car stolen." 
</P>
<P>
During his term, Deukmejian has presided over the construction of 10 new prison 
projects, and four more lock-ups are under construction. The number of prison 
beds has climbed from about 24,000 when Deukmejian took office to nearly 51,000 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said it was "no coincidence" that during his tenure the state's 
violent crime rate dropped and cited a decline between 20% and 35% in various 
types in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The message has been clear," he said. "Commit these crimes and you will go to 
prison." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also took the opportunity to fire the first salvo in a fight he will 
carry into the November elections, making a pitch for a proposed amendment to 
the state Constitution that would allow the state to force prison inmates to 
work to help pay for their keep and pay restitution to their victims. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican chief executive used the initiative process to qualify the 
measure for the ballot after the Democratic-controlled Legislature killed a 
more modest compromise proposal last year. 
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders have complained that the proposal would exploit prisoners and 
deprive law-abiding citizens of jobs. But Deukmejian said the impact on the 
private labor market would be minuscule. He said that if half of the 92,000 
inmates now imprisoned got jobs under the program, they would represent less 
than one-half of 1% of the state's total work force. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not going to have any significant impact at all on the work force," 
Deukmejiansaid.

FLAG AMENDMENT FACES UPHILL FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: HOUSE FOES OF THE ANTI-DESECRATION MEASURE SAY THEY ARE ONE VOTE 
SHORT OF BLOCKING THE BILL. BOTH SIDES PUSH THEIR CAUSES WITH MEDIA EVENTS.

Despite election-year pressures, opponents of a constitutional amendment 
against desecrating the American flag said Thursday that they have lined up all 
but one of the votes needed to kill the proposed measure in the House. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in good shape," said Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), a leader of the 
opposition to an amendment, as lawmakers on both sides of the issue seized on 
Flag Day to unfurl waves of red, white and blue rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents, led by President Bush, renewed their campaign this week after the 
Supreme Court struck down a flag-protection statute passed eight months ago. 
The law had been designed to counter an earlier court ruling that flag burning 
is a constitutionally protected form of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Leadership sources said that 144 House members had given "hard" indications 
that they would vote against the proposed amendment when it comes to the floor, 
probably next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
With a two-thirds majority required for approval of a constitutional amendment, 
opponents need only 145 votes to block it, assuming all 433 current members 
show up for the roll call. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the House passes the measure, opponents expressed optimism that they 
could kill it in the Senate, where it is expected to be considered the week 
after next. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), surveying colleagues on behalf 
of opponents to the measure, counted 54 senators for the flag amendment and 24 
against it late Thursday, with 22 undecided. That would leave opponents 10 
votes short of the amount needed to block approval. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am quite confident the amendment will be defeated, based on all my 
conversations with the undecideds," Cranston said. "There is a feeling it is 
not the great emotional issue that some believe it to be." 
</P>
<P>
That apparently was not the feeling of proponents, however, as they contended 
that they had the momentum to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), warning that his proposed amendment 
can be used as an issue in this year's elections, pressed for an immediate 
Senate vote in the patriotic atmosphere of Flag Day. 
</P>
<P>
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) rebuffed the demand, but a spirited 
debate broke out across Capitol Hill in a flurry of speeches and press 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
At a "media event" on the Capitol lawn, Dole announced that his measure had 35 
Republican and 13 Democratic co-sponsors, including Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.). Many appeared with leaders of veterans' groups amid 10 flapping 
American flags and a placard bearing the words of the proposed amendment: 
</P>
<P>
"The Congress and the States shall have power to prohibit the physical 
desecration of the Flag of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to opponents' charges that the flag measure represents a dangerous 
threat to the First Amendment's protection of free expression, Dole said: 
"We're all here to do the right thing. We're not here to demagogue for anything 
or for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we believe in free speech and the First Amendment," Wilson said before a 
phalanx of TV cameras, "but conduct that desecrates the flag should not be 
dignified as political dissent." 
</P>
<P>
Although Democratic leaders are organizing opposition to the amendment, GOP 
Sen. John C. Danforth of Missouri captured widespread attention Thursday with a 
blistering attack that included criticism of both Bush and Dole. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the President had said that flag burning "endangers the fabric of 
our country," Danforth commented: "While it is reprehensible and repulsive and 
obnoxious and disgusting, in no way does it endanger the fabric of our country. 
Why is it that we do not have revolutions in the United States . . . ? What 
prevents the fabric from tearing is elasticity . . . . Anybody is free to 
express himself, and the answer to any self-styled revolutionary is, 'Say your 
piece . . . run for office if you want to. Then let the people vote.' That is 
the answer to revolutionaries." 
</P>
<P>
Danforth dismissed Dole's threat, directed at Democrats running for reelection, 
that opponents of the flag amendment would suffer from being targeted in 
negative TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the American people are going to say: 'We are not really 
threatened by these (flag-burning) crackpots. . . . And we want our Bill of 
Rights. We want our First Amendment,' " the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern Democrat, Sen. Terry Sanford of North Carolina, said that, as a 
paratrooper in World War II, he "jumped into combat with the flag on my left 
shoulder" to help preserve freedoms in the Bill of Rights. "You ask me now to 
damage that document in the name of political expediency so that somebody won't 
run a 30-second ad against me? Nothing doing." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) joined a parade of passionate proponents of the 
amendment. "If anyone wants to jump up and down and set their britches on fire 
to express themselves, they have that right," Gramm said. "But we simply ask 
that they not burn the symbol of the very nation on Earth that allows them to 
have all this freedom." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The House Judiciary Committee will vote Tuesday on a constitutional amendment 
against flag burning. On Thursday, the full House is expected to consider the 
measure, while the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on a similar 
proposal. The full Senate likely will act the week after next. If a measure is

STUDY SAYS B-2 CAN CARRY OUT ITS MISSION; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: BUT THE SECRET REPORT TO CONGRESS FAILS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
STEALTH BOMBER'S COST AND USEFULNESS. THE SOVIET RESPONSE ALSO IS UNKNOWN.

A classified study prepared for Congress concludes that the B-2 Stealth bomber 
probably will be capable of carrying out its intended mission of penetrating 
Soviet air defenses, but it leaves unanswered questions about the plane's 
steadily rising cost and what the Soviets are likely to do to counter it, 
sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department study, presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee 
in closed session Thursday, also does not address whether the plane's stated 
mission -- to attack Soviet command bunkers and mobile missiles -- is realistic 
in light of evolving superpower relations and emerging technology. 
</P>
<P>
The report was delivered shortly before Congress begins debate on the 1991 
defense budget and coincides with a chorus of criticism of the B-2 as overly 
expensive and potentially irrelevant. The aircraft, developed by Northrop Corp. 
of Los Angeles, is expected to cost $825 million per plane. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane is apparently very successful. It does what you want it to do," said 
a Senate aide familiar with the study's findings. "But this report doesn't look 
at cost and need. Those are political decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread misgivings about the B-2, Congress last year approved 
funding for the $62-billion program on the condition that the Defense 
Department report back periodically on a number of unresolved questions about 
the radar-evading bomber. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon was required to create an independent study panel of scientists 
from federally funded research centers to determine whether the B-2 can carry 
out its mission, whether that mission makes sense, what the Soviets are likely 
to do to defeat it, how long the plane will remain useful and whether it is 
worth the money. 
</P>
<P>
Only the first question was addressed in the report delivered Thursday. The 
panel is expected to present findings in the other areas later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The report assumes production of a fleet of 132 Stealth bombers, the number 
originally proposed by the Air Force. It does not assess the effectiveness of 
the reduced fleet of 75 planes that the Pentagon now plans to build. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists were given access to top secret Air Force data on the plane's 
design and to intelligence estimates on Soviet air-defense capabilities. The 
assessment of the bomber's performance was based on computer models and 
laboratory experiments rather than actual test-flight data. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice said in an interview Thursday that, although 
the plane has not been tested against real radar, "nothing that's gone on in 
any tests . . . gives us any reason to contradict the models." 
</P>
<P>
The panel reported to the Armed Services Committee that, given current and 
projected Soviet air defenses, the B-2 should be able to get through and attack 
its targets from close range with bombs and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The panel reportedly concluded that Soviet ground-based and air-based radar 
would not be able to detect the futuristic bomber, which the Air Force says has 
a radar "signature" no larger than that of an insect. 
</P>
<P>
However, the study said that some B-2s would be lost in a large-scale attack on 
the Soviet Union because they would be visually spotted by Soviet pilots or 
anti-aircraft crews. 
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear war fighting simply has no reality in an era of sharply declining 
tensions with the Soviet Union," said Henry W. Kendall, professor of physics at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and chairman of the Union of 
Concerned Scientists. "The B-2's mission is changing constantly. The program 
should be terminated promptly."

<P>
Pity Honduras. After sinking millions of foreign aid dollars into a dam, 
Central America's poorest country finds itself rich in electricity but unable 
to sell all the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, the region's most prosperous nation, is the logical customer. But 
between buyer and seller sits Nicaragua, with a power grid frayed by neglect 
and guerrilla sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, much of the electricity Honduras exports simply gets lost 
somewhere over Nicaragua. The Hondurans can charge only for what reaches Costa 
Rica. Nicaragua is too broke to fix its lines or pay for power itself. 
</P>
<P>
This waste of energy is a symptom of the physical and economic disintegration 
of Central America during the last decade of civil strife. It is the kind of 
problem the region's new leaders are eager to solve now that most of the 
fighting is over. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in six summit meetings since the so-called Esquipulas peace 
accord of August, 1987, the five Central American presidents who gather here 
Saturday and Sunday will focus mainly on economics. Having ended the Contra war 
in Nicaragua and coaxed the combatants in El Salvador and Guatemala to start 
talking peace, they will ask how they can help each other grow out of the 
poverty that fed those guerrilla conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
The time is ripe. El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica have 
installed elected civilian presidents in the last 12 months. These leaders 
share a conservative, technocratic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background 
</P>
<P>
As an ideological battleground, Central America got billions of superpower 
dollars during the 1980s, only to suffer what a U.N. report calls "an 
unprecedented social and economic crisis." Regional per capita income is down 
20% from 1978, the report says, and two of every five people live in "extreme 
poverty." Two million are refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The hope of the 1960s, the Central American Common Market, barely functions. 
Trade among the five countries has declined from $1.1 billion in 1981 to $600 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Regional agencies spawned by the Common Market have proposed an ambitious 
agenda for the five presidents. It calls for reviving the market, moving toward 
a single monetary system and setting up a joint "mechanism" to coordinate 
development projects and seek outside aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Central Americans ought to aspire to the total integration of this region as 
an economic unit if we really want to move ahead," said Guatemalan President 
Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, the only one of the five Esquipulas signatories still 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
A more united Central America -- the isthmus was a single federation, ruled 
from Guatemala, until 1838 -- is "something of a holy grail" for the region's 
statesmen, a foreign economist noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Obstacles 
</P>
<P>
But the rhetoric masks the same contradictions that derailed the Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
The market's trade barriers with the outside allowed El Salvador and Nicaragua 
to develop nascent industries and export manufactured goods within the region. 
Restoring such uniform protection could help them revive those industries, 
largely idled by war. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing such an inward-looking Common Market are Costa Rica and Honduras. They 
lost the early race to industrialize, became burdened by huge trade deficits 
and went their own way. 
</P>
<P>
Honduras abandoned the Common Market and got by on heavy doses of U.S. military 
and economic aid. Borrowing heavily from commercial banks, Costa Rica developed 
export markets outside Central America to become the region's only 1980s 
success story. 
</P>
<P>
But Costa Rica's economic record is not as envied as its democracy -- the model 
held up by its ex-president, Oscar Arias Sanchez, for the regional peace accord 
that he drafted. The cost of Costa Rica's painful belt-tightening to overcome a 
mid-1980s debt crisis probably exceeds what the more fragile neighboring 
democracies can pay. 
</P>
<P>
With Arias out of office, no one has stepped forward to lead the region. 
</P>
<P>
"In the peace process, everyone had a sense that by agreeing to the Arias 
rules, they would all benefit," said Albert Fishlow of the University of 
California at Berkeley. "On the economic side, you're talking about trade-offs 
between countries in terms of relative benefits from a new system. There is no 
acknowledged broker."

IN HUNGARY, LEARNING RUSSIAN IS OUT OF STYLE;

<P>
When the minister of education announced last fall that the teaching of Russian 
was no longer compulsory in Hungarian schools, students celebrated by shredding 
their Russian textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Russian was forced on us," student Krisztina Karoly, 20, told a reporter 
recently. "It will always be considered the language of oppression." 
</P>
<P>
She said that English is "suddenly very fashionable, but there is a big 
shortage of teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europeans have halted the teaching of Russian in keeping with their 
declarations of independence after four decades of political and cultural 
domination. But a linguistic vacuum has been created in the Soviets' wake. From 
Budapest to the Baltic Sea, the newly liberated millions are finding that they 
lack the voice to negotiate new alliances with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Russian-language teachers have been made redundant, 
compounding the emerging threat of unemployment and posing a challenge to 
Western democracies to help the East in its cultural -- as well as ideological 
-- transition. 
</P>
<P>
In Hungary, where the demand for language instruction is said to be greatest, 
small armies of American, British and German language teachers have jumped into 
the void seeking to make their mother tongue the language of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Young Hungarians appear to favor English, a language they have come to know 
through popular music, films and cable television. But a thirst for lucrative 
business ties with economically powerful West Germany has strengthened a 
historic bent for German, which is spoken along the border with Austria. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, traditional ties with the United States and its lingering aversion 
to German influence have established English as its uncontested medium for 
foreign contact. 
</P>
<P>
And in Czechoslovakia, its long border with German-speaking nations argues for 
that language. But the Czechoslovak ambassador to the United States, Rita 
Klimova, has appealed to Washington for help in preventing her country from 
being "Germanized" by hasty compacts with its prosperous neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Dropping Russian left "gaping holes in our curricula, and the question is, will 
they be filled by German or English?" Klimova said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Orr, a Budapest-based diplomat with the U.S. Information Service who is 
coordinating language exchanges for Eastern Europe, said: "Throughout the whole 
region, the turn away from the East and toward the West is most substantively 
manifested by the turning away from Russian and toward English. Russian 
teachers were practically ejected by force from the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Hungary alone has 8,000 Russian teachers in need of retraining, and the 
notoriously low pay offered public school teachers is making the crisis worse 
by driving skilled teachers into the booming commercial market. 
</P>
<P>
English- and German-speakers are in high demand as translators and tutors. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting public-school language gap will take years to overcome, but some 
Western nations have responded with new aid. 
</P>
<P>
The American Peace Corps recently signed an agreement with the Hungarian 
government to deploy 60 teachers of English in Hungary this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Soros Foundation, bankrolled by Hungarian emigre George 
Soros, has sponsored nearly 500 Hungarian teachers to learn English in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Eastern Europeans are concerned that U.S. involvement may be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungarians worry that the United States will tire of them," Orr observed. 
"This is the year of Eastern Europe. But next year could be the year of Central 
America or some other region that captures the moment."

As flower deliveries go, it was spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
A light plane swooped from the Soviet sky without warning and dropped off 
flowers for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at an airport near Turkey before 
zipping back across the frontier, Soviet media said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, at least some Soviets have gained a sense of humor since a 19-year-old 
West German youth buzzed the Kremlin and landed his Cessna on Red Square before 
startled KGB guards in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That young man, Mathias Rust, spent 14 months in a Soviet prison after the 
photo of his plane in front of St. Basil's Cathedral made front pages around 
the world. Soviet authorities fired their defense minister and air defense 
chief after Rust flew from Finland to a landing in Moscow undetected. 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident was reported in a mocking article in Izvestia under the 
headline, "Rust Number Two?" 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia and Tass, quoting the labor newspaper Trud, said that on June 9, a 
Cessna sneaked into Soviet airspace undetected by flying barely 600 feet above 
the mountainous southern border with Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
It touched down at the Batumi municipal airport for less than 40 seconds, just 
long enough to drop off a bouquet of carnations, greetings for Gorbachev, and a 
$20 bill. 
</P>
<P>
"We Germans are very grateful to him," said the note to Gorbachev. The author 
signed the note, "Hans Schneider." 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said air defenses "did not act," Izvestia reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Translating this into simple language, we dare to say this means they failed 
to notice him," the newspaper concluded. "Thank God, the second Rust had enough 
tact not to land at a military base!" 
</P>
<P>
Trud said that border guards and air defenders failed to coordinate their 
actions. It said helicopters should have pursued the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, he is still a violator, even though he has an excellent sense of 
humor," Trud said.

Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis said Thursday that he sees no sign 
yet of Moscow easing its economic sanctions against his breakaway republic 
despite reports that some natural gas deliveries would resume. 
</P>
<P>
"I checked yesterday and no one knew anything," Landsbergis said by telephone 
from the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be a red herring but we will see what the future brings. So far we 
have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke as the Baltic region marked a day of mourning for thousands of Balts 
interned by Soviet secret police after Moscow took control of Lithuania, Latvia 
and Estonia in 1940. The mass deportations were part of Josef Stalin's attempt 
to consolidate Soviet control over the republics annexed a year earlier under a 
secret agreement with Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said after talks 
with Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov that Moscow had agreed to ease 
the blockade it imposed after Lithuania's March 11 independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement heralded a possible breakthrough after three months of 
deadlock between Moscow and Lithuania over the Baltic republic's drive for 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
But many barriers to direct negotiations remained. 
</P>
<P>
The cutting of oil supplies and sharp reductions in natural gas deliveries have 
crippled Lithuanian industry. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene on Wednesday said that Moscow had agreed to resume some gas 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Lithuania would be willing to back down and accept President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's key demand that it should freeze its independence declaration, 
Landsbergis said: "We will debate everything that came out of yesterday's 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Lithuania has resolutely refused to discuss the issue of 
sovereignty.

White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu has accepted an invitation to go to 
Moscow to help Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev organize his office, a 
spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu already has been offering advice, meeting this week with a delegation of 
visiting Soviet officials who are interested in how the White House works. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Sununu was invited by a 
member of the group to visit Moscow and has accepted. The date of his trip has 
not been set. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Sununu will advise Gorbachev on organizational matters related 
to the executive office of the President. Gorbachev was elected to the new post 
of president this year, in addition to his position as general secretary of the 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they would like him to come to the Soviet Union to take a look at 
their ideas and their plans and see if he has any advice," Fitzwater said.

AIR FORCE SEEKING NEW WORLDWIDE ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: SHIFTING FROM EMPHASIS ON NUCLEAR MISSIONS AND EUROPE, THE STRATEGY 
WILL FOCUS ON POSSIBLE 3RD WORLD TARGETS.

<P>
The Air Force, facing deep budget reductions and challenges to its mission, 
plans today to unveil a report that touts its ability to strike quickly at 
distant Third World targets, seen as a strong defense priority of the future. 
</P>
<P>
The statement to be released by Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice marks a 
decided shift from the Air Force's longstanding emphasis on long-range nuclear 
missions and conventional warfare in Europe. The new tack stresses rapid 
operations that would "reach out and touch someone" anywhere at a moment's 
notice, in the words of the service's senior officer, Gen. Larry D. Welch. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which promotes the service's "unique characteristics" for 
futuristic warfare, offers a glimpse of the behind-the scenes competition 
between the Air Force and the Navy for a pre-eminent military role as the end 
of the Cold War sharply threatens defense budgets and the need for many 
traditional operations. 
</P>
<P>
It offers a sweeping view of how the Air Force intends to redefine itself in 
the face of a scaling back that likely will trim its current force of 541,000 
to as few as 460,000 by 1995. The service's new emphasis on potential threats 
outside Europe attempts to counter a secretary of defense and Congress 
increasingly skeptical of the service's costly programs, such as the B-2 
bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Among some outside critics, there have even been suggestions that the Air 
Force, the youngest of the four military services, could be abolished, with the 
Navy and the Army taking up the air-power slack. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, which has long promoted itself as the caretaker of the nation's most 
effective arsenal for a Third World strike, has aggressively positioned itself 
as the premier service to handle brush-fire wars of the future. With at least 
two of its 14 carriers threatened by budget cuts, the Navy has cited its 
ability to strike distant targets quickly without access to foreign bases. 
</P>
<P>
In its new report, the Air Force makes a bid for a full share of that mission. 
It also advertises some old missions, such as surveillance by satellite and 
aircraft, as prime ones for watching developing nations where threats could 
develop quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Further, it notes that it can help the United States make new global friends 
and influence allies by transferring aircraft that are being retired because of 
budget reductions. The Air Force said that the recent shipment of older Air 
Force jets to Colombia, where they will be used in that country's drug 
interdiction efforts, is an example of how the service can help Washington 
"influence events and protect national interests in areas where more visible 
means of intervention are not viable." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the recasting more evident than in the evolving rationale for the 
$62-billion B-2 Stealth bomber. The B-2 was designed as an intercontinental 
bomber that would penetrate Soviet airspace. But the new Air Force report 
points out that in instances such as the 1986 raid on Libya, six B-2 bombers 
could do the work of the 119 aircraft and 20 ships that took part in that 
operation -- and probably do it more cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers have jeered at the suggestion that the United States would use 
an $825 million-per-copy plane for such missions. 
</P>
<P>
"There are obviously differences of opinion about the political salability of 
the conventional mission for the B-2," Rice conceded in an interview Thursday 
with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Would we have bought the B-2 just for that? Probably not," Rice added. "But 
the plane will probably be more valuable in the future than it would have in 
the past. We'll find as time unfolds many uses" for the aircraft.

In the tiny Texas town of Whitewright, hard on the Oklahoma border, a scandal 
is brewing in which a man who raised prize orchids and ran a hardware store 
before his death 10 years ago may have been the perpetrator of one of the 
largest art thefts ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Joe T. Meador, by all accounts a quiet, unassuming man who served 
honorably in World War II and ended his service stationed in what is now East 
Germany in 1945. His unit was in charge of guarding a mine shaft that contained 
some of the world's most valuable art objects, hidden there at the time for 
safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and a West German investigator are now 
looking to a bank vault in Meador's hometown of Whitewright, population 1,800, 
as the place where the treasures might at last be recovered. The investigation 
was disclosed Thursday by the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to Texas to try to put some more nails in some coffins," said Willi 
Korte, the German investigator, in a telephone interview. "I have been to 
Whitewright before, and it wasn't because Triple-A recommended it." 
</P>
<P>
The first break in the case occurred last April, when, for a $3-million 
"finder's fee," one of the missing works was returned to a West German 
foundation, with the stipulation that the names of the sellers, as well as the 
name of the lawyer who negotiated the deal, would never be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the deal was cut for the artwork -- a 9th-Century jewel-encrusted, 
illustrated manuscript of the Four Gospels -- a spokesman for the foundation 
said the manuscript was taken to Texas by an American GI at the end of the war. 
That and other treasures were hidden in the mine shaft near Quedlinburg, a 
medieval castle town in Saxony-Anhault Province. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement for the manuscript was carried out in Switzerland, where such 
sales are protected by law. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy report in the New York Times pointed to Meador as the thief and his 
heirs as the people who arranged for the sale of the manuscript. Numerous calls 
to the relatives elicited a string of "no comments." The lawyer named as the 
intermediary in the transaction, John S. Torigian, left word that he would be 
taking depositions for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the bank where the remainder of the treasures are purportedly 
being kept would not discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Mike Satimauro of the Dallas office said the matter is under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're intent on getting a better handle on what's supposed to be missing," he 
said. "We're trying to see if we do, in fact, have stolen articles and, if we 
do, we will do our best to get them back." 
</P>
<P>
While the FBI is investigating, the town of Whitewright went into an absolute 
swoon Thursday. Television crews in helicopters flashed overhead and the 
telephones never seemed to stop ringing. 
</P>
<P>
"This has thrown us into an uproar," said Mayor Clarence Tillett. "The whole 
town will be talking about this for some time to come. There's 1,800 people 
here and people usually know what's going on with everyone else in town. But I 
can tell you, all of us were surprised about this news about Joe Meador." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Kennealy, the chief of police, said: "Nobody knows anything about this." 
</P>
<P>
Korte, the investigator, said these kinds of thefts usually follow a similar 
pattern, in which art was taken, the thief dies and the heirs try to cash in on 
the treasure. In this case, the family members allegedly consulted with a 
number of experts about two manuscripts. Most of the experts told the family 
that the manuscripts probably were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not a whole lot of sophistication, or they wouldn't have exposed 
themselves by having so many appraisals," Korte said. "I hope the family has 
some valuable information and some additional items." 
</P>
<P>
Korte said his first nibble came early this year, when word went out through 
the art world that one of the manuscripts could be had for the $3-million 
finder's fee. That was two years after the first word that the Quedlinburg 
treasures might be for sale, for the right price. 
</P>
<P>
"The offer clearly smelled like it was coming out of the U.S.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Korte was somewhat circumspect about how the field was narrowed to 
Whitewright, he said documents at the National Archives had been extremely 
beneficial. He said he had been looking for an officer to be the thief. Meador 
was a lieutenant when the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
He said experience had shown that most such postwar thefts were "under the eyes 
of an American officer or with the participation of an American officer." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Meador, who had studied art in college, came back to Whitewright 
after his father became ill. By all accounts, he led a very normal life, 
waiting on people at the hardware store and raising orchids in the three 
greenhouses behind the family home. He never married. At graduation time, 
Meador provided free orchids to the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Hasty, one of the pallbearers at Meador's funeral, said Thursday: "I 
heard from several people that Joe used to bring those manuscripts in the 
hardware store once in a while and left them laying right out there on the 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus in town is he didn't know the value of them. If he did, I don't 
think he would have laid them out on a counter in a hardware store downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Times researcher Lianne Hart contributed to this story.

A convicted burglar can be ordered to pay for a burglar alarm for his victims 
as part of restitution, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled. The victimized 
couple had told the trial court that the Nov. 13, 1987, burglary was traumatic, 
forcing the woman to seek medical care and prompting them to install the alarm 
system to ease their fears.

A bomb exploded Thursday at the Cuban Museum of Arts and Culture, causing 
extensive damage but no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI said the attack was the latest in a series of terrorist bombings 
apparently committed by a group of anti-Castro militants. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, which has been at the center of a political controversy within 
Miami's large Cuban community, was rocked by the explosion at 1:09 a.m., FBI 
agent Paul Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the device was more powerful than those used in similar bombings 
that have rocked Miami's Cuban community in the past.

Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan Thursday took his 
anti-smoking crusade on the road, appealing to older Americans, many of whom 
have been puffing on cigarettes for decades. 
</P>
<P>
It is "never too late to stop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said that the federal government will start a special public service 
campaign in the fall, complete with mass mailings to doctors, television 
commercials and celebrity endorsements, to help Americans over the age of 50 
"quit that horrible habit." 
</P>
<P>
"Your body can repair much of the damage smoking has done," Sullivan told 
delegates to the biennial convention of the American Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-million-member AARP will join Sullivan's department and another Cabinet 
agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs, in the drive. 
</P>
<P>
With budget stringency preventing development of major new spending programs, 
Sullivan has adopted the smoking issue as a high-profile campaign for the huge 
federal department he heads. 
</P>
<P>
"You may know that I have helped our community groups oppose tobacco company 
plans to market new cigarettes to blacks as well as young white females as well 
as existing brands to sports fans and to minors," Sullivan told the delegates. 
"Now, it is your turn." 
</P>
<P>
R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. abandoned a major investment in a proposed brand, 
Uptown, aimed at black consumers, after Sullivan assailed the company in 
January. A day after his speech, in which Sullivan accused the company of 
"slick and sinister" efforts to promote "the culture of cancer," Reynolds 
dropped its plan to test market the new cigarette in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Uptown was a mentholated cigarette, aimed at black smokers. About 75% of black 
smokers use mentholated brands, compared with only 23% of white smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan also chastised Reynolds after it was disclosed that the company was 
considering marketing plans for a brand to be called Dakota, aimed at 
uneducated young white women between the ages of 18 and 24. Sullivan has 
mounted a continuous broadside of criticism against the tobacco industry, 
including a charge that sports events are taking "blood money" by allowing 
sponsorship by cigarette producers. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said that more than 13 million people 50 and older smoke, but 
two-thirds of them say they want to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"Some older Americans who smoked for decades may think that the damage smoking 
does to their bodies cannot be reversed," he said. "I am here to tell you that 
such thinking is wrong -- dead wrong. It is never too late to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said that even those who have smoked for nearly 50 years can add to 
their longevity by quitting. "Your body can repair much of the damage smoking 
has done if you stop." 
</P>
<P>
The functions of the heart and the blood circulation begin to improve within 
months after a person stops using cigarettes, the secretary said. A year after 
a smoker quits, "the extra risk of dying from a heart attack caused by smoking 
is gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan told the delegates that "smokers who have diseases like emphysema and 
bronchitis also have hope if they stop smoking, because those conditions will 
stabilize and get no worse -- once a smoker stops." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the massive wave of publicity since the 1964 surgeon general's report 
linking lung cancer and smoking, millions of people are still unaware of the 
threat, Sullivan told a news conference after his convention speech. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of low-income Americans either do not know or do not believe that 
smoking endangers their health, he said. More than 400,000 people a year die 
from diseases linked to smoking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign will make a special effort to reach doctors through mailings, 
contacts with professional societies and communications to hospital staffs. The 
drive will be started in late September, linked to a special report by the 
surgeon general on the benefits of quitting smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan told the AARP delegates, whose membership age ranges from 50 to the 
90s, that "older smokers who stop will sleep better and breathe better. They 
will walk farther without running out of breath." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said also that his department will step up its efforts to detect and 
punish abuse of older Americans. New regulations for nursing homes receiving 
federal funds will become effective Oct. 1. "We will require stronger reporting 
investigations, resolution and follow-up of abuse incidents in nursing homes 
that want to continue as Medicare or Medicaid providers," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the House Committee on Aging indicated that there has been a 
substantial increase in physical abuse, violence and mistreatment against older 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the states to report abuse convictions for possible sanctions" against 
nursing homes, Sullivan told the delegates. 
</P>
<P>
The government can levy fines against nursing homes in which abuse takes place 
or bar the institutions from participating in federally financed programs. 
</P>
<P>
"To abuse an elderly person, whether at home or in a nursing home, is an 
inhuman act," Sullivan said. "It is a crime pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Emboldened by passage of a smoking ban on virtually all domestic airline 
flights, tobacco foes in Congress are targeting cigarette marketing practices. 
Congress last acted on cigarette advertising in 1984, when it adopted the 
current series of rotating label warnings. New proposals would bar the use of 
alluring models and other imagery in cigarette ads and create a federally 
funded education and media campaign to warn of smoking's dangers.

SENATE PASSES PLAN TO SPEED SPENDING BILLS

Hoping to speed consideration of congressional spending bills, the Senate 
passed a limited budget plan Thursday that does not say how any of the $503 
billion in fiscal year 1991 discretionary spending would be used. 
</P>
<P>
The scaled-back Senate budget plan, passed on a voice vote, was needed to help 
appropriations panels begin their work without impeding the congressional and 
Administration budget talks on a fiscal 1991 budget package. Those talks 
continued Thursday with no reported progress. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate budget plan, which calls for $503 billion in discretionary spending 
next year in all categories, including defense, is considered "policy neutral" 
because it does not direct how much money will be spent for any government 
function. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriations committees will decide that later. 
</P>
<P>
The limited Senate budget now goes to a conference committee with the House, 
which on May 1 passed a spending plan containing $513 billion in defense and 
domestic discretionary spending as part of a larger $1.2-trillion spending 
package for fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The House budget cuts defense spending levels below what President Bush 
requested in the budget he submitted in January and calls for spending $6 
billion on domestic initiatives that Bush did not propose. 
</P>
<P>
Despite passage by voice vote, some opposition was noted on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
"With passage of this resolution, it's one more step toward (another) year of 
drift," said Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.). 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) indicated the House would 
not accept the Senate's budget approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not opposed to it for the Senate," Foley said. "I'm not ready to agree to 
that conclusion for the (House-Senate) conference" to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
Under its rules, the House can begin consideration of spending bills for the 
following year once it has adopted a budget resolution. But the Senate cannot 
begin work on its spending bills until House and Senate negotiators agree on a 
budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders felt it was important to clear the way for routine 
consideration of spending bills in case budget summit negotiators fail to reach 
an agreement.

BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT ADVANCES; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: A SENATE PANEL ACTS TO ADD THE SPENDING RULE TO THE CONSTITUTION. A 
CLOSE VOTE IS EXPECTED, AND THE MEASURE'S FATE IN THE HOUSE IS UNCERTAIN.

<P>
Acting with bipartisan support, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11 to 3 
Thursday for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that would forbid 
federal deficit spending unless approved by 60% majorities in the House and 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed constitutional change, which is supported by President Bush, would 
also require the President to submit to Congress a federal budget with 
projected outlays below the level of expected revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Before it can take effect, however, the measure must be approved by two-thirds 
majorities in both the Senate and the House and be ratified by 38 of the 50 
states, a difficult process that few proposed amendments have survived. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved a similar amendment in 1982, but it never made it through 
the House. In 1986, the same amendment fell one vote short of passage in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear when the full Senate would vote on the measure approved by the 
Judiciary Committee, but both sides said that they expected a close vote. The 
measure's prospects in the House are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), chief sponsor of the legislation, noted that the 
federal government last balanced its budget in 1969 and that the national debt 
since has climbed over the $3-trillion mark. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time we put a stop to this," said Simon, who is facing a reelection 
fight this year. "We've tried legislative solutions . . . and it's time we made 
fiscal responsibility a part of the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said that the President and Congress could enact a balanced budget 
without changing the Constitution. "We don't need a constitutional amendment," 
said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). "We need some political courage." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has called for passage of the amendment, even though he submitted a budget 
initially projecting a $64-billion deficit for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 
1. In recent months, the estimated deficit has escalated to at least $160 
billion and could reach $200 billion, the President's advisers have said. 
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee acted as the President's representatives and leading 
members of Congress concluded their fourth week of budget summit talks without 
any sign of agreement on a deficit-cutting package. 
</P>
<P>
They plan additional meetings on Tuesday to hear a report from Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney on estimated savings from a 25% reduction in U.S. 
military spending for weapons and troops. Summit participants also plan to 
discuss government revenues, including the sensitive topic of tax increases, 
before starting to negotiate on possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the end of the dance now, and we've got to start making decisions," 
said Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), ranking Republican member of the House Budget 
Committee. Frenzel said that he believes the negotiators should conclude an 
agreement and present it to Congress for approval before the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), however, said in a Senate speech that he believes it 
might be months before the budget discussions produce an agreement -- possibly 
requiring a lame-duck session of Congress after the November elections.

Saudi Arabia's King Fahd was quoted Thursday as saying he wants to end disputes 
between his conservative kingdom and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"With Iran in particular, we have not rejected the principle of improving the 
atmosphere with them, but we even (want) to eliminate all causes for the 
current dispute," he told the Saudi newspaper Okaz in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Relations reached a new low after Iran said it would boycott July's Muslim 
pilgrimage to Mecca for the third year because of quota restrictions imposed by 
Saudi Arabia.

SACRAMENTO FILE: TORRES' PROPOSAL FOR STATE-RUN AIRLINE CRASHES, BURNS IN VOTE 
</P>

<P>
Sen. Art Torres' ambitious plan to put the state of California in the business 
of running a passenger airline crashed on the runway in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Spawned by what the Los Angeles Democrat deplored as "outrageous" commercial 
air fares and inconvenient schedules, his bill (SB 2900) received only 13 
favorable votes of the 27 required for approval by the Senate. Twenty-one 
senators voted no. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, the notion of a state-operated airline, flying primarily 
between Sacramento and Southern California, was given little chance of becoming 
law, particularly in the face of heavy opposition from the influential airline 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
At the state Capitol, the Torres proposal was regarded chiefly as a device to 
prod the airlines into cutting back on fares and adopting more convenient 
schedules in California. The proposal for a nonprofit, state-operated airline 
suggested less costly and more passenger-oriented air travel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're suckers for the airline industry," Torres told the Senate. "It's time 
California raised its eyebrows and said enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
But an opponent, freshman Sen. Charles Calderon (D-Whittier), told Torres that 
while "it's cute to discuss the issue . . . we ought to consider addressing 
some of the more serious problems facing the state." 
</P>

COURT UPHOLDS KILLER'S DEATH SENTENCE; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: A 6-1 DECISION REJECTS AN APPEAL BY A SANTA ANA MAN. HE WAS CONVICTED 
IN THE 1983 RAPE AND FATAL STABBING OF A BANK TELLER OUTSIDE A GARDEN GROVE 
BAR.

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the death sentence of a Santa Ana 
man convicted in the rape and frenzied fatal stabbing of a Norwalk bank teller 
outside a Garden Grove bar in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a 6-1 decision, turned down an appeal by Richard Raymond 
Ramirez, 31, a thrice-convicted felon found guilty in the murder of Kimberly 
Gonzalez, 22. Ramirez is not the Richard Ramirez sentenced to death for the 
series of "Night Stalker" murders in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, the high court acknowledged in a majority opinion by 
Justice Allen Broussard that there were procedural errors in the case but 
concluded that they were not significant enough to overturn the conviction and 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, the court said, the prosecutor was improperly allowed to 
cross-examine Ramirez's mother and elicit admissions about the defendant's 
criminal record as a juvenile and his use of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Such questions went beyond the scope of the mother's previous testimony for the 
defense about the family's troubled home life and thus was inadmissible, the 
justices said. But the incidents she related were "relatively innocuous" 
compared to the other evidence of criminal activity the jury properly heard, 
Broussard wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
The justices also said the trial judge, in upholding the jury's recommendation 
of death, had erred in considering a probation report that referred to parts of 
Ramirez's criminal record that had not been presented to jurors. 
</P>
<P>
But in making his decision, the judge relied primarily on evidence that was 
placed properly before the jury and the incidents in the report did not play a 
significant role in his ruling, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin found that 
the factors favoring the death penalty clearly outweighed the factors against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's body, containing 19 stab wounds, was found early on the morning of 
Nov. 21, 1983. Ramirez, who was on parole after previous convictions for 
forcible rape, possession of a concealed weapon and receiving stolen property, 
admitted leaving the bar with Gonzalez but he denied killing her. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution presented evidence showing Ramirez's fingerprints were on a 
beer bottle found near the body and offered testimony from a woman Ramirez had 
raped at knife-point in 1977. She said Ramirez cut her face in the same way 
Gonzalez was cut. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of murder, rape 
and sodomy. But in the penalty phase of the case, the jury deadlocked 11 to 1 
in favor of a death sentence, forcing a mistrial. Another jury, convened for a 
penalty retrial, voted unanimously for a verdict of death. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas M. Goethals, the former deputy district attorney who prosecuted Ramirez, 
called it a difficult case to prove in court but "a very strong case" for 
prosecutors on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Goethals called it "a brutal crime" that might never have been solved except 
for a beer bottle found near the victim's body in an alley behind the bar. 
Ramirez had been seen with her inside the bar, but no one saw them afterward. 
However, Ramirez's fingerprints were found on the bottle, proving to jurors 
that he had been in the alley with her. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors sought a death verdict against Ramirez based on his four prior 
felony convictions, one of them for rape.

STATE SUPREME COURT DEFERS HEARING ON CRIME INITIATIVE 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday refused, at least for now, to hear a broad 
constitutional attack on Proposition 115, the far-reaching anti-crime 
initiative approved by the voters June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the justices, in a brief order, directed a state Court of Appeal in 
Los Angeles to review a legal challenge brought by the Los Angeles County 
public defender seeking to block implementation of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication of when the appeals court would act on the 
suit. But whichever way that court rules, the issue is all but certain to 
return to the state high court for final resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case now came as a disappointment to 
Assistant Public Defender David Meyer, who noted that there are hundreds of 
criminal cases in California -- their number growing by the day -- whose fate 
awaits the outcome of the court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, known as the Crime Victims Justice Reform Act, amended the 
state Constitution to limit the rights of criminal defendants to those required 
by the U.S. Supreme Court under the federal Constitution. The measure also 
called for a series of changes in state law aimed at reducing delay in criminal 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, brought by Public Defender Wilbur F. Littlefield, sought a 
high-court order preventing the initiative from taking effect and a ruling 
declaring the measure unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contended that the wide-ranging initiative violated a provision 
limiting ballot measures to a "single subject." Also, the suit said, the 
proposition was so sweeping in impact that it amounted to a "revision" of the 
Constitution and thus could not be enacted by initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Of more immediate concern was the suit's further contention that even if the 
initiative were held constitutional, it still could not be applied to cases 
pending at the time it was approved by the voters, but only to cases involving 
crimes committed after the approval. 
</P>
<P>
Littlefield's suit argued that such application is barred by the initiative's 
own terms -- which make no mention of retroactive application -- as well as the 
retroactivity prohibitions of the state and federal Constitutions.

ANAHEIM BOY ARRESTED AFTER HIS SISTER, 12, IS SHOT IN HEAD

<P>
A 14-year-old boy who told police that three armed robbers broke into his 
family's house and shot his 12-year-old sister in the head was arrested 
Thursday on suspicion of attempted murder, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy allegedly made up the story after shooting his sister with a small 
caliber rifle in her upstairs bedroom, Anaheim police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was not identified because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect's sister was taken to the UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange where 
she was in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. Her parents, James 
and Marie Hubler, were at the hospital but declined to discuss the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"During the investigation, it was determined that the boy was alone with his 
sister" at the time of the shooting, Police Lt. John Cross said. Minutes before 
the girl was shot, the boy apparently had been target shooting in his back 
yard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators declined to say why they believe the boy shot his sister. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they arrived at the family's two-story beige stucco house in the 
1900 block of West Bayshore Drive about 12:35 p.m. after receiving a call about 
a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor said he heard three gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one shot, and then another about five minutes later, and then one 
about 15minutes later," said the neighbor, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Police took the boy to Orange County Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the second time in three weeks that a juvenile was shot in the 
head by a teen-ager in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
On May 24, Christian Wiedepuhl, 17, was fatally shot with a .38-caliber pistol 
by a classmate in Anaheim Hills. The Orange County district attorney is 
reviewing the case to determine if manslaughter charges should be filed.

GARAMENDI WILL HEAD NEW SENATE COMMITTEE ON INSURANCE

<P>
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday gave a boost to Sen. John Garamendi's 
public exposure as the Democratic nominee for state insurance commissioner by 
creating a new fact-finding insurance committee for him to head. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi said the new Senate Select Committee on the Department of Insurance 
as a Consumer Protection Agency, empowered to hold hearings statewide, will 
examine the department's performance on such matters as rate regulation, 
consumer complaints and consumer information. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will be in addition to the Senate's permanent Insurance, Claims 
and Corporations Committee, which traditionally deals not only with insurance 
legislation but with other issues relating to the Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi, of Walnut Grove, faces Republican nominee Wes Bannister in the 
general election campaign for the new elective post of insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), Rules Committee 
chairman, denied that creating the committee would provide Garamendi with a 
taxpayer-financed platform from which to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll have to restrict himself to legislative policy," Roberti insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi said he proposed the committee to the Rules Committee and said he 
would "vigorously" hold public hearings into what he called the "current 
inadequacies of the (insurance) department." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said the committee was being created less than two weeks after 
Garamendi won the Democratic primary election because of the "high volatility 
of the insurance industry . . . and it is time that we start looking at new 
(Proposition 103) regulations and how they are being implemented by the 
department." 
</P>
<P>
The 23 "select" committees of the Senate do not act on legislation but examine 
topics ranging from the California wine industry and mobile homes to the 
Pacific Rim and Northern California watersheds. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi, now the only member of the new committee, resigned his post as 
chairman of the Revenue and Taxation Committee. He was succeeded by Sen. Wadie 
P. Deddeh (D-Chula Vista).

LEECH IS USED TO SAVE FINGER; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: A SURGEON APPLIES AN UNAESTHETIC BUT AGE-OLD REMEDY TO AID IN 
CIRCULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When modern surgical techniques failed to restore circulation to a reattached 
finger, a Camarillo surgeon turned this week to an age-old remedy: the leech. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lorenzo Giles Walker worked for three hours in surgery at Pleasant Valley 
Hospital Monday to repair an Oxnard man's three crushed fingers, one of which 
had been left hanging by its skin after a forklift accident. 
</P>
<P>
Walker reattached arteries, tendons and nerves, repaired bones and stitched 
together skin on three fingers. But the survival of the ring finger, which had 
been most seriously damaged, was in question at the end of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had done a pretty good anastomosis on this guy," Walker said 
Thursday, referring to the procedure. "But yet his finger wouldn't turn pink. I 
was upset." 
</P>
<P>
Laureano Topete, 24, of Oxnard was in danger of losing his finger because of 
poor circulation, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, blood began to flow into the finger, indicating that the reattached 
artery was working. But before Walker could relax, the pink finger began to 
turn purple, a sign that the blood had no route out of the finger. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Walker, trained at Harvard Medical School, decided to call in the 
leeches. He had learned the technique in 1988 and 1989 during a fellowship at 
UCLA Medical Center, where the technique is practiced routinely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker ordered 20 leeches at $6 each from Leeches USA, a New York company that 
has shipped more than 10,000 of the worms to medical centers nationwide since 
the company began in 1986. The company dispatched the water-packed creatures by 
Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
Leeches -- the blood-sucking slugs that attached to Humphrey Bogart in the 
"African Queen" -- perform two functions that modern medicine cannot duplicate: 
They can thin blood in a localized area, and they can cause blood to ooze for 
hours after the puncture, said Marie Bonazinga, president of Leeches USA. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously if there were a more aesthetic method that worked, we would use it," 
Walker said Thursday. "But there is no technological substitute for the leech." 
</P>
<P>
When Walker first told Topete that he would use leeches to help heal the 
injury, Topete's reaction, like the man, was good-natured. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was joking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Topete, who patiently answered questions at a press conference Thursday, posed 
with a leech for photographers. Smiling, his pain dulled by a constant supply 
of Valium, Topete said he was unperturbed by the thought of a slippery worm 
sucking his blood. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my friend," he said, playfully stroking the worm as it prepared to 
attach itself to Topete's good hand before a nurse snatched it away with a pair 
of tweezers. 
</P>
<P>
"I like animals," Topete said. "I think that's great that an animal was helping 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Topete said he was finishing his shift driving a forklift at a Ventura County 
office in Camarillo about 2 p.m. Monday when the lift got caught in the roof of 
a building. When he tried to free it, the lift slid down and caught his 
fingers. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't sure he still had his fingers immediately after the accident. But on 
Thursday, Walker predicted an 80% likelihood that Topete will keep the fingers, 
thanks to the leeches. 
</P>
<P>
Another few days should tell, Walker said. Meanwhile, the 32-year-old doctor 
will check frequently on his patient and continue to apply the leeches up to 
twice a day until Topete's blood circulation is restored. 
</P>
<P>
"You worry about these things," he said. "It's like a child."

CONSULTANT WAS HIRED DESPITE COST, WARNINGS 
</P>

<P>
The company conducting a management audit for Oxnard was hired even though its 
rates were more than three times higher than those of the lowest bidder, and it 
had a history of recommending drastic cuts in police and fire services, city 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are hoping that the report by Cresap Management Consultants will 
point out ways to reduce Oxnard's projected $2.8-million budget deficit without 
forcing them to make drastic cuts in services and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the City Council started discussing ways to avoid the 
deficit, but decided to delay budget decisions until the report is released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But some officials have warned that Cresap has a reputation for recommending 
deep cuts in police and fire services, instead of coming up with less drastic 
ways to pare a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann Johs said Thursday that she recommended Cresap despite a 
warning that the firm had received mixed reviews in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Before the council hired Cresap in February, Johs said Police Chief Robert 
Owens warned her that the Washington-based firm had a history of recommending 
drastic cuts in public safety departments. But Johs said she shrugged off the 
warning as an attempt to avoid police layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Johs and Councilwomen Dorothy Maron and Geraldine (Gerry) Furr voted to hire 
the firm, and Mayor Nao Takasugi and Councilman Manuel Lopez voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
Cresap was hired despite objections from Takasugi and Lopez, who said the rates 
charged by the firm are more than three times higher than those of the lowest 
bidder for the service. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Lopez said it was a mistake for the city to pay 
Cresap $250,000 for the audit when another firm offered to do the job for 
$70,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We were out of our gourd to select them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cresap Vice President Bill Evans could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
However, a press statement released Thursday said Cresap has been a reputable 
company since it started doing business more than 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cresap was originally scheduled to complete the audit by May 30 but asked and 
was granted an extension until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi publicly criticized Cresap last month for suggesting in private 
conversations that the city cut 41 positions in the Police Department and 18 
positions in the Fire Department, close two fire stations and sell some city 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said Owens had warned him about Cresap's reputation but he said he could 
not remember if he talked to Owens before or after the Cresap contract was 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
Owens declined to discuss the matter Thursday, saying he did not want to 
publicly discuss his private conversations with the council. 
</P>
<P>
Johs said she recommended the firm to the council after hearing Evans speak at 
a California League of Cities meeting last year. She acknowledged that Cresap 
has received mixed reviews in some cities but said the company also has 
received praise from many other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of cities have called and hired them back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the higher rates charged by Cresap, Johs said the company's experience 
and reputation are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"They were head and shoulders above all the other candidates," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi, who said he voted against Cresap because of the high costs, said he 
had never talked to Owens about the firm's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The council chose Cresap after another auditing firm it hired for $80,000 
included Cresap in a list of three finalists. Maron and Furr said they relied 
on the recommendations and did not personally investigate Cresap. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Fong, personnel director for the city of Stockton, said Cresap received 
mixed reviews after it completed a comprehensive efficiency study of that city 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people said they did a wonderful job, others said they did a lousy job," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cresap was criticized by some Stockton officials for recommending personnel 
cuts in that city's Police Department, which were implemented at the time, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If their job was to examine our efficiency and make changes, they did their 
job," he said. "But some people would say they cut the heart out of the Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
In Flint, Mich., Cresap was hired in 1987 to study a morale problem in the 
Police Department and review the efficiency of its foot patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin McKree, a former Flint councilman who voted to hire Cresap, said the 
firm also received mixed reviews after it proposed ending the foot patrols. He 
said most of the recommendations that were implemented saved the city money 
despite concerns from citizens about safety.

TRENDS: RENTED LIMOUSINES ARE THE NEWEST FAD FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the last day of school Thursday at De Anza Middle School in Ventura, Shelley 
Garduno and seven of her classmates -- all dressed to the nines -- hopped into 
a white stretch limousine for a cruise up the coast and a late lunch in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
As classes ended at De Anza and many schools across Ventura County Thursday, a 
number of other eighth-grade students, imitating their high school elders, were 
whisked from campus in chauffeured limousines. 
</P>
<P>
The rented limos have become the newest fad for graduating eighth-graders in 
Ventura County -- an expensive luxury touch that some parents and school 
officials view as a dangerous new trend. 
</P>
<P>
At De Anza, after a morning of yearbook signing and a midday dance, two stretch 
limousines pulled curbside to pick up 13- and 14-year-old passengers. Several 
other students said they were being picked up by limousines at homes later in 
the afternoon for dinner and a drive. 
</P>
<P>
At Anacapa Middle School in Ventura, a limousine picked up a gaggle of 
eighth-grade girls for an afternoon drive and a possible trip to a fast-food 
restaurant, Principal Charlotte McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
"They all just crammed into the limousine and took off," McElroy said. "I asked 
them what they were going to do and they said just drive around. Something was 
mentioned about driving to McDonald's. I'd like to see that limousine at the 
drive-through window." 
</P>
<P>
At Anacapa's school dance earlier this week, McElroy said, a dozen limousines 
deposited eighth-graders and then parked outside, waiting to pick students up 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to explain to youngsters that not everybody can afford to do that," 
McElroy said. "But you have parents who come by and say, 'We understand that, 
but this is my child, and that's what I want to do for them.' " 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, students or their parents pay as much as $300 for a three-hour 
limousine ride. Often, groups of students get together and split the cost 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
At De Anza, Garduno and seven other students paid $28 apiece to rent a stretch 
limousine for three hours Thursday. And De Anza eighth-grade graduate Carlos 
Martinez said he had split the cost of a limousine with eight other students, 
for about $20 each. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just for fun," Martinez said. "It's a fun thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
John Raftery, owner of Executive Limousine Service in Ventura, said his 
underage clientele has increased significantly in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very big thing now for junior high school kids," Raftery said. "Most 
pay for it themselves. They bring in their money in ones and fives and tens, 
like they've been saving up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Executive Limousine rented limousines to at least five groups of junior 
high-age students Thursday afternoon and Thursday night, he said. The company 
requires parents' permission to drive minors out of town, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While renting limousines at graduation time has been popular among high school 
students for years, school officials say the practice has only recently become 
a trend at junior highs and has caused concern. 
</P>
<P>
In the Simi Valley Unified School District, concern about ninth-grade students 
spending exorbitant sums of money on graduation dances, dresses, tuxedos and 
limousines is one reason a district task force recommended restructuring the 
entire school system. 
</P>
<P>
The reconfiguration plan for Simi Valley calls for changing junior high schools 
from a seventh- through ninth-grade configuration to a middle school concept, 
typically sixth- through eighth-grades. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage kids to be their own age," spokeswoman Pamela Spencer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents are against the practice of renting limos for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's insane," said parent Sharon Gasner, adding that while she 
discouraged her daughter, an eighth-grade student at Los Altos Intermediate 
School in Camarillo, from spending a lot of money on graduation, other students 
and parents seem to do so without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's really sad and takes away from the excitement for when you become 
a senior," Gasner said. 
</P>
<P>
De Anza Assistant Principal Trudy Arriaga said her school also discourages it. 
"We try to be low-key," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, at De Anza's dance Thursday, most students wore shorts and sneakers or 
suits and dresses, and afterward were picked up either by parents or the school 
bus, or walked home. 
</P>
<P>
Anacapa principal McElroy said she hoped that Ventura's four middle schools 
could get together and formulate a "hard, fast rule" forbidding limousines and 
other high-profile expenses at future eighth-grade graduation events. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we do, we may have parents telling us we're violating their rights," 
McElroy said. "We're literally caught in the middle."

LAGUNA BEACH CITY WORKER ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT

A police sting operation led to the arrest Thursday of a city maintenance 
supervisor suspected of siphoning money from city parking meters and change 
machines that he emptied and repaired as part of his job, City Manager Kenneth 
C. Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Harris, 40, a Dana Point resident who has supervised the repair of parking 
meters and the collection of money from them for about 14 of the 19 years he 
has worked for Laguna Beach, was arrested on suspicion of embezzlement and then 
released, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest took place without incident in the city's motor-vehicle repair shop 
shortly after 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Frank would not comment on how much money Harris is suspected of taking. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we really don't know," he said. "It was a relatively small 
amount. There's only so many quarters you can take." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe Harris had been taking the money for about a year, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been investigating him for about a month," Frank said. "We do not 
believe that any other employees are involved. . . . (Harris) is cooperating 
with police." 
</P>
<P>
Frank said police conducted surveillance of Harris during working hours and 
used marked bills and coins "to determine if money was missing." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say what led authorities to suspect Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his home, Harris said, "I really don't want to talk to anybody right 
now." He said he does not yet have a date for a court appearance and is still 
in the process of getting an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is the supervisor in a three-employee maintenance division. One of the 
other two positions is currently unfilled.

ELECTION JEOPARDIZES JORDAN RANCH PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS: THE VICTORY OF SLOW-GROWTH CANDIDATE MARIA VANDERKOLK COULD TIP 
THE SCALES AGAINST THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County supervisors, reacting to the election of a new slow-growth 
member, cast new doubts this week that the board will approve the subdivision 
of Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch in the rolling hills of the southeast county. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' rejection would not only kill the 750-house project but would, 
in effect, veto a complex land swap between Hope and the National Park Service 
that would turn 5,700 acres of mountain property in Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties into parkland, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the five county supervisors who are scheduled to review the project in 
January have either pledged to vote against it or have voted against it in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances of it passing are slim. If I were the developer, I would feel very 
uncomfortable right now," Supervisor John K. Flynn said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's upset election of slow-growth advocate Maria VanderKolk to the 
Board of Supervisors may have provided the swing vote against the project, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that election and the fact that two supervisors voted against going ahead 
with the environmental impact report in the first place," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn and Supervisor Susan K. Lacey voted last July not to allow developers to 
study the environmental effects of the proposal and of an adjacent project at 
the Ahmanson Ranch. Denial would have killed the projects, but the study was 
approved 3 to 2 by the board. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who voted for the study, has been 
defeated by VanderKolk, whose opposition to development of Jordan Ranch was the 
centerpiece of her campaign. VanderKolk takes office in January, in time for 
hearings on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Maggie Erickson, a potential fourth vote against the project, has 
said that she has grave concerns about it. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson would have rejected the project last year, she said Wednesday, if 
representatives of the state-funded Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy had not 
supported it as a way to place thousands of acres owned by Hope into public 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I didn't turn it down had to do with land going into the 
conservancy," she said. "The information I had was that environmentalists were 
saying this is important enough to allow the development. Now, there is a great 
division of opinion by people involved with the parks about this project." 
</P>
<P>
Under the land-swap proposal, the National Park Service would exchange 59 acres 
needed for an access road to the Jordan subdivision for 1,100 acres of the 
2,308-acre ranch. In addition, Hope is donating and selling 4,600 acres in the 
Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains to park agencies for a below-market $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The land swap plan has split the environmental community. It is described by 
supporters, including the Sierra Club's Southern California Conservation 
Committee and the conservancy, as the best deal possible considering the 
shortage of public money to buy parklands. 
</P>
<P>
But it has been denounced by critics -- including the Wilderness Society -- who 
say that the Jordan Ranch should be preserved as open space because it is 
within the boundaries of a national recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Hope agreed Wednesday to cut his price for the lands in half -- to $10 million 
-- in a deal negotiated by Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), a leading 
proponent of preserving open space in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson's support significantly enhances the deal's prospects for funding by 
Congress and approval by the Park Service, backers and opponents said. 
</P>
<P>
It followed endorsements of the swap by Sen. Pete Wilson, the California 
Republican gubernatorial nominee, and Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). 
A spokesman for state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) confirmed Thursday that 
the lawmaker also supports the swap. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) opposes it. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson said he negotiated the reduced price with Peter Kyros, general 
partner of Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option on Jordan Ranch. 
Beilenson said he proposed the 50% reduction in price, which Kyros worked out 
with Hope. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman said, however, that the entire deal depends on the County Board 
of Supervisors approving development at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything depends on the developers being able to develop Jordan," Beilenson 
said. He cited VanderKolk's victory as a possible setback to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Park Service officials said Thursday that they are monitoring the supervisors' 
deliberations and do not intend to enter into a final agreement on the land 
swap until the county board votes on the Jordan project. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably will not make our final decision on whether the exchange is in the 
public's best interest until the county has had its Board of Supervisors 
hearings on it and has either denied or proceeded with its conceptual 
approval," said David E. Gackenbach, superintendent of the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Maas, vice president for Potomac Investment, refused to say that denial by 
the supervisors would kill the land swap. He did say that the deal would be 
"much less attractive if we don't have a development approved on Jordan Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
If the land swap falls through, Potomac's current access road is wide enough to 
allow construction of 28 luxury houses on 80-acre parcels and a golf course, he 
said. No county zoning change would be needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dividing the property into 80-acre parcels would mean that none of it would be 
preserved as parkland, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maas said he did not know if VanderKolk's stunning upset of Schaefer had 
prompted Hope to agree to a cut in price. But VanderKolk said Thursday that 
"the timing is too much of a coincidence" for her win not to have been a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
"They are realizing that they have a bigger problem than they thought," the 
supervisor-elect said. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said she would try not to let Hope's sweetened deal be a part of her 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried all along not to let that be part of my decision," she said. "My 
decision has to be based on its impact on Ventura County. If it harms the 
environment, then I won't support it." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said he voted against further study of the project last year because, "I 
was trying to be fair to the property owner. I said, 'There are some major 
problems here and that I don't think any mitigation measures can overcome 
them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Maas said as the heat of the VanderKolk campaign subsides he is hopeful that 
the board will see things Hope's way. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to take things one day, one week, one month at a time. We've got a 
long time yet before there's an ultimate vote by the Board of Supervisors."

LITTLE LEAGUE PAIR OUSTED FOR BURNING JERSEY; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS: 'MY COACH AND I MADE A WRONG CHOICE,' THE SUSPENDED MANAGER OF THE 
YANKEES OF ANAHEIM HILLS SAYS IN AN APOLOGY. SOME PARENTS SUPPORTED HIM.

<P>
A Little League manager, dismissed along with his coach for burning an 
opponent's jersey in an attempt to rally his team, apologized Thursday and 
called the incident a "gesture of fun" that was an unfortunate mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"My coach and I made a wrong choice," said Randy L. Pangborn, who has managed 
the Yankees of Anaheim Hills for six years. "It was done merely as a gesture of 
fun. People who know me know it was in fun. It was not malicious. For this, I 
am truly sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Hills Little League officials disciplined Pangborn and his coach, Mark 
Leuenburger, late Wednesday night after a lengthy meeting of the board of 
directors at which Pangborn admitted that he and Leuenburger set fire to a 
replica of an A's jersey. Several outraged parents who witnessed the incident 
had called league officials to complain. 
</P>
<P>
Board members not only stripped Pangborn of his team but also kicked him off 
the board for the remainder of the season, relieved him of his position as 
field director and removed him as manager of the league's all-star team, a job 
the players elected him to. 
</P>
<P>
"Little League is supposed to be safe, build character and sportsmanship, and 
show children how to get along," said Robert Jackson, district administrator 
for 18 Little Leagues in Orange County. "This is was not the right thing to do. 
I have not found anyone who thinks otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said board members reviewed the incident at the meeting and were 
concerned about safety as well as the image of Little League managers. Although 
Pangborn's record and his own presentation were considered, Jackson said, "the 
action taken was appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Pangborn and some parents, however, said they thought that the discipline was 
extreme considering the fact that Pangborn has managed the team for six years 
and has worked hard to improve the skills of his boys, as well as find adequate 
fields for league play. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked them to forgive me," said Pangborn, who teaches children with learning 
disabilities at South Junior High School. "I think the punishment was too 
harsh. People make mistakes, but I make one mistake on one day and those six 
years of work don't count anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the incident involving the jersey began about 5 p.m. Monday, 
half an hour before the Yankees and the A's -- teams made up of boys aged 10 to 
12 -- took the field at Crescent Intermediate School on Gerda Drive. 
</P>
<P>
During warm-ups, Pangborn and Leuenburger staked up a duplicate of a green and 
yellow A's jersey on the pitcher's mound. After being encouraged by Pangborn, 
Leuenburger set the jersey on fire with a lighter, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
As it burned, Pangborn conducted infield practice, occasionally pausing to yell 
at Todd Sterman, the A's star hurler, and to urge his own team on to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Parents said Pangborn's attempt to psyche out the A's apparently worked; the 
previously undefeated team lost, 3-1. The Yankees scored all their runs in the 
first inning, some on errors, including a wild throw by Sterman that sailed 
over the first baseman's head. 
</P>
<P>
Although witnesses said they thought they saw Sterman's number on the flaming 
jersey, Pangborn said it was the number 4, not Sterman's 17. He also denied 
that two players were used to block the wind so that the jersey could be set on 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Sterman and other A's players ate pizza with the Yankees after the 
game was over, Pangborn said. "Sterman was with all my kids. There were no hard 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Parents who supported Pangborn said he is an excellent and devoted manager who 
will be missed. Gone will be someone who gets involved with his players and 
gives out baseballs weekly to team members for achievements on the field, they 
said. He has handed them out for no-hitters, home runs, hustle and player of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
At a team meeting Thursday night at Canyon Presbyterian Church in Anaheim 
Hills, parents of Yankee players appointed Mike Hayes and Jim Frazier as 
replacements for Pangborn and Leuenburger. Both new leaders were recommended by 
Pangborn after he conferred with parents following the Little League's decision 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the kids to have the best coach," Pangborn said after Thursday's 
meeting. During that session, he said, "they asked the children if they wanted 
to go on, and they said yes." The team will play its next game Monday against 
the A's; the winner will be in first place. 
</P>
<P>
It had been his dream to lead the team to the Little League championships, 
Pangborn said, something he believes that the Yankees are capable of. "I feel 
very troubled. I feel bad for the kids. I feel we've let them down." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting was restricted to parents and team members, several of whom 
rallied behind Pangborn. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Randy. He's the best coach in the league," the team's catcher, 
11-year-old Craig Scott, said after the meeting. "I've been on his team for two 
years, and I have the highest respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
Added Kyle Rivera, 12, who plays second base and right field: "I'm kinda 
disappointed. All that practice we've gone through. . . . We've done very well. 
I don't see why he should be thrown out." 
</P>
<P>
"He is an intense coach but an excellent coach," Brent Jones, whose son plays 
for the Yankees, said in a telephone interview. "The board has made a mistake. 
I don't agree with what he did, but it has been blown all out of proportion. He 
is aggressive and outspoken, yet he is a big teddy bear. The kids are gonna 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
Parents said Pangborn has been concerned about safety on the field, purchasing 
batting helmets that fit each player and making sure team members are separated 
during outfield practice so that they don't collide while trying to catch fly 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents want their children on his team, that's the kind of manager he is," 
said Frank Pangborn, his brother. "He has a positive attitude and is a good 
motivator. The kids love him."

HOLSTIEN WITHDRAWS FROM MAYORAL RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Holstien, school board president of the Orange Unified School District, 
has withdrawn from the mayoral campaign one month after announcing his 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't take the time necessary to run for mayor and be the school board 
president," Holstien said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be other years to run for mayor." 
</P>
<P>
There are no other declared candidates for mayor, though Mayor Don E. Smith is 
expected to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Holstien, who is also director of facilities and construction for the Azusa 
Unified School District, said campaigning for office would take him away from 
his duties as board president during an important transition period 
</P>
<P>
Orange Unified has been seeking a new superintendent since John Ikerd resigned 
last November. Interviews began this week, and officials hope to fill the job 
by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The district has been mired in controversy for several years. In 1987, an 
Orange County grand jury indicted four school board members for fiscal 
mismanagement, and two recent studies show that the district is in danger of 
financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership of a new superintendent will be "the key" to the future of the 
district, Holstien said. "Then we'll get things humming from there." MARY HELEN

<P>
Two men were arrested in Simi Valley early Thursday for allegedly stealing 
$10,000 worth of belongings from a storage company. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Persing, 19, and Terry Wells, 22, both of Simi Valley, were being held 
Thursday at the East Valley sheriff's station on suspicion of commercial 
burglary, said Lt. Neal Rein of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:30 a.m., the Sheriff's Department received a call from a security guard 
who was suspicious of a van driving near the West Valley Storage and Van Lines 
at 440 Easy St., Rein said. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies arrived, however, the vehicle was not visible and deputies were 
unable to find any evidence of a crime at the company, Rein said. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, Sheriff's Deputy Bo Stephenson observed the same van, Rein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson stopped the van, which was driven by Persing and Wells, and found a 
pair of bolt cutters, Rein said. Stephenson arrested the men, and the Sheriff's 
Department later found $10,000 worth of stolen property taken from the company 
in the apartment that the men shared, Rein said. CAROL WATSON

STUDENTS DEDICATE TEACHER'S MEMORIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marine View School students began their last day of the school year Thursday by 
saying goodby to a favorite teacher. 
</P>
<P>
In memory of Rodney Collier, a Marine View teacher who died of skin cancer Jan. 
9, about 280 seventh- and eighth-grade students joined faculty, district 
officials and relatives in dedicating a plaque and a newly planted tree to him. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Collier's students, who raised the money to buy the sapling and the 
memorial plaque, eulogized their teacher as a dedicated, compassionate role 
model who cared as much about his students as he did the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The redbud tree is intended as a "living memorial" to the teacher, said Sue 
Hessel and Elethea Locke, who collected $250 from students to help pay for the 
memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"This was really pleasing to see," said Mary Collier, the teacher's widow and a 
Marine View instructor. "It's such an appropriate way to remember him. He was 
an avid gardener, environmentalist and outdoorsman, and this (tree) is symbolic 
of all the things he thought were important." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating with a bachelor's degree from UC Santa Barbara in 1969, 
Collier earned a master's degree in environmental education from San Francisco 
State University. 
</P>
<P>
Collier, who died at age 42 after 17 years as an Ocean View School District 
teacher, had taught social studies in the Gifted and Talented Education program 
during his five years at Marine View. Teachers and relatives said he took 
students each year on field trips to Yosemite National Park and Washington and 
helped found the district's Outdoor Education Program. 
</P>
<P>
After his cancer caused by long-term exposure to the sun was diagnosed in 
February, 1989, and as he went through medical treatment to fight the disease, 
Collier warned students about the dangers of not keeping skin protected while 
outdoors. A letter he wrote about guarding against the potential harm caused by 
ultraviolet rays was published in the school newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Hessel and Locke, who had been students of Collier during their last two years 
at Marine View, said they had hoped to dedicate the tree on Earth Day in April. 
But when those plans fell through, they agreed that the last day of the 1989-90 
school year would be the next best time. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought this was sort of like an ending to the grief," Locke said. "This is 
a closing of everything." 
</P>
<P>
She and Hessel said they raised the money by asking students, from 
kindergartners through eighth-graders, to each chip in a dollar for the 
tree-and-plaque fund. In addition to student donations, teachers and other 
staff members contributed another $100 for the memorial, Principal Bob Vouga 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plaque, which is set in the ground in front of the young tree, bears 
Collier's name, along with the words of American naturalist and writer John 
Muir: "Happy the man to whom every tree is a friend. . . . Great as they are . 
. . we may carry them about with us in our hearts." JOHN PENNER

ALCOHOL SUSPECTED IN TRANSIENT'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 36-year-old transient, who was known for his wit and penchant for working 
crossword puzzles, was found dead in Oxnard early Thursday beneath a bush where 
he sometimes spent the night. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Christian Montry, who was known as T.J., was discovered in the 640 block 
of Meta Street about 4:10 a.m. by a homeless friend who tried to wake him, said 
Craig Stevens of the Ventura County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The friend called for help and the Oxnard Police Department and paramedics 
responded. However, Stevens said, Montry probably had been dead about 24 hours 
when he was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that the cause of death was alcohol-related, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Montry, who had a history of alcohol abuse, was a regular visitor at the 
Ventura County Rescue Mission in Oxnard, which provides beds and meals to the 
homeless as well as running a drug and alcohol treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
Montry, who told friends at the mission that he had once been in the U.S. Navy, 
was "intelligent and witty but down on life," said Andy Anderson, assistant 
chaplain at the mission.

PENALTIES STUDIED FOR WASTING WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of an effort to identify water-saving measures, the city of Oxnard is 
studying whether to make wasting water illegal and punishable by jail time and 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released this week, Public Works Director James Frandsen said the 
water-wasting practices covered by the proposed law could include over-watering 
lawns and hosing off driveways and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and businesses also could be penalized under the proposed law for 
maintaining fountains and carwashes that do not recycle water. 
</P>
<P>
Similar laws have been passed in Ventura and Camarillo, while several other 
cities in Ventura County have adopted voluntary water-conservation guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would be part of a water-conservation plan that the City 
Council is expected to consider in September, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The city is now offering residents free water-saving kits that include two 
shower flow devices and two dye tablets that detect leaks in toilet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard is also offering partial or full rebates to residents who exchange 
older, conventional toilets for new, ultra-low-flush models. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard residents use an average of 160 gallons of water per person per day, one 
of the lowest per-capita rates in the county, according to the report. HUGO

TRIAL OPENS OVER FATAL '88 MOBIL REFINERY BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fatal explosion at Mobil Oil's Torrance refinery two years ago was a "tragic, 
unpredictable, unavoidable accident," not a crime, said an attorney for a 
contract company whose officials went on trial in Municipal Court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In opening arguments for a rare criminal trial on industrial safety violations, 
attorney Warren L. Ettinger argued that no one should be blamed for the July 
15, 1988, explosion of a tank at the refinery because no one knows exactly why 
the tank blew up. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, say they know exactly what caused the explosion: 
Supervisors and executives of Cal Cat Chemical Co., a Benecia-based contract 
company, did not tell their workers about the dangers of the chemicals they 
were using and allowed them to create an explosive mix inside the tank. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Cat employee Winston Jones, 30, was standing on top of the tank when the 
blast hit. He died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
One of his co-workers, David Moustafi, suffered burns over three-quarters of 
his body. Another co-worker, Jerry Lekberg, lost hearing completely in one ear 
and still experiences frequent flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
A year after the blast, the city of Torrance filed misdemeanor charges against 
Cal Cat Chemical; the company's president, Paul Taylor; its research director, 
Frank Straw, and on-site supervisor James Hernandez. A Municipal Court judge in 
October dismissed charges that also had been filed against Mobil and two of its 
executives. Prosecutors are appealing that decision. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, expected to take three to four weeks, will feature dozens of 
technical witnesses on the chemical aspects of what the workers were doing, 
their training, their injuries, as well as testimony from the two survivors. 
Mobil officials may also be called. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony G. Patchett told jurors that the explosion took 
place as Jones, Moustafi and Lekberg tried to treat sludge removed from the 
bottom of a sour water storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
Sour water, a waste product of refining gasoline, is contaminated with sulfur 
compounds, most typically toxic hydrogen sulfide. The rotten egg-smelling 
substance must be neutralized, and oily hydrocarbons, rust particles and other 
contaminants must be removed from the sludge before it can be taken to a 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Cat Chemical, which had been working under contract at Mobil for about two 
years, had been hired to conduct that process. 
</P>
<P>
An initial attempt, using chemicals called surfactants and a potassium 
permanganate solution, failed. The explosion took place, Patchett said, because 
defendants Taylor and Straw then decided to alter the process by using hydrogen 
peroxide. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, the workers were not told to dilute the new chemical 
before adding it to the process. The concentrated hydrogen peroxide, Patchett 
said, created an uncontrollable reaction with chemicals in the sludge, causing 
the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Cat officials, Patchett said, "failed to give any written safety 
instructions to their employees, failed to explain the dangers of hydrogen 
peroxide and failed to monitor temperatures in the tank which could have 
provided some warning of a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys, however, said Cal Cat officials hired Moustafi, who had been 
trained as a chemical engineer, to prevent just such a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Moustafi "had the responsibility of testing the (hydrogen peroxide) to see if 
it would indeed work. He did so, and it did work," Ettinger said. "Mr. Moustafi 
did what he believed was right." 
</P>
<P>
The company, Ettinger argued, should not be responsible for training the 
engineer it had hired as an expert. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Moustafi did not have enough training and experience to make 
that judgment and should not have been given that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is being held at the Best Western Sunrise Hotel in Redondo Beach 
because the cramped Torrance courthouse does not have enough courtrooms to 
handle lengthy trials, said South Bay Municipal Court Judge Josh M. Fredricks.

SHELTER FOR WOMEN FACES CLOSURE; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: PANEL RECOMMENDS ENDING COUNTY PAYMENTS FOR BATTERED WOMEN'S FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South Bay home for battered women is one of two shelters in the county that 
may be forced to close if the Board of Supervisors approves a budget cut 
recommended by a county advisory panel, shelter administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
The Domestic Violence Council recommended earlier this week that the county 
discontinue $60,000 yearly payments to shelters in Glendale and the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay shelter, operated by the 1736 Family Crisis Center, is located in 
one of the area's beach cities, but its address is kept confidential to protect 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although 16 other homes for battered women operate in the county, the South Bay 
and Glendale shelters provide unique services. Known as transitional shelters, 
they are the only two where women can stay for more than 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers and law enforcement officials who make up the Domestic Violence 
Council said the cuts are needed to assure that there is enough money to 
operate the county's 16 other domestic violence shelters. The council 
recommended that the other shelters continue to receive $80,000 apiece per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are expected to consider the proposed cuts Tuesday or the next 
week. The reductions would take effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the two shelters said they are lobbying the supervisors to 
prevent the cuts, which would leave them to survive on private donations and 
other government grants. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed cuts were triggered by a slowdown in the collection of marriage 
license fees -- which pay for the county's contribution to women's shelters -- 
and overly optimistic budgeting by the county Department of Community and 
Senior Citizen Services, department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale and South Bay shelters were singled out for reductions because of 
their designation as transitional shelters, whereas the 16 other county homes 
are emergency shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Women can stay in the emergency shelters for a maximum of 45 days after 
escaping an abusive mate, then must move out on their own or into one of the 
transitional shelters if they choose not to return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The county collects $35 for every marriage license it issues, with $19 going to 
domestic violence shelters. State law recommends that the marriage license 
money be used to pay for emergency shelters and not longer-term housing that 
the Glendale and South Bay shelters provide, said Larry Johnson, assistant 
director of the county Department of Community and Senior Citizen Services. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the transitional shelters said private donations and other 
government grants might not be enough to make up for the lost money. 
</P>
<P>
The $60,000 cut would reduce the budget of the South Bay shelter by one-fourth, 
the equivalent of salaries and benefits for two full-time employees, said Ron 
Troupe, president of the board of directors of the 1736 Family Crisis Center. 
The center also operates an emergency shelter for battered women, a shelter for 
runaways and a mental health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"We would try to make every effort not to close the transitional shelter," 
Troupe said, "but if we don't have the funding, that is definitely an option." 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale shelter would lose 40% of its $150,000 budget if the cut is 
approved, said Pax Adair, director of the Glendale YWCA, which operates the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"This was all sprung on us rather suddenly," Adair said. "If it is approved, 
there is a good possibility we will have to shut down." 
</P>
<P>
Adair, who came to the shelter eight years ago as a resident, said transitional 
facilities are just as important as the others. 
</P>
<P>
"We give women more time to build their resources and their skills," Adair 
said. Without such shelters, she said, "a high percentage of women go back on 
the street or go back to the batterer, because they are not ready emotionally, 
financially or in any other way." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Adelkoff, director of the South Bay shelter, said the loss of the homes 
would put women in danger. 
</P>
<P>
"We find that it is almost certain the abuse will continue when they go back 
home," she said, "and, often, it escalates. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay shelter has beds for 12 women and children, and the Glendale 
shelter houses 18 women and children. 
</P>
<P>
County officials called each of the 18 shelters last week to inform them that 
funding for the fiscal year beginning July 1 would drop from $1.4 million to $1 
million. The Domestic Violence Council recommended, however, that the 16 other 
shelters continue to receive the same funding, a rate that would come to $1.28 
million for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The county has allowed the marriage license fund to be overdrawn by $225,000 in 
the last two years, but reductions must be made to make up the deficit, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of marriage licenses issued by the county has decreased from 76,066 
in fiscal year 1986-'87 to 71,834 in 1988-'89, with an attendant decrease in 
money for women's shelters, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the county probably erred in not reducing funding for the shelters 
earlier, when the drop-off in marriages began. 
</P>
<P>
Adelkoff said she hopes the board will decide to spread the shortfall to all 18 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"That is one good option available to them," Adelkoff said. "Then everyone 
could try to make up the difference with private fund raising."

$50,000 DONATION TO HELP PAY FOR BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robbie Lee would seem an unlikely benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is 27, single, has no children, never attended a school in the Saddleback 
Valley and really, for the most part, would rather be surfing. 
</P>
<P>
So why is this man giving $50,000 for a school bus for the Saddleback Valley 
Unified School District? 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, this area has been very good to me and to my business," Lee 
said. "Secondly, I love kids. Lazy adults, stupid adults I have no patience 
with. But kids I'll do anything for, any time." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, the owner of the 13-store Video City chain, is donating all the receipts 
from his Mission Viejo store for the month of June to the Saddleback Valley 
Educational Foundation, a community support group for the school district. 
That's the gross receipts, everything that walks in the door. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be more than $50,000," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Valmere Kranek, foundation president, said the group has "been in existence 
since 1983 and gone through different growing pains and various levels of 
involvement. But Robbie has given us a rebirth." 
</P>
<P>
Lee's video career started three years ago in Upland when he put his savings, 
$40,000, into a friend's video store. The partner could not make the store go, 
so Lee repossessed it. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to; it was all the money I had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later he has a chain of stores stretching from Mission Viejo to 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
With Lee's money, the district hopes to pay for a large chunk of the $100,000 
needed for a new bus. It will be used principally for field trips.

"I was shocked to learn that a district in this affluent area was having 
trouble transporting kids on field trips," Lee said. "This is a beautiful area 
to grow up in, but it's insulated. I think kids need to be exposed to all the 
other things that are out there, and field trips can do that." LEN HALL

FIFTH-GRADERS SCORE WITH ANTI-DRUG FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 26-minute drug-fighting video written, produced and enacted by 10 
fifth-graders at Top of the World Elementary School has won second place in a 
statewide competition. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, the students dramatize, in skits, essays and song, the rewards of 
remaining drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
The Top of the World class competed in the largest category (75 entries from 
fourth- through sixth-grades) in the contest, sponsored by the California Media 
and Library Educators Assn. The association encourages student expression in 
media technology. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, now in its 24th year, focused on video, film, slides, animation, 
"claymation" and computer-generated production from elementary schools through 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the Kid Vid, as participants dubbed it, came principally from a PTA 
grant by First American Capital Bank of Laguna Beach and Corona del Mar. 
Production was an after-school activity by volunteers who learned about 
cameras, script writing and filming from Cathy Krinsky, a former owner of a 
video production firm and a PTA chairwoman, and Linda Jarhaus, PTA president 
and teacher.

<P>
Ventura police have arrested eight people this week in a narcotics sweep that 
netted small amounts of the stimulant methamphetamine and 23 firearms at 
several locations in Ventura and Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
George Curtis, 45, of Oak View was arrested on suspicion of possessing a 
sawed-off shotgun, said Ventura Police Sgt. Steve Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who was being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail, was a 
target of the investigation which led to a search Tuesday of his house at 100 
Watkins Way, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
During the search, police found firearms and a small amount of methamphetamine, 
Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
They also seized a bomb that Bowman described as similar to those used by the 
military in aerial target practice. The bomb squad of the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department dismantled the bomb and found that it was inert, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Delia Coonrod, 35, of Ventura was also arrested at the house for possession of 
methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Ronny Archer, 24, of Ventura and Robert Blymer, 44, of Ojai came to the house 
while the search was under way. Blymer was arrested on suspicion of being under 
the influence, possession of drug paraphernalia and driving without a license. 
Archer was arrested on a warrant for violating probation. 
</P>
<P>
The search of the house led police to three storage areas in the 5700 block of 
Ventura Avenue, where they found chemicals used in the manufacture of 
methamphetamines, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Walton Peacock, 40, and Rosalee Jones, 32, both of Ventura, were stopped by 
officers after they left the storage area. Police said Peacock had two loaded 
handguns concealed in his car and about a half-ounce of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on suspicion of possession of methamphetamine for sale, 
carrying a concealed weapon, having a loaded gun in public and possessing a 
controlled substance while armed, Bowman said. Peacock was out on bail from a 
1989 arrest by the Ventura Police Department for possession for sale of 
methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was arrested on an outstanding traffic warrant and on suspicion of being 
under the influence of a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Hope, 37, of Ventura was arrested at the storage area on an 
outstanding traffic warrant. She was being held in the Ventura County Jail in 
lieu of $5,000 bail. James Paul Urban, 24, of Ventura also was arrested at the 
storage area on warrants for grand theft, violation of probation and a traffic 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
He was being held in lieu of $6,819 bail in the County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Coonrod, Peacock, Jones, Blymer and Archer were booked into the County Jail and 
subsequently released, either on their own recognizance or after posting bail, 
a jail spokesman said. CAROL WATSON

<P>
The Ventura County Community Foundation announced that it will distribute 
$26,250 in grants to 16 local arts organizations this year, an increase of 
nearly $5,000 over last year's donations to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old foundation created the County Arts Alliance in 1988 as a 
cultural arm to distribute grants that previously had been doled out by the 
Ventura County Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
This year, $11,000 of the foundation's grants came from The James Irvine 
Foundation, a statewide charitable organization that earmarks its funds for 
rural arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
Community Foundation President Cathy Edge said most of the remaining $15,250 
came from the California Arts Council, with some additional funds generated by 
local fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
The grant recipients include: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula Theatre Center, $2,500; Ventura County Symphony Assn., $2,500; 
Conejo Valley Art Museum, $2,000; Buena Ventura Art Assn., $2,000; Plexus Dance 
Theatre, $1,500; Ventura Arts Council, $1,250; Conejo Symphony Orchestra, 
$1,250; Santa Susana Repertory Company, $1,250; Fine Arts for Youth, $500; and 
Xanadu Theatre, $500. 
</P>
<P>
The institutions that will share in the rural arts money include: 
</P>
<P>
Teatro Inlakech, $3,000; Illusions Theatre; $2,500; Ventura County 
Multi-Cultural Art Council, $2,500; Royal Shakespeare Revels, $2,000; Brass

WATER LAW GOES INTO EFFECT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does a drippy faucet keep you up at night? Does your broken sprinkler head 
create a front-yard geyser? 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to take care of those troublesome, water-wasting problems 
because the city's tough new water conservation ordinance goes into effect 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The water-rationing law, adopted after a severe water shortage caused 
near-panic in the community last summer, is considered the strictest in the 
county and contains fines and a provision to shut off water use to chronic 
wasters. 
</P>
<P>
But as the hot summer months proceed, city officials hope that residents and 
business owners will take the spirit of the law to heart, altering lifestyles 
to save millions of gallons of drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the changes simply involve leaky spigots, resetting automatic sprinkler 
systems or buying a $2 hose nozzle with a spring-loaded shut-off valve. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent of the ordinance is really to sensitize or help people be aware of 
the need to conserve water," utilities manager Greg Morehead said. "Our goal is 
to work in a partnership with people to promote conservation." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the city has hired Lois Curtis to spot the thousands of everyday 
problems that translate into water waste and to consult with residents who are 
interested in correcting them. 
</P>
<P>
Her job, as the city's "water cop," is also to cite water wasters who 
repeatedly defy the new law. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we don't have to give any (citations) out," Curtis said this week as 
she patrolled the city looking for telltale signs of wasted water. "That's not 
my purpose." 
</P>
<P>
But as the "Water Conservation Period" of the ordinance begins, residents and 
business owners will face a set of new restrictions, including when they can 
water their lawns. The water conservation period lasts from today to Sept. 15, 
when the weather is expected to cool again. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, the only mandatory one in the county, is designed to prevent a 
repeat of last summer's water shortage. At that time, the Palisades Reservoir 
dipped from 44 million gallons to half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike water conservation policies and laws in other Orange County cities, the 
San Clemente law includes fines for violations. 
</P>
<P>
During the water conservation period, households with even-numbered addresses 
will be allowed to water lawns only on even-numbered days, and households with 
odd-numbered addresses on odd-numbered days. Violators face fines of $100. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, 400 businesses, neighborhood associations and others hooked to a 
city-owned irrigation meter can be fined $500 for using more than 623 gallons 
of irrigation water per week if they fail to notify the city of the total 
square footage they are irrigating, according to the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
For a second offense, water service could be cut off after a city hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who use more than 650 gallons of water a day will face a surcharge on 
their bimonthly water bill. 
</P>
<P>
If the reservoir water level dips to 35 million gallons or below, another 
restriction will go into effect: Spraying sidewalks and exterior structures and 
washing cars, trucks and boats with hoses not equipped with an automatic 
shut-off nozzle will be prohibited. Commercial carwashes will be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, residents will be prohibited from filling or emptying swimming 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
If the reservoir dips below 30 million gallons, further restrictions will be 
considered, according to the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said she has received about 30 calls a day in the past week from 
residents alerting her to water waste and asking her questions about how to 
conserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are pretty good," Curtis said. "They really are interested in 
conserving water." 
</P>
<P>
The city also is giving away water conservation kits, which includes two 
displacement bags for conserving toilet water, four flow restricters for 
faucets or shower heads, dye tablets to detect any toilet leaks and a booklet 
of water-saving tips, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are really aware," she said. "They are ready to participate." JAMES M. 
GOMEZ

WEEKENDER: BRINGING BACK MEMORIES WITH POTTERY DISPLAY. 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Faris What: Manhattan Beach Historical Society Museum's "The Art of 
Metlox" Where: Polliwog Park, Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Redondo Avenue, 
Manhattan Beach. When: Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Sundays, 2 to 5 p.m. 
Admission: Free. I 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With its sand and surf, boutiques and view homes, Manhattan Beach is a far cry 
from an industrial town. 
</P>
<P>
But for decades, it was a four-acre factory in the middle of downtown that gave 
the city an international reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Metlox Potteries -- with its vividly colored dinnerware, rooster-shaped 
pitchers, curving avant-garde candy dishes, and delicate miniature sea horses 
and flamingos -- reigned as one of Southern California's big five pottery 
makers until it closed in bankruptcy last year. Its wares were sold worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first and only industry Manhattan Beach ever had," said Keith 
Robinson, president of the city's Historical Society, which is spotlighting the 
art of Metlox as the first rotating exhibit in the society's new museum at 
Polliwog Park. 
</P>
<P>
During its golden age in the 1950s, Metlox operated round the clock, with 500 
workers filling three shifts. These days, Metlox creations have joined the 
ranks of collectibles, with some pieces by Carl Romanelli -- who was the art 
ware designer between 1939 and 1943 -- selling for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said pottery buffs from outside Manhattan Beach have been visiting the 
exhibit. He added that he hopes the show will temper the city's more recent 
reputation as the home of the McMartin Pre-School child molestation case. "It's 
nice to have a positive aspect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, which opened a month ago, occupies a steep-roofed, maroon 1905 
beach cottage that was moved to the park and restored. The former living room 
contains an illustrated community time line dating from the city's birth as a 
resort, when a lot and cottage were priced at $700. Files of documents and 
photos kept in a small, one-time back bedroom are available to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
The Metlox show, which will be followed by an exhibit on the famed Red Car 
trolleys that once linked Southland communities, is in what used to be the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
With its shelves and tables of ceramics and detailed written narrative, the 
show tells the story of a company that kepts its eye on changes in the economy 
and popular tastes, eventually succumbing to less-expensive imports. 
</P>
<P>
Metlox began in 1927 as a manufacturer of neon-lighted ceramic signs, including 
the first marquee of the Pantages Theater in Hollywood. The Depression put a 
dent in the sign business, so Metlox turned to dinnerware in vivid and 
glistening yellows, oranges and greens. 
</P>
<P>
According to artist and pottery expert Jack Chipman, who appears in a museum 
video about the exhibit, the dinnerware cheered people during those hard times 
and went perfectly with California patio living. "This was a big hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Birds, deer, frogs, penguins and other art miniatures came in with Romanelli, 
who Chipman said was a local sculptor happy to have the work. After World War 
II, Metlox boomed with production of Bambi and other Disney movie creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The 1950s saw the California Mobile style of tall, tapered pitchers and 
free-form bowls and dishes with designs resembling colorful mobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Metlox declined during the 1980s as cheaper, foreign-made pottery undercut its 
pricier items. The death knell came last year when the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency ordered Metlox to clean up a toxic pit that had been created 
by decades of runoff from glaze production at the factory. The company went 
bankrupt and closed, angering some officials who accused Metlox of bad faith in 
not dealing with the cleanup. Property owners are cleaning the site so it can 
be redeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Chipman said that of the major Southern California pottery 
works, Metlox had the best overall variety, mingling the futuristic California 
Mobile style with traditional lines depicting farmhouses and fields. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit of more than 100 pieces is replete with the '30s dinnerware, 
Romanelli miniatures, the California Mobile pieces, and creations as diverse as 
dinosaur- and pineapple-shaped cookie jars. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Dennis, author of a Manhattan Beach history, says the exhibit is a 
memory-jogger for people who worked at Metlox or bought its wares. "They say, 
'I remember that when I got married 40 years ago', or, 'I remember when my 
mother bought that,' " said Dennis. "The Historical Society is bringing back a 
lot of memories with this pottery." Gerald Faris What: Manhattan Beach

INJURED EMPLOYEE OUT OF HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last of three men injured by a recent release of toxic gas at the Mobil 
refinery was released Thursday from Torrance Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokesman said Herbert Delome, a contract employee who had been 
hospitalized since Monday, had recovered from symptoms of nausea, respiratory 
distress and eye irritation. 
</P>
<P>
Delome and two other employees of Serv-Tech Inc. were caught in a cloud of 
vapors after an accidental release at the refinery's alkylation unit Monday 
night. The other two men were released from the hospital Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti said the release was a mixture of ammonia fumes, 
which are toxic, and a nontoxic chemical compound commonly called ammonium 
fluoride, which is formed by hydrofluoric acid and ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
Carbonetti said refinery employees did not obtain samples of the cloud, which 
workers described as dense, white, ground-hugging vapors. 
</P>
<P>
The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Torrance 
Fire Department are investigating the accident as a release of hydrofluoric 
acid. Hydrofluoric acid is more than 15 times as incapacitating as ammonia, 
according to federal safety standards. George Stein

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRACE OF ASBESTOS FOUND IN WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study of El Segundo's drinking water has turned up evidence of asbestos, but 
the cancer-causing substance was found in concentrations well within federal 
health guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The highest asbestos concentration in the 18 tap water samples collected in the 
citywide study was 1/20 of the maximum level considered safe by the federal 
government, said Robert Gils, the study's author. 
</P>
<P>
The concentrations were also well below the average levels found in a 1980 
federal survey of water-borne asbestos in 406 cities, said Gils, an 
Oakland-area consultant. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Ron Cano said the asbestos in El Segundo's water comes from water 
pipes made with a type of concrete containing the material. He said the 
relatively low levels of asbestos in city water supplies do not warrant 
launching a special program to replace the pipes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't recommend that," Cano said. "I think it would be an overreaction."

$2.5-MILLION WATER TREATMENT PLANT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles water officials approved a construction contract Thursday for a 
$2.5-million treatment plant in North Hollywood that will purge ground water of 
toxic solvents. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Water and Power Commissioners, which oversees the Department of 
Water and Power, chose R.L. Hartley of Burbank to install the experimental 
system, which will extract and treat about 2,000 gallons per minute of ground 
water tainted by trichloroethylene, or TCE, a solvent linked to cancer in 
animal studies. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which will be installed adjacent to existing city water supply 
wells under electrical transmission lines near Vanowen and Camelia streets, 
will use a combination of hydrogen peroxide and ozone to break down 
contaminants into harmless byproducts -- carbon dioxide, water and chloride 
ions. 
</P>
<P>
The system, scheduled to begin operating in January, will be the second pilot 
treatment system built by the DWP. The other is an aeration treatment plant on 
Vose Street in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Well fields in North Hollywood, Burbank and Glendale have been designated 
federal Superfund sites because of chemical pollution of ground water. 
Eventually, big cleanup systems will be installed. In the meantime, utilities 
have kept water supplies within health standards by shutting down the most 
tainted wells and blending water from less tainted wells with fresh supplies.

COUNTY IN BRIEF: BURBANK; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL OKS PURCHASE OF TRAIN DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Transportation Commission committee on Thursday approved 
the city of Burbank's proposed purchase of the Burbank Train Depot for $3.5 
million to be used as a transit center and commuter rail station. The 
commission's Planning and Mobility Improvement Committee voted to recommend 
that the commission at its June 27 meeting release the funds to the city to buy 
the depot from the Southern Pacific railroad. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be taken from the city's share of the proceeds of the extra 
half-cent sales tax that county voters approved in 1980. The city hopes to 
connect the depot, located west of the Golden State Freeway, to its downtown 
shopping area by a pedestrian bridge over the railroad tracks and the freeway. 
In addition to serving passengers from commuter trains from downtown to the 
Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura, the depot would be a center for bus service 
in Burbank, commission staff members said.

POLE VAULTERS TRY TO HIT NEW HEIGHTS AT MANHATTAN BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Move over volleyball and make room for the newest sport on the beach -- pole 
vaulting. 
</P>
<P>
While the average beachcomber expects to see several volleyball games, joggers, 
cyclists and roller-skaters on the beaches of Southern California, bodies 
flying through the air on the end of long poles might prompt a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
Organizer Dave Johnston is optimistic that Sunday's CHAMPS Beach Pole Vault 
event at the Manhattan Beach Pier will provoke such a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically there are healthy, happy, energetic people at the beach, and those 
are the kind of people we want to attract to the sport," Johnston said. "The 
event is suffering, and we wanted to try something to get it back on track." 
</P>
<P>
Some of America's finest vaulters have joined Johnston's crusade to put pole 
vaulting into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Curran, the 1982 Pacific 10 Conference champion at UCLA and vaulting 
coach for the Bruins since 1984, has similar opinions about the treatment beach 
pole vaulting has received in past years. 
</P>
<P>
"This sport has taken a back seat to other sports for a long time," Curran 
said. "When you think track and field, you don't think pole vault. We don't get 
the television coverage that's due to us. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought that it would be great to put the event where it belongs -- 
where people can view the event up close and personal. It ties into the beach 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Spectators will get a chance to judge for themselves Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighteen feet above the sand looks very, very high," Curran said. "Especially 
to those who are standing on the pier and still have to look up to see the 
vaulter." 
</P>
<P>
College division competition starts at 11 a.m., high school competition is at 
12:15 p.m. and world-class competitors will take to the sand at 1:30 p.m. 
Spectators will also get the chance to try the vault. 
</P>
<P>
According to promoter Don Franken, there were about 1,000 spectators at a 
similar event in Manhattan Beach in October. Weather permitting, organizers are 
expecting 10,000 spectators Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions at the beach could make or break vaulters' attempts. The 
vaulters' 150-foot runway will travel west to east, parallel with the pier. 
</P>
<P>
"With the aiding wind at your back, it will generate more speed, which will 
enable you to jump higher," Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
Kory Tarpenning, 28, winner of the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials with a vault of 19 
feet, 3 3/4 inches, will headline the world-class competition. Tarpenning, 
whose mark is second on the U.S. all-time list behind Joe Dial's 19-6 1/2, is 
the only American to jump over 19 feet in each of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
The event is not sanctioned by The Athletic Congress (governing body for track 
and field in the United States), so if a vaulter were to have a record vault, 
the mark would be a world best and not a world record. However, all marks will 
be sanctioned by the newly formed Beach Pole Vault Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Bright, 29, the No. 2 American vaulter in 1989 and Olympic decathlete in 
1988, recorded a personal-best 19 3/4 last year. Bright was a runner-up to 
Tarpenning at the TAC national championship last year. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Huffman and Greg Duplantis should provide strong competition. Huffman's 
unorthodox vaulting style enables him to clear the crossbar sideways rather 
than the traditional feet-first method. Huffman improved his best mark of 18-8 
1/4 to 19 1/4 last month in Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
Duplantis, 28, who is 5-6 and 140 pounds, cleared 19 feet in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the field of world-class athletes invited to compete are Scott 
Shaefer, Dean Starkey, Dave Watson and Lane Lohr. 
</P>
<P>
In the college division, Pat Manson, Brandon Richards and Kelly Riley should 
finish high. Manson, of the University of Kansas, has a best of 18-8. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, 23, the son of Bob Richards, the only two-time Olympic gold medalist 
in the vault, hit a personal-best 18-4 1/2 last week at Baylor University's 
Jesse Owens Games. Richards, who competed for UCLA in 1986-87 before 
transferring to Baylor, is battling back from surgery for two stress fractures 
of vertebrae in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech's Brit Pursley, UCLA's Jay Borrick and Steve Slocum, and Tennessee's 
Tommy Parker are expected to compete in the college division. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham's Howie Schrier and Torrance's Aaron Morris will compete for top 
honors in the high school division. Schrier's best of 14 feet won the Van Nuys 
city championship this year. Morris, who has trained for only a year, cleared 
13-10 this year to place second in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Van Slythe and freshman Jonah Goldstein's have cleared 13 feet. 
Christopher Dow, son of actor Tony Dow -- who played Wally on "Leave It to 
Beaver" -- has a personal-best 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger High's Mark Townsend had to drop out of the competition after 
spraining his wrist at an exhibition Wednesday. Townsend, who was vaulting into 
the surf with other pole vaulters, injured his wrist when he landed on it in 2 
feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters and organizers are optimistic that the sport can attract nationwide 
attention, much as beach volleyball has in the last decade. No prize money is 
offered, but that would change if organizers can add sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel will telecast the event in July.

YANAI WORKS ON GOLF, WAITS FOR OLYMPIC FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Yanai has been busy lately. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball coach has been planning his annual 
youth basketball camp and practicing his golf swing in anticipation of a match 
against friends Pete Newell, the former basketball coach at California, and 
Bobby Knight, the coach at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai has not spent much time on his role as assistant coach of the West team 
for next month's Olympic Festival. All he knows is that he's been told to show 
up for practice July 2 in Minneapolis-St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a committee that sorts the players out," Yanai said. "They get 
evaluated and then we get them." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai spoke with West Coach Don Monson in April at the NCAA Final Four in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"We went over some guidelines as to what he wanted from me, what we would do," 
Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Monson, who is basketball coach at Oregon, and Yanai will put the team through 
two-a-day workouts for three days before round-robin play between teams from 
the North, South, East and West begins July 7. The finals are July 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to working with some of the best kids in the country, many 
of whom could be on the United States Olympic Team in 1992," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai said he and Monson have agreed to keep strategy simple. 
</P>
<P>
"You know I like to play man-to-man defenses anyway," he said, "So keeping the 
system simple doesn't bother me a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai realizes that he is an ambassador for several causes. He has coached for 
13 years at the Division II level, where few if any coaches get a chance to 
coach Olympic-class athletes. He detests the zone defense because he believes 
that it slows down the game. He is not a high-profile coach at a school with 
financial resources, as Knight is, but has a 196-155 record. In addition, he is 
the only collegiate basketball coach of Japanese ancestry in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Can he represent all those interests at the festival? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to go out there and hope I don't embarrass (anyone)," he said.

TRICKY SAUGUS OVAL POSES CHALLENGE FOR CHASE IN BID TO JOIN WINSTON CUP SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Lap 19 of his first Winston Cup Series race Sunday in Sonoma, Mike Chase 
found himself in a strange place: first. 
</P>
<P>
He could look in his rear-view mirror and see a grid of Winston Cup greats: 
eventual winner Rusty Wallace, Geoff Bodine, Darrell Waltrip and 1990 Daytona 
500 winner Derrike Cope. 
</P>
<P>
In front of him at Sears Point Raceway, site of the Banquet Frozen Foods 300, 
was nothing but beautiful pavement. 
</P>
<P>
A national television audience was left to admire Chase's Freymiller Trucking 
Inc. Buick for four laps. 
</P>
<P>
This was no ordinary feat: a Winston West driver had not led a Winston Cup 
Series event since Jim Brown paced the Budweiser 400 at Riverside International 
Raceway on June 3, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Chase's lead melted away; Chase soon was passed by Wallace and 
finished 25th after experiencing engine-belt trouble on Lap 54. 
</P>
<P>
But the point was clear: Bakersfield's Mike Chase, at 38 just a rookie on the 
Winston West tour, is out to burn some serious rubber this summer. 
</P>
<P>
His goal? To join the prestigious Winston Cup tour by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if he could just lick little old Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Chase and a bevy of other top Winston West drivers will take to Saugus' 
one-third-mile paved oval Saturday night for the NASCAR Winston West 200, a 
once-a-year stop for the West tour drivers at Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Chase will be Van Nuys' Bill Sedgwick, winner of the Winston West 200 
last year at Saugus and runner-up to Oregon's Terry Fisher in the points 
standings. Fisher; Hershel McGriff, who was second in last year's event; former 
Winston West champion Bill Schmitt; and current NASCAR Southwest tour points 
leader Ron Hornaday of Palmdale also will race. 
</P>
<P>
Chase, eighth in the points standings, leads all rookies on the West tour with 
268 points. Bakersfield rival Gary Collins is second with 175. 
</P>
<P>
The demanding Saugus oval will test these drivers' skills. Just ask Chase, who 
knows the devilish track well from his many years on the Southwest tour. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the old saying about Saugus," Chase said. "To get your car ready for 
it, go to the Safeway parking lot, test it -- and then you're ready." 
</P>
<P>
Chase, the 1987 Southwest tour champion, last won at Saugus in 1984. Since 
then, bad memories of the "Super Track" -- as locals call it -- haunt Chase 
from a Southwest tour race in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chase says that when racing on an oval track he uses one foot for the throttle 
and one for the brake. But in first place and heading into a turn at Saugus 
that night, Chase became confused because of the proximity of the pedals. When 
he thought he was hitting the brake, it turned out he was hitting the throttle. 
He spun out and went from the lead to the back of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a bummer," Chase remembered, allowing himself a small laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after a strong effort at Sears Point, he is hungry for a win. 
</P>
<P>
"We just bought a good short-track car (a 1990 Buick Regal)," Chase said. 
"We're installing a new engine right now. And with the experience we have there 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Chase's voice exudes confidence -- that most precious commodity heading into a 
tricky little thing like Saugus Speedway. Now, the only spinout he anticipates 
on Saturday is a spin of the points standings, as the rookie continues his 
climb. 
</P>
<P>
For Chase and his team, Saugus figures to be a steppingstone to the big time -- 
the Winston Cup Series tour. Like other West Coast drivers, he draws 
inspiration from Cope's win in the Daytona 500. Cope, after all, is a former 
Winston West driver. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing an awful great job for us West Coast guys," Chase said. "Now 
everyone can see that there are some good racers outside of the Southeast." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that a national television audience was able to see Chase lead some of 
those noted racers didn't hurt matters, either. In fact, Chase insists, if it 
wasn't for the engine trouble, he could have pulled off a top 10 finish. 
</P>
<P>
"(The television exposure) was great," Chase said. "Customers (of Freymiller 
Trucking) from all over the country were calling in. All my relatives saw it, 
too. Usually, you're not on TV unless you're in front or in an accident." 
</P>
<P>
Accomplishing the former in his first Winston Cup event merits attention. "It 
really was a thrill," Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
The thrill was made possible by some last-minute changes. Chase and his team 
changed the frames on the intermediate-track car they brought into Sears Point 
to make it into a road-race car. After experiencing trouble with oil blowing 
out of the engine in qualifying races, the team worked hard on adjustments to 
make the car ready for the big day. Considering the obstacles that had to be 
overcome, Chase says, it was quite a splashy debut. 
</P>
<P>
"Our total goal was to qualify and just finish, since it was our first Cup 
event," Chase said. "We were really pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night will bring no national television exposure. But if Chase turns 
in an effort similar to the one at Sears Point, such exposure -- in the form of 
the Winston Cup Series -- will be that much closer. 
</P>
<P>
"If things go proper, and with enough sponsorship and help, we're looking to 
move on," Chase said. "My ambition is the Winston Cup."

DIGEST: BERKELAND COMMITS TO CAL POLY SLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Distance runner Dan Berkeland of Canyon High has made an oral commitment to 
compete in cross-country and track at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeland said he chose the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. school because 
of its architecture program as well as its traditionally powerful cross-country 
and track teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang men's cross-country team has won the past two conference titles and 
has placed fourth or better in three of the past four NCAA Division II national 
meets. Cal Poly SLO also won this year's CCAA track and field title. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeland finished fifth in the state Division I cross-country championships 
last fall and timed 9 minutes 7.52 seconds for 3,200 meters in the Southern 
Section 4-A Division track meet in May. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover High's Creighton Harris and Gunnar Miller, major contributors to the 
Tornadoes' track and field team, have committed to attend Wisconsin and 
Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a Wisconsin native, qualified for the state meet in the 1,600 meters 
and has a personal-best 4:14.33 in the event. He also timed 1:58.60 for 800 and 
9:21.4 for 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 2 runner on Hoover's Pacific League championship cross-country team, 
Harris chose the Big Ten Conference school for its recent success in 
cross-country. The Badgers have won three NCAA Division I titles in the past 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Miller accepted a $12,000-a-year academic scholarship to Harvard, Hoover Coach 
Greg Switzer said, and will compete in the pole vault. Miller led regional 
vaulters with a 14-foot 6-inch mark. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Macias, the latest to pass through the revolving door of the Notre Dame 
High cross-country program, will coach the Knights this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Macias, who helped coach cross-country and track at Bell-Jeff the past two 
years, becomes Notre Dame's seventh cross-country coach in the past eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Reed, a high-scoring guard for Canoga Park High, will attend College of 
the Sequoias in Visalia, according to Canoga Park Coach Jeff Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Reed (5-foot-10, 155 pounds) averaged 20 points and 6.3 steals a game last 
season. Sequoias, coached by former Cal State Northridge assistant John 
Boragno, was ranked fourth in the final state junior college poll last season. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Veres, a volunteer coach at Cal Lutheran last season, has joined the staff 
of new Coach Joe Harper as the Kingsmen's offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Veres, a former head coach at Oak Park High, will coach part time at Cal 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Teich, a sophomore left-handed pitcher at College of the Canyons, has 
signed a letter of intent to play baseball for Sacramento State on a partial 
athletic scholarship, Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. 
</P>
<P>
Teich, an El Camino Real graduate, finished 6-3 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Lucious Harris from Cleveland High and Cal State Long Beach has been selected 
to play on the West squad in the Olympic Festival in Minneapolis. 
</P>

TANNER RELISHING ROLE AS HEAD PRO AT SHERWOOD COUNTRY CLUB 
</P>

In his salad days, Roscoe Tanner could wilt any green foe with his blistering 
serve. The string-scorching projectiles left the knees of opponents on the 
professional tennis tour knocking. One Roscoe rocket reportedly was clocked at 
164 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, Tanner still is recognized for his service ace. 
</P>
<P>
Make that ace service. 
</P>
<P>
A Westlake Village resident, Tanner is the head pro at the exclusive Sherwood 
Country Club in Lake Sherwood. The club, which is ringed by million-dollar 
homes, still is in its developmental stage. 
</P>
<P>
Five courts and a tennis stadium are scheduled to open by the end of June. 
Ultimately, the club will offer members clay and grass courts as well as hard 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
"The stadium is probably the prettiest I've ever seen," Tanner said. "I think 
it's the best facility for tennis members that's ever been designed. Tennis 
players are going to be treated like golfers." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, they are going to pay like sultans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are breaking ground that has never been broken for tennis," Tanner said, 
adding that the club is finalizing its rates. "As a result, we are charging a 
price that has never been charged for tennis." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the luxurious facilities, members will have access to tutorials 
on the finer points of the game and to the latest cross-training techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Roscoe might even snap a few strings. 
</P>
<P>
Friendlier folk: After Tanner accepted the position at Sherwood last August, he 
and his family moved from Santa Barbara. He found the neighborhoods of Westlake 
Village surprisingly friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"In Santa Barbara, I didn't know the neighbors that well," he said, "I just 
knew their guard dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Civil war: Natasha Pospich of Woodland Hills was one of five girls who competed 
for the Maze Cup last week at the Courtside Racquet Club in Los Gatos. A 
10-member team composed of boy and girl all-stars from Southern California 
played a similar team from Northern California. Players from the 16- and 
18-year-old age divisions competed. 
</P>
<P>
Pospich, 17, ranked No. 2 in the 18s in Southern California, won both of her 
sets and helped pace her team to a 14-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Sectional fever: Pospich has her sights set on the U.S Tennis Assn. national 
championships in August but first will play in the Southern California Junior 
sectional championships later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Along with 1,887 others. 
</P>
<P>
This year's sectional field easily is the largest in the tournament's 88-year 
history. Last year, 1,596 competed. The event, which includes players from San 
Luis Obispo to San Diego, will be played in the Orange County area. 
</P>
<P>
A newcomer to watch is Jessica Kessler of Studio City, ranked No. 1 in the 
girls' 12s. 
</P>
<P>
Add tournament: The Racquet Centre of Universal City will hold its annual 
spring junior singles tournament Saturday and Sunday and June 23-24. Boys and 
girls aged 10 to 18 will compete. 
</P>
<P>
Information: 818-760-2303. 
</P>
<P>
Be my guest: Jack Darrah, owner of the Westlake Tennis and Swim Club, is 
cordial but his hospitality has its limits. 
</P>
<P>
Darrah and partner Chuck Nelson of Santa Monica defeated Tom Springer of Canoga 
Park and Gary Russell of Rancho Palos Verdes, 3-6, 7-6 (7-0), 6-2, in the 
55-and-over division doubles finals of the Westlake Tennis and Swim Senior 
tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost in the singles, that was enough," Darrah quipped. "You've got to carry 
that graciousness only so far." 
</P>
<P>
Springer and Russell, the top-ranked 55s team in Southern California last year, 
won the first set and led, 5-4, in the second before collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners included: men's 35 -- Gabriel Harmat (Woodland Hills) d. Tom Wire 
(Encino), 6-2, 6-4; men's 35 doubles -- Andrew Stanley (Malibu Lake)-Jim Pardee 
(Camarillo) d. Fritz Sproul (Ventura)-Eric Mann (North Hollywood), 6-2, 7-6 
(7-3); men's 45 -- Tom Muench (Idyllwild) d. Andrew Watson (Calabasas), 6-3, 
6-3; men's 45 doubles -- Ed Rosa (Calabasas)-Allan Drazen (Woodland Hills) d. 
Muench and Whitney Reed (West L.A.), 6-1, ret.; men's 55 -- Reed d. Springer, 
7-6 (7-2), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Women's 30 -- Patricia Kreutz (Tehachapi) d. Nasrin Alizadeh, 6-2, 6-1; women's 
40 -- Alice Middleton (Santa Monica) d. Linda Stude (North Hollywood), 6-2, 
6-2; women's 40 doubles -- Stude and Susie Patterson (Rancho Santa Fe) d. 
Barbara Oldfield (Bakersfield)-Bonnie Oliver, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4; women's 50 -- 
Sinclair Wooten-Bill (Santa Barbara) d. Audrey Folden (Claremont), 6-3, 6-2; 
women's 50 doubles -- Barbara Dunn (Calabasas)-Barbara Cassebarth (Calabasas) 
d. Patricia Coles (Santa Barbara)-Gennelle Linuille (Santa Barbara) 3-6, 6-4,

MIDFIELDER SIGNS CONTRACT WITH HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Gabarra, who played for the champion San Diego Soccers of the Major Indoor 
Soccer League, has signed with the Los Angeles Heat of the American 
Professional Soccer League West. 
</P>
<P>
Gabarra is expected to start at midfield tonight when the Heat plays at the 
Seattle Storm. 
</P>
<P>
Gabarra, 30, replaces Steve Sharp, who asked for his release but instead was 
placed on the inactive reserve list. Sharp scored two goals and one assist in 
limited action. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Connecticut, Gabarra played for the Heat last season, scoring four 
goals and making three assists. Previously, he played for the United States 
National and Olympic teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to being back with my old teammates and I hope I can help 
the team," Gabarra said.

<P>
WATERFALL IN ANGELES FOREST GIVES INTREPID HIKERS WORTHWHILE DESTINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost any weekend, the Switzer Falls area of the Angeles National Forest is as 
crowded as a Southern California beach. Parking lots overflow. Large families 
picnic under oaks or push baby strollers through the wilderness. Young men 
exercise their inalienable right to party. And left behind is the usual 
assortment of litter, with discarded beer cans leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
All this is not a pretty sight, which is why ramblin' Chuck Shamblin of the 
U.S. Forest Service likes to visit the falls during the week. Shamblin is the 
ranger charged with enforcing the law in the vast 700,000-acre forest. It is 
sometimes such a perilous assignment that he wears a handgun and carries both a 
pump-action shotgun and an AR-15 assault rifle in the cab of his Forest Service 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
But during the week at Switzer -- which is only 10 minutes off the 210 Freeway 
in La Canada Flintridge -- man is not a problem for Shamblin. "Now is the time 
to be here," he says, pulling into the empty parking lot off Angeles Crest 
Highway. The place is virtually deserted, returned to its natural balance. Even 
the litter is gone, having been picked up earlier by a crew from a juvenile 
detention camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I've forgotten how beautiful this area can be," says Shamblin, who has been 
working in the Angeles forest for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
During his four-hour hike, Shamblin forgets about his job -- his only bust is a 
young couple who let their sleepy-eyed beagle roam unleashed -- and 
concentrates on hiking one of the Los Angeles area's most scenic trails. But as 
he starts into the forest, he knows he isn't out for a leisurely stroll. His 
destination, the bottom of the falls, is a tough two hours away. He will have 
to work hard. And he will have to pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer Falls, Shamblin points out, is known for punishing the careless and the 
ignorant. Numerous fatalities and dozens of serious injuries have occurred at 
the falls, says Shamblin, who puts most of the blame on drugs, alcohol and 
macho-driven stupidity. Getting lost is also easy, he says, because vandals 
have destroyed almost all of the trail signs. 
</P>
<P>
And the fact that the bottom of the falls is only two miles from the trail head 
creates the erroneous impression that anyone can do the hike. Actually, it 
involves a lot of boulder climbing as well as a strenuous trek up and over a 
steep mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Shamblin walks through a narrow tree-filled gorge, part of the Arroyo Seco 
Canyon, which begins near the north slope of Mt. Wilson. The boulder-strewn 
stream that flows down the arroyo drops over the falls, about a half-mile from 
where Shamblin is standing. "One morning a few years ago, I saw a bobcat over 
there," Shamblin says, motioning to an overgrown gully. 
</P>
<P>
Shamblin is on the Switzer section of the Gabrieleno National Trail. It splits 
at the site of what used to be Commodore Switzer's camp -- a wilderness resort 
built by Perry Switzer in the 1920s, now reduced to a few fire pits and 
broken-down stone walls. By taking the trail at the left, a hiker can reach the 
top of Switzer Falls in only a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Shamblin stays on the Gabrieleno, crossing the stream and following switchbacks 
up a mountain. He passes a dangerously sheer section shored up with small 
granite boulders -- placed there several years ago by a Shamblin-led work crew. 
About halfway over the mountain, the trail divides again. The Gabrieleno goes 
to the right and winds up in Pasadena some nine miles away. Shamblin takes the 
one on the left, which goes to Bear Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The trail hugs the side of the mountain and often narrows to an intimidating 
two or three feet. At high noon, Shamblin makes sure he walks in the shadows of 
the shrubs above him -- for shade and to shelter him from falling rock. 
Occasionally, he stops to admire the view across the pine-studded peaks. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he comes down into the arroyo again, Shamblin leaves the trail at a 
point where it passes a 5-foot-thick dead cedar. He heads upstream into a steep 
ravine, taking a sometimes-indistinguishable trail that crosses the stream at 
numerous points and forces Shamblin to climb on and over boulders of all sizes. 
He finally gets to a small 30-foot-high falls. A lot of hikers stop here, 
thinking that this is the bottom of Switzer Falls, and are disappointed by the 
lack of grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
The true falls lies another few hundred yards upstream. First, however, hikers 
must negotiate a potentially dangerous arched granite shelf about 25 feet above 
the ground. Shamblin, still athletic at 48 years of age, easily climbs across 
and hikes the rest of the way to the bottom of Switzer Falls, where the ravine 
suddenly dead-ends. 
</P>
<P>
The falls is actually multi-level, starting some 200 feet up the mountain and 
carving a diagonal route through the granite. It culminates with an 80-foot 
vertical drop into a small lagoon. When the stream swells with rainwater, water 
cascades over the falls in sheets 10- to 20-feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
But even today, in drought conditions, it's about two feet wide, well worth the 
difficult hike to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Shamblin watches the falls splash into the lagoon. He dips a finger into the 
water and estimates the temperature at 60 degrees. Then he picks up a discarded 
Styrofoam hamburger container and carries it out with him. On the way back, he 
runs into a couple of hikers returning from Bear Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
George and Betsy Keliher of Pacific Palisades are longtime hikers. George began 
hiking in the Angeles forest as a junior high student in the early 1930s, 
during what is called the "Great Hiking Era." But he had not hiked the falls 
area for 15 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't really changed," he says, looking out at the high-desert vistas. "I 
don't think there's any place in L.A. as accessible as this where you can see 
so much beauty."

CITY ALL-STARS FALTER EARLY IN 9-3 DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County all-stars scored five runs in the first inning against Danny 
Choi and the Los Angeles City all-stars en route to a 9-3 victory Thursday 
night in the second Los Angeles-Orange County All-Star Baseball Game at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sauritch, who was named the Orange County all-stars' most valuable 
player, started the rally leading off the bottom of the first inning with a 
home run to right-center field. 
</P>
<P>
Sauritch, from El Toro High, said that his home run might have shocked 
Fairfax's Choi, the starting pitcher for Los Angeles, into giving up the next 
four runs. "It affected him big-time," Sauritch said. 
</P>
<P>
"He started throwing a lot of junk after that. It seemed like his out pitch was 
a curveball, but he kept getting behind and having to throw fastballs." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Napolitano of Los Alamitos followed with a single to set up a two-run 
double by Scott Sebbo of El Toro.

SPORTS ET CETERA: WEBB PUNISHES PATRICK HENRY, MONTE VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Section Commissioner Kendall Webb placed the baseball teams of 
Patrick Henry and Monte Vista high schools on probation and banned Patrick 
Henry's Luke Lowrey from baseball for the 1991 season Thursday after 
investigating a fight following the teams' May 26 section semifinal playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, who determined that both teams violated the ethics code adopted by the 
section before the 1990 season, levied several sanctions against them. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said he determined that Lowrey, a junior first baseman, started a melee 
when he punched an opposing player while the teams shook hands after Monte 
Vista's 9-7 victory. Patrick Henry was declared ineligible for the 1991 section 
playoffs and will have to forgo three non-league games and all regular-season 
tournament play, Webb said. Lowrey's ban will not extend to other sports -- he 
is Patrick Henry's starting quarterback -- but he will be on probation in them, 
Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista will lose two non-league games and be allowed to play in two 
tournaments instead of the normal three. 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches said they were upset at Webb's decision and that they would 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Lowrey) was provoked," Patrick Henry Coach Bob Imlay said. "I'm being 
prosecuted unfairly. I'm going to fight back." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rob Phillips, who has since resigned as Monte Vista's coach in order to 
enter private business: "Patrick Henry should get 100% of the blame. We're 
getting penalized for defending ourselves." DANA HADDAD

COUNTY'S BUILDERS ARE BIG WINNERS AT AWARDS DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County may be home to some of the nation's priciest residences and 
office buildings, but it is also increasingly the place where developers from 
other areas look for new ideas for their homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
That was made abundantly clear Thursday at the annual awards dinner at the 
Pacific Coast Builders Conference in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County builders and architects dominated the event, capturing 16 of the 
41 grand awards and 39 of 154 merit awards. 
</P>
<P>
Entries for the PCBC's Gold Nugget awards came from projects in 14 Western 
states, making the large number of awards given to county-based firms a lot 
more impressive than if the competition was drawn only from California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the winners were J.M. Martin Development, which captured best-of-show 
honors for a single-family detached home of 2,500 to 3,000 square feet, and 
Newcomb Development's best-of-show for attached homes under 1,200 square feet. 
Both winning entries were built in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some of Orange County's big names captured awards -- the Irvine Co. 
and owner Donald Bren's own development firm, the Bren Co., as well as the 
Santa Margarita Co. But so did a host of smaller firms. 
</P>
<P>
The strong showing seems to lend credence to the local development industry's 
oft-heard boast that despite a landscape dominated by hulking, flesh-colored 
Mediterranean-style homes, there is cutting-edge work being done here.

Do Fence Me In: Ever feel that it's hard to meet new people in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A survey of new-home shoppers by Yorba Linda-based Great Western Real Estate 
might provide a clue or two as to why. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, Great Western's 14th annual California Consumer Preference Survey, 
found that Southern California home buyers tend to be much more security 
conscious than Northern Californians. Asked it they would prefer wide-open 
spaces or a walled community with guarded or electronically controlled gates, 
54% of Southern California shoppers opted for the walls and gates, compared to 
only 39% of the northerners. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder we see so many walled communities in Orange County.

however. 
</P>
<P>
No less an authority that Richard L. Hall, president of La Linda Homes of 
Orange and president of the California Building Industry Assn., was heard 
complaining about the lack of quality in some developments. 
</P>
<P>
Hall wouldn't name names, but he said during a session at the San Francisco 
conference that he is sometimes shocked by the work he sees at some of his 
competitors' projects. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, at the prices even "cheap" homes fetch in Orange County, 
developers are learning that customers will no longer put up with inferior 
workmanship.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / STAGE NANCY CHURNIN: OLD GLOBE ACTORS ADAPT TO 
SMALL-SCREEN AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you care to catch a glimpse of how actors from the Old Globe Theatre 
translate from the stage to the small screen, don't miss the riveting and 
lavishly reviewed American Playhouse production of "An Enemy of the People." 
</P>
<P>
The show airs from 9 to 11 p.m. Wednesday and 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. June 22 on 
KPBS-TV (Channel 15). 
</P>
<P>
Jack O'Brien, the Globe's artistic director, directed Arthur Miller's 
adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's "Enemy" in his fifth production for American 
Playhouse, and all but two of the actors in the show -- Nina Siemazko and 
Robert Symonds -- are Globe veterans. That also includes actors in the mob 
scene (Mike Genovese, Ellen Crawford, Jeff Chandler, Anne Gee Byrd, Mitchell 
Edmonds and Tom Oleniacz). 
</P>
<P>
John Glover, who dates back to the 1981 Globe season ("King Lear," "Much Ado 
About Nothing," "Measure for Measure") plays Dr. Stockman, who thinks he is 
going be hailed as a hero when he discovers pollutants in the spa waters of his 
small town and ends up being reviled as an enemy by the townspeople, who fear 
that the truth, if it comes out, is going to ruin the tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
George Grizzard ("Another Antigone") plays Stockman's brother, the mayor. Byron 
Jennings ("Coriolanus," "Uncle Vanya") plays the newspaper editor who lionizes, 
then turns on Stockman; Richard Easton ("Uncle Vanya" and upcoming roles in "As 
You Like It" and "Hamlet") plays the publisher who urges "moderation" in the 
interests of the small businessmen he represents, and William Anton ("Intimate 
Exchanges," "Driving Miss Daisy") plays the journalist with a weakness for 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
It all fits in with O'Brien's continuing desire to bring back a closer 
collaboration between stage and film artists. That's a goal shared by American 
Playhouse executive producer Lindsay Law, who said on the phone from Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., that he would like O'Brien to direct an American Playhouse 
feature film. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't found the right property for him yet," said Law, whose 
organization just backed the recently released "Longtime Companion." 
</P>
<P>
Law and O'Brien have come a long way since 1979 when both were unemployed and 
Law was staying in O'Brien's New York apartment for six months while trying to 
decide if he wanted to settle in Los Angeles or New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I was writing a play, Lindsay was writing a book," O'Brien recalled. "The 
Christmas we were the poorest, he decided to make some bread for gifts and I 
decided to make Christmas cookies. Thank God we had a sense of humor, because 
we didn't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
They finished neither play nor book, but in 1983, Law, then at American 
Playhouse, asked O'Brien, then in his current role at the Old Globe, to do a 
live broadcast of "The Skin of Our Teeth" from the Old Globe Theatre for 
American Playhouse. That proved a success, and Law asked O'Brien to direct 
"Painting Churches," "All My Sons" and "I Never Sang for my Father." 
</P>
<P>
But it hasn't been since "The Skin of Our Teeth" that O'Brien got the chance to 
direct television with an Old Globe cast. He said he relished the chance to 
work with this pool of actors again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that my hidden agenda is to perpetrate a version of the 
American BBC, in which actors can move from the stage to the camera," said 
O'Brien, who turns 51 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, talking by phone from his Old Globe office, acknowledged that he had 
felt obliged to try for stars at the outset, but that he had known all along he 
had the best actors for the job in his own company. 
</P>
<P>
"In the event we fail, don't worry. I'll just bring my kids with me," O'Brien 
said he told the playhouse producers about his initial star search. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien not only brought along the actors that he refers to as "the Old Globe 
stable," but he brought along Old Globe composer Bob James and costume designer 
Lewis Brown, both of whom he will work with again on the Old Globe's upcoming 
"Hamlet," which O'Brien will direct. 
</P>
<P>
The show is timely, not just because playwright Miller was encouraged by 
O'Brien to move the locale of the play from Norway to a Maine village in 1893. 
In a telling interview with O'Brien that airs after the play, Miller relates a 
recent incident in a Swiss town where residents kept mum about poisonous spa 
waters because they feared for their economy. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien also sees a connection with the imperiled National Endowment for the 
Arts funding, a subject he will address in a KPBS-TV telecast Sunday at 5:30 
p.m., when he replaces guest John Frohnmayer, chairman of the NEA, who dropped 
out of the interview Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The pollution here is taking away the NEA funding. Public funding for the arts 
is what makes this society a glorious place in which to live. To take it away 
is to damage the plant at its root," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Sushi Performance Gallery will conclude its 10th anniversary 
season with local performance artist and UC San Diego administrator and writing 
instructor David Keevil presenting his latest work, "Sherman Speaks, Herbert 
Dreams," at the gallery through Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Coming back in the 11th season will be performance artist Leonard Pitt and the 
recently departed Latino comedy troupe "Culture Clash." . . .

SILENCE SPEAKS ELOQUENTLY IN 'TO SLEEP SO AS TO DREAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaizo Hayashi's "To Sleep So As to Dream," which screens Sunday at 7 p.m. at 
LACMA as part of Japan Week L.A., is pure enchantment, a tribute to the beauty 
and power of the silent cinema that is as knowing as it is affectionate. Except 
for sound effects, snatches of music and some ominous tape-recorded messages it 
is silent itself. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly lady, Madame Cherry Blossom (Fujiko Fukamizu), whom we learn was a 
silent actress, is watching in her home a 50-year-old serial -- in which she 
was the heroine -- called Princess Bellflower. Just as the masked samurai hero 
is to reveal his identity the film breaks. Her butler (Yoshio Yoshida) -- and 
onetime director -- hires a pair of naive young detectives (Shiro Sano, Koji 
Otake), saying that Bellflower has been kidnaped by M. Pathe &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Their investigation takes them to such quaint locales as the General Jintan 
Tower, the Flower Star Wheel and eventually the Electric House, an Asakusa 
movie theater, where Pathe just happens to be presenting Madame Cherry 
Blossom's serial, "The Eternal Mystery." "To Sleep So As to Dream" is set in 
the late '50s -- when, incidentally, Hayashi, was born; how the Electric Dream 
happens to be still operating can be chalked up to the movie magic that blurs 
fantasy and reality and which its writer-director celebrates with such 
imagination and precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Madame Cherry Blossom proves to be a benign Norma Desmond whose own devoted 
Max Von Mayerling wants to help recapture her youth in the most innocent and 
loving way possible. "To Sleep" is at its most touching when expressing the 
silent cinema's unique potential for pathos. On another level, Hayashi is 
having some gentle fun with early detective serials of the kind pioneered and 
epitomized by Louis Feuillade's fantastic "Fantomas" and "Judex." 
</P>
<P>
As for why Hayashi, who will introduce "To Sleep So As to Dream" (Times-rated 
Family), chose to make his 1986 feature debut with such a film, he has said 
that "This is the origin of the motion picture; there is a sobriety (to 
black-and-white silent cinema) which refuses anything which is not enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
Also screening (at 7:30 p.m. at the Pacific Design Center Theater) as part of 
Japan Week L.A. are "The Discarnates" (Monday) and "Buddies" (Tuesday). 
Nobuhiko Obayashi's "The Discarnates" connects with our deepest longings in a 
remarkably potent fashion. Who, after all, has not yearned for reunion with 
long-gone loved ones? Not only does Obayashi and his writers make such an 
encounter convincing but also give it a larger purpose; the result is a 
graceful, heart-tugging fantasy of the supernatural. The film's hero (Morio 
Kazama) is a dapper, 40-year-old writer of TV soap operas; like the detectives 
in "To Sleep" he too encounters the past in an old Asakusa theater. 
</P>
<P>
Shown recently at the Little Tokyo Cinemas, Yasuo Furuhata's "Buddies" exudes 
such a warm, sentimental glow that it's easy to overlook its subtlety and 
complexity, both as a consideration of the sometimes thorny nature of 
friendship, and beyond this, the treacherousness of nostalgia. The time is the 
spring of 1937, just before the Rape of Nanking, a prelude to wartime madness. 
Ken Takakura is wonderful as an industrialist who has an unrequited love for 
the beautiful wife (Sumiko Fuji) of an oafish office worker, his army buddy. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is free but reservations are required: (213) 627-6217.

JAZZ NOTES: ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF CANTOR'S FILMIC LOVE AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jazz grabbed film archivist Mark Cantor's ear at an early age, and the images 
of jazz musicians on screen, which seemed to him a logical extension of his 
love for the music, soon became his passion. 
</P>
<P>
Cantor now owns approximately 2,000 jazz films and you'll be able to see a 
dandy selection from his vaults in a free screening tonight at 10 at the Monica 
4-Plex, 1332 2nd St., Santa Monica. The program culminates a monthlong series 
of free community events that have preceded the 11th annual Playboy Jazz 
Festival, being held Saturday and Sunday at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
On tap tonight are several recent additions to the Cantor collection. "I've got 
some new footage of Thelonious Monk doing 'Light Blue,' originally aired on 
French TV in the early '70s, and a piece by Chet Baker from Danish TV from 
sometime in the '60s," Cantor says. Other clips feature vibist Lionel Hampton, 
who is on this year's Playboy lineup, appearing in the late '30s with the Benny 
Goodman quartet, and sax legend Coleman Hawkins. Two 1958 shorts spotlight 
trumpeter/composer Shorty Rogers, one with the Lighthouse All-Stars, another 
with his big band. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Cantor, who has been a kindergarten teacher for 18 years, began 
his love affair with jazz films serendipitously. "About 20 years ago, I was in 
a junk shop on Western Avenue and found something labeled 'jazz film,' " he 
recalls. "I took it home and it sat on the shelf for two years. I finally saw 
it and it was a film with (sax great) Lester Young and that whetted my 
appetite." 
</P>
<P>
NEW JAZZ CLUB: San Pedro, the hometown of the late alto saxophonist Art Pepper 
and the current city of residence for flutist James Newton, hasn't exactly been 
known as a haven for jazz lovers. But Ozzie Cadena, the former record producer 
who is also in charge of entertainment at the Indigo Jazz Club in Compton, 
would like to change that. 
</P>
<P>
Cadena is doing the bookings for Stingaree Gulch, a new jazz room located in 
the just-opened Sheraton San Pedro (601 Palos Verdes St., San Pedro, (213) 
519-8200). The club debuted last week and, according to Cadena, people seem to 
like what they're hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with (Latin bandleader) Poncho Sanchez and had a nice crowd," 
Cadena said as saxman David Newman could be heard playing "Stella by Starlight" 
in the background. (Sanchez plays a free concert today at noon on the steps of 
Los Angeles City Hall.) 
</P>
<P>
Cadena admitted he's still feeling his audience out. "I'm trying to figure out 
what they want," he said. "Since it's a new area, I may not be able to do a 
hard-driving jazz thing every week. So I've tried having the featured vocalist 
as the emcee. Last week, it was Julie Kelly, this week it's DeeDee McNeil. This 
weekend she'll introduce the house trio, then after they play, she'll sing a 
couple of songs, then introduce (violinist) Papa John Creach, the featured 
artist." 
</P>
<P>
Cover charges will average about $6, Cadena said. A liquor license is pending. 
Music begins about 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Artists on tap include pianist Paul Smith, Tuesday; guitarist Laurindo Almeida 
plus pianist Gildo Mahones' trio and McNeil, Wednesday, and Creach again on 
Thursday. In July, New Yorkers Fred Hersch and Louis Hayes will arrive. 
</P>
<P>
BREAKFAST JAM: Marla's Memory Lane in Los Angeles is hosting a breakfast jam 
session Sunday from 1-4 a.m. Vibist Bobby Hutcherson, who is appearing at 
Marla's tonight and Saturday, and pianist Horace Tapscott will perform and 
numerous guest artists will be on tap. "We're hoping that some of the people 
from Playboy will drop by," said trombonist George Bohanon, who handles 
artists' bookings for the nightspot. Cover charge is $7. Information: (213) 
294-8430. 
</P>
<P>
SINGING THE BLUES?: If you've got the blues and feel like sharing that emotion, 
why not enter KLON-FM's Blues Talent Search, held in conjunction with the 
station's 11th annual Long Beach Blues Festival Sept. 15-16. For an entry 
blank, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to KLON-FM, 1288 N. Bellflower 
Blvd., Long Beach 90815-4198, attention Blues Talent Search. Deadline for 
entries is June 30.

ARTS NOTES: REMODELING COSTS FOR AUDITORIUM STILL UP IN AIR IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just over a year from the projected closing of Fullerton's Plummer Auditorium 
for renovation, officials say it will be October before they will know the 
final cost and scope of the remodeling. The 60-year-old building needs air 
conditioning, an orchestra pit, more bathrooms and other improvements, but an 
initial budget of $1.5 million, to be supplied by Fullerton's Redevelopment 
Agency, may not cover all the needs identified, said Bill Flory, maintenance 
and operations director for the Fullerton High School District. Meanwhile, some 
arts groups that will have to take their presentations elsewhere during the 
year-long renovation are still seeking alternative venues. 
</P>
<P>
A Performance Poetry Competition will publicly pit poets against their peers 
June 30 at the Fullerton Museum Center. Organizers expect dozens of Southern 
California scribes to compete for a first-place prize of $100 by reading their 
works to judges Antonia Smolen, Robert Peters and Susan Hecht, literary 
authorities who will evaluate content as well as delivery. Admission is $3 to 
the 7 p.m. competition, presented by the Poets Reading Inc. literary group, 
which hopes to make it an annual event. Contestants, charged $5 each, may still 
enter. Information: (714) 441-1820. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Paper Tiger Southwest, which produces half-hour cable TV 
programs on media issues, will come to the Fullerton Museum Center on June 23 
to tape a show entitled "Interferencia: the Media, Racism and the Border." The 
group will present theatrical performances that examine media portrayals of 
border and immigration issues. Admission for studio audience members is $4 to 
$5. Information: (714) 738-6545. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Joseph Ballet Company will hold auditions for boys and girls, 9 to 19, 
on July 14. No previous training is required. The Santa Ana-based company was 
created by Beth Burns in 1983 to give dance training to inner-city youngsters, 
and about 95% of its members receive full scholarships from the company. 
Information: (714) 541-8314. 
</P>
<P>
High school jazz musicians are invited to audition for the Jazz Combo at the 
Orange County High School of the Arts in Los Alamitos. Musicians should be 
prepared to play a jazz solo and to sight-read and improvise with a blues 
progression, according to the combo's director, Chuck Wackerman. The High 
School of the Arts is on the campus of Los Alamitos High School. To schedule an 
audition, call Wackerman at (213) 596-1435.

WELLS FARGO BANK GIVING AUTRY MUSEUM $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It didn't take a shotgun wedding to get Wells Fargo Bank and the Gene Autry 
Western Heritage Museum together. The bank with a stagecoach as its symbol and 
the museum that specializes in Old West memorabilia are a cultural matchmaker's 
dream couple. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Wells Fargo announced this week that it's giving the Autry a $1-million 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
"We had never before given a grant of that size," said Judy Biggs, Wells Fargo 
vice president for community relations. "But given our history, that museum 
seemed perfect for us." 
</P>
<P>
Contact between the two institutions was initiated in 1986 when the Autry, 
located in Griffith Park, was under construction. The museum's executive 
director, Joanne Hale, met Wells Fargo officials at an exhibit the bank was 
sponsoring at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board had decided not to seek grants until we opened," said Hale, whose 
museum opened in 1988. "But they were interested in us and we began talks." 
</P>
<P>
Those talks picked up speed last year after the bank held its annual cocktail 
party at the Autry for its board and prominent customers. "That really tipped 
the balance," Biggs said. "The directors absolutely loved the museum. We sat 
down and began to cut a deal." 
</P>
<P>
The deal calls for the museum to receive the money in payments over three 
years, with the largest portion, $650,000, earmarked for sponsorship of an 
already existing 223-seat theater in the building. Another $200,000 will 
support programs in that facility, which has been renamed the Wells Fargo 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $150,000 will be used to help sponsor touring and special 
exhibits at the museum. Appropriately, the first of those will be the 
"Stagecoach!" exhibition that opens on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is the second-largest to be given to the museum, but it's a distant 
second. The museum received $54 million from the Autry Trust for construction 
and acquisitions.

ANIMATION COMPANY RETURNS FOR A 2ND RUN;

<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: FILMATION IS BANKING ON MOVIES THAT ITS FOUNDER DESCRIBES AS THE 
FURTHER ADVENTURES OF CLASSIC LITERARY CHARACTERS.

The flashy ads announcing an animated movie opening next week have a 
bittersweet quality. "Filmation presents 'Happily Ever After,' " the copy 
trumpets, with an illustration that depicts Snow White surrounded by seven 
little "dwarfelles." Yet Filmation -- for years one of the entertainment 
industry's largest animation companies -- shut down its Woodland Hills 
production facility on Feb. 3, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Why has the Filmation name suddenly reappeared on the entertainment scene? 
Granted, the animation industry has had a startling turnaround in the past year 
or so with the enormous success of "Roger Rabbit" in theaters and "The 
Simpsons" on television. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1988, however, when the film was completed, the animation industry was 
close to moribund. Things looked even darker when the acquisition of Filmation 
by Paravision (a division of the French L'Oreal conglomerate) from Westinghouse 
in February of that year seemed to effectively end the company's 25-year 
production history. The fate of "Happily Ever After," which features the voices 
of Tracey Ullman, Dom DeLuise, Zsa Gabor, Ed Asner and Carol Channing, became 
tied to Filmation's then-uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Scheimer, Filmation's former president and one of the company's founders, 
watched in dismay as the film "seemed to slip through the cracks" during the 
complicated negotiations between Westinghouse, Filmation's majority owner, and 
Paravision. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier Filmation theatrical film based on a literary property -- "Pinocchio 
and the Emperor of the Night" -- had been, according to Scheimer, "considerably 
less than a shining financial success." Paravision, with no desire to repeat 
the problem, was primarily interested in Filmation's extensive, and largely 
unexploited, catalogue of 1,500 half-hour shows; Westinghouse simply wanted to 
get out of the animation business. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were in the final negotiations," the 61-year-old Scheimer said. "They 
looked at the numbers for 'Pinocchio' and decided 'Happily Ever After' wouldn't 
do any better. So they figured, 'Well, we'll give Lou this other turkey as part 
of his settlement.' 
</P>
<P>
"But the thing they didn't realize was that 'Happily Ever After' is a much 
better picture than 'Pinocchio' was. It's much less pretentious and much more 
entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
"We learned our lesson with the 'Pinocchio' experience," said Robby London, now 
a vice president at DIC Animation in Burbank and co-author of the script (with 
Martha Moran). "We decided to just have a good time with it, without the 
moralizing and the message, and I think that's exactly the way it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the film was good or bad, Scheimer found himself without a company or a 
distributor. The vast array of Filmation-produced TV shows -- including "Fat 
Albert and the Cosby Kids," "The Archies" and "He Man" -- had become part of 
the Paravision catalogue. The very name "Filmation" was only usable by Scheimer 
as an adjunct to the title of "Happily Ever After" (reportedly as the result of 
a threatened lawsuit that insisted the film be specifically disassociated from 
Disney's "Snow White"). 
</P>
<P>
"At first," Scheimer said, "I just wanted to get out of the business -- to 
retire. But I kept an office open, and I finally took the picture to the 
American Film Market where I met this guy from Texas -- Milton Verret. He just 
came out of the blue and said 'I want to buy that picture from you.' 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him if he'd ever done anything in the entertainment business before, 
and he said, 'no.' He was in the mail order business, estate liquidators -- 
something like that. I told him, 'You're crazy. This is no business for a 
novice.' But he was determined." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember," Scheimer said, "that this was just after Filmation had 
shut down, and animation was definitely not yet back in vogue. So I figured 
selling him the film might be an easy way for me to get out. 
</P>
<P>
"But then Verret started doing things. He made his payments on time. He put 
together an interesting campaign to release the film. And, as many problems as 
he ran into, he kept finding ways to resolve them." 
</P>
<P>
Scheimer's original game plan, during the halcyon years of the early '80s when 
the studio had created a market in syndication for first-run animation with the 
original "He Man" series, was to balance television production with a series of 
theatrical films. 
</P>
<P>
"Secret of the Sword" and "Brave Starr" -- the first releases -- were both 
associated with Filmation television series. "Pinocchio and the Emperor of the 
Night" and "Happily Ever After" were the first installments that Scheimer 
viewed as a continuing parade of films describing the further adventures of 
classic literary characters. Most of those plans were dashed with the sale of 
Filmation. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I saw how well Verret was handling 'Happily Ever After,' " Scheimer 
said, "I began to think, 'Jeez, if this thing works -- if it finds an audience 
-- maybe we can get back to doing more theatricals.' Which is what I wanted to 
do all along." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Scheimer gets his opportunity to check on Huck after he gets off the 
raft or perhaps experience another undersea adventure with Captain Nemo will 
depend on the videocassette and box office response to Snow White's new 
escapades with her seven little Dwarfelles. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about the current expansion in animation activities," Scheimer 
said, "is that it proves there's plenty of room in the business for a number of 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's been frightened by the fact that Disney's out there, and Fox is 
out there. But the audience doesn't care about the company name. They just care 
about the property. Is it entertaining or isn't it? That's all. We may be 
called Lou Scheimer Productions now instead of Filmation, but if "Happily Ever 
After" is as entertaining as I think it is, we'll definitely be back with 
more."

<P>
SHAHRZAD IS MORE THAN JUST KEBABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ihave a sneaking suspicion that the rise of Persian restaurants around here has 
something to do with the rise of yogurt in our diet, but I can't prove it. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that Ventura Boulevard is lined with frozen yogurt shops the way the 
Champs Elysees is lined with trees. I also know there has been a tremendous 
influx of Iranians to Los Angeles since the fall of the shah. Let's hedge our 
bets and say the Persian restaurant boom is tied in with both these facts 
somehow. 
</P>
<P>
Shahrzad started as a humble kebab restaurant in Westwood and today is a 
near-conglomerate with four branches. The Encino Shahrzad, nicknamed Bahar 
(spring), shows how far Iranian restaurants have come since the '80s. The 
dining room is stark and shapely, with modish, quasi-Scandinavian chairs and 
tables. The white postmodern ceiling is a jumble of sharp edges and mysterious 
corners that looks as if it had been designed for a disco. 
</P>
<P>
What better dish to start a Persian dinner with than yogurt? Mast o mosir, an 
enormous bowl of plain yogurt and finely minced shallots, makes a pungent, 
highly digestible accompaniment for sheets of parchment-like Iranian bread 
rolled up with butter and/or various torshi, the Iranian pickles that the 
restaurant prepares. 
</P>
<P>
Torshi are made from onion, garlic or chili peppers; Iranians happily eat them 
straight. They have a very sharp, vinegary quality, and I find them to be an 
acquired taste -- or to be exact, a taste I haven't acquired. 
</P>
<P>
Hot appetizers in Persian restaurants are basically the Turkish appetizers 
familiar to most of us through Greek, Armenian and Arab restaurants. I found 
the hot appetizers here oily and painfully overcooked. Dolmeh are grape leaves 
with a delicious rice and meat filling, but they're unattractively soggy. 
</P>
<P>
"Eggplant delight" is a hot appetizer that actually is Iranian in origin, but 
Shahrzad's is one of the few unappealing renditions of this dish -- usually 
known as kashk o bademjan -- I have ever run into. The puree of eggplant and 
garlic topped with thickened yogurt has a vaguely sour, tired taste instead of 
the sweetness and freshness that should make it a perfect snack or dip. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entrees, there is a wide variety of Persian stews and house 
specialties, but as a Persian family at the next table informed me, most of the 
customers come for the kebabs. Apparently the grilled dishes are harder to make 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the kebabs here are mostly quite good, marinated in coriander, 
garlic and other fragrant things, then flame broiled and served on an 
outrageously large pile of rice. The best I tasted was the lamb kebab, weighing 
nearly a pound and tender as a baby's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Soltani, the largest dish served, is a combination of kubideh (ground beef and 
chopped onion molded onto a skewer and served in one long piece) and barg 
(steak kebab that tastes heavily tenderized). Both meats are extremely well 
seasoned with garlic and coriander. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't get to the chicken kebab, but that was by design. The one at the next 
table came charred black. 
</P>
<P>
The more curious diner may wish to sample some of the house specials. Proceed 
at your own risk in this restaurant. Their fesenjan, or pomegranate walnut 
chicken stew, was just awful, oily to the point of rancidity. That is a shame; 
the dish can be one of the true showpieces of a good Persian kitchen. Ghaimeh, 
yellow split peas cooked in a tomato saffron sauce, didn't please me either. 
Like many dishes here, it was more sour than anything else, with little 
subtlety or dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Only the albaloo polo, rice cooked with sour cherries, was as pleasing as I'd 
hoped. Oddly enough, the cherries weren't as sour as they might have been. 
</P>
<P>
You'd better like rose water if you plan on having dessert here; they have 
rather a heavy hand with it. Persian ice cream, for example, seems to be 
vanilla ice cream with a healthy snootful of it. There's plenty more in the 
zolbia, a lattice-shaped fritter soaked with honey that resembles the Indian 
jilebi. The baklava, made with a mixture of walnut and pistachio, is truly 
overloaded with the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Finish up with Turkish coffee or dough (pronounced "doog"), which is a sort of 
yogurt-soda. It tastes like mineral water and plain yogurt shaken together, and 
no, I didn't try it this time. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because I'm waiting until they serve it frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: mast o mosir, $2.50, lamb shish kebab, $10.95, barg 
sandwich, $9.95, baklava, $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Shahrzad, 17547 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 906-1616. Lunch and dinner, 11:30 
a.m. to 10:30 p.m. daily. MasterCard, Visa and Diners Club. Beer and wine. 
Parking in lower lot. Dinner for two, food only, $25 to $40.

<P>
FROM GERMANY, WITH LOVE TO BALBOA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California is one of the greatest places to live. I'm making this 
observation as an exchange student from Essen, West Germany, participating in 
the AFS International program. 
</P>
<P>
The Ralph Rodheim family have been my hosts since August in their home on 
Balboa Island. I remember very well how excited I got when their address 
arrived at my home in Essen. I tried very hard to locate Balboa Island on a 
map. After a while, I was able to pinpoint it on a special road map. 
</P>
<P>
I feel very lucky not just to be in California, but on the island of Balboa, 
surrounded by beaches and beautiful living areas. 
</P>
<P>
I am a senior at Corona del Mar High School, together with three other AFS 
foreign exchange students. This school's outstanding AFS chapter, supported by 
many students and their parents, has been able to host a great number of 
exchange students annually. Because of this program, my integration into the 
American lifestyle was made so much easier. 
</P>
<P>
I became interested in an exchange year when I was 13. My older brother in 
Germany was considering such a program, and although he ended up not going, I 
had already made my decision to go when I was old enough. 
</P>
<P>
I chose the United States as my host country because of the language and my 
curiosity about what America really looks like . . . fast food all the time, 
the TV continually running and kind of a Disneyland-like style all over the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, those expectations didn't come true. 
</P>
<P>
On the way from Germany to the United States, I talked to a Californian at an 
airport in New York, and he told me, "If you like surfing, the beach and nice 
people, you will love Newport Beach." 
</P>
<P>
That sounded good to me, and I found out he was right. 
</P>
<P>
I have found that high school here is not just a place to study, but also a 
very social place with lots of activities. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to America, I had never worn a tuxedo. But during this year, I 
have worn a tux four times and have also been chauffeured around in sunroofed 
limos twice. Although it was not the cheapest experience to attend a prom, it 
was a fun time. Dances like that were a totally new experience for me. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest difference in the academics of school, is the switch from "Queen's 
English," which is generally taught throughout Europe, to "American English," 
with all its slang . . . "dude." 
</P>
<P>
Another difference between school in Corona del Mar and Essen are the hallways 
-- they don't exist here. I enjoy that very much -- to be outside all the time, 
in between classes and on breaks. 
</P>
<P>
I also experienced the "big deal" of high school athletics as a member of the 
school's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
Long workouts every day took up most of my time during those three months. I 
was used to playing volleyball in Germany, but only two times per week in a 
club. Generally, most of the athletic achievements take place as club sports in 
Germany, not at school. But even then it is not carried out like here. A few 
evenings or afternoons during the week, and that's it. 
</P>
<P>
Although I did not reach the varsity level, I still profited a lot from this 
experience, seeing athletics from a totally new viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
During this year I also experienced my first Halloween, complete with shaving 
cream fights, and Thanksgiving, with lots of turkey. Now I am looking forward 
to the experience of Fourth of July before heading back to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling throughout the United States, I have found how special California is 
and especially Newport Beach, with its close access to the snowy mountains, 
great ski areas like Mammoth, as well as desert resorts and beautiful national 
parks like Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not forget the warm and sunny beaches, where I enjoyed spending most of 
my spare time playing volleyball, trying to surf or just laying back in the 
sun. Weather is never a problem! 
</P>
<P>
In my city of Essen, I have the forest with a big lake close to my house and 
downtown not far, either. The coast atmosphere is the biggest difference 
between the green of Essen and the sandy environment of here. I like both very 
much, and I hope to come back to Newport Beach frequently on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
On a trip to Denver, I realized the size of the United States. While driving 
from Los Angeles to Colorado, you could have passed through all of Germany, and 
almost all of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of drives, one of the main differences between our countries is the 
importance of the car as a means of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
I remember very well when I went shopping with my friend from Sweden, who is 
also an AFS exchange student. Since we are not allowed to drive in our host 
countries, we walked 10 minutes to the store. On the way back it was remarkable 
that people driving by looked at us astonishingly as we carried shopping bags. 
The sidewalks seem to have the wrong name in this country. On the other hand, I 
enjoyed asking nice girls to give me rides home after school. 
</P>
<P>
Going back to Germany in the middle of July, I will have to readjust to 
different habits. 
</P>
<P>
I will live as an only child, because my older brother is going off to college 
after I return. Here, I had the experience of having a sister who became one of 
my closest friends. Megan helped me adapt to my host community. On the first 
day of school, she showed me around and introduced me to her friends. 
</P>
<P>
It has also been exciting to see with what interest the Americans are following 
the changes in all of Europe, especially Germany. I have found that, generally, 
a reunified Germany is favored here. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the inner German border in November is considered a historical 
moment, and I am personally delighted about that development. It is a strange 
feeling to leave Germany and observe one of the most dramatic times in its 
history from another country, and then, after 11 months, return to a changed 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
I will be able to share a great time spent in the United States with my family 
and friends. It is interesting to meet people from different countries, and it 
is also very important to establish international friendships.

SURF CITY TO MEMORIALIZE ITS OWN IN MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surf City is soon to have a surfing museum. 
</P>
<P>
The grand opening celebration of the new International Surfing Museum in 
downtown Huntington Beach will be Saturday beginning at 4:45 p.m. The museum is 
housed in a renovated, 1930s-era former doctors' office at 411 Olive St. 
</P>
<P>
"Surfing is very important to Huntington Beach, and so it's a very appropriate 
place for a museum like this," said Julie Christine, assistant curator. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibits in the museum include historic surfboards, collectors' records of 
surfing music and a shrine to the late Duke Kahanomoku, the Hawaiian credited 
as being "the father of modern surfing." 
</P>
<P>
In connection with the museum's grand opening, the second annual Huntington 
Beach Long Board Pro-Amateur competition will be held Saturday and Sunday at 
the pier, as will the Huntington Beach Open women's professional volleyball 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Sunday, the museum will be open daily, from noon to 6 p.m., with a $1 
admission charge. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the opening ceremony at the museum Saturday cost $35, which 
includes a luau and street dance with music by Dick Dale and the Deltones. 
Tickets for the dance only, which begins at 8:30 p.m., cost $10. Tickets may be 
purchased by calling (714) 960-3483. BILL BILLITER

A FATHER WHO ALWAYS KNEW, SOMEHOW, JUST WHAT TO SAY AND DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET M. KINOSIAN, Janet M. Kinosian is a free-lance writer who works in 
Newport Beach.

<TEXT>
<P>
So there it is: the childhood photograph that recorded the memory I've been 
carrying around in my head all these years. 
</P>
<P>
It is my third birthday, and I'm all gussied up in a bright yellow swirly dress 
with black patent leather shoes and a huge white hair ribbon. I'm struggling to 
hold a box with a dozen red roses -- it's almost as big as I am. 
</P>
<P>
There's my smiling face brimming over the large golden box. My mother is 
leaning over me and gently whispering, "such a lucky girl to have such a 
wonderful daddy." The flowers were from my "sugariest daddy," as I named him. 
</P>
<P>
I knew what she was saying was true. I was -- and am -- lucky in this respect. 
</P>
<P>
Writing about a parent is never easy. Our parents lie at the heart of our 
innermost feelings and are part of our most important inner debates. For 
daughters, writing about fathers, this difficulty seems to be acute. 
</P>
<P>
This is risk. 
</P>
<P>
There are memories shared among women -- and many kinds of fathers appear: 
attentive, charming, loyal, gentle, shadowy, absent, tough, violent, or a 
quixotic mixture. Though mine is a close relationship, other women hold 
bittersweet or unresolved ties; others angry, painful encounters. Hatred exists 
as often as does love. We long to understand our fathers as much as we long to 
be understood. 
</P>
<P>
Women have a complex desire to be free and to be loved, protected, safe. In 
myself, I have long been aware of a conflict between my hunger for independence 
and for male approval and protection. 
</P>
<P>
It has been my experience that daughters who felt less love for their fathers 
-- and some who particularly disliked them -- are more independent of men than 
I am. They can detach themselves more easily from damaging relationships and 
have less need to see men as protectors. 
</P>
<P>
Love, warmth, cuddles, kisses, guidance -- my dad knew the sort of things a 
father is meant to do, but how? He had no father, nor any real role models, 
just a soft Mediterranean gentleness with children. And lots of love. 
</P>
<P>
He was not a distant father. He cared. His attention came to us in flood waves. 
He owned his own business -- a demanding job. But we came first. He returned 
home from the office each night with candies in his pockets. He bathed his 
babies, kicked footballs, skipped hopscotch. Above all he taught us kindness as 
we bolted toward him from nightmares, when we skinned our knees and made messes 
of our lives. He was honest and sincere. 
</P>
<P>
In return for his loyalty and hard work and involvement, he wanted ours. His 
unspoken standards weren't just high, they felt mountainous. My father wanted 
brains and accomplishments and beauty and charm and good manners and 
independence and imagination and originality and conventionalism and clear 
thinking and obedience and virtue and success and self-discipline, 
self-control, generosity, kindness. 
</P>
<P>
Perfection. 
</P>
<P>
I -- and all my brothers -- bought this model. I believed if I tried harder, I 
could manage it; such was the charm he held for me as a child, and to some 
extent still does. 
</P>
<P>
I now understand why he was intent on our "shining" for him: the poverty and 
humiliation of his childhood was passed to him from his parents, fresh from the 
Armenian massacres of the early 20th Century. His own childhood was barren and 
poor, so he made us feel every finger-painting we did was a Picasso, every 
dance step Pavlova's. His pride and love were to save us from the voids of his 
own childhood. We were more than willing to take the bows before him. 
</P>
<P>
"Soft management" would be the business terminology for the way my father ran 
our lives. He was not an overpowering head of the house. One of the things he 
understood was how much children love the ordinary life adults have access to, 
and from which kids are barred. Marriage, cocktails, cars are as exotic as 
dragons to children. So he took us to R-rated movies, let us watch any 
television show, listen to any record, read any book. There were no 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
At 12, I went to a girlfriend's house after school. I was told that she was not 
allowed to play the record "Hair." It was not even allowed in her house. This 
was 1969. "Well, then, you can come hear it at my house." No, she said. That 
was not possible either. 
</P>
<P>
My splendid father, the man who taught me so much, also taught me character. 
That to be respected -- and have self-respect -- is more important than 
dressing in glitter. You stare life straight in the face and be a person you'd 
like to love and live a life you'd like to live. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional" femininity was presented but not pushed. My father taught me to 
be independent. 
</P>
<P>
I do not think my father ever asked awkward questions about the world, or 
anything much; he was of the generation before introspection and therapy were 
considered crusades. He sees our relationship as self-evident: Of course, 
fathers and daughters adore each other. Are pals. We might spar and box a bit, 
but which pop-and-daughter team hasn't? 
</P>
<P>
We've had our ups and downs, the gentleman and I. Some minor, some epic. They 
pretty much boil down to stubbornness -- both his and mine. For we almost have 
the same way of looking at the world. The world I see is kinder, but then I had 
a loving father, and he didn't.

Ba Tin Swe, president of the Patriotic Youth League, demanded the release of 
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, saying her leadership is 
necessary to tackle the many problems of Myanmar, formerly Burma. Aung San Suu 
Kyi, 45, has been under house arrest since last July because of political 
speeches and rallies. Her party won massive public support in Myanmar's 
elections on May 27, but diplomats have expressed concern that the military 
will try to delay yielding power to civilians.

Imelda Marcos broke down in tears at her racketeering trial in New York during 
testimony that showed how money allegedly plundered from the Philippines went 
to her children.

She was escorted from the courtroom, wearing dark glasses, and was pronounced 
fit after a checkup at the nurse's station. Marcos returned after the lunch 
break looking well. However, Judge John Keenan announced that he had a cold and 
a fever and would recess the trial for the day. It is scheduled to resume 
Tuesday. Marcos allegedly plotted with her husband, former Philippines 
President Ferdinand Marcos, to divert stolen money into real estate investments

BENNETT FEARS RISE IN COCAINE VIOLENCE

A shortage of cocaine indicated by rising prices in some cities may trigger 
increased violence as "the same number of dogs" compete for "a smaller number 
of bones," national drug control director William J. Bennett predicted. He said 
wholesale price increases found by the Drug Enforcement Administration in Los 
Angeles and New York indicate there is a shortage, a conclusion the DEA itself 
has not yet drawn. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as if we are beginning to have positive effect on the flow of cocaine 
into this country," Bennett said. The DEA said a kilogram of cocaine (2.2 
pounds) can fetch as much as $35,000 at wholesale in New York, up from $14,000 
to $18,000 last fall, and $25,000 in Los Angeles, where wholesale prices have 
risen in a similar period from $10,000 per kilogram in lots of 10 or more and 
$15,000 for smaller amounts.

JUSTIFY SEIZING ASSETS OF NORIEGA, U.S. TOLD

A federal judge in Miami demanded that prosecutors in Manuel A. Noriega's drug 
case justify their seizure of all his assets, saying failure to do so violates 
the deposed Panamanian leader's constitutional rights. U.S. District Judge 
William Hoeveler rejected the government's claim that the seizures, which 
involved treaties with third countries, were not subject to judicial review. 
"The government has not only placed defendant's assets out of his reach without 
affording him any meaningful opportunity to be heard, but has indeed done so 
without showing that the assets are tainted by illegal activity," the judge 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
That violates Noriega's constitutional protections against illegal search and 
seizure and effectively deprives him of his right to counsel, he said. Hoeveler 
set a hearing for Wednesday on the matter.

A BANNER DAY;

<P>
FLAG OBSERVANCES COME IN MANY DIFFERENT STRIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Burned by Boy Scouts, frozen by nuclear activists, serenaded by hundreds of 
schoolchildren and marketed to Japanese tourists, Old Glory took center stage 
Thursday on its official national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
From 83-year-old Floyd Foran's front porch to the newest star on the Hollywood 
Walk of Fame, the familiar patchwork of red, white and blue waved on, seemingly 
oblivious to the ongoing debate about its sanctity being waged in the nation's 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Flag Day is the bastard child of patriotic holidays, always upstaged by the 
flashy Fourth of July and the reverent Veterans and Memorial days. Flag Day 
began officially in 1916 and June 14 was chosen because, on that date in 1777, 
the Continental Congress approved the Stars and Stripes as the nation's flag. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday's Supreme Court ruling against a proposed law to protect the flag 
from desecration, followed by President Bush's vow to continue the yearlong 
fight for a constitutional amendment, was a common topic of conversation among 
Flag Day participants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm with the President. If that's what it takes, we should do it," said Thomas 
(Ski) Demski, who has flown a giant flag outside his Long Beach home for the 
last 10 years. "You have to think about what it represents." 
</P>
<P>
On Flag Day, Demski organized his annual flag raising, inviting 500 elementary 
schoolchildren to witness the event. The wind picked up as he used his drill 
motor to raise the 47-by-82-foot flag, causing it to stick on a light and 
necessitating an encore of the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a blue shirt, red shorts and white socks, Venice Beach activist Jerry 
Rubin unveiled his frozen flag at the Federal Building in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
As he pulled a plastic garbage bag off a flag his brother, Marty, had kept in a 
deep freeze since Monday, Rubin's explanation for his antics was filled with 
puns and innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm wondering if anyone is as burned up as I am about this proposed 
constitutional amendment," Rubin said. "It would have a chilling effect on our 
Bill of Rights." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the ice also represented the nuclear weapons freeze supported by his 
group, the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped the frozen flag to the ground, cracking the ice, as 15 reporters and 
photographers recorded the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Constantin Niculescu, who immigrated from Romania six years ago, shook Rubin's 
hand after the media retreated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Republican, I'm totally against flag burning," Niculescu said. "But his 
(Rubin's) protest is much more decent." 
</P>
<P>
Niculescu, who was at the Federal Building seeking a permit to protest 
communist oppression in his homeland, said it is "disgusting" to see the 
American flag burned, but he doesn't mind the burning of Soviet flags, "because 
the red in the Russian flag stands for blood." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Communist Youth Party threatened to steal Rubin's show by 
burning a flag at the Federal Building at the same time. But they never 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Across town at the downtown Federal Building, opponents of U.S. policy in El 
Salvador scrubbed an American flag stained red to symbolize getting the "blood" 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Foran, who has been flying a flag outside his Los Angeles home on virtually all 
national holidays for more than 50 years, called those who chose to deface the 
flag "stupid." But, he said, "if they want to be stupid let them." 
</P>
<P>
He said he flies his flag more out of habit than anything else these days. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm as patriotic as anybody else. I'm an old man." 
</P>
<P>
On Flag Day, Foran's was the only flag flying in his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The local flag burning Thursday did not result in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Six Boy Scouts from a Hollywood area troop retired the flag of the Kingsley 
Manor retirement community Thursday evening by burning it in a barbecue. The 
flag was about 2 years old and very faded and worn out, said the manor's 
security officer, Lt. Dwight C. Dupee. 
</P>
<P>
"They played taps . . . from a tape recording," Dupee said. "It was very nice." 
</P>
<P>
But an anonymous caller to The Times complained that a tattered and dirty flag 
that should be similarly retired still waved over the Witt-Thomas Productions 
building in Vernon. The vacant warehouse was the former sound stage for the 
now-defunct television program "Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
Composer John Philip Sousa was awarded the 1,914th star on Hollywood's Walk of 
Fame, as the U.S. Marine Corps Band played one of his best known marches, 
"Stars and Stripes Forever." Art Bartner, director of the USC marching band, 
which also played at the unveiling, called the tune "our second national 
anthem." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the ceremony, tourists were again walking up and down the row 
of remembrances, stopping to point out Janet Jackson's plaque four stars away. 
</P>
<P>
Don McWhorter, the attendant at the parking lot nearest Souza's star, reflected 
on the significance of Flag Day. As a Korean War veteran, McWhorter said he 
feels protective of the flag, but then again he understands the younger 
generation's cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people see what happened to the veterans of other wars and they don't 
want to fight for their flag anymore," he said.

BROTHERS WERE NOT PLANNING AN ESCAPE; 
</P>
<P>
MENENDEZ CASE: SHERIFF'S OFFICIAL SAYS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE MURDER 
SUSPECTS WERE SEEKING TO FLEE JAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There is no evidence that either Lyle or Erik Menendez, accused of murdering 
their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion, was planning an escape from the 
Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, a Sheriff's Department official told The 
Times on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William Sieber, head of the sheriff's fugitive warrant escape detail, said 
investigators "are unable to validate with any accuracy or certainty that 
either of these two gentlemen played a part in the tampering with the chains 
which were used to secure them." 
</P>
<P>
After a daylong hearing in Santa Monica Superior Court last Friday, a Sheriff's 
Department spokesman told the news media that two links in a chain binding Lyle 
Menendez's ankles had been filed almost through. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, authorities recovered notes from the brothers' cells possibly 
indicating an escape attempt, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the chains and the notes were sent to the sheriff's crime lab for 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"In our professional opinion, the chains were not cut by either of the Menendez 
brothers," Sieber said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the notes and diagrams recovered from the brothers' cells 
were of a building that could not be identified, adding that he could not 
conclude that the notes had anything to do with an escape attempt. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's source who requested anonymity said Thursday that the department 
should have conducted "a more thorough investigation" before releasing details 
of the alleged escape attempt to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Menedez, 22, and his brother Erik, 19, are charged with the Aug. 20 
murders of their parents, entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife, 
Kitty. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers, arrested in March, are being held in County Jail while awaiting a 
preliminary hearing in the highly publicized case. 
</P>
<P>
They had been held in a high-security area of the jail near each other, but 
they were moved farther apart Friday night so they could not communicate while 
the investigation into the alleged escape attempt continued. 
</P>
<P>
Neither brother would answer deputies' questions about a possible escape 
attempt when they were returned to their cells Friday night, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Sieber said the question of how the two links in Lyle Menendez's chain had been 
cut remained unanswered, and that the matter was still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately six notes, handwritten in pencil on yellow legal-size tablets, 
were foiund in the brothers' cells, Sieber said. He said the notes referred to 
"moving from the U.S. to Europe." 
</P>
<P>
But investigators could not conclude that the notes had anything to do with an 
imminent escape attempt, the lieutenant added. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pieces of paper confiscated by a deputy had a drawing on it, 
according to a member of the Menendez family. 
</P>
<P>
Sieber confirmed this and said the drawing, complete with notations of 
stairwells, was of a building that could not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
A relative speculated that Lyle Menendez had been designing a new restaurant 
that he wanted to purchase. He had bought a restaurant last February in 
downtown Princeton, N.J., where he had lived and attended college. He had been 
considering developing a chain of franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Sieber said both the district attorney's office and the court would be notified 
of the sheriff's findings. He added that no new charges would be sought against 
the brothers.

THE SIGN THAT WON'T GO AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe you can't fight City Hall, but George Lindsey and his neighbors are 
finding out that having the bureaucracy in your corner doesn't guarantee 
victory, either. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey, a scriptwriter, lives just north of the Sunset Strip on busy Crescent 
Heights Boulevard. Two doors down, neighbors Albert and Dorothy Adams have 
erected a sign advertising Dorothy Adams' palm and tarot-card reading business. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Lindsey has led a battle to remove the sign, complaining that it 
violates the Hollywood neighborhood's residential zoning. He and some of his 
neighbors have fired off letters, circulated petitions, phoned in complaints 
and sought the help of their councilman. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an amusement park or a country fair with Gypsy caravans," Hilda 
Bohem, who lives up the block from the sign, said in a letter to the Board of 
Zoning Appeals last June. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Higby, another neighbor, called it "an insult to the eye and a threat to 
the property values of a residential neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Says Lindsey: "It's illegal. . . . How would you like to have that sign next to 
your house?" 
</P>
<P>
Not a single city official who has had a hand in the case disagrees with 
Lindsey. The matter is clear, they say: The sign is in violation and must go. 
The Department of Building and Safety has issued the Adamses five orders to 
comply; the Adamses, who have argued that as Gypsies, fortunetelling is part of 
their "constellation of religious beliefs" and should be permitted as a type of 
religious counseling, have lost appeals at every step along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Adams, at her fortunetelling office not far from her home on Sunset 
Boulevard, said she should be allowed to keep her sign and home office because 
others in the neighborhood operate businesses in residences. 
</P>
<P>
The house next to the Adamses, for instance, is occupied by a law firm. But the 
owners of that property, right behind the Coconut Teaszer nightclub, obtained a 
zoning change years ago that allows commercial use. The Adamses' house is the 
last lot on Crescent Heights Boulevard in the R-1 zone, but they will soon be 
applying for a zone variance that would permit their sign, said Jeff Lambert, a 
land-use consultant hired by the couple. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, in language plain as day, the Board of Zoning Appeals issued a 
ruling that should have brought the matter to a swift conclusion. The board 
held that "the determination of the zoning administrator in denying an appeal 
of a determination of the Department of Building and Safety in issuing an Order 
to Comply directing the removal of a non-permitted advertising sign in the R1 
zone" was correct and not subject to further appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In English: The Adamses were finished, and it was finally time for them to take 
the sign down or face criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
But nine months later, the sign is still standing. And the city, thanks to some 
shrewd maneuvering by the Adamses, is back at Square 1 in its efforts to force 
them to take the sign down. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had it," said Lindsey, who recently learned that the city had decided to 
close its original file against the Adamses and begin a new one. "These people 
are using every loophole possible to deter justice." 
</P>
<P>
What happened, explained Building and Safety investigator Steve Baxter, is 
this: When he went out last March to photograph the sign as evidence for a 
criminal case against the Adamses, he discovered that the couple had put up a 
new sign. 
</P>
<P>
"The new one had a black background with white lettering," Baxter said. "The 
old one had a white background with black lettering. And the new one was maybe 
a little bigger. It had the same information on it, but it was obviously not 
the same sign. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give the guy credit, he's pretty clever," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter took news of this latest development back to the city attorney's office, 
where he was told that without current photographs of the original sign, the 
city could not file a case -- a defense attorney would tear it to shreds. 
</P>
<P>
City inspectors had not photographed the sign on each visit because property 
owners usually comply with orders to correct such violations, Baxter said. 
Inspectors do not routinely document violations with photographs unless they 
expect the case to wind up in court. 
</P>
<P>
"There are jobs where you go out and you know it and you act accordingly," 
Baxter said. "We just assumed the guy would remove the sign, and we knew we 
could always take a picture of it. We were surprised it was a new and different 
sign." 
</P>
<P>
Once the city attorney's office declined to file criminal charges, Baxter 
closed the old file and sent it back to Building and Safety senior inspector 
David Lipman to start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Lipman said he will send a field inspector -- with camera -- by the Adamses' 
house this week and issue a new order to tear down the sign. 
</P>
<P>
"I do intend to take a picture with every single order," Lipman said. "I know 
the people (in the neighborhood) feel we're not trying to do everything we can, 
but we are." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Adamses are likely to file more appeals to keep their new sign, it 
could be a while before the case reaches Baxter's desk and he can refer it once 
again to the city attorney for criminal charges. But he is hopeful that that 
day will come. 
</P>
<P>
"I do understand the neighbors' frustration, and I experience a large part of 
it," Baxter said. "I'm not allowed to go there with an ax and take it out. . . 
. Although he (Adams) is not following the rules, you can be sure that the 
Building and Safety Department and the city attorney will be held to the letter 
of the law. And we have to follow the law if we are to take it to court and 
win." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOT IN THE CARDS 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ELECTION CASTS DOUBT ON HOPE LAND SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The results of a Ventura County election has cast doubt on the future of a 
complex land swap between Bob Hope and the National Park Service that would 
turn 5,700 acres of the comedian's mountain property in Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties into parkland. 
</P>
<P>
The election of a new slow-growth member to the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors has reduced the chance that the board will approve the subdivision 
of Hope's Jordan Ranch for a 750-house project, Supervisor John K. Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
That would veto the key provision on which the land swap depends. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's upset election of slow-growth advocate Maria VanderKolk appears to 
have provided the swing vote against the project, Flynn said. Three of the five 
county supervisors who are scheduled to review the project in January now have 
either pledged to vote against it or have voted against it in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances of it passing are slim. If I were the developer, I would feel very 
uncomfortable right now," Flynn said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 9 NEW CHARGES FILED IN KIDNAPING OF ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine charges involving the alleged kidnap and assault of three additional 
victims were filed Thursday against an Immigration and Naturalization Service 
agent accused of abducting illegal immigrants off streets in the San Fernando 
Valley and threatening to deport them unless they had sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
The latest charges bring the total to 17 against James Edward Riley of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Included are allegations that he raped a woman after conducting an 
unauthorized, one-man "raid" at gunpoint on a Van Nuys bar. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, 32, is charged with three counts of kidnaping, three counts of rape and 
one count each of forced oral copulation, attempted forced oral copulation and 
assault with intent to commit rape. Riley is accused of using his position as a 
federal agent to commit the crimes. Riley entered a plea of not guilty to the 
new charges and Van Nuys Municipal Judge Leslie Ann Dunn set a preliminary 
hearing for July 30.

UNLEASHING CREATIVITY; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS CENTER HAS A NO-FAIL APPROACH FOR CULTURALLY DEPRIVED CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children who visit downtown's Inner City Arts Center studio squeal in delight 
and tear toward a great igloo-like structure covered in tan butcher paper and 
decorated in the mysterious hieroglyphics of grade schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
Yards of paper catch the light of a nearby window, transmitting a rich acorn 
glow that beckons the children inside. They do so with near-abandon, scooting 
low through a narrow entryway to gather within and whisper in a special place 
they have created. 
</P>
<P>
None of the children know it, but the "art cave" made by students from a nearby 
elementary school is really a metaphor for the one-of-a-kind arts center, 
opened last fall by an artist and a real estate financier as a haven for the 
impoverished and culturally undernourished children of the city's urban core. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at all the graffiti in the city and I think sometimes these young 
people are crying out to express themselves," said artist Bob Bates, director 
and co-founder of Inner City Arts. "If we can show children who come to us that 
there's a channel for this, I believe we can get them to believe in themselves 
and love who they are." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 600 children from downtown's 9th Street Elementary School and Para Los 
Ninos Latchkey program come to the huge art studio on Olympic Boulevard near 
Central Avenue each week, either to attend one-hour classes or to spend the 
after-school hours as part of the latchkey program. 
</P>
<P>
They come from some of the city's most troubled spots, from crowded brick 
apartments near MacArthur Park and dank single room hotels on Skid Row. For 
most, life has not offered the richness that shapes a more affluent child: no 
wide green lawn and plenty of toys to play with, no summer camp, no crafts with 
mom or dad. 
</P>
<P>
There is a deep conviction among Bates, a former art teacher at the University 
of Miami, and other teachers at Inner City Arts that they must reawaken the 
muffled creative urges that fuel a child's learning and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
In this lofty, warm room stocked with paints, ceramics, a kiln, a piano, a 
video camera, and, of course, the art cave, that creative force is being let 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
"We love art class and we wish we could come every day but we get to come two 
days," said Anna Maria Diaz, 11. "There's nothing like this in regular school 
and I don't think anywhere else, even. Here we've done animals and houses and 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. We love ceramics and we love painting!" 
</P>
<P>
Almost entirely funded from private sources, the center offers free one-hour 
classes to children from 9th Street Elementary School who walk with their 
teachers from the school, at Stanford and Towne avenues near Skid Row, to the 
studio to attend class as part of their regular school day. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking badly needed buses, Inner City Arts runs an outreach class in which 
program teachers visit schools whose children cannot get to the studio. Each 
week, they visit 270 children at Utah, San Pedro and 28th Street elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate financier Irwin Jaeger put up $137,000 to create the Inner City 
Arts Center, leasing the large studio in a neighborhood of low-slung industrial 
buildings. Jaeger, a Beverly Hills resident, oversees a private foundation that 
is donating and raising funds to expand the studio to serve other schools. 
Jaeger hopes the studio can one day serve 5,500 inner-city children. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike public school, the Inner City Arts program follows few rules. Classes 
are taught not by trained teachers, but by professional artists such as Bob 
Nydam, Summer Lowe and Gail Bates. There are no grades, no tests, no work 
sheets -- and no failures. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we are working with the creative minds and hearts of the children, 
when we give materials to them they make and create things that we adults 
cannot even conceive," said Bob Bates, a lanky and soft-spoken man who always 
hovers near the children, and whom they call simply "Bob." 
</P>
<P>
Debra Sanders, a single mother who lives with her brother at the Premier Towers 
apartment on a tattered stretch of Spring Street downtown, said it is a 
constant struggle to provide "a real childhood" for her daughter, Angel, a 
7-year-old student at 9th Street school. 
</P>
<P>
The close-knit mother and daughter have been homeless once before, and live 
only in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"Angel can go out of the apartment and see a bum on the street and that can 
bring a lot onto any child," Sanders said. "That's where the art center comes 
in. You can tell your kid they're the greatest all day long, but When somebody 
else says it and gives them a chance to prove it, that makes all the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
One recent day, 5th- and 6th-graders from 9th Street were daubing bright colors 
onto their handmade ceramics, readying them for the last firing in the kiln. 
</P>
<P>
Excited jostling flared up as a line formed to use a big jar of green paint. It 
was the key ingredient for completing a handcrafted Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 
replica, and there were nearly a dozen versions of the popular creature 
clutched in small hands. 
</P>
<P>
But as is always the way at Inner City Arts, no child felt constrained to 
follow the pack. Ivan Munoz, 10, painstakingly applied blue paint to tiny clay 
clothing and put a removable hat on a figurine of a Dodger baseball player 
created by a friend. It was, Ivan said, a team project. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in latchkey and after school we get to come here again, and it's the 
best," Ivan said. "Then, after that, my dad comes and picks me up, but you know 
what? I'm not always ready to go!" 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the studio grew from a casual conversation Bob Bates and Jaeger 
had a few years ago about helping children. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are sponges who absorb everything, and we know we are giving them a 
chance to absorb the right things," said Jaeger, a frequent and popular visitor 
to the studio. "This is all about giving kids the equal opportunity so that 
they can stay equal as adults." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy has earned the art center the respect of parents and of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Peifer, principal of the 9th Street school, said the entire school is 
enrolled in the federal free lunch program because so many students come from 
low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
"These children are not just needy in monetary terms," Peifer said, "and if 
people go and see what is happening they will know how wonderful this program 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Peifer, who bemoans the small amount of school district money used to run arts 
and music programs, said one major benefit of Inner City Arts "is just the 
space, the bigness, the airiness, the size of a place where a child can be free 
who lives in pretty cramped quarters." 
</P>
<P>
She said the district pays about 1% of the cost of the Inner City Arts program. 
</P>
<P>
But the center does get help. 
</P>
<P>
Donations arrive at the studio weekly, ranging from loads of tempera for 
painting to shipments of foam and other basic building blocks for creating art. 
Rega Petlin, director of development at the studio, said volunteers have begun 
to appear at the front door, just wanting to give their time. 
</P>
<P>
"One woman comes faithfully every Tuesday and helps run the office," Petlin 
said. "She said she just wants to be near the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all the good, there is the constant reminder that just outside the 
front door, a harsh world awaits these children. A homeless woman lives beside 
the center, and Bates has hired her at $5 an hour to clean up the studio. 
</P>
<P>
Bates sees each new twist and turn as a chance to show children how to maintain 
their self-worth in an increasingly uncertain urban milieu. 
</P>
<P>
"I see these children rising above incredible problems and incredible 
adversity," he said. "If we can give them the tools to do that, we will have a 
better culture for it."

COASTAL PANEL BLOCKS MALIBU HOME BUILDER; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: PROPERTY OWNER IS ACCUSED OF GROSSLY EXCEEDING LIMITS OF HIS 
GRADING PERMIT. ONE COMMISSIONER CALLS IT AN 'ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME.'

In what environmentalists hailed as a stern message to developers in 
California's coastal zone, the state Coastal Commission has revoked the permit 
of a Malibu developer accused of grading 14 times the amount of earth his 
permit allowed. 
</P>
<P>
By an 8-3 vote, the state panel Wednesday night revoked the permit of developer 
Sheldon Gordon to build four luxury homes on 184 acres he owns in Malibu's 
exclusive Sweetwater Canyon area. Several commissioners accused Gordon of 
misleading them about the amount of grading involved, and said that they never 
would have approved the work had they known. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who owns the Ma Maison Sofitel Hotel in West Los Angeles, is accused of 
grading 560,000 cubic yards of earth, despite a permit that was to have limited 
the grading to 40,000 cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
While halting future development of the rugged hill property overlooking the 
Pacific Ocean, the action left unresolved what may be done to restore the 
damage caused by the grading. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents whose homes are near the property had opposed the revocation, 
saying that the $1 million Gordon has spent to restore some of the damage is 
not enough, and that unless he is allowed to complete the project heavy rains 
are likely to cause landslides in the exposed hills. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, who lives in Malibu and who voted to revoke the 
permit, called the grading "a project of obscene proportions," and added, "To 
do this much damage for the sake of four estates is just an environmental 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
Local environmentalists called it the worst violation of its type they can 
recall in the Malibu area. 
</P>
<P>
"He chopped down a mountain, and now he's having to face the consequences," 
said community activist Sara Wan, whose husband, Larry, was recently elected to 
Malibu's future city council. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's attorney, Joseph Petrillo, a former coastal commissioner who helped 
write the state Coastal Act, indicated that his client will go to court, if 
necessary, to overturn the panel's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a simple situation where some guy got it into his head to say he's 
not going to bother with obtaining permits, that he's going to go out and grade 
whatever it is he wants," Petrillo said. "My client didn't try to hide anything 
from anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said that he was not made aware by project engineers of the amount of 
grading involved until after the work was done. However, he said that once he 
learned of the mistake, he did not try to pull the wool over the commission's 
eyes. He said the commission staff had access to information about the progress 
of the work early on and should have been able to deduce that more grading was 
involved than originally stated. 
</P>
<P>
He said the revocation was "politically motivated" and was especially critical 
of commissioner Glickfeld. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm her target," he said. "I've got this big bull's-eye on my 
forehead, and people want to make me out as some kind of criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who has lived in Malibu for 15 years, bought the property five years 
ago intending to build a home there and devote most of the acreage to pasture 
land for some of his prize-winning jumping horses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the commission approved the permit enabling him to subdivide the 
property into four estates, each with at least 40 acres, but imposed several 
conditions, including the grading limit. 
</P>
<P>
After investigators for the Coastal Commission discovered the grading 
violations early last year, the panel immediately issued a stop-work order, and 
later ordered Gordon to take steps to correct the damage. 
</P>
<P>
The developer said that he has spent more than $1 million in the last year to 
recontour some of the damaged slopes in the hope that the commission would 
ultimately approve his request to go forward with the work. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent $10 million out there, including the purchase price, and it's 
costing me $100,000 a month in interest charges while the work is being held 
up, and I think I deserved better than that," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
However, that argument did not impress Glickfeld. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Petrillo says that his client is the innocent victim of bad representation 
by a consulting engineer, and that he had never done a residential subdivision 
in the coastal zone," Glickfeld said. "Well, I'm sorry, that's no excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon developed the Beverly Center in Los Angeles, and his company was also 
the developer of the San Francisco Centre, a huge shopping complex here that 
opened last year.

FOCUS ON THE FAMILY GROUP PLANS TO MOVE; 
</P>
<P>
MINISTRY: THE CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATION IN POMONA THAT HAS GROWN INTO A 
$63-MILLION-A-YEAR MEDIA EMPIRE INTENDS TO RELOCATE TO COLORADO SPRINGS.

<P>
Focus on the Family, which was founded by psychologist James Dobson 13 years 
ago to promote Christian family values and has grown into a $63-million-a-year 
media empire, announced Thursday that it has outgrown its headquarters in 
Pomona and plans to move to Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, the organization's president, said the move is contingent on the sale 
of its property in Pomona, but the move could occur 18 months to two years 
after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Nelson, executive vice president, said the 750 employees at the Pomona 
headquarters were told of the plan Thursday and will be offered the chance to 
transfer to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Mayor Donna Smith said she is disappointed by the decision because of 
the loss of jobs and the loss of a valuable "ministry that is desperately 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson said that although the nonprofit organization has strong support in 
California, most of its work -- answering a volume of mail that reaches 10,000 
letters a day and preparing radio programs -- can be done just as easily in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said Focus on the Family was faced with the alternative of constructing 
a high-rise office building on its 13-acre site in Pomona or finding a larger 
site elsewhere to meet its expansion needs. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the expense of high-rise construction and the higher labor and 
operating costs in California, he said, it will be cheaper to move to Colorado. 
"It will also be cheaper for our employees to live there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, who was an associate clinical professor of pediatrics at USC for 14 
years, started Focus on the Family in 1977 after writing a series of popular 
books on parenting and marriage from a conservative Christian perspective. He 
started with one secretary in a two-room office in Arcadia, expanded to a dozen 
employees in 1980 and now runs an organization that includes a lobbying arm in 
Washington and a Canadian branch in Vancouver. Its radio broadcasts reach an 
estimated 1 million listeners on 1,450 stations in the United States and 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson gained national attention in 1989 when he interviewed serial killer Ted 
Bundy in Florida shortly before his execution and recorded on videotape Bundy's 
claim that his crimes were influenced by pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said Colorado Springs was selected because of a gift of $4 million from 
the El Pomar Foundation, contingent upon the move. The foundation was 
established in 1937 by Spencer Penrose, who made a fortune in gold in Colorado. 
The foundation makes grants exclusively to groups in Colorado.

Portray them as villainous, if you must. There certainly is a wealth of 
material, from Bill Laimbeer's sneer to that self-dubbed "Bad Boy" veneer, to 
support the branding of America's Most Hated Team on the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
But also call them NBA champions. Do not begrudge them greatness. The Pistons, 
who won their first title last season against the injury-depleted Lakers, 
confirmed their place in dominating fashion in this NBA finals series by 
beating the Portland Trail Blazers in five games for consecutive titles. 
</P>
<P>
No what-ifs or injury-tainted victories this time. With a 92-90 victory 
Thursday night in Game 5, coming on Vinnie Johnson's off-balance, 14-foot jump 
shot with 0.7 seconds left, the Pistons proved superior from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what our place in history will be; that's for others to decide," 
Laimbeer said. "But we don't think any team can touch us at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't talk about it much, but we carried a little bit of a grudge this 
year because we didn't get the respect we deserved. Because people didn't think 
we deserved it last season. We can talk about it now, because I think people 
have finally recognized just how special and good a team we are." 
</P>
<P>
Only the third team to win consecutive championships, the Pistons now can 
justifiably be compared with the great Boston Celtic and Laker teams. 
</P>
<P>
Unquestionably, Isiah Thomas' dominance in this series may forever obliterate 
those "overrated" whispers sometimes heard about the Piston guard around the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
In winning the series most valuable player award, Thomas almost single-handedly 
won Game 1 with a classic shooting display, his defense stifled Portland point 
guard Terry Porter and, all told, he averaged 27.6 points and shot 54.2% for 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
All Thomas did in Game 5 was score 29 points, survive a bloodied nose from a 
Jerome Kersey forearm, sink the tying basket with 36 seconds left in a 9-0 
Piston comeback and then set up Johnson for the game-winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We never talked about it all season, but for the past four to five years, we 
felt like we were one of the best teams in the history of basketball," Thomas 
said. "We wanted to repeat as champions, but not so much to prove it to anybody 
else, just for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
No, that wouldn't be the Piston way. They always have been renegades of sorts, 
thumbing their noses at the Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, total respect previously had eluded the Pistons. Maybe it was 
their image. Maybe it was because they have no definitive star and they depend 
on such mundane areas as defense, depth and a balanced offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Not enough can be said about this team," Piston Coach Chuck Daly said. "It's 
so defensively sound, and deep, and they operate on offense so well because 
they are unselfish. All those things make them a great team." 
</P>
<P>
Those virtues were never more evident than in this series. Three of the 
Pistons' four victories were close games in which they made the big plays and 
showed more poise than the Trail Blazers, who advanced to the finals for the 
first time since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a good way to end the series," said Trail Blazer guard Clyde 
Drexler, who fouled out during the Pistons' final run. "In our wildest beliefs, 
we didn't imagine we would lose three straight at home." 
</P>
<P>
Said Portland Coach Rick Adelman: "Any team that can beat us three times in our 
own building is a great one, and that's why the Pistons are the champions." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, trailing by seven points with 2:02 left Thursday, could have 
packed it in and figured they could win the series in Michigan. But that would 
have been out of character. 
</P>
<P>
They said coming in that they enjoy the satisfaction of winning the title on 
the road, as they did in the Forum last season. They also wanted the 
distinction of being the first team to win three consecutive road games since 
the NBA switched to the 2-3-2 format in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how they did it: 
</P>
<P>
First, and perhaps most important, Thomas returned. He had left with about 
seven minutes to play after running headlong into Kersey's forearm during a 
chase for a loose ball. Thomas' swollen nose would not stop bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
When the cobwebs left and the blood clotted, Thomas saw that the Pistons 
trailed, 90-83. But Johnson made the first dent into the deficit by beating 
defender Danny Young for a jumper with 1:50 left. Drexler fouled Johnson -- his 
sixth -- and the accompanying free throw sliced the Trail Blazer lead to 90-86. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Duckworth (21 points) then missed an open jumper with 1:32 left, and 
Johnson countered by sinking a jumper with 1:21 left to pull Detroit within 
two. Duckworth tried again, muscling in against Laimbeer, playing with five 
fouls. But the Portland center missed a short hook and, after a jump ball, 
Thomas sank a running jumper with 36 seconds left to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen seconds later, the Pistons' defense kicked in again. Pressured by 
Thomas, Porter tried to drive the lane but was cut off. His pass to Kersey 
sailed out of bounds with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Pistons' ball. Pistons' game. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what the brazen Pistons were telling each other during a 
timeout to set up the last play. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I never thought about overtime," guard Joe Dumars said. 
"I thought someone on the floor for us would make the winning shot. That's the 
kind of confidence I have in this team." 
</P>
<P>
Daly, perhaps coaching his last game as an offer from NBC looms, designed a 
play in which Thomas had the ball at the top of the key and two players were 
spread out in each corner. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas dribbled down the clock, then Johnson moved forward to receive the pass 
with about three seconds left. Johnson took a dribble and tried to square to 
the basket. He was off balance when he released the ball, but that is Johnson's 
style. 
</P>
<P>
It swished with 0.7 seconds left for a 92-90 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We got so many guys who can make that shot, it just happened to be me this 
time," Johnson said. "I knew, with time running out, I couldn't get the ball 
back to Isiah. So I took one dribble. I gave a shoulder move to get more open. 
The shot didn't feel good when I released it, but when it went in, I felt 
good." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons had a lot to feel good about. They simply dominated the Trail 
Blazers. Portland had tied Detroit for the league's second best regular-season 
record, but the Pistons clearly were better. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want this to sound immodest, but we were the better basketball team," 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Why should the Pistons be modest now? Their confident swagger and elitist 
attitude about doing whatever it takes to win has made them the NBA's elite 
team, maybe one of the best ever. "I don't know how long we'll last on top," 
Laimbeer said. "But we'll enjoy it while it lasts." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman wants to get to the top -- soon. "We're trying to build something here, 
and hopefully this is our first step toward winning a championship," he said. 
"I hope we will be back next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to take a couple of days to get over the disappointment of 
this loss. But when we look back on things, and what we accomplished this year, 
I think everybody should feel proud." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, unlike another familiar team that won won back-to-back titles, did 
not talk about a "three-peat." They could not even firm up their plans for next 
week, let alone next season. 
</P>
<P>
Daly, 59, eluded questions of his future as expertly as his team dodged 
repeated Trail Blazer threats. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Daly said when asked whether he will return for another season. 
"I kind of like coaching. I've gotten reasonably good at it. I'm just going to 
take my time and see what happens. I want to enjoy this. Not too many coaches 
get the opportunity to savor back-to-back world championships." 
</P>
<P>
And, will this veteran group -- average age 30.4 -- be able to succeed again, 
especially if they have to do it under a new coach and new system? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how long it will last," Laimbeer said. "And I don't care. We're 
the best right now, OK?"

JIM MURRAY: CHAMP TAKES IT ON THE CHIN

MEDINAH, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you like to see a great champion, eyes glazed, rubber-legged, on the ropes, 
cut and bleeding before the onslaught of some eager young bull; if your bag was 
Louis' head hitting the bottom rope, Dempsey groping to see where Tunney had 
just gone; if you liked to see Willie Mays unable to get around on the fastball 
anymore, the 90th U.S. Open Thursday was right up your alley. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't a golfer who was on his last legs, it was the course. 
</P>
<P>
Medinah is one of the great competitors of golf, 7,195 yards of brawling 
infighting and counterpunching. If it were human, its name would be Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's bleeding from every pore today. It was knocked down 20 times in the 
first round. If this were a fight, the ref would be looking at it quizzically 
or calling the doctor in the ring to shine a light in its eyes. Guys named 
Billy Ray Brown are knocking it through the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
It's the function of a great Open course to weed out the ribbon clerks in the 
first rounds, to send the marginal players back to the bus depot or the feeder 
airlines and home. 
</P>
<P>
But the ribbon clerks are mopping up the floor with Medinah. It's floundering 
around the ring apron looking for its mouthpiece. 
</P>
<P>
It would be one thing if the great names of golf were taking this liberty with 
the old champ. But how do the names of Tim (The Other) Simpson, Steve Jones, 
Mike Donald, Bob Gilder, Mark Brooks, John Huston -- the one who didn't direct 
"The African Queen" -- and Tom Byrum grab you? Are you ready for Emlyn Aubrey? 
</P>
<P>
Those are the guys ahead on all cards in this title fight. Medinah has lumps 
all over it from guys who have to rank as club fighters in the hierarchy of 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
But the old guard can't seem to lay a glove on the old pug, even though its 
hands are down at its side and it's looking up at the clock and clinching at 
every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange, who is trying to become only the second guy in history to win 
three Opens in a row, was beside himself with rage and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"Medinah was defenseless today," he fumed as he came into the press tent after 
a round of 73. "Medinah was ready to be taken. It'll never play easier than it 
did today." 
</P>
<P>
An overnight rain that sogged the fairways and made the greens as easy to hold 
as a pub dart board combined to defang the course, where three over par won the 
Open the last time it was played here. 
</P>
<P>
It's downright embarrassing. Curtis Strange, who is harder on Curtis Strange 
than his worst enemy would be, couldn't believe he let the course off the hook. 
Curtis was in a bag-kicking, club-mashing mood as he reflected on how he had 
squandered his chances. 
</P>
<P>
True to the code of the professional golfer, Strange was not about to cop out 
entirely. You have to understand that no golfer can let his self-esteem get so 
low as to blame his tee-to-green game. It is always putting, that sissy part of 
golf, that betrays him. The last golfer to admit he was putting well was Auld 
Tom Morris -- or, maybe, Laurie Auchterlonie. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand, you don't expect to make every putt," he acknowledged 
carefully. "But you do expect to stroke the ball so that you don't miss the 
putt before contact is even made." 
</P>
<P>
As Exhibit A, Curtis offered his card, showing a trio of three-putt greens, two 
putts missed under six feet, one putt missed under four feet and two putts 
missed under 12 feet. His putter should have had rattles. 
</P>
<P>
Strange was not the only favorite to falter, just the most visible. 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros disappeared into the trees and emerged 74 shots later, not 
catastrophic but hardly encouraging. Tom Kite put up a 75. Greg Norman slashed 
his way to a 72, ordinarily a respectable Open score but good only for the 
fringes on this day when 50-odd players shot par or better. 
</P>
<P>
Can Medinah get off the floor and mix it up with this bunch? Is it a good, game 
course or have the Midwest thundershowers turned it into a canvasback? Has it 
been knocked out in one round? A Joe Louis bum-of-the-month equivalent? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we've seen the last of Medinah yet," cautioned Strange. "I don't 
think Medinah is through with us yet." 
</P>
<P>
Predicted Jack Nicklaus, "Medinah will ultimately win. It always has." 
</P>
<P>
Could be. But it had taken a standing eight-count as of the close of business 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The first 18 holes of a U.S. Open are usually like the first rounds of a 
heavyweight championship fight, the first few laps of an Indy 500. The veterans 
are content to jab, clinch, back off the pedal, hit the brake, feel their way 
into the contest, find the trouble, size up the problem. The rookies fly at the 
course's throat. They're reckless, chance-taking. They make a birdie and their 
spirits soar: "Damn! I could do something here!" 
</P>
<P>
Medinah this week is getting respect only from the wilier older players. Do 
they have too much respect for this old campaigner? Can't they see its reflexes 
are slowed, its punch gone? 
</P>
<P>
There's an old saying: "If you shoot at a king, kill him." The golfers may yet 
wish they could have. As long as the old boy can stay up, it still has a 
puncher's chance. 
</P>
<P>
"All it needs is for the wind to come up and the greens to dry out," warned 
Nicklaus, who should know. 
</P>
<P>
And if that happens, we got Rocky VI and VII. Not for the squeamish.

<P>
They stood at the entrance of the hotel in which baseball's owners were 
discussing National League expansion Thursday and chanted, "Let's go Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
About 150 Buffalo boosters had arrived by bus to try to influence the selection 
of two new cities in September of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
They might not have had the desired effect. 
</P>
<P>
Said one member of the commissioner's office, "One of the drawbacks of the 
Buffalo area is its proximity in driving distance to three major league cities 
-- Cleveland, New York and Toronto. This just re-emphasizes that." 
</P>
<P>
The game has begun, with geography and demographics just part of the 
consideration as the National League expands for the first time since 1969, 
ultimately achieving symmetry with the 14-team American League. The expansion 
teams will begin play in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The timetable was outlined at the conclusion of a joint meeting of American and 
National league owners Thursday by Commissioner Fay Vincent, National League 
President Bill White and the chairman of the league's expansion committee, 
Douglas Danforth, who is also chairman of the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Danforth said there had been no decision on franchise fees and would not 
comment on speculation that fees will be $50 million to $100 million per team. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only tell you that it will be more than $10 million," he said, alluding 
to the amount charged Montreal and San Diego in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a deposit required when interested groups and individuals return 
the official questionnaires that will be available in July. 
</P>
<P>
Then: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The expansion committee will ask prospective owners to make presentations 
in New York before Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The committee will cut to a "short list" of five or six by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The prospective cities or areas will be visited during the first quarter of 
1991, with the committee making initial recommendations at the June ownership 
meeting and a final recommendation at the September meeting, at which a vote 
will be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new clubs will be eligible to field minor league teams in 1992 and 
participate in the amateur draft of that year, preceding a dispersal draft in 
November, when each select 36 players from the 12 National League teams. 
</P>
<P>
Danforth said no decision had been reached on the possibility of the American 
League's supplying players in the dispersal draft, but that would be at odds 
with previous expansions and would force the National League to share the 
franchise fees with the American League, an unlikely consideration. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the new teams would not receive national TV income in 1993, the 
last year of the current contract. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo, of course, is one of only several cities or areas under consideration. 
Among the others: Tampa-St. Petersburg, Denver, Orlando, Miami, Washington, 
Phoenix and Northern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Danforth and Vincent stressed the need for local ownership and said the 
preference was for baseball-only stadiums with grass fields and no domes, but 
in any case baseball must be the primary tenant. 
</P>
<P>
Danforth added that the expansion teams would be allowed to play in minor 
league facilities for a year or two, but only if new stadiums were being 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
He said there are no geographical limitations, that the committee could chose 
two East Coast cities rather than two from different parts of the country, and 
that the possibility of National League realignment has been discussed only in 
a general way. 
</P>
<P>
That discussion, it was learned, has centered on the possibility of new teams 
in Denver and Florida, prompting possible realignment along the following 
lines: 
</P>
<P>
West: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Houston, Denver, St. Louis, 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
East: Atlanta, Florida, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Montreal and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Said the general manager of one Eastern Division team: "As much as it makes 
sense geographically, I believe the Cubs and Cardinals would resist moving to a 
new division because of the loss of established rivalries." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to expand now, when many baseball people contend there is not 
enough talent to stock two new teams, represents a response to Congressional 
pressure regarding the possible loss of baseball's antitrust exemption. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring that up every time I go to Washington," Vincent said, adding that 
it is Congress' desire to have six new teams by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't rule anything out, but we have made no commitment beyond these two. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complicated process, and what I have said to Washington is, 'Let us see 
how these two develop first.' " 
</P>
<P>
In other business, the joint ownership voted approval for the San Francisco 
Giants to move to Santa Clara if that city approves construction of a new 
stadium, which is expected to be a ballot issue there this fall.

NEW-LOOK WINFIELD IS FINALLY PRODUCING; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: SINCE CORRECTING A FLAW IN HIS BATTING STANCE, HE HAS BEEN HITTING AS 
WELL AS HE DID DURING HIS GLORY YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
Dave Winfield's back. 
</P>
<P>
Is fine. 
</P>
<P>
His robust physical condition is one reason Winfield is back at the level of 
excellence he knew he could regain, having overcome the obstacles of advanced 
age -- 38 -- and surgery on a herniated disk in his lower spine less than 18 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
A change of scenery and a change in his batting stance have evoked memories of 
the Winfield who terrorized American League pitching as recently as 1988, when 
he hit .322 with 25 home runs and 107 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
The Winfield of the past two weeks isn't the Winfield who hit .213 in a 
part-time role with a club that didn't want him. This Winfield has hit in seven 
consecutive games and is 10 for 26 during the span with three doubles, four 
homers and eight RBIs. This is the Winfield the Angels had hoped they would get 
when they acquired him from the New York Yankees last month for pitcher Mike 
Witt. 
</P>
<P>
"Presence, all those things can only go so far. It needs to be substantiated," 
said Angel Manager Doug Rader, who played with Winfield in San Diego near the 
end of his career and the beginning of Winfield's. "To David's credit, he's 
been able to pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
To Winfield, it's simple. He's enjoying himself, free of the rancorous feuds he 
had with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner and the tabloid headlines that detail 
everyday life among the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"Just being there in the lineup everyday in right (field), my position, hitting 
in a good slot in the lineup, that's what it is," said Winfield, who is batting 
.256 with the Angels -- 21 for 82 -- and .238 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at home here. I've gotten my clothes here, gotten kind of organized. Plus, 
when you're playing well in front of new people, I look at it each day as 
trying to build fans. When you show those fans you can contribute, you feel 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
Showing his new teammates that he could contribute was also important to 
Winfield, who had been platooned this season with the Yankees and had only six 
RBIs in 20 games with them. He sensed the Angels' doubts when he joined the 
club, a feeling that has dissolved. The Angels, who open a six-game trip today 
in Detroit against the Tigers, are 14-6 in games Winfield has started. His six 
homers with the Angels have given him 365 for his career, 35th on the all-time 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to be (reserved). I knew I could play but I wasn't given the chance 
in New York," said Winfield. "A couple of things Doug Rader said and did helped 
me. He said, 'We're going to play you,' and he did. That meant a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Watching videotapes of at-bats from 1987 meant the difference for Winfield. 
Baseball's active RBI leader with 1,457 hadn't lost his bat-speed, a reliable 
measure of a hitter's ability and a skill that, when lost, cannot be recovered. 
The flaw was correctable, and it was done quickly by Winfield, an eager 
student. 
</P>
<P>
"He stuck too close to the plate when he came here. He moved away from the 
plate, and everything fell into place," said Deron Johnson, the Angels' hitting 
instructor. "He took extra batting practice and really worked hard. He's a real 
pro. It's a privilege and pleasure to work with him. . . . He's strong, wants 
to get extension and now he's able to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the tapes Winfield watched were sent to him by the Yankees. He was able 
to find others among his transported belongings. 
</P>
<P>
"You can practice all you want, but I was practicing from an uncomfortable 
position or base at home plate," he said. "I had to review some mechanics, my 
approach. I had the same stuff as far back as '86 and '87. I do it the same way 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"It had to do with plate coverage for me and a couple of other things. My style 
is such that if one thing is wrong or out of sync, a lot of things are. Only 
people that watched me for a while or worked with me would know, and my new 
team didn't know. Doug said he saw things, but I had to see it for myself 
before things clicked in. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference (since his adjustments) has been tremendous -- everything 
(relative to) hitting the ball consistently well to all fields, for a better 
average, more production and more confidence. That underlies everything." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield was always confident that he could rebound from his back surgery. The 
back dogged him through the 1988 season and finally "gave out" in early '89, 
leading to the operation at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic at Centinela 
Hospital Medical Center. He is dedicated to his stretching routines and was in 
excellent condition when he came to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see how people could wonder, how they could say, 'He had a year off. 
He's 38. How could he come back?' " he said. "You look at Nolan Ryan, Carlton 
Fisk; they're still playing, and I'm in better shape than all those guys. 
</P>
<P>
"Now people see and are getting the first exposure to what I can do. It's a 
good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield said he has no regrets over leaving the Yankees. He examines Yankee 
box scores and knows that Mel Hall recently decried a lack of leadership, that 
Don Mattingly threw his helmet in frustration and, of course, that Bucky Dent 
-- who reduced him to the role of bit player -- was fired. He watches and 
listens and refrains from comment, except to say there are certain individuals 
he wishes well and that he's glad he's an ex-Yankee. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask, 'Do you guys think you can catch the Oakland A's?' We're not 
afraid. We're not scared," Winfield said. "It's a big mountain to climb, but we 
probably have a better chance (of winning the division) here than the Yankees 
might in their division."

Cash-laden Japanese are going to horse races in growing numbers, boosting 
profits to record levels, says a government report issued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Combined profits at 34 regional race tracks across Japan reached a record 
annual high of $5.5 billion in fiscal 1989 ending March 1990, according to a 
spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The figure represented an 18% increase over the previous year's profits, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of people are going to the races these days because it's become a 
popular thing to do," he said.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
SPAWR HASN'T LOST EYE FOR RUNNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Spawr isn't hard to find during the day at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, the trainer is perched alongside the paddock, checking out 
the horses in the next race. Anyone close to Spawr, 50, takes notice when he 
makes a mark next to a horse's name on his program. 
</P>
<P>
A 2-year-old first-time starter in Wednesday's fourth race was worthy of such a 
notation. 
</P>
<P>
"On conformation, I thought he was the best looking horse in the field," said 
Spawr. 
</P>
<P>
The thoroughbred in question was My Man Tarzan. And the 2-year-old, first-time 
starter performed like Tarzan, drawing away in the final stages, winning by two 
lengths and paying $92.20. 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty more evidence supporting Spawr's eye for a horse. 
</P>
<P>
One of the sharper players of the claiming game, he was voted the top trainer 
at Santa Anita by those who covered the meeting for a season where he won with 
nearly 30% of his runners, 24 of 81. 
</P>
<P>
Spawr isn't clicking with the same regularity at Hollywood Park, but he is 
hardly having a slow season and he has been a little unlucky. He has eight wins 
and 12 seconds in 43 starts and lost one victory when Sperry was disqualified 
in last Sunday's ninth race. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has become more visible in the last couple of years, Spawr has done 
well with some other shrewd purchases in the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
Restage, claimed for $12,500, went on to earn more than $250,000 and won 17 
races. Mister Gennaro, taken for $32,000, developed into a crack sprinter. 
Included among his triumphs was a 1:07 4/5 score in the 1986 Phoenix Gold Cup 
at Turf Paradise. Sensational Star, also a $32,000 claimer, moved up the 
ladder, scoring his biggest victory in Hollywood Park's Triple Bend Handicap 
just over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, there have been several horses Spawr claimed, then won with the first 
time he started them -- Lighest Ray, Reassured, Showmanship, Chapperal Motel 
and Inquisitorial, to name a few. So handicappers have learned to pay special 
attention to Spawr's claimers. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at a lot of things," he said. "I look at soundness, I look at the 
(Daily Racing) Form and I try to catch a horse I think might improve or a horse 
that I feel is on the way up. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I'll see little signs that maybe a horse is changing and, if I like 
the way they look in the paddock, I might claim them." 
</P>
<P>
Spawr can be spotted in his usual place even before the nonclaiming races. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps polish your eye," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Bell, Spawr was introduced to racing by a neighbor while he was in high 
school in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport fascinated me," he said. "The more I learned, the more I wanted to 
learn. And I'm still learning. I wanted to know what made (the horses) tick." 
</P>
<P>
Spawr had plenty of racing-related occupations before going on his own 13 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
His first job was holding horses for a blacksmith. He served as a groom for 
Jerry Fanning and the late Wally Dunn, who trained, among others, Colorado 
King. He broke yearlings and helped open and managed the Chino Veterinary 
Hospital. He also worked as an assistant to Joe Manzi, who died at the 
beginning of the 1989 Hollywood Park spring-summer meeting. 
</P>
<P>
From modest beginnings -- Spawr started his training career with five horses in 
Northern California -- he now has a barn with 47 residents. In a transient 
business, much of his help has remained with him through the years. He hopes to 
expand and set up two stables. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Spawr's recent success has helped him pick up new clients. Earlier 
this week, he took over Dominant Dancer, who had fallen on hard times but was 
one of last year's best 2-year-old fillies. Spawr succeeds Jack Van Berg, who 
had replaced Don Harper. 
</P>
<P>
"When (co-owner) Jamie (Schloss) came to me, he said he wasn't doing well with 
a good horse, I've been doing well with claimers, so see what you can do with a 
good horse," said Spawr. "(Dominant Dancer) just needs a little bit of time. I 
think she's stressed." 
</P>
<P>
Form prevailed on a day on which there was a double carry-over in the Pick Six. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody had isolated six winners on Sunday or Wednesday, so there was a pool of 
$328,803.28 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Only two horses paid in double figures -- Svelte and J.D.'s Love -- so there 
were 298 perfect tickets, each worth $2,258. The total Pick Six pool was 
$861,110. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
According to track sources, King owner Bruce McNall's election to Hollywood 
Park's board of directors is imminent. McNall has been involved in racing for 
many years and his Summa Stable has featured runners such as Trempolino, Dahar 
and Track Robbery, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Garcia moved into sole possession of second place in the jockey standings 
with three winners Thursday. He took the opener on Make it Quick, the third on 
J.D.'s Love and the ninth aboard Son of One. He now has 32 victories, seven 
fewer than leader Patrick Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux won twice, finishing in a dead heat with Dark Heat in the 
fourth on Dragonetta and the eighth on Cat's Air.

SOVIETS ENTER SECOND CHALLENGER FOR AMERICA'S CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second Soviet entry, the Leningrad Yacht Club, has increased the number of 
1992 America's Cup challengers to 21, from 15 countries, the America's Cup 
Organizing Commmittee announced Thursday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for posting $25,000 entry fees was May 26, but Leningrad -- 
designated as the Red Star Syndicate -- was granted a two-week extension 
because of difficulties in transferring money to the United States, the 
committee said. 
</P>
<P>
The other Soviet entry is from the Odessa Arcadia Yacht Racing Club. The Soviet 
Union has never participated in the America's Cup.

U.S., NEW ZEALAND SQUARE OFF AGAIN IN MATCH RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sailors from the United States and New Zealand will return their America's Cup 
rivalry to the water today when they start a three-day series of match races on 
San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Isler, who heads a prospective defense syndicate, will sail against David 
Barnes, who was skipper of the big New Zealand monohull that lost two lopsided 
races to Dennis Conner's catamaran in the controversial defense in September 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. victory was recently ruled legal, so San Diego has gone ahead with 
plans to stage a defense of the Cup in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Isler and Barnes will sail 68-foot, ultralight maxi sleds similar to the new 
America's Cup class boats to be used in '92. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very light displacement boats and they accelerate quickly," Barnes 
said. "They're very fast. They don't need a lot of breeze to keep going. In 
that respect, they're quite similar to the America's Cup class, but the new 
class is much more of a thoroughbred." 
</P>
<P>
Each boat will have a crew of 11, about seven short of the normal complement 
for a sled. Three races scheduled today will count one point each, three races 
Saturday two points each and two races Sunday three points each. The crews will 
switch boats so that each will race four times in each boat. 
</P>
<P>
Racing is scheduled to start at 12:30 p.m. each day, winds permitting. RICH 
ROBERTS

Trump Confident He'll Get Loans: Donald J. Trump's advisers are confident that 
the real estate magnate will write $36 million in checks today to pay the 
interest on his junk bond debt, but a pending bank loan deal to ease his cash 
crunch is still in doubt. Trump, who celebrated his 44th birthday Thursday, is 
seeking to arrange $60 million in financing to ease the cash shortage facing 
his massive but debt-laden real estate and casino empire. 
</P>
<P>
Trump advisers, appearing on the "Donahue" television talk show to defend their 
employer, said they were confident that Trump would make the payment. Bankers 
are worried that Trump may become hard-pressed to meet payments on his 
estimated $2 billion in bank loans if he goes ahead and makes the bond payment. 
As a result, they are seeking a deal before the bond payment is made.

Inventories Up Slightly: Business inventories inched upward 0.1% in April to a 
seasonally adjusted $794.46 billion, while sales fell 1.1% to a seasonally 
adjusted $533.04 billion, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said inventories are keeping in line with sales, and their slight 
increase in April "does not lead to any recessionary outlook." Retailers had 
the biggest increase in inventories, up 0.3%, followed by a 0.1% gain in the 
manufacturing sector. Wholesalers' inventories on the other hand, dropped 0.2%.

S&amp;P Downgrades Ford, Chrysler: Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Group 
downgraded its credit ranking for Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., signaling 
sagging faith in the auto industry's finances. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's Investor Services Inc. said it is considering whether to change 
Chrysler's rating. The ratings reflect how Wall Street views companies' credit 
worthiness. Lower ratings generally mean that firms must pay higher interest to 
borrow in the credit markets. S&amp;P dropped Ford one notch to AA-minus from 
AA, considered a high level of investment grade securities. Chrysler fell to

B of A Parent's Debt Rating Raised: Fitch Investors Service raised 
BankAmerica's senior debt rating to A-plus from A-minus, citing the San 
Francisco banking company's turnaround. The New York rating agency credited 
BankAmerica, parent of Bank of America, with putting more emphasis on West 
Coast regional banking, which has made it more profitable and lowered its 
proportion of risky assets. But Fitch added that BankAmerica's exposure to 
problem foreign loans remains a risk.

ABC WON'T USE CONTROVERSIAL AD RATE POLICY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE NETWORK HAS CHANGED TO THE MORE FLEXIBLE PLAN SET BY RIVAL NBC. 
ADVERTISERS HAD COMPLAINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to pressure from advertisers, Capital Cities/ABC Inc. abandoned its 
controversial plan to change the way it sets ad rates and instead has adopted a 
more flexible policy announced by NBC earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, ABC was the first network to disclose that it was departing from 
a decades-old industry standard and changing the way it guarantees an audience 
to advertisers because of what the networks contend is an inexplicable decline 
in viewers during the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
CBS also said late Thursday that it found the NBC plan "acceptable" and would 
adopt it as policy. 
</P>
<P>
Networks typically assure advertisers that programs will deliver a certain 
number of viewers within a specific category -- women between the ages of 18 to 
49, for example -- but if a show's ratings are below expectations, the network 
must give the sponsor free commercial time to make up the difference, known as 
"makegoods" in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But during the first quarter of this year, television ratings dropped off 
dramatically, which so far this year has cost the networks an estimated $150 
million to $200 million in bonus time given away to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
The networks claim that an undiscovered glitch in the 3-year-old A. C. Nielsen 
Co. "people meter" measurement system is at fault. 
</P>
<P>
But the ratings company, along with the advertising industry, maintain that 
there is nothing wrong with the system. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's decision to drop its policy in favor of NBC's was no surprise to ad 
agencies, which last week blasted the network's plan as too radical and 
unwieldy to implement. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus in the industry is that the NBC plan was better than ABC's," 
said Steven Sternberg, vice president at New York-based agency Bozell Inc. 
"Although we still don't necessarily agree there is anything wrong with 
Nielsen." 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg said the NBC plan was better because it relied on viewing levels 
going back eight years, compared to ABC's, which only used data going back to 
1987, as a basis to make audience projections for the coming season. 
</P>
<P>
The result was that NBC's policy acknowledged that viewing levels were likely 
to be lower while the ABC policy nearly erased any declines. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Segal, executive vice president at the McCann Erickson agency in New York, 
said the more moderate NBC approach might not turn out to be all that different 
from the traditional method of guaranteeing audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"Chances are there won't be a big variant in the numbers," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, ABC said it had backed off its original proposal -- which 
network officials had insisted was firm -- after it had reviewed rival NBC's 
own policy and taken into account the reaction from agencies and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
"A uniform policy is in the best interest of the entire advertising and 
television communities," ABC said. 
</P>
<P>
Added a spokeswoman for the network: "If NBC's approach had better recognition, 
fine. Let's get on with business. It is not a contest to see whose plan was 
better." 
</P>
<P>
All three networks are entering a crucial period when they begin selling 
advertising time for the coming fall season. 
</P>
<P>
Although the process is typically fraught with public posturing about the 
strength or weakness of the advertising marketplace, many network and agency 
executives nonetheless expect the networks to book $4.3 billion or more in 
advertising over the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, however, this so-called up-front selling season could be delayed 
and complicated by the squabble over the networks' new ad rate policies. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising agencies are threatening to shift portions of ad budgets away from 
the networks and into cable, syndication or Fox Broadcasting Co. 
</P>
<P>
The latter has promised not to abandon the traditional method of guaranteeing 
audiences.

RADIO RANCH WINS 3 CLIO AWARDS FOR ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may be one thing funnier than the name Dick Orkin's Radio Ranch: its 
radio spots. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, was the opinion Thursday night of those judging one of the most 
coveted awards in advertising -- the Clio Awards. The Los Angeles production 
company walked off with three Clios. That led all other West Coast competitors, 
although the New York office of the Venice agency Chiat/Day/Mojo also won 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Los Angeles firms won two Clios each for their radio spots -- Cashman 
&amp; Associates and Hill, Holliday, Wakeman, DeForrest. The campaign that won 
honors for Hill Holliday is for PacTel Cellular. In the ad, a fast-talking guy 
without a car phone wonders out loud why another guy with an MBA -- and a 
PacTel car phone -- gets more respect than he does. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most familiar radio spot that won for Dick Orkin's Radio Ranch is 
one that features a man who takes his grandmother to Disneyland. In the spot, 
the man keeps trying to persuade his gung-ho grandma that she is too old to hop 
on the park's Splash Mountain ride. 
</P>
<P>
Why does humor seem to always win the most Clios in the radio category? 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much else you can do if you're going to deal with peoples' 
emotions," said Orkin. "People respond to humor. It touches something very 
human in them." 
</P>
<P>
This marks the second consecutive year that Orkin's 20-year-old production 
company has won the most radio Clios in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Clients like it when you win awards," said the 54-year-old Orkin, "but if 
their sales don't improve, we know they won't come back to us." 
</P>
<P>
But plenty of clients are coming back. Recently, the production company 
expanded into consulting and radio production services. "We're just beginning 
to grow," said Orkin. 
</P>
<P>
The Clio Awards have grown too. But some advertising executives say the highly 
profitable competition has lost some stature in recent years since it has added 
so many new award categories. But Clio officials point out that the number of 
entries increases annually too. That includes a combined 25,000 entries 
submitted in the print, radio and package design categories. The Clios for the 
best TV ads of the year will be handed out Monday evening.

CURBING KIDS' PHONE TIRADES;

BEHAVIOR: THERE ARE SIMPLE STRATEGIES FOR PARENTS TO HAVE UNINTERRUPTED

Little Joey Jackson is the picture of sweetness in his blue sailor hat -- which 
he has, at age 3, developed a borderline obsession for wearing. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on the kitchen floor, little Joey is a cutie. A sweet boy. A honey, 
even. 
</P>
<P>
A honey, that is, until Mommy -- Debbie, to you -- gets a telephone call. And 
then, li'l Joey becomes a hellion, all arms and whines, grasping for attention, 
interrupting even the shortest conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"At first," said the boy's mother, "I thought I was raising a really mean 
little kid, a kid who demands much too much attention." 
</P>
<P>
But then she talked to her friends and found that something about a telephone's 
ringing triggers feelings deep in a child's psyche. Perhaps it is genetics. 
</P>
<P>
So the mother is on the telephone, and the child starts to talk to her. 
</P>
<P>
C'mon. Only moments before, the child was oblivious to his mother's presence. 
Nothing could have turned his attention to her. 
</P>
<P>
But get on the telephone -- or pick up a book, or try to take a warm bath or 
have a conversation with another adult in the grocery checkout line -- and a 
child suddenly is riveted to his mother's side. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very annoying, because 15 minutes on the telephone doesn't seem like a 
lot to ask, but to that child, it's like someone coming in and stealing their 
mother," said Jane Richards-Jones, program director for Creative Parenting, a 
4-year-old state-funded program that is part of the Parent Training Consortium 
of New Britain, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're not busy, you're right where the children need you," said Nancy 
Robinson, who cares for six children in her family day-care business in 
addition to raising her own two children. "It's almost like a craving someone 
has for chocolate. It could be around the house for months and then all of a 
sudden, because it's not there anymore, you want some." 
</P>
<P>
Even the best-mannered child may slip when Mom or Dad is otherwise occupied, 
Robinson said. But it's an important part of developing into well-adjusted 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like learning what you're going to have to deal with later in life," 
she said. "Not everybody can tend to you every second. They learn this at an 
extremely young age. They understand a lot more than some people give them 
credit for." 
</P>
<P>
The best time to deal with the interruption issue is before it happens, 
Richards-Jones said. When it occurs, most parents don't think rationally. They 
just want to gag the child. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, if I am going to be on the phone, I tell them beforehand: 'I 
am going to be on the phone. I have to make a phone call. Do not bother me,' " 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richards-Jones suggests holding a family meeting if children are school age, or 
explaining to the smaller children that Mommy or Daddy has to talk on the phone 
for a while, and soon she will be off to play with them. 
</P>
<P>
Or store quiet activities, such as games or coloring books near the telephone 
to distract the children.

SUCCESS OF COMIC HEROES ON THE BIG SCREEN DEPENDS ON CASTING, CONCEPTION, HUMOR

Into the glare of the police line-up strides Dick Tracy, fearless as ever. 
Ready to take it on the chin in the tradition of such comics heroes as 
Superman, Batman, Popeye, Conan, Prince Valiant, Li'l Abner, Flash Gordon, Buck 
Rogers, the Ninja Turtles and Howard the Duck, as one Who Dared Make the Leap. 
</P>
<P>
And we should not forget the heroines: Barbarella, Blondie, Modesty Blaise, 
Little Orphan Annie, Wonder Woman, Supergirl and Sheena; plus Brenda Starr, 
Reporter, who will reportedly make it out of video-rights hell and onto the 
screen at last this fall. 
</P>
<P>
You might make a modest bet on Tracy's chances. But just what makes some comic 
book characters click as they move from the flatness of the page to the 
seductiveness of flesh on film? What made Superman and Batman soar, while 
Howard the Duck waddled to a watery death? 
</P>
<P>
Studios would kill to know. You might think a man in a duck suit would have 
signaled disaster from the first floating feather; then again, four kids in 
turtle drag didn't sound very promising either. 
</P>
<P>
For filmmakers, a firestorm of anxiety begins with what style to use to move 
from the everything-is-possible world of the cartoonist to the sets-and-actors 
reality of a movie. Campy realism? ("Sheena"). Old-fashioned theatricality? 
("Annie"). Older-fashioned Saturday matinee heroics? ("Prince Valiant"). Or, as 
Warren Beatty has gambled, a highly stylized look that seems to engulf 
audiences for two hours without a murmur. 
</P>
<P>
Casting, conception, humor: for a comic strip movie to soar, it can't stint on 
humor. It must be there in the screenplay, in the playfully exaggerated look of 
the film, and it has to exist in the chemical makeup of the actors. When actors 
suggest a hint of wit, everything seems possible. Without that -- an element as 
crucial as oxygen to life -- it's simply biff, bam, zowie!, and we're hard put 
to give a damn. 
</P>
<P>
But even with those elements in place -- or NOT in place -- you cannot predict 
how well the trip from page to movie picture will work. Paramount's 1980 
"Popeye" had a script by Jules Feiffer, who knows comics as well as anyone, and 
at least one star -- Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl -- who seemed the physical 
incarnation of her comic strip character. But director Robert Altman couldn't 
hold it all together and the picture sank in a sea of muttered dialogue (from 
poor Robin Williams, spitting his lines through the pipe stuck in the corner of 
his mouth). 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, John Milius' "Conan the Barbarian" had the makings of a 
Steve Reeves howler. But the script, co-written by Milius and up-and-coming 
Oliver Stone, nicely brought to life the bloody, pagan never-never land, and 
Arnold Schwarzenegger easily filled the role of the muscular pulp hero. 
</P>
<P>
"Conan" was eight years ago, and the gap between the style of comics and movies 
is getting smaller every summer. Just like the best comics, the most popular 
movies of the last 15 years are studded with characters who are already larger 
than life: "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Rocky," "Jaws," "Star Wars." It's not 
hard to imagine an artist's hand drawing "Back to the Future"; it's no surprise 
that 'RoboCop" is already between the pages of a comic book. 
</P>
<P>
The first comics, which propelled the most outrageous fantasies straight into 
our receptive unconscious, brought with them enormous freedom. With these 
heroes we could soar above the city, become the master of 1,000 disguises, 
impenetrable by even our closest associates, and live in a simpler world in 
which outward appearance matched inner character. Evil villains looked evil or 
diabolically weird -- like Pruneface or the Joker, or Ming the Merciless -- not 
like corporate raiders in three-piece suits. 
</P>
<P>
For a while back then, the movies had to struggle to keep up. Even their 
techniques were no match for a bottle of ink and an unbridled imagination. 
Watching low-rent serials like "Buck Rogers" was almost an invitation to giggle 
over lumpy tights and space machines made from a colander and a wire coat 
hanger. 
</P>
<P>
But "Barbarella" and "Flash Gordon" and "Superman" changed all that, and not 
simply with dumb muscles. With precious few heroes left in real life, audiences 
could look upon this trio of do-gooders (or in Barbarella's case, 
feel-gooders), as surrogate heroes without too much mortification. These movies 
were smart, sexy and, blessedly, written with a sense of humor; sometimes even 
with a sense of the ridiculous. Spandex had smoothed out those lumpy tights and 
wiped the snicker off our rotten faces in the process. Casting, special effects 
and towering production design took care of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbarella" worked not only because of our hope that Jane Fonda would feel the 
need to get out of that constricting old space suit, again, but because of 
Fonda's whole wide-eyed take on the character. In the French comic strip, 
Barbarella was more of a dim pushover than Fonda's incarnation of her; Fonda's 
space kitten some how managed to be party to the most impolite -- and repeated 
-- assaults on her person without losing her playfulness or her naivete. Or, 
her upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Flash Gordon" proved the absolute necessity of stocking a picture with serene 
old pros in the supporting roles. It gave the audience somewhere else to look 
when the principals are on screen and out to lunch, simultaneously. The 
peroxided Flash (Sam J. Jones) and his Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) were, to 
put it kindly, dim bulbs, but while Ornella Muti's savage sister to the Emperor 
Ming was on-screen, audiences tended to feel more forgiving. And while -- by 
"Star Wars" standards -- the special effects weren't breathtaking, the script 
was nicely ironic and the sound and fury of Brian Blessed's hawk-like Prince 
Vultan and Max von Sydow's quintessentially villainous Ming were just what were 
needed to keep the exaggerated comics quality alive on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
But "Superman" was the watershed film: Richard Donner's visionary production 
not only had the scope and the magnificence that the Siegel and Shuster strip 
could only hint at, but none of the fun was lost in the spectacle. And the 
flying duets between a perfectly-realized Superman and Lois Lane carried a 
fantastic erotic jolt. We'd watched heroes fly, from Tarzan with his jungle 
vines on up, but before this, no movie had let us fly too, with all the 
sexuality that soaring in tandem implied. From its screenplay to its 
cinematography "Superman" was that meld of the sophisticated and the simple 
that had been missing from comics-movies until now. 
</P>
<P>
Visually, the comics and the movies had fed off each other for decades. As 
Jules Feiffer tells it in "The Great Comic Book Heroes," "Citizen Kane" got 
extra-scrupulous study from cartoonists in the early 1940s after the rumor 
circulated that Orson Welles read and learned from comic books. 
</P>
<P>
Welles' camera angles, and when and how he used them, became part of the 
cartoonists' vocabulary, which had already absorbed the futuristic fantasies of 
German Expressionism. The looming factory gears and super-modernistic city of 
"Metropolis," the tortured perspectives of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" had 
not gone unnoticed by the artists who created "Batman" or "The Spirit." In the 
comic book heyday of the '30s and '40s, every visual style was fair game for 
the pulp mill and a "swipe" was the highest form of flattery. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Burton's "Batman," with its lowering vision of Gotham City gone rotten, put 
the comics' style of Expressionism back on the screen again, as it let the dark 
side of the comics have their day. Not sinister enough for fans of Frank 
Miller's "The Dark Knight," an inky '80s re-telling of the Batman story, but 
quite dark enough for some. What worked best was the film's mood and its 
extraordinary design; but there was a punishing quality to Jack Nicholson's 
Joker that gave "Batman" a comic strip intensity of a difficult kind. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, "Dick Tracy" seems to have been built around actors with nicely 
ironic sensibilities: Al Pacino, delivering his lines in machine-gun bursts of 
energy, might be sending-up his own roles in "The Godfathers" or in "Scarface." 
Dustin Hoffman, already drollest of the droll, is Mumbles, a character whose 
mumble is as famous as Hoffman's own. Glenne Headley, keeps Tess Trueheart from 
fading into Good Girl limbo by sheer exercise of deadpan wit. Seymour Cassel 
can't be unaware of his hilarious resemblance to Sam Catchem. Then of course 
there is Warren Beatty's Tracy, whose probity in the face of Madonna's torchy 
come-on has to be the deepest irony of all. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously Dick Tracy is intrinsically different from Batman or Superman. 
Although Beatty has worked to make the rugged Tracy dynamic and even -- in the 
scenes with Charlie Korsmo's extraordinary Kid -- compassionate, in his own, 
choked, manly way, his hero is a dogged gumshoe, not a caped avenger. It 
remains to be seen if the deliciousness of the production and Tracy's rogue's 
gallery of grand and goofy characters will carry such heresy. 
</P>
<P>
Wit, elegant production design, a deft screenplay, a well-stocked larder of 
actors who are in on the joke of the film and a legendary hero/heroine. That's 
what has made the barn burners of the past and it's a pretty good thumbnail 
sketch of "Dick Tracy." And after being caught in the cross-fire of the 
bloodiest opening season yet, some families may even find "Dick Tracy's" 
relatively stylized gunplay and Tracy's own foursquare morality a beacon in 
this summer of total recoil. Time will very shortly tell.

CHOREOGRAPHER REJECTS NEA'S $72,000 GRANT; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: BELLA LEWITZKY SAYS SHE WILL ALSO FILE SUIT AGAINST THE AGENCY, SEEKING A 
COURT DECISION AGAINST THE NO-OBSCENITY PLEDGE.

<P>
Acclaimed choreographer Bella Lewitzky said Thursday she will reject $72,000 in 
National Endowment for the Arts funding and file suit against the federal 
agency, hoping a court will invalidate a requirement that NEA grantees sign a 
pledge not to create obscene work. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Lewitzky at a Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel press conference 
attended by Mayor Tom Bradley was the latest development in a broad protest 
within the arts community over attempts by conservatives in Congress to rein in 
the NEA. The grant rejection represents the largest amount of NEA support 
turned back so far in a protest in which at least five other artists or arts 
organizations have rejected grants or filed suit over NEA restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky and Michael Hudson, vice president and general counsel for the liberal 
organization People for the American Way, said the 74-year-old dance legend 
would file a federal court suit in either Los Angeles or Washington within the 
next two weeks. Hudson said the action will seek an injunction against the 
endowment's enforcement of a current provision that prohibits funding of work 
that is obscene. The NEA's own general counsel has suggested the language is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided that I could not, in good moral conscience, accept the fact that a 
trampling on the rights of the First Amendment was good or even legal," 
Lewitzky said in her remarks at the press conference. The meeting with 
reporters, which was also attended by the 12 dancers in Lewitzky's company and 
about 50 arts community supporters, was held at the same hotel where Lewitzky 
refused to answer questions of the House Un-American Activities Committee at 
the height of the McCarthy scare in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Joe McCarthy, after damaging endless lives, was . . . declared a madman," 
Lewitzky said. "I am witness to (Sen.) Jesse Helms' (R-N.C.) destructive 
attacks on the NEA. All (these) incidents take down artists and art. How many 
times must history repeat itself? We must act. Having been witness, I must 
act." 
</P>
<P>
Hudson said the court suit would also ask a judge to declare the controversial 
NEA provision unconstitutional. He acknowledged that the Lewitzky court action 
would be similar to a suit already on file in federal court in New York in 
which the New School for Social Research is asking a judge for essentially the 
same ruling. A hearing on a New School request for an injunction is tentatively 
set for July 31. 
</P>
<P>
But Hudson and Lewitzky said the legal action by the Los Angeles-based Lewitzky 
Dance Company would make legal arguments slightly different from the New York 
action and attempt to broaden federal court review of the controversial 
statute. The litigation and Lewitzky's decision to reject the $72,000 grant 
come as the NEA faces increasing difficulty in its attempts to fend off even 
greater regulation of artistic subject matter as Congress works on legislation 
to renew the arts endowment for another five years. 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky said it was not certain how her company would make up for the 
financial shortfall. The NEA grant in question, from the endowment's dance 
program, represents about 8.5% of Lewitzky's 1990 operating budget of about 
$850,000. She said private donations would be sought, but said no substitute 
money had yet been received -- although at least one arts supporter in the 
press conference audience publicly offered to make a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley called the crisis over the continued artistic freedom of the arts 
endowment "one of the most critical issues facing freedom-loving people in this 
country." "All of us need to say the same thing. We cannot and will not accept 
this intrusion on the rights of freedom of expression in this country," Bradley 
said. "If we permit this kind of thing to happen, political decisions will 
determine which artists receive support. We're here to say we cannot permit 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The arts endowment declined to comment on the Lewitzky announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Adolfo V. Nodal, the city's director of cultural affairs, said his agency last 
week rejected a proposal by the NEA's visual arts program to participate in a 
national homeless artists program. Nodal said the NEA plan was turned aside 
because the city agency -- at Bradley's urging -- has adopted a policy of 
refusing to accept restrictions on the content of municipally financed art. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way the city is going to accept money that will require us to 
throw an obscenity clause on our artists," Nodal said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky said she was sensitive to potential criticism that her decision might 
play into the hands of Helms and other conservatives, who have argued that 
valid art forms can survive in the private financial sector without government 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"It's standing on my personal convictions," Lewitzky said. "I don't feel that 
notes of protest are going to affect Jesse Helms at all." 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky said her company originally struck out anti-obscenity wording in its 
NEA grant letter and returned the edited version to the endowment, but NEA 
officials notified the company no money would be distributed unless Lewitzky 
signed an acknowledgement of the obscenity clause. 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky's action followed decisions by New York theater producer Joseph Papp, 
the University of Iowa Press, Los Angeles choreographer Ferne Ackerman and a 
Seattle arts group to reject NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of national arts organizations, who said Lewitzky's decision may have 
mixed effects in the endowment crisis, supported the stand taken by the famed 
choreographer, who has been an NEA grant recipient since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to do what you have to do," said Anne Murphy, executive director of 
the Washington-based American Arts Alliance. "She lived through other eras in 
this country where people questioned loyalty and freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Brooks, director of Washington-based Dance USA, said, "I think that this 
is such a delicate situation right now with the arts endowment that each artist 
and administrator involved needs to address the question from their hearts."

HOOVER SPRINTER DIES FROM INJURIES SUSTAINED IN CRASH

Felix Shen, a sprinter on the Hoover High track team, died late last Friday 
night when a car in which he was a passenger slammed into a Rapid Transit 
District bus on Canada Boulevard in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Shen, 17, died from multiple traumatic injuries, according to Bob Dambacher of 
the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters needed the Jaws of Life to extract Shen's body from the back seat 
of the 1981 Ford Escort. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle, driven by teammate Ben Marckmann, 17, was estimated to be 
traveling at 65 m.p.h., according to a report filed with the Glendale Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The car, heading south on Canada, lost traction when Marckmann failed to 
negotiate a turn near Willow Drive, the report said, and the vehicle crossed 
the double-yellow line before skidding into a northbound RTD bus. 
</P>
<P>
Both Marckmann and teammate Marcus Carr were thrown from the vehicle. Marckmann 
suffered a broken sternum and Carr sustained a shattered right arm. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office in Pasadena will seek a manslaughter charge 
against Marckmann, according to Glendale police. 
</P>
<P>
Shen had posted bests of 11.9 seconds for 100 meters and 19 feet 4 inches in 
the long jump.

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 17 fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's 
spill response log for March.

Detroit Pistons fans celebrating the team's second consecutive NBA championship 
turned violent early today. At least seven people died and several more were 
critically injured as thousands packed downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
Police in suburban River Rouge arrested 28 revelers, most on disorderly conduct 
charges, and there were numerous reports of looting and related violence. 
Detroit police had no overall count of arrests or violent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In the crush, a car plowed into pedestrians on the city's East Side about 1:15 
a.m., killing four people and injuring one, Detroit Police Lt. Phil Foster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 9-year-old boy was pronounced dead at Children's Hospital, a 10-year-old boy 
and a 15-year-old girl died at St. John's Hospital, and a 21-year-old man died 
late this morning at Detroit Receiving Hospital, Police Sgt. Christopher Buck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Buck said the driver of the car remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old man was shot to death and a 25-year-old man critically injured at 
a parking lot at 2:15 a.m., Foster said. He said the lot was packed with 
revelers and someone shot into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The streets -- some strewn with glass -- were quiet by dawn, and police who 
stayed through the night on overtime headed home. 
</P>
<P>
A 4-year-old suburban Detroit child was struck and killed by a car during a 
street celebration in River Rouge, said Lt. David Israel of that suburb's 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The child was excited and ran into the street," Israel said. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-year-old man fell from the roof of an apartment building during a 
celebration party and died later at Detroit Receiving Hospital, hospital 
spokeswoman Diane Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Egan, a Mount Carmel Hospital nurse, said fights even broke out in the 
hospital's emergency room early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We were running around like crazy. We registered something like 20 gunshot 
wounds between midnight and 4 a.m.," Egan said. "It was ridiculous. In my three 
years here, I've never seen anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
Several revelers told television crews that they were robbed as they stood on 
the streets and others said people reached into their cars, stealing stereo 
speakers and wallets, as they tried to drive through the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic in downtown Detroit ground to a halt as merrymakers weaved between the 
cars, hugging and chanting "Bad boys!" in the hours after Vinnie Johnson's shot 
with seven-tenths of a second left gave the Pistons a 92-90 win over the Trail 
Blazers in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, hundreds of carloads of boisterous fans also jammed streets after 
the Pistons' 105-97 win over the Los Angeles Lakers for a 4-0 sweep of the 
National Basketball Assn. finals and their first championship. But that 
celebration was devoid of the damage and deaths that occurred today.

AISSA WAYNE'S ATTACKER GETS 8-YEAR TERM 
</P>

<P>
Jerrel Lee Hintergardt, who stunned even his own lawyer by admitting his 
involvement in the 1988 assault on John Wayne's daughter and her boyfriend at 
the time, was sentenced today to eight years in state prison, the maximum 
possible term. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt's attorney told jurors last month that his client was at a Los 
Angeles hospital for an adjustment on his artificial foot when Aissa Wayne and 
financier Roger W. Luby were attacked the morning of Oct. 3, 1988, in the 
garage of Luby's Newport Beach estate. But moments before he was scheduled to 
testify, Hintergardt, 38, told his attorney, Todd A. Landgren, that he had been 
lying to him; he was at the Luby estate that day. 
</P>
<P>
At today's sentencing, Luby made a victim impact statement to the court, but 
turned his comments directly to Hintergardt: "I was seriously injured; you will 
never know how much you have injured me." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Wayne's ex-husband, Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, had ordered 
the attack during a bitter custody dispute over their 2-year-old daughter. 
Gionis, whose trial in the assault is scheduled for Aug. 28, is accused of 
hiring Los Angeles private investigator O. Daniel Gal, who in turn allegedly 
hired Hintergardt and another man, Jeffrey K. Bouey, to carry out the doctor's 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and Luby had just returned from a health club workout when two gunmen 
approached them as they got out of their car in Luby's garage. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and Luby both testified that it was Hintergardt who beat up Luby and 
slashed his Achilles' tendon with a knife, then smashed Wayne's face several 
times into the concrete garage floor. Hintergardt admitted the Luby assault but 
blamed Wayne's injuries on Bouey. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans asked Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan 
for the maximum sentence, telling the court that the "purely gratuitous" 
cutting on Luby's heel was a vicious act that deserved the stiffest punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Landgren had asked the judge to sentence Hintergardt to the 
mid-term of six years, based on Hintergardt's lack of prior criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
Landgren said later, however, Ryan's decision was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"With the extent of the injuries to Mr. Luby, it's certainly understandable how 
a judge could see this as an aggravated case," Landgren said.

A private school building collapsed today in the eastern oil city of Port 
Harcourt, killing at least 23 students and injuring 60, witnesses and hospital 
workers said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 policemen were digging through the collapsed structure for 15 
other students feared trapped in the rubble, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred as about 200 students gathered for a debate in a room on 
the third floor of the building, which was still under construction, said one 
survivor, 19-year-old Elizabeth Ikaedim. 
</P>
<P>
She said many of the students were trapped on a staircase when they tried to 
flee as the walls began caving in. 
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said the owner of the building has been arrested. A police 
source said the building owner did not have a permit for the construction.

POLICE TELL WHY THEY SUSPECT TEEN BROTHER SHOT HIS SISTER

A 12-year-old Anaheim Shores girl who was allegedly shot in the head Thursday 
by her 14-year-old brother remained in critical condition today as police 
revealed details claiming that the boy concocted a story about the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said 18 police officers searched the neighborhood for about 
an hour Thursday afternoon when the boy telephoned police to report that "three 
masked men" had broken into their home and shot his sister, Gema Marie Hubler, 
in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Police finally arrested the boy when evidence led them to believe that he had 
concocted the story and that he was responsible for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
During the search, Hedgpeth said a police helicopter circled above the 
neighborhood looking for a getaway car and police dogs attempted to track the 
alleged assailants, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
One man was briefly detained during the search after a neighbor reported that 
she saw a "man acting strangely." 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we felt uncomfortable with his story, we knew that if the 
'suspects' got away because we ignored him, we would have felt bad," Hedgpeth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour, Hedgpeth said investigators suspected that the boy's story was 
concocted. Hedgpeth said the physical evidence police found on the scene did 
not match the boy's story. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Gema Hubler was in critical condition today at UCI Medical Center in Orange 
where she underwent surgery for a single gunshot wound in the head, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler's brother is being held in Orange County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of 
attempted murder. His name was not released because he is a juvenile.

Miners from across the Soviet Union today passed a vote of no confidence in the 
Communist Party and called for the party to relinquish its assets. They also 
agreed to form an independent union. 
</P>
<P>
"We are workers, but we do not consider the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
our party," said the resolution. "We call for a mass exit from the party." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution demanded that the party relinquish its control over large state 
enterprises and give up holdings including property and bank accounts filled 
with members' dues. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved by a vote of 308 to 116, said Communists could no 
longer present themselves as champions of workers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party is losing its authority," said a resolution passed by the 
first congress of Soviet miners meeting in the Don Basin coal mining region of 
the eastern Ukraine.

Black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela, in an audience with Pope John Paul 
II today, called on the Vatican to take a clear position supporting sanctions 
against South Africa in order to persuade Pretoria to dismantle apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope received the African National Congress deputy president in a cordial 
private audience, but a spokesman said the pontiff was not taking a specific 
stand on sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
A Vatican statement issued afterward said the Holy See supported "peaceful 
political evolution" in South Africa "with the progressive overcoming of the 
system of apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said this would lead to a society "based on pacification and 
reconciliation among all . . . with the guarantee of respect for the 
fundamental rights of each of its citizens."

10 DEAD, DOZENS MISSING IN OHIO FLASH FLOODS

A flash flood sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high rampaging through hill 
communities along the Ohio River, killing at least 10 people and leaving dozens 
missing, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4,300 residents overflowed 
when thunderstorms dumped about 4 inches of rain Thursday night in about an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It created a wall of water," said Jim Williams of the Ohio Emergency 
Management Agency. "The problem we're having right now is accounting for the 
people we can't find." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said 40 to 60 people were unaccounted for at midday. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont County's sheriff's Sgt. Bart Giesey said 10 people were confirmed dead. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Richard F. Celeste declared a state of emergency and surveyed the area. 
</P>
<P>
The raging waters knocked homes off their foundations and washed away a bar 
filled with people in Shadyside, an Appalachian foothill town. 
</P>
<P>
The Shadyside Fire Department set up a command center at the Jefferson 
Elementary School to coordinate rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Command center spokeswoman Karen Bovek said officials had no complete death 
toll figure. Authorities were searching for victims in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking miles and miles of country roads that haven't been gotten to 
yet," she said. "It's a disaster here." 
</P>
<P>
Shadyside -- about 10 miles south of Wheeling, W.Va. -- is in Belmont County, a 
mostly hilly, rural area in eastern Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Mayor James Amato said the storms created a deluge that knocked homes 
off their foundations. "There are a lot of trailers out in this area that got 
hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Judy Phillips said a Shadyside 
bar full of people was washed away when water caved in the back wall. Two 
people were accounted for, she said. But she could offer no estimate of how 
many were in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in 
Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to describe it . . . you've got to see it to believe it," 
Badia said. 
</P>
<P>
There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont, and Licking 
County in central Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 residents were evacuated from their homes in central Ohio after 3 
inches of rain fell in an hour, flooding streets and washing out rural roads.

<P>
Industrial production rebounded 0.6% in May from a flat performance a month 
earlier because of accelerated automobile production, the Federal Reserve said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"A rebound from last month's sharp decline in motor vehicle production 
accounted for much of the May increase in industrial production," the central 
bank's report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial production increased 0.2% in 
May and 0.4% in April." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed also reported the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and 
utilities -- which usually move in tandem with industrial production -- rose 
0.3 of a percentage point to 83.6% in May. The operating rate measures not only 
output but also changes in productivity levels. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial production has risen each month since January except for April when 
it was unchanged. The flat April figure was revised from a 0.4% decline first 
reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
Output was up 0.9% in February and 0.5% in March. It dropped 1% during the 
first month of 1990.

DEFICIT SHRINKS 17% TO $6.94 BILLION

<P>
The U.S. trade deficit shrank dramatically to $6.94 billion in April, the 
second lowest level in the last six years, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the 17% improvement from a March deficit of $8.36 
billion came entirely from a big drop in imports, which offset a smaller 
decline in U.S. export sales. 
</P>
<P>
Imports totaled $39.25 billion in April, 6.2% lower than March, with the 
decline attributed primarily to lower demand for foreign oil and a big drop in 
auto imports. 
</P>
<P>
Exports fell by 3.5% to $32.3 billion. But this was considered only a small 
drop off an all-time high of $33.5 billion set in March. 
</P>
<P>
America's trade performance has been a pleasant surprise so far this year, with 
the deficit showing a much larger improvement than many analysts thought 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first four months, the deficit has been running at an annual rate 
of $92.16 billion, compared to a deficit for all of 1989 of $108.99 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts are now forecasting that the 1990 deficit will drop below $100 
billion for the first time since 1983 as export growth remains strong enough to 
offset a growing dependence on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
That would spell good news for the Bush Administration, which is counting on a 
strong trade performance to keep the economy out of a recession. Over the last 
three years, fully one-third of overall U.S. economic growth has been supplied 
by surging export sales. 
</P>
<P>
The April deficit of $6.94 billion was the smallest since a February imbalance 
of $6.10 billion with both months turning in the best trade performance since a 
$5.7-billion imbalance in December, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
For April, both oil imports and auto imports were down by about $1 billion 
each. 
</P>
<P>
The 20% drop in oil imports to a total of $3.75 billion reflected a drop in the 
volume of shipments and price.

CONSUMER INFLATION HELD TO MODEST 0.2%;

<P>
Falling vegetable and fuel oil prices in May held consumer inflation to a 
modest 0.2% for the second consecutive month, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of the year, the Labor Department's consumer price 
index has advanced at an annual rate of 5.8%. That's up significantly from the 
4.6% rate for all of last year, but down sharply from the worrisome 8.5% rate 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The good news was expected by most economists, who said prices are recovering 
from a cold weather jolt at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as first-quarter inflation was overstated, inflation (in April and May) 
was understated," said economist Michael K. Evans, a Washington-based 
consultant. "We're almost sure price increases are going to get bigger again 
next month." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that "despite the temporary 
increase in the first quarter, over the last 12 months consumer prices have 
increased 4.4%. Inflation remains low and under control." 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said prices of fruit and vegetables fell 2.4%, the third 
substantial drop in a row. Vegetables soared 29.2% in the first two months of 
the year before falling 23.6% in the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
Food overall in May rose just 0.1% after edging down 0.2% in April. 
</P>
<P>
Dairy product costs fell for the third consecutive month in May while prices 
were up for sweets, fats and oils and beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices fell 0.7%, the fourth monthly decline after a large increase in 
January. Fuel oil fell 1.4% and natural gas 2.7%. However, electricity charges 
rose 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices rose modestly, but less than usual for the start of the warm 
weather driving season. Thus, after seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices were 
reported down 1.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the often volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a moderate 
0.3% after a 0.2% rise in April. Economists consider this so-called core rate a 
better indication of underlying inflation because it moves less erratically. 
</P>
<P>
New car prices edged down 0.2%, the fourth consecutive decline in the face of 
sluggish sales. 
</P>
<P>
Apparel prices, which had been up sharply earlier in the year because a warm 
February got spring sales off to an early start, fell 0.3% last month. The 
price of men's clothing rose 0.4%, but women's and children's clothing fell 1% 
and 2.2% respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The price of medical care jumped 0.8% in May for the fourth consecutive month, 
pushing those costs 9% higher than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes put the index for all consumer prices at 129.2 in May. That 
means a hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the 
1982-84 base period cost $129.20 last month, up from $123.80 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices, which rose 0.3% in May, have behaved more moderately than 
consumer prices. The Labor Department's producer price index is up at only a 4% 
annual rate so far this year, down from 4.8% for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Economists point to the different composition of the two indexes as an 
explanation for their divergence.

The manufacturer of Mazola Corn Oil is dropping claims implying that the 
product reduces cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
CPC International Inc., based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said it has signed 
agreements with the Federal Trade Commission and the attorneys general of 10 
states, including California. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, CPC said its future advertisements will avoid the "use of 
statements which might be misinterpreted to mean that the use of corn oil 
would, by itself, lower serum cholesterol." 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts Atty. Gen. James Shannon said he and his colleagues challenged 
ads that made claims such as, "Mazola does what? They said it could turn back 
my cholesterol. I didn't believe it until my level dropped 17%." 
</P>
<P>
CPC did not admit any violations of law, and said it was trying to avoid 
expensive legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the company to pay $100,000 to cover the costs of the 
investigation, Shannon's office said.

A 1964 acoustic guitar from the collection of English classical guitarist 
Julian Bream has been sold for $26,100, a world auction record for the 
instrument, Sotheby's said. 
</P>
<P>
The guitar, made by Robert Bouchet in Paris, was bought Thursday by a Japanese 
dealer whose name was not available. The previous record was $18,900 paid in 
1974 for a south German guitar made in 1624. Bream has said he plays his 
guitars for two years and then likes to sell them for others to play. 
</P>
<P>
Electric guitars, when associated with rock stars, sell for far more money. One 
owned by the late Jimi Hendrix sold in April for $322,000.

RAPPERS PUT ON A CLEAN SHOW; TEENS VOID IT

A show by the rap group 2 Live Crew wasn't as nasty -- or as long -- as the 
audience wanted. But the group's leader said it proved that 2 Live Crew could 
put on a clean show for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"They said 2 Live Crew can't do a clean show and still rock. What we're going 
to do is we're going to prove them all wrong," band member Luther Campbell said 
during Thursday night's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider it the PG version," said Gwinnett County Police Chief Wayne Bolden 
as the group finished its last song. "This is the first rap concert I've been 
to and I'm kind of enjoying it. I like the beat." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and another member of the Miami-based rap group were arrested in 
Florida last weekend after they played songs from their sexually explicit "As 
Nasty As They Wanna Be" album at an all-adult show. A Florida record store 
owner who sold the album also was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests followed a federal judge's ruling that the album violates Florida's 
obscenity law. The ruling is being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy prompted the band to cancel one of two concerts planned at a 
club for teens Thursday night. Tickets sold for both shows were honored and the 
band played to an estimated 320 people -- roughly half the Ozone Club's 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
In a brisk 35 minutes, the band performed versions of some of the songs from 
"As Clean As They Wanna Be," which lacks the profanities. Each time group 
members stopped short of singing vulgar lyrics, teen-agers in the audience 
gleefully shouted them out. 
</P>
<P>
During the show, Campbell held up signs that read "no censorship" and led the 
crowd in chants of "no censorship" and "freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the group waited to leave Miami until they had talked to 
representatives of the Gwinnett County Police Department to make sure they 
would be allowed to perform a clean show without hassle. They left when they 
got it.

'TRACY' VIEWERS ISSUE GLOWING REVIEWS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Film analysts won't know until Monday whether grosses from Warren Beatty's 
"Dick Tracy" indicate a hit or a miss, but there was no question among the mob 
that filed out of one of the dozens of special midnight screenings across the 
Southland on Thursday. It's a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fabulous!" said an excited Sally Bental, 49, as she and her 13-year-old 
son, Dotan, came out of a screening at the Sherman Oaks General Cinema. Bental 
and her son, of Tarzana, had waited in line since 9 p.m. with the Dick Tracy 
T-shirts they had bought as admission tickets. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Dick Tracy' took place in a comic book world. You don't normally see a film 
in such striking primary colors," said Bental, who admits to being an avid fan 
of the Dick Tracy strip. Regarding Beatty as the Yellow Knight, she said, "Who 
says you can't be over 50 and still fight crime?" 
</P>
<P>
None of the patrons questioned on the way out of the theater in the early 
morning hour complained about paying the $12 admission, which included the 
movie and a T-shirt reading "I Was There First." 
</P>
<P>
"The shirts are a nice touch and $12 is a good buy," said Sandra Sparr, 29, of 
Sepulveda. "Heck, a T-shirt alone can cost you $12." She looked at the others 
in line. "And besides, it gives the whole thing a neat atmosphere because we're 
all wearing the same shirt." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Flynn, 24, of Encino liked the T-shirts and felt the film paid off, 
too. "It was like art on the screen. It was beyond my expectations: it looked 
great and had a great ending which took everyone off guard. I think Beatty 
succeeded in spades." 
</P>
<P>
Kris Strobeck, 24, of Studio City smiled when asked about the film. "I'm 
responding to the hype," she said. "It looks really well-crafted, a creative 
film on all levels. It's fun to do this in the middle of the night. It makes it 
an event." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, earlier Thursday night in Orlando, Beatty and co-star Dustin Hoffman 
appeared before a boisterous crowd of about 3,000 people who came to see the 
world premiere at a theater near the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna, who portrays the temptress-songstress Breathless Mahoney, canceled her 
appearance, citing a viral throat infection. The singer also canceled her 
"Blond Ambition" tour performances tonight and Saturday at The Spectrum in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Al Pacino, who plays villain Big Boy Caprice, also canceled because he is 
working on another movie, said Charles Ridgeway, a Disney spokesman said.

Rock legend Bo Diddley said his counterpart in two television commercials, 
sports star Bo Jackson, really doesn't know diddly about playing the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like you see in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
The guitar player who was with us was almost like a stunt man," Diddley said. 
"It just looks like he's playing that guitar, just like it looks like I'm 
shooting pool. They had me shooting pool, but I can't shoot pool." 
</P>
<P>
The first Nike ad, initially aired during the 1989 baseball All-Star Game, 
showed Jackson playing several sports and a superstar in each sport saying 
things such as, "Bo knows basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Then, on a stage with Diddley and his famous box-shaped guitar, Jackson tried 
to play a guitar, but Diddley told him, "Bo, you don't know diddly." 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Nike came back with a second ad with shots of Jackson and 
Diddley in a variety of leisure pursuits. It ends with Jackson supposedly 
playing guitar and Diddley saying the athlete does know diddly after all. 
</P>
<P>
Diddley said the second ad gives the impression that time has passed since the 
first ad, but both were shot at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all just show business," he told the Birmingham Post-Herald.

A drug-control review board has upheld a three-month suspension of long-jumper 
Larry Myricks, The Athletics Congress said today. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks was suspended in April after testing positive for phenylpropanolamine, 
a stimulant banned under International Amateur Athletic Federation rules. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks said the stimulant was in a common cold medication he took a day before 
the U.S. Track and Field Championships. Testimony at an initial hearing, 
however, indicated it was unlikely a normal dose of the medicine would have 
resulted in as high a level of phenylpropanolamine as Myricks' sample showed. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks, 34, of Upland, will be eligible to compete after July 13, TAC said.

Carl Lewis says he has been offered $6 million to race Ben Johnson, according 
to a report aired on Canadian television's CTV News. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and Johnson last met in the 100 meters in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, 
South Korea, where Johnson appeared to have captured the gold medal in a record 
time of 9.79 seconds and Lewis finished second in 9.92. 
</P>
<P>
However, Johnson was later stripped of his gold medal and world record for 
steroid use and Lewis was declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has been suspended from competition by Canadian and international track 
officials. His two-year suspension by the International Amateur Athletics 
Federation expires in late September. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Lewis have reportedly received numerous lucrative offers to run a 
race.

TYSON FIGHT TO BE TEST OF HIS PSYCHE, NOT HIS PUNCH

<P>
Mike Tyson's first fight Saturday since his astonishing knockout four months 
ago probably will be more of a test of his psyche than his left hook. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson is a 25-1 bet to waltz through Henry Tillman for his 38th victory in 
their scheduled 10-round fight at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the same was said about Tyson against James (Buster) Douglas before 
his stunning 10th-round knockout of the former champion in Tokyo last February. 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas at least had the tools to defeat Tyson, although the new 
heavyweight champion appeared to do his best before that fight to hide them 
under excess fat and a suspect heart. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman, on the other hand, has little to recommend him as anything more than a 
confidence-builder for Tyson. The joke about Tillman is that he has the chin of 
a cruiserweight and the punch of a welterweight. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman, 20-4, actually dropped out of boxing from March, 1988, to December, 
1989, after being knocked out by Canadian Willie DeWitt, and he had not done a 
whole lot to impress before then. 
</P>
<P>
The real issue is the effect the devastating Tokyo take-out has had on the 
23-year-old Tyson's mind. 
</P>
<P>
That question may be answered in part Saturday when fans will see if Tyson has 
shed the kamikaze two-step approach he used that made him an easy target for 
Douglas' jarring jabs and left him groping on all fours for his mouthpiece in 
his last act as undefeated champion. 
</P>
<P>
Does Tyson, who will be paid $5 million for the fight, still have the fire? How 
much has the loss affected his confidence, his heart? Has he stopped "abusing" 
his body, as he admitted he had done before the Douglas debacle? 
</P>
<P>
What effect has promoter Don King and his hand-picked Tyson-keepers had on 
Tyson? What effect will mercurial Richie Giachetti -- once former champion 
Larry Holmes's trainer -- have now that he is in Tyson's corner, which was so 
inept in Tokyo? 
</P>
<P>
George Foreman -- 41 or 42 depending on the source -- also is on Saturday's 
card as he continues his tilt at the boxing windmill in a bid for the title he 
once held in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman will fight Brazilian Adilson Rodrigues, 36-3, in another scheduled 
10-rounder, probably Foreman's toughest test in his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman, 66-2 overall and 21-0 since his comeback, knows a thing or two about 
boxing and about being knocked out. Muhammad Ali knocked out Foreman in 1974 to 
win the title.

<P>
A field of four headed by Bayakoa, the Eclipse Award winner as the outstanding 
older filly or mare in the country last year, has been entered in Saturday's 
$150,000-added Milady Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa will be ridden by Laffit Pincay and was assigned high weight of 127 
pounds for the 39th running of the 1 1/16 mile race for fillies and mares, 
3-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
Others entered were Fantastic Look, who will be ridden by Kent Desormeaux and 
was assigned 113 pounds; Felidia, Martin Pedroza, 112 pounds, and Kelly, Corey 
Nakatani, 110 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
If all four entries go to the post, the total purse will be $157,200 and the 
winner will earn $89,700. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa, a 6-year-old daughter of Consultant's Bid, will be trying to win the 
Milady Handicap for the second straight year. If she does, she'll surpass the 
$2-million mark in career earnings.

SOCCER OFFICIAL'S CRITICISM OF PENALTY MOLLIFIES U.S. PLAYER

U.S. midfielder Eric Wynalda of Westlake Village said today that he felt 
vindicated by remarks made this week by the International Federation of Assn. 
Football's general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing the performances of World Cup referees, Josef Blatter told the 
Associated Press that Wynalda should not have received a red card for a foul in 
the United States' opening game here last Sunday against Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The expulsion not only forced the United States to play the final 38 minutes of 
that 5-1 loss with only 10 men, but Wynalda also was disqualified from playing 
in Thursday night's 1-0 loss in Rome to Italy. Wynalda also was fined $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Blatter said Swiss referee Kurt Roethlisberger was "clearly too harsh" when he 
sent off Wynalda for shoving a Czech player in the back. Wynalda said it was 
retaliation for earlier incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"A yellow card would have been sufficient," Blatter said. 
</P>
<P>
"That statement doesn't make what I did all right," Wynalda said. "It was a 
learning experience for me. But FIFA's position does make me feel a lot 
better." RANDY HARVEY

The wives and girlfriends of Sweden's World Cup soccer players are flying in 
today for a weeklong visit aimed at fighting the so-called loneliness factor. 
</P>
<P>
But the wives will not be staying in the plush seaside hotel in the resort of 
Camogli where their men are based during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know when we are going to see them. I guess we'll have to sneak 
over to their place one night," striker Stefan Pettersson said with a smile.
