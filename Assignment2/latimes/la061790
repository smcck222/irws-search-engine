OUTTAKES: CASSEL'S COMEBACK WOULD MAKE A CERTAIN STRAIT-LACED COP HAPPY

He was nominated for an Oscar -- best supporting actor for "Faces" -- in 1968. 
He made a bigger splash in '71, starring as a free-spirited parking attendant 
in "Minnie and Moskowitz" (both films directed by the late John Cassavetes). 
But by the late '70s, Seymour Cassel admits, he had a "compulsive" taste for 
alcohol and drugs and "got carried away with the wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
He wound up doing jail time in 1982 for a conviction of conspiracy to sell 
cocaine -- after doing a "favor" for a friend, he says -- and "came out real 
angry and real bitter." 
</P>
<P>
But in 1985, he went through recovery, got sober -- and started to work again. 
After "Eye of the Tiger" for Scotti Bros., he appeared in "Tin Men" for Disney, 
which proved a turning point, as more roles followed. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he culminated his comeback with two more Disney films: "White Fang," 
which he just finished shooting, third-billed behind Klaus Maria Brandauer and 
Ethan Hawke, and the just-released "Dick Tracy," in which he portrays the 
detective's loyal sidekick, Sam Catchem. He's signed for a "Tracy" sequel, is 
discussing other films with Disney, and has a TV movie in negotiation, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a comeback for me, and I hope it doesn't stop," Cassel says. "This 
business is so forgiving. They'll forgive anything if you have talent and 
straighten out and want to work." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, he takes his one-man show, "Bukowski at Midnight," to 
France. Cassel wrote the piece, using excerpts from the work of hard-living 
cult writer Charles Bukowski. 
</P>
<P>
As for "Dick Tracy," Cassel adds, "We all read the Tracy comics as kids. I 
never thought I'd grow up to play Sam Catchem. And with Al Pacino, Jimmy Caan, 
Estelle Parsons, Warren Beatty (all in the cast) -- it's like getting to work 
with everybody you ever wanted to.

Paramount Pictures has turned up the boost on its "Days of Thunder" promotional 
blitz by enticing several automotive and racing publications to cover the Tom 
Cruise race-car drama as it closes in on its June 27 opening. 
</P>
<P>
The trade journal AutoWeek is on the stands with a cover story titled "Box 
Office Thunder" and upcoming issues of Motor Trend and Circle Track have inside 
pieces on the movie. 
</P>
<P>
More coverage is coming in automotive sections in dozens of newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Molina, the Woodland Hills-based automotive PR specialist brought in to 
coordinate special "Thunder" publicity, is pushing the film's "revolutionary" 
racing footage and the Chevy Lumina that Cruise drives in the picture. He tells 
us that Paramount's put a quartet of Lumina racers "on tour." 
</P>
<P>
The automotive articles, however, will suffer from Cruise Control. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard about what a terrific driver he is -- but couldn't get any access to 
him," says Auto-Week executive editor Kevin Wilson. At the studio's request, 
the magazine sent written questions to Cruise, but "the answers were really 
soft" -- and got scrapped. With a nod to "Thunder" spreads in current issues of 
Sports Illustrated and Life, Wilson muses, "They got lots and lots of access. 
If I'd known we weren't, I might not have committed to the cover." Pat H. 
Broeske and Elaine Dutka

Bo Derek's first film in five years -- "Ghosts Can't Do It" -- recently 
materialized in 16 cities across the country, grossing a paltry $25,000 in two 
weeks. But the actress professes no anguish, admitting the "little $3-million 
movie" could have gone straight to video. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice, intimate entertainment," she tells us, "which means it's 
difficult for it to compete theatrically." 
</P>
<P>
Produced by Bo with husband John Derek -- who's also the writer, director, 
editor and cinematographer -- "Ghosts" is already down to half a dozen 
theaters. At present, Triumph Releasing doesn't have an L.A. showing scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The film is a May-December romance in which screen hubby Anthony Quinn dies and 
returns as a ghost in search of a young, virile male body to inhabit. There's 
nudity -- Bo's -- and a cameo by Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
As for Bo and John's real-life May-December marriage (she's now 33 to his 63): 
"Everything's going well. We're working together -- which is what we want." 
</P>
<P>
They're developing more projects, she says, but she's also "having talks" about 
working in a "mainstream" movie without him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more capable now. I think I could handle it," says the woman who became an 
instant celebrity with the 1979 film "10." 
</P>
<P>
Does she think her career's been sliding ever since? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all. I was so unready for all that happened with '10.' I decided I 
wanted to become the master of my own destiny. I've been learning about 
producing films these last 10 years. And getting the financing.

STAGE WEEK: A CALL FOR PEACE IN THE WAR OF THE SEXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Over the last 10 to 15 years, I've observed a guerrilla warfare breaking out 
between men and women," declared John Herman Shaner, whose staging of his "The 
War Against Women" opens June 27 at the Matrix. "The play is an effort to try 
to understand that epidemic of violence. In the age of Freud, we said, 'These 
men are sick -- aberrations.' Well, I interviewed a lot of them, and let me 
tell you, they don't look very sick. They're functioning just fine in society." 
</P>
<P>
The playwright sighed. "What I'm trying to do is explore those issues in an 
agitprop, Brechtian way -- heavy with symbols, not realism." The story is set 
in a karate dojo (studio), guided by a mysterious sensei(teacher). "Whether 
she's real or unreal we're not sure: she is an ideologue, has a very strong, 
radical-feminist point of view," Shaner said. "The War Against Women" revolves 
around a couple whose marriage is unraveling, and a younger unmarried couple 
"facing the problems of being upwardly mobile, working, and trying to work on a 
relationship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaner, whose "After Crystal Night" played at the Melrose Theatre in '84, has 
also peopled his theatrical landscape with a variety of ethnic types, "generic 
representations of American society, the people who populate its terrain." He 
includes himself in his investigation: "I have mixed feelings about feminism. 
On one hand, it's a thousand years late in coming. But the downside is the 
terrible price we're paying for it now. This play is a call for peace, 
rapprochement. Let this war of the sexes end." 
</P>
<P>
On another, smaller front, director Charles Marowitz, who had been working with 
Shaner on "War" for the past three years, left the show after three weeks of 
rehearsal, and was replaced by Shaner himself. Marowitz insists his departure 
from the project was amiable. "It was sort of a sad situation," noted the 
former Herald-Examiner theater critic and Los Angeles Theatre Center 
dramaturge. "I just wasn't able to do what I wanted. The normal cuts and 
changes I would have made, John resisted. I felt the most honorable, sensible 
thing was to withdraw -- and let him get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: From the missing music department: we were wondering what 
happened to the strains of Joe Cocker singing "You Are So Beautiful to Me," 
which underscored a heart-tugging scene between father and daughter in Israel 
Horovitz's "Strong-Man's Weak Child" (at Los Angeles Theatre Center). Following 
multiple critical barbs aimed at the weepy musical choice, Horovitz cut the 
song, replied a theater rep, confirming that Horovitz has been fiddling with 
the play since its opening. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of "Strong-Man," we also had to wonder if the play's dueling 
weight-lifters (Nick Mancuso and Don Yesso) are really hefting 580-pound 
barbells on stage. It certainly looks real. But the clanking of metal and 
accompanying grunts and groans are only partially genuine, admits the rep. 
"When they add weights, one's real, the other two are made of wood. So they're 
acting to an extent. But not entirely acting."

ON THE RECORD: SONY CLASSICAL'S DEBUT LACKS ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two months ago in these pages, Gunther Breest, the president of Sony Classical, 
the new major label on the block, noted that he wasn't happy with all the 
projects he had inherited from CBS Masterworks, whose catalog and commitments 
are now part of the Sony enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
One wonders how many components of this initial batch of Sony Classical 
releases are original Breest projects, for while it offers certain items of 
value, the sense of adventure promised by the much-publicized debut is lacking 
in the product. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more pleasant surprises are three recordings that may give Zubin 
Mehta's battered reputation a lift. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Strauss' "Alpine Symphony" (45800), universally considered beneath 
contempt a decade ago -- a bombastic, rehashing/trashing of earlier Straussian 
ideas -- has lately insinuated itself into both the catalog and the concert 
repertory through the offices of such celebrity conductors as Karajan, Solti, 
Haitink and Previn. And now Mehta. Whether he adds to what little need be known 
about the work is questionable, but his enthusiasm is palpable, as is the 
sumptuous execution by the Berlin Philharmonic. Junk food for the ears, 
perhaps, but tasty. 
</P>
<P>
The companion piece is the delightful E-flat Horn Concerto, written when 
Strauss wasn't yet rehashing himself, but assimilating ideas picked up from 
Schumann and Mendelssohn. The performance, by the same forces and with BPO 
principal Gerd Seifert as soloist, is absolutely first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
Although the prospect of yet another Bartok Concerto for Orchestra fails to 
excite, Mehta -- for whom slapdash performances became a way of life in New 
York -- combines with the Berlin Philharmonic for an interpretation that is 
cohesive, finely detailed, almost chamberlike in its clarity. The accompanying 
"Miraculous Mandarin" Suite, Bartok's most raucous score, is given the all-out 
virtuoso treatment, and it's a thriller (45748). 
</P>
<P>
Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic do not, however, provide the sensitive 
accompaniment due Murray Perahia's refined interpretations of the Chopin piano 
concertos (44922), but Mehta and the Vienna Philharmonic are congenial, 
gracious partners in the 1990 New Year's concert of music by the waltzing 
Strausses (45808). 
</P>
<P>
Two other conductors featured in Sony's initial outpouring are Daniel Barenboim 
and Pablo Casals. Barenboim is both piano soloist and conductor of the Berlin 
Philharmonic for Beethoven's C-major Concerto and Seventh Symphony in "Das 
Konzert" (45830), which took place last November in the presence of an East 
German audience celebrating the toppling of the Berlin Wall. Musically it is 
redundant; emotionally, it arrives too late. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Barenboim and the BPO provide heavyweight backing for 65-year-old 
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in Mahler's "Wayfarer" and "Wunderhorn" songs (44935), 
both of which he has recorded previously and, not surprisingly, in better vocal 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
The Casals material, originating at the Marlboro Festival in the 1960s, 
consists of the Beethoven First and "Pastorale" (45891) and Seventh and Eighth 
Symphonies (45892) as well as the Bach Second and Third Orchestral Suites 
(45892). 
</P>
<P>
The Beethovens, except for the "Pastorale" all previously released, are in the 
gruffly affectionate vein typical of Casals' work at Marlboro. The Bach suites 
are simply ponderous. The latter disc also offers a set of canons, in effect 
Bach's further variations on the "Goldberg" theme, recorded in 1976, three 
years after Casals' death. The stylistically inapt realization is credited to 
"Marlboro Musicians" and the ensemble features pianist and festival director 
Rudolf Serkin. 
</P>
<P>
The late Vladimir Horowitz's last recording (45818) finds him fussing with 
Chopin but striking sparks with a dynamic, crisply articulated Haydn Sonata in 
E-flat (Hob. 49); and the listener not swept up by the voluptuousness of tone 
and sentiment the venerable pianist brings to Liszt's tarting-up of Isolde's 
"Liebestod" must be made of wallboard. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac Stern's playing is spirited and stylish and Daniel Barenboim is in peak 
form in Schubert's undervalued oeuvre for violin and piano (44504, two discs). 
Together, they capture the music's elusive combination of Romantic sentiment 
and Classical vitality. 
</P>
<P>
The agglomeration of Stern, Jean-Pierre Rampal and Mstislav Rostropovich, on 
the other hand, likely had a better time than those who will be exposed to 
their rough, each-man-for-himself assault on works by Mozart, Telemann, J.C. 
Bach and Reicha (44569). 
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian production of Borodin's complete, four-act "Prince Igor" (44878, 
3 CDs), in many respects admirable, has two gaping holes at the center: Boris 
Martinovich fails to provide the vocal heft (with lashings of cream) demanded 
by the title role, and Nicolai Ghiaurov's once-noble instrument is in tatters, 
with the veteran artist further unable to supply the dramatic punch to pull him 
through the potentially scene-stealing paces of the Polovstian Khan. Nicola 
Ghiuselev blusters amiably as the dissolute Galitsky, and the two women, Stefka 
Evstatieva as Yaroslavna and Alexandra Miltcheva as Konchakovna, are vocally 
accomplished and dramatically alert. 
</P>
<P>
The Sofia Festival Orchestra and National Opera Chorus, both very fine, are 
under the lively, colorful direction of Emil Tchakarov.

A veteran of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and the respected 29th St. Saxophone 
Quartet, alto saxophonist Bobby Watson shows all the right influences -- Johnny 
Hodges, Sonny Stitt and, of course, Charlie Parker -- but doesn't rely on 
imitation to get his point across. Tunes such as his sophisticated ballad 
"Dreams So Real," the smoothly-paced "Homemade Blues" and "Heckle and Jeckle," 
on which Watson trades bird calls with trumpeter Melton Mustafa, put a 
contemporary shine on the hard bop tradition and provide a framework for some 
strong emotional expression. Drummer Victor Lewis also contributes two numbers, 
including "The Shaw of Newark," a spirited tribute to the late trumpeter Woody 
Shaw. BILL KOHLHAASE

This is Rosnes' first album as a leader, and the Vancouver-trained pianist 
takes full advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
Her approach is mainly an extension of 1970s bop; her companions include 
Branford Marsalis on two tunes and Ralph Bowen's muscular tenor on three 
others. Driving solos on her own "I.A. Blues" and Cole Porter's "Everything I 
Love" as well as a fluent examination of Joe Henderson's "Punjab" are 
highlights. Weakening the set are Ron Carter's uninspired bass work, Rosnes' 
synthesizer-and-soprano saxophone duet with Wayne Shorter, and a pretentious 
attempt at a piano duet with Herbie Hancock. Leonard Feather

Anyone who saw the Flowers' Los Angeles shows in '88 and '89 knows that the 
Dublin lads have got the boogie in their soul -- their live roof-raisers 
sometimes rivaled the Southern romps of classic Leon Russell or Delaney &amp; 
Bonnie from an earlier rock era. But the gospel-influenced rave-ups that 
punctuate the band's second album call into question how much soul it can 
squeeze from the boogie. 
</P>
<P>
Such manic exercises as the opening "Hardstone City" and a slow-then-speedy 
version of Johnny Nash's "I Can See Clearly Now" gallop along without 
direction. You expect more from a band that was hailed as a leader for the '90s 
following its 1988 debut. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the scale are a handful of folk-soul hybrids, most notably 
"Christchurch Bells," that show off Liam O'Maonlai's rich voice (equal parts 
Irish forebears Bono and Van Morrison) and convey an earnest, though vague, 
intent to inspire. But they hardly approach similar efforts by the Waterboys, 
not to mention Morrison himself. What works best is the middle ground: "Give It 
Up" and the Middle Eastern-ish "Water" canter seductively, the music fleshing 
out the otherwise sketchy lyrics that characterize the record.

RECORD RACK: *** JOHN HIATT "STOLEN MOMENTS" A&amp;M: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM

<P>
As a songwriter, the rock critics' and fellow-singers' composer of choice hits 
a few potholes this time around -- his paeans to domesticity are trite (if 
intense), and the big ballad is mere made-to-order craftsmanship that must have 
Bonnie Raitt drooling. 
</P>
<P>
But the music is another story: Far more raucous, impulsive and adventurous 
than Hiatt's last album "Slow Turning," this is a rootsy, folk-rockin' sound in 
which Hiatt tosses off emotionally and technically complex lines as if they 
were occurring to him on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
In "Seven Little Indians," the instruments fall casually into place to form a 
taut, meditative backdrop that seems always about to unravel, but never quite 
does -- an appropriate setting for a tale of fragile heritage lost and 
regained. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, twangy guitars and crashing beats evoke the giddiness of his 
celebrations of love and wife and kids. Hiatt has an innately screwball quality 
that gives even this mawkish material an off-center appeal. But he's at his 
best when he has some irony in his diet, or a demon or two to swat at: 
repressed emotions that eat you up ("Back of My Mind"), the ecstasy of their 
release ("Thirty Years if Tears"). 
</P>
<P>
If we sometimes feel that we're sitting in on a self-help testimonial, Hiatt 
periodically bugs his eyes and flaps his arms, rocking madly through a 
Newmanesque portrait of an incorrigible rockabilly cat, or, most intriguingly, 
levitating into the cosmic plane of "Listening to Old Voices," a haunting, 
primordial emanation in which he conjures spirits with a reverence that could

Unlike most female groups, these four R&amp;B singers can really sing -- and do 
some passable rapping too. 
</P>
<P>
Best known for the hit single "Hold on," En Vogue, on its debut album, 
admirably performs a batch of mostly well-crafted ballads and medium-tempo 
songs. Grating, dissonant vocal blends do spoil a few otherwise strong songs. 
The ingeniously arranged "Time Goes On" is the class of this collection. DENNIS

The L.A. trio has a go at our troubled times, offering encouragement to the 
downtrodden with the sentimental spirit and the ramshackle, acousti-rock sound 
of a street-corner Stones. There's also some romance stuff, and a road-tempo 
dope-murder narrative delivered with a hipster twang. It's sometimes 
overbearing, but rhythmically propulsive (former Rockats and Cruzados at work) 
and undeniably good-hearted. Richard Cromelin

LOUD ART, LOUD FOOD AT THE NEW BORDER GRILL; 
</P>
<P>
THE MEXICAN RESTAURANT AIMS TO OVERWHELM -- AND SUCCEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"She's not usually this quiet," confessed the proud mother. Quiet? The kid 
looked hypnotized. 
</P>
<P>
Probably she was just overwhelmed. Imagine being about a year old and immersed 
in the new Border Grill. The dominant color is construction-site orange. The 
walls and the ceiling, a jumble of panels that angle down threateningly close 
to the tables at one point, are covered with huge, brightly colored, cartoon 
drawings by the London artists Su Huntley and Donna Muir, who have also done 
album covers for Sting. 
</P>
<P>
They look like party-time graffiti from a Mexican roadhouse, mostly showing the 
traditional Judas figure of Mexican folk art. With his satanic ears, Judas 
looks rather like a tomcat who has turned into a hardened sinner, defiantly 
puffing on cigars and consorting with skeletons and fallen women. There are 
also naive drawings of planets and rockets, and the wall over the bar 
(separated from the dining area by an orange fence of artfully clumsy planks) 
is covered with big, crudely drawn faces of people getting sloshed, whether 
maniacally, lustfully or despairingly. 
</P>
<P>
The table settings are assertive and vivid themselves: midnight-blue water 
jugs, artlessly fashioned beer glasses in loud colors. The restaurant is loud 
in the literal sense too, of course, like every restaurant Susan Feniger and 
Mary Sue Milliken have ever owned, notably City Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
So of course the 1-year-old was staring around the place bug-eyed. She was 
overwhelmed, like us. This was like Pee-Wee's Playhouse with food. 
</P>
<P>
Border Grill clearly means to overwhelm. The menu aims at the same broad, 
aggressive impact as the decor, a rough immersion in the loud flavors and 
bright colors of Mexico, above all the less familiar dishes of Mexico -- as the 
original Border Grill on Melrose has always done on a smaller scale (it's 
recently been upgraded with similar murals and some of this menu). The result 
is basically irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
Take panuchos. These come four to a plate, each consisting of two tiny, 
paper-thin tortillas sandwiching a filling of black beans, topped with some 
smoky grilled chicken, some salsa, a slice of avocado and a few rings of 
delicious pickled onions. Sometimes, I swear, there's a little dollop of 
something that could be a sort of black pepper salsa. They're impressive: rough 
and elegant at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Or take the specials. One night there was a bread soup -- not a tortilla soup, 
but a bread soup. It was as far from cliche Mexican food as you can imagine, 
consisting of bread cooked to mush in stock that had an insistent walnut-like 
aroma of oregano and the Mexican herb epazote. It looked like a mess (or maybe 
baby food; the baby did look at it appraisingly), but it was impossible to stop 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody liked that one, but I can't say everybody at my table liked the 
spinach salad with lentil dressing. I thought it impressively earthy, though: 
spinach with a dressing of perfectly cooked lentils in lime juice, all topped 
with browned garlic chips. 
</P>
<P>
The usual Mexican seafood appetizers (cocteles, ceviches, salads) can be 
ordered separately or on a big chilled seafood assortment, where they come in 
little rectangular porcelain pots, looking like so many miniature bathtubs. One 
of the 
</P>
<P>
ceviches is shrimp in a light, somehow exhilarating sauce of garlic, lime and 
cilantro; swordfish ceviche comes in a richer, sweeter one of oregano, olives 
and tomatoes. The octopus salad and raw oysters topped with a little bit of 
onion sauce are also a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best appetizers is the simple and unpretentious enchiladas frescas. 
They're just little corn tortillas dipped in a sauce of ground mild red peppers 
and wrapped around a crumbly white cheese, and they have the true bittersweet 
taste of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
However, not everything here is Mexican. Milliken and Feniger reached down to 
Peru for the anticuchos: two tiny skewers of grilled beef heart. The little 
chunks of heart have a wonderfully smoky flavor and are more tender than you'd 
expect. Incidentally, the avocado corn relish on the side is probably a bit 
hotter than you expect. 
</P>
<P>
There's a Caesar salad, quite appropriate since the Caesar was invented in 
Tijuana. The version here, which is slightly quixotic by local standards, is 
fresh and pleasant and seems to be the original Caesar's Cafe recipe. Sparing 
the anchovies but leaning into the garlic, it mostly tastes of lemon juice and 
olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everything on the appetizer side of the menu is impressive in one 
way or another. The Oaxacan pickled pigs' feet salad, however, is a bit 
disappointing. In its savory hash of vinegar and red and yellow sweet peppers, 
the chopped (practically minced) pigs' feet are so polite they're not much more 
than a texture. Of course, that may be exactly how a lot of people want their 
pigs' feet. 
</P>
<P>
The most impressive entree proves to be the most baroque, octopus veracruzana. 
Red snapper veracruzana is of course a classic Mexican dish, which Mexican 
restaurants in our part of the world unaccountably make into a very dull dish. 
This dish has nothing in common with them. The octopus is dressed with red and 
yellow peppers, black olives and yellow grapes (!) on a bed of rice sopping 
with a wild, slightly sweet sauce full of cumin and (of all unexpected, 
curry-like spices) turmeric. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the best thing after that operatic extravaganza is the simple 
grilled fish, which is always smoky and perfectly cooked, often arranged on 
some odd foundation, such as guacamole mixed with salsa and lime juice. If you 
want a wilder fish, there's one wrapped in tortillas along with olives and 
pieces of potato. The whole satchel of stuff is then fried. This is what you 
might call the sloppy-sexy school of Mexican cooking. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of that style around here, the sort of thing that would horrify a 
French chef (actually, probably all of Mexican cooking would horrify a 
traditional French chef). The epitome is the chicken chilaquiles: chicken and 
corn masa mixed with sliced onions and the odd pepper, baked in some tortillas. 
It comes out a sort of savory mush, served with a tart tomatillo sauce and a 
rather pedestrian tomato sauce. Exotic comfort food. 
</P>
<P>
The grilled and vinegared turkey, a dish already known at City Restaurant, is 
also groomed for a rugged, South of the Border look, sliced into big irregular 
leaves. Sabana, a thin steak evidently marinated in lime juice, also has an 
apparently conscious weirdness. It's very tasty, but the lime juice gives it an 
odd, puffy texture some people truly hate. 
</P>
<P>
The braised lamb shanks are served in a hearty, rough-and-ready way, the 
shanks, with the meat practically falling off them, stuck in a bowl of sweet, 
dark-brown lamb broth flavored with lots of oregano. The bland hunks of 
unmeltable Mexican cheese floating around in it are apparently for color and 
texture contrast only. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody liked the braised duck, a very fat-free skinless duck topped with 
soft, boiled onions. The pile of lentils on one side had a nice bit of lime 
flavor. On the other side was a stunning contrast to this carnal, earthy 
assembly: an ethereal salad of oranges and jicama sliced paper-thin. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most unpromising things turn out to be great, like the red bean 
stew, a vegetarian dish of red beans, slightly tart, very rich, not at all 
bitter. There are some chunks of carrots, squash and plantain floating around 
in it, more for contrast than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Great stuff. But it must be said that the tacos are a real disappointment. The 
Yucatan lobster tacos (there are several other fillings available) have plenty 
of lobster on them, along with some salsa and guacamole; perhaps too much -- 
they're a soggy mess. The griddled tacos include a lamb taco that's always sold 
out, even as early as 7 in the evening, so I assume they're good. The carnitas 
model, though, is pretty pedestrian, especially at $12 for a small plate. 
</P>
<P>
The chicken pibil may be all too authentic. It's genuinely steamed in banana 
leaf, but extremely bland. Spices might help, some black beans on the side 
would surely help, but as it is, this dish is just steamed chicken with rice 
and some middleweight tomato and cilantro sauces. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert list is a whole menu on its own and includes some stupendous 
treats. The lime pie is positively furry with tan curlicues of shredded toasted 
coconut; it looks like a Muppet. The Mexican chocolate cream cake is a savagely 
rich chocolate concoction dosed with cinnamon and clove. 
</P>
<P>
The blueberry pie has a graham crust, but oddly only the top crust. Still, it 
is filled with smashingly good blueberries. There's a nice guava cheese tart, 
the obvious Latin American dessert combination of cream cheese and guava 
preserves encased in flaky pastry, a very foreign-looking tart about half an 
inch high. 
</P>
<P>
The safest bets among the desserts are the ices -- things like light and 
refreshing tequila-and-lime ice spotted with chia seed, served in big, tall 
glasses. The rest of the desserts, however, are on the not-so-overwhelming side 
of the Mexican spectrum, the sort of sweets that taste like breakfast rather 
than dessert. Fried plantains with strawberries. An unfrosted walnut cake. A 
dense upside-down cake is a whole lot like coffee cake topped with pecans, 
dried apricots and prunes. 
</P>
<P>
They don't serve breakfast at Border Grill, but they do have a weekend brunch 
with all sorts of Mexican egg dishes, including a papadzules, an exotic 
Yucatecan deal where hard-boiled eggs are wrapped in tortillas and topped with 
pumpkin seeds. If you want to avoid eggs, you can have pancakes made from 
batter that includes banana chunks, served with shredded coconut, guava jam, 
coconut syrup and cream. 
</P>
<P>
So what do we think? We're overwhelmed. Time will tell whether this kind of 
loud, sleeve-tugging cookery wears well (the panels of cartoon art feel pretty 
temporary to me). But for the time being, we're impressed. Aren't we, kid?

NOTEBOOK: THOSE SELVAGGIO RUMORS: NOW THEY'RE TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There have been frequent rumors (and even a few published reports) over the 
past three or four years that Piero Selvaggio, proprietor of the top-rated 
Valentino in Santa Monica and Primi in West Los Angeles, was about to open a 
third local restaurant. These rumors (and reports) have repeatedly turned out 
to be incorrect. Now, though, Selvaggio tells me that he definitely has a new 
place in the works -- and that Primi is in for a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
Primi first: Beginning next month, Selvaggio says: "We're going to trim the 
menu somewhat, cutting down on the number of truly sophisticated dishes. In the 
space that is left over from this trimming, we are going to add certain hearty, 
traditional Italian dishes. We won't serve just antipasto and pasta any 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
Some of these dishes might surprise those who know the alternately innovative 
and authentic regional Italian food Selvaggio has traditionally served: "You 
know," he says, "we all secretly love sausage and peppers, veal parmigiana, 
pasta with ragu. I want to include things like that. I don't want the 
restaurant to be seen as just a cheaper version of Valentino." He adds that 
Primi also is due for a slight name change, -- to Primi +, or Primi Plus -- or, 
as he prefers it, in Italian, Primi Piu. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Sherman Oaks, Selvaggio plans to take over the site of the old 
Fiore d'Italia on Ventura Boulevard, where he will install a restaurant called 
Posto ("Place" in Italian). "We're still thinking about everything we can do," 
he answers, "but I want to have a little box on the menu with three or four 
kinds of lasagna, and another box with maybe several pastas with different 
kinds of meatballs. And the heart of the restaurant, what it will be designed 
around, is a large grill, which will have people on both sides, grilling 
everything -- meat, fish, vegetables. It will be very straightforward, very 
simple." Selvaggio hopes to open Posto early next year. 
</P>
<P>
It might be seen as more than a little ironic that Selvaggio, who has been a 
critic of L.A.'s recent restaurant-opening mania, and who freely refers to "all 
the unfilled seats in Italian restaurants" hereabouts, is adding to this town's 
(Italian) restaurant population. 
</P>
<P>
"But what else can I do?" he asks. "This is the business I know, and after five 
years of Primi, I've learned that it is possible to have more than one 
restaurant without eclipsing the first one. And I have so many talented 
employees who will eventually leave me if I don't give them room to grow." He 
adds, "Wolfgang Puck, who himself is now involved in five restaurants, has been 
a great inspiration to me in this idea." 
</P>
<P>
GLADSTONE'S 4 PESCE?: Both Bob Morris (Gladstone's 4 Fish, R.J.'s the Rib 
Joint) and Silvio De Mori (Tuttobene) told me they were shocked last week to 
see an item in Bruce David Colen's "Dining Out" column in this month's Los 
Angeles Magazine, revealing that the two had "just inked papers" to combine 
their talents on a chain of half-a-dozen restaurants up and down the California 
coast. "I don't know how he got the news," they said in virtually the same 
words. "Silvio and I are in very sensitive negotiations," Morris continued, 
"but nothing has yet been signed." Nevertheless, De Mori confirms that the 
story is -- barring the signatures -- true. If the deal is completed, he says, 
the first restaurant (no name has yet been chosen) will indeed be in Marina del 
Rey, as Colen reported. And more are indeed planned. "What we are looking for 
with these places," De Mori adds, "is good food, real Italian, very Italian. 
And big. Marina del Rey will have about 280 seats. I'm taking care of the basic 
concept, training the chefs, the menu. I will use my skills, Bob will use his. 
It's very stimulating to work with him. He and his organization are the first 
really, really professional people I've ever met in this business." 
</P>
<P>
NEW TABLES IN TOWN: Somi Rehil, proprietor of India's Cuisine in Tarzana, has 
opened a second restaurant, Sheesh Mahal (Crystal Palace) on Pico Boulevard 
just east of La Cienega. . . . Roger Lee, former executive chef at Peng Yuan in 
Monterey Park and the Mandarin in Beverly Hills and then chef and co-owner of 
Abacus in West Los Angeles, has opened a new place of his own, Hunan Garden, in 
Lomita. . . . And Ernie Criezis, proprietor of the Great Greek Cafe and the 
Moonlight Tango Cafe, both in Sherman Oaks, has opened Cafe Athens, on the site 
of the former 1000 Wilshire and (very briefly) Mille Ristorante in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
ARTY EATS: Supporters of the so-called 'Big Green' initiative on the November 
ballot will have a chance to help the cause, win good art by top-name artists, 
and enjoy food supplied by DC-3, Rebecca's, the West Beach Cafe, Citrus, and 
the Broadway Deli, at an event entitled 'Artists United for Big Green' -- to be 
held next Saturday from 1 to 4 p.m., at DC-3 in Santa Monica. Works by Lita 
Albuquerque, Charles Arnoldi, Don Bachardy, John Baldessari, Sam Francis, Frank 
Gehry, Robert Graham, David Hockney, Ed Moses, Ed Ruscha, DeWain Valentine, and 
more than 20 other artists will be raffled off (tickets are $100 apiece, and 
the art may be previewed at the West Beach Cafe through Friday). Celebrities 
attending the event include Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden (though presumably not 
together), Martin Short, and Ed Begley, Jr. Admission tickets are $75 each. 
Call (213) 395-1990 for further information. 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANT MISCELLANY: Axel Dikkers, longtime sous-chef at the Regency Club in 
Westwood and more recently executive chef at Camelions in Santa Monica, has 
taken over the kitchen at the once-acclaimed Tower in downtown Los Angeles. . . 
. Hiroo Iimura is the new executive chef at Mikado in North Hollywood, 
replacing ex-Imperial Gardens chef Shinozaki Ayao, who had joined the 
restaurant with some fanfare in March. . . . Victor Sodsook, executive chef and 
co-owner of the Siamese Princess in West Hollywood, has published his own 
cookbook, "I Love Thai Food." The book, produced for Sodsook in Thailand, 
includes color photographs and recipes from top Bangkok restaurants, as well as 
Sodsook's own recipes. It is available at the restaurant, or may be ordered by 
mail (call the Siamese Princess for further information). . .

I find it interesting that the letters defending New Kids on the Block ("Oh, 
You Kids," June 10) appeared on the same day as the article in which their 
manager admitted that New Kids sometimes lip-sync during their concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The way I see it, New Kids are cleverly promoted entertainers rather than 
musicians with any sort of artistic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
I hardly think their new album merits a five-star rating (as Michelle Parkinson 
suggested in her letter), unless we're giving points for unadulterated 
commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
As for the adults that go to New Kids' concerts with their children, one 
wonders how many parents are there involuntarily simply because most of New 
Kids' fans are too young to go to concerts unattended. Chris Willman's negative 
review of "Step by Step" certainly won't stop it from selling millions of 
copies, but the fact is that, as musicians, New Kids on the Block are great 
dancers.

Live, in media land, means real. It means what the audience member sees and 
hears in concerts is what is happening right there and then -- not what 
happened in the studio six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
For a concertgoer, it means that the interaction between the person on the 
stage and the audience is genuine, not contrived, not premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
Backing vocals are the antithesis of what a "live concert" is supposed to be 
about. As a consumer, I already paid upward of $10 for the album or cassette 
that made me think the performer was worth going to see live. If Headlee thinks 
I am not being hoodwinked by having to pay upwards of $25 to hear that exact 
same music at a so-called "live concert," he is only demonstrating his own lack 
of integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Real artists, the people I pay to see perform, would never give me anything 
less than authenticity. When is the last time Sting, U2, Prince or 10,000 
Maniacs used any kind of backing vocals or taped instrumentation? Tina Turner, 
Paul McCartney and David Bowie are old (in rock 'n' roll terms, of course) and 
their voices aren't all of what they once were, but when you see and hear them 
in concert it is truly them.

You want us to believe that he's a sweet, sensitive guy and that the Diceman is 
just an act. So I can't help but wonder -- what if the baby he's expecting is 
born with physical or mental handicaps? Will the Diceman still think those 
jokes are funny? What if that child chooses a homosexual lifestyle or selects a 
mate of another race and gives him "urine-colored" grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Diceman still be laughing? 
</P>
<P>
As the mother of a handicapped child, I am far too aware of the ignorance and 
bigotry that is focused on those who are born into a life of challenge. His act 
merely encourages this ignorance to fester and grow to it's enormous, ugly 
potential. For every joke he tells, a thousand mothers have cried themselves to 
sleep in pain for the way their children are treated. And if handing one 
unfortunate individual $1,000 is all it takes to clear his conscience, then he 
never really had one.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD BE COST-EFFECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. GORDONBD DAVID M. GORDON is professor of economics at the New 
School for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of our nation's greatest shames is our health-care system. We spend 
hundreds of billions of dollars on health care while neglecting the basic 
health needs of millions of Americans. When will we wake up to the urgent need 
for a more rational, less wasteful and more equitable health-care system? 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, a growing majority of people is beginning to favor dramatic 
changes in our health-care system. I support that inclination with an argument 
that national health insurance would make good economic sense and, quite 
likely, promote better health. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the sources of discontent with the health-care system are familiar. In 
1986, for example, 38 million Americans did not have any insurance coverage -- 
public or private. Children comprised more than a third of this uncovered 
population. 
</P>
<P>
It has become worse during the slash-and-burn years of right-wing policies in 
Washington. Between 1980 and 1988, the number of people without health 
insurance increased by 4 million. The number of Americans who do not have a 
regular source of care increased by 65%. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these problems have arisen from the trend toward a profit orientation 
in the health-care system. While other countries regard health and health care 
as a public good, the United States has been moving toward a system in which 
health problems provide an opportunity for private business to turn a tidy 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, for example, 78% of admitting physicians reported pressure from their 
hospitals to reduce patients' length of stay, especially patients whose 
problems were considered "unprofitable." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its failure to care for vast sectors of the population, the U.S. health 
care system is extravagantly expensive. Private and public health expenditures 
in the United States in 1986 constituted 11.1% of gross domestic product, or 
$1,926 per person per year. 
</P>
<P>
No other country came close in per-capita expenditures: Canada, Switzerland and 
Sweden, the runners-up, spent $1,370, $1,217 and $1,195 per capita, roughly 
two-thirds the U.S. figure. We in the United States -- through our medical 
insurance bills, our taxes and our payments to medical personnel and 
institutions -- paid top dollar. What did we get in return? 
</P>
<P>
Judging by standard health statistics -- infant mortality and life expectancy 
at birth -- not much. Far from enjoying a substantial lead over industrial 
economies paying substantially less for health care, the United States comes in 
close to last. Thirteen countries had lower infant mortality rates in 1988; 12 
had higher life expectancies at birth. 
</P>
<P>
The comparison to Canada is particularly instructive. As we have seen, Canada 
spent $1,370 on health care in 1986, two-thirds of the U.S. figure. The 
government funded 76% of Canadian health expenditures. The country's infant 
mortality rate in 1988 was less than two-thirds that of the United States, 
while life expectancy at birth was two years greater. Canada trailed the United 
States in both these categories before the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
How did Canada overtake the United States in these health-status measures while 
spending much less per capita? In 1966, Canadian health expenditures as a 
fraction of gross national product were identical to those of the United 
States, and both were rising. In that year, Canada introduced a national health 
program that made federal and provincial governments responsible for the 
medical insurance of the population. The federal-provincial health insurance 
system contracts with the private sector for delivery of services. A wide range 
of recent studies attribute improvement in the effectiveness of the Canadian 
system to this fundamental change in the orientation of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
These are comparisons based on "objective" indicators. The subjective evidence 
also supports these comparisons: The Canadians and the British like their 
systems better than we like ours, according to respondents answering questions 
about the degree of satisfaction with hospital stays and doctor visits in a 
1988 survey comparing the Canadian, U.K. and U.S. systems. 
</P>
<P>
And while Canadians and the British prefer their own systems over either of the 
other two by wide margins, those surveyed in the United States overwhelmingly 
preferred the Canadian system to that prevailing in the United States in the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
There is no reason -- other than the power of those who profit from the status 
quo -- why the United States could not have a system similar to Canada's. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, large majorities of people in the United States favor 
fundamental change in the health-care system. In the same 1988 survey, for 
example, 60% of respondents in the United States agreed that "fundamental 
changes are needed to make 'the U.S. health-care system' work better," while 
another 29% agreed that "our health-care system has so much wrong with it that 
we need to completely rebuild it." 
</P>
<P>
Only 10% agreed that "only minor changes are necessary to make it work better," 
while only 1% of respondents were "not sure." 
</P>
<P>
In another recent survey, 75% of respondents wanted the government to establish 
a national health program. 
</P>
<P>
Based on per-capita expenditure, if the United States had had the Canadian 
system in 1989, we would have spent $138.1 billion less on health care. That 
would have been a savings of 2.6% of gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
People speak about the possible "peace dividend" that may result from a thaw in 
the Cold War. The "national health-care dividend" could be just as large. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who favor more decent social policies in the United States are 
confronted with a persistent refrain: Such policy changes would cost too much 
-- we can't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
The case of health care turns that familiar refrain on its head. We could enjoy 
better health care in this country and pay less for it at the same time. Now, 
more than ever, it's time for a universal national health insurance system in 
the United States.

LAWMAKERS SCRAMBLING TO RESTORE BENEFITS FOR OLDER WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, CATHERINE COLLINS is a Washington writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
True or false: Older workers enjoy the same benefits as their younger 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
True once. False today. 
</P>
<P>
With a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last June, 20 years of legal precedent went up 
in smoke. Although the court agreed that in matters of hiring, wages and 
firing, age discrimination is against the law, it ruled that the same law does 
not cover benefits, such as severance pay, employee group insurance and 
disability income. 
</P>
<P>
The case that returned the Age Discrimination Employment Act to the headlines 
after two decades of occasional legal skirmishes involved June Betts, a former 
speech pathologist for Hamilton County, Ohio. She was diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease at age 58, yet managed to work until she was 61. 
</P>
<P>
Her dedication led to her eventual problems. Under Ohio's public employee 
pension plan, disability retirements are permitted only through age 60. Had 
Betts retired earlier and taken disability pay, she could have collected $350 a 
month. Because she waited, she receives only $158 a month, the usual 
early-retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Ohio PERS (Public Employees Retirement System) is penalizing my mother for 
working as long as she was physically and mentally able to work, by denying her 
the benefits she has earned," Carolyn Betts, a daughter of June Betts, wrote in 
a May 9 letter to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Betts sued, arguing that the Ohio law was discriminatory. The lower courts 
ruled in favor of Betts, relying on the "equal benefit or equal cost" rule 
established by the Labor Department in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Supreme Court reversed the lower courts and went against Betts last 
summer, Congress jumped into the fray. Members from both parties are scrambling 
to restore things to where they were before the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. David Pryor (D-Ark.), Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and James Jeffords 
(R-Vt.), have proposed the older workers benefits protection bill. It passed 
the Labor and Human Resources Committee in February and will arrive on the 
Senate floor with 41 co-sponsors within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Augustus Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), Matthew Martinez (D-Monterey Park), 
Edward Roybal (D-Los Angeles) and William Clay (D-Mo.) are sponsoring similar 
legislation in the House, where they have garnered more than 100 co-sponsors. 
The House bill is expected to come up for a vote after the Senate acts. 
</P>
<P>
Both bills state that the age discrimination legislation prohibits bias in 
employee benefits, and both reinstate long-standing "equal benefit or equal 
cost" regulations. Both bills also would stop employers from using anything 
other than retiree health benefits as an offset against non-age-related 
benefits, such as severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
"The pensions of America's workers are federally protected and this provision 
will prevent employers from using pensions to deny other benefits to older 
workers," said Pryor. "It will also act as an incentive for more employers to 
offer retiree health benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bush Administration initially supported the Betts' family's 
efforts, filing a "friend of the court" brief and testifying before Congress on 
their behalf, it has had a change of heart and threatened to veto the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation has the support of advocacy groups for the aging, such as the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons, and major labor unions. Business and 
industry groups, such as the National Assn. of Manufacturers and the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, applauded the Supreme Court's action and are lobbying 
heavily against both bills. 
</P>
<P>
"We are strongly opposed to the legislation as it is written because rather 
than provide increased benefit protection to older workers, we fear it would 
ultimately result in fewer benefits to all employees," said Ed Gilroy, 
associate director of employee benefits and compensation at the National Assn. 
of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repairing a Snafu in Minimum Wage Law 
</P>
<P>
There is some costly confusion on Capitol Hill about a provision of the new 
Minimum Wage Law. While raising to $500,000 a year in revenue the threshold at 
which a business must pay the minimum, an old exemption covering interstate 
commerce somehow disappeared. That means that for many enterprises, the 
small-business exemption is no more. 
</P>
<P>
As the law now reads, any employee engaging in interstate commerce must be paid 
the federal minimum wage, regardless of the employer's annual revenue. That 
means that the guys unloading a grocery truck that crossed state lines must 
receive minimum wage. And the clerk who places a telephone order must be paid 
minimum wage, as must the waiter who accepts an out-of-state credit card. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, this makes the small-business exemption useless, particularly in a 
business like a restaurant, where 70% of the employees might be engaged 
unwittingly in interstate commerce," said Mark Gorman, senior director of 
governmental affairs at the National Restaurant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Help may be on the way. Rep. Steve Bartlett (R-Texas) is drafting an amendment 
that he hopes will remedy the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clearly unintentional," he said. "The language of the statute was clear 
that we were eliminating many of the complicated exemptions and replacing them 
with a one-size-fits-all threshold of $500,000. I'm told by attorneys that it 
was misdrafted and resulted in the practical elimination of the small-business 
exemption." 
</P>
<P>
Bartlett said he expects the amendment to pass easily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chamber's Ambitious Educational Goals 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has gone back to school: It has founded the Center 
for Workforce Preparation and Quality Education. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber hopes to find answers to the country's education woes on the local 
level and provide a bridge between community business leaders and local 
educators. 
</P>
<P>
"For employers, a deficient education system means an ill-prepared work force, 
a decline in product quality, and an inability to compete," said the chamber's 
prospectus for the program. 
</P>
<P>
The center has adopted the same goals for the year 2000 that President Bush 
established last fall: Have all children start school ready to learn through an 
expanded preschool program, such as Head Start; increase the high school 
graduation rate to 90%; have American students rank first in the world in math 
and science; improve the adult literacy rate to 100%; and rid schools of drugs 
and violence. 
</P>
<P>
Information is available through the chamber at 202-463-5525.

MONEY TALK: BANKS SHOULD FIX ERRORS IN PROCESSING CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Earlier this year I wrote a check for $19.79 to pay my telephone bill. But 
when I received my bank statement I was surprised to see that the check had 
been processed erroneously for $39.74. When I complained to the manager at my 
savings branch, I was told that they were required to honor the amount the 
utility company had encoded on the check, regardless of whether it was right or 
not. Is the savings and loan correct in refusing to adjust my account to 
reflect the amount that I actually wrote on the check? I should think so. -- S. 
V. F. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your question raises some interesting issues not only about how checks are 
processed in these days of automation, but also about customer relations. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, a telephone company data processing clerk made an error encoding 
your check for processing at its bank. By the way, a depositor's bank typically 
is responsible for encoding checks, a process that adds a series of numbers 
across the back of the checks to be read by high-speed, electronic check 
sorting equipment. However, large corporations that make huge daily deposits -- 
such as utilities -- often have in-house clerks handling the task. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the error, and the manner in which your institution handled your 
complaint. Pressure to maximize earnings and cut costs has put a crimp in the 
amount of customer service available at banks and thrifts these days. As you 
well know, many services that you once received free now come with a charge. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the consumer relations managers we talked to generally agreed that your 
request is not out of line. According to Roger Repogle, manager of item 
processing at the Federal Reserve Bank, any bank or thrift should be able to 
help its customers unravel a simple error of this type. In fact, Repogle says 
your institution should initiate the process of tracking the error back to its 
source and making the necessary changes. 
</P>
<P>
Repogle says many institutions, as a matter of customer courtesy, will simply 
credit a customer's account for the amount of the error. Then, the institution 
will tackle the adjustment process on its own, or simply absorb the difference 
if it's too small to be worth the time and trouble to recover. 
</P>
<P>
"In no case does the customer have to absorb the error," Repogle says. "And the 
customer shouldn't have to unravel it himself. He's simply not equipped to go 
through the process of decoding and making the adjustments throughout the 
banking system." 
</P>
<P>
As a final note, you might want to check whether the telephone company 
discovered the error on its books and already credited your telephone balance 
with the overpayment. You shouldn't have to pay for the error, but you 
shouldn't make money on it, either. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's Bondholder's Job to Monitor Investment 
</P>
<P>
Q: I purchased a California school district bond that paid interest 
semiannually in August and February. I put the bond in my safe deposit box, 
thinking that the trustee would notify me at maturity with redemption 
instructions. When my February interest check did not arrive I checked the bond 
and discovered that it had matured the previous August. I have since redeemed 
the bond. I have also demanded interest for the six months that I held it after 
its maturity. My reasoning is that the trustee should have notified me about 
redeeming it. Do I have a winnable case? -- H. E. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your best bet is to take all materials pertaining to your bond purchase and 
redemption to a qualified attorney for evaluation. It is possible that the 
trustee was remiss in failing to notify you of the bond's pending maturity. If 
so, you may have a case. 
</P>
<P>
However, according to our experts, bonds typically are not repaid until the 
bearer demands it, leaving the responsibility entirely with the holder. The 
lesson here for everyone -- bondholders, stockholders and others -- is to 
review your holdings regularly to keep track of such matters as maturity dates, 
dividend payments and option exercise deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
The other course of action is to leave your holdings with a brokerage that 
would handle this responsibility. However, you will pay for this service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Before You Buy an Annuity 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have an annuity with Capital Life that has just begun paying off. The 
company has a relatively low rating (BBB+) with Standard &amp; Poor's. I am 
wondering whether my principal and the projected interest payments are at risk 
if the company becomes unable to meet its obligations. -- M. L. 
</P>
<P>
A: The simple answer is: Yes, you are at risk. And in California, there is no 
insurance fund to cover annuities that go into default. So, theoretically, you 
stand to lose both your initial investment as well as the potential payout. 
</P>
<P>
None of this should be construed to mean that your annuity underwriter has a 
great likelihood of falling into difficulty. The S&amp;P rating of this company 
has not been at the highest levels in recent years. And if you had researched 
its ratings, or had your broker given you the information when you purchased 
the annuity, you could have discovered this. The larger moral is that you 
should thoroughly understand what you are buying when you invest.

MARKETS: COLLECTORS CASH IN ON OLD FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1947, George Steffes paid $100 for 100 shares of Tucker Corp. common 
stock. The check barely cleared the bank before Tucker, an upstart auto company 
with uniquely designed cars, went broke. The 100 shares were worthless. 
</P>
<P>
But now -- 43 years later -- Steffes could get his money back. Thanks to a 
popular movie about Tucker, as well as a growing interest in historically 
significant financial documents, the Tucker stock certificate that has been 
sitting in Steffes' drawer would fetch about $100 at auction. 
</P>
<P>
"Collectors are getting more interested in these kinds of collectibles. They 
find them colorful and interesting," says Diana Herzog, president of R. M. 
Smythe &amp; Co., which is holding its annual auction of financial documents 
this weekend in Memphis. "The hobby is still within the range of people who no 
longer want to spend a lot of money for paintings, prints or coins." 
</P>
<P>
When the auction is over, Herzog expects about 500 lots of financial documents 
to have been sold -- for a total of about $1 million. That auction's average of 
$2,000 per lot isn't going to make Sotheby's quiver. But experts say prices 
have been rising steadily the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, financial-document hobbyists are delighting over reports that American 
corporations may do away with paper stock and bond certificates in favor of 
computer entries. They believe that the change could make their collections 
skyrocket in price. 
</P>
<P>
Even if financial documents don't become as prized as a Mickey Mantle rookie 
baseball card, collectors say they get pleasure just owning -- for so small a 
price -- a piece of history. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't advise anybody to go into this with the idea of making money. It's 
for your fun, for your pleasure. If the thing goes up in value -- hooray," says 
Sanford Hock, a stockbroker with Paine Webber &amp; Co. in Beverly Hills. He 
has more than 250 historical financial documents. 
</P>
<P>
Among his holdings are a large number of Confederate bonds; a lottery ticket 
signed by George Washington that he estimates is worth about $5,000; a stock 
certificate for Charles Chaplin Productions, signed by Charlie, with an 
estimated value of $4,500, and a receipt for work on a church bell signed by 
Paul Revere. Hock says he paid $6,500 for the Revere piece last year. 
</P>
<P>
The most valuable financial document so far is a stock receipt for the East 
India Company dated 1657. Because it is believed to be the oldest piece of 
stock paper in private hands, it sold in 1989 at auction for $42,500. 
</P>
<P>
As in any other hobby, most of the people who dabble in these collectibles know 
what to look for. Many are employed in the financial industry. 
</P>
<P>
The experts say amateurs should be alert for three types of documents. 
</P>
<P>
First are those bearing important signatures. Many famous industrialists signed 
early stock certificates for their companies. 
</P>
<P>
Haley Garrison of Williamsburg, Va., an expert on antique stocks and bonds, 
said the most prized signatures are those of John Jacob Astor and his son 
William, J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie, 
Stephen Girard, Marshall Field, Henry Ford, Jay Gould, Meyer Guggenheim, Andrew 
Mellon, Henry Wells and William Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
The second thing to look for are financial papers of historical significance 
and, third, papers of exceptional beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks and bonds aren't valuable just because they are old. A 500-ruble Russian 
bond issued by the czarist government in 1912 was recently found in Los 
Angeles. But it has no value to collectors because, in the waning days of that 
regime, such bonds were as common as ditch water. 
</P>
<P>
Most people who find themselves holding financial collectibles are no more 
collectors than kids who bought baseball cards in the 1950s were investors. 
What makes financial collectibles exciting is that it is still possible to 
stumble onto valuable finds in a way that is no longer likely with paintings, 
coins or even baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy came to me recently with a bond of the Erie Railroad Co.," says 
Garrison. It turned out to be a rough draft signed by financier Jay Gould. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison says it is probably worth between $10,000 and $15,000 -- with 60% of 
the value attributable to its historical significance and 40% to Gould's 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
"Valuable stock and bond certificates are very frequently found by individuals 
in the papers or belongings of relatives," notes Scott Winslow, a dealer in 
Nashua, N.H. He says an 80-year-old woman recently found a pile of stock 
certificates for mining companies that dated to the turn of the century. "The 
companies all went bust, and (the stocks and bonds) had no negotiable value," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
"But today they have collectible value because of the quality of the graphics. 
They had vignettes of mining scenes," says Winslow. He estimates that each 
certificate is worth about $150. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fairly common occurence," Winslow adds. 
</P>
<P>
Even more common, however, is an old stock certificate that isn't pretty, 
wasn't signed by someone famous, doesn't have its history rooted in some 
important event and isn't worth a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
Novices should also remember that cashing in big on an old stock they might 
unearth isn't easy. Getting a fix on the true price of an old stock is 
difficult. One expert estimates that the Tucker certificate is worth $15 and 
another $250. 
</P>
<P>
Also, finding a buyer may be difficult, since there may be as few as 20,000 
collectors right now. "We're a relatively new hobby," says Garrison, who is 
helping organize the biggest auction ever for financial documents. It is to be 
held in Dusseldorf, West Germany, in September. 
</P>
<P>
Why Dusseldorf? "Because Europeans are avid collectors of American financial 
history," says Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Spenders Don't Have Corner on Deficits 
</P>
<P>
State and local governments are learning from the federal government how to 
spend more than they make. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Commerce Department, state and local governments had a 
record $45.7 billion deficit in the fourth quarter of 1989. That combined 
deficit was the worst one ever recorded. The deficit dropped to $44.6 billion 
in the first quarter of 1990 -- the last period for which there are figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers we have at the moment indicate that the deficit has gotten 
considerably worse," says a Commerce Department source. "This has been going on 
for a few years." 
</P>
<P>
State and local governments started running deficits in the fourth quarter of 
1986 after more than three years of surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
There have been deficits in the recent past, according to Commerce Department 
stats -- specifically from 1970 to 1972; from late 1973 to 1976 and briefly in 
1980 and 1982. But the magnitude of the current aggregate deficit among the 
states and locals dwarfs any from the past. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the department will put out deficit statistics for the first quarter 
of 1990. It will also revise and update its statistics from the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the problem is occuring in the Northeast, but Louisiana and West 
Virginia are perennially in bad shape and parts of Florida and California are 
also piling up debt, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that local and state governments -- like their federal 
counterpart -- will soon have to come up with ways of either generating more 
revenue, or they'll have to cut spending dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Johnson's Departure Leaves Void at the Fed 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Johnson's decision to leave the vice chairmanship of the Federal Reserve 
Board to become a professor could have some serious effects on the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, Johnson's move could give chairman Alan Greenspan an even 
stronger voice in policy decisions. On the negative side, Johnson's departure 
will leave the Fed without a well-versed liaison with foreign central banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign central bankers are all sorry to see him go," says one source with 
strong contacts in those circles. "With his departure, the international side 
of the Fed needs some strengthening," says this source. The Fed and foreign 
central banks, of course, have been coordinating monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
The International Assn. of Financial Planning in Atlanta says Americans who 
responded to a recent survey believe that the 1990s will be a decade of 
decreasing economic opportunities. The most pessimistic respondents, the survey 
found, were those 35- to 44-year-olds who see their retirement plans hurt by 
the need to put their children through college and care for aging parents. The 
survey found that 61% of those answering were less inclined to take financial 
risks now and 62% are more inclined to save money over the next 10 years . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mara Balsbaugh, entertainment analyst at Smith Barney &amp; Co., recently told 
clients that a 3-for-1 stock split is a "strong possibility" for Time Warner 
Inc. in the near to intermediate term. She also expects Time Warner to announce 
some "fairly significant restructuring moves . . . involving asset and/or 
equity stake sales, potentially eliminating billions of dollars in debt." . . . 
</P>
<P>
In a recent conference call with Prudential-Bache analysts, Sharon Vuinovich, 
McDonald's Corp.'s head of financial communications and investor relations, 
indicated that the burger company was disappointed with its second quarter. 
"We're all looking for a pickup. Our comparisons in the second quarter will be 
the easiest comparisons that we'll have all year. But, at the same time, I have 
to tell you that we aren't seeing any substantial pickup in business right now 
. . . So I guess we'll just have to see," said Vuinovich in the Pru-Bache 
transcript of the call. . .

ANIMAL AGRICULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patt Morrison's article, "Waste Not" (June 6), was an excellent piece on our 
water crisis. But for all the worthwhile tips on saving water, it overlooked an 
extremely important area. 
</P>
<P>
The great bulk of California's water is not being used up or thrown away in our 
daily drinking and bathing habits. It's going into our animal agriculture 
industry. Take these items from John Robbin's "Diet for a New America:" 
</P>
<P>
Water needed to produce a pound of wheat: 25 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Water needed to produce a pound of meat: 2,500 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
That's because pound after pound of grain has to be raised and converted into 
livestock feed before we get any of it back as meat from the butcher. 
</P>
<P>
Moral: You want to save water? Cut back on eating meat.

THE CHURCH'S VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can it be that the Catholic Church has its left foot in its mouth and the right 
foot doesn't know? View on June 6 makes one wonder. The reporting of two rites 
of passage -- the Latino quinceanera and high society's coming out -- reflects 
opposing church attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
We read that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles has issued new guidelines for 
quinceaneras to simplify a tradition that has ". . . become too secular, too 
social and too costly" ("Is the Party Over?" Page 1). 
</P>
<P>
On another page of the same issue, we read that in a ballroom of the Beverly 
Hilton Hotel there was "no shortage of pomp" as this year's designer-clad 
(Social Services Auxiliary) debutantes were presented to the Archbishop of Los 
Angeles ("On View"). 
</P>
<P>
If there is an award for ambivalence, I hereby nominate the Catholic Church.

HEAVY METAL GROUPS STRIKE A SOUR CHORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the L.A. metal scene lacks a discussion of perhaps the 
furthest-reaching, terrible contribution of the metal culture, namely 
pay-to-play. Bob Sipchen mentions most club owners' practice of making bands 
pay before granting them stage time, but fails to explain that if it were not 
for those metal bands that will pay, the arrangement would not exist. 
</P>
<P>
As a local alternative/punk fanzine editor, I am constantly made aware of the 
problems of this peculiarly Los Angeles institution. I hear of $200 spent for a 
15-minute slot before an audience of 30. 
</P>
<P>
All over Southern California, bands with principle are uniting to protest and 
refuse to participate in this unjust system. Bands of this sort have few places 
to play as more and more clubs, knowing they can get the metal bands to pay 
them, turn to pay-to-play.

HEAVY METAL GROUPS STRIKE A SOUR CHORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article by Bob Sipchen on Hollywood's heavy metal nightclub scene really 
hit home ("Rock City," June 8). 
</P>
<P>
I used to head out to Sunset Boulevard every weekend to catch the latest bands, 
but that was several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I stopped because I got tired of seeing either of the following: dimwitted 
"death metal" basket cases who play fast merely for the sake of playing fast 
with no regard for emotion save blind rage, or oversexed playboys who spend 
more time moussing their hair and searching for groupies than putting any 
thought behind their music. It all added up to self-serving, meaningless 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Sipchen's article has proven to me that nothing has changed. Los Angeles metal 
is suffering musically because the musicians and club-goers who pack Hollywood 
on any given night aren't there to change the direction of rock and roll, but 
to fulfill their pipe dreams of either being famous or knowing someone who is. 
That's why great bands like Soundgarden and Faith No More are coming from 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder no one takes heavy metal music seriously.

AT HOME: HOUSES CHANGE BUT NEIGHBORS DON'T; 
</P>
<P>
WESTDALE: REMODELING AND RENOVATION IS WIDESPREAD IN THIS COMMUNITY THAT HAS 
3,500 HOMEOWNERS AND 500 ARE ORIGINAL OWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER W. LINDEN, Linden is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty years ago, when Roz and Seymour Bessen were combing Los Angeles for the 
best place to raise their two children, they discovered Westdale, tucked among 
West Los Angeles, Palms, Mar Vista and Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"We especially loved the park, where lots of mommies would take their kids," 
Roz Bessen said. Except for the fact that maids have taken over for mommies, 
not much has changed in Westdale, she said. "It's still Small Town, U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
"One reason I stay in this big, old house that I don't need anymore is that I 
can walk to the corner stores, get my hair done and run into people I know 
along the way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Westdale residents share those feelings about their community, which is 
roughly bounded on the north by Gateway Boulevard, on the south by Palms 
Boulevard, on the east by Sawtelle Boulevard and the west by Bundy Drive, 
according to realtor Ron Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
That's what brought Emil and Hanna Reisler's house hunt to a close last 
September. After polling residents in every neighborhood where they would 
consider buying, the Reislers found Westdale to be the most stable. 
</P>
<P>
"The people always spoke of the strong sense of community and how they wouldn't 
want to move," Emil Reisler said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bessens and Reislers live in Trousdale, an upscale section of Westdale that 
was settled in 1947, after the construction of 450 single-story tract homes 
developed by Paul Trousdale. Since then, two additional tracts have been built, 
bringing the number of homes to more than 900. 
</P>
<P>
While many Westdale residents stay put, the houses change. Remodeling and 
renovation is widespread. According to Steph DeVault of Fred Sands Realtors, 
few homes remain in their original state. 
</P>
<P>
"Where it was once the trend to expand by building porches and larger master 
bedrooms, now, people are building big second stories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A decade after founding his original tract, Trousdale established the luxurious 
Trousdale Estates neighborhood in Beverly Hills. As Trousdale's distinction 
soared, so did home prices in his Westdale community. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn, owner of Wynn Realtors, said a typical 1,400-square foot, three-bedroom, 
single-story home that cost $13,000 when the tract was first built now sells 
for $525,000. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Westdale residents choosing to sell their homes reap plentiful 
profits. Many of them, however, opt to stay put. According to Wynn, about 500 
of the community's 3,500 homeowners are original owners, and 1,500 have lived 
there at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, Bill and Teddy Murrish paid almost $20,000 for their three-bedroom, 
2,000-square foot home -- a price they considered well beyond their budget. "We 
knew it was way too much money, we had no business buying it," Teddy Murrish 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of many Westdale buyers, however, the Murrishes were willing to extend 
their budget for the community's high quality of life. "We looked everywhere. 
This was the quietest area, the schools were good, and the people were just 
great," Murrish said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Murrishes have retired, their children have left home, they 
have renovated several rooms and have no plans to sell their home. 
</P>
<P>
But not all Westdale buyers are as indifferent to their home's profit potential 
as the Murrishes. Mark Perry, a commercial real estate broker, who, with his 
wife, Camille, is now preparing to move to Trousdale, says his attraction to 
the area was primarily profit-related. 
</P>
<P>
After surveying Mar Vista and other neighboring communities, Perry found 
Westdale superior in terms of the quality and upkeep of its homes as well as 
its tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
These factors meant future profit to Perry. Not only was the $520,000 home he 
found within his budget, but more important, from his point of view, the area 
has potential for ample appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
"Buying and selling to make money is the nature of the beast of my business," 
he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Westdale's pride of ownership, residents often remark on its 
accessibility and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
Within walking distance of Westdale are the Mar Vista Elementary School and the 
Mar Vista Park. The school is a popular plus among buyers with children, and 
the park is relished by young and old alike. 
</P>
<P>
Classes offered by the Recreation Center, on park grounds, bring a year-round 
flurry of activity. On a typical spring day, for instance, T-ball, five-pitch 
and Little League players dominate the baseball diamonds, while their siblings, 
parents and grandparents take part in classes ranging from ballet to badminton. 
</P>
<P>
Although the residents are a diverse group, their shared interest in Westdale's 
welfare brings them together for homeowners' activities. The 40-year-old 
Westdale Homeowners Assn. is organizing its own neighborhood earthquake relief 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Association president Natalie Fisher recently played host to an earthquake 
preparedness meeting for her block. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed what to do in case the 'big one' hit -- who can do what, who the 
doctors are, who has children, who is disabled, as well as exchanging 
addresses, phone numbers and emergency numbers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those residents who cannot attend earthquake meetings or any of the homeowners' 
gatherings, keep informed by the "Westdale Villager," the association's 
quarterly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Other association activities include helping to enforce Westdale's strict 
codes, covenants and restrictions. Currently, the homeowners are petitioning to 
prevent apartment buildings on Sawtelle Boulevard from exceeding the 35-foot 
height limit. 
</P>
<P>
Another hot issue among Westdale residents and their neighbors is noise 
generated by the Santa Monica Airport, about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last 15 years, area residents have complained of air traffic and how 
it interferes with their community," said Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin 
Braude, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
Although talks with the Federal Aviation Administration have resulted in 
restrictions as to the types of aircraft allowed to land, Braude is not 
optimistic about any further relief. "There's no evidence that the government 
will change its posture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides uniting on political issues, Westdale residents also band together to 
promote safety on their streets. 
</P>
<P>
Although a police car roams Westdale during its 24-hour route through all 
neighborhoods located west of the San Diego Freeway and south of the Santa 
Monica Freeway, the residents prefer exclusive scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
For this, they hire a security patrol service to canvass their streets for 17 
hours each day and to be especially watchful of their homes when they're out of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Westdale residents are proud of the fact that crime on their streets is 
relatively low. Tony Davis, an officer with the Police Department's Pacific 
Division, said Westdale has much lower crime rate than neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Incidents there are very few," he said. "Probably its most common crime is 
theft from vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Guberman grew up in Westdale and later returned to live there as an 
adult. She now finds herself being torn away from her hometown for a move to 
Napa Valley with her company. 
</P>
<P>
Although Guberman expects to make a hefty profit on her home, she regrets 
having to uproot her family from the familiar community she calls "quiet, 
friendly and within 10 minutes of everything." 
</P>
<P>
Newcomer Christine Beilinson understands Guberman's sadness over having to 
move. After just two years in Westdale, Beilinson says emphatically, "I'd like 
to build a second story on our home and live here forever."

HUSBAND IS LIABLE FOR EX-WIFE'S DEFAULT OF VA MORTGAGE ON HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My wife and I were divorced about four years ago. She got the house 
with its VA mortgage. Shortly after the divorce she became unemployed and quit 
paying on the mortgage. She lived in the house almost a year before the VA 
foreclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Then she filed bankruptcy to stall the foreclosure sale. Finally, the VA 
foreclosed and my ex-wife was kicked out of the house. The VA says they lost 
about $4,500 after they eventually found a buyer for the house. Now the VA 
wants me to pay for their loss. Can they do this to me? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes. Unless you were released of liability on the VA mortgage at the 
time of your divorce, you remained liable to the VA for any loss upon 
foreclosure of the house. Please consult a real estate attorney for further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lender Should Send Papers If Loan Paid 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last month, I made the final payment on my home loan. I attached a short 
letter explaining this was the last payment, and I wanted the loan removed from 
the property records. So far, I have heard nothing from the lender. I have 
tried phoning the lender but their toll-free number is constantly busy. Should 
I require proof the loan has been removed from the property? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. If the loan security was a mortgage, the lender should record a 
"Satisfaction of Mortgage." When a deed of trust is used to secure the loan 
repayment, then a "Deed of Reconveyance" should be recorded by the lender and 
forwarded to you. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many lenders fail to promptly record these documents. Why? 
Because there is no financial incentive for the lender to complete this paper 
work if there is other work to be done. Don't give up. Keep pressing the lender 
to record the proper document and send it to you promptly. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Real Estate Career Not All Milk and Honey 
</P>
<P>
Q: From time to time you encourage people to become real estate salespeople. 
That's a bunch of baloney. Selling real estate is the worst job there is. 
</P>
<P>
I tried it for eight months and only grossed about $19,000. Out of that I had 
to pay my auto expenses, health insurance, income taxes, Social Security tax 
and other business expenses. I figure I was lucky to net about $1,500 per month 
for working at least 60 hours per week and often seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
At the Christmas party, after a few drinks, my broker told one of the guests 
she earns over $200,000 per year. But we peasant salespeople are practically 
starving. Isn't it about time you wise up and tell the truth about what a lousy 
job selling real estate really is? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'm sorry you were not successful selling real estate. But at least you 
tried, and now you know it is not what you enjoy. However, most real estate 
salespeople enjoy their work very much. If that were not true, the National 
Assn. of Realtors would not be the nation's largest trade association with over 
700,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, selling real estate is hard work. The most successful realty agents are 
amply rewarded, often earning more than $100,000 per year. The top salespeople 
earn more than $200,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Selling real estate is one of the few jobs where there is no limit to how much 
a person can earn and where salespeople can work as hard or as little as they 
wish. Unfortunately, getting started in real estate sales is not easy, as you 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assert Easement Rights Before Losing Them 
</P>
<P>
Q: For the last 25 years I have had a flower garden on what is part of my 
neighbor's land. There have been several owners of that property over the years 
and none objected to my garden. But the current owner says he is going to build 
a fence and enclose my garden in his property. I recall a long time ago you 
wrote about prescriptive easements. Does my situation qualify? 
</P>
<P>
A: A prescriptive easement across part of your neighbor's property can be 
acquired by open, notorious, hostile and continuous use of part of your 
neighbor's property for the number of years required by state law. These 
elements are the same as for acquiring title to property by adverse possession 
except you do not have to pay the property taxes on the neighbor's property as 
is required for adverse possession. 
</P>
<P>
It appears you have met all the elements of a prescriptive easement. I suggest 
you contact a real estate attorney about filing a lawsuit to perfect your 
prescriptive easement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gift Property Basis Is Same as Donor's Basis 
</P>
<P>
Q: About 20 years ago, my mother gave me her house when she moved to a 
retirement home. Recently she died. I am thinking of selling the house, which 
has greatly appreciated in market value over the 20 years. Would I have to pay 
any profit tax if I sell? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. When a property gift is received, the recipient takes over the donor's 
basis in the property. For example, let's suppose your late mother paid $20,000 
for the house, it was worth $50,000 when you received it as a gift, and it is 
now worth $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since your basis is your donor mother's $20,000 basis, if you sell the house 
for a net sales price of $100,000, you will have an $80,000 capital gain. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the house is your principal residence, then you can use the 
"roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034 to defer 
your profit tax by purchasing a replacement home of equal or greater cost 
within 24 months before or after the sale. Please ask your tax adviser to 
explain further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Consequences of Move to Cheaper Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband just got a big job promotion. The bad news is that we will be 
selling our home for about $280,000 and moving to a small town where we can buy 
a much nicer and larger home for around $130,000. As we are not yet age 55, is 
there any way we can avoid paying tax on our sale profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: Internal Revenue Code 1034, the "roll-over residence replacement rule," says 
the seller of a principal residence must defer the profit tax if a replacement 
principal residence of equal or greater cost is purchased within 24 months 
before or after the sale. However, if a less expensive replacement home is 
bought, the profit is taxable up to the difference in the two prices. 
</P>
<P>
However, any capital improvements, such as landscaping, remodeling, swimming 
pool and room additions, added to the replacement home within the 24-month 
replacement period will raise the replacement home's cost and reduce your 
taxable profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Capital Gain Taxes on Sales After Death 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife is 68 and I am 73, so we are thinking of retiring in the next few 
years. We were talking with our tax man about possibly selling our real estate 
investments, including our home. 
</P>
<P>
We have large profits and are thinking about carrying back mortgages for 
retirement income. But then he told us something I found hard to believe. He 
said if we sell our properties, we will have to pay tax on our sale profits, 
but if we die still owning our properties there is no tax on our capital gain. 
True or false? 
</P>
<P>
A: True. When a person dies, there is no capital gain tax to be paid. Death is 
the ultimate tax shelter. However, the deceased's assets are subject to federal 
estate tax. But assets left to a surviving spouse qualify for the marital 
estate tax exemption. There is also a $600,000 estate tax exemption. 
</P>
<P>
If you need retirement income, selling your properties on installment sales and 
carrying back the mortgage financing is an excellent idea. In addition to the 
income benefits, by offering easy financing you can get top dollar and quick 
results when selling your properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Labor on Investments Can't Be Deducted 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own an apartment building which needs considerable remodeling. I am a 
firefighter, I have considerable time off during which I can do the work. 
However, several of my fellow fire fighters who also own real estate investment 
properties tell me I cannot deduct the value of my labor on my own property. 
Please tell me this isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, your friends are correct. The value of your personal labor on your 
own investment property is not tax-deductible. However, the cost of materials 
can be added to your adjusted cost basis for the property and depreciated over 
27.5 years. Please consult your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carrying Out-of-Area Mortgage Is OK 
</P>
<P>
Q: Due to a job transfer we will be selling our home and moving out of state. 
The market for home sales is slow in our town now. The real estate agent 
suggests we carry back a second mortgage, so the buyer can assume our VA first 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
We will get enough cash from the buyer's down payment, so we can afford to buy 
a home in our new town. However, we are concerned about the problems we might 
have if the buyer doesn't make the monthly payments on time. If you were in our 
situation would you carry back a second mortgage, knowing you will be moving 
out of town? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Millions of mortgage payments are made to out-of-town lenders every 
month. Less than 1% of those loans ever go into default. However, the best 
thing that could happen to you if your buyer defaults, you foreclose and get 
the house back to sell again for a second profit. But don't get your hopes up 
because that rarely happens. If you should have to foreclose, just turn the 
matter over to a local real estate lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who's Responsible for Fence in Wrong Site? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last year we bought our first home. The seller pointed out the fence on one 
boundary is about three feet on the neighbor's side of the property line, but 
it had been there when our seller bought the house, so he didn't think it would 
cause any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In April the neighbor said he wants us to remove "our fence" from his property. 
Since the fence is on his side of the property, it seems to us and our lawyer 
it is not our job to remove the fence. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Since the fence is located on your neighbor's property, you would be 
trespassing if you remove it. The fence belongs to your neighbor, so if he 
wants it removed it is up to him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is Duplex a Better Buy Than a House? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Instead of buying a single-family house I am considering buying a two-family 
duplex where I would live in half rent the other half to a tenant. Do you think 
this is a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The market value appreciation of duplexes is usually less than for 
nearby single-family houses. Another problem is you may not want to live so 
close to your tenants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easement Must Be in Writing to Be Valid 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently bought some rural land where I hope to build a vacation home this 
summer. When I was staking out the lot for grading, a neighbor informed me he 
has an easement across my lot to get to his adjoining property. There is 
nothing in my deed about this. I checked with the seller and she says there is 
no easement. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Ask the neighbor for his proof of the easement. To be a valid easement, it 
must be in writing unless the neighbor has met all the conditions for a 
prescriptive easement. If the easement proof appears to be valid, consult the 
title insurance company that insured your deed. You did buy an owner's title 
policy, didn't you? 
</P>

REAL ESTATE BLAMED FOR PHOENIX'S FINANCIAL WOES;

ARIZONA: HIGH COMMERCIAL VACANCIES, LAND SPECULATION, BANKRUPTCIES AND 
FORECLOSURES DEAL HEAVY BLOW TO CAPITAL'S ECONOMY.

PHOENIX 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Color it yellow for the bright desert sun, add a touch of brown for the rich 
earthen tones of real estate. What do you have on the color wheel? A light, 
pleasant brown? 
</P>
<P>
For this "Cinderella" city of the postwar Southwest, unfortunately, the mixture 
has emerged as plain, unadulterated mud. 
</P>
<P>
While much of the negative publicity that Phoenix has received since its bubble 
burst in 1987 has centered on its collapsing financial institutions, the major 
villain lurking in the background has been the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years real estate has been the sword that Phoenix lived by 
and, occasionally, died by. 
</P>
<P>
Maricopa County, of which Phoenix is the hub, has ballooned from 106,000 
residents in 1950 to 2 million today, and has attracted such high-tech 
manufacturers as Itel, Motorola and McDonnell Douglas Helicopters. And such 
Fortune 500 companies as Greyhound and Phelps Dodge have chosen to move their 
corporate headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
The principal lure? Cheap and endless real estate, and outside investors 
willing to pour billions into ventures that in colder, more conservative 
climes, would have been considered wildly speculative. 
</P>
<P>
In-state financial institutions -- for the most part captained by Arizona 
natives who prided themselves on sealing multimillion-dollar deals with a 
handshake -- were in the wings, willing to take up any slack. 
</P>
<P>
The gung-ho, shoot-from-the-hip style has never been without its downside risks 
though. 
</P>
<P>
"After extraordinary growth in the early 1960s, everything went sour and we had 
record vacancies -- as many as 20% of the apartment developments in some 
areas," said Jay G. Butler, director of Arizona State University's Real Estate 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We had most of the elements then that we have now -- in particular, a lot of 
land speculation. John Long (a pioneer Phoenix home builder who, since the 
1950s has constructed an estimated 35,000 homes in the area) had 1,000 unsold 
homes sitting out there at one time." 
</P>
<P>
And in both 1975 and 1982, Butler said, similar booms and busts occurred. "They 
were very sharp on both the downside and the upside -- V-shaped. This current 
decline may still have a way to go on the downside, and the pull-out may be 
slower." 
</P>
<P>
With such a boom-bust history, what happened in the mid-1980s that caused 
Phoenix developers and investors to embark on the speculative frenzy leading to 
today's problems? 
</P>
<P>
Problems which, almost two years after the collapse, still haunt Phoenix: 
vacancies in industrial real estate hovering at 22.7% -- from a low of 10.4% in 
distribution space to as high as 45% in high-tech research and development real 
estate -- and vacancies of about 17% in apartments and 27% in office space, 
according to Don Morrow, senior marketing consultant for the Phoenix office of 
Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Fogging memories of past busts, local experts say, was a sudden, explosive 
growth in the area that even by bigger-than-life Phoenix standards, was 
extraordinary: besides the nation-leading 8.2% in job growth in '85, 
construction employment alone soared 74.5% between 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Also, new and even more aggressive players were entering the ballgame, as 
personified by Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Through his Phoenix-based American Continental Corp., which he converted from a 
traditional home construction company into a high-flying financial-services 
company, Keating, in 1984, used the local company to buy Irvine-based Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
And immediately he began using Lincoln's federally insured deposits for 
everything from land speculation and real estate to junk bonds, LBO financings 
and futures speculation, federal regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
In all, regulators say, Lincoln provided about 90% of American's assets and 
revenues until the S&amp;L was seized and put under the Resolution Trust Corp. 
umbrella in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And, of the estimated $2 billion that taxpayers stand to lose on the Lincoln 
Savings deal, about $1 billion of it is in land acquisitions, development and 
construction loans, and another $900 million is in indirect real estate 
investments in the form of raw land acquired for development and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Where? In the already hurting Phoenix real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's most ambitious project was the grandiose Estrella master-planned 
community in the desert, about 45 miles southwest of downtown Phoenix -- a 
20,000-acre tract that was to house a community of 200,000 residents, several 
golf courses, an office park, a 400-room resort hotel, schools, shopping malls 
and a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The up-front money for sweeping, four-lane roads lined with palm trees, a 
bridge over a desert wash, grades, street lights, a community center and two 
lakes encompassing 75 acres was estimated, conservatively, local real estate 
observers say, at $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
Estrella, today under the control of the RTC, is a pleasant, but lonely drive 
into the quiet desert. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly hung out to dry are the vast holdings of Burns International Inc., 
headed up by 36-year-old Robert Burns, an aggressive Phoenix developer. His 
most ambitious project, Sun Valley, bears a striking resemblance to Keating's 
Estrella development. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley is about 45 miles west of downtown Phoenix, and is a 28,000-acre 
master-planned community of which Burns owns or controls 23,100 acres, and 95 
other property owners control the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty of the 95, including Burns, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
petitions in early February to protect their land from reverting to Heron 
International of London, Burns' financial partner in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
Heron had guaranteed $82 million in bonds that the landowners used to finance 
Sun Valley Parkway, a four-lane, 30-mile road that connects with Interstate 10 
on the south and sweeps grandly through what was to be the heart of the 
planned-community. 
</P>
<P>
A highway sign at the eastern junction of Interstate 10 and the lonely Sun 
Valley Parkway says it all: "No Services Next 35 Miles." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the current collapse of the real estate market, experts here are 
reluctant to lump Phoenix in with Dallas, Houston and Denver -- cities with 
similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Dallas and Houston have more vacant office space than Phoenix has total 
office space," said Don Morrow, senior marketing consultant for the Phoenix 
office of Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, we absorbed about 1.8 million square feet of office space. That's an 
absorption rate of more than 5% and in the same period, Los Angeles absorbed 
about 6% of its space. If we return to the same growth that we had before this 
happened, about 4% -- which isn't an unreasonable target -- that vacancy factor 
will be cut in half in two years." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are disturbing blobs of real estate fat around Phoenix's midriff 
that seem to defy current belt-tightening efforts. 
</P>
<P>
An example, according to Ralph E. Kammrath, a real estate consultant here, is 
in shopping center construction, which is booming along with 8 million square 
feet of new space in the works -- 50% more than was under construction a year 
earlier and five times the space that Kammrath estimates is needed in a single 
year to satisfy normal demands. 
</P>
<P>
The current vacancy rate for retail space, he said, is about 16.19%, rising to 
18.45% by this October and to 20.13% by October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Also showing no abatement, according to Ralph Shattuck, publisher of 
Foreclosure Update Newsletter, are real estate properties being reclaimed by 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year," he said, "foreclosures in Maricopa County totaled $4.4 billion -- 
up from $3.3 billion in 1988. About $1 billion of last year's foreclosures were 
on residential property, the rest was commercial. And in January of this year, 
an additional $439 million in foreclosures were exercised, with about $104 
million of that in residential." 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances -- such as pre-bust 1985 and 1986 -- Shattuck added, 
Phoenix averages 600 to 700 residential foreclosures a month. "And we're seeing 
more than twice that at the present. And commercial, of course, is an entirely 
different world -- five years ago we were seeing maybe $50 million a month in 
foreclosures. Now look at January with about $335 million in foreclosures." 
</P>
<P>
The foreclosure figures notwithstanding, both Shattuck and R. L. Brown of Home 
Builders Marketing Inc., another Phoenix real estate research firm, agree that 
the single-family home situation here is considerably brighter than it looks on 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got about 600,000 single-family homes here and the lenders are holding 
about 2,500 to 3,500 of them, FHA has another 3,000 and HUD has fewer than 
1,000," Shattuck said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not all that many houses sitting empty because of foreclosure. And, (in 
January) we had 873 new homes sold and 2,329 resales -- that's about 12,000 
sales a quarter, which gives us about a three-month surplus. Which, all things 
considered, isn't all that bad." 
</P>
<P>
And Brown added: 
</P>
<P>
"There's been very, very little serious price-cutting here in the residential 
market, except in older, run-down houses and in the condo market. Condos died 
out here back in 1981 and 1982 -- long before these troubles hit us." 
</P>
<P>
The current slump, he said, has reduced the number of new houses coming on the 
market to 12,311 in 1989 and a projected 13,500 this year from the normal, 
non-boom average of 15,000 to 17,000. 
</P>
<P>
The number of home builders has also dwindled from about 73 putting up 50 or 
more homes a year in 1986 to about 46 today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're expecting a gradual increase in new housing to about 18,000 to 18,500 a 
year by the mid-'90s," Brown said, "but we certainly don't expect anything near 
the record 22,000 that were built at the peak in '86. That was a real 
aberration." 
</P>
<P>
One of the bright spots that Phoenix real estate experts see in the area's 
present slump is that the opportunities are attracting outside investors. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially Californians," Grubb &amp; Ellis' Morrow said. "It's frequently 
quicker to get from Phoenix to Los Angeles (by air) than it is to get from one 
end of L.A. County to the other." 
</P>
<P>
With this distribution-hub advantage as its teaser, Grubb &amp; Ellis, in the 
final months of 1989, took a three-hour film presentation on the road to 
capacity audiences in Orange County, Los Angeles and San Francisco. By the end 
of the year, it had chalked up $36.5 million in commercial sales to 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"In the South Los Angeles basin area," Morrow said, "a developer is looking for 
distribution buildings with a replacement cost of $55 to $65 a foot and returns 
of 7 1/2% to 8 1/2%. We've just placed three sales in escrow here at costs 
under $25 a foot and returns of 9 3/4%. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment units, according to the most recent study by researcher Kammrath, 
have dropped in price to the lowest level in the last decade -- to $24,068 a 
unit in 1989, an 18.5% plunge from the decade high of $29,517 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
And in the office building market, the RTC announced in February the sale of 
the Biltmore Commerce Center on Camelback Road to Shurl Curci, chairman of the 
Transpacific Development Co. of Torrance, for $26 million. The 
250,000-square-foot structure was built for $35 million five years ago and was 
listed by the RTC late last year at $29 million. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming a return to more reasonable growth rates of 4% to 5% in Phoenix, ASU's 
real estate expert Butler said the area should be much improved within two to 
three years (the optimistic assessment) to five years (the pessimistic). 
</P>
<P>
The one exception: raw land around the periphery of Phoenix, which, developers 
and bankers agree, will remain a drag for years to come. Some acreage, flipped 
up to $90,000 an acre, is now listed at $25,000, with no takers.

AMERICA'S HOUSING: WASHINGTON / CATHERINE COLLINS; 
</P>
<P>
REALTORS' LOAN SERVICE FEES STIR CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, Collins, a veteran real estate reporter, writes from 
Washington on housing-related issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The enticements that some mortgage lenders will offer realtors as incentives to 
recommend their loans to home buyers vary -- money, televisions, even 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
One lender offered this "realtor vacation package": 
</P>
<P>
"Visit Sea World on us. For every loan closed, you will receive a paid vacation 
for two to San Antonio. This will include air fare via Southwest Airlines, 
lodgings at the Wyndham Hotel and day passes to Sea World. For each loan closed 
your name will be re-entered into our Grand Prize vacation drawing to the 
romantic city of San Francisco. Call us. Shamu is waiting." 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a great little perquisite, but the problem is that under federal 
law it is illegal for a realtor to take money for lender referrals. 
</P>
<P>
The practice violates the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act (RESPA). 
The law was passed in 1974 because referral fees paid by mortgage lenders to 
realtors -- kickbacks -- were so common that they were driving up consumer 
costs, the Mortgage Bankers Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
"Realtors do not typically collect referral fees, but if they do, they should 
be prosecuted to the full extent of the law," said Norman Flynn, president of 
the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
There is little argument here. The realtors, mortgage bankers, consumer groups, 
members of Congress and Department of Housing and Urban Development are all 
similarly opposed to old-fashioned referral fees. 
</P>
<P>
But they disagree vehemently over the latest twist that one-stop shopping has 
brought to the real estate business: Some realtors now take loan applications 
and charge for that service. 
</P>
<P>
The battle lines have been drawn: It's the realtors against everyone else, 
which may be the reason for some of the histrionics. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent realtor-sponsored conference, one realtor said, "Forgo innovation, 
forgo your birthright." 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage bankers want the RESPA legislation amended to prohibit loan processing 
by realtors. Realtors want the law left alone. Each side claims to represent 
the consumer in this debate. 
</P>
<P>
But self-interest is oiling the machinery of this inter-industry war. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage bankers and consumer groups say the realtors are using a "loophole" in 
RESPA. The regulation that prohibits lenders paying realtors for referrals is 
no longer an issue because it is the consumer who now pays the tab. 
</P>
<P>
And although the law says that realtors cannot receive a fee for a simple 
referral, they now provide a service -- filling out the application. 
</P>
<P>
But the mortgage bankers ask how realtors can avoid the conflict of being paid 
by both the seller, who pays the realtor's commission, and the buyer, who pays 
for the help with the loan application. 
</P>
<P>
"To give clear and impartial direction to the borrower, there must be a 
separation of powers and duties," said Angelo Mozilo, president of Countrywide 
Funding Corp., a mortgage banker in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the lender, the appraiser, even the termite inspector. If the real 
estate broker is receiving remuneration from any of those entities involved in 
the process, he can't be impartial." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers Union backs the mortgage bankers. Michelle Meier, counsel for 
government affairs at the consumer group, said: 
</P>
<P>
"The work involved is so minimal and problematic that I don't consider it a 
bona fide service. But the biggest problem for the consumer is that he relies 
heavily on his real estate broker for an objective opinion. Unfortunately, when 
the real estate broker has a financial stake in what lender is chosen, the 
consumer is not going to get impartial advice." 
</P>
<P>
Citing a HUD study, Meier said almost half of all consumers choose a lender 
recommended by their agent. 
</P>
<P>
However, realtors are saying that they have every right to be compensated for 
services rendered. 
</P>
<P>
"Mortgage bankers are asking for a federal law to fence themselves in, to keep 
out competition from other sources," Flynn said. "They keep trying to wrap 
themselves in the pro-consumer shroud, but to put false barriers in the 
marketplace would be detrimental to consumers." 
</P>
<P>
The heated conflict between mortgage bankers and realtors has arisen largely 
because the biggest mortgage banking company in the country, Citicorp, uses 
realtors as loan processors. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to increase customer service and speed up the loan process, 
Citicorp tested a computer loan application program in New York in the early 
1980s. Although it also was available to lawyers, mortgage bankers and 
accountants, it was mostly realtors who signed up for membership in the program 
so they could provide an extra service for their customers. 
</P>
<P>
The program was a big success and the financial company expanded it nationwide 
in 1985, said Bob Horner, the chairman of Citicorp Mortgage Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't long before realtors found themselves also running the program 
for would-be buyers who were not their customers, too. And they began to charge 
for the service. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp has never paid realtors who use its program for loan applications. In 
fact, its members pay Citicorp between $1,000 and $2,500 a year, depending on 
size, for access to the computer program. Not all realtor-members charge 
clients for the service, and among those who do, fees vary greatly -- from $100 
to two percentage points of the loan balance. 
</P>
<P>
Horner is no apologist for the program. Citicorp's background credit check 
would prevent any realtor from greasing the skids for an unqualified buyer, he 
said. Horner is tired, he lamented, of what he calls the deliberate and 
misleading portrayal of Citicorp's highly successful program. 
</P>
<P>
"We violently oppose referral fees," he said, "and Citicorp has never paid a 
realtor for a loan application." 
</P>
<P>
HUD is in a quandary. Twice the federal housing agency has issued informal 
opinions saying it was permissible for realtors to charge extra fees for these 
services. Recently, however, HUD drafted a regulation to limit the practice, 
but it was never signed because the outgoing secretary, Samuel L. Pierce, 
thought it should be left for his successor, Jack Kemp, according to the 
Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Hearings scheduled on the subject for early June before the House subcommittee 
for housing and community development were canceled. Pressure dealing with the 
first omnibus housing bill in more than 10 years was to blame for the 
postponement, according to a panel staff member, who said the hearings will be 
held eventually. 
</P>
<P>
If the staffer's assessment is a good indicator, the realtors may have a tough 
time of it before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a real estate broker," said the staffer, "and I've got to close a 
deal to earn my commission, naturally it is in my best interests to qualify the 
home buyer for a loan. That's what real estate brokers help to do. There's 
nothing new. I ought to be thankful if there is a new computer program out 
there that enables me to do my job more expeditiously. Hell, I should be 
willing to charge less." 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena, Walden Woods and the New Orleans French Quarter have been 
placed on the "most endangered places" list by the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"Preservation of significant cultural landmarks is essential if Americans are 
to have a sense of identity and place," said J. Jackson Walter, president of 
the trust. 
</P>
<P>
The list is part of the organization's support for cultural legislation to 
protect sites from development pressure, vandalism and the scarcity of money 
for maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Besides South Pasadena and the other two locations, this year's list named 
Antietam National Battlefield Park, Md.; Columbus Landing Site in the Virgin 
Islands; Deadwood Historic District, S.D.; Fort Frederica National Monument, 
Ga.; Kennecott Mines, Alaska; Penn School, S.C.; Roycroft Inn, N.Y., and West 
Mesa petroglyphs, N.M.

HOME IMPROVEMENT;

<P>
MAKE YOUR OWN BED WITH PLYWOOD SHEETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A.J. HAND, (c) 1990, Los Angeles Times Syndicate 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you were lucky, your mother taught you how to make your bed. If not, it was 
your drill sergeant. Be that as it may, I'm going to teach you all over again. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm not talking about hospital corners and bouncing quarters. I'm talking 
about making a bed -- with wood, glue, screws and nails. 
</P>
<P>
It's a very simple project, really -- little more than a simple plywood box 
with the sleeping platform set down two inches into the frame. You can make it 
in any size to fit any mattress. In fact, it's best to buy your mattress first, 
then size the bed to fit. That's why I haven't supplied any dimensions in the 
sketch. 
</P>
<P>
Start by cutting out the sides and ends. Make them 20 inches high, unless you 
prefer a bed higher or lower than normal. Cut the end pieces about an inch 
longer than the width of your mattress, and make the sides about an inch longer 
than the length of the mattress. 
</P>
<P>
Material? Your best bet probably is birch plywood. It takes paint well, and 
also looks good -- stained or unstained -- under a varnish finish. It's also 
smoother and more uniform than ordinary fir plywood. 
</P>
<P>
For the framework, use ordinary fir 2-by-3s. But sort through the pile to get 
the straightest pieces you can find. Start the frame by cutting out four corner 
posts, and two center posts, each 14 1/2inches long. Using 1 1/2-inch flat-head 
screws and yellow glue, fasten these posts to the sides and ends. Drive the 
screws through the plywood into the frame, countersinking the heads below 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Note the corner detail in the sketch. The ends and sides do not overlap each 
other. They join corner to corner, creating a pocket. Later you'll fill this 
pocket with a quarter round molding, giving the bed nice soft corners. 
</P>
<P>
After the corner posts are in place, glue and screw in the center posts. Center 
these end to end on the side panels. Next, cut a center cross brace, the same 
length as your end panels. Place this on edge atop the center posts and secure 
it with a pair of screws, through the sides of the bed at each end. 
</P>
<P>
Now finish off the framework, cutting the side and end rails to length, placing 
one edge atop the posts and securing them with glue and screws. 
</P>
<P>
You are now ready to cut and fit the sleeping platform. Unless you are making a 
single bed, you will have to cut the platform out of two sheets of plywood, 
running a seam directly over the center brace. You can use half-inch plywood 
for a single bed, but for larger beds, three-quarter-inch plywood will produce 
a stiffer surface. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the platform about a quarter inch undersize. This makes it easier to fit 
it. After the pieces are cut, lay them on top of the framework. Using a frame 
square, check to make sure that the bed is dead square. If it isn't, you can 
force it true without much effort. 
</P>
<P>
Once it it square, fasten the platform down with several screws driven into the 
frame. This will lock the bed rigidly in position and it won't be able to move 
out of square. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing up. Now you have to cover the top edges of the plywood. You can use 
iron or glue-on wood tape for this, but I like to use half-round moldings. Cut 
these the same length as your side and end panels and fasten them down using 
yellow glue and small finishing nails. Then cut four pieces of 
three-quarter-inch quarter round 20 1/2 inches long and glue and nail them into 
the corners of the bed as shown in the detail. Using a rasp, finish off the top 
ends of these quarter rounds so the blend in with the half-round moldings on 
the side and end panels. 
</P>
<P>
Fill over all screw and nail heads using wood dough or polyester auto body 
filler. Let set, then sand and finish. Your best bet is probably three or four 
coats of a good semi-gloss oil base enamel. Sand lightly between coats with 
220-grit paper. If you want a natural finish, use a good alkyd or polyurethane 
varnish instead of enamel. Stain before varnishing if you like.

HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: PULL-CORD BRUSH WILL SCRUB CREOSOTE AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: When I was installing a wood stove in my fireplace, I discovered the 
smoke chamber above the damper was covered with creosote. 
</P>
<P>
The damper opening is too small to reach up into this space from below. A 
chimney cleaning brush pushed down from above will not reach the area. Do you 
have any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: If you can't remove the damper plate (almost all damper plates can be 
removed or pushed aside once the handle is removed), then do the job with a 
"pull-cord chimney brush," which has a cord attached at its top and bottom. 
</P>
<P>
One person stands on the roof and, while holding one end of the cord, drops the 
brush down to a person by the fireplace hearth. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure to drop enough cord down so the brush is positioned in the smoke 
chamber. Then, alternately pull from the top and bottom to brush away the 
creosote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large Wall Crack Keeps Reappearing 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've repainted the plaster walls of my living room several times, filling a 
large crack that starts at the corner of a finished opening with joint 
compound. Shortly after each paint job, the crack reappears. How can I repair 
it permanently? 
</P>
<P>
A: The position of that crack is a sign that the framing is inadequate. The 
best solution would be to beef up the header or top plate of the bearing wall 
-- the sooner the better. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not prepared for such an extensive repair presently, chip out all 
loose plaster and clean the crack out thoroughly. Lay an ample bed of compound 
about 3 inches wide over the crack. 
</P>
<P>
Place wallboard tape down with a 4-inch taping knife, squeezing out the excess 
compound and making sure there are no air bubbles underneath the tape. When the 
compound dries (in a day or so), apply a second coat over the tape, feathering 
the edges flush with the wall surface. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fix Plasterboard Hole With 1-by-2s, Drywall 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a rather large plaster hole, about 4-by-4 inches in the plasterboard 
wall of our home. I want to repair it before repainting. Can I do it without 
replacing the entire panel? 
</P>
<P>
A: Cut a couple of 1-by-2x, about 6 inches long. Insert them through the hole 
and position them to create a fastening cleat against the back of the existing 
plasterboard. Use 1 1/4-inch drywall screws applied to the face of the 
plasterboard to mount the 1-by-2s parallel on opposite sides of the hole, 
leaving a three-quarter-inch-wide flat showing for each. then, cut a piece of 
drywall to fill the hole. Fasten it to the 1-by-2s with drywall screws. Tape 
and compound the seams to conceal the patch.

TIME TO READY POOL, HOT TUB FOR SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The warm summer months are closing in, so it may be time to think about getting 
the pool, spa or hot tub ready. Otherwise, it might be difficult to enjoy any 
of them if you are constantly fretting about maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't take much time or effort to get any of them in shape for the 
season, says Kirk Mitchell, chief chemist for Hydrotech Chemical Corp., a 
supplier of pool products. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell offered the following steps for preparing and maintaining pools, spas 
and hot tubs: 
</P>
<P>
Pools: "First and foremost, arm yourself with a test kit that has fresh 
reagents, or your readings could prove misleading," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
At the minimum, the kit should enable you to check the bromine or chlorine 
sanitizer, the pH and total alkalinity. It's also a good idea to equip your 
test kit to measure calcium hardness and acid and base demand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially at pool opening time, you should double-check your own findings by 
scooping up a 1-quart sample of water into a clean plastic container and taking 
it to your professional pool dealer for analysis," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
If the dealer's findings match yours, you're OK; if not, find out why the test 
results don't agree and make the necessary adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
If you aren't happy with your present sanitizing system because of an 
unpleasant odor or skin irritation, Mitchell suggested using brominated 
sanitizers that contain Chlorfree. 
</P>
<P>
"You're less likely to get either the smell or itching that sometimes results 
when chlorine combines with waste products to form contaminants known as 
chloramines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a good idea to "shock" the pool to make sure all organic wastes have 
been treated, Mitchell said. Traditionally, pool contaminants such as 
chloramines are treated by adding more chlorine, a process known as 
super-chlorination or break-point chlorination. 
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent algae growth, he recommended adding an algaecide. Since you 
must first injure algae or slime growth before you can kill it, Mitchell 
suggested that before applying any chemicals, you give the walls of the pool a 
good scrubbing with a strong brush. 
</P>
<P>
Hot tubs and spas: The first step involves determining the hot tub or spa's 
exact capacity so the right amount of chemicals are used, and getting a water 
test kit that measures bromine and pH level as well as for total alkalinity. 
</P>
<P>
Next comes the task of balancing five factors: the water's pH, total 
alkalinity, calcium hardness, temperature and total dissolved solids. The pH or 
acid-base balance should range from 7.4 to 8.0 
</P>
<P>
"Never should the pH go below 7.0 or above 8.4," said Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Should calcium hardness or total alkalinity get too high, he said, "Just drain 
part of the water and refill with fresh tap water, until tests show you've 
reached the manufacturer's recommended levels." 
</P>
<P>
For sanitizing, Mitchell believes bromine rather than chlorine-based products 
should be used because bromine works without imparting either the smell or skin 
and eye irritations commonly associated with chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
The actual dosage of bromine will vary depending on the size of the tub, but a 
general rule is to maintain a bromine residual of 2 to 4 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
One exception to that rule is with new hot tubs, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"A new hot tub will leach tannic acid and a natural wood component called 
lignin into the water, giving it a brown, murky look," he said. "This is 
expected, and should stop within six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, the bromine residual should be kept somewhat higher, at 3 to 
5 parts per million, and the water drained and refilled at least once a week 
until the leaching stops."

REMODELER'S DIARY: MEET A CONTRACTOR WHO DID EVERYTHING RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VALERIE J. NELSON, Nelson is the View/Calendar editor for the San Fernando 
Valley edition of the Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"How's the renovation going?" was the usual refrain from my co-workers and 
friends, who knew we were on an eight-week construction schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Just great," I told a friend in San Diego at the end of the first week, when 
the foundation had been poured and the new room framed. 
</P>
<P>
"Just wait," said the friend. "Something always goes wrong. My sister added on 
to her house, and she went $300,000 over budget. She finally had to quit her 
job to stem the damage." 
</P>
<P>
"Terrific," I told another woman who was in the middle of renovating her San 
Jose home, which she referred to as the Money Pit. 
</P>
<P>
"Just wait," she said, "It got so bad around here when they were sandblasting 
the ceilings that I had to escape with the baby to a motel for a couple of 
nights." 
</P>
<P>
"Just wait," said everybody else who asked me, seeming to sneer in unison at my 
naivete, "Something always goes wrong." 
</P>
<P>
No one wanted to believe that this was a contractor-client relationship that 
wouldn't turn into a horror story. 
</P>
<P>
We decided to add on to our two-bedroom, 1,260-square-foot house in south Van 
Nuys after backing out of buying a 2,000-square-foot home in Sherman Oaks. 
Moving would have meant twice the property taxes, probably another $10,000 just 
to make the Sherman Oaks house livable and almost double our present mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
So we joined the remodeling trend that seemed to be sweeping our neighborhood 
of 40-year-old homes. Adding on would give us the space we wanted, so we braced 
ourselves for a bad experience -- that was part of the deal, right? 
</P>
<P>
We almost lost faith in contractors before we began. From a dozen contacted, 
all found through friends and friends of friends, we could only get one guy to 
actually show up to look at the blueprints, and he was everything we'd been 
told a contractor would be -- arrogant and unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
He was hostile about the architect's blueprints, but promised to have a bid for 
us in a week. When I called after two weeks, he nearly hissed with resentment, 
but said he'd have the plans for us in another week. We never heard from him 
again. 
</P>
<P>
We came up with our contractor's name from an unlikely source, a neighbor down 
the street whom we had met once and to whom we had mentioned that we were 
having trouble finding a contractor. "Meet this guy," our neighbor said, "You 
will want to hire him." 
</P>
<P>
My husband left a message on the contractor's answering machine, and he 
returned the call the very next night. That was one good sign. 
</P>
<P>
As my husband, Steve, conversed with him that first time, he flashed me the OK 
sign. He told Paul about the problems we were having communicating with 
contractors before we even hired anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Paul said, "People are always having problems with their contractors, so I try 
to stress the service." He genuinely seemed to mean it. 
</P>
<P>
We hired Paul on the spot, minutes after he and his partner, Dan, presented 
their bid, three days after they first toured our home -- and we didn't have a 
comparison bid. 
</P>
<P>
Before the pair showed up four minutes early on that Thursday morning in March, 
my husband and I nervously made bets with each other on what the bid would be. 
(The loser got to be in charge of the remodel). 
</P>
<P>
A bid of $40,870 (slightly more than we expected) was their proposed amount to 
add on a 12-by-17-foot family room, convert a den into a master bedroom, 
completely renovate and enlarge a second bathroom and add a deck. 
</P>
<P>
Paul assured us it was a realistic amount. The figure did go up, almost $5,000, 
but $1,400 of that was upgrading the tub to a Jacuzzi, another $1,000 was for 
electrical costs that weren't noted on the architect's plans, and the rest was 
for the $100-to-$500 decisions that just add up. 
</P>
<P>
Things went so smoothly -- subcontractors showed up, work was generally ahead 
of schedule -- my husband and I still found something to worry about -- keeping 
up with our contractor. When we couldn't decide between seven tile designs for 
the bathroom, Paul and Dan helped us settle on three tiles in a matter of 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Paul marveled at our ability to make quick decisions, which we attributed to 
the business we're both in -- newspapers -- and the training to meet deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
Every time I told somebody about the fun we were having redoing our house and 
how much we liked our contractor, they responded with, "I have never heard of 
anybody who ever liked their contractor," or "Every single person I know who 
has remodeled ends up firing their contractor," and finally, with "You should 
write a story about it." 
</P>
<P>
So before Paul and Dan left, I told them I was going to write a story about a 
project that went right, a contractor who wasn't an ogre. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be so great, a contractor's dream," Paul said, "But don't forget to 
give yourselves some credit." 
</P>
<P>
"For what?" I asked. "Not caring?" They laughed, but I was alluding to the 
small decisions we deferred to them, such as the molding for the family room 
("Just pick something modern and simple; don't make us think about molding," we 
said) or the glass block ("Just pick out the basic one that everybody knows.") 
</P>
<P>
We looked forward to Paul and Dan arriving at 8 every morning -- a decent hour 
-- so we could admire yesterday's handiwork because they were usually gone when 
we got home. That's another reason the project went well -- we weren't around 
to endure the endless sawing and hammering; we just heard all about it from 
Kate, our baby sitter, who started the same day the construction did. 
</P>
<P>
Living through the remodel was part of the deal we struck with Kate, and she 
developed her own strategy for survival, which became long walks around the 
neighborhood and half-day trips to the park with our then 14-month-old 
daughter, Gillian. 
</P>
<P>
We quickly developed a rapport with Paul, the team manager and cheerleader, and 
Dan, the master of precision, who glanced at a drawing of a floor-to-ceiling 
bookcase on our home computer one morning, then reproduced it life-size the 
next day in the new den. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first week, Paul and I were standing in the shell of the old 
bathroom, trying to decide where to move the toilet because it wouldn't fit in 
the corner where the architect had drawn it. 
</P>
<P>
We were reluctant to move it to the center of the room until Paul suggested 
adding a low glass-block wall to the left of the toilet, which would act as 
high-tech camouflage. Paul picked up on the glass block that was already part 
of the bathroom design, a 10-block terraced window in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
Paul and Dan, both in their late 30s, were full of better ideas, constantly 
fine-tuning the design, bringing the modest project to a higher level.

"What kind of door are you going to put on the bathroom?" Paul asked. We didn't 
know. A door's a door, right? Paul campaigned for a door with personality -- a 
single-panel French door with opaque frosted glass that would still provide 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The small design touches seemed to inspire Paul, who had been enthusiastic from 
the first time he walked through the house -- he liked our ideas, from the 
tongue-and-groove ceiling in the den, to the modern single-panel French doors, 
to the deck that would wrap around the pool. That's another reason we hired 
him. He made us feel like we knew what we were doing. 
</P>
<P>
The last week of the project, which, yes, finished on deadline, we stood around 
reminiscing with Paul and Dan -- about the remodel, but also about trips to 
Europe, basketball games and kids. It felt like the last day of school, when 
you craved the freedom of summer, yet knew you'd miss your friends. 
</P>
<P>
Our daughter was cranky that morning, and Dan said, "She sounds tired." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you know you've been on a project long enough," I said to Dan, "when 
you know the baby's nap schedule."

"Free kids." No, they aren't being given away. That's the brochure to ask for 
in a program by the Greater Ft. Lauderdale Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, 
which allows children accompanied by parents to be housed free in more than 250 
Broward County hotels. They also will be admitted free to more than 30 
attractions and festivals. The program ends Sept. 30. For more information and 
a Free Kids brochure, call (800) 356-1662.

Travel quiz: When was the only time the lights on the Las Vegas Strip were ever 
voluntarily turned out? Answer below. 
</P>
<P>
Indian dance: Visitors to Colorado will have a rare opportunity to attend 
performances by dancers from the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona, when the 
performers appear at Mesa Verde National Park July 7-8. 
</P>
<P>
Shows will take place at 10 a.m., noon, and 2 and 4 p.m. at the Chapin Mesa 
Amphitheater near the archeological museum inside the park. Admission free to 
the dances, but there is a $5 charge per vehicle to enter Mesa Verde National

Some hot news: The new Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel is offering a special 
$100 rate on 10 of its deluxe rooms every time the temperature hits the 
100-degree mark in downtown Los Angeles (as verified by the National Weather 
Service). The first 10 people who call for reservations that night, and ask for 
the special rate, will pay $100 for double occupancy. Normal double-occupancy 
rate is $175. Call (213) 458-6700 for more information and reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Out of work: At least 2,000 hotel workers have lost their jobs in the Mexican 
resort city of Mazatlan because of low occupancy rates, the Notimex news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Notimex quoted Ignacio Zepeda Valdez, president of the Mazatlan Hotel Assn., as 
saying that occupancy rates have been running about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez said the 2,000 laid-off workers compose a quarter of the work force in 
the city's hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
Mazatlan is about halfway between Mexico City and the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
Das Beatles: Cologne is the site of the only museum in Europe that is dedicated 
to the Beatles. The British pop artists from Liverpool are remembered through 
childhood photographs, record album covers, film posters, concert programs and 
various Beatles souvenirs such as mop-top wigs and Sgt. Pepper soup cans. The 
museum, located on Heinsbergstrasse 13, is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday 
from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.

The $198 total is $6 more per day than last year's suggested average budget. 
</P>
<P>
AAA recommends that a family of two adults and two children plan to spend $80 
per day for lodging, $93 a day for meals and $8.40 for each 100 miles of 
driving.

herb favored by many athletes for its quick energy boost comes from? Answer: 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Concorde award: Until Aug. 31 in Washington, D.C., or New York City, on 
eastbound stopovers only, passengers may travel to London on British Airways 
Concorde for the price of a first-class ticket. All that's needed is to

WHEN YOU SEE OUTER BANKS, DUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN YARDLEY, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DUCK, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For generations, vacationers driving from the north to this state's Outer Banks 
crossed Currituck Sound via the Wright Memorial Bridge and then turned right, 
heading due south on Highways 158 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
Their destinations were Kitty Hawk and Okracoke and points in-between: Kill 
Devil Hills, Nags Head, Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Hatteras. That was where 
everybody went; the rest of the Banks was terra incognita. 
</P>
<P>
But now streams of cars turn left off the bridge, driving north to Southern 
Shores and Duck and Sanderling and even all the way to Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century ago, when first I saw the Outer Banks, the paved road -- such 
as it was -- ended at Duck; if you wanted to travel farther you needed a Jeep, 
if not an amphibious tank. Today not merely is the road paved all the way, in 
Southern Shores there are four traffic lights, all erected within the past 
year. And in the heart of beautiful downtown Duck, there's sometimes gridlock 
as motorists fend for parking spaces at Wee Winks and Tommy's Market. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-mile stretch of barrier reef from Kitty Hawk to Corolla -- the North 
Banks, or Currituck Banks, as it is known -- is the latest hot spot in the 
never-ending story of coastal development in the Tar Heel State. 
</P>
<P>
With the rest of the Outer Banks either overbuilt or preserved as national 
seashore, and with the famous old beaches to the south -- Atlantic, Emerald 
Isle, Topsail, Wrightsville, Carolina -- long ago transformed into quasi-urban 
outposts, the North Banks were the last piece of unspoiled Atlantic shoreline; 
these days, though, they're wasting little time in getting spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Duck the cry is, "The yuppies are coming! The yuppies are coming!' -- 
but it's a cry of pleasure rather than pain. 
</P>
<P>
This little spot in the road -- you can't call it a crossroads because there's 
only one road -- was a quiet little fishing village as recently as a decade 
ago, not exactly impoverished but not exactly prosperous, either. But now that 
the big spenders are pouring in from Norfolk and Richmond and, yes, Washington, 
merchants and landowners hereabout are cashing in. Overnight, Duck has become a 
growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 1/2 years ago, when I first stayed at the inn a few miles north of Duck 
proper, early-rising guests found copies of USA Today and the Norfolk 
Virginian-Pilot next to the coffeepot in the lobby; USA Today still awaits 
them, but now the other newspapers of choice are the Wall Street Journal and 
the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
This is good news for an employee of the latter and a habitual reader of both, 
but as one of innumerable signs of what's happening to the old fishing 
settlement, it sends at best a mixed message. 
</P>
<P>
The good part, at least to my eyes, is that the companies and individuals who 
are so busily building up the North Banks are doing so with surprising subtlety 
and restraint; there's not much of the ticky-tack so characteristic of American 
seashore resorts, and there's a lot of pleasant shingle architecture. 
</P>
<P>
But the bad part is that the customs of the city have been brought to the 
coast, and the truth is that those customs aren't always as attractive as we 
city folk like to believe. 
</P>
<P>
In Duck, where not so long ago the principal business was trawling for mullet 
and menhaden, you can now eat blackened mahi-mahi and sip Amstel Light at a 
little restaurant on Currituck Sound, or buy pasta salad and white wine at a 
deli a few steps down the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Caffey's Inlet lifesaving station has been turned into a restaurant where 
the waiter tells you his first name and where the food, though certainly good, 
is Georgetown-trendy. At an elaborately quaint shopping center called 
Scarborough Faire -- yes, F-a-i-r-e -- you can buy polo shirts and "gourmet" 
kitchen supplies, not to mention dresses from India and quilts from Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
It's all just as tasteful as you please, and twice as expensive. My wife and I 
have been here half a dozen times, but always off-season and always at the inn. 
In-season room rates are beyond our means; weekly or monthly house rentals 
rival those at the most exorbitant Delaware and New Jersey resorts. And, as for 
buying a place, well, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
The beach itself may belong to us all, but the places with a view of it are 
strictly for what passes as the elite in this post-Reaganite era. For that 
matter, even a place with nothing to look at except saw grass would strain the 
financial resources of a venture capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
This is good for the merchants and real-estate agents of Duck -- and, believe 
it or not, for those of distant Corolla as well -- and it probably isn't really 
bad for anybody else. Yet, like most of life's blessings, it's been gained at 
considerable cost. 
</P>
<P>
The old North Banks was a distinct, discreet place, with its own culture and 
character; the new one, for all its charm and comfort, is just another 
cookie-cutter playground for the unduly privileged. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well. In his excellent history, "The Outer Banks of North Carolina," David 
Stick writes: "Already, people were complaining that the resort was changing 
and that it was not like the old Nags Head. They longed for the days when Nags 
Head was 'but another name for happiness; lovers walked on the sea-shore; 
doctors practiced without fees,' and it was 'respectable to be seen in 
homespun.' " 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1849. Nearly a century and a half has passed, and the Outer Banks 
have changed beyond the most lunatic dreams of any antebellum developer. Yet, 
they're still the Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, now you can buy a six-pack at Brew-Thru and spandex swimwear at Birthday 
Suit. But you can also watch porpoises play in the Atlantic, swim in a 
thundering surf and wake up to a sunrise that leaves you breathless. So far 
we've somehow managed not to botch that up.

LAST CHANCE FOR GOODWILL GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What, Seattle sold out for the month of July? How could this be? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Seattle's accommodations are not entirely sold out, but you are 
entitled to some concern if you are trying to make hotel reservations and buy 
tickets for the Goodwill Games and related arts festival that gets seriously 
under way next month. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is expected to reach a near-record peak in the Northwest's largest city 
this summer, and there will be memories of 1962 and Seattle's World's Fair, 
still symbolized by the Space Needle. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's going to be a crazy summer, definitely," said Meg Knutson of 
Seattle's Convention and Visitors' Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The summer centerpiece is the Goodwill Games, broadcasting mogul Ted Turner's 
personal Olympiad, which runs from July 20 to Aug. 5. Some of the accompanying 
arts events start earlier, and some run into the fall. The Visitors' Bureau 
conservatively estimates that about 60,000 tourists will come to town during 
the July 20-Aug. 5 period. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the largest crowd of all -- one that has nothing at all to do with 
Turner's spectacular -- will show up between July 2 and 8. That week, about 
45,000 delegates will pour into the city for an international convention of 
Alcoholics Anonymous. That week, Seattle really is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are available for the games and arts festival, although some events 
have been sold out. "Rooms are available all over town for the games," although 
space is tightening up, Knutson said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's first games were held in Moscow in 1986, when Americans and Soviets 
were still locked into the Cold War. In 1980, the Americans had boycotted the 
Moscow Olympics, and the Soviet team didn't show up for the L.A. Olympics of 
1984. Two years later, Turner's games were meant to promote goodwill, or at 
least "better will," with the U.S.S.R. So it's no surprise to find that Russian 
arts predominate in the Seattle festival events, leading off with the Bolshoi 
Ballet July 2-8. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Bolshoi sold out fast. Finding a seat now would be virtually 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Bolshoi, the chances are good that you can find tickets for most 
of the other arts events. The sold-out games and events are, as you would 
expect, the popular ones held in small arenas: diving, swimming, water polo, 
ice skating. Some gymnastics tickets are still available but will go fast. 
</P>
<P>
You can still buy tickets for the games' opening ceremonies at 5:45 p.m. July 
21. High prices ($200 for the top ticket) account in part for the slow demand 
for the grand opening, although the price drops to $35 at the lower end. 
</P>
<P>
Track and field events will be held at Husky Stadium on the University of 
Washington campus, where seating is more abundant. The only event free to 
spectators, and the only one in which ordinary people can compete, is the 
Goodwill Marathon, which starts (7 a.m. July 21 for the men, 7 a.m. the next 
day for the women) and finishes at Husky Stadium. Runners of less than world 
class can enter the marathon as late as the preceding day but must pay a late 
charge above the $25 entry fee. And TAC (The Athletics Congress) membership is 
required. 
</P>
<P>
Until June 22, Alaska Airlines is offering a games package of air fare plus 
hotel accommodations. For one person flying from Los Angeles or Long Beach, and 
staying five days at either the Mayflower Park or the Vance Hotel (both 
downtown, with space available at last report) the package adds up to $505. At 
the Executive Inn in nearby Tacoma, about 30 miles south of Seattle, where some 
of the games and festival events will be held, five nights plus round-trip air 
fare from Los Angeles or Long Beach will cost $466 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Athough availability is limited, Alaska Airlines also is selling events tickets 
on a request basis as part of its package. 
</P>
<P>
Going on your own, a call to a major hotel chain's 800 number or to your travel 
agent will probably produce accommodations of some sort -- as long as you don't 
run up against Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Major hotels downtown generally charge $100 and up a night, although some 
motels offer less expensive rates. A room at the TraveLodge near the Space 
Needle is $85 a night. Hotels near the airport between Seattle and Tacoma 
charge $85 and up. For hotel information, call Seattle's Convention and 
Visitors' Bureau at (206) 461-5840. 
</P>
<P>
For tickets to sports contests, as well as most of the arts events, the number 
to call is (206) 292-1990. A "passport" ticket that will admit you to the 
festival's four major arts exhibitions is $14.50. The "passport" also can be 
purchased at any of the arts event sites. 
</P>
<P>
The scorecard for events and tickets: 
</P>
<P>
Goodwill Games: Opening ceremonies and track events available; availability 
tightening up for other events. Ticket prices for track and field range from $5 
to $25; prices for baseball at Cheney Stadium in Tacoma also go from $5 to $25, 
the latter for the gold and bronze medal games July 31. 
</P>
<P>
Bolshoi Ballet: Well nigh impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Kabuki Theatre of Japan: Some performances not available but not sold out 
at last report. July 12, 13, 14 at Seattle Center Opera House. Tickets $15 to 
$50.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: FROM SOUP TO NUTS, THIS PARIS FLEA MARKET HAS SOMETHING FOR 
EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you leave the Metro at Porte de Clignancourt to browse through Paris' 
Marche aux Puces, the grande mere of flea markets, your first impressions may 
be discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
Although the streets are lined with vendors, they're offering only poorly made 
leather bags and jackets, cheap jeans and gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
Aggressive hawkers, who are mostly North Africans, shout sing-song faux French 
that makes you think you've just arrived in Morocco, instead of a Parisian 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Walk a little farther. Turn off Avenue Michelet into Rue des Rosiers and you 
will find about 3,000 dealers who sell their wares from permanent stalls, car 
trunks, cardboard boxes and on folding tables. There is an extraordinary range 
of antiques, vintage clothes, memorabilia and curiosities. This is the Marche 
aux Puces that's loved by millions. 
</P>
<P>
Although you're not likely to discover a Renoir tucked among the old prints or 
a signed Galle vase forgotten at a bin bottom, you can acquire collectibles for 
about one-third of what similar items cost at Left Bank antique shops. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Marche aux Puces suffered a bad reputation and savvy 
Parisians seemed to leave the area to the tourists. But things have changed as 
sellers became more responsible and prices more reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Marche aux Puces is so huge, seeing it all can be exhausting. Occupying four 
square miles, the market is made up of seven different sections: Vernaison, 
Biron, Cambo, Serpette, Paul-Bert, Jules-Valles, Malik. Each section is 
independently owned, has its own entrance and specializes in merchandise that's 
not sold by the others. 
</P>
<P>
The largest of the markets, Vernaison, 99 Rue des Rosiers and 136 Avenue 
Michelet, is a maze of stalls featuring a hodgepodge of antique furniture and 
objets d'art from a variety of periods. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of it is of 1950s vintage, occasionally pieces date from the 
mid-19th Century and lovely Deco desks and dressers sell for under $400. Small 
chests, old wooden boxes, straight-back and bentwood chairs, glass-front 
bookcases and file cabinets abound. 
</P>
<P>
Many dealers display old post cards, photos, prints and posters from the turn 
of the century, priced from $1.50 to $150. There are art and theatrical 
posters, plus delicate, idyllic illustration prints from antique books and 
dozens of souvenir post cards, particularly from French provinces and 
historical Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of Vernaison is Chez Louisette, a cafe/bistro that has the 
ambience of a Toulouse-Lautrec painting and characters in modern dress. The 
food is charcuterie, with soups and daily luncheon specials selling for under 
$10. A floor show by singers and accordion-playing accompanists, clowns and 
jugglers is performed periodically by the waiters. 
</P>
<P>
Marche Biron, 85 Rue des Rosiers, expensive and exclusive, has a long corridor 
lined with dealers displaying elegant Napoleon III furniture, plus antique 
crystal chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
Not much in Marche Biron costs less than $500. Left Bank antique dealers, who 
prowl here in search of pieces to resell at astronomic prices in their own 
shops, knowingly request the prix marchand, or dealer's price. You can try the 
same and perhaps get a 10% to 15% discount. You can try for a discount in other 
sections, too, but your chances of success are best in Biron, where the prices 
are highest. 
</P>
<P>
Marche Cambo, 75 Rue des Rosiers, sells late 19-Century paintings, including 
canvasses by lesser known Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. The artists' 
names may not set off bells of recognition, but pleasing paintings can be 
bought for less than $250. 
</P>
<P>
Marche Cambo also offers English mahogany furniture in good condition at 
reasonable prices. An oval dining table with six chairs from the early 19th 
Century was about $900. An elegant small chest with four drawers was $350. 
</P>
<P>
Marche Serpette, 110 Rue des Rosiers, is good for furniture and decorative 
objects from the 1930s through 1950s, as well as French provincial furniture. 
Aside from handsome pine tables (from $200), chairs (from $170) and cupboards 
(from $300), Marche Serpette sells vintage plastic everything. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen containers, clocks and radios, lamps and electric fans, modern chairs 
and night tables. It's the French equivalent of things that might be found in 
granny's attic if they hadn't been given away. Prices are reasonable: pretty 
platters sell for $8 and complete table service for four might cost $75. 
</P>
<P>
Marche Paul-Bert, Rue des Rosiers 96, has as wide a range of merchandise as 
Serpette, but most of it is simply used furniture and household goods, without 
the fashionable vintage. However, several Marche Paul-Bert dealers specialize 
in bronzes, small and large. A carry-on-sized bust of a handsome but obscure 
French politician might cost $80. Life-sized nudes can cost $1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Marche Jules-Valles, 7 Rue Jules-Valles, offers small items such as antique 
dolls and toys and vintage art books. It has antique playing cards in worn 
leather cases for $10, stuffed bears with moveable limbs for $12 and old maps 
from $7. 
</P>
<P>
Marche Malik, 23 Rue Jules-Valles, specializes in vintage clothing and costume 
jewelry. Most date from the 1950s (an unusual gray flannel circle skirt with a 
bright pink flannel poodle applique sells for $60), but there are several 
stalls with antique lace blouses (from $45) and petticoats (from $35). 
</P>
<P>
Second-hand eyeglass frames ($20 and up for wire), sunglasses, old recordings 
by opera singers or jazz musicians ($5 and up) are the best buys. 
</P>
<P>
Marche aux Puces dealers can be tough and aloof. They don't enjoy chatting, 
particularly in English. Some will get angry if you bargain and most give you a 
hard time when you request tax rebate forms. Don't be intimidated. If you can't 
get an item on your terms, continue to the next stall. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of high prices for "copies" and/or "married" pieces in which elements 
from separate antiques are combined to make one piece. Although Marche aux 
Puces has been cleaned up considerably, there are still many fakes. 
</P>
<P>
Transactions are by cash or check. However, get a receipt that exactly 
describes your purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The market is open Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Early Saturday morning is the 
slowest period and it's when the offerings are best. Sunday afternoon is 
incredibly crowded; beware of pickpockets. On Monday some stalls close. 
However, those that are open might be willing to bargain to clear items left 
from Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
While in the neighborhood, don't miss Honore Paris, 132 Rue des Rosiers, a 
home-decorating store with unusual furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Brass tables, for example, look like giant brass crabs with claws supporting a 
glass disc through which you can see a huge agate rock nestled on the crab's 
back -- and the rock lights up! There are cobra lamps with brass-coiled bases 
and light-bulb heads, peacock beds, upside-down bear tables and butterfly 
couches. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are subject to change due to currency fluctuation.

CONSUMER REPORT: MORE VACATION FOR LESS AT VILLAGES; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: HOLIDAY CENTERS ARE SELF-CONTAINED RESORT AREAS THAT PROVIDE AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO EXPENSIVE EUROPEAN HOTELS. THEY CAN MAKE TRAVELING WITH CHILDREN 
EASIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for a way to save money on a family holiday in Europe? 
</P>
<P>
Consider a vacation center, also known as a holiday or vacation village. They 
are in West Germany, Scandinavia, France, the Netherlands and other countries 
in Western Europe. Although still used primarily by Europeans, they are 
increasingly popular among American families looking for alternatives to 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Usually found in resort areas away from major cities, many vacation villages 
are strategically placed along coasts, adjacent to lakes and in mountain areas. 
Accessible by car, you can also reach them by rail or motor coach. 
</P>
<P>
These self-contained resort areas may offer such accommodations as apartments, 
bungalows or chalets. Some centers operate year-round, others only during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Villages may include high-rise apartment buildings, marinas featuring boating 
and aquatic sports, indoor and outdoor pools, sports and equestrian facilities, 
a variety of restaurants and auditoriums with nightly shows. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a supervised playground, children may be able to take ferry 
rides and go on excursions to nearby museums and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations are usually rented for a week or longer. However, shorter stays 
may be possible, especially during the off-season. The cost of a week at a 
vacation center is generally less than a week at a hotel in a major city. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, accommodations are usually more spacious than at conventional hotels. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a typical apartment might include one or more bedrooms, a living 
room and a full kitchen or kitchenette. 
</P>
<P>
Guests who don't bring their own linens and towels are charged additionally for 
these items. A cleanup fee also might be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
Some accommodations, however, might include cooking utensils, tableware and 
linen. Dishwashers and automatic coffee-makers may be other domestic amenities. 
Laundromats are usually available at the centers. 
</P>
<P>
Utilities such as heat, electricity and gas may be charged according to 
consumption or incorporated in the basic rates. 
</P>
<P>
Damp 2000 on West Germany's Baltic Sea coast near Denmark is a holiday center 
that features apartments and bungalows, restaurants with children's menus, 
riding stables, indoor and outdoor pools, a bathing beach, a gymnasium, 
windsurfing, sailing, bowling, miniature golf and a children's playground. 
</P>
<P>
Weekly rates for a double apartment between June and August are about $285. A 
larger apartment for a family of four is about $570. 
</P>
<P>
Denmark has more than 65 vacation centers. Danland, one major holiday center 
chain, has facilities in Blokus, Faborg, Fand, Sondervig and Mon. 
</P>
<P>
"These vacation villages are family-oriented and good for travelers with 
children, as they're located on the seaside or at waterfronts," said Maibritt 
Hupseld of the Danish Tourist Board in New York City. "Travelers can also save 
money compared to accommodations in the cities. The great majority of people 
speak English, so there is no language barrier." 
</P>
<P>
Hupseld estimated that the weekly cost of an apartment with four to eight 
people at one of these Danish villages is $550 to $750 during the summer 
season. 
</P>
<P>
A village at Stege on the island of Zeeland in the Netherlands offers an indoor 
pool, a children's pool and a children's playground, as well as discounts on 
children's meals, a restaurant, a sauna, a Laundromat and various stores. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the Netherlands are the Vendorado Bungalow Parks, which offer 
self-contained bungalows for up to six people. Amenities include indoor and 
outdoor pools, restaurants, supermarkets, gift stores, bowling alleys and 
discos. 
</P>
<P>
At Zandvoort, one bungalow park has 400 bungalows, 125 apartments and an indoor 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer season at Loohorst, figure on a tab of about $50 to $100 for 
a one-week rental of a double bungalow, $150 for a larger unit accommodating 
four or more guests. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of these vacation villages are in Northern Europe. The Dean Hamlet 
Holiday Complex at St. Julians in Malta has nearly 60 one- to three-bedroom 
apartments accommodating two to seven guests, plus an on-site mini-market, a 
Chinese restaurant, a pub, a game room and a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign government tourist offices in the United States or tourism offices in 
the country itself are the best sources of information on vacation centers. 
</P>
<P>
Make arrangements well in advance, especially during the summer season, because 
these holiday centers are also popular with Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Although travel agents may not handle such bookings, since vacation villages 
generally don't pay commissions, agents, however, could process a booking and 
add a fee for their service. 
</P>
<P>
Also, rates quoted may fluctuate with the daily changes in the value of the 
dollar. Find out if a value-added tax is applied to such rentals and, if so, 
how much it is.

BARGAIN CORNER: CHECK COMP RENTAL CARS IN HAWAII

</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are planning a trip to Hawaii, look into one of the programs that offers 
complimentary rental cars when you book rooms -- including some condominiums -- 
at regular rates.

<P>
The deals generally include unlimited mileage, though you may face refueling 
charges if you don't bring the cars back with a full tank. Insurance and other 
coverages are optional. 
</P>
<P>
The cars are usually automatic compacts and subcompacts, and may come equipped 
with air-conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Outrigger Hotels has a Free Ride program covering 21 hotels in Waikiki, and one

A Car, runs until Dec. 19.

CRUISE VIEWS: LURING THOSE BABY BOOMERS TO SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No longer are cruises just for retired people. More and more, cruise companies 
are attracting the 40-ish "baby boomer" crowd that has leisure time and 
disposable income to spend, "thirtysomething" couples with two incomes, 
affluent young singles and families. 
</P>
<P>
Before the recent flood of ship-company mergers, companies could be loosely 
divided into those that targeted active young passengers -- such as Carnival, 
Royal Caribbean and Norwegian cruise lines -- and those that were dedicated to 
the older, more conservative passengers -- such as Royal Viking, Holland 
America and Royal Cruise lines. 
</P>
<P>
Kloster Cruises, the parent of Norwegian Cruise Line, bought Royal Viking 
several years ago and changed one of the line's four ships, Royal Viking Star, 
into a "ship for the young," expanding spa and gymnasium facilities while 
adding a table-tennis court and a jogging track. Also, Kloster enlarged its 
nightclub and casino, and, more importantly, shortened the length of cruises 
and lowered prices. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Kloster retained traditional RVL niceties such as the 
one-meal sitting instead of two an evening. 
</P>
<P>
To jazz up the appeal of its seven-day Bermuda cruises from New York City, it's 
offering major blues and jazz musicians, well-known guest chefs, and is cashing 
in on the latest rage among the under-40 crowd, tee times at Bermuda's top golf 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, on a recent sailing from New York City to Bermuda, several upscale 
Royal Viking Star cabins had to be furnished with baby cribs for the young 
families that had signed up for the cruise. 
</P>
<P>
When Princess Cruises merged with Sitmar Cruises in 1988, it converted a 
partially built ship then under construction in France into the Star Princess, 
which made its debut in the Caribbean in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Although Princess and Sitmar had always attracted passengers of all ages, 
including, in Sitmar's case, families with young children, both carried a 
preponderance of middle-aged and older couples. 
</P>
<P>
The Star Princess, however, made a strong appeal to young vacationers with an 
entire deck dedicated to sunbathing, swimming, lounging and socializing. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, passengers can wear bathing suits all day, and, only steps away, partake 
of a self-service restaurant offering breakfast, lunch and tea, a pizzeria and 
two bars, one with swim-up service, the other with a variety of colorful drinks 
with or without alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, within 12 months, the median age of Star Princess passengers 
dropped seven years from its fleetwide average. 
</P>
<P>
Holland America, purchased by Carnival two years ago, brought its Westerdam 
back home this year from a German shipyard after being stretched 130 feet. It 
added 195 cabins and enlarged its public rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The ship also was made more accessible to younger passengers, adding such 
trendy touches as late-evening karaoke in the nightclub. Popular in Japan and 
now making inroads into West Coast cities, karaoke enables amateur singers to 
select from a menu of songs and perform them in public. Using prerecorded 
orchestration, participants sing into an amplified microphone while following 
the lyrics on a TV screen. Almost anyone can end up sounding like a favorite 
pop or rock star. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Westerdam offers music that appeals to its older 
passengers. Each evening a lounge features big-band music for dancing, another 
light classics in a quiet setting. A pianist plays and sings show tunes in a 
third and a quartet plays amplified pop and rock in a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
So far it seems as if the policies resulting from the industry's many mergers 
and acquisitions are broadening the appeal of the larger ships. 
</P>
<P>
One notable exception is Kloster's most recent acquisition, Royal Cruise Line, 
known for its successful programs for older travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Royal's two ships, Golden Odyssey and Crown Odyssey, appeal strongly to women 
traveling alone or with other women, because they provide guest "hosts" for 
dancing, bridge and escorts for shore excursion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the host program, the ships offer low-fat, low-salt diets and 
various types of seminars with subjects designed for the over-55 travelers.

SANTA FE VIEWPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article by Jerry Hulse on Santa Fe was interesting, colorful and 
informative. How I envy him. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to add a few facts that may interest your readers so that they can 
become aware of the historic significance of Santa Fe and the history of the 
people who founded it. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us do not have the time or inclination to study history. But articles 
such as yours can give us incentive to travel as well as to educate us in a 
delightful way. 
</P>
<P>
As a genealogy buff, I have had the pleasure of researching my roots four 
centuries in America -- exactly 392 years. Twenty-eight of my ancestors came to 
New Mexico with the Juan de Onate Expedition in 1598, hence most of the 
founders of Santa Fe were my ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
So you see, Santa Fe isn't just art galleries and blue corn tortillas. Santa Fe 
is history, real people. People with dreams, people with faith who dared to 
leave their beloved Spain to find a new life in a new world. Every building has 
a story or a ghost, each path taken a destiny. 
</P>
<P>
When I visit the plaza, I sit in the warm sun listening to the voices of the 
past. I hear the church bells calling the people to prayer, the laughter of 
little children. I envision the secret places where lovers met, far from the 
eyes of disapproving parents. I feel overcome with sadness and anger as I 
imagine the deals that were made by unscrupulous Americans as they conspired to 
take over New Mexico in 1846. But I smile as I see the melding of the three 
cultures -- Spanish, Indian and Anglo -- all trying to live peacefully in this 
most beautiful of cities.

SANTA FE VIEWPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wonder if there is room for an opposing view on Jerry Hulse's Santa Fe in the 
June 3 Travel Section? 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I finally succumbed to the annual hype on Santa Fe and Taos, and 
last month we spent a week there wondering what all the hoopla was about. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe is the Tijuana of New Mexico. The shops are a boring succession of the 
identical merchandise (jewelry, pottery, and the like), with prices on the same 
items varying from 20% to 50%. Buyer beware! The "Santa Fe style" wears on one 
very quickly, and everything is just too precious and self-conscious (when it 
isn't busy being pretentious). 
</P>
<P>
The galleries (including that fraudulent area known as Canyon Road) are filled 
with very little talent demanding prices unheard of anywhere in the West. 
</P>
<P>
But before you think we are entirely peevish about New Mexico, I urge all to go 
the extra distance to the jewel of a museum in Roswell, and to the Carlsbad 
Caverns. And if you are physically able, take the Blue Tour, during which you 
walk down 83 stories (on gently and sometimes steeply slanting ramps). The 
sights and wonder of it all will knock your socks off. And don't miss the 
twilight "Bat Flight."

SANTA FE VIEWPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My daughter and I just returned last week from a trip to Santa Fe, which (made 
me) interested me in your June 3 article on that town by Jerry Hulse. 
</P>
<P>
I would agree with your restaurant recommendations, with the exception of the 
Coyote Cafe. We had been looking forward to a return visit to this trendy 
restaurant since our first visit in 1987. What a disappointment! We suggest an 
alternative just a block away: the restaurant in the Hotel St. Francis. You'll 
find real Santa Fe hospitality there in addition to Old World charm.

HANDING OVER THE WANTED UNWANTED CHILD; 
</P>
<P>
AN OPEN ADOPTION BY LINCOLN CAPLAN (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $17.95; 137 
PP.; 0-374-10558-8) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Wanda Urbanska, Urbanska, author of The Singular Generation, is co-writing a 
book for Viking on simplicity in the age of the consumer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Peggy Bass, a 20-year-old college student, spotted an ad in her hometown 
paper from a couple seeking to adopt a baby, she was seven months pregnant. 
Lacking steady employment, her boyfriend Tom, a recent college graduate, was 
not yet ready for marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy called the number listed, which turned out to be a California agency 
specializing in arranging open adoptions. Over the phone, Peggy was read 
thumbnail sketches of three couples seeking to adopt. She selected one -- an 
infertile Boston couple in their late 30s -- who eventually would become her 
baby's adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
Author Lincoln Caplan, himself the adoptive father of a daughter, traces the 
saga of what is doubtless one of the most emotionally fraught of all human 
transactions: the transfer of a newborn from a woman whose life has no room for 
motherhood to a couple for whom a baby is a long-awaited miracle. Caplan uses 
the four-way story of Peggy, Tom and adoptive parents Dan Stone and Lee Duncan 
to elucidate the emerging trend toward open adoption, taking care to identify 
the many emotional pitfalls and legal hazards along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Caplan, an attorney and author of "The Insanity Defense and the Trial of John 
W. Hinckley Jr." and "The Tenth Justice: The Solicitor General and the Rule of 
Law," defines an open adoption as "one in which the birth parents meet the 
adoptive parents, participate in the separation and placement process, 
relinquish all legal, moral and nurturing rights to the child, but retain the 
right to continuing contact and to knowledge of the child's whereabouts and 
welfare." For many birth parents, who find themselves increasingly in the 
driver's seat vis-a-vis the placement of their progeny, open adoption offers an 
attractive alternative to the traditional, closed, confidential route (in which 
the birth mother surrenders her newborn to an agent or go-between, never to lay 
eyes on, or have any contact with, that child again). 
</P>
<P>
A diminished pool of infants available for adoption in the United States -- due 
in part to the prevalence of abortion and in part to the social acceptance of 
single parenting -- and a markedly higher incidence of infertility among 
married couples have combined to make the search for the elusive infant a 
poignant, trying and common one. Indeed, for the last 15 years, just 50,000 
babies annually have been put up for adoption, down from a peak of 89,200 in 
1970, according to Caplan. "While the rate of out-of-wedlock birth doubled, the 
percentage of single mothers who gave up their babies dropped sharply," he 
writes, noting that today 24 out of 25 unmarried new mothers choose to keep 
their unplanned babies. 
</P>
<P>
Bass might have gone that route, too, were she not so headstrong about adoption 
and clever at concealing her condition from her parents. "She didn't want to 
tell her family, with whom she lived . . . (as) she was sure they would insist 
on helping her keep the baby." 
</P>
<P>
After designating Dan and Lee as the adoptive parents for her child, Peggy 
moved to Boston so that they could offer support and be on hand for the birth 
of the baby she was already calling theirs. Aware of the delicacy of the 
situation, Dan and Lee honored Peggy's wishes, housing her with friends and 
taking her out for dinner every week as if they were "dating" her. On the one 
hand, they wanted to do everything possible to ease her burden. On the other, 
they felt uneasy that Peggy's and Tom's parents had been kept in the dark about 
the pregnancy for fear that, upon discovery, they might contest the adoption. 
Further, Massachusetts law requires that the mother wait four days after giving 
birth before signing adoption papers -- in order that she be able to change her 
mind. Braced for crushing disappointment (a non-factor in the case of closed 
adoption), they had to walk a highwire act around solidity while masking their 
vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Peggy seemed never to doubt her decision and appeared to relish 
her role of birth mother, jokingly referring to herself as "the adoption 
fairy"; after childbirth, she attached to her daughter's wrist the name Rebecca 
Duncan Stone. Ironically, despite Peggy's magnanimity, it was she who 
eventually pulled away from the triangle. Returning home to Tom, she quickly 
got pregnant again, had an abortion, and before long the pair broke up. Through 
her mother, Peggy asked Dan and Lee to stop sending baby pictures; only then 
did they begin to fathom Peggy's repressed anguish that summer. 
</P>
<P>
Caplan does an able job of reporting the emotional currents swirling in this 
drama of maternity. However, much of the book fails to transcend a rough-draft 
feel, with its heavy use of blocks of transcript and the concomitant lack of 
authorial interpretive analysis. It is as if Caplan were trying to keep a 
distance from the material, holding his own emotions at bay in an attempt to 
maintain objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, he piles on unnecessary detail, such as what the couples ate for 
lunch the day they met, how they dressed, without demonstrating the emotional 
or character significance of these details. Given the slim, 137-page text, one 
cannot help but suspect Caplan of padding to stretch an article -- much of 
which originally appeared in The New Yorker -- into a box. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for the reader unacquainted with the subject, "An Open Adoption" 
provides a useful introduction. Peggy's story is interwoven with an overview of 
historical attitudes toward, and studies regarding, adoption, as well as the 
case for and against open adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the book's most graphic image is of the rows of unwanted babies laid 
out in 1920s maternity wards; adoptive parents could stroll the aisles until 
one caught their fancy. In that era, unwed mothers were met with contempt. 
Today, unwed mothers willing to give up their infants for adoption have emerged 
as maternity princesses and are occasionally met at airports with limousines. 
This shift in the balance of power is no doubt disconcerting for would-be 
adoptive parents, most of whom are in a higher socio-economic class from the 
birth parents. Given this new landscape, however, despite their small troubles, 
Dan Stone and Lee Duncan appear to be a very lucky couple indeed.

HOW SAFE IS LAX? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burton's piece failed to address the primordial problem we have and one that 
would be the easiest to deal with -- reducing the frequencies of flights on 
certain routes. The first obvious one is the LAX/San Francisco service. 
</P>
<P>
In one given day, we now have: United Airlines, one flight every half hour in 
each direction; US Air, 14 or more every hour -- plus Delta, Pan Am and other 
carriers serving that same route on their way to and from other destinations. 
Why shouldn't business people -- who represent the bulk of those passengers 
using the L.A. Basin/Bay Area route -- organize their appointments according to 
an airline schedule, rather than the other way around? Sounds to me, once 
again, like big business versus public safety.

The media need to stop using the "near-miss" phrase. It is misleading and 
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
A near miss is a hit. If aircraft do not collide, that should be called a near 
hit. Or the FAA phrase "near mid-air collision" should be used.

I am disgusted by the Republican Administration's lackadaisical manana 
attitude: We cannot expect state-of-the-art equipment until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, the equipment will be that many years behind the current state of 
the art. With our American prowess in technology, it is criminal that the 
safety of millions is being treated in such a cavalier fashion.

A percentage of this funding is to come from higher user fees for passengers. 
It will amaze me to hear the public complain about the intrusion on their 
wallets, even though the need for such funding clearly exists. Air fares are a 
bargain compared to what many of these air travelers are willing to pay to dine 
at their favorite restaurant in Los Angeles.

SCULPTURE AT ITS PRIME IN 'PRIMAL SPIRIT'; 
</P>
<P>
AN EXHIBITION OF 10 JAPANESE SCULPTORS AT THE COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART IS AN 
ORIGINAL PIECE OF WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When asked why he didn't paint from nature, Jackson Pollock replied, "I am 
nature." Any of the 10 contemporary Japanese sculptors in "A Primal Spirit" 
could say the same even though it's hard to imagine them echoing Pollock's 
arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is quietly spectacular and a triumph for its curator, Howard 
Fox, with its citadels of logs, dancing tree-trunks and serene stone circles. 
In organizational terms it is a highly original piece of business, ranking 
close to the museum's "German Expressionist Sculpture" in its revelation of art 
we didn't even know was there. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to claim absolute originality for the work itself. Anyone who has 
ever seen a Zen and garden, bonsai tree, Raku pot or tea house will find 
something familiar here. So will anyone who has ever seen an Abstract 
Expressionist painting or attended one of those European summer extravaganzas 
of contemporary art with their huge site-specific installations. There are 
apparent Western precedents for this work in everybody from Carl Andre to Alice 
Aycock. 
</P>
<P>
How could it be otherwise? The modern West has admiringly soaked up Oriental 
art ever since the Impressionists fell in love with prints from the floating 
world. Franz Kline's paintings used to be compared with Far Eastern 
calligraphy. California artists such as Robert Irwin and Ed Moses would be in 
big trouble without Zen. 
</P>
<P>
In a world of easy travel and instantaneous communication, how could these 
Japanese artists not know and absorb such aspects of Western art as seem 
pertinent to their own? 
</P>
<P>
Kazuo Kenmochi's installation includes a mound-shaped 40-foot wall of 
wooden-crate detritus randomly painted in dark pitch. Its structure suggests 
armor plate, its shape the aftermath of destruction. Its backdrop is a 
checkered wall of painted-over landscape photographs in deep brown and fire 
orange that strongly echo the work of West Germany's Anselm Kiefer. An 
inescapable connection is drawn between the havoc Germany brought down on 
itself in World War II and the nuclear holocaust at Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
Kenmochi's work resembles the rest in its evocation of large, sometimes 
devastating forces but is singular in its allusion to a contemporary event and 
nearly unique in its incorporation of painting. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance Isamu Wakabayashi appears as a painter. His "Sulfuret Garden -- 
A Distant Imagery" is made up of a series of hanging copper panels, some blank, 
some bearing a rough dark rectangle that looks painted. It's not. Shapes are 
formed from pitting and darkening caused by a chemical reaction between the 
metal and applied sulfur. In the center of the room stand two masses shaped 
like cotton bales stained with sulfur yellow. There is a hint that the flat 
copper shapes come from contact with the bales, creating a byplay of substance 
and shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Wakabayashi brings us closer to the essence of "A Primal Spirit" in his 
involvement with the elemental forces of nature -- the Earth, Air, Fire and 
Water of the I-Ching and astrology. The general genius of these artists comes 
from maintaining the ancient Oriental belief that humankind is a part of 
nature, neither its master or its steward but simply a link in the cosmic 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
Universalism has traditionally led Japanese artists to seek expression through 
a kind of anti-originality. It's well-known that the Japanese aesthetic makes 
no particular distinction between art, craft, and decoration or, for that 
matter, between the aesthetic worth of something man-made and that of a 
particularly fetching rock or tree. 
</P>
<P>
Far from resulting in a debased visual culture, the attitude has produced one 
of the rare civilizations where so-called craft objects possess such 
extraordinary quality they are self-evidently works of art. Much here requires 
a double-take before we're sure it wasn't phenomenally formed by quirky 
collaboration between humans, time and the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Shigeo Toya's remarkable "Woods" shows serried ranks of 28 whitened man-tall 
wooden uprights that seem to have gotten their shapes from centuries of 
erosion, dry rot, termites, lightning bolts and hungry worms. Some unmistakable 
presence haunts each post, as alive and awesome as an ancestral spook. Talk 
about animism. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at Chuichi Fuji's tormented tree trunks lies somewhere between watching 
a gardener artfully wire a Japanese black pine and witnessing the antics of the 
Pilobolus dancers. Massive hairy bark trunks do deep abdominal bends over one 
another. Amusing, ominous and philosophical, they are at one moment like 
something out of "Fantasia" and the next a deep rumination on the nature of 
paradox. How Fuji manages to make pretzel bends in great cypress and cedar is a 
mystery that doesn't bother much. He's so artful it looks like it just 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
Few of these artists have big reputations even at home. Toshikatsu Endo has 
cracked the ranks of the international mainstream and maybe that's not so good. 
He's about the only artist in the show whose work betrays Western-style 
self-consciousness. His untitled ring of stone is distinctive enough to stand 
apart from similar work by Richard Long. But Endo forces the issue by having 
three of the stones cast in bronze. Instead of triggering the insight of a 
haiku verse, the move feels tinny. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Endo joins the others in the attitude of submissive detachment that 
lends the work its amazing clout. Because it appears to have somehow happened 
spontaneously we have no sense of some massive human ego trying to force its 
vision of things on us. Nothing gets between us and the aesthetic experience. 
We have the refreshing sense that we have discovered and somehow created it 
ourself. 
</P>
<P>
Artists here who don't play at being nature undertake the role of the humble 
craftsman. Emiko Tokushige is the only woman on board and she assumes the role 
of a basket-maker fashioning objects from palm fiber, rope, cotton, old 
stockings and whatnot. At a glance her big pieces could be basketry beanbags 
and the little stuff tiny containers. It only takes a second to see the 
beanbags as creatures from the atavistic ooze. Purely abstract as they are, 
they could be shiny little rhinos basking malevolently among the dinosaurs. 
Grouped small pieces have the aura of demons with the crackling hair of madmen. 
Tokushige stands among the strongest talents here. 
</P>
<P>
Kimio Tsuchiya plays the eccentric carpenter in a 19-foot-wide fan of lumber 
scraps he calls "Silence." It's impressive when artists get the title right. 
His "Landscape" looks like a bunch of broken log slices stacked so carelessly 
against the wall that some have fallen down. But it's sculpture without doubt. 
The effect is like those stone groupings in sand gardens that appear both 
accidental and inevitable. These guys have a knack for inevitability. 
</P>
<P>
Three remaining artists produce a kind of sculpture-as-architecture. Tadashi 
Kawamata's raw plank piece crawls across the bridge of the museum's central 
court looking for links to the real world and its inner rhythms. Takamasa 
Kuniyasu's piece of criss-crossed logs towers in a tall gallery like the 
battlements of an ancient castle in a samurai film. Rather threatening. It 
takes on another twist because of myriad small bricks inserted between logs. It 
makes one aware of ones microscopic inner workings in its own metaphor of 
cellular growth, 
</P>
<P>
Koichi Ebizuka fools us again by coming on like a builder of traditional 
Japanese architecture with its low porches, simple uprights and virgin wood 
circles filled with pebbles. In the end it is sculpture about a journey through 
changing experiences of vertical, horizontal, straight and crooked, mass and 
plane. There's a charming sense of romance about it. 
</P>
<P>
And about the rest. What these artists have really achieved here is a new 
International Japanese style. Its distinction doesn't come from formal 
invention. It rather re-invests the egotistical, chilly international 
mainstream with passion, poetry and romance.

OTHER LIVES: CITIZEN JANE BY CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 389 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Citizen Jane" also touches on the price required for success in Hollywood, but 
does so by trundling out truckloads of celebrity-bio cliches. Or so it seems; 
after a while it's easier to conclude that Christopher Andersen's subject, Jane 
Fonda, has simply lived one of the prototypal show-biz lives (travel to North 
Vietnam aside). 
</P>
<P>
Unloved daughter of a much-married leading man; rich, horse-riding, rebellious; 
deflowered by older man, college drop-out; discovers hidden acting talent and 
necessary Svengali, becomes sex symbol, marries director; rebels again, finds 
new self and new Svengali; remarries, redivorces, strikes out on her own. . . . 
You get the idea. With a few exceptions -- who knew that she passed up starring 
roles in "Bonnie and Clyde," "Rosemary's Baby," "Carnal Knowledge" and "Dr. 
Zhivago"? -- we seem to be acquainted with Jane's story before Andersen relates 
it. 
</P>
<P>
But familiarity isn't the only problem. Although Andersen has interviewed all 
the famous Fondas, "Citizen Jane" reads as though it were based on others' 
accounts. One longs for Fonda to speak in the present tense -- something that 
occurs only in the last few pages. Andersen's colorful writing and 
pop-psychologizing simply don't make up for his failure to compose a 
considered, reflective portrait. Perhaps it's true that when Jane's mother 
committed suicide there was "a glint from the tiny razor blade that lay on the 
floor near her right hand," or that the men in Jane's life have been father 
substitutes, but emphasis on such things reveal an author willing to sacrifice 
insight for voyeurism. Andersen seems to have gathered most of the facts with 
which to complete the puzzle of Jane's life (and it is a puzzle, considering 
that "Miss Army Reserve Recruiting of 1962" became Hanoi Jane in 1972 and 
Workout Jane by 1982), but he's forced the pieces, hard, into place.

<P>
Generosity is not the outstanding feature of Mary Crow Dog's "Lakota Woman." 
It's impossible to pick up a book by a Native American without sympathy, but 
Crow Dog's shrill, belligerent tone ensures that many readers' compassion 
rapidly evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
She has an interesting story to tell, having participated in the 1973 
occupation of Wounded Knee, but her "Indian good, white bad" posturing -- Crow 
Dog herself is half white (or "honkey," as she sometimes puts it) -- provokes 
only skepticism. "Black Elk" gives a completely different picture of the Sioux, 
describing the tribe's spiritual life instead of its anger, but Crow Dog's book 
makes one a little suspicious of this one, too. That response is undoubtedly 
unfair, but it hints at the fact that some lives are so burdened, or so 
ethereal, that mere words can't do them justice.

OTHER LIVES: BEGINNING BY KENNETH BRANAGH (W. W. NORTON: $19.95; 244 PP.) 
</P>

By CHRIS GOODRICH

<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth Branagh -- newly famous in the United States for his film "Henry V" -- 
is brash to the very center of his being, but his vaulting ambition proves 
endearing; he immediately admits that while at 28 he knows little worth 
repeating, he's happy to take the money offered for his autobiography to help 
subsidize his Renaissance Theatre Company. Branagh comes off like a young 
Welles -- or a young Coppola, for that matter -- but with a significant 
exception; he is less intent on serving his own vision than the Theatre itself. 
</P>
<P>
It may be an act, but Branagh seems good company. Growing up poor near the 
docks of Belfast, Branagh came to love "the crack," which he defines as "the 
Irish word for the pleasure of company, conversation, arguments and songs." 
It's not too much to say that "Beginning" is one long crack in which the reader 
can hardly catch his breath, for Branagh leaps from one story to the next as 
quickly as Gertrude marries Claudius. He's made captain of the rugby and 
football teams at day school in England for "shouting theatrically butch 
encouragement to 'my lads' "; at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, 
he turns down a major role in a BBC film in order to play Hamlet in a school 
production; at graduation he passes up understudying with the Royal Shakespeare 
Company to try out for the West End, succeeds, and finally agrees to join the 
RSC upon being allowed to play Henry V -- at age 23. 
</P>
<P>
Branagh has a way of making these triumphs seem the only possible result of his 
vast enthusiasm for the acting profession. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound boastful, but it isn't. Branagh often reminds us that he's 
plagued by guilt and fear . . . though of what, exactly, one can't say. I'd 
guess that what terrifies him most is the fact that he has taken destiny into 
his own hands -- has boot-strapped himself into fame and fortune by promising 
to do all kinds of things, then discovering he'd sooner fulfill a pledge than 
be called a liar. Branagh's "blind and ridiculous faith," his ability to talk 
with the "airy certainty of the blissfully ignorant," is impossible to resist.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ON THE GOLDEN PORCH BY TATYANA TOLSTAYA (VINTAGE: $8.95)

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
In this impressive collection of stories, Tatyana Tolstaya (the 
great-grandniece of Leo Tolstoy) writes with biting irony about life in the 
Soviet Union before perestroika. Nearly all of these brief tales focus on the 
clash between the fragile dreams that sustain unhappy people and the harsh 
reality of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
A woman savors the company of the opulent connoisseur, Filin, in "The Fakir," 
and the discovery that the treasures in the Ali Baba's cave of his apartment 
are paste leaves an aching void in her life. In "Okkervil River," a weary, 
aging man dreams of the romantic singer Vera Vasilevna, but his pursuit of this 
fantasy goddess leads to the shattering revelation that the object of his 
wistful passion is a fat, demanding old woman who lives off the admirers 
trapped in the web of her faded glamour.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: RUNNING THE AMAZON BY JOE KANE (VINTAGE: $9.95, 
ILLUSTRATED)

<TEXT>
<P>
A lively chronicle of the first expedition to follow the entire 4,200-mile 
course of the Amazon by water, from the barren highlands of southern Peru to 
the oppressively lush jungles of Brazil. Joe Kane and his fellow explorers had 
to contend with impassable rapids, "Shining Path" guerrillas, cocaine 
traffickers and plagues of insects. 
</P>
<P>
What sets this book apart from conventional travelogues is the insightful 
reporting of the psychological tensions that ultimately split the expedition. 
One group followed the obsessive, ineffectual Francois Odendaal who, like 
Gilbert and Sullivan's Duke of Plaza-Toro, lead from behind. Kane and two 
others preferred the leadership of the indomitable Polish kayaker, Piotr 
Chmielinski, who successfully guided them to the delta at Belem. The author 
provides an entertaining account of becoming a river rafter in spite of 
himself, but he fails to explain why anyone would attempt this damnfool stunt 
in the first place.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: TALES FROM THE PLANET EARTH BY ARTHUR C. CLARKE (BANTAM:

Although it doesn't include all of Arthur C. Clarke's stories about Earth ("No 
Morning After" and "The Nine Billion Names of God" are among the notable 
omissions), "Tales" offers some of the writer's finest work from the '50s and 
'60s. "The Road to the Sea" and "The Lion of Comarre" represent early 
explorations of the link between cultural stagnation and technological advance, 
a theme Clarke would develop more fully in "The City and the Stars." The 
bizarre surprise ending of "The Other Tiger" and the disastrously successful 
media hype in "Publicity Campaign" stand out as examples of the deliciously 
black humor that enables Clarke to end the world, not with a bang but a 
snigger.

SHANGHAI'S URBAN RENEWAL EXPECTED TO TAKE 40 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM ABRAMS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SHANGHAI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's largest city has announced plans for an urban renaissance, but says it 
will take billions of dollars, lots of political savvy and about 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Pudong Development Project has won Beijing's qualified endorsement. Now, 
Shanghai must persuade foreign investors that there is hope in this troubled 
metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Shanghai's 12 million people and thousands of factories compete for 
land, air and water in teeming Puxi, on the west side of the Huangpu River. 
</P>
<P>
The development of Pudong, east of the Huangpu, would shift factories, homes 
and people to the 140-square-mile triangle of land between that river and the 
Yangtze. 
</P>
<P>
Among things the city plans to do in the next five years are: finish a third 
bridge across the Huangpu; start construction on a port, power plant and 
waterworks; open an export processing zone for foreign investors, and complete 
a highway circling the city. 
</P>
<P>
Work on a subway linking the two sides of the river is to begin this year. 
Planners envision more highways, another bridge, a second international airport 
and apartments, hospitals and schools for 1.7 million people in Pudong. 
</P>
<P>
Finance and trade centers, high-tech industries and science centers are 
planned. Older factories in Puxi are to be moved to Pudong and modernized. 
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's planners say all that and 40 years to accomplish it will make a 
modern, efficient city of this former capitalist enclave, which has been the 
overworked draft horse of Communist China for the last 40. 
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji, Shanghai's energetic and ambitious mayor, said the city will need 
the equivalent of $10 billion in the first decade. 
</P>
<P>
The national budget has allocated $1.38 billion over the next five years. Much 
of the rest will have to come from foreign investors and the city itself. 
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, the climate for investment is "better than at any time 
in the past and especially better than the time before last June." 
</P>
<P>
He referred to pro-democracy demonstrations and, in June, 1989, the military 
crackdown that frightened off many potential investors and drastically slowed 
loans from the World Bank and other international lenders. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank is backing the new Huangpu bridge and a West German 
consortium has extended credit for more than half the $500 million subway. Such 
lending, agreed upon before June, will be crucial for the Pudong project. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat in Shanghai did not share Zhu's optimism about foreign 
money. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that foreign investment is down sharply thus far this year and that 
Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen are more interested in the special economic 
zones of southern China. 
</P>
<P>
"International lending is blocked up and foreign banks are not exactly doing 
tricks to increase exposure in China," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zhu offers major incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks, now allowed to have branches only in the special economic zones, 
will be invited to Shanghai. Joint ventures will be given tax breaks like those 
in the zones. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses from abroad will be able to obtain leases of 50 to 70 years on large 
tracts of land for development, to issue bonds and stocks and conduct stock 
trading inside and outside China. 
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also is blessed, for once, with strong support from Beijing. Jiang 
Zemin, Zhu's predecessor as mayor, is general secretary of the Communist Party 
and Zou Jiahua, chief of the powerful Central Planning Commission, also is from 
Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, the conservative politicians now on top in Beijing see 
Shanghai, with its large state industries, as a counterbalance to 
capitalism-tainted Canton and the special economic zones in Guangdong and 
Fujian provinces. 
</P>
<P>
"Even without the fear of creeping capitalism, it would make sense for them to 
give fewer favors to Guangdong and try to help out the older industrial bases," 
the Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Shanghai formerly had to pay nearly 90% of its earnings to the state, providing 
about 10% of state revenues. That left too little to repair a rapidly 
deteriorating infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, it was allowed to keep about one-third of revenues, still less than 
other provinces. 
</P>
<P>
The city "made great contributions to the state in the past" and it is time to 
return the favor, Zhu said. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng visited Shanghai in April and endorsed the Pudong project as 
"an event of important strategic significance both to Shanghai and the whole 
country." He said the central government "will provide necessary support and 
the whole country should give active support." 
</P>
<P>
Li added, however, that the city "should rely on the support and efforts of the 
people of Shanghai." 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to reporters two weeks later, Zhu said the city could gain $212 
million a year just by making its antiquated industrial base more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Shanghai's people "have lots of money in their pockets," but also 
quoted a saying that they are "clever but not too wise" -- more concerned with 
short-term profit than long-term interests.

SEN. BRADLEY'S RACE IN NEW JERSEY LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER EASY SLAM-DUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE E. ALLEN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a long time, he feared he'd be known as "Sen. Bill Bradley, former New York 
Knick" for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The image of a man "wearing short pants in drafty arenas" didn't seem to 
enhance the credibility sought by New Jersey's young senator when he arrived 
here in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
So the Rhodes scholar with a great baseline jumpshot deliberately shunned the 
key. 
</P>
<P>
"Dollar Bill" -- a nickname he earned from his pro teammates because of his 
frugal handling of his affairs -- set out to apply his sense of discipline to 
mastery of parliamentary procedure. He built support for tax reform, forging 
alliances until Congress overhauled the tax system in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He fought for the Superfund cleanup bill, child nutrition programs, more 
Medicaid money for poor mothers and children, all the while plunging himself 
into details of foreign policy, Third World debt and international trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is to get things done," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years after what he calls his divorce from basketball, Bradley returns 
alone in the summers to a court near his mountain home in Denville, N.J., to 
relax with his famous five-spot warmups -- "but not the jumpers, you 
understand," he says good-humoredly. 
</P>
<P>
"The heart is willing, but the knees aren't," the former Knicks forward 
laments. 
</P>
<P>
About all he puts them through in Washington these days are sessions shooting 
hoops with his 13-year-old daughter, Theresa Anne. Aides say the daughter he 
devotedly drops at school each morning and cares for four days a week shows 
signs of catching up with her father's legendary technique. 
</P>
<P>
Playing with her has helped him put basketball back into perspective after 
several years in which he believed he could only be taken seriously on Capitol 
Hill by pushing his NBA career firmly into the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I look back and I can think more easily about it; the fact of the matter 
is that I like the game," says Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The senator picks his 6-foot-5 frame up from his office chair during an 
interview over coffee to point out reminders of what he's mastered in his 46 
years: a golden gavel for presiding 100 hours in his first Senate session and 
photographs from his 1970 and 1973 NBA championship victories with the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
He takes equal pride in the gavel and the shot of him wrapped in a bearhug 
around Willis Reed, triumphant after the Knicks' 1973 championship. 
</P>
<P>
Sports metaphors occasionally punctuate his conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"In basketball and in politics, the only score that counts is the one at the 
final buzzer," he says when asked about Republican predictions that his 
opponent will do well to capture 38% of the November vote. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also says he'll serve out another six-year Senate term to the buzzer, 
despite recurring speculation that he will seek the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
His supporters take his word at face value. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that in his heart and his head, he believes he is going to serve out 
his full term," says Harold Hodes, once chief of staff to former New Jersey 
Gov. Brendan T. Byrne. But, he adds, "between 1991 and 1992 a lot of things can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Would waiting until 1996 hurt him? Are supporters pressuring him to run? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very funny thing," Bradley responds. "I assume that's what people talk 
about sometimes, but that's not what they talk about with me. I think people 
respect my sense of service. They know that if they mention anything to me 
about that, that I will say: 'Look, my interest is New Jersey.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bradley-watching has become a pastime within both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Stone, a Republican consultant who helped elect Ronald Reagan, says 
Bradley is conservative enough and independent enough to appeal to GOP voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our party could nominate a Bill Bradley," Stone says. "If you look at his 
votes on Contra aid, defense issues, the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, he looks 
at issues one by one." 
</P>
<P>
And, looking at Bradley's command of 64% of the vote in his last reelection 
bid, Stone adds: "A lot of Republicans obviously voted for him in 1984." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's fair-tax policies have appealed to even some of the most conservative 
voices. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not one of those Democrats who has never met a tax hike he doesn't like," 
says Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
The most common negative that people on both sides say about Bradley is he 
lacks charisma. The word comes up again and again, along with references to 
improvements in his once sleep-inducing speeches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there isn't any Bradley charisma. But it's obvious that he cares about 
people. It's obvious he listens," Stone says. "On a one-on-one basis, he's easy 
to like." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Todd Whitman, the GOP candidate who hopes to unseat him in November, 
has criticized Bradley for endorsing proposed campaign-spending reform 
legislation when his own campaign kitty is way above the $5.5-million limit 
that would apply in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bradley bemoans being forced to spend so much to buy television 
time in the expensive New York and Philadelphia media markets because New 
Jersey has none of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"You end up being collectors for television," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But he says he needs to raise the money to fend off any possible negative GOP 
campaign. The cautious nature is part of Bradley's style. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two years he also has been playing in national political circles, 
Hodes notes. He has spent countless hours jetting to podiums around the country 
on behalf of campaigning colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember the early endorsement of Michael Dukakis, at a very critical time for 
Dukakis; the decision to back Ron Brown for Democratic National Committee 
chairman. New Jersey was a swing seat for Brown and Bradley endorsed him," 
Hodes says. 
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, Bradley has quietly been learning about issues outside 
New Jersey. For example, although New Jersey has a strong agriculture industry, 
the senator made several visits to a South Dakota wheat farm to study another 
region's farm problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back over time," Bradley says. "I have to physically experience things; 
it's not enough for me to read the book."

EXPERT SAYS PLATYPUS FACES EXTINCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TANYA WILLMER, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MT. ISA, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fossils found at one of the world's richest archeological sites have led 
scientists to fear for the survival of the platypus, a furry mammal with webbed 
feet, a beaver-like tail and a ducklike bill. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Archer, one of the scientists who discovered the fossil site in 
northwestern Queensland, believes the platypus may be on the same evolutionary 
path as the extinct Tasmanian tiger. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be delighted if it survives 1,000 years, but I would be surprised if 
it lasts 100," said Archer, professor of zoology at the University of New South 
Wales. 
</P>
<P>
Archer bases his theory on information gleaned from 25-million-year-old fossils 
of the platypus's ancestor, the obdurodon, which were found at Riversleigh, a 
huge cattle station in the parched savannah below the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very important find because it was instrumental in telling us that 
the platypus is in evolutionary trouble," Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
He explained that the platypus that inhabited the lush tropical forests of 
Australia millions of years ago had many advantages over its modern descendant. 
Over time, the platypus has become smaller, less versatile and less able to 
ward off predators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to have a huge set of teeth, it was much bigger and inhabited about 
half the continent," Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers that remain are impossible to determine, but the platypus has 
disappeared from South Australia, where it was common 100 years ago, said 
Dominic Fanning, a research fellow at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the (toothless) platypus only exists on the eastern river systems," Archer 
said. "It has become too specialized, less able to adapt to the changing 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Riversleigh, 160 miles northwest of Mt. Isa, an old mining town, has been 
recognized as one of the world's richest fossil deposits, yielding perfect 
bones, teeth, skulls and sometimes entire skeletons of creatures that roamed 
the continent 25 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since full-scale exploration began at the site in 1983, paleontologists have 
unearthed at least 200 new fossil species embedded in the hard limestone. 
</P>
<P>
"Riversleigh has given us a unique picture of about 25 million years of 
Australian life," Archer said. "It was our first glimpse of paleontological 
paradise." 
</P>
<P>
Using explosives, crowbars and sledgehammers, the scientists have uncovered 
relics of meat-eating kangaroos, tiny koalas, marsupial lions, insects, bats 
and a giant 25-foot python, which they have named Montypythonoides. 
</P>
<P>
Archer and his colleagues return to the site once a year to dig for fossils. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we go, we find something new," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1983 scientists knew of fewer than 70 Australian land mammals older than 
2 million years, Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Riversleigh deposits -- the exact locations of which are kept 
secret to guard against scavengers -- have turned up more than 200. 
</P>
<P>
"The fossils are giving us information to enable us to interpret the past and, 
hopefully, to gauge the future. It is crucial that this body of data be 
considered when conservation decisions are being made," Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
Archer still keeps a memento in his study of one potentially earth-shattering 
discovery, a well-preserved human molar embedded in rock 15 million to 20 
million years old. 
</P>
<P>
"The oldest known human fossils are about 4 to 5 million years old, so this was 
extraordinary," he said. "We were jumping with excitement." 
</P>
<P>
This "astounding paleontological discovery," Archer added, turned out to be an 
elaborate hoax by one of his colleagues, who had used all his expertise to turn 
a recently pulled wisdom tooth into a fake fossil.

SHEBAA, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On most nights, the Nightingale, the Flying Carpet and the King clamber along 
the rocky smugglers' trail in the foothills of Mt. Hermon between Lebanon, 
Syria and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying American cigarettes, Scotch whiskey and electrical appliances for 
Syria on their backs, they run the gantlet of Syrian and Israeli soldiers dug 
in along a front that threads across the snow-capped, 9,200-foot mountain. 
</P>
<P>
On the return leg, they carry diesel fuel from Iran and other goods that are 
prized in lawless Lebanon, where civil war began in 1975, and central authority 
collapsed long ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Nightingale, the Flying Carpet and the King are mules specially trained for 
the six-hour trek on and around Mt. Hermon, where the borders of Lebanon, Syria 
and Israel intersect. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their special skills, each mule is worth about $3,000, twice the 
average for a pack animal in southeast Lebanon. Those skills include 
recognizing and running from anyone in military uniform and leading pack trains 
of up to 100 mules. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a no-man's-land out there," said Adnan Daher, a 16-year-old smuggler. 
"The Israelis are on a hill to the west, the Syrians on a hill to the east, and 
Lebanon behind us." 
</P>
<P>
No accurate figures on the smuggling trade are available, but diplomats in 
Syria say it amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
Shebaa, a predominantly Sunni Muslim town in the Israeli-occupied sector of 
south Lebanon, has been a smugglers' haven for decades. The men of Shebaa have 
traditionally defied authority. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 of Shebaa's original population of 200,000 still live there, said 
Mohammed Zoheiri, a sprightly man of 90 who has been mukhtar, or mayor, for 45 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The others went to Beirut, other parts of Lebanon or the oil-rich Persian Gulf 
states because "work opportunities are scarce here," Zoheiri said while sipping 
tea with visitors. 
</P>
<P>
He said the "mulers" as he calls them, "have known no other way of making a 
living. They were born on mule back." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his 40 grandsons are muleteers, as his father was, Zoheiri said. "It's 
Shebaa's profession." 
</P>
<P>
Over the border in Syria is Sirghaya, the nerve center of Syrian smugglers, 
where half the 15,000 people live off the contraband business. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd have to arrest the whole town if they wanted to stop us," said a 
merchant in nearby Madaya, the main outlet for the smuggled goods. He was 
unwrapping high-heeled Italian shoes that had just crossed the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Although it costs money in lost tax revenue, diplomats say, the illegal trade 
also helps the troubled Syrian economy. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the U.S. Embassy in Damascus said: "The off-the-books 
economy is both a sore point and a salvation. The black market provides badly 
needed goods and in many ways keeps the economy going." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the steady flow of contraband, the planners of Syria's socialist 
economy do not have to divert precious foreign exchange for imports. President 
Hafez Assad's government generally turns a blind eye as long as the trade keeps 
to border towns. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Damascus said there is also a sizable illicit trade in goods from 
Israel through the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Iron reinforcing bars and other building materials are particularly prized in 
Syria. The U.S. Embassy report said Syrian construction workers "would be out 
of jobs but for smuggled building materials." 
</P>
<P>
Daher, the 16-year-old smuggler from Shebaa, said after a recent nocturnal 
expedition: "We provide whatever our Syrian partners demand." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Shebaa men hand over their loads to Syrian mule trains. 
</P>
<P>
Each mule carries about 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds. Each smuggler owns two 
mules and clears about $100 a week, four times the average wage in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"Syrian soldiers usually start intercepting us after the snow melts," said a 
smuggler who identified himself only as Ahmed. "We move to another unloading 
spot close to the Israeli-controlled hill. The Syrians don't go there." 
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, a Syrian customs patrol fired on a pack train from Shebaa 
and killed a mule, but the smugglers escaped with the rest of their animals. 
</P>
<P>
Shebaa smugglers have 600 to 800 mules, said Amin, a 51-year-old who has been 
in the trade since boyhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous profession, but Shebaa's smugglers rarely get killed," he 
said. "We know our way and the lead mules are well-trained." 
</P>
<P>
Most Shebaa men killed in recent years were victims of land mines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Amin said it takes up to three months to train a lead mule, which should be 
"big, strong, healthy and smart." 
</P>
<P>
A mule chosen as a leader is kept in an "isolated, dark stable without food or 
water for two days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then a man, who shouldn't be a smuggler because the mule would get used to his 
smell, goes in dressed as a soldier and beats the mule with a stick," Amin 
said. "A smuggler goes in after him and gives the mule food and water." He said 
the "soldier" fires a rifle near the mule during the beating. "The 'soldier' 
becomes the mule's enemy," he explained, "and the animal tries to escape the 
minute a soldier is seen or a bullet is fired. At this point, the mule becomes 
eligible to lead a caravan."

TEXAS BAR SERVES UP COLD BEER, SPICY FOLKLORE 
</P>

WICHITA FALLS, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no ferns, no jukebox, no carpets, no pool tables, no happy hour and 
no dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
There is no waiting room, no game room and no ladies room. 
</P>
<P>
Wooden and windowless, it could pass for a remote shack on a large Texas ranch 
or a sturdy little fortress in a frontier wilderness. Or maybe just an upscale 
outhouse. 
</P>
<P>
A wounded firefly would double the lighting. 
</P>
<P>
This is Raymond Nipper's bar. 
</P>
<P>
It's got longnecks and chicken necks, frosty mugs and sizzling ribs, fiery 
sauces and secret recipes. Signs tout armadillo burgers for $2.95 and pig lips 
for $1.95. Those are special. So are the carhops. 
</P>
<P>
Remember carhops? 
</P>
<P>
What we're talking about here is yesteryear, with a twist. Hickory-smoked 
history. A mesquite-flavored legend. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about a beer-and-barbecue pub with a strange name, a stranger 
clientele, deliciously greasy food and walls decorated with snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing but pictures and grease holding this damn place together," a 
customer grumbled one recent noontime. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about four decades of memories in a scruffy little saloon, about 
a history as rich and colorful as this rough-and-tumble city itself, about a 
service station that became a legend called P2. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. Ray Nipper's barbecue joint is named P2, or, as it is known to 
many, The Deuce. 
</P>
<P>
P2 was the second in a chain of Pioneer restaurants opened long ago by the 
McBride family of Wichita Falls and, with a certain logic, called Pioneer 2. 
Customers shortened the name to P2, and it stuck. 
</P>
<P>
The wooden frame building housed a service station in 1922. That gave way to a 
beer barn, which the McBrides leased in 1947. They later bought the place and 
made it Pioneer 2. 
</P>
<P>
It promptly became a stag bar, but not by design. 
</P>
<P>
"It just happened that way," recalled M. E. (Fat) McBride, who with his father 
and three older brothers founded the Pioneer dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody put up a sign or anything," McBride said. "But when a woman would walk 
in, the customers kinda hushed up, and she'd feel uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, the Pioneer chain numbered 11, but the P2 never quite fit the 
corporate image. So they gave it away, to the bartender. 
</P>
<P>
The bartender, "Big Jean" Woodley, sold the P2 to Nipper in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, P2 remains a brotherhood of beer, barbecue and good ol' boys. Outside, 
it's a family affair: a drive-in for mom, pop, kids and young folks on the 
prowl. 
</P>
<P>
This is a popular feeding ground for judges, lawyers, prosecutors, plumbers, 
doctors, dentists, architects, accountants, cops, millionaire oilmen, 
roughnecks, ranchers, farmers and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
They belly up to the wooden bar alongside some of the best ol' boys in West 
Texas, not the least of whom is Lloyd Ruby, the Texas Hall of Fame Indy-type 
race car driver. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a good friendly place," said Ruby, whose newspaper and magazine 
clippings are scattered liberally among the snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a redneck bar," claimed P2 regular Joe Brown. "Used to run women off. 
Don't do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there's no serious threat of female infiltration. Not many women are 
inclined to wrestle regulars for one of six bar stools or three booths that 
rival a three-humped camel for discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the carhops, the lone woman sparring with a recent daytime crowd was 
Lou Gibson. After six years tending bar for this bunch, Lou's one savvy lady. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is different," she said. "But it's a fun place, and I enjoy working 
here. Probably the nicest people in the world come in here." 
</P>
<P>
She thought about that a second, then added: "And a few others." 
</P>
<P>
The P2 has its traditions, among them the Red Draw. That's a frosty mug of beer 
and tomato juice flavored with salt and ignited with hot pepper sauce. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a little hangover thing," remembered McBride. 
</P>
<P>
Nipper himself was a P2 regular and no stranger to a Red Draw when he bought 
the place three years ago, fulfilling a desire to own a bar where he could cook 
for his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Cookin' gets in your blood," he said. "It's not a great way to make money, but 
I love it here. It's fun. Some of these people are wealthy and affluent and 
some are just plain folks like me. 
</P>
<P>
"But they're all friends." 
</P>
<P>
Nipper will tell you anything except the secrets of his smoked meats and 
homemade sauces, which are making him famous. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Cybill Shepherd persuaded Nipper to cater a party last fall for the 
cast and crew of "Texasville," the film version of Larry McMurtry's novel set 
in nearby Archer City. 
</P>
<P>
"She doubled the size of the party from 200 to 400 on the Friday night before 
the party on Sunday," Nipper laughed. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't mind. It just added to the P2 legend, like the Red Draws, the 
fiercely competitive gin rummy games, the photographs, Ruby's card tricks and 
Nipper's Christmas parties. 
</P>
<P>
For his holiday bashes, Nipper has been known to cook up venison, calf fries, 
wild pig, brisket and all the trimmings. And it's free. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the P2 legend involves a regular named Joe Hale, who once entertained 
his buddies by riding a horse into the bar. As luck would have it, the animal 
was moved by the most natural of urges, to which it responded. 
</P>
<P>
Memorably. 
</P>
<P>
So the story goes, they banished Joe for three days and his horse forever. 
</P>
<P>
"Naw," drawled a P2 regular. "They barred the horse for three days and Joe 
forever."

PENNSYLVANIA SHAD RUNS REBORN, ONE BUCKET AT A TIME; 
</P>
<P>
FISH: CUT OFF FROM ANCESTRAL SPAWNING GROUNDS BY DAMS, THEY ARE BEING SCOOPED 
UP AND RETURNED TO THE SUSQUEHANNA RIVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ENSCOE, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty years after a 55-foot high dam cut them off from their ancestral 
spawning grounds, record numbers of American shad are being returned to the 
Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, wildlife officials say. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 shad have been scooped by bucket out of the river below the 
Conowingo Dam in Maryland this spring and released about 50 miles upriver. And 
biologists predict more than 15,000 will be trapped and released by the time 
the spawning season ends in mid-June, a 90 % increase over last year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the first year of the Conowingo fish lift program, only 182 shad were 
trapped and released. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the increase over the years pales in comparison to the millions of shad 
that migrated up the Susquehanna before four new dams virtually ended the 
spring shad runs on the East Coast's longest river basin. 
</P>
<P>
The dams stretch from Conowingo north to the York Haven Dam near Harrisburg, 
Pa., and are operated by four power companies. The Holtwood Dam, built in 1910, 
limited shad runs to the lower 25 miles of the river. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, pollution was blamed for a decline in the shad population along 
the East Coast. But the runs have increased dramatically in recent years in 
rivers such as the Delaware, where water quality has improved. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, when the state of Maryland banned shad fishing, there were fewer than 
5,000 American shad in the upper basin of the Chesapeake Bay, federal Fish and 
Wildlife Service officials say. Last year there were 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
But federal and state officials agree that the costly lift program has a long 
way to go before shad are plentiful in the Susquehanna, which flows into the 
Chesapeake, and a 10-year fishing ban is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are improving steadily. We're showing a 50% per year improvement 
in stock size," said Richard St. Pierre, the Fish and Wildlife Service's 
Susquehanna River coordinator. "We're talking about a few thousand fish 
compared to millions years ago." 
</P>
<P>
St. Pierre has charted the progress of shad in the Susquehanna since the early 
1980s, when state and federal authorities began pressuring the power companies 
that own the dams to help bring back the fish. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the Holtwood, Safe Harbor and York Haven dams eventually agreed, 
among other things, to spend $3.7 million to stock shad upstream and to find 
ways to help young shad make their way downstream. 
</P>
<P>
But Philadelphia Electric Co., which has operated a fish lift at the Conowingo 
Dam since 1972, resisted pressure to build a permanent fish lift. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in December, 1986, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered 
the company to build a second lift. Construction on that facility, which will 
cost $12.5 million, began this spring. It is expected to be finished by the 
fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Electric Co. officials say the new lift will still require that 
shad be trapped and loaded into trucks, then hauled nearly 50 miles past the 
York Haven dam near Harrisburg. Once released, the shad will have more than 350 
miles of unobstructed river to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
After years of fighting the proposal, the power company has done an about-face, 
and is now vigorously working to bring back the shad, according to St. Pierre. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to be the bad guys and now they're the good guys," he said. "We 
fought them hard and bitterly but they didn't want to spend the money." 
</P>
<P>
Biologist Chris Freas, whose company, RMC Environmental Services, contracts 
with Philadelphia Electric, said the fish lift is actually like an elevator. He 
said the fish are drawn into a holding pool, lifted in a bucket and dumped into 
a sorting tank. The shad are then separated and put into transport tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Freas said the lift someday will be able to trap and transport 1.5 million shad 
and 20 million river herring. And while he is excited about the progress in 
recent years, he realizes the battle is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten thousand fish is great news but that's a long way from a restored 
population of fish," he said. "There's still a long way to go. The ultimate 
goal is to restore 3 million shad to the base of the Conowingo Dam." 
</P>
<P>
Freas noted that the recent increase in shad catches may be due in part to 
favorable river conditions, with an optimal water flow and temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have four bad years of spawning we could be back to square one," he 
said. "We can't control Mother Nature." 
</P>
<P>
St. Pierre said the Conowingo fish lift program is only a stopgap measure. He 
said for shad to flourish, the owners of the other three dams must also build 
fish lifts. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of them are working on plans to build passageways," he said. "The 
next step will be to convince them to put together a construction schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Shad will only spawn in the rivers where they were born. It is therefore 
important to establish a population of young shad in the spawning areas, said 
Art Michaels, who edits "Pennsylvania Angler," a Fish Commission publication.

SCANDAL STALKING 3 MIAMI-AREA MAYORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SEWELL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three mayors within one county have fallen under suspicion as a string of 
corruption allegations has tangled Miami-area politics. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Hialeah has been indicted on federal racketeering charges, the 
mayor of Miami Beach is under investigation after the collapse of a savings and 
loan, and three-quarters of Sweetwater's elected officials -- the mayor 
included -- face federal extortion charge. 
</P>
<P>
All three cities are in Dade County, the densely populated area of about 2 
million people that includes Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Since his appointment two years ago, U.S. Atty. Dexter Lehtinen, a former 
Republican state senator from Dade County, has made corruption in public office 
his No. 1 priority. 
</P>
<P>
Some people question his motives. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a major suspicion in this town that Dexter has politicized the U.S. 
attorney's office," said Miami attorney Jeffrey Weiner, vice president of the 
National Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The scandals in Hialeah and Miami Beach threaten the political careers of two 
Democratic stars, both coming off landslide reelections in November. 
</P>
<P>
In Hialeah, Raul Martinez, who since 1981 has been mayor of Florida's 
fifth-largest city, was indicted in April on charges of extorting nearly $1 
million in cash and real estate from developers for zoning approvals. He was 
suspended along with a city councilman who allegedly traded his vote for 
$24,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez emerged as a potential challenger to Lehtinen's wife, Ileana 
Ros-Lehtinen, in last year's U.S. House race. But he stayed out, and Ileana 
Ros-Lehtinen won the seat for the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office said Dexter Lehtinen disqualified himself from the 
investigation into Martinez, who has been under federal scrutiny for years. Two 
other council members in the city of 200,000 have pleaded guilty to federal 
charges in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
No trial date has been set for Martinez, who faces up to 180 years in prison 
and $2.25 million in fines if convicted. Martinez, 41, has denied all charges, 
and his supporters say the case is politically tainted. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami Beach, third-term Mayor Alex Daoud has not been charged but is being 
probed by federal and state authorities and by the Florida Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Among items being investigated are $35,000 Daoud received from CenTrust 
companies before the thrift was taken over by federal regulators, tens of 
thousands of dollars in renovations to his home and thousands of dollars in 
gifts from Miami Beach socialites. 
</P>
<P>
Daoud, a popular and media-conscious mayor, has become tight-lipped about his 
troubles except to make periodic denials of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
City inspectors found more than $235,000 in improvements to Daoud's Sunset 
Island home, the Miami Herald reported. Daoud lacked city permits for most of 
the work, did not pay all required fees, failed to get final inspections and,

SOUTH YEMEN'S ONLY BREWERY STAYS IN BUSINESS DESPITE ISLAMIC DISTASTE FOR 
ALCOHOL 
</P>

ADEN, South Yemen 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Arabian peninsula's only brewery clings precariously to its tradition of 
producing fine beers while all around Islamic pressure builds against alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Brewing has long been banned in South Yemen's strict northern neighbor, and 
across the Muslim world the shutters are closing on breweries established 
during colonial days. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, breweries have closed in Pakistan and Sudan. Iran lost 
six at one time, and now the pressure to adhere to Islam's proscription of 
alcohol is mounting in South Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
Workers employed at Aden's Seera Beer factory are shunned for producing 
alcohol, which is contrary to Islamic teaching. Families wash their clothes 
separately and men have trouble finding brides, according to the plant's West 
German manager, Eckhardt Zitzmann. 
</P>
<P>
"One man finally had to go to Algeria to find a wife," Zitzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
But in socialist South Yemen, the Arab world's most leftist state, not all are 
ashamed of their country's secular ways. 
</P>
<P>
"In the (Persian) Gulf, liquor is banned, but you go into people's houses there 
and you find complete bars," said one Yemeni. "Here we aren't hypocrites. If 
you want to go to a bar, you can. If you want to go a mosque, you can." 
</P>
<P>
Zitzmann said Seera is the impoverished government's No. 1 revenue earner, with 
beer taxed a thumping 600%. A bottle costs about $3. 
</P>
<P>
Average consumption is only about three or four quarts per person per year, but 
in Aden, the capital, it is much higher. Zitzmann said the quality of his beer 
matches American and European standards. 
</P>
<P>
Yemenis drink mainly at night at small bars away from residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
In some neighborhoods they buy beer from small openings in walls through which 
the seller can scarcely be seen, then sit on the ground in circles of friends, 
far from the disapproving eyes of their wives. 
</P>
<P>
Yemenis chew qat, a leaf containing a mild stimulant, while drinking beer, 
which enhances the effect. In South Yemen qat is permitted only on non-work 
days -- Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say there is increasing pressure, if indirect, from Saudi Arabia and 
North Yemen to close the brewery. 
</P>
<P>
Zitzmann was a brewer in Iran before and after the 1979 Islamic revolution. As 
other breweries closed, he switched to non-alcoholic beer, then came to Aden to 
help start up the Seera factory in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He said the plant plans to begin exporting its beer and is preparing a 
non-alcoholic version as well.

Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari arrived Saturday for a five-day 
visit to finalize three Japanese aid projects that will help combat Mexico's 
severe air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said Japan would provide $780 million for the projects. 
Mexico has planned to promote the use of unleaded gasoline and the 
desulphurization of heavy crude oil and diesel oils. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mexico asked Japan and the United States, among other industrial 
nations and international groups, to help finance 26 projects to fight air 
pollution in Mexico City, which is among the worst in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas will meet Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and Emperor Akihito on Monday.

POLICE HIT WITH ROCKS AFTER CLOSING CLUB

Hundreds of people angered by the closing of a crowded Latino social club 
pelted police with rocks and bottles early Saturday during a window-smashing 
rampage that took three hours to quell. 
</P>
<P>
Police asked owners of the members-only Quisquellano Lounge to clear out an 
estimated 250 patrons about midnight after an officer saw a window break, Lt. 
Joseph Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unsafe and overcrowded," Rowe said, adding there was no official 
occupancy limit. "After several requests were made both in English and in 
Spanish directing everyone to leave the area, people refused to leave . . . and 
a kind of mob psychology took over." 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements were called in to help control the crowd that swelled to about 
500 and flooded the streets surrounding the Boston suburb's central square. 
</P>
<P>
"They eventually blocked the entire street. When the first arrest was made, the 
crowd turned on the officers and pelted them with bottles and stones," he said, 
adding that fights broke out in alleys and that store windows were smashed. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen people were arrested, most for investigation of disorderly conduct or 
failure to disperse. All face arraignment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe said no injuries were reported and the disturbance stopped short of 
becoming a riot because police "showed restraint . . . (and) did not attack the 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Ortiz, secretary at the club where owners have applied for a nightclub 
license, said it has no liquor license and serves only soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had any trouble here in 15 years," he said in a telephone 
interview from the club. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe said he did not know whether alcohol was being served at the lounge, but 
"certainly people were under the influence."

YELLOW DEATH STALKS FLORIDA COCONUT PALMS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: AN INSECT-CARRIED LETHAL DISEASE IS SPREADING ACROSS THE STATE.

Victor Yingst is on the trail of a killer on Florida's palm-shaded Gulf coast. 
</P>
<P>
He knows the stalker's methods by heart. 
</P>
<P>
"First the coconuts fall, then the fronds turn a bright yellow and soon the 
tree is dead," said Yingst, who has spent more than three years battling lethal 
yellowing disease for the Lee County Extension Service. 
</P>
<P>
After wiping out thousands of palms in the Caribbean and southeastern Florida, 
the infestation is spreading into one of the last untouched regions for the 
majestic Jamaican tall palm and other susceptible exotic species. 
</P>
<P>
The insect-carried disease -- moving inland from beaches -- has agriculture 
experts fearing a recurrence of the palm die-offs in southern Florida in the 
1970s. Tourism officials worry about a change in the tropical appeal of 
southeastern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Lethal yellowing is sort of like a fire," Yingst said. "If left unchecked, it 
will spread farther and farther. It could really rob this area of its special 
beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Although lethal yellowing has been studied for nearly 100 years, there is no 
known cure. But recently tree inoculations and plantings of resistant palms 
have helped somewhat to contain the disease, caused by a cellular organism 
called mycoplasmas that lives on the palm fronds' soft core. 
</P>
<P>
Trees usually die within three to six months after the first symptoms appear. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest known reference to a coconut tree disorder was made in 1834 on 
Grand Cayman Island. By the late 19th Century, scientists were examining lethal 
yellowing in Jamaica, where the coconut crop was a valuable export. 
</P>
<P>
Lethal yellowing jumped over to the Florida Keys in the 1950s and moved onto 
the mainland near Miami in 1971. Currently, the disease has claimed about 
200,000 coconut palms and nearly 100,000 other species in Florida as far north 
as Jupiter, about 80 miles from Miami, according to the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, lethal yellowing has spread to date palms, creating concern in the 
date-growing regions of Arizona and California. Overseas, the disease ranges 
from West Africa across the Caribbean to Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're left with is a trunk -- like a telephone pole -- that just rots 
until it eventually falls over. It's really ugly," Yingst said. 
</P>
<P>
As head of the Lee County lethal yellowing control effort, Yingst has organized 
groups of residents and landscapers to monitor its progress and inject healthy 
trees with a tetracycline-based antibiotic. Also, resistant palms such as the 
popular malayan dwarf variety are being planted around healthy coconut palms as 
a buffer. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Marinello, who operates a landscaping service, said she has inoculated 
about 1,300 trees in Ft. Myers and Ft. Myers Beach, where the disease was first 
spotted on the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"To see a picture of what this place looked like two years ago and what it 
looks like now would shock you," she said. "It's a serious problem that could 
really change the character of this place if it's not stopped."

GORBYMANIA GETS ALL DOLLED UP

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may face opposition at home, but to the 
Japanese he is fast becoming an idol. 
</P>
<P>
Polls indicate that Gorbachev is one of the most popular figures in Japan, 
where he has inspired a craze for Soviet-related goods such as the "Gorby 
Doll," books about what used to be called the East Bloc and even Soviet 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"We are amazed by this great reaction," said Tomoki Kajiwara, sales manager at 
Tokyo doll maker Avanti Ltd., which has just launched a Gorbachev doll priced 
at $25. 
</P>
<P>
Kajiwara said his company would have to make 250,000 to 300,000 copies of the 
unclothed 10-inch-high figures to satisfy initial demand which, he said, was 
"highly unusual" in the doll business. 
</P>
<P>
"His face is quite identical" to the real Gorbachev, Kajiwara said. "The doll 
even makes sounds, though not in Russian." 
</P>
<P>
Kajiwara said his company had received inquiries about the doll from more than 
10 countries. Avanti plans to sell a larger "Gorby" later. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the dolls, Japanese bookstores and travel agencies are also in the 
grip of Gorbachev fever. Many bookstores have set up special sections for 
titles on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for one leading bookseller, Sanseido Bookstore, said: "We set up 
our East Bloc corner at the best spot in our stores. The books have been 
selling like hotcakes." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's own "Perestroika" is selling heavily despite the fact that the book 
came out three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Books and magazines focusing on Communist countries, their leaders and people 
in the regions have been selling well," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to five years ago, Japanese taste for books has totally changed. . . 
. Now so many Japanese are interested in books about the Soviet leader and East 
Bloc nations," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is another business sector to benefit from the Gorbachev effect. 
</P>
<P>
Tours to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union used to be one of the least 
popular lines for Japanese travel agencies, but travelers' preferences have 
changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time I have seen such a fever in tours to Eastern Europe in my 
25 years in the travel business," an agency employee said. One Tokyo agency has 
already sold out 15 tours scheduled for May. 
</P>
<P>
"Many are interested in the Berlin Wall, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and, of 
course, the Soviet Union," a travel agency employee said. 
</P>
<P>
"We should say thank you to Gorbachev for expanding our markets. Without his 
new policy, we could not have grown in the Eastern Europe markets. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to say only a strange type of people visit Moscow, but now we say, if 
you are not interested in going to Moscow, you're abnormal."

Sheriff's homicide detectives late Saturday were searching for the ex-boyfriend 
of a young woman who was found dead along with her mother in the trunk of a 
family car at their home in a secluded equestrian section of Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
A Sheriff's Department spokesman said Robert Greig found the bodies of his 
wife, Rose, 53, and daughter, Melitta, 22, after returning from work to the 
family home in the 400 block of South Camino de Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators late Saturday found Melitta's gray 1989 Volkswagen Cabriolet 
convertible. The car with its personalized license plate ATTILEM (Melitta 
spelled backward), behind a Motel 6 near the Pomona Freeway in Rowland Heights 
shortly after 8 p.m. Authorities declined to relese further details about the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues and friends had searched for Rose Greig when she failed to return 
after abruptly leaving St. Martha's Church in La Puente after receiving a phone 
call about 12:15 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent calls to relatives and neighbors failed to find her, said Father Bill 
Leser, pastor of St. Martha's, where Rose Greig worked as Leser's secretary and 
parish bookkeeper. Leser said he believed that Melitta had called her away. 
"She said she'd be right back," he added. 
</P>
<P>
If there was a problem at home, "Rose would have gone and solved it. She was 
that type of mother," Leser said. "She was a mother bear that would just jump 
into a problem and solve it. She was a very loving, very caring person. 
Unflappable." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her regular duties, she was bookkeeper of the church's effort to 
organize a new parish in Walnut. She handled books for her husband's business, 
a lunch truck that catered to farm workers. She also spent hours each week 
helping her elderly mother and father, who live in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Melitta's failure to appear for her 4 p.m. shift at the Fullerton movie theater 
prompted her employer and friends to search for her as well. Montoya said his 
wife, Linda, visited the home at Leser's request and found no sign of mother or 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
When Robert Greig arrived home from work after midnight, a neighbor told him 
that his wife and daughter appeared to be missing, friends said. Attempts to 
reach Greig earlier in the day were unsuccessful, Leser said. 
</P>
<P>
After searching the home, investigators said, Greig entered the garage, noticed 
several blood spots at the rear of the family car and opened the trunk. 
Sheriff's investigators said the women had been bludgeoned. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in shock, his face drained of blood," Montoya said of Greig. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the murders took place in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya described his neighborhood as close-knit. 
</P>
<P>
With their secluded private drive and shared interest in horses, "we're not 
like a normal neighborhood. We're more like a family," Montoya said. "We're all 
up here, we're all scared. We all want to know why. It's without reason. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a random thing, then it's scary. You don't know if it's going to 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Leser described the staff at St. Martha's as a family. 
</P>
<P>
"Today," he said, "everybody's just sitting around crying."

That wasn't exactly a red carpet that was rolled out for visitor Opal Cronk 
when she set foot in Los Angeles the other day. 
</P>
<P>
It was a human tide of street people that surged toward the frightened Morro 
Bay grandmother after she stepped from the bus and claimed her luggage at the 
downtown Greyhound station. 
</P>
<P>
Sidewalks outside the bus terminal were crowded with a ragtag collection of men 
hustling drugs, begging for spare change and soliciting "jobs," like carrying 
new arrivals' bags. 
</P>
<P>
Cronk took one look and retreated into the station to wait for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't come for my grandson's high school graduation in Fountain Valley, 
I'd turn around and go back home," she shuddered. "This is real scary. We don't 
have all of this around where I live." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Most cities do not greet visitors by giving them the bum's rush. But that's 
what the 350,000 travelers who will pass through Los Angeles' main bus station 
this summer can anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old terminal is located near the center of the city's Skid Row, 
where growing numbers of homeless and derelicts congregate around soup 
kitchens, flophouses and voucher hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Although bus stations throughout urban America generally are located in less 
than upscale neighborhoods, officials say conditions around the Los Angeles 
terminal are more intense than elsewhere. Most tourists coming to Los Angeles 
avoid the experience by arriving in their cars or at airports. 
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating neighborhood around the bus station is sending Greyhound 
executives scrambling to find a safer place in the metropolitan area to 
relocate their bus depot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's darn scary here, no question about it," said Robert Bonds, Greyhound's 
Los Angeles terminal manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked outside once at 7 o'clock at night. I won't do it again. My advice to 
passengers is, if you go outside those front doors, be real careful. My concern 
is passengers' safety." 
</P>
<P>
The situation prompted a handful of street people two months ago to launch a 
self-styled cleanup campaign outside the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The transients' do-it-yourself crackdown on loitering and panhandling at the 
terminal is being led by Jerry Lafayette, who describes himself as a homeless 
ex-drug addict. He says his concern is financial. 
</P>
<P>
There is money to be made by helping bus passengers carry their bags and hail 
taxis, Lafayette said. As much as $150 a day can be earned in tips from 
travelers and taxi and shuttle operators. 
</P>
<P>
But those who pounce on travelers spoil it for everybody, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If 10 guys run to a cab when it pulls up out here to wash windows and grab 
bags, you scare everybody, even the driver," said Lafayette, a 37-year-old 
former courier service employee. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is trying to chase away drug addicts who hang around the depot and 
pester travelers for cash to spend on rock cocaine from Skid Row dealers. He is 
urging those who want to work outside the bus station to wear clean clothes and 
to take turns approaching travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Results have been mixed. Lafayette said he has recruited six former addicts to 
work in such a semi-organized manner. But dozens of other homeless men ignore 
the blunt-spoken Lafayette's harangues and continue to loiter at the depot 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Two visitors from Sonora, Mexico, Elizabeth Siller and Maria Gonzales, seemed 
dazed by the scene as strangers moved in on them from all sides near the bus 
station doorway last week. 
</P>
<P>
Several offered to help the women with their luggage. One persistently tried to 
persuade them to take an unlicensed "bandit van" to their destination. Another 
peddled phony gold jewelry, waving a necklace in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
"Your first impression of L.A. when you get off the bus here is, 'Oh my God -- 
what have I come to?' " said Harold Patton, 39, who said he is a recovering 
cocaine addict who has joined in the self-policing effort. 
</P>
<P>
The bus terminal's rough neighborhood works to the hustlers' advantage, 
Lafayette admitted. But sometimes it is hard to distinguish the self-appointed 
crew trying to police the depot from the street hustlers who are frightening 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Turning toward travelers leaving the station, Lafayette shouted: "Welcome to 
L.A! You are in the heart of Skid Row! You go one block this way or one block 
that way, anything can happen! I will be your personal security! I will escort 
you safely to your car!" 
</P>
<P>
Such an exhortation "borders on extortion" in the view of Los Angeles Police 
Capt. Jerry W. Conner, commander of the city's Central Area police division. 
Conner's office is in a bunker-like, brick police station located a few hundred 
yards from the entrance to the bus terminal.

<P>
Conner acknowledged that visitors "are totally vulnerable" when they step from 
the Greyhound depot. Although specific figures are unavailable, incidents of 
theft, assault and robbery in the area are common, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bus station is the port of entry for a lot of people, and for them to be 
confronted by what you see out there just drives me up the wall," Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
"It embarrasses me because you're right across the street from the Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
Police are prevented from clearing the bus station sidewalk because Greyhound 
does not own the walkway area next to the terminal, Conner said. Greyhound 
built the two-story depot in 1967, but sold the building four years ago to an 
investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
The bus company leases the second floor as a passenger lounge and ticketing and 
boarding area. The first floor is rented as a mini-mall to shopkeepers who sell 
souvenirs and other tourist items. 
</P>
<P>
Off-duty policemen hired as security guards by Greyhound are posted at two 
places on the second floor to keep street people out of passenger areas. But 
access to the first-floor mall -- used by all passengers -- is not restricted. 
</P>
<P>
When police patrol the public sidewalk outside the terminal, transients and 
beggars simply step back a few feet onto private property, Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound officials say they are ready to pack up their buses and move. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent today looking around for any place that has the space we need," Enzo 
Orlando, the company's area general manager, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando said Greyhound needs at least an acre for a new terminal. He said he 
would prefer to stay close to the downtown area because of its central 
location. 
</P>
<P>
"My druthers would be to cozy up to the Amtrak facilities over by Union 
Station," he said. "With Metro Rail coming in, that will be a transportation 
center. We're talking with them about it." 
</P>
<P>
The strike by union bus drivers, which began March 2, has had little effect on 
the street scene outside the terminal. But bus riders all over the country are 
talking with Greyhound about the problems at the Los Angeles depot. 
</P>
<P>
Terminal manager Bonds said he often heard from worried passengers in Eugene, 
Ore., where he was assigned until March 6. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd say, 'If you have to route me through L.A., I won't go.' "

40 CONDOS GUTTED IN SUSPICIOUS $6-MILLION BLAZE; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE: FORTY OTHER UNITS ARE HEAVILY DAMAGED. OFFICIALS ARE INVESTIGATING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ARSON.

<P>
A fire destroyed 40 condominium units under construction in Lancaster on 
Saturday and heavily damaged at least 40 other units in a $6-million blaze that 
Los Angeles County fire officials described as suspicious in origin. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze erupted at 2:45 p.m. in a 130-unit development in the rapidly growing 
Antelope Valley city. Smoke billowing two miles high drew hundreds of 
spectators, temporarily blocking firefighters' access to the site at 30th 
Street West and Avenue K-4, Fire Department spokesman Robert Serabia said. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 firefighters, assisted by two water-dropping helicopters, battled the 
fire for 90 minutes before bringing it under control, Serabia said. Five 
firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion. No other injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the fire from all over the valley, and people were driving that 
far," Serabia said. "I was in a traffic jam trying to get to the fire." 
</P>
<P>
The fire, in the Marbella Villas development, engulfed 20 two-story buildings 
with four units each, Serabia said. Embers ignited a quarter-acre of grass 
across the street and sparked small fires on a roof and in an attic about one 
mile away, officials said. Those fires were quickly extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department spokesman Don Kanallakan said firefighters' efforts were 
hampered by wind gusts of up to 35 m.p.h. and 85-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
Kanallakan added that investigators were having difficulty pinpointing the 
fire's origin because of the project's size. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials were investigating the possibility of arson because the first 
flames spread rapidly through dozens of units and because there were no 
construction workers present who might have set the fire inadvertently. The 
cause of the fire had not been determined Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The destroyed condominiums were about 50% complete, Serabia said. Firefighters 
were able to save about 50 nearly completed units, valued at about $3 million, 
Kanallakan said. The scheduled opening of those units next month may be delayed 
until the Fire Department completes a structural inspection, Serabia said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was similar to three fires that caused damage of more than $3 million 
to 45 houses under construction in Palmdale and Quartz Hill last August and 
September. Officials said that those fires appeared to have been accidental, in 
one instance caused by a plumber's torch. 
</P>
<P>
The condominium project is being developed by Hamdan Associates, based in 
Century City, Serabia said. Developer Khalil Hamdan, who was at the project 
inspecting the damage Saturday afternoon, declined to comment.

4 SMUGGLING SUSPECTS SEIZED, 15 ALIENS FREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four suspected smugglers of illegal immigrants were arrested early Saturday and 
15 of their victims were freed, including a 9-year-old girl and a Guatemalan 
man who was kidnapped in Mexico and brought to California, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Carrillo, 27, had been kidnapped from a Tijuana alley Friday, put in a 
small van, brought to Maywood and held for $350 ransom, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Police Sgt. William Talbott said he arrested two of the suspected 
kidnapers when he accompanied Carrillo's sister to a ransom drop at a Bell 
fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Police traced a telephone number the kidnapers earlier gave to Carrillo's 
family and raided a house in the 6100 block of Pala Avenue in Maywood about 
12:30 a.m. Saturday, finding the 14 others held captive, including the 
9-year-old girl, the niece of one of the men, Talbott said. 
</P>
<P>
Two more suspected smugglers were arrested at the house.

CHANCE TO SEE THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF 'OZ'; 
</P>
<P>
THE 'ROAD TO OZ' DISPLAY AT THE FRANCES HOWARD GOLDWYN BRANCH LIBRARY IN 
HOLLYWOOD ACQUAINTS VISITORS WITH THE LIFE AND WORKS OF AUTHOR L. FRANK BAUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood seems an indelicate place to house a history of something as sweet as 
the works of L. Frank Baum. The neighborhood of the handsome Frances Howard 
Goldwyn branch of the Los Angeles Public Library, where "The Road to Oz: The 
Life of L. Frank Baum" is on display, is pretty well inhabited by the same 
types of struggling souls regularly seen sleeping on the stars of nearby 
Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, in a way, it would seem inappropriate to place such an exhibit 
anywhere else. Baum, after all, spent the last 10 years of his life in 
Hollywood, at a beloved home he called "Ozcot." Hollywood itself is nearly as 
much of a myth as Oz is, and as for struggling souls, well, Baum -- prolific 
author, newspaper editor, salesman of axle grease and castor oil, motion 
picture studio head, lifelong victim of a frail heart -- knew his share of 
bankruptcy and strife. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody really knows very much about Frank Baum," said exhibit director-curator 
Carroll Hodge, a free-lance documentary filmmaker and member of the film school 
faculty at USC. "In fact, I didn't really know who Frank Baum was. I did not 
read the Oz books when I was a child. I discovered them in doing this project." 
</P>
<P>
Hodge is an exemplary case of what she hopes will happen to everyone who tours 
the Baum exhibit (running through Aug. 31) -- that they will come to understand 
that Lyman Frank Baum was not, as popular assumption goes, just a nice old 
fellow who wrote a children's story. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that the books were quite a bit different from the 1939 film," said 
Hodge, who was charged to assemble the exhibit by the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation 
as part of an ongoing effort to honor writers who lived in Los Angeles ("And," 
said senior librarian John Holliman, "to promote reading!") "I found that Frank 
Baum's stories had a sly humor and the whole philosophical bent of not giving 
too much power away. I thought that was very contemporary. We all go looking 
for the wizard, and when he's a humbug, he reminds us that we already had that 
power within us. I like Baum's very full, coherent philosophy, and it's played 
out in wonderful characters, and that appealed to me a lot as an adult." 
</P>
<P>
The wonderful characters are all at the exhibit in the form of charming, 
life-sized cutout paintings done by designer Deni Wohlgemuth Ponty. Upstairs, 
General Jinjur -- Baum's parody of a suffragist (the author favored equality 
for women, but could not suffer any form of militancy -- watches over a portion 
of the children's section. Prof. H.M. (Highly Magnified) Wogglebug, T.E. 
(Thoroughly Educated) -- Baum's sendup of academic snobbery -- stands pompously 
near a Rand McNally Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide. Downstairs, entrants 
are greeted with an imitation "Yellow Brick Road," one of Oz's crabby apple 
trees, the Cowardly Lion, "the Most Intelligent Beast in Oz;" the Tin Woodman, 
"the Kindliest Man in Oz"; the Scarecrow, "the Wisest Man in All of Oz"; and 
other faces familiar in the Emerald City -- notably, of course, that of Dorothy 
Gale, stalwart survivor of cyclones and witches' spells. 
</P>
<P>
"I have several theories as to why Baum had a girl for a central character in 
the Oz books," said Hodge, "but it probably would be safe to say that he always 
wanted a little girl and didn't have one. I think he created a girl character 
who appealed to boys also; a girl heroine who was adventuresome and courageous 
and yet girlish. What did she want? She wanted to go home. And also on the 
subject of heroines, not only is Dorothy an important character, but all the 
rulers of Oz are women. Once the wizard is sort of dethroned, Ozma and Glinda 
the Good Witch take over." 
</P>
<P>
The "Road" in "The Road to Oz" is a well-researched, detailed time line history 
of Baum's life, complete with mementos and photos (provided by Baum descendants 
and Oz devotees). Visitors are invited to follow the author's career in 19 
stops throughout the library, punctuated by more of Ponty's renderings of the 
various citizens of Munchkinland and Winkie Country. "I was surprised," Hodge 
said, "at how many people stop to read every word." 
</P>
<P>
A 25-minute video documentary featuring choice samplings of Baum's own highly 
surreal movie versions of his stories, done in 1914 by his Oz Film 
Manufacturing Co., runs continuously downstairs, with narration by admitted 
Oz-buff Charlton Heston. Norman Rockwell's painting of Judy Garland as Dorothy, 
commissioned by Gregory Peck, hangs on an upstairs wall; a replica of a 1914 
toy Woozy, a magical wooden beast, made by Baum's great-grandson, Robert, is 
encased in glass; a stubby old pencil mounted and framed is captioned in Baum's 
own script, "With this pencil, I wrote the Ms. of 'The Emerald City' (later 
changed to "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"), Oct. 9, 1899." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the humble pencil that yielded what many say is America's greatest 
fairy tale, perhaps two other features of the exhibit stand out most; one, an 
excerpted letter in which author John Steinbeck asks President Kennedy if he 
could be appointed U.S. Ambassador to Oz ("There is only one great danger that 
I can think of," wrote Steinbeck. "In Oz they have a wizard who openly admits 
that he is a fake. Can you think what that principle would do to New York 
politics alone?") and two, "the Gump." Right, the sofa-bed-and-elk's-head 
creature that, after a sprinkling of the Magic Powder of Life, spirited the 
Scarecrow and his companions away from the clutches of General Jinjur. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the exhibit's physical objects that I am actually most fond of is the 
Gump," Hodge said. "There's a little story by a Baum niece that when she stayed 
overnight with her Uncle Frank and Aunt Maud, they pushed the couch to the 
wall, and made a little bed for her, and it was very much in the spirit of fun 
kids have always had in pushing furniture together and making something 
imaginative from it. I feel like that Gump couch (upstairs in the children's 
section) is kind of a physical 3-D element that lets kids connect with Frank 
Baum's imagination on a very immediate kind of way. They can climb in and read 
books, and they can enjoy the fact that the Gump was a character that came to 
life. And if they want to imagine they can fly away in it, that would be fine, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
There were times in Baum's own life when he perhaps wished to fly away on a 
magic couch -- perhaps, most surprisingly, to escape from Oz itself. A 
compulsive writer of more than 60 books -- including many adventure tales 
written under pen names such as Capt. Hugh Fitzgerald and Suzanne Metcalf -- he 
tried to end the Oz series with "The Emerald City" in 1910 (he made the place 
invisible to the outside world). He vowed to not pen another word about Oz 
until "a thousand little children write a thousand little letters." Within a 
few months, they had, and Baum was to grind out eight more adventures in the 
"merry old land" before his death in 1919. One of the post-"thousand little 
letter" books was "The Patchwork Girl of Oz" -- which happens to be the 
favorite Oz work of Baum's only living grandchild, Ozma Baum Mantele. 
</P>
<P>
"Patchwork Girl" appealed to me so much that I changed my name to Scraps, and 
everybody started calling me Scraps," said Mantele, speaking from her home in 
Downey. "With my name, Ozma, I never knew who were my friends and who weren't. 
I had a hard time with my name when I was younger." 
</P>
<P>
Named after the gentle princess of Oz, Mantele was cherished by Baum, the 
father of four sons. Her memories of grandfather consist only of "flashes" from 
the age of 3, but to this day she wears a diamond and gold locket inscribed 
with her name presented by her grandfather upon her birth. She does have 
favorite Baum tales, though, passed down by her grandmother, Maud Gage Baum. 
Among them: that Baum was especially proud of a letter from a New York polio 
clinic saying that his books went hand-in-hand with a thermometer; that once a 
child touched him because "he wanted to know what the wizard felt like"; and, 
while visiting Egypt, he was deeply moved by a little girl who, while moving to 
Cairo with her family, had crossed the desert on camelback with only a doll and 
an Oz book -- which he promptly autographed. Mantele, who helped Hodge with 
research, heartily approves of "The Road to Oz." 
</P>
<P>
"I like this exhibit because it shows that he was very multitalented and wrote 
many more things besides the 'Wizard,' " said Mantele, who has long given slide 
presentations on her grandfather's life. "He was very multifaceted, actually. 
And he also raised chrysanthemums, and got cups for those -- anything he put 
his hand to, he could do. And I also like the video with Heston's narration 
because it showed my grandfather's studio, and all the innovations. He was way 
ahead of his time as far as motion picture special effects are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, "The Patchwork Girl of Oz" movie from 1914 -- clips of which may be 
seen in Hodge's video -- includes underwater effects, flying scenes and a 
startling moment in which Mombi the Witch is temporarily beheaded. Among Baum's 
other multitudinous facets: publishing the Saturday Pioneer newspaper in South 
Dakota in 1890, where he first made his mark as a satirist; touring as a 
Shakespearean actor in 1881 under the name of George Brooks; receiving national 
acclaim for his play, "The Maid of Arran" in 1882; selling axle grease and 
castor oil in 1891 to bring in money after his first of several bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
"This man had struggled for years to get published -- maybe five years, or so," 
Hodge said. "And how often he went bankrupt, or his publishers went bankrupt, 
or his film company went bankrupt! He weathered many hard times -- he had a 
heart attack at the age of 12 -- and I think he had a certain buoyancy, and a 
certain outlook on life that just kept him going." 
</P>
<P>
To say nothing of a certain place.

VOODOO, THE CARIBBEAN, CALYPSO AND A HINT OF MOLIERE IN 'DE OBEAH MON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's a mystical, magical, Caribbean musical-comedy farce," said Charles 
Douglass, describing his "De Obeah Mon," which opens Saturday at the Westwood 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Like its closest literary relation, Moliere's "The Doctor in Spite of Himself," 
Douglass' play features feuding spouses, rich suitors, obstinate brides and 
reluctant medical practitioners. This time, though, the action takes place on 
the mythical island of Khakikotonga; the medicine men are voodoo doctors (obeah 
means witchcraft), and the musical style ranges from calypso and reggae to 
jazz, blues and down-home gospel. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass, whose local stage appearances include "Lena Horne: the Lady and Her 
Music" (Pantages, 1982) and "Sweet Bird of Youth" (Ahmanson, 1988), began 
acting at age 12 in the Germantown, Pa., community theater. One of the plays 
the company performed over and over was "The Doctor in Spite of Himself." Years 
later, when a girlfriend introduced Douglass to her Caribbean culture, the 
memories of Moliere kept tugging. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, "De Obeah Mon" was done in a workshop in New York at Westside Arts 
Theatre and Actors Studio. In 1987, it migrated to Hollywood for a run at the 
Gene Dynarski Theatre; last April came a brief stint at the Wilshire Ebell. 
Last year, the show won four NAACP Image Awards -- for best Equity-waiver play, 
writing (Douglass), actress (Delores Hall) and costume design (Samuel P. Barton 
and Ron Cremers). 
</P>
<P>
Yet the path to the Westwood hasn't been easy. Lots of backers' auditions, lots 
of deals fallen through, lots of skepticism. "When Charles first said he was 
doing a calypso musical, I told him that wasn't my style," recalled Jimmy 
Justice, who shares credits with Douglass for the musical score and who also 
plays the title role. "I said, 'I'm opera-trained. I like jazz, blues.' He 
said, 'Why don't you be eclectic? We'll work something out. Only thing is, it's 
got to have an island feel.' " 
</P>
<P>
The production is equally eclectic in its makeup: from Douglass (who has 
appeared on Broadway in "Over Here," "The Wiz" and "Eubie") and the 
piano-playing Justice to Tony-winning actress Hall, choreographer/director 
Stephen Semien, supervising producer Anthony B. Major ("Super Spook") and 
executive producer Henry Lawrence, a former Los Angeles Raider. 
</P>
<P>
Without causing too much confusion, the plot goes something like this: 
Bougainvillea, the beautiful young daughter of the village aristocrat, is 
engaged to marry a man she does not love, and so feigns an illness rendering 
her speechless. The faux Obeah Man -- whom, his wife proclaims, is an MD, Ph.D, 
DWD (Doctor of witch doctors) and a DOD (Doctor of de obeah doctors) -- is 
brought in to cure Bougainvillea. "It's very lightweight," Douglass said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Although he'd originally planned to star in the piece himself, Douglass has his 
hands full as writer and co-producer. "I can't wear that many hats," he said 
with a shrug. "I've seen enough plays where the writer is the director, star, 
producer -- and you do lose some objectivity. I don't think I'm strong enough 
to handle that dynamic. But I've been in the theater long enough to be able to 
give leeway to my directors. I've also gotten too old to play the part." 
</P>
<P>
"De Obeah Mon" 
</P>
<P>
At the Westwood Playhouse, 10886 Le Conte Ave., in the Contempo Westwood 
Center. For reservations, (213) 208-5454. 
</P>
<P>
Opens Saturday and plays at 8 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays and at 2:30 and 
7:30 p.m. Sundays, to July 21. Tickets are $22 and $27.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: SELF-TAUGHT GUITARIST SCOTT HUCKABAY TO STRUM HIS ACOUSTIC 
STUFF AT BEBOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Huckabay was no child phenom. He didn't even pick up a guitar until he 
finished playing with adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hanging around in the basement, when I found this old, thick Spanish 
guitar," said Huckabay, who was 17 at the time. "It suddenly became part of me, 
and I couldn't put it down. I found my thing." 
</P>
<P>
Today, his thing has landed him recognition -- he placed second recently in BAM 
magazine's vote for guitarist of the year. On Thursday, Huckabay, 25, will 
strum his stuff at BeBop Records in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Huckabay, who lives in San Clemente, has never taken a lesson. Since his 
basement discovery, he taught himself everything, graduating from the Spanish 
instrument to an electric guitar to his current acoustic version. After a 
motorcycle accident in Arizona, he used his recuperation period to jam with his 
acoustic guitar. He sees it as his best chance for a career breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much competition in the electric, heavy-metal scene," Huckabay 
said. "But it's still an open market for acoustic players." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Huckabay has only performed instrumental songs; he released a tape on 
his own label, Fresh Ltd. He's written lyrics, but has hesitated to sing them 
at concerts. "I just don't feel I've progressed to that level yet. It will come 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
At BeBop, he will stick to the acoustic guitar. He will also put together a 
light show. "I was never really into rock 'n' roll as a kid," he said. "I'm 
much more into jazz and classical." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Huckabay will play his acoustic guitar at 8 p.m. Thursday, at BeBop 
Records, 18433 Sherman Way, Reseda. Donations are requested. For information, 
call (818) 881-1654.

Summer in Santa Monica once again means the outdoor concert series, "Grand 
Summer Nights," which will open July 1 with a country-Western theme. Glen 
Campbell is the featured guest. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-concert series, sponsored by Santa Monica College, will present jazz, 
mariachi and acoustic music. Among the performers will be the Oak Ridge Boys on 
July 15 and Lionel Hampton on Aug. 19. For the first time in the three-year 
event, admission, ranging from $7.50 to $15, will be charged, except the July 1 
event is free. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people complained that they couldn't get in last year," said Gloria 
Mottler, the program coordinator for campus events. "When it was free, people 
would arrive very early and take all the seats." 
</P>
<P>
The July 1 show at Corsair Field will also include displays, booths, free 
children's rides and a fireworks show. Most of the concerts will take place at 
the 1,800-seat college amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Grand Summer Nights" concert series begins at 8 p.m. July 1. For 
information, call (213) 452-9209. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the eighth anniversary of the Southern California Blues Society, a 
concert will be held Saturday at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga. 
The show will feature Junior Wells, who has toured internationally for four 
decades, and Cash McCall, who has played with such artists as Muddy Waters, 
Ramsey Lewis and Etta James. 
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by Blues groups from Los Angeles. Among them will be "The 
Mighty Flyers," a modern, faster-paced music than the traditional Chicago 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to provide a full range of different blues," said Eddie Archer, the 
concert's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Celebration of the Blues," sponsored by the Southern California Blues 
Society, will take place at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga 
Canyon Blvd., Topanga, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m Saturday. Tickets are $20, $17 in 
advance. For information, call (714) 594-5051.

HYMIE'S FISH MARKET MAY LEAVE YOU GASPING FOR AIR WITH ITS HIGH PRICES, AVERAGE 
FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Hymie's Fish Market would be more impressive beside a rocky shoal in New 
England than it is in permanent Ventura Boulevard dry-dock. But then, what 
wouldn't? 
</P>
<P>
It's an artificially weather-beaten clapboard shack with blue awnings a la Old 
Cape Cod and a facade dominated by a statue of an ancient mariner. This wizened 
figure keeps a stern watch from a second floor crow's-nest; maybe someday an 
anthropologist will think he had something to do with Metro Traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Hymie's really lays it on thick. The conceit is that we're in a rustic 
seaman's cottage made of rough-hewn slats, furnished with pink tablecloths and 
wooden captain's chairs. A huge crawl space is packed with nautical artifacts: 
a rowboat here, a lobster net there, woven baskets for the daily catch. A fake 
anchor leans against one wall. 
</P>
<P>
OK, there's a lot of artifice at Hymie's, but I found the room cozy and almost 
elegant. Drift away in the fantasy. You'll be back on land soon enough when the 
bill arrives. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hymie's is not cheap. The cost of seafood may have risen recently, but 
that doesn't explain some of these prices, which are as high as you'll find 
almost anywhere in the Valley. Broiled swordfish, for instance, is $19.95. 
Linguine with seafood is (gasp!) $23.95. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of the best things at this restaurant is free; namely, the 
Pioneer sourdough rolls that come steaming hot from the kitchen. And in 
fairness it should be pointed out that the lunch menu is quite reasonable, with 
many entrees less than $10. But if you plan to dine in the evening, be prepared 
to pay handsomely for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's not that much of a privilege. The food is fine, but nothing 
much beyond chain seafood restaurant cooking. The menu is dominated by a 
lengthy list of fresh fish, most of which are cooked simply on a metal grill. 
No mesquite here. There are only a few attempts at sophistication (paella, 
bouillabaisse), and the usual smattering of steaks and chops for the tag-alongs 
who don't eat seafood. Any questions tonight? Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, start with clams Casino, juicy baked clams topped with delicious herbed 
bread crumbs. You might also consider sharing an entree salad such as the 
broiled salmon salad, really a huge Caesar with big chunks of fish mixed in. 
It's $14.95, but in this case the price is justified. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to order an appetizer. All entrees come with a choice of 
soup (Boston or Manhattan style chowder) or a house salad. The red chowder is 
far better than the white, a flavorsome broth with large chunks of celery, 
potato and minced clam swimming in it. The white chowder is just plain starchy 
-- as, it must be admitted, 90% of all "New England" chowders west of Block 
Island tend to be; one of life's great mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
It's no mystery that most people come here for fish, though. Ready for your 
options? You won't need a pencil. You may have your fish grilled plain, grilled 
with garlic butter or grilled with a Dijon mustard sauce. Oh, a few sautes 
sneak in there on special request, and they deep-fry catfish and maybe one or 
two other things when no one is looking. 
</P>
<P>
But that is basically it. And if you like your fish at all undercooked, you'd 
better bring a large, clearly lettered sign and wave it in the chef's face. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered the swordfish in mustard sauce one night and didn't so much mind that 
it was overcooked. What bothered me was that I couldn't even see, much less 
taste, the Dijon sauce. Luckily, I had a thinking man's waiter that night. When 
I pointed out the problem, he brought me a sauce boat of surprisingly good 
mustard sauce with the texture of a well-executed Hollandaise, and in doing so 
turned a bland dish into an exciting one. 
</P>
<P>
A friend ordered grilled tuna steak and it turned out firm and sweet, with just 
the right amount of garlic and black pepper. If it had been cooked just a tiny 
bit less it might have been spectacular. A third person's soft-shell crab, 
though, was an unmitigated disaster. The crabs had lost all sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
Let me pass on a survival tip for Hymie's diners, learned from bitter 
experience: Even with these problems, stick to the simple dishes. Paella, for 
instance, should be fluffy and perfumed with saffron; the grains of rice should 
be discreet. At Hymie's it's awful and mushy, like a bad risotto. I couldn't 
taste any saffron, there was no additional flavoring such as sausage, the 
scallops had become soft and there were far too many peas. I shudder to think 
what Hymie's does to bouillabaisse. 
</P>
<P>
No complaints about desserts here, though (none made on the premises, anyway). 
The waiter kindly put me off the rum baba ("It tastes like a soggy doughnut") 
in favor of an excellent strawberry tart with a chocolate nut crust and a 
Bavarian cream filling. The kiwi fruit tart wasn't bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, just try getting one of those on Cape Cod.

OXNARD FACES HARD CHOICES IN TRIMMING $2.8 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last three years, Oxnard has been able to use reserve funds to fend off 
a government administrator's most dreaded foe: a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But the fiend has returned with a price tag of $2.8 million, and officials for 
the city -- operating on an annual budget of $61.7 million -- have vowed not to 
touch its reserves, which have dwindled to a dangerously low level. 
</P>
<P>
As the city begins to discuss ways to chop the deficit, many residents fear 
that, without the use of reserve funds, the hungry deficit will eat away at 
city services such as police and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, voters overwhelmingly rejected a 5% utility-tax increase 
that city officials had hoped would solve the city's financial crisis by 
generating $5 million annually. The loss at the polls came despite a $40,000 
publicity campaign for the measure, funded primarily by developers and city 
employee groups. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said service and personnel cuts are now inevitable. The 
City Council began meeting last week to discuss which cuts to make and how deep 
to make them. But council members decided to delay final decisions until 
Tuesday, when the results of a long-awaited management audit are to be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to balance the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, City 
Manager David Mora has compiled a list of 64 personnel cuts -- including 16 in 
the Police Department and eight in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
An early target for cuts, the Colonia Youth Boxing Gym was taken off Mora's 
cost-cutting list last month after several Latino parents urged the council to 
spare the gym, which costs the city about $44,000 a year and serves about 50 
boys a day. 
</P>
<P>
While some city officials have characterized the city's fiscal situation as a 
full-blown crisis, others are more optimistic. "This is not the end of the 
world, and we are acting like it is," Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said at the 
beginning of last week's budget hearings. 
</P>
<P>
This year's deficit is primarily the result of several unexpected expenditures, 
including a $690,000 increase in the cost for workers compensation and $460,000 
to remove asbestos from city buildings, Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have these new elements, we'd be balanced," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
Management and Budget Director Bill Mayer said Oxnard's long-term budget 
problems have developed because of a series of revenue losses beginning in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
For example, that year the federal government ended a revenue-sharing program 
that generated $2.2 million a year for Oxnard. The same year, the city lost an 
additional $1.5 million because of reduced franchise taxes paid by Southern 
California Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the city lost $2.1 million when the City Council eliminated a 2% 
utility tax two years before it was scheduled to expire. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, Oxnard began losing $600,000 annually when fines from 
convicted drunk drivers began to be diverted from the city to the county. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayer said the city is beginning to see increased sales-tax revenue 
generated from several new businesses, such as the Price Club, Home Depot and 
the Oxnard Auto Mall, all of which opened recently near the Pacific Coast and 
Ventura freeways. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city is expecting increased sales and property taxes from several 
new developments -- including the 450,000-square-foot Plaza del Norte shopping 
center, to be completed in September, and the 4.4-million-square-foot Town 
Center business park and shopping mall, to be completed within 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The developments "have the potential to ease the problems that we have," Mayer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, revenue from such new developments are not expected to solve this year's 
budget crisis, and city officials say Oxnard residents are just going to have 
to tighten their belts. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department would suffer the biggest financial loss -- $795,000 a 
year -- under Mora's plan. Mora has suggested that the city eliminate 16 
positions, including six motorcycle traffic officers, a youth-services officer 
and a victim-assistance specialist. Anticipating such cuts, the department has 
left vacant four positions on the city's drunk-driving task force. Mora has 
suggested that the unit be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The 154-officer department already has eight vacancies. If the recommended cuts 
are made, those jobs would remain unfilled and eight more would be eliminated 
through attrition, city officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Robert Owens told the council last week that the recommended cuts 
would hurt the department's ability to protect residents. "I don't want to give 
up anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens told the council that the victim-assistance specialist works as a trained 
counselor for victims of rape and child abuse. The youth-services officer acts 
as a liaison to the city's elementary and junior high schools, he said. He also 
warned that, when the city eliminated the motorcycle traffic team in 1978, the 
number of traffic deaths in Oxnard jumped. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, when the drunk-driving enforcement team was eliminated, the 
Police Department has arrested 495 fewer motorists than during the same period 
a year earlier, when 1,690 were taken in, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, dozens of police officers and firefighters tried to eliminate the 
need for personnel cuts by campaigning door-to-door in support of the 5% 
utility-tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to save money, Councilwoman Ann Johs suggested last week that the 
county be asked to take over the police and fire protection in Oxnard. The 
council is scheduled to discuss the proposal on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Parks and Recreation Department would suffer the largest personnel losses 
under Mora's plan. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager has recommended the elimination of 17 positions there, 
including two landscape workers, a park ranger and nine custodians. Mora 
suggested that the city contract with a private firm to take over the city's 
custodial services. 
</P>
<P>
Mora has also suggested that the city close several buildings operated by the 
department on Sundays and eliminate the Junior High Grad Night Program. The 
city now spends $19,400 to supervise and transport almost 1,000 graduating 
junior high school students each year to a local amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
The city can save $478,000 by implementing these cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The loudest outcry from residents was prompted by Mora's recommendation to 
close the Carnegie Art Museum, which would save the city $140,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Broyles, chairwoman of the Oxnard Cultural and Fine Arts Commission, 
called the proposed closure "totally unacceptable." She has urged the council 
to "please seek another alternative cutback." Once the museum is closed, 
Broyles said, it will be almost impossible to persuade other museums to loan 
art exhibits to the Carnegie in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Andrew Voth said closure could permanently ruin the city's 
reputation in the art world. Just the rumor that the Carnegie will close has 
lost the museum $20,000 in grants, he said. "It's devastating." 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-square-foot museum, which houses a permanent collection of 250 
paintings and sculptures, opened in 1981 and has a staff of one part-time and 
three full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
Mora has proposed that the city save $343,500 by eliminating two emergency 
rescue squads and eight firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency vehicles, each staffed by four full-time firefighters, carry 
emergency tools -- such as the "Jaws of Life" -- to the scene of a fire or 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department has 43 firefighters and seven vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Richard Smith told the council last week that there are 22 
firefighters on duty at all times. He warned that elimination of the two squads 
would reduce fire service by 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the department normally dispatches 12 firefighters to battle a 
routine single-family house fire, leaving 10 firefighters to monitor the rest 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit frightening, frankly," he said of the proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the city has a mutual-assistance agreement with fire 
departments from nearby cities. 
</P>
<P>
Mora has suggested that the city close its main library on Sundays to save 
$11,000 in overtime salaries, which would entail no personnel cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager has also recommended that the city eliminate its $398,000 
contribution to the Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau, which employs six 
full-time staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Varley, executive chairman of the bureau, said elimination of the 
city contribution would force closure of the bureau. He said the elimination 
would have a devastating effect on tax revenue generated by hotels and by other 
tourism-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Mora also suggested that the city save $200,000 by eliminating three employees 
from the city's street-sweeping unit. City officials said such a reduction 
would mean that the average residential street would be swept every three 
months, while streets in business districts would be swept twice a month.

SAVING THE ANIMALS MIGHT PUT WARDENS ON ENDANGERED LIST; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: OFFICIALS FEAR THAT PROPOSITION 117 COULD DRAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
FISH AND GAME BUDGET AND FORCE SCORES OF LAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More mountain lions may roam Ventura County backcountry as a result of the new 
Wildlife Protection Act passed last week, but there may be fewer game wardens 
to protect them and other wildlife, state officials fear. 
</P>
<P>
The act, passed as Proposition 117 on the June 5 ballot, specifically prohibits 
hunting mountain lions for sport and also requires that the state spend $30 
million a year for 30 years to acquire habitat for mountain lions and other 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
But the new law says some of that money must come from existing wildlife 
programs and could force reductions in the state Fish and Game budget, said 
Capt. Roger Reese, who heads the force of state game wardens that patrols all 
of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and two-thirds of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The department's budget for wardens to enforce state environmental regulations 
could be cut by 25%, causing the layoff of up to 95 wardens statewide, 
according to a state Department of Fish and Game internal memo. 
</P>
<P>
That could mean a cut of up to five people from what Reese calls a skeleton 
crew of 23 wardens now assigned to his region. 
</P>
<P>
"We already need more people here," Reese said. Losing wardens or money for 
programs in the area "could mean the difference in the continuation of a 
species," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reese said one species that could be most threatened by a cutback in wardens is 
the least Bell's vireo, a bird that lives along stream beds. He said wardens 
regularly patrol stream beds and other habitat areas, looking for people 
destroying habitats and routinely filing reports against them with the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Two cases involving alleged destruction of stream bed areas along the Santa 
Clara River are now pending with the district attorney's office, Reese said. 
Without routine patrols, he said that such cases would go undetected and the 
endangered least Bell's vireo could die out. 
</P>
<P>
To a lesser degree, Reese said, a reduction in the number of wardens would 
jeopardize the peregrine falcon that nests in cliff areas of the county and the 
least tern and the clapper rail that nest at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
But Allan Lind, staff consultant to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said 
program and staff cuts can be avoided if a plan now being hashed out by his 
committee is successful. 
</P>
<P>
"We can prevent that from happening by redirecting funds from Proposition 70," 
Lind said, referring to a 1988 initiative. "It will save us from making more 
cuts to Fish and Game." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which must be approved by both houses of the Legislature as well as 
Gov. George Deukmejian, faces opposition from Proposition 117 author Gerald 
Meral, executive director of the Planning and Conservation League, a wildlife 
preservation group based in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Meral contends that Proposition 117 money should not come from bond money 
already set aside for wildlife habitat. Instead, it should come from sources 
such as the environmental license plate fund, which helps pay for Fish and Game 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jerry Meral wants me to cut more biologists and wardens to protect the 
integrity of his Proposition 117, he's got another thing coming," Lind said. 
"It's narrow-minded and selfish and greedy, and the Legislature won't stand for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 117, which became effective immediately after it passed June 5, 
declared the mountain lion to be a specially protected animal, although the 
species is not considered endangered. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition also places a permanent prohibition on sport hunting of the big 
cats, replacing a temporary moratorium that had been in effect more than 10 
years, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
The new law requires the state to spend $30 million each year for 30 years to 
acquire and restore wildlife habitat. A third of the funds must be devoted 
specifically to mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
About $16 million of the money will come from the tobacco tax fund created by 
Proposition 99, money that is now earmarked for health programs, Lind said. 
</P>
<P>
The other $14 million per year will come from existing environmental programs 
and future state bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game officials, who already face a $12.5-million budget cut this year 
because revenues fall short of projected expenditures, fear that their programs 
will become a prime target regardless of the effects of Proposition 117. 
</P>
<P>
"Fiscal impact on the Department of Fish and Game could range up to $12 million 
in the first year," department Director Pete Bontadelli said in a press release 
Friday. The figure represents about 10% of the department's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
If an Assembly bill to provide $800 million for parks and wildlife sponsored by 
Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) is approved by the Legislature, and is passed 
by voters in November, the funding problem for Proposition 117 in future years 
could be solved, Lind said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 117 also changes the way mountain lions who kill livestock may be 
trapped and caught, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain lions in California now number about 5,000, and the animals range over 
about 80,000 square miles of backcountry, said Tom Paulek, assistant wildlife 
biologist at the Long Beach office of the Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
The backcountry of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in the Los Padres 
National Forest could support about 60 mountain lions, although no one knows 
the exact population of the secretive cats. 
</P>
<P>
A mountain lion tends to kill a deer about once every 10 days, hiding the 
carcass after eating its fill and returning to eat for the next few days, 
Paulek said. Other lions do not try to eat the kill of another cat, he said. 
But when a lion becomes too old or sick to catch a wild animal, or if the deer 
population is not sufficient to support the lion population in the area, the 
cat looks to easier prey in cattle yards or pig farms. 
</P>
<P>
"They have got to make a living," Reese said. When a cat is caught killing 
livestock, a so-called depredation kill, Fish and Game issues a permit to hunt 
and kill the offending lion, Reese said. Up until now, traps were set with 
snares near the carcass to help ensure the right lion was caught, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition 117 outlaws the practice of snaring and leg trapping, a ban 
Meral defends. 
</P>
<P>
"Snaring is efficient, all right," the author of Proposition 117 said. "But a 
snare doesn't know what it catches. Anything that strolls along and says 'Oh, 
here's a dead cow, I think I'll have lunch,' like a fox or a pet dog, could be 
left hanging in the air in the hot sun and die." 
</P>
<P>
Lions now must be hunted with dogs, which can be distracted with a fresher 
scent that could lead to the kill of an innocent animal, Reese said. That would 
leave the offending cat to kill again. 
</P>
<P>
So far in 1990, seven mountain lions have attacked and killed livestock in 
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, said Capt. Chris Patin, of the Long Beach 
Fish and Game office. The department has issued permits to trap and destroy 
those lions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wardens expect the numbers of livestock kills to increase during the summer 
months, and in future years as the number of mountain lions increases with the 
success of Proposition 117. 
</P>

ENVIRONMENTALISTS LOOK TOWARD CITY RACES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TWO UNEXPECTED VICTORIES HAVE GIVEN SLOW-GROWTH BACKERS HOPE THAT 
VOTERS ARE READY TO LIMIT DEVELOPMENT.

<P>
Unexpected victories by slow-growth advocates in three Ventura City Council 
races and in a county supervisor race have convinced environmentalists that the 
greening of politics has begun in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest that anybody running on a strictly environmental platform can 
get into office if they are credible," said Stan Greene, president of the 
700-member group Citizens to Preserve the Ojai. "There is a groundswell now. I 
think the last two elections bear that out." 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists are already looking to elections in November, when they 
expect numerous candidates to run for City Council seats in attempts to slow 
Oxnard's rapid growth and to curb what they see as development abuses in 
Camarillo and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with the astounding upset victory by 25-year-old political novice Maria 
VanderKolk for 2nd District supervisor on June 5, slow-growth advocates say 
they see unparalleled political possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our window of opportunity," said Ken Bauer of Westlake Village, a key 
strategist in VanderKolk's victory over Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk's success -- attributed to her opposition to two large housing 
projects and to Schaefer's refusal to seriously campaign -- also reflects the 
impact of canvassing by about 75 volunteers recruited primarily from the 
fledgling environmental group Save Open Space. 
</P>
<P>
That type of shoe-leather support by volunteers also marked the victories last 
fall of new Ventura City Council members Cathy Bean, Gary Tuttle and Todd 
Collart, who argued that city limits on growth were too lax. 
</P>
<P>
"VanderKolk's victory underscores the point that you can't get elected in this 
area without seriously addressing the issue of growth," said Kevin Sweeney, 
public-affairs director for Ventura-based Patagonia Inc., a clothing company 
that contributes to environmental groups and local campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a victory in the north part of the county and a victory in the 
south part," he said, "so now you begin to fill in the blanks in between." 
</P>
<P>
How that can be done is uncertain. But it appears that several slow-growth 
candidates will run in Oxnard this fall, when a majority of the five positions 
on the City Council will be on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Though filing does not begin until mid-July, Paul K. Dolan and Scott Bollinger 
have already announced their candidacies, citing "unequivocal opposition to 
future rampant growth" as part of their joint platform. 
</P>
<P>
Accountant Scott Weiss, who co-founded a slow-growth group early this year, 
said last week that the VanderKolk upset had encouraged him to consider running 
for the Oxnard council. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said his small organization is looking for other slow-growth candidates 
to back and is soliciting help from Patagonia, which provided financial backing 
and advice to VanderKolk and to the three Ventura candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In Camarillo, representatives from five homeowner groups are meeting to decide 
how to fight zoning changes that are allowing agricultural land to be developed 
as shopping centers and industrial parks, homeowner Chris DeSales said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
He expects an umbrella organization to be formed soon that will back City 
Council candidates in the fall campaign, said DeSales, a resident of Woodside 
Greens at the base of the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same issue with each group," he said. "People are seeing more 
agricultural land going under. We are all concerned about this kind of 
development, which seems to be continuing unabated." 
</P>
<P>
In Thousand Oaks, some supporters of VanderKolk say they hope to continue their 
crusade for stringent growth controls in City Council races there. Thousand 
Oaks, under Measure A passed in 1980, limits residential construction to 500 
units a year -- a sharp cut from the thousands per year proposed before its 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
But Eloise Zeanah, campaign manager for VanderKolk and twice an unsuccessful 
council candidate, said she and others are bothered by the City Council's 
borrowing of housing allocations from future years. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents need to know that our elected officials have skirted the intent 
of Measure A," she said. "It has not controlled growth, it has only metered it. 
These problems are beginning to surface now." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the environmentalists' surge of optimism since the recent victories, 
some slow-growth advocates have begun to discuss how they can push their 
message more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney, Bauer and others said that, if Ventura County environmental groups -- 
traditionally linked loosely and only marginally active in politics -- are to 
take advantage of voters' heightened concerns, a countywide environmental 
organization needs to be established. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to prevent Ventura County from becoming another Orange County, 
we really do need to get better organized," said Bauer, an ARCO executive who 
moved from Los Angeles in 1976 to escape crime and congestion. "I'd love to get 
something more permanent set up." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney said the current race-by-race approach to politics is not the best way 
to win elections. In addition, it provides little research to support the 
positions of slow-growth candidates once they are elected and "have to say no 
to development 400 to 500 times in four years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The next stage that has to happen will be a more proactive environmental 
organization," Sweeney said. Such an office, staffed with a full-time 
environmental researcher, would mean that "this county begins to develop a 
backbone around its environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A model for that organization can be found 30 miles up the U.S. 101 in Santa 
Barbara County, where a strong push since a disastrous 1969 oil spill has led 
to a network of environmental organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The groups include an agency to monitor neighborhood growth issues, a political 
action committee, a large research institute and a legal center with three 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocates, assisted by this network, now hold a majority of the 
seats on the Santa Barbara City Council and the County Board of Supervisors, 
said Robert Klausner, head of the political-action committee. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue is a slam dunk," Klausner said. "We haven't had to sell anything. 
It's tapping on concerns about the quality of life. It's not like someone is 
laying a philosophy on them." 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, individual environmental groups have scored a number of 
legal and political victories during the last 20 years, but no such network has 
ever been formed. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia recently has filled the role of a countywide environmental agency, 
contributing $35,000 to local organizations last fiscal year and offering 
political support in three campaigns, beginning with an unsuccessful 
congressional bid in 1988 by state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor-clothing company, whose influence has grown as its sales have 
boomed since 1984, contributed $15,000 in slow-growth advertisements to last 
fall's city races and $9,000 in ads leading up to this month's supervisorial 
election. Owners Yvon and Malinda Chouinard contributed $2,000 personally to 
VanderKolk, the maximum allowed by law. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of ways, we've been a deep pockets for this county," said Sweeney, 
who has orchestrated the company's move into political activism since he 
arrived two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia has also hired part time the pre-eminent environmental researcher in 
the county, Russ Baggerly, a former shoemaker from Meiners Oaks who for years 
was a spokesman for both Citizens to Preserve the Ojai and the Environmental 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Baggerly and his wife, Pat, are still directors of the Environmental Coalition, 
a loose-knit group that takes positions on countywide issues and claims about 
400 members. 
</P>
<P>
Several directors of the Environmental Coalition said in interviews that they 
too would like to see a more coherent countywide approach to environmental 
problems but see no obvious way to achieve that goal. 
</P>
<P>
"For 10 years now, I've been told that there are two things I have to do -- go 
out and get volunteers and get people elected to office. I'm absolutely 
worthless at both," said Cynthia Leake, a coalition director and chairwoman of 
the 1,800-member Sespe Group of the Los Padres Chapter of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
To create a political arm "takes money, time and energy. We need a staff and 
don't have one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Baggerly said that while local environmentalists want more support for 
both research and political campaigns, they haven't come to expect it. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably take it a race at a time," he said. "We know we have to get 
environmentally sensitive people elected to office. But it comes down to 
money." And neither staunch environmentalists nor residents who simply want to 
slow the pace of growth seem to contribute much to such campaigns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Moyer, president of the coalition and a new member of the Ventura Planning 
Commission, said there are other basic problems with the concept of a 
countywide environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
"Different groups have different objectives, and they don't always overlap," 
said Moyer, an air-quality expert who works for Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the east and west counties, separated by the Conejo Grade, are 
geographically distinct and have different problems, as do the inland areas 
near Ojai and Fillmore, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So things are still very much fragmented on both a geographical basis and on 
an issues basis," he said. "That's always going to be a problem with 
environmental groups. Though they all arguably are under this green umbrella, 
they have different interests and some of them are not very political at all." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle, a former world-class runner elected on a 
slow-growth platform last fall, said: "I think the environmental movement is 
here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not going to go out and try to organize the county. I'm staying in 
Ventura. I've got enough problems right here." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's desire to hold back the sprawl of Los Angeles County has been 
apparent for at least three decades, veterans of the environmental movement 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, formed in the mid-1960s, blocked an effort to 
widen California 33, which would have allowed a growth boom. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Pat Ellison, fresh from cleaning sea birds soiled with oil from the 
Santa Barbara slick, helped found the Environmental Coalition. And in 1973, she 
joined two other slow-growth candidates on the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
With John McWherter, who is still on the council, they approved a series of 
pioneering reforms that created an agricultural preserve within the city and 
forced the clustering of new construction closer to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County also approved a General Plan that requires development to be 
clustered in or near cities. Now, all 10 cities in the county, except for 
Oxnard, limit construction in some way. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of victories over the last 20 years, but we're still 
struggling hard," Ellison said.

SIX IS NOT ENOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
FATHERHOOD: KEVIN KOLBECK LOVES HAVING A BIG FAMILY. HE SAYS DISCIPLINE -- AND 
A SUPPORTIVE WIFE -- ARE ESSENTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With six children and another on the way, Kevin Kolbeck has a big family by 
today's standards. 
</P>
<P>
According to state figures, the average household in Ventura County has only 
3.006 people. 
</P>
<P>
But Kevin Kolbeck hasn't finished with fatherhood. By the time he and his wife, 
Michelle, are through, they may well raise that statistic by a thousandth or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not shooting for any particular number, but 12 is not out of the 
question," Kolbeck said. "I tell people we want to have a birthday each month 
of the year." 
</P>
<P>
On Father's Day, many dads savor the unique satisfaction of creating and 
nurturing a child. For Kevin Kolbeck, there is also the satisfaction of 
accomplishing his life's goal. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up, I just loved family life," Kolbeck said. "I couldn't 
wait to have my own and do the same things my parents and sisters and I did 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The Kolbecks, who live in Santa Paula, do just about everything together. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate not having the kids involved in what we're doing," Kolbeck said. "We 
rarely do things apart." 
</P>
<P>
That means taking two cars to the drive-in movies, as the family did the other 
night -- one for any little Kolbecks who fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
It means bringing the whole brood when Kevin competes in his men's basketball 
league, when Michelle Kolbeck goes shopping, when the family attends Sacred 
Heart Catholic Church in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Kevin said, it means discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's the key to success in a big family, having kids who behave," he 
said. "Then you're not afraid to take them places. You can sit and have an 
enjoyable meal as a family. Even with six kids you can still do that." 
</P>
<P>
At Carrow's Restaurant in Santa Paula one night last week, the Kolbeck kids -- 
two boys, four girls, ages 9, 7, 5, 4, 2 and 1 -- clustered around their 
parents while waiting for a table. 
</P>
<P>
"How many highchairs?" the hostess asked. 
</P>
<P>
One for baby Daniel was enough, but Michael, the oldest of the children, 
dutifully fetched booster seats for his two youngest sisters, Leah and Rebecca. 
The others are Sarah and Rachael. 
</P>
<P>
After placing orders -- mostly $1.99 entrees from the kids' menu -- the family 
talked about such things as what happened at school that day, their dog and two 
cats and the untimely demise of a pet rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
"You never have anything lacking to discuss when you have this many children," 
Michelle said. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad was something of a disciplinarian," Kevin said, explaining his own 
philosophy of fatherhood. "He wanted kids to be courteous to others and one 
another." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin and Michelle grew up in Iowa. He was the oldest and only boy among five 
children. Michelle was one of six. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin said he toyed with the idea of becoming a priest. "Then I saw my vocation 
was with the family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It made a difference in dating and courtship," he said. "I was looking for a 
certain type of spouse. Most of the women thought I was crazy. They'd say, 'you 
want to have how many kids?' " 
</P>
<P>
Michelle said that was more or less her reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"He came into this relationship knowing what he wanted," she said. "I thought 
it was very strange at first, because I was going to be this big career 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle does have a job as a merchandiser for General Foods. Two to four 
nights a week, she visits grocery stores to make sure that the company's 
products are properly displayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I move Jell-O around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what my career is. It's raising six children." 
</P>
<P>
Her seventh is due in October -- one of the remaining six months when none of 
the Kolbeck children have birthdays. (The other open months are January, March, 
April, June and November.) 
</P>
<P>
Michelle's flexible work schedule allows her to stay with the kids until Kevin 
arrives home from his teaching job at Thomas Aquinas College. 
</P>
<P>
"We hardly ever have baby-sitters," Michelle said. "Not for work, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Their two incomes amount to about $40,000 a year, Michelle said. That's enough 
to make the payments on their three-bedroom house and buy a few extras, such as 
the stereo in the living room and the glass of Scotch that Kevin enjoys after 
work. 
</P>
<P>
But, Michelle said, "we certainly don't send the kids to first grade in L.A. 
Gear shoes." 
</P>
<P>
She said Kevin is "a very unique husband." 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways he's a better parent than I am," she said. "At least he was smart 
enough when he was young to know what's important in life."

SOME VICTORY!

<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Charles Getz, who argued the state's case in the El Cajon 
malathion spraying trial, is reported to have said the court's decision was "a 
victory for the environment, period." ("El Cajon Gets Its Second Dose of 
Malathion," June 5.) 
</P>
<P>
Orwellian Doublespeak of the first order! 
</P>
<P>
I was struck by the similarity of his attitude to that of an American officer 
present at Ben Tre, Vietnam, in February, 1968, who is reported to have said, 
"It became necessary to destroy the town in order to save it." 
</P>
<P>
If the governor and his minions continue their chosen course, they will not 
only degrade our shared environment in known and unforeseen ways, they will 
also erode the public trust in our government, demonstrate the arrogance of 
unaccountable bureaucrats and seriously impact the public health. For what? The 
shelf life of an avocado in an export market?

COMMUNITY COLLEGE TEACHERS DESERVE A PAT ON THE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The persistent demand by some San Diego Community College district faculty 
members for a financially accountable school district paid off this week when 
the teachers reached a tentative settlement of their lawsuit over the 
district's unusual nonprofit foundation. The teachers deserve a collective pat 
on the back for their zealous protection of public money. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, the foundation will turn over control of its $8-million 
endowment to the district's trustees and pay more than $1 million more into the 
fund over the next two years. More importantly, the foundation's directors will 
resign as overseers of the endowment and relinquish their authority to the 
district's elected trustees, who have had no control over the foundation board 
for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
That should end a situation that had created considerable distrust between the 
teachers and the district's board over the highly questionable financial 
arrangement and its impact on faculty salaries, which historically have been 
among the lowest in the state. Ultimately, the dispute ended in court. 
</P>
<P>
Former Chancellor Garland Peed revived the dormant foundation in the early 
1980's to serve as a fund-raising arm of the community college district, which 
includes 100,000 students at Mesa, Miramar and City colleges. Each year, the 
foundation gives half of the endowment interest to the district. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the faculty, the foundation illegally took revenue belonging 
to the district and actually competed with the district when it bid on 
educational contracts. Even worse, the foundation's books were not open to 
faculty and its directors were not elected or accountable to students, faculty 
or the public. 
</P>
<P>
Then there were the unusual honorariums that the foundation paid to legislators 
for speaking engagements. In 1986, the foundation gave out $33,860 -- $10,000 
to State Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Chula Vista) alone. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Peed, who was heading both the district and the foundation, announced 
that he would give up his duties with the school system to lead the foundation. 
He later left to head a community college in Cupertino. 
</P>
<P>
The public -- and the community college district -- will be served best by an 
end to the unseemly arrangement with the foundation. Public agency money 
belongs under the control of elected trustees, who will be wise to spend it on 
student and teacher needs instead of political lobbying.

LOVE: A FATHER'S LIFELONG BUT THWARTED WISH TO LIVE IN SAN DIEGO IS REALIZED BY 
PROXY -- LONG AFTER HIS DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCHELL TENDLER, Mitchell Tendler is a free-lance writer who lives in San 
Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1928, my father made plans to move our family from Detroit to San Diego. Why 
it never happened was a great sadness that shaped the remaining half of his 
life, and ultimately helped plot mine. 
</P>
<P>
The thought occurs to me now, as I sit in my San Diego home, because on this 
Father's Day I am older than my father was when he died in 1960, at 64. 
</P>
<P>
Max was 32 in 1928, and, considering his beginnings, he was on top of the 
world. In 1913, he and two sisters arrived at Ellis Island with that wave of 
Eastern European immigrants who came to live in America, the land of milk and 
honey where the streets were paved with gold. 
</P>
<P>
They came to Philadelphia from Bessarabia, when that buffeted piece of 
geography belonged to Romania. An older brother, who set out for Buenos Aires, 
was never heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, Max met Bertha, who had come over with her parents and six 
sisters from Pikov, a tiny shtetl in the Ukraine. They married, my two older 
brothers were born, I was conceived, and the family moved to Detroit, where I 
was born, in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Max worked long hours in a small grocery store. But it was his store, so what 
did the hours matter? He was up at 4 in the morning three days a week to buy 
produce at the open market and worked six nights until eight. Sunday was a 
piece of cake. He closed the store at noon. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s the stock market soared, there were two chickens in every pot and 
a car in every garage. Max shared in the nation's prosperity. He owned a Buick, 
a hard, yellow straw hat with a round brim that was fashionable at the time, 
and he was able to save money in the bargain. Life was good! From Bessarabia to 
Philadelphia had been a good move. From Philadelphia to Detroit had been a good 
move. 
</P>
<P>
Then Max began to hear about a place out in California where there was sunshine 
every day. He had trouble with the name, San Diego, but not with the concept. 
He had been taking risks all his life. At 32, the thought of moving from snow 
and ice to everlasting sunshine wasn't a risk at all -- it was only good sense. 
</P>
<P>
He would open a store in San Diego and continue his success there. Easy. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so simple in Bertha's mind. She had been married at 17, and was 
already the mother of two boys at 19. Her girlhood had passed her by and now, 
at 28, with three sons (and a miscarriage in between) she yearned for 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
Max could not be blamed for his ambition. Bertha could not be blamed for 
wanting peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
When Max said he was giving money (his life savings, it turned out) to a 
relative who was going to buy real estate in San Diego, Bertha wasn't so sure. 
After all, they were doing so nicely in Detroit, why tempt fate? 
</P>
<P>
Max assured her that the first winter they were in San Diego, in the sunshine, 
she would bless him for having rescued her from the bitter cold of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
In quick succession, the relative who was to buy real estate went west and 
disappeared, the stock market crashed, the Great Depression began, and Max lost 
his store. Bertha's reminders that she warned him not to send the money were 
not gentle. 
</P>
<P>
My father went through five stores during the Depression. Each failed. At one 
point, he had what they called in those days a "nervous breakdown." He was 
reduced, finally, to taking a job in the store of a brother-in-law -- the 
ultimate indignity. 
</P>
<P>
We lived in a series of grubby flats. When I became old enough to understand 
such things, I learned that the rent was $10 a month, and we were never able to 
pay on time. 
</P>
<P>
I also remember one noon when I was 9 and was home for lunch from elementary 
school. My mother had a cup of coffee while I ate. A cockroach fell from the 
ceiling into her coffee. I will never forget the expressions of horror, 
disgust, then hot rage that crossed her face. It was my father's fault, of 
course. Who else to blame? 
</P>
<P>
The mythology is that adversity brings couples together. I have yet to meet a 
couple whose love deepened while they were having difficulty paying the rent or 
clothing their children. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Depression was swallowed up by the war. My father acquired another 
store and, thanks to the wartime economy, began making money again. The 
cockroach-infested flats were replaced by a single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
But fate was not yet finished with Max. The war ended and after the short, 
postwar boom, small stores began experiencing difficult times. The recessions 
of the Eisenhower years and the emergence of the supermarket presaged the end 
of the neighborhood grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
There seemed to be no solution to those problems. My father had his first heart 
attack in 1954, about the time that it was disclosed that an expressway would 
be built along Russell Street, where the store stood. 
</P>
<P>
The state would buy up the property, the merchants were told. That was the good 
news. The reality was that the state moved agonizingly slowly. Houses were 
abandoned; customers disappeared. Having been the cause of emptying the 
neighborhood, the state then would pay only a pittance for a business, which, 
after all, wasn't very productive. 
</P>
<P>
My mother got the pittance. My father was spared the final irony; he died while 
representatives of the state of Michigan were still "negotiating" the purchase 
of his shell of a store. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years after my father's death, I too grew weary of the Detroit winters and 
succumbed to the lure of San Diego. As I prepared to move my family from 
Detroit to San Diego in 1970, I was apprehensive about the impending change. 
Here I was, a college educated, experienced professional, with a good position 
in county government waiting for me when I arrived, and I was nervous. Then I 
thought of my father. 
</P>
<P>
My father never spent a day in a U.S. school, his signature was 50% scrawled 
bluff, and he couldn't wait to try his luck across the country in that city 
with the unpronounceable name. 
</P>
<P>
So, Happy Father's Day, pop. For what it's worth, you made it to the city of 
eternal sunshine, after all. I brought your proxy.

QUIT WHINING

<TEXT>
<P>
The privileged yuppies who were so cleverly prepared to argue against a 
landfill site in North County (with videos and computer-generated graphics) at 
the county Planning Commission meeting June 12, are just more NIMBY (Not In My 
Back Yard) whiners. There is no place in North County for a landfill? Give me a 
break! 
</P>
<P>
An environmental argument could be made against any place. But those of us who 
create trash do harm the environment. Those of us who drive cars or ride buses 
pollute the air. This is the lifestyle we inherited and will continue living. 
</P>
<P>
The North County residents tipped their hand when they argued for sending their 
trash to Riverside County or South San Diego County. For all their impassioned 
environmental arguments, they just don't want it around them.

POWAY CRASH LEAVES 1 DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's authorities said Saturday that they are investigating the possibility 
that alcohol or drug use may have been a factor in a head-on, two-car crash in 
Poway late Friday that left one person dead and four others injured. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities suspect that Richard Ray Laninovich, 27, of Poway, the driver of 
the car that caused the accident, was using drugs or alcohol, according to a 
sheriff's account released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Laninovich was dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The other four victims -- including three passengers in Laninovich's vehicle 
and the driver of the other car -- remain hospitalized Saturday with a variety 
of injuries. All are expected to recover. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 11:30 p.m. Friday as Laninovich was driving his sedan 
south on Old Coach Road in Poway, authorities said. About a half-mile north of 
Espola Road, deputies said, Laninovich's car crossed over the center line and 
crashed head-on into an oncoming vehicle driven by Barbara Malone, 54, of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, who suffered severe leg wounds, was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, 
where she was listed in stable condition Saturday. Also stable at Sharp was 
Albert Russell, 22, a Poway resident who was a passenger in Laninovich's car. 
Two of the dead man's other companions, Michael Reel, 18, and Nick Cornell, 20, 
were in stable condition at Palomar Medical Center.

HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST REVELS IN NEW FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Mart Niklus, an Estonian human rights activist, spent his days 
monotonously attaching electrical cords onto irons in a labor camp in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, Niklus, whose imprisonment was widely decried throughout the 
Western world, was sitting in the den of a Bell Canyon residence speaking 
whimsically about hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like very much to see the birds of America," he told his host, Jaak 
Treiman, the honorary counsel for Estonians in Los Angeles. "I have never seen 
a hummingbird before." 
</P>
<P>
Niklus had just spent an hour talking intensely about his experience in Soviet 
prisons and the plight of the Baltic states. At his feet lay dozens of 
articles, commendations, photographs and other documents about his ordeal and 
his people's struggle for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it says something about the resiliency of the human spirit that Niklus, 
who spent half his adult life in Soviet prisons, could still appreciate a 
bird's song. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonian ornithologist is in Los Angeles to accept the Freedom Award given 
by the Baltic American Freedom League. He will visit former President Ronald 
Reagan at his Century City office Monday to thank him for his diplomatic 
efforts to get human rights activists released. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles group honored Niklus two years ago, but he was forbidden by the 
Soviet government to leave the country. Instead, the group was linked to its 
honoree by an emotional telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Treiman presented a transcript of that telephone call and the 
2-year-old award before an audience of about 100 mostly elderly Estonians. The 
group had kept the framed award for fear it never would reach Niklus. 
</P>
<P>
"You asked us not to send it back because you were afraid the Soviets would 
confiscate it," Treiman told Niklus. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered at the Estonian House meeting hall in the West Adams District of Los 
Angeles, the Estonians munched radish and egg sandwiches and peppered the guest 
with questions. Niklus, who wore a lapel pin with the flags of Estonia and the 
United States on his sport coat, avoided talking about his years in prison. He 
seemed most animated when he spoke in Estonian and discussed his homeland's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to restore the legitimate government in Estonia," he said. "We 
hope the free world will support us and will understand us." 
</P>
<P>
No longer prohibited from traveling, Niklus, 55, has been visiting throughout 
the West since May. At each stop, he expresses his skepticism about reforming 
communism. It must instead be replaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly there have been great changes in the Soviet Union," Niklus said at 
Treiman's residence Saturday morning. But he added, "The system is nowhere 
close to being democratic." 
</P>
<P>
Niklus, who tends to pace as he talks, frowned when asked about Americans' 
enchantment with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the free world should get rid of Gorby-mania," Niklus said. "He 
doesn't deserve it. The free world lets itself be hoodwinked by the 
Communists." 
</P>
<P>
Niklus also is a politician. He was elected as a delegate to the Congress of 
Estonia and the Council of Estonia, a 70-member standing committee of the 
Congress. At one of the first sessions of Congress, Niklus arrived wearing his 
striped prison uniform, which he smuggled out of a labor camp. 
</P>
<P>
Niklus was first imprisoned in 1958 for smuggling censored photographs of 
Estonia to the West. He has been incarcerated three times since, often kept in 
tiny isolation cells. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, his cause had been championed by Amnesty International, the 
National Academy of Science, the International PEN clubs and others. In 1984, 
nearly 200 U.S. congressmen sent Niklus greetings on his 50th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was the outside help that prompted his early release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I should be somewhere in Siberia," Niklus said with a smile.

OFFICER KILLS MAN DURING RESPONSE TO ALLEGED FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police officer, responding to a reported domestic dispute at a home 
Saturday morning, shot and killed a man who was threatening to strike the 
lawman with a metal baseball bat, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
A police account, released in the afternoon, stated that officer Brad Phelps 
discharged a single shot from his 9-millimeter, semi-automatic service revolver 
as the bat-wielding man approached the lawman in a "threatening manner" and 
appeared poised to swing the bat. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Phelps fired when the man was less than 10 feet away, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 10:30 a.m., inside the victim's South San Diego 
home, in the 3800 block of Hemlock Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Phelps and two other lawmen had gone to the residence in response to a 
report of a man beating his pregnant wife, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as Luis Frank Perez, 28, was struck in the head, police 
said. He was dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Also present at the home was the victim's wife, Maria Perez, 17, who is about 
seven months pregnant, according to police and a nursing supervisor at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista. The woman, who had no visible injuries, was 
being held for observation at Scripps, the nursing official said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident comes after a recent rash of law enforcement shootings in the San 
Diego area that has provoked an outcry from various rights groups, including 
the American Civil Liberties Union, who have questioned whether officers have 
been using sound judgment before firing. Law enforcement guidelines generally 
permit lawmen to use lethal force only if their lives or the lives of others 
are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of area law enforcement authorities, including the San Diego 
police, have defended the actions of their officers and maintained that each 
incident is investigated thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
The official police account of Saturday's shooting, while making no judgment on 
whether the use of force was justified, stated that the officer responded to a 
clear threat -- a man wielding a "full-sized metal baseball bat." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Phelps was reassigned to an administrative post -- standard procedure 
in incidents involving shootings by city police officers -- pending resolution 
of the case, said police spokesman Sgt. Fred England. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say all police shootings are subject to an internal review as well 
as a criminal investigation by homicide detectives, who forward the results of 
their inquiries to the district attorney. The district attorney is then 
responsible for determining if lethal force was justified. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police provided the following chronology of Saturday's shooting: 
</P>
<P>
Three uniformed officers -- Phelps, Norman Ernsbarger and Robert Martin -- 
arrived at the residence about 10:30 a.m. and could hear the sounds of a 
"violent argument" coming from inside the small house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
An "uncooperative" male occupant responded when police knocked at the door, 
according to the official account. The officers say they heard a woman 
screaming inside the dwelling, prompting them to enter. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, according to police, the man retreated to the kitchen area, 
where he picked up the bat, which he held with one hand behind him. He refused 
to drop the bat despite "numerous" commands to do so, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Each officer then drew his service revolver, police said. Officer Phelps fired 
the fatal shot when the man approached, wielding the bat, according to police.

200 MARCH IN WILMINGTON TO DENOUNCE GANGS, DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 200 people chanting "Follow me! We're gang and drug free!" marched 
through Wilmington Saturday in what supporters hailed as their largest showing 
yet in support of grass-roots efforts to combat drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the marchers were children toting yellow balloons that lent a 
festive appearance to the rally. But the jovial atmosphere belied how serious 
they and their parents were about their mission. 
</P>
<P>
Angie Torres, a fifth-grader at Wilmington Park Elementary school, said one of 
her cousins -- a gang member -- died of a drug overdose two years ago. "I saw 
what happened," she said, "and I don't want that to happen anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The march was organized by the Community Reclamation Project, a federally 
funded pilot program launched in February, 1989, to encourage cooperation among 
neighborhood agencies that focus on gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the group has organized six other rallies -- in Carson, Lomita, Harbor 
City and Wilmington -- since October, Saturday's march in Wilmington was the 
first time that organizers brought an entire community together to make a 
stand, said Natalie Salazar, the project's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
A few Wilmington neighborhoods have been so besieged by gangs and violence that 
some residents have been unable even to get newspapers to make deliveries to 
their homes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to turn the tide, groups of schoolchildren for the past several 
months have been walking through their neighborhoods asking local businesses to 
help distribute pamphlets about the dangers of gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of businesses in hard-hit areas, it was a first step" toward 
eradicating the problem, Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's rally was smaller than organizers had expected, but they said any 
showing at all was a victory for the area because "a lot of people are scared 
to do anything that has to do with gangs," Salazar said. "They think that by 
coming out, that's going to mark them for retaliation. But we have to lower 
that fear factor, and the only way we can do it is to get more people out." 
</P>
<P>
To symbolize a sense of unity, two groups of demonstrators -- most wearing 
gang-neutral yellow T-shirts and toting signs and balloons saying "Rise up 
against gangs and drugs!" -- started marching at opposite sides of the 
community. They met about 1 1/2 hours later at Wilmington Town Square on Avalon 
Boulevard and I Street for an hourlong rally that included speeches by 
residents and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Among the marchers was Salvador Almanza, 9, who said he frequently sees gang 
members near his home "go into people's houses, stay about 20 minutes and then 
get in their car to leave." 
</P>
<P>
When asked what he thought they were doing, he replied: "Probably doing drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Dee Wiggington, 40, who organized a local chapter of Mothers Against Gangs two 
months ago, said many parents deny that their children are involved in gangs, 
even after the children show obvious signs of involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"If the parents in the community started taking control and responsibility for 
their own kids, you wouldn't have this problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Reclamation Project opened shop with a $1-million federal grant 
and was slated to last 18 months. A $70,000 grant from the Los Angeles County 
Probation Department two weeks ago allowed the group to continue its efforts 
through the end of September, Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the pilot project has focused on Lomita, Harbor City, Wilmington and 
Carson, project officials are hoping their work with local agencies will serve 
as a model for gang-infested communities nationwide, Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Chadwick, president of the Wilmington Chamber of Commerce, which helped 
sponsor Saturday's event, said community marches may not have an impact on 
hard-core gang members. But he added, "If just one person changes his mind, if 
just one person decides not to join a gang or not to use drugs, you're doing 
something worthwhile."

4 SOUGHT FOR JEWELRY ROBBERY IN TORRANCE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE DEPARTMENT STORE HEIST MAY BE RELATED TO A STRING OF SIMILAR 'SMASH 
AND DASH' HOLDUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance police are looking for four gunmen who raided a busy department store, 
smashed display cases and made off with about $100,000 in gold, diamond and 
gemstone jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ron Traber said detectives are checking the possibility that the robbery 
is related to a string of similar "smash and grab" holdups at jewelry stores 
throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Traber said the robbers entered the Service Merchandise store on Sepulveda 
Boulevard shortly after 8 p.m. Wednesday, ordered about a dozen customers to 
lie down on the floor and shoved a gun in the face of store clerk Marcus 
Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
"He was ordered to open the jewelry case and not to press any buttons," Traber 
said. "He complied with that order, but apparently it wasn't fast enough for 
one of the other suspects, because he jumped over the counter, took out a 
hammer and started hammering on the glass of another case." 
</P>
<P>
As three of the robbers scooped jewelry into a bank bag, a fourth ordered a 
store cashier to hand him money from her register. The woman turned over about 
$500, Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
After the robbery, the group fled south from the store on Ocean Avenue in a 
brown Chevrolet Corsica. About five minutes later, Traber said, a resident of 
the 22700 block of Marjorie Street called police to report seeing four 
suspicious men leaving one car and getting into another near her house. 
</P>
<P>
Police impounded the Corsica, which they believe was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
All four participants in Wednesday's robbery were black males, witnesses said. 
Three of them appeared to be in their mid-20s, and the fourth was described as 
a boy about 13 years old, 5 feet tall and weighing 120 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said one of the men had a medium build and was about 6-foot-5. A 
second man was described as 5-foot-9 and 170 pounds. The third man was 
reportedly a little younger than the first two, 5-foot-4 and 130 pounds.

TRANSIT OFFICIALS TO URGE 1-MILE REVERSIBLE LANE FOR SEPULVEDA BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles transportation officials said Saturday they will propose a 
reversible lane for a mile-long stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard to alleviate 
traffic problems for commuters during the drive home to the San Fernando Valley 
from jobs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
S. Edwin Rowe, general manager of the city Department of Transportation, told 
about 50 people attending the second Valley Transportation Summit at the Valley 
Hilton that he will present the plan to the City Council for approval as soon 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The summits, organized by Nikolas Patsaouras, a Southern California Rapid 
Transit District board member who lives in Tarzana, are aimed at finding 
short-term relief for the Valley's traffic woes. Participants include leaders 
of business, homeowner and civic groups, elected city and state representatives 
and transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting in April, participants asked city officials to revive 
proposals for reversible lanes on Victory, Ventura, Van Nuys and Sepulveda 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Under the department's proposal for Sepulveda Boulevard, Rowe said a reversible 
lane would be added for northbound vehicles between Mountain Gate Road and a 
point north of the Sepulveda tunnel in peak evening traffic hours, probably 
between 4 and 7 p.m. The extra lane would not be open to inbound motorists 
during the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the project would be about $100,000, Rowe said. It would be 
financed through Los Angeles County mass-transit funds or $1 billion the state 
will make available to local governments as a result of voters' passage of 
Proposition 111 on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe's proposal is an alternative to a similar plan proposed by Councilman 
Marvin Braude last month, but deemed ineligible for the county funds by a 
county Transportation Commission analyst, Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe promised to research reversible lanes for other portions of Sepulveda and 
Victory boulevards in the Van Nuys area by the group's next meeting. Rowe also 
will evaluate the feasibility of converting Victory Boulevard to a one-way 
street from the San Diego Freeway to Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
At the first summit, the group also proposed that electric buses, powered by 
overhead wires, replace diesel-powered RTD buses on Ventura Boulevard. RTD 
General Manager Gary Spivack said Saturday that it would cost about $15 million 
to electrify buses on Ventura Boulevard between Warner Center and Universal 
City.

Harold Katinszky seethes with anger whenever he sees empty seats on a 
commercial airplane. 
</P>
<P>
To the Lawndale private pilot and flight instructor, each empty seat represents 
a lost opportunity to help financially strapped cancer patients who can't 
afford expensive plane fares for trips to far-away hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of giving free flights to people in medical and financial need has 
fallen on deaf ears at most airlines. In 1984, however, a group of private 
pilots who already were flying supplies and organs in medical emergencies 
opened their doors to patients. 
</P>
<P>
About 850 "missions of mercy" are organized nationwide every year by 
AirLifeLine, a nonprofit charitable organization based in Sacramento with a 
network of 345 private pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Katinszky, 31, who flies out of the Hawthorne Airport, joined the AirLifeLine 
network in 1987. But earlier this year the pilot decided he had to give it up. 
Each flight, although tax deductible, was costing him about $400 in fuel, 
maintenance fees and time he could have spent teaching flying. Until he paid 
off some of his bills, Katinszky thought, he couldn't afford to be so 
magnanimous. 
</P>
<P>
Then in April he received a call from AirLifeLine. A 10-year-old girl with a 
rare and deadly form of leukemia needed transportation from Palo Alto to UCLA 
Medical Center, where she was to undergo a bone marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
He accepted the mission thinking, "This is so dumb, Harold. You can't afford 
this." 
</P>
<P>
But as soon as he met Ava Rocha, a slender child with light brown hair and a 
wide smile, his money problems seemed trivial. "I thought, I would have spent 
my last dime to help this little girl," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ava spent nearly two months at UCLA undergoing radiation treatment for her 
blood disorder before being transferred earlier this month to Children's 
Hospital at Stanford. A week ago, when doctors were sure that her immune system 
would not reject the bone marrow transplant she had received, they released her 
from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Although she lives in Modesto, she and her mother will remain in Palo Alto for 
the next two months so doctors at the Stanford hospital can monitor her 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It meant a lot to me that he would donate his time, his gas, his plane, 
everything," Ava's mother, Phyllis Rocha, said. "I really don't know how we 
would have gotten there without him." 
</P>
<P>
As for Katinszky, he vowed to continue flying for AirLifeLine, no matter the 
personal expense, and to do all he can to urge other pilots and commercial 
airlines to participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people out there that need my help, and it's the least I can do," he 
said. "If someone owns an airplane, he owes it to himself to help these people. 
We're not the heroes. The heroes are the children putting up a fight for their 
lives." Kim Kowsky

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: YACHT CLUB'S FIRST FEMALE MEMBER SAYS IT WAS JUST A 
MATTER OF TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Greg Krikorian 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sure, it's exciting and a privilege and all that to become the first woman 
member of the Catalina Island Yacht Club since its founding in 1924. But Cheryl 
Muat is still surprised that it's drawn any notice. 
</P>
<P>
How surprised? 
</P>
<P>
"When you called, I thought you were calling about a subscription," Muat told a 
reporter recently. "I mean, it's an honor to be the first woman member. But I 
didn't do this for any fanfare, and I'm still sort of stunned at the 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Stunned because the cheery mother of two joined the 200-member club to make 
friends, not waves. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like my husband and I said, 'Let's see if we can stir up a 
commotion,' " said Muat, 37, of Huntington Beach. "We just put in my 
application, waited and found out that I was accepted." 
</P>
<P>
Muat's path to the club was paved just over three years ago when its members 
amended the group's bylaws to permit women. The move was prompted by the hubbub 
facing another Santa Catalina boaters group, the Tuna Club, whose all-male 
membership came under scrutiny as it sought a new 10-year lease on an Avalon 
city building. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, there weren't any women clamoring to get into our club," recalled 
Ray Miller, publicity chairman for the yacht club. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Tuna Club's all-male membership became an issue, Miller said, "the 
board saw what was happening and said, 'Oh oh, we better do something to 
forestall any problems.' They decided the time had come to end discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
When that happened, Muat's parents urged their daughter to apply for 
membership. "My dad's a member and my mom's in the auxiliary. So when the 
bylaws were changed . . . I decided to apply," Muat said. 
</P>
<P>
With its membership strictly limited at 200, Muat had to wait several years, as 
does any new member, for a vacancy. And when it arrived last month, the San 
Pedro-born daughter and granddaughter of fishermen was at last a member of the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
"Being the first female member is an honor. The island means so much to me and 
my family," said Muat, whose children, Chris, 15, and Shauna, 12, have spent 
most of their summers on Catalina. Her husband, Drake, is a captain with the 
Newport Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I like being in the club just to be there. I like boating. The club is a nice 
place to go. The people are good people, fun people," she said. "And my husband 
and I felt this was a way for us to sort of have a piece of the island and the 
club." The family's 40-foot sportfishing boat is moored in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As for breaking new ground, Muat said, opening the doors to women, be it a 
yacht club or a fire department or almost anything else, just makes common 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason not to allow women or men or any group into an area if 
they're qualified," said Muat. 
</P>
<P>
"When fire departments first allowed women, it was a shock to a lot of people. 
Now, my husband works with women. He accepts them. He respects them," said 
Muat, who works for the Ocean View School District. "So long as someone's 
qualified, they should be accepted." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy, Muat said, has guided her for some time. Ten years ago, she 
remembers, the director of her son's Little League was shocked when she walked 
into his office and told him she wanted to coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy said, 'Oh, you want to be the team mother.' And I said, 'No, I want to 
coach.' The guy was just floored," says Muat, whose record was 15-3 that year 
as a Little League coach. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as she becomes a member of the yacht club, her husband is about to become 
the first male member of the women's auxiliary, whose bylaws also were changed 
several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And how does he feel about it? "Are you kidding? He's in seventh heaven about 
joining a club of all women," Muat said, laughing. "He's a fireman." Greg 
Krikorian

A MOTTO FOR COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's motto: As long as I have mine, to hell with everyone else! 
</P>
<P>
I guess it should come as no surprise that, once again, Orange County, the 
bastion of conservatism, greed and self-indulgence, goes against the homeless 
bond (Proposition 107) and two education bonds -- school districts (Proposition 
121) and higher education (Proposition 123) -- while the rest of the state 
voters approved them.

MEASURE M: OVERSIZED, OVERSOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Stan Oftelie's Commentary (June 10) bewailing the defeat of Measure M 
last November, I take strong issue with the statement that the package in 
Measure M represented a "strong technical program." 
</P>
<P>
I attended a meeting at my homeowners association where one of the "experts" 
who drafted the program attempted to explain and justify it. 
</P>
<P>
My understanding of the program from the explanation and further reading was 
that it was not drafted to solve Orange County's vexing traffic woes but to 
offend as few of the city councils as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the plan was too grandiose. It attempted to define a 30-year program 
for highways and public transportation but made no attempt to account for the 
price structure or availability of gasoline 30 years from today. Considering 
that the U.S. imports about 50% of its oil supply today and that U.S. 
production is declining, any long-range program that fails to finance public 
transportation adequately (Measure M devoted only one-third of its revenues 
toward public transportation) should not be considered favorably. 
</P>
<P>
I voted against Measure M not because it would raise taxes but because it was 
overblown, oversold and poorly conceived. A program that offered more 
reasonable specifics for a shorter period of time would get my vote and, if 
properly explained, just might get the vote of the majority of Orange 
Countians, even it if raised taxes.

MOVE EL TORO, TUSTIN MARINE STATIONS TO GEORGE AIR FORCE BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether we really need an international airport in Orange County, a better idea 
for the use of George Air Force Base would be to relocate both Tustin and El 
Toro to that location. 
</P>
<P>
For the same reasons that the other proposed sites are not suitable, it makes 
no sense for these military air bases to be located in urban Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Ask yourself if anyone in his right mind would consider establishing these air 
bases in their present locations at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in view of the impending cutbacks of military operations, the desire of 
the residents near George to continue its operation, the more appropriate 
environmental and safety conditions there, and the minuscule economic impact on 
us here of eliminating El Toro and Tustin, let's do it. 
</P>
<P>
As for high-speed trains, why not use them to connect John Wayne and Los 
Angeles International Airport and downtown Los Angeles, where we'd get 
coordinated benefits other than a faster means to deposit money with the 
ganglords in Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
As for what to do with El Toro and Tustin, how about national parks and/or a 
bird refuge and/or the agricultural operations they replaced originally that 
could absorb some of the greenhouse gases created in overdeveloped Orange 
County?

AN UNSAVORY TREND STARTING TO DEVELOP; 
</P>
<P>
PLANNING COMMISSIONERS SHOULDN'T FRATERNIZE, PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's nearly two weeks since the June 5 election, but one aspect of the campaign 
lingers like a hangover. It's the question of whether two members of the Orange 
County Planning Commission -- Stephen A. Nordeck and Roger D. Slates -- 
violated conflict of interest laws by hosting a dinner at which they reportedly 
solicited contributions for a Republican Assembly candidate. The matter is 
under investigation by Dist. Atty. Mike Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how that investigation turns out, the incident highlights a 
broader issue: Should commissioners be fraternizing with or accepting gifts 
from developers under any circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
Legal or not, these gifts and social meetings give the appearance that 
developers have a special relationship with commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of laws precluding the acceptance of anything from a developer, 
commissioners at least ought to do a better job of self-regulation. They should 
keep socializing with developers to a minimum and refuse all gifts. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits appointed board members from soliciting campaign funds of 
more than $250 from individuals who have matters before them. This is the law 
under which the actions of Nordeck and Slates are being questioned. In 
addition, appointed board members must disclose gifts worth more than $50 from 
firms or individuals who have business before them. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure statements filed with the county registrar of voters indicate that 
during the last year developers regularly treated current commissioners to golf 
games, baseball and theater tickets, lunches, dinners and other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Two commissioners reported accepting only one gift each: Thomas W. Moody (a $50 
gift certificate for a ham) and Slates (a membership to a country club valued 
at $350). 
</P>
<P>
But commissioners Nordeck, C. Douglas Leavenworth and A. Earl Wooden reported 
numerous meals and/or golf games with some of the biggest-name developers in 
the county. By the way, anyone familiar with the high cost of playing golf 
these days is likely to wonder about some of the bargain prices commissioners 
have reported for a membership and greens fees. 
</P>
<P>
But a larger point is that during the same period, no meals, golf or other 
gifts were reported from homeowner or environmental groups that might argue a 
different point of view before the commission. While these groups were free to 
give them, this is a practice done mostly by firms that can better afford to 
curry the favor of commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
As a body, the five-member commission weighs the merits of development projects 
in unincorporated areas and makes decisions as well as recommendations to the 
Board of Supervisors, whose members make appointments to the commission. 
Increasingly, development projects are hotly debated because of traffic 
congestion, air pollution and other environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
While few would suggest that development come to a halt, each new project must 
be considered against a backdrop of growth management. This takes more than 
simply balancing special interests against one another. It takes objectivity 
that is fostered by hearing all parties out equally. 
</P>
<P>
By accepting meals or golf games from developers, not to mention providing them 
with hours of undivided attention around the green, in the golf cart, or over 
the table, commissioners provide special access that goes beyond the normal 
channels available to others who also have a stake in the process. 
</P>
<P>
It smacks of cronyism.

VOTER SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, Orange County voters did it again. I do not understand how they do it, 
but they never fail to amaze me at every election. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was Propositions 108 and 111. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody who was paying attention to these propositions knew that 108 could not 
take effect unless 111 also passed. Nevertheless, 108 was passed in Orange 
County, and 111 was defeated. Thank goodness that the rest of the state had 
more brains. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, Orange County! Read the election material. Inform yourself before 
going to the polls. It is our responsibility to vote intelligently. An 
uninformed vote does more harm than good.

THE PLOTS THICKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was shocked to learn that the "Buena Park Community" is the only one of its 
kind in Orange County (June 5). 
</P>
<P>
Since February, my daughter and I have weeded, dug, planted and harvested two 
plots in the "Community Organic Garden" at Golden West College in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The peas, broccoli, red and green cabbage, strawberries, lettuce, cucumbers, 
zucchini, onions, carrots, etc., are now so abundant that we are able to not 
only enjoy a very healthy and tasty diet ourselves but also share our harvests 
with our neighbors and friends. 
</P>
<P>
More experienced gardeners have been wonderful about sharing their "tips" on 
composting, mulching, gopher control, etc. In addition to our individual plots, 
we have community areas with fruit trees, herbs, flowers and berries. 
</P>
<P>
I am extremely grateful to Golden West College for providing the opportunity to 
the community to participate in this ecologically sound as well as healthy 
activity.

A LIFE NO LESS PRECIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was recently requesting sponsorship, in the form of pledges, for the AIDS 
Walk Orange County, held June 10, at Mason Park in Irvine. I am writing in 
response to the reactions I received from many people. People from all walks of 
life (white- and blue-collar, wealthy and poor) who recoiled in horror as if by 
my very presence and mention of the word, the killer is at their door. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS is indeed a killer and, yes, AIDS is a gay disease. Gays did not cause 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The occurrence of this tragic disease is a biological event, not a moral 
comment. If that were so, how would one explain/justify the dichotomy of AIDS 
appearing in predominantly heterosexual populations in impoverished 
agricultural communities in Africa? It is also inaccurate to assume the 
promiscuity of gays or that all gays have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS has no respect for these imaginary boundaries that seem to make certain 
groups in society feel safe. It has touched most every group with any potential 
for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS has touched all racial and ethnic groups, gays/lesbians and heterosexuals, 
and all age groups from the mature (Paul Gann) to the adolescent (Ryan White) 
to the newborn babies. 
</P>
<P>
This to me is reason enough to support the cause to fund the research and to 
fight this catastrophic killer of gays and heterosexuals alike 
</P>
<P>
I, too, have a fear of AIDS. I am a female Caucasian, heterosexual, non-drug 
user. I also believe strongly that one's beliefs/lifestyle should not be forced 
on others, whether it be religion, politics or sexual preference. We are 
fortunate to live in a country that allows this freedom. Our preferences or 
choices are ours to make. 
</P>
<P>
I think we need to look at and inside ourselves, both individually and as a 
society. Is it so easy to turn our heads, hearts and pocketbooks on a group of 
people because they make different choices or have different lifestyles from 
our own or that which we consider normal? 
</P>
<P>
Finding a cure for the disease so the next "Ryan White" (and it seems there 
will be more), the next gay/lesbian, the next heterosexual or the next baby 
doesn't die is the real point. Life is precious -- no matter whose it is!

It seems inconceivable to me that three former presidents and other dignitaries

I hope his library will contain not only the record of his Administration but 
the complete story of Watergate and the stories of his vilified campaigns 
against Reps. Jerry Voorhees and Helen Gahagan Douglas. The missing 18-minute

CONSERVING WATER -- THE CONTRADICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I find it ludicrous that the city of Anaheim has sent out a glossy little 
brochure telling the citizens how they might save a few teaspoons of water. 
</P>
<P>
And today I read that the new public utilities general manager is "big" on 
conservation. Edward K. Aghjayan wants Anaheim to be a role model for water 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
How can the city reconcile this noble goal with continued annexation of more 
land to the east and the unrestricted housing developments in every part of our 
city, thereby increasing water usage? It doesn't make sense. Am I missing 
something here?

SOME GLAD TO SEE AGRAN GO; SOME HOPE HE'LL GO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As perestroika blossoms all over the world from Berlin to Romania to South 
Africa, it is accompanied by a dismaying response from frightened 
right-wingers, as evidenced by a resurgence of anti-Semitism, gay-bashing, 
white supremacy and neo-Nazism. This is true even on our own college campuses, 
now full of kids born after the Civil Rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's conservatives, like old Politburo members incapable of accepting 
change, were threatened by a leader who saw the future and moved proactively to 
shape it, instead of merely reacting on a crisis-by-crisis basis. As few other 
politicians have, Larry Agran recognized that environmental and economic 
problems cannot be solved in municipal isolation, and the solutions he set in 
motion are both innovative and exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
His problem is that he's always been about five years ahead of his time, with a 
vision 10 times as broad as the comfort zone of the basic pothole-patcher. He 
may have outgrown Irvine, but there's a wider world that desperately needs his 
courage and convictions.

<TEXT>
<P>
The June 5 electoral outcome in Irvine was a bitter disappointment to those of 
us who believe in the innovative but realistic kind of government that Larry 
Agran brought to this city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Agran demonstrated that government, the business community and 
grass-roots citizens can work effectively together to create a dynamic, 
productive and compassionate community. 
</P>
<P>
His leadership empowered us to envision Irvine as it might be and to join with 
our neighbors in working for a quality of life determined by citizen power 
rather than by corporate convenience. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the electoral outcome, however, the progressive community that 
has supported Larry Agran is still alive and thriving in Irvine. I believe that 
Irvine citizens do care about transportation, the environment, human rights, 
affordable housing, family reunification, open space and world peace. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Agran's foresight, integrity, optimism and compassion at City Hall will 
be missed, but the vision that he shared is far from dead.

On June 5, the voters of Irvine showed tremendous ignorance and lack of vision. 
By removing Larry Agran from Irvine's mayoral office, the Irvine voters voted 
to rid their city of the reputation of being one of the most progressive, 
innovative, problem-solving communities in America. 
</P>
<P>
On both sides of the political fence, I hear complaints about air pollution, 
crowded freeways, child day-care availability, and stagnant, conventional 
incumbent leadership. Larry Agran made innovative breakthroughs in all of these 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
To fault Agran for using the mayor's office to frame solutions to long-term 
environmental catastrophes such as ozone depletion is to show a fundamental 
ignorance of the seriousness and consequences for Orange County of many of our 
long-term environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
When the voters of Irvine ousted Mayor Agran, they also voted to leave many of 
our community's most serious problems neglected as they have been in the past 
by more "conventional" leadership.

COUNTY PLANS 2 BIG PROJECTS TO REUSE WASTE WATER; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: THE DROUGHT-FIGHTING, $185-MILLION PROJECTS WOULD RECLAIM SEWAGE 
WATER -- SOME FROM THE LOS COYOTES PLANT IN CERRITOS -- FOR PARKS, INDUSTRY AND 
OTHER USES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a bid to conserve water supplies in much of Los Angeles County, officials 
are planning to divert billions of gallons of treated waste water to parks, 
golf courses, freeway greenbelts, cemeteries, oil refineries and factories for 
landscape irrigation and industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
By substituting reclaimed waste water for drinking-quality water in sprinkler 
systems and industrial operations, water officials from El Segundo to Downey 
hope to stretch supplies of local ground water and imported water. The flow of 
imported water from the Colorado River and the eastern Sierra Nevada has been 
cut in recent years by a combination of drought and legal rulings. 
</P>
<P>
"It is basic conservation," said Richard W. Atwater, general manager of the 
West Basin and Central Basin municipal water districts, which supply water to 
2.5 million residents in the South Bay, Westside and Southeast Los Angeles 
County. "You are getting two uses out of every gallon of water." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater said two proposed water reclamation projects -- costing a total of $185 
million -- are scheduled to be built by the water districts over the next four 
years. The projects are expected to be funded by a myriad of local, state and 
federal sources, including rebates offered by the giant Metropolitan Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
In the larger of the two proposed projects, officials from the West Basin 
district are developing a $175-million plan for the South Bay to reclaim 22.8 
billion gallons of waste water a year from the city of Los Angeles' Hyperion 
sewage treatment plant in Playa del Rey. Water district and Los Angeles 
officials say it would be the largest waste-water reclamation project in 
California, conserving enough water annually to supply a city the size of 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The treated sewage water, which is now dumped into Santa Monica Bay, would be 
piped from Hyperion to a more intensive treatment plant, probably in El 
Segundo, and then distributed through underground pipelines to a variety of 
users in the South Bay. The network is expected to serve the Chevron and Mobil 
refineries and may be extended to Culver City and Los Angeles International 
Airport, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
By reusing water from the Hyperion plant, Los Angeles city officials said they 
would address another pressing environmental concern: the dumping of waste 
water into Santa Monica Bay. The West Basin proposal would reduce the plant's 
outflow into the bay by about 20%, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a win-win situation all around," said Bahman Sheikh, director of the 
city's newly created office of water reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
The second proposed project, sponsored by the Central Basin district, involves 
building a 26-mile network of pipelines that would transport waste water from 
the Los Coyotes reclamation plant in Cerritos to at least seven cities along 
the path of the Century Freeway. The $10-million project initially would 
reclaim about 1.9 billion gallons of water annually, but could double in size 
as more users become interested, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Coyotes plant, operated by the county Sanitation Districts, already 
supplies reclaimed water to Cerritos, Bellflower and Lakewood for irrigation of 
parks, schools and median strips. The new network would provide water to 
Downey, South Gate, Lynwood, Paramount, Compton, Norwalk and Bellflower, as 
well as to Caltrans for irrigation along freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach would not be part of the network because it receives reclaimed water 
from a treatment plant on Willow Street, also operated by the Sanitation 
Districts. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the West Basin and Central Basin water districts hope to connect 
the Hyperion and Los Coyotes networks so that cities across southern Los 
Angeles County would be assured a regular supply of reclaimed water, even if 
the flow from one reclamation plant were cut off because of repairs or an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the Century Freeway network is scheduled to begin next spring. 
Officials predict work on the network linked to Hyperion will start in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Sewage is forever, that is our motto in this business," said Earle Hartling, 
water reuse coordinator for the Sanitation Districts, which distributes about 
half of the reclaimed water from its 10 reclamation treatment plants. "No 
matter how bad a drought gets, there will always be people taking showers, 
brushing their teeth, washing their clothes and flushing their toilets. There 
will always be water coming down." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District, which acts as a wholesaler of imported water 
to local water districts throughout Southern California, has projected that 
supplies could fall short of demand by up to 12% in the coming year. The agency 
is urging its member communities to restrict water consumption and has warned 
that mandatory rationing may be necessary if conditions do not improve. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all in this together," said Jack van der Linden, head of Paramount's 
water department, which plans to irrigate about half of its greenbelt areas 
with reclaimed water from the Century Freeway project. "The problem with the 
(recycled) water is you know where it comes from. Once you get over that 
notion, you have no problem." 
</P>
<P>
The five-member West Basin district board, representing cities from Malibu to 
Rancho Palos Verdes, is expected to signal its commitment to the Hyperion 
project next week by appropriating $375,000 for a detailed engineering report 
and an environmental review. Thus far, the West Basin district and the 
Metropolitan Water District have jointly funded a $25,000 study of the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We are basically coming up with a new water supply," said West Basin board 
member Ed Little of Culver City. "We are getting a great deal of cooperation 
from (Chevron and Mobil oil companies) because we will be able to provide them 
with a consistent supply of water. Right now, we could technically shut down 
the refineries if the drought conditions continue." 
</P>
<P>
Rod Spackman, spokesman for the Chevron refinery in El Segundo, said the 
company would use the reclaimed water in cooling towers and for landscaping. A 
consultant's report released last month estimates that Chevron could use 4.2 
billion gallons of reclaimed water a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are enthusiastic about any program that would help improve our water use," 
Spackman said. "We are trying to find a variety of applications to meet our 
water-reduction goals." 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials expect to inject about one-third of the reclaimed 
water from Hyperion into the ground between Los Angeles International Airport 
and Torrance beach to serve as a barrier preventing salt water from intruding 
into coastal aquifers. The aquifers, underground layers of porous rock and 
sand, serve as a major source of drinking water for coastal communities. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called West Coast Basin Barrier Project now injects potable water 
supplied by the Metropolitan Water District. Officials estimate that they could 
save about 8 billion gallons of MWD water annually if they converted to 
reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the variety of potential users, the proposed reclamation plant near 
Hyperion would produce water with different levels of treatment. For instance, 
water used for irrigation of public areas, such as parks and golf courses, 
would have to meet standards set by the state Department of Health Services for 
bacteriological quality. Signs also would have to be posted notifying the 
public that the facilities are irrigated with reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
Hartling, the water reuse expert for the Sanitation Districts, said he often 
drinks the reclaimed water when giving tours of reclamation treatment plants, 
although the water is not intended for human consumption and cannot be 
distributed for potable uses. He said he drinks the water to demonstrate how 
safe it is. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been doing it for five years, and I have never been sick," Hartling 
said. "The taste is a little chlorine-like because we have a residual of about 
2.5 parts per million of chlorine to prevent regrowth of bacteria and virus in 
the redistribution system. It also keeps the slime growth to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials, under pressure to find ways to reuse waste water, 
have embraced the Hyperion proposal, and have even suggested that waste water 
from the sewage plant be distributed further east to cities along the Century 
Freeway corridor. Less than 1% of the city's waste water is reclaimed for use 
outside sewage treatment plants.

2 EXPRESSWAYS PROPOSED NEAR DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peak-hour traffic congestion through Diamond Bar would be alleviated by the 
construction of two expressways linking San Bernardino, Los Angeles and Orange 
counties, a consultant's report shows. 
</P>
<P>
The expressways would be 10- and 12-mile extensions of Tonner Canyon Road and 
Soquel Canyon Road, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
They would be expected to siphon rush-hour congestion from the Pomona (60) and 
Orange (57) freeways, as well as from surface streets that freeway motorists 
frequently use as detours. The report says traffic in Diamond Bar along Diamond 
Bar Boulevard and Grand Avenue would be cut at least by half. 
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study by Orange-based Parsons Brinckerhoff, Quade &amp; Douglas 
Inc. lists a variety of options -- from building no roads at all to 
constructing both as six-lane, 50 m.p.h. expressways -- and shows the resulting 
effect on traffic levels. The three counties have not made any decisions about 
whether to build the roads or how to finance them. The report suggests a toll 
charge on either or both roads, and a later phase of the study will explore 
that option. 
</P>
<P>
The $195,000 study, commissioned by Orange and San Bernardino counties, is 
scheduled to be released Thursday. A copy was obtained last week by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
If the study findings become reality, a prime beneficiary would be Diamond Bar 
Boulevard, which often becomes clogged with bumper-to-bumper cars trying to 
bypass the 2 1/2-mile junction of the Pomona and Orange freeways. With the two 
expressways in place, the report says, traffic on Diamond Bar Boulevard would 
be reduced to about 20,000 cars a day compared to 52,000 without the new roads. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Diamond Bar have been pushing for speedy construction of the 
proposed expressways, expecting an onslaught of traffic problems this 
September, when an extension of Grand Avenue through San Bernardino County is 
scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Avenue will connect the rapidly growing community of Chino Hills with the 
Pomona Freeway via Diamond Bar. City officials, fearing the worst, had tried to 
delay the opening by erecting a fence and wooden barricades across Grand 
Avenue. The barricades went up, but Diamond Bar officials decided to remove 
them in September, after San Bernardino promised $1.2 million in road 
improvements and cooperation in building new streets. 
</P>
<P>
There would be trade-offs in reducing traffic along Grand Avenue and other 
surface streets. The report says the proposed roads would exacerbate congestion 
on Carbon Canyon Road in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years from now, as many as 88,000 cars would use the portion of Carbon 
Canyon east of Valley View Avenue if the new roads are built. Without the 
roads, 42,000 cars would travel on Carbon Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a portion of Soquel Canyon Road would cross a corner of Chino 
Hills State Park, eliminating a habitat for the southwestern pond turtle. 
Tonner Canyon Road would pass through the Firestone Boy Scout Reservation.

SAN MARINO COUNCIL STUDIES WAYS TO BOOST SCHOOL BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Marino City Council, concerned about "dire financial straits" in the 
affluent city's school system, voted unanimously Wednesday to ask city staff 
members to find ways to shift money to schools from city programs. 
</P>
<P>
The budget crunch is caused by shrinking state revenues due to falling 
enrollment in the schools, Councilman Michael Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Gary Richards said the district has cut back on textbook 
allowances and janitorial services, and has reduced in-school nursing 
"severely." The high school dropped choral music several years ago, Richards 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The school board will vote June 26 on a $10.3-million budget for the coming 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
While the school budget is administered by the school board, the council may 
legally shift city money to school programs, City Atty. Steve Dorsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the City Council on Wednesday approved a $7.6-million city operating 
budget and allocated $953,600 for capital improvements in the coming fiscal 
year.

CERRITOS BLOSSOMS EVEN AS OTHER CITIES SCRAMBLE TO BEAT THE DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CERRITOS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While surrounding cities may see their dichondra die and their park plantings 
perish as the drought drags on, Cerritos has plenty of water to keep its 
fountains bubbling, its artificial lakes full, its 24 parks green, and its 
abundant street landscaping lush. 
</P>
<P>
And is the city gloating? 
</P>
<P>
"I would never use that term," Mayor Ann B. Joynt said mockingly. "We never 
gloat, though we may be accused of it." 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos became the first city in Southeast Los Angeles County to rely 
exclusively on reclaimed water to irrigate all its public lands, largely 
because it wanted to cut its water bills. By 1985, the cost of watering its two 
dozen parks and its generously planted median strips had reached $157,000 a 
year and was still rising. Reclaimed water cost about two-thirds less than 
ordinary drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
So the city began installing a second water system, laying pipes under its 
streets to carry the reclaimed water -- waste water that is chemically treated 
until it is pure enough to use on landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it when it needed to be done, and now every other city is trying to 
figure out how it's going to be done," the mayor said. The city also uses 
reclaimed water in its fountains and the artificial lakes in its parks. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the fourth summer of drought, other cities are trying to come up 
with ways to conserve water and keep the turf in their parks and the shrubbery 
in their median strips from dying. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, for example, has pledged to cut back watering in its parks and median 
strips by 25% this summer. "There's a difference between lush and healthy, and 
we're going for healthy," said William A. Ralph, Downey's public works 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Downey is one of several Southeast area cities participating in a plan by the 
Central Basin Municipal Water District to pipe reclaimed water from the Los 
Coyotes Sewage Treatment Plant. The plant, at the intersection of the Artesia 
and San Gabriel River freeways, is operated by the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts. 
</P>
<P>
However, the system will not be operational until September, 1992, meaning that 
those cities may have to weather two more drought summers. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach has a reclaimed-water system, although some small parks have yet to 
be included, city officials say. Lakewood began installing such a system about 
a year ago, buying the reclaimed water from Cerritos, and now plans to hook 
into the Central Basin system. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos also buys reclaimed water from the Los Coyotes plant. 
</P>
<P>
The city, with the aid of a state grant, began installing its 22-mile system in 
1985. The project was completed about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We're visionaries," said Barry Rabbitt, who was a member of the Cerritos City 
Council when the plan for the reclaimed-water system was developed. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos was committed to a green, park-like setting for its community, Rabbitt 
recalls, but the council was worried about rising water bills and knew that if 
a drought occurred, the city might lose its turf and other flora if water was 
rationed. 
</P>
<P>
The city golf course next to the Los Coyotes plant was already being watered 
with reclaimed water, so the council decided to expand the use of reclaimed 
water to the rest of the city. The piping project cost $8 million, of which the 
state Water Resources Board paid $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Now Cerritos sells the reclaimed water to other large water users in the city 
such as school districts and business parks, using a total of 571 million 
gallons last year, according to Ron Babel, the city's water superintendent. The 
next step, said Mayor Joynt, is to figure out a plan for hooking up homeowner 
associations to the system. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Grebbien, district engineer for the Central Basin, said sprinkler 
systems owned by homeowners associations, such as those in condominium 
projects, can hook into the system. Individual houses, however, cannot be 
hooked up, Grebbien said, because there is too great a possibility that someone 
will take a gulp of water from a hose.

Superior Court Judge Theodore Piatt last week postponed a ruling on whether to 
dismiss lawsuits filed by two ex-employees of the conservative Christian media 
empire Focus on the Family. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Moegerle, a former co-host of the Focus on the Family radio program, 
which is heard on 1,450 stations in the United States and abroad, claims that 
he was forced to resign in 1987 after he divorced his first wife and announced 
that he intended to marry a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
His new wife, Carolyn, who worked for Focus on the Family as a secretary and 
coordinator of children's video materials, claims in a separate suit that she 
too was forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he was fascinated by the constitutional issues that have been raised, 
Piatt said the lawsuits may hinge on whether Focus on the Family, which 
promotes family life and Christian values through radio broadcasts and 
publications, is a religious institution protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Piatt asked attorneys for both sides to concentrate on this and several other 
issues when they return to court July 25 to argue a motion by Focus on the 
Family and its founder, James Dobson, to dismiss the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson and his lawyers contend that the suits should be dismissed because Focus 
on the Family is a religious organization protected from court scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
They also contend that Moegerle and his wife, who took the name 
Alexander-Moegerle after their marriage, resigned voluntarily. And they argue 
that Focus on the Family had ample reasons to dismiss them anyway, because they 
violated the organization's teachings on the permanency of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David Warren, representing the couple, said they were singled out for 
unfair treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"There are multiple individuals in the organization and on the board of 
directors who are divorced and remarried," he said, and yet none have had their 
marital histories scrutinized or been forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Focus on the Family, which is based in Pomona, has 750 employees. Officials of 
the nonprofit organization, which earned nearly $55 million last year and this 
year expects to take in $63 million, announced on Thursday that Focus on the 
Family may sell its Pomona property and relocate to Colorado Springs, Colo.

DUMP SITE STUDIED FOR REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The BKK Corp. landfill, once one of the nation's busiest toxic dumps, may 
become a city redevelopment area under a plan being considered by West Covina 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment officials since 1988 have been preparing an environmental impact 
report on potential development at the dump site, which may be transformed into 
a business park. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour public hearing on the report last week, the City Council, 
acting jointly as the West Covina Redevelopment Agency, postponed action until 
June 25. The council and agency must approve the report before the property can 
be designated for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
The BKK site is the largest of eight potential redevelopment areas examined in 
the environmental report. When developed, the parcels, totaling 1,119 acres, 
could generate $1 million to $2 million annually in property taxes for West 
Covina, city Redevelopment Project Manager Matthew Fertal said. In exchange, 
the agency could offer property owners or developers financial help or other 
assistance in constructing improvements, such as sewers. 
</P>
<P>
All five residents who spoke at the joint hearing last week voiced concerns 
about the proposed redevelopment designations. Action on the environmental 
report was postponed to give city employees the chance to respond to the 
criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers were troubled by the environmental legacy of the 583-acre BKK 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The firm ceased accepting hazardous waste in 1984, four months after 21 
families in nearby homes were ordered to evacuate because of a methane gas leak 
from the site. The landfill, which continues to accept 8,000 to 10,000 tons of 
non-hazardous trash daily, will shut down completely in five years, BKK 
President Ken Kazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to build a business park on parts of the property adjacent to the 
landfill in a joint venture with Newport Beach-based Davis Developments, he 
said. According to federal regulations, the land above and immediately 
surrounding the actual dump site must remain open space, he added. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director Pat Haley said preliminary plans submitted by the 
partnership show the 2.3-million-square-foot business park would sit on 233 
acres north and west of the landfill area. Retail use is being proposed for 
about 426,000 square feet of the complex, and the rest would be put to 
light-industrial use, such as research and development offices, she said. 
</P>
<P>
If his property is designated for redevelopment, Kazarian would be able to ask 
the city for financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand we will have project financing available that wouldn't otherwise 
be available," Kazarian said, adding that he is not yet sure whether he will 
request city help. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment designation is one way in which the city hopes to recoup 
revenue it will lose when BKK ceases operation as a dump. BKK has generated 
about $3 million for the city each year in business license taxes, city 
Accounting Manager Basil Panas said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also complained Monday that the BKK development would generate huge 
increases in traffic, especially along Azusa Avenue, the city's most congested 
corridor. They said the environmental report did not adequately explore ways to 
solve the potential traffic woes. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Steve Herfert agreed. "It's going to be a zoo down there," he said. 
Herfert added that he is concerned about the city's liability in paving the way 
for development near a former dump. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, resident Royall Brown, a director of the Upper San Gabriel Valley 
Municipal Water District, said the report did not detail the levels of 
contaminants in ground water at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Such data would be essential to any future buyer of the land. "Any buyer of any 
property of BKK ought to have (that information) available to them so they'll 
know what their liabilities are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services is conducting a series of studies on 
the landfill's environmental impact on the neighborhood, city Community 
Services Manager Mike Miller said. Reports on cancer occurrences and risks are 
to be released later this summer. A report analyzing birth abnormalities will 
take longer to prepare, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the other proposed redevelopment areas -- which include vacant 
lots, surplus school property and a few homes -- would be used to build 
residences, stores and offices.

NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE ON POLICE CHIEF SET; 
</P>

LONG BEACH: THE MOVE REFLECTS TURMOIL IN THE DEPARTMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN ENGAGED 
IN BITTER LABOR DISPUTES.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Police Officers Assn., citing low morale among its members, is planning to 
conduct a no-confidence vote against Police Chief Lawrence Binkley. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said last week that they will mail ballots to members' homes in 
coming weeks and count the votes at a membership meeting July 17. 
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary petition used to gauge support for a no-confidence vote, union 
officials said they gathered signatures of more than a third of the 600 union 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The move reflects continued turmoil in the Long Beach Police Department, where 
the rank and file and management have engaged in bitter disputes for years. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the two sides settled a protracted contract battle, and 
Binkley and other city officials expressed hope for a smoother labor-management 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members said they were surprised by the union's move because 
they believed that relations between the two sides had improved. 
</P>
<P>
Union President Mike Tracy said, however, that members are still upset over 
increased disciplinary actions by the department last year. The number of 
internal investigations of police officers' conduct in 1989 was about double 
the number of investigations the previous year, according to department 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that people are still feeling the pain of last year's sharp 
increase in internal investigations and reprimands," Tracy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've probably started another war," Terry Holland, the union's vice 
president, told about 75 officers at a membership meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
City officials criticized the vote, saying the union was reacting to the 
results of the recent city elections, in which all of the union-supported 
candidates were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just about the stupidest thing I've seen," said Councilman Les Robbins, a 
former president of the union that represents Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"I am tired of the constant bickering," said Councilman Jeff Kellogg, one of 
several council members who said the no-confidence vote was the result of the 
union's poor showing in the recent election. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Clark said he expects the vote to have "an adverse effect on the 
service level" in the Police Department. He said response time has slowed while 
crime continues to escalate throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the community that gets hurt ultimately by the actions of the officers," 
Clark said. "It's something that needs to be resolved for the benefit of the 
department and the community." 
</P>
<P>
A no-confidence vote would jeopardize plans for a November ballot measure that 
would ask voters to approve a special property tax levy to hire 75 new 
officers, Robbins and others said. A similar ballot measure recently failed to 
generate the necessary two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members have started working on plans for another ballot measure. 
But if there is a no-confidence vote, Robbins said, "people will ask why should 
we pay extra for more angry, bitter cops." 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they expect to call a vote expressing their backing for 
the chief during their meeting Tuesday. Binkley was unavailable for comment, 
and Assistant Police Chief Eugene Brizzolara declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Mike White, a union board member, said he suggested the petition to 
measure interest in a no-confidence vote in response to continued "pressure by 
members." Several members said the union should have taken a no-confidence vote 
earlier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers last approved a no-confidence measure in 1978, asking city officials 
to fire then-Chief Carl J. Calkins. He resigned the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy said the no-confidence vote, if approved, would suggest a range of 
alternatives, from changing policy to firing the chief.

AMBASSADOR COLLEGE A FINALIST IN SMITHSONIAN COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ambassador College in Pasadena is among 44 finalists competing for 
Computerworld Smithsonian Awards. Nine winners will be announced June 25 at an 
awards dinner in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The winning entries will be included in the Smithsonian Institution's exhibit 
entitled, "The Information Age: People, Information, Technology," which opened 
May 9. 
</P>
<P>
The awards were established last year to honor the innovative use of 
information technology. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador College was nominated for a project called the Swiftnet system, 
which uses a personal computer-controlled telecommunication switch that allows 
people who work at home to communicate, via touch-tone telephone, with 
supervisors thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The finalists were selected from 250 entrants. Winners will be chosen in nine 
categories: business, education, environment, finance, government, 
manufacturing, media, medicine and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of these awards is to raise awareness among individuals, 
businesses and nations about meaningful new applications of technology. 
</P>
<P>
"By increasing recognition of these heroic achievements, we hope to provide 
benefit to the greatest number of people," said Fritz Landmann, Computerworld's 
president and publisher.

AZUSA'S POLICE CHIEF MAY FINALLY GET POMONA POST

The Police Department, without a permanent police chief since Richard Tefank 
was fired last September, may get a new chief this week. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Julio Fuentes said he will recommend that the City Council 
on Monday confirm his choice of Azusa Police Chief Lloyd Wood, 50, who has 28 
years' experience in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, who has been under consideration for the job since February, had insisted 
earlier that he would accept the appointment only with a long-term employment 
agreement. Wood said he has given up his insistence on a three-year agreement 
and will accept the appointment to serve at the pleasure of the city 
administrator and council. 
</P>
<P>
He said he decided to take the job without the security of an employment 
contract because it had become controversial and he wants the job. He said he 
wants the challenge of working with a larger department in a larger city. 
</P>
<P>
After nine years in Azusa, he said, "I've done everything I can do. There's no 
challenge anymore." He said the departure of Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, 
ousted in a recall election earlier this month, had nothing to do with his 
decision. Bryant had opposed Wood for the chief's job. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said he will recommend that the council confirm the appointment of 
Wood, effective July 18.

DROPPING THE X; 
</P>
<P>
RATING MOVIES IS A SLIPPERY BUSINESS, AND AFTER 22 YEARS THE SEVEREST OF 
RATINGS HAS OUTLIVED WHATEVER USEFULNESS IT HAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is clear that the dreaded, hated X has got to go. 
</P>
<P>
In its 22nd year as part of the movies' rating system -- the so-called Valenti 
ratings adopted in November, 1968 -- the X has not only outlived whatever 
usefulness it ever had, it has clouded perceptions of how the ratings are meant 
to work, and it has now become the focus for legal attacks on the system. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the X was an awkward member of the G-PG-R family. It was like 
an adopted child that did not get along well with the natural kids. It was the 
only non-copyrighted symbol, which meant that anybody could appropriate it. It 
also arrived with a scarlet past, synonymous forever, it seemed, with 
disreputable materials, nude flicks and naughty publications. 
</P>
<P>
Until it became part of the ratings, X never identified anything more positive 
than the spot on the map in pirate tales where the treasure was buried. It was 
a selling point, not a warning. Once it was in the system, however, X marked 
not only exploitative films but those films of unquestioned artistic intent 
that the raters judged to be unsuitable because of their intensity for viewers 
under the age of 17 or 18. 
</P>
<P>
That has always been the mischief: The inflammatory X applied equally to films 
of merit like "Last Tango in Paris" and "Midnight Cowboy" and to other films 
only a distributor could love -- and which may or may not have actually been 
rated by the system at all. 
</P>
<P>
It was, in fact, a further mischief that any film not rated by Motion Picture 
Assn. of America's CARA -- the Classification and Rating Administration -- is 
technically regarded as an X. And since the X is not copyrighted, it could be 
self-applied by a distributor to any film for which X was a selling point, not 
a handicap. 
</P>
<P>
What remains true is that some publications will not accept advertising for 
X-rated films. (The Times goes on a case-by-case basis, checking its critics' 
opinions on whether a given X-rated or unrated film has aspirations to artistic 
merit.) 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, and because the number of play dates for X-rated films is also 
limited, most contracts between distributor and filmmaker call for delivery of 
a finished film of a certain maximum length and of a particular rating, 
occasionally a PG or PG-13, more often these days an R but absolutely not an X. 
</P>
<P>
The push now is to dump the X, with its overtones of the illicit, the spicy and 
the non-meritorious. Going to A (the most frequently mentioned alternative) or 
"17" or "NC" (for No Children) would end a particular mischief. 
</P>
<P>
But it will not solve the root problem that the X itself has always posed. The 
new rating would not distinguish between the tough films of undeniable artistic 
intent (however well or ill they may come off) and the films whose quantities 
of sex and violence most viewers would agree are merely exploitative. (The 
exploitation films are seldom submitted for ratings anyway, but there are 
borderline exceptions.) 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult task for the rating board members -- and the hardest to make 
both the public and indeed the industry itself understand -- is that they are 
supposed to be rendering quantitative judgments on the film at hand, not 
qualitative or subjective judgments. 
</P>
<P>
The members of CARA's board, themselves parents, are in effect meant to be 
proxies for all parents. They are asked to judge that most parents would agree, 
let's say, that Film A is acceptable for audiences of every age, Film B too 
intense for small children but all right for early teen-agers, Film C 
acceptable for maturer teen-agers, Film D fine for an accompanied teen-ager, 
and so on. 
</P>
<P>
It's a slippery business and the raters themselves are not always unanimous. 
But whether they think Film A is a tedious bore or a soaring triumph is quite 
another question, and not for the raters to say (whatever they may feel 
privately). It certainly ought not to be for the raters to say. And it would be 
a new mischief for the raters to assign A or 17 or NC for the good intense 
films but retain X for what MPAA president Jack Valenti calls smut films. 
</P>
<P>
Making such distinctions as between A and X would, not least, turn the raters 
into psychics, trying to probe the minds of filmmakers and discern whether 
their intentions were honorable or dishonorable. 
</P>
<P>
Applying the ratings is complicated by what is actually a virtue of the present 
ratings system: its flexibility. Unlike the ironclad "Don'ts" of the Hays Code 
(which was in force from 1934 to 1968), the Valenti system has a built-in 
flexibility that can reflect changing community standards and tolerances. 
"Ryan's Daughter," controversial when it was first rated R in 1970 for a brief 
semi-nude love scene, would very likely draw a PG or PG-13 today. 
</P>
<P>
The present ratings offer only the most general guidelines, placing 
responsibility on the filmmakers and offering them great freedom of expression 
-- at the price of a particular rating. 
</P>
<P>
That price continues to be the point of friction, although in the face of more 
than 10,000 films rated, the arguments, while very conspicuous, have been 
relatively infrequent. 
</P>
<P>
To cite one example of changing standards, the f-word, which used to demand an 
automatic R, no longer does, although excessive use of profanity is still 
grounds for an R. Violence appears to be a prime determinant now as before, 
although the raters apparently perceive that some violence is less intense and 
more make-believe than other violence. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Valenti had steadfastly resisted changes in the system on 
grounds that it was fairly complicated to begin with and that it was dangerous 
to complicate it further. There have been frequent cries for more explanations 
as to why a film was rated PG, R or X, for example. Expanded ratings were tried 
experimentally in the Midwest a few years ago. They were reportedly well 
received, but the experiment was not repeated and the explanatory ratings were 
not adopted. 
</P>
<P>
But the lawsuits filed against the Motion Picture Assn. of America and its 
ratings by the distributors of Pedro Almodovar's "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" and 
the docudrama "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" will, whatever their merits, 
be costly and time-consuming to defend. They also arrive on a wave of 
complaint, from critics and creators, about the consequences of having to 
accept the X rating, or to edit a film to achieve an R rating. 
</P>
<P>
A larger question is whether the industry's voluntary self-policing in the form 
of the ratings is still necessary. The original Hays Code system in 1934 was a 
countermeasure to the Catholic Church's newly launched Legion of Decency, which 
was in turn a reflection of a noisy stirring across Middle America against what 
was perceived as the low moral tone of the movies. 
</P>
<P>
The renewal of the system in 1968 reflected many changes in society, including 
the arrival of television and the large-scale erosion of the film audience. It 
also acknowledged that the urge to censor the movies had not disappeared; 
several cities still had, and have, censor boards. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar two years ago over "The Last Temptation of Christ" would suggest 
that the movies, despite their diminished position in the world of 
entertainment, still have the power to command fear and loathing as well as 
affection. And the pressure on public libraries to ban books as innocuous as 
"Tarzan" and a new edition of "Little Red Riding Hood" is a further suggestion 
that the vigilante mentality is extant. 
</P>
<P>
The X rating has addressed not only parental guidance but also the prevailing 
legal situation on obscenity, which is that some material may be found to be 
actionable as obscene if purveyed to children but not if marketed to adults. 
The X has thus been a warning to exhibitors that legal prudence demanded they 
police their box offices. 
</P>
<P>
Putting the new rating system in place was Valenti's first major achievement 
after he became president of the MPAA in 1966. It was undoubtedly a triumph of 
political legerdemain, winning endorsement for the system not only from the 
major studios that make up the MPAA but from the distributors of foreign films 
and, above all, from the theater owners who were being asked to bar patrons 
from certain films or insist that others be accompanied by adults. 
</P>
<P>
If Valenti elects to scuttle the X, as now appears possible, he should have no 
trouble getting the change past his constituents. The dismissal of X has the 
strongest appeal of all: enlightened self-interest.

Despite its vibrant Japanese community, Los Angeles has not seen a major 
exhibition of contemporary art from Japan in living memory. At one time such an 
oversight might have been explicable, if not forgivable. For years, nobody was 
certain if the nation produced new art that could be called either Japanese or 
contemporary. The rare exhibitions that appeared in the States tended to 
evidence an art so derivative of Western models -- and often selected because 
it was derivative -- that there seemed to be nothing Japanese about it except a 
little gold leaf to recall the folding screens of the Momoyama period. Evidence 
reinforced the old-fashioned American prejudice that all the Japanese could 
really do was make cheap knock-offs of our stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Fox, the Los Angeles County Museum of Arts curator of contemporary art, 
is fairly incensed about the way the occasional U.S. shows selected copy-cat 
work, calling the practice "An act of colonialism, an abrogation of 
responsibility. This culture puts high value on originality. Not looking for it 
in Japanese art is a mockery." 
</P>
<P>
Starting today, Fox and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will try to fix 
that when they unveil "A Primal Spirit," a major effort devoted to the work of 
10 Japanese sculptors virtually unknown on these shores. If the show (which 
runs until Aug. 26) turned out to be a raving turkey it would still be 
significant as part of an ever-widening trend toward attaching art to the 
social, economic and political issues of the day. Glasnost in the Soviet Union 
immediately brought Russian art to the States. You can bet there is a Polish 
show on the way after events in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental art lovers have long doted on traditional Japanese art, from its 
popular woodblock prints to spectacular armored helmets and rock gardens. 
Today, everyone is curious about Japan because it is an economic superpower and 
goggled by its ability to produce mass-market gewgaws of almost spooky 
perfection. But people like Fox who are interested in visual culture have found 
cold comfort in scanning American art magazines and journals for news of 
Japanese contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
"They catch on quickly to trends in Germany or Italy because Europe is attached 
to the commercial loop," he says of the system of dealers, collectors, 
galleries, museums and critics in the European-American axis. But Japan is out 
of it. Thus when he was invited in 1987 by Tokyo's Hara Museum to act as guest 
curator for a traveling exhibition of Japanese art, he found little in print to 
guide him. He made a two-week reconnaissance mission to Japan and found the 
scene quite unlike the well-oiled Euro-American system. Artists were scattered 
and few had established studios to visit. 
</P>
<P>
Fox found that Japan, roughly the size of California, has about 600 museums, 
but they tend to be rigidly conservative and, excepting the Hara, exhibit 
little beyond lackluster annual roundups of the art of the moment. Sounds like 
the old LACMA surveys back in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Fox was forced to break new ground. Talking to every Japanese artnik he could 
find, he discovered virtually the only way to piece together a picture of the 
amorphous phenomenon. He left his card everywhere, soliciting catalogues from 
museum survey and rental-gallery exhibitions and he launched word-of-mouth 
solicitations for slides and biographies. Curating is not all glamour. 
</P>
<P>
Today he thinks the art he finally culled for "A Primal Spirit" after four 
years of research is, "radical and unique in the world." 
</P>
<P>
He chose sculpture because he found striking affinities between otherwise 
unrelated Japanese artists plying that trade. "I went with an open mind. The 
show suggested itself to me. Sculpture was the form that was compelling, 
insistent and persistent. Only two of the 10 artists included have dawning 
international reputations, Toshikasu Endo and Tadashi Kawamata." Few of the 
others have shown outside Japan and none knew of the existence of all the 
others. Fox says he avoided learning too much of established local reputations 
in order to keep an open mind. In short, "A Primal Spirit" is his baby. 
</P>
<P>
He says there is good painting being done in Japan but other off-the-record 
curatorial opinion calls it "vapid." He says there is enough markedly different 
work being done "for a dozen other shows," but he was fascinated by the 
combination of indigenous aesthetic and international reach in these works. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some controversy over there suggesting I've created a new 
segregation, a new japonisme," Fox said, referring to an old Western habit of 
appreciating Japanese art as something quaint and exotic. 
</P>
<P>
The other day he took time from installing the exhibition to talk about it, and 
he brought along two participating artists, Kawamata and Takamasa Kuniyasu, who 
had arrived early to supervise their complicated site-specific installations. 
The pair turned out to refreshingly subvert any sort of stereotype anyone might 
be tempted to apply to this art other than certain shared traditional Japanese 
attitudes, such as a sense of oneness with nature. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamata, 37, was born in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido. In 1987 he 
was included in Germany's prestigious "Documenta" and the Sao Paulo Bienal. He 
is a self-avowed realist. Kuniyasu, 33, is also from Hokkaido but met Kawamata 
for the first time here. Never shown previously outside the Orient, he is best 
decribed as a mystic. 
</P>
<P>
The artists seemed to politely disagree on most questions raised. I say seemed 
to because the circumstances warranted the presence of two translators. 
Sometimes, the four consulted for minutes on a question only to come up with a 
one paragraph answer that didn't seem to address the original inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone did agree that contemporary art in Japan is in a vibrant infancy that 
is invisible to an indifferent Japanese public. There are virtually no 
collectors of contemporary art. And due to the traditional Japanese desire for 
consensus and deference to others' personal honor, criticism is, with rare 
exceptions, favorable. 
</P>
<P>
Japan certainly has dealers who trade in expensive high-powered art, witness 
those who have paid millions for Impressionist paintings at New York auctions. 
But such investment-style dealers have little to do with contemporary art. 
Tokyo boasts about 200 art galleries that display it, but they are for-rent 
spaces. In the West, such galleries are seen as vanity operations no 
self-respecting artist would use; in Japan, that's the way it works. Spaces are 
rented by the week and artists must take care of everything from announcements 
to vernissage and sales, when there are any, according to the sculptors. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamata, who has an athletic presence, said: "It's easy to become an artist in 
Japan but hard to survive unless you have money. Recognition comes hard but 
your chances for it go up with age." 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyasu, bespectacled, willowy and thoughtful, added: "In the West recognition 
moves up like an escalator. In Japan it's more like a freight elevator." 
</P>
<P>
Fox found the climate for contemporary art in Japan comparable to New York in 
the 1940s, when Abstract Expressionism was an underground phenomenon, tiny, 
inbred and obscure. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamata said: "Abstract Expressionism came after America was victorious in 
World War II and became a huge economic power. Now Japan has a big economy." 
</P>
<P>
"Abstract Expressionism had its own revolutionary situation and was devoted to 
the international world," said Kuniyasu. "Now 45 years after the end of the war 
the Japanese are getting to notice their own identity. We're getting 
self-confident about our originality." 
</P>
<P>
That self-confidence comes with an awareness that their best chance for 
recognition is to achieve it first on the international scene and then hope for 
some respect at home. For them, Isamu Noguchi, although Japanese-American, is 
something of a model. He eventually gained reknown that bracketed the world 
from Paris to Tokyo. The cosmopolitan Kawamata smokes Gauloises. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamata has no desire to make what he calls "souvenir style" art. "I don't 
walk in the countryside with the idea of making 'Japanese' art although people 
may see something Japanese in the work. We are not talking Buddhism or 
Shintoism here. My art comes from a more industrial situation, from the kind of 
control and artificiality you find in the city. I am looking for connections. 
Japan has always been in contact with other countries. Our problem is to chose 
from the information that comes to us from outside and thus to choose our 
identity. Of course Japanese are different from Russians or Americans but they 
all sleep, eat and make love. I am looking for those kinds of basic 
connections." 
</P>
<P>
He selected the bridge across the museum's central court as the armature for 
his wood-plank work-in-progress. It starts inside the galleries and works its 
way across the span. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kawamata studied painting in college and admired Jasper Johns, he soon 
discovered he was more interested in arranging space. Some observers find some 
affinity between his work and that of Christo, the great wrapper of bridges and 
canyons. But Kawamata says he is more interested in connecting indoors with out 
and extending his work from the confines of the art world into the sphere of 
ordinary people and events. He likes the social interaction with the real world 
and with people who assist in the projects. 
</P>
<P>
He always works with the same material -- lengths of raw lumber -- so "I won't 
have to think about it." He wants to be "submissive" to the material, an idea 
that looms large among these artists. As the artist in the exhibition who uses 
chemical reaction to create his shapes, they want to cooperate with their work 
rather than try to dominate it as they feel Western artists do. Kawamata once 
compared his lengths of lumber to cancer cells -- either benign or malignant -- 
arranging themselves into various systems and rhythms in the body. He finds 
them analogous to the systems and rhythms of great cities. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Kuniyasu was constructing an environment of lovely smelling pine logs 
to fill up a large gallery in the Anderson building. It's a version of a work 
permanently installed in Japan's northern Aomori prefecture which incorporates 
a real tree with its seasonal changes. 
</P>
<P>
He says the Japanese question is, "Not pertinent to my work. Something Japanese 
may come out in it because I was born in Japan but the question is too logical, 
too Western. I want to pull some essence from the universe, something not 
logical but biological." 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyasu's work demands the kind of simple, repetitive physical labor most 
people find tedious. He says humble work liberates and calms him, leading him 
beyond his individual ego to a deeper and more authentic inner self and to a 
sense of joy in creation. Sounds very Zen. 
</P>
<P>
He says that if he could find words to express his message there would be no 
need to make the work. Similarly, Kawamata says he does the work for himself 
and has no dreams for it other than to eventually find "my own position." 
</P>
<P>
Fox points out that Western art tends to produce art as separate objects that 
are a kind of metaphor for occidental individualism. By contrast he thinks this 
Japanese art reaches out to link with nature and the cosmos. "The effort in 
this exhibition," he said, "is not to categorize, define or separate but to 
allow us to connect with something else."

THERE'S THE BRIGHT SIDE TO LONDON THEATER . . . . . . AND THERE'S THE DARK SIDE 
ON THE WEST END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because most of the hit shows that have arrived on Broadway in recent years 
originate from England, it's tempting to assume that London's West End must be 
flourishing. 
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, this appears to be the case. Hit musicals like "Phantom of 
the Opera," "Miss Saigon," "Aspects of Love" and "Les Miserables" keep London's 
theater box offices busy and their investors smiling. 
</P>
<P>
These are the shows to which tourists will inevitably flock this summer, having 
bought tickets in advance at inflated prices. And these shows perpetuate the 
notion that all is well in the West End. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 42 theaters in the district, seven are housing shows that could fairly 
be described as big hits -- the four named above and "Cats," "Me and my Girl" 
and "Starlight Express." All of these shows are musicals, and four of them bear 
the imprint of the ubiquitous Andrew Lloyd Webber. Yet only "Miss Saigon," 
which opened last fall, is a recent arrival to the West End. "Phantom," "Cats," 
"Les Miserables" and "Starlight Express" have been playing for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Another half-dozen shows, including "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," "Shirley 
Valentine," Willy Russell's musical "Blood Brothers," "Buddy," a musical about 
the late pop singer Buddy Holly, and the Cole Porter revival "Anything Goes," 
have settled into long, profitable runs. 
</P>
<P>
It is perfectly normal for the West End's hit shows to be concentrated in a 
handful of theaters. But in terms of the recent survival rate among new shows, 
the West End is experiencing troubled times. It is plagued by rising costs, 
ticket scalpers and a rash of frankly second-rate new productions. These 
problems have been highlighted since the beginning of May by a run of eagerly 
awaited and much-heralded plays closing prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
The most notable disaster has been "King," a 3-million ($5-million) musical 
dealing with the life and death of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr. It has closed a mere two months after opening to savage reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Another show, "Someone Like You," starring Petula Clark, was also received 
coldly by reviewers. Audiences stayed away in droves, finally dwindling to 25% 
of capacity. Its end came after just over a month, almost forcing its main 
backer, veteran London impresario Harold Fielding, out of business. Fielding is 
now liquidating one of his companies but will continue to invest in West End 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
The same week "Someone Like You" closed, the revival of William Inge's "Bus 
Stop" with Jerry Hall -- which had received mixed notices but intense publicity 
-- took its final curtain after nine weeks of playing to a half-empty theater. 
</P>
<P>
Worse followed. "Look Look," a new work by the highly regarded playwright 
Michael Frayn, wound up after less than a month. This was surprising, as 
Frayn's last play, "Benefactors," received popular and critical raves in London 
and on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Then "A Clockwork Orange," a Royal Shakespeare Company adaptation of Anthony 
Burgess' novel, which had sold out in a limited run at the RSC's Barbican 
theater, folded five weeks after transferring to the West End. 
</P>
<P>
These failures have caused shock waves in London's theater community. Current 
wisdom holds that it is now more difficult than ever to create a hit show in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Many people in the community blame the theater critics of Britain's newspapers, 
who generally panned all the shows that recently closed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our critics are becoming outrageous," complains Fielding, who has staged 35 
musicals in the West End since 1958. "Some of them simply set out to make a 
name for themselves. They have their own pictures at the top of their columns, 
rather than those of the stars." 
</P>
<P>
London critics certainly had a field day with "King." One, John Peter of the 
Sunday Times, dismissed it as "a piece of tedious, muscle-bound mediocrity" and 
complained that opera singer Simon Estes played the title role "with a massive, 
impassive dignity, and the weight and intellectual refinement of a large rock." 
Another, the Observer's Michael Coveney, sniped: "Sanitized vacuity reigns." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, no individual London critic wields the influence to close a show with a 
harsh review in the way the New York Times can affect Broadway productions. And 
it is fair to say that many people in the sparse audiences who attended "King" 
agreed with the critics. In the bar at the interval one night during its first 
week, complete strangers were striking up conversations with each other, 
shaking their heads and murmuring about the dire quality of the production. 
</P>
<P>
"I hesitate to criticize another production, but it may be that the subject 
matter was all wrong," says Harold Fielding of the "King" fiasco. Certainly, 
the story of a slain Black American civil rights leader held little appeal for 
the "coach parties" -- the busloads of (usually) middle-aged theatergoers from 
the suburbs and provinces who buy blocks of theater tickets and tend to prefer 
cheery, bland entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
That description better fits Fielding's show "Someone Like You," a Civil 
War-themed musical with a romantic story and a star in Petula Clark who might 
appeal to the coach parties. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is, it was charming when it played out of town in small 
theaters," says Fielding. "Something happened when it came to the West End. It 
lost some of its charm." 
</P>
<P>
The backers of "Bus Stop" may have overrated the box-office appeal of Jerry 
Hall in the lead role. Hall, the international model who is perhaps best known 
as Mick Jagger's girlfriend, received charitable reviews for her work in the 
role that Marilyn Monroe made famous on film, but Inge's play seemed dated and 
scarcely worth reviving. 
</P>
<P>
Pallid reviews killed off the prospects of "Look Look," a play, ironically, 
about a theater audience. After its closure was announced, playwright Frayn 
wrote an article for a Sunday newspaper, which recounted the play's problems 
and concluded that "Look Look" was simply not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Shakespeare Company, with its severe financial problems (see box, 
Page 7), was immensely heartened by the standing-room-only audiences packing 
the Barbican for the limited run of "A Clockwork Orange." The RSC hoped that 
transferring it from the Barbican to a commercial West End theater would ease 
its deficit and duplicate the company's success with "Les Miserables," which 
also transferred to the West End. 
</P>
<P>
But "A Clockwork Orange" did not appeal to traditional theatergoers. At the 
Barbican, audiences were of the kind one might expect to see at a rock venue, 
and many were clearly drawn to the production to hear the score -- composed by 
Bono Hewson and The Edge, two members of the rock group U2. 
</P>
<P>
Fielding thinks the quality of new West End shows is secondary to the problem 
of rising costs and admissions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem is that the touts (scalpers) have got hold of too many 
tickets," outside a theater. At the average bureau de change in the West End, 
it's the same. You pay 50 ($83) for a 25 ($41.50) ticket -- if you're lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there are tourists staying in London at big hotels, who ask the porter at 
the desk to get them tickets for a big show. They're prepared to pay 100 ($166) 
a ticket for the service. It all helps to force prices up." Recent government 
legislation aimed at curbing the scalper activity, says Fielding, has had only 
a limited effect. 
</P>
<P>
Other costs are squeezing theater backers, claims Fielding. "If a show is 
(panned) by critics, it needs money in the kitty to keep going," he said. "If 
you make a judgment that your show is right despite what the critics say, then 
you go out and market it differently. But television commercials are exorbitant 
now. For a 20-second spot during the 10 o'clock news, you have to pay 
20,000-25,000 ($33,200-$41,500)." 
</P>
<P>
Union problems play a part in the West End's woes too. Fielding and many other 
producers want theater unions to show more flexibility in a deal under which 
they are paid up to double time for working Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could make it economic to have one performance on Sunday, probably a 
matinee, most of us would be happy to see theaters dark Mondays," says 
Fielding. "It would create a lot of extra revenue. This has worked well on 
Broadway, and it would benefit the West End tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
So who would try to open a new show in the West End, assuming their name wasn't 
Lloyd Webber? Oddly, the combined problems of rising costs, harsh critics, 
scalpers and unions don't deter backers intent on pursuing the chance of a 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, a new 1-million ($1.66-million) musical called "Bernadette," 
based on the life of the visionary 19th-Century Saint Bernadette of Lourdes, 
opens at the Dominion Theatre. Implausibly, it was written by two 
schoolteachers, Maureen and Gwyn Hughes. Producer Jim Murray raised one-fifth 
of his budget by persuading 2,000 people to gamble 100 ($166) each on its 
success. Will they get their money back? Hope springs eternal.

DARK NIGHTS FOR THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GRITTEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the commercial theaters in London's West End are finding it hard to present 
new shows with popular appeal, their problems seem trivial compared to the woes 
of the government-funded Royal Shakespeare Company. 
</P>
<P>
The RSC, with a current 2.9-million ($4.8-million) deficit, is closing its two 
London theaters, the Barbican and the adjacent Pit, for four months in November 
to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems we have no other option," said Terry Hands, RSC artistic director and 
chief executive. "To stay open could risk total closure." 
</P>
<P>
The temporary shutdown of the two theaters will save 1.3 million ($2.15 
million). The RSC's annual tour of Britain's provincial cities has also been 
canceled, and its current season consists of a mere 19 productions -- about 
half the normal total. 
</P>
<P>
The RSC had hoped that "A Clockwork Orange," which did turn-away business at 
the Barbican in a limited run, would be a success on its transfer to a 
commercial West End theater. But those hopes foundered when the show closed 
after a month. A long "Clockwork Orange" run would have helped RSC finances 
considerably; its hit production of "Les Miserables" at the West End's Palace 
Theatre brings in 1 million ($1.6 million) a year. 
</P>
<P>
Hands noted that the RSC has an annual budget of 19 million ($31.5 million). 
"We receive 6 million ($9.9 million) from the government and the rest we make 
or raise ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We averaged 75% capacity attendances this 
</P>
<P>
year as we did last year, when the average attendance at a West End play is 
below 50%. We are being asked to set box-office targets that demand perpetual 
miracles. The policy does not work." 
</P>
<P>
Hands likes to put the RSC deficit into perspective by observing that it is 
equivalent to what Britain "spends by the hour on defense." 
</P>
<P>
He wants Britain's Arts Minister, Richard Luce, to raise funding levels to 
those recommended by the government's own review of arts expenditures in 1984. 
Had the recommendations of that review been implemented, he said, the RSC would 
have received another 5 million ($8.3 million) in subsidy and would not be in 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
In general, pleas for increased arts subsidies do not fall on sympathetic ears 
in Westminster. Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government adheres strictly to 
a philosophy of allowing market forces to prevail -- and insists arts 
organizations look to the bottom line in their operations. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's major subsidized arts companies -- the RSC, the National Theatre, 
Covent Garden and the English National Opera (in order of support received) -- 
all want future government subsidies to be linked to a cost of living index so 
they will not fall victims to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Their feelings are echoed by the RSC's corporate sponsors, the Royal Insurance 
Company, which will give the RSC 2.1 million ($3.4 million) over the next three 
years -- a record for a performing arts company in Britain, where corporate 
support for the arts has played a lesser role than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Rushton, chief executive for Royal Insurance, wants the government to pay 
off the deficits of all Britain's major arts companies -- which he estimates 
would cost 13.4 million ($22.2 million). "This would allow them to carry on 
with their proper artistic function," he added. 
</P>
<P>
As for Royal Insurance's "white knight" sponsorship of RSC -- which follows a 
previous three-year commitment of 1.4 million ($2.3 million) -- Rushton 
insists: "It has never been the intention of Royal Insurance to provide the 
central core funding for the arts. That is for government." DAVID GRITTEN

The Lithuanian government, retreating from its three-month-old declaration of 
independence, recommended on Saturday that the Baltic republic's Parliament 
suspend the declaration in order to begin negotiations with the central 
government on Lithuania's secession from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Cabinet proposed that the Supreme Council, the republic's 
Parliament, declare a "temporary moratorium" on the independence act to meet 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's demand that the unilateral Lithuanian 
declaration be suspended before negotiations begin. 
</P>
<P>
"The government suggests to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania 
that it debate the possibility of declaring a temporary moratorium on the 
(independence) act for the period of negotiations with the Soviet Union," a 
government statement issued in Vilnius said. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration of independence, adopted March 11, would remain valid, 
government officials said, but its implementation would be suspended while 
negotiations were under way. Lithuania remains determined to become 
independent, they said, but wants to negotiate its future relationship with 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal must be approved by the Lithuanian Parliament, many of whose 
members are outspoken advocates of immediate and full independence for their 
nation, and then accepted by the central government. 
</P>
<P>
But the shift was significant enough for the official Soviet news agency Tass 
to say on Saturday that it "could mark the beginning of the solution of all the 
'Lithuanian problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Lithuania said it would freeze only the implementation of the 
hundred-plus laws and resolutions adopted after the independence declaration, 
but it refused to suspend or rescind the declaration itself, as Moscow has 
demanded as a condition for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Such action, Lithuanian leaders argued, would amount to accepting voluntarily 
Lithuania's status as a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. The small 
nation, which was independent for 18 years between World War I and World War 
II, was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 in a pact made by 
the Kremlin with Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has said that Lithuania does have the moral right of 
self-determination and a constitutional right to secede from the Soviet Union, 
but he has insisted that the terms for its withdrawal must be negotiated within 
the framework of the Soviet constitution and legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In talks last week with the presidents of the three Baltic republics, including 
Lithuania's Vytautas Landsbergis, the Soviet leader significantly relaxed those 
conditions, clearing the way for a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"If Lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of independence, we 
may start to talk," Gorbachev said on Tuesday. "That means suspending its 
implementation at least for the duration of the talks." 
</P>
<P>
That was the intent of the Lithuanian Cabinet, which met in Vilnius under 
Premier Kazimiera Prunskiene, who has led the search for a compromise. "Our act 
of independence would remain valid," Gentaras Jatkonis, a government spokesman 
said, "but we are postponing the realization of it." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Cabinet was at pains nonetheless to portray the proposed 
suspension as no retreat from the principles contained in the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"A moratorium does not mean that the act is abolished," the government 
statement said. "A moratorium only means that for the duration of the 
negotiations the use of the rights stemming from the independence act is 
postponed, and the status of Lithuania as an independent state does not change. 
Breaking off the negotiations automatically brings an end to the moratorium." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Cabinet's proposal, Lithuania would suspend the declaration 
immediately, but it would implement the decision and begin the talks, which 
have been sought by both sides, only when Moscow has fully lifted its economic 
blockade. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, despite these precautions, could encounter strong opposition on 
Tuesday in the Lithuanian Parliament, which is dominated by members of Sajudis, 
the pro-independence movement led by Landsbergis. The Cabinet, a coalition led 
by the highly respected Prunskiene that includes Communists as well as Sajudis 
members, is regarded as more moderate and less confrontational than the 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was supported by the Lithuanian Communist Party, which broke with 
Moscow on the issue of Lithuanian independence and remains a political force in 
the republic. 
</P>
<P>
While declaring the independence declaration to be "irreversible," the party 
said that there is a need for a transition period to consolidate real statehood 
for Lithuania, and it urged the republic's leadership to do its "utmost" to 
start negotiations with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's offer of compromise, including a new and looser status for the 
Baltic republics within the Soviet Union, was welcomed on Saturday as "quite a 
positive move" and "very serious" by Dainis Ivans, chairman of the Latvian 
Popular Front, which seeks independence for Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal of the president expands the vistas for political movement and 
produces various possibilities in solving our problem," Ivans said in a 
television interview broadcast on the Soviet nightly news program Vremya. "This 
is a move forward, and it cannot remain unanswered." 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic Assembly, which groups the popular fronts of Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania, met on Saturday at Jurmala, a Latvian beachfront resort, to 
coordinate strategies in their campaigns to reestablish the independence of 
their nations. 
</P>
<P>
In a message to the parliaments of the three republics, the assembly warned 
that "nobody has a right to demand either the abrogation or halting the acts on 
independence. A retreat will harm the democratic movement," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis, addressing the meeting, called for a united approach to Moscow. 
"We should tightly clasp hands so that the hold should not be broken and that 
the Baltic link remains intact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic Council, which is made up of top government officials from the three 
republics, is expected to meet later this week to discuss Gorbachev's proposals 
following debates in each of the parliaments. 
</P>
<P>
Going well beyond an offer to negotiate terms for their secession, Gorbachev 
outlined to the Baltic leaders his vision of a commonwealth of sovereign states 
bound together by varying political, economic, cultural and social ties, and he 
urged the Baltic nations to participate in the talks in which this new union is 
forged and to consider joining it. 
</P>
<P>
As Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov promised Prunskiene last week, the central 
government's punishing economic blockade of Lithuania is being eased. The flow 
of natural gas to Lithuania was increased sufficiently on Saturday to permit 
the reopening of a key fertilizer plant this week, officials in Vilnius said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to get 3.5 million cubic meters of gas daily, allowing it 
to return to operation by the end of the week.

LAWMAKERS FIND FREEBIES A LESS POPULAR WAY TO GO 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.), a member of a key defense appropriations 
subcommittee, spent six days in Los Angeles last year at the expense of half a 
dozen defense companies and returned home with $10,000 in appearance fees. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed at the Century Plaza, dined at fine restaurants and generally had a 
very good time. "I love to go to Los Angeles," said Wilson, smiling broadly as 
he recalled his trip. "You all really got it figured out pretty well out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's visit was what one House aide characterizes as "your standard 
honoraria trip" -- a phenomenon of congressional life that provides fees and 
free travel to influential lawmakers who are willing to visit the companies 
whose business depends on decisions by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For years, such trips hosted by Southern California's defense industry have 
been one of the most popular ways for members of Congress with responsibilities 
over defense to earn extra income. Contractors and members of Congress have 
long defended this practice as a legitimate outgrowth of the legislative 
process. 
</P>
<P>
But in an era when politicians are increasingly being criticized by their 
political opponents for accepting money from special interests, it appears that 
these trips could be harder to come by for Wilson and other lawmakers. In the 
last year, several defense contractors, led by Lockheed, General Dynamics and 
McDonnell Douglas, have banned the practice on the ground that it opens them 
and the congressmen involved up to unnecessary criticism. 
</P>
<P>
At Lockheed, Steve Caudet, vice president for public affairs, said it was ended 
because it began to be viewed as a bad system. "We ought to figure out a better 
way for members of Congress to be paid," Caudet said. "There is a feeling on 
the part of the public that honoraria is not the way to do the public's 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, congressional trips to Southern California defense plants have 
begun with an invitation from a single company. Other contractors then are 
asked to share the air fare from Washington, as well as the costs of hotel, 
meals, ground transportation and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Each day during his stay, the visiting lawmaker goes to a different plant and 
listens to briefings from corporate executives. The lawmaker is also expected 
to make a brief speech to the company's employees in order to qualify for an 
honorarium of up to $2,000 from each firm. 
</P>
<P>
In their heyday, these trips often combined business with pleasure. A benchmark 
for leisure apparently was set in 1988 when several contractors paid for Rep. 
Joseph M. McDade (R-Pa.), ranking Republican on the House Appropriations 
Committee's defense subcommittee, to participate in two golf tournaments in 
Southern California. The 12-day visit also earned McDade $5,000 in appearance 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Although contractors and members of Congress have always been sensitive to 
criticism of these trips, there was little effort to curb the practice until 
early last year whenthe House voted to severely restrict honorariums, beginning 
next January. Some contractors felt honorarium trips had received "too much bad 
press," as one official put it. 
</P>
<P>
Just a year earlier, veteran Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. (R-Conn.) was defeated 
by an opponent who made an issue of appearance fees and trips he had accepted. 
</P>
<P>
William W. Maurer, legislative affairs director of General Dynamics, said his 
company decided to end the free trips after the conduct of the late Rep. Bill 
Chappell Jr. (D-Fla.), chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee, 
became a subject of inquiry in the defense procurement scandal known as Ill 
Wind, which has led to the conviction of more than 30 individuals and four 
companies. Chappell, who had received appearance fees from defense contractors, 
was not charged with illegal acts. 
</P>
<P>
However, "Our chairman said: 'I just don't want to take any chances,' " Maurer 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional reaction to the ending of free trips by some companies was 
divided. Some members of Congress were "very angry," according to Maurer. But 
other industry officials said an increasing number of the most influential 
members of the defense-related committees had already begun to decline their 
invitations. 
</P>
<P>
"An awful lot of members just quit asking," said Gaudet. "Everything kind of 
converged at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who stopped asking was Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.), chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on strategic forces and nuclear 
deterrence. Exon, who took his last free trip to Los Angeles at the expense of 
Northrop, Rockwell and Marquardt in late 1988, abruptly stopped accepting the 
appearance fees and free trips early last year while Congress was debating a 
proposed ban on honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the House, the Senate eventually rejected the ban and senators will 
continue to be permitted to receive up to $23,568 in honorariums next year. In 
the House, although members will be barred from keeping any honorarium income, 
they will be allowed to donate the fees to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bowen, press secretary to Exon, said that the Nebraska senator -- one of 
at least 33 senators who have voluntarily forsworn honorariums in recent years 
-- was convinced by last year's Senate debate that the honorariums were no 
longer viewed by the voting public as acceptable. "The senator decided that if 
there is a question in anybody's mind, he would not take in any more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even some members of Congress who continue to travel the defense contractors' 
circuit in Los Angeles are now critical of the trips. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.), who took two all-expenses-paid trips to Southern 
California last year that netted him $14,000 in fees, said he feels 
"uncomfortable" taking money from these companies because it could create an 
appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that this is a new opinion for him. "Did I always feel 
uncomfortable about the system? The answer is no," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.), another frequent visitor to the defense 
plants in the Los Angeles area, said he still does it primarily for the money. 
Without the honorariums, he said, he would have been unable to put his two 
children through college. 
</P>
<P>
"The honoraria trail is a piece of congressional life," AuCoin said. 
</P>
<P>
As AuCoin explains it, a tour of Southern California defense plants in January 
or February, when Congress is seldom in session, is one of the fastest and 
easiest ways for a member of Congress to collect the maximum in fees before the 
press of congressional business increases later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
AuCoin also noted that he has voted against some of the weapons produced by 
contractors who paid for his travel. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the bad publicity generated by the honorarium system, some members 
of Congress are not shy about collecting these fees. Defense contractors still 
receive more requests than they can satisfy from members wishing to visit their 
Southern California plants, according to industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics' Maurer said his firm has even received requests for 
invitations from members of committees that have nothing to do with defense, 
such the House or Senate agriculture committees. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert W. Davis (R-Mich.), who has had to defend his honorariums against 
campaign attacks in recent reelection battles, makes no apologies about his 
trips to Los Angeles. He said he goes on these trips for the fees and the 
opportunity to persuade the big defense firms to use subcontractors from his 
home district. 
</P>
<P>
"We say to the big contractors: 'We'd like an opportunity to bid on some of 
your work,' " Davis explained. 
</P>
<P>
Some contractors who have abandoned the practice say they fear that it will now 
be more difficult for them to persuade Congress to continue funding their 
programs without the opportunity to corral key members of defense-related 
committees for an entire day of briefings. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to find other ways to inform members," Gaudet said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, other contractors whose programs are in particular jeopardy by 
congressional budget cutting continue to provide free trips. Indeed, one of the 
most popular congressional trips last year was not to the Los Angeles area, but 
instead to the Bell Helicopter plant in Ft. Worth, Tex., where the V-22 Osprey 
is being developed. Bell currently is battling the Pentagon's decision not to 
buy the V-22. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Northrop, whose multibillion-dollar B-2 bomber project is 
sorely threatened by congressional budget cutting, continues to be a leader in 
providing congressional trips to Los Angeles. Many members still visit 
Northrop's B-2 shop for briefings. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's Washington spokesman, Loy Miller, said his company will continue to 
pay honorariums to House members next year, even though the lawmakers will be 
required to funnel the money to charity. "I don't think we'll go out of the 
honoraria business," he said.

THE MOVIES OF SUMMER -- HYPE HAS BECOME AN EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hold on to your yellow Fedora, fasten your two-way wrist radio, because those 
hungry monsters known as summer blockbusters have once again been unleashed. 
We're not talking about mere movies. In what promises to be one of the biggest 
collections of cinematic mega-hits ever released, this is the season of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the world's film and pop culture capital, there is nowhere to 
hide. From now until Labor Day, expect an especially numbing blitz of 
promotions, billboards, TV spots, merchandising and any other method the 
studios can think of to make their movie seem as crucially important as good 
hygiene or a balanced diet. 
</P>
<P>
None has been more ballyhooed than "Dick Tracy," Walt Disney's film version of 
the 59-year-old comic strip, starring Warren Beatty as the square-jawed cop and 
Madonna as the tempting Breathless Mahoney. The $30-million movie, which is 
estimated to have an ad budget of equal size, hopes to be in 1990 what the 
hugely successful "Batman" was last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is like a perfectly choreographed fashion wave," said Brian 
Stonehill, an English professor who teaches a course in visual literacy at 
Pomona College in Claremont. "Hollywood tunes the culture to a certain pitch. 
At the moment the film is released, everything vibrates sympathetically." 
</P>
<P>
From trendy Westwood to working-class West Covina, that meant thousands of 
enthused fans this weekend stood for hours in block-long lines, snatched up 
pricey souvenirs and launched theword-of-mouth network that ultimately will 
determine how long "Dick Tracy" remains a part of the popular mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, it meant crowds of devotees paying from $12 to $20 each for 
an "I Was There First" T-shirt that doubled as an admission ticket to the 
midnight premiere. Friday and Saturday evening shows were jammed across much of 
Southern California, with one large downtown Los Angeles law firm renting an 
entire theater at Laemmle's Grande for its staff. 
</P>
<P>
At knickknack stores, such as Aahs! in Westwood, it meant moving aside the 
memorabilia of such marketing sensations as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and 
The Simpsons to make room for Dick Tracy pendants ($4.95), mugs ($7.50), dolls 
($16) and lunch pails ($19.95). 
</P>
<P>
On the streets of Hollywood, it meant hearing the spiels of bootlegging 
hucksters -- "Dick Tracy, right here, man! Check it out! Listen up!" -- as they 
tried to unload cut-rate buttons, stickers, comic books and caps. 
</P>
<P>
In supermarkets, it meant watching for the 40 million boxes of Quaker Oats 
products that will be promoting the film. McDonald's is already offering the 
Dick Tracy Crimestoppers Game, a lottery-style contest that allows customers to 
solve crimes, catch bad guys and win up to $1 million. And, for the true fan, 
there's a 20-minute live musical stage show featuring the hawk-beaked gumshoe 
at Disneyland's hip teen disco, Videopolis. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a picture that has a dimension about it . . . that raises it above 
being just a new movie and makes it part of the contemporary culture," said 
Martin A. Grove, film analyst for the Hollywood Reporter. "Batman carried that 
to the ultimate. Now, Disney, with Dick Tracy, is updating it." 
</P>
<P>
If you don't believe the hype, just check out Dave Richards, a homeless man 
with a frizzy beard and shoulder-length hair who spends most nights curled up 
in a West Hollywood alleyway drinking himself to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, 38, says he is a sucker for a premiere. So he gave up the bottle for 
a few days and spent his time panhandling until he collected $15 to buy the 
T-shirt that was his ticket to Thursday's debut screening. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, dude, if it weren't for this, I'd probably be passed out on Hollywood 
Boulevard," said Richards, waiting in a two-block-long line outside the Pacific 
Theater. "But I wanted to be part of the energy here tonight. This is what 
movies are supposed to be all about . . . the way Hollywood used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics, however, don't think this is what the movies should be about. The 
blockbuster mentality, they contend, discourages thoughtful, complex films in 
favor of infantile spectacles that appeal to the lowest common denominator. 
</P>
<P>
"These events have taken on inordinate significance," said Mark Crispin Miller, 
head of media studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "I was sick of 
Dick Tracy three weeks ago and it hadn't even started yet." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, outside Pacific's Crest Theater in Westwood, where the 8 p.m. and 10:40 
p.m. shows had been sold out since midday, Lance Falk, a 29-year-old North 
Hollywood cartoonist, reacted in much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"This hype has the opposite effect on me," he said, hurrying off to another 
film. "It just makes me think of a bunch of accountants scribbling away -- 
soulless automatons scheming to get my money." 
</P>
<P>
But for every cynic, there's always someone else all too eager to catch the 
latest wave. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Tracy -- he's, like, too cool," said Mattie Cline, a 30-year-old airline 
ticket agent from Torrance who was debating whether to fork out the $20 for a 
Tracy lunch box. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not hyped, I'm psyched," said Bart Morningstar, 26, an early arrival for 
the premiere in Hollywood. "Everyone on this line is lit up. I bet if you 
walked up to people here and got real close, you'd feel the heat." 
</P>
<P>
Carefully manufactured events have always been a part of the Hollywood 
experience. To celebrate the opening of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1927, Mary 
Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks took the novel step of sticking their palms in 
wet concrete outside. 
</P>
<P>
In 1937, a nationwide talent search for an unknown actress to play Scarlett 
O'Hara kept "Gone With the Wind" on the front pages for months. To promote the 
1946 film, "The Egg and I," legendary press agent Jim Moran spent 19 days 
perched on an ostrich egg. And in 1974, there was a special drive-in premiere 
of Mel Brooks' Western spoof, "Blazing Saddles," just for moviegoers on 
horseback. 
</P>
<P>
But something happened in the summer of 1975, when Universal Pictures turned a 
film about a blood thirsty shark into a national sensation. "Jaws," which at 
the time was the biggest U.S. box office hit ever, was one of the first movies 
to successfully infiltrate the marketplace with T-shirts, belt buckles, 
swimsuits, sharks' teeth jewelry and ice cream flavors such as jawcolate and 
finilla. 
</P>
<P>
"Sharkmania seems to know no bounds," gushed a Universal publicist at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer's release of "Batman" catapulted the concept of the summer 
blockbuster into another stratosphere. Despite mixed reviews, the caped 
crusader brought in more than $500 million through U.S. box office receipts, 
foreign distribution and a thriving merchandise machine that has yet to 
subside. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it's difficult to know if "Dick Tracy" will be able to rival that. Box 
office returns for the first weekend won't be out until Monday. Merchants say 
it is probably too early to tell if such items as Tracy shower curtains, 
walkie-talkies, trench coats, backpacks, drapes, lingerie and video games will 
end up as big sellers. 
</P>
<P>
In coming weeks, other promotions will try to capture the same market for such 
films as "Die Hard 2," "Days of Thunder" and "RoboCop 2." 
</P>
<P>
"If the movie's no good, you can get by," said Karl Kelley, 40, who was out on 
Hollywood Boulevard over the weekend hawking Tracy T-shirts and buttons. "But 
if they like the movie, you can sell stale bread and they'll buy it." 
</P>
<P>
At the head of the line to get into Thursday's premiere in Hollywood, Patricia 
O'Brien explained that, in the end, it wouldn't really matter. The 21-year-old 
aspiring screenwriter from San Pedro just wanted to say she had been there. 
</P>
<P>
"If the movie is incredible, then we'll say we came for the movie," she said. 
"If the movie bombs, then we'll say we came for the happening. Either way, it's 
a party."

MINORITY GAINS LIMITED IN L.A. BUSING PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
INTEGRATION: ACHIEVEMENT SUFFERS IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STUDENTS. GAP 'WIDE AND 
PERSISTENT,' OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 20 years after the Los Angeles Unified School District began its 
original busing program to integrate schools, the minority pupils in that 
program are doing little or no better than the students they leave behind in 
segregated schools, and much worse than their white classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years of district evaluations reveal that children bused under the 
voluntary program have lower reading and math scores than the neighborhood 
students sitting beside them. They go on to college at lower rates. Teachers 
expect less from them. And they suffer low self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
District officials are aware of the disparity, but little has been done to 
improve the academic performance of the 13,000 minority students bused under 
the plan, called Permits With Transportation (PWT) -- one of several busing 
programs the district maintains. 
</P>

PWT "was never meant to be an academic improvement program," contends school 
Supt. Leonard Britton. "We said we would provide an integrated experience for 
the children, not necessarily an improved education. But in the back of some 
people's minds was the thought that great things would happen if they put their 
children on the bus." 
</P>
<P>
Admits school board President Jackie Goldberg: "We have not shown great 
leadership. We have to be able to say something more than, 'Oh God, the scores 
are low again,' which has traditionally been our response." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, thousands of minority parents who sought the promise of a 
better education signed up for the program, which allowed their children to 
attend schools made up predominantly of other races or ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Patsy Boston, like many parents, expected great things when she signed her 
daughter up to travel from South-Central Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley 
seven years ago. "I wanted her to experience different cultures and other 
environments . . . but mostly, I wanted her to get a better education, and I 
believed the Valley schools were better." 
</P>
<P>
Now, she says, after watching her daughter's grades drop and her attitude turn 
sour, she plans to pull the 13-year-old out of the program and return her to 
their neighborhood high school next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I put her through all this?" she said. "To go someplace where she's 
not wanted and they don't care whether she succeeds or fails?" 
</P>
<P>
Since the district began evaluating the program in 1981, the achievement gap 
between PWT students and their suburban counterparts has remained "wide and 
persistent," according to Winston Doby, UCLA's vice chancellor, who reviews the 
program for the district each year. 
</P>
<P>
While students bused to magnet schools under the district's other voluntary 
busing program perform above the district average, PWT students "appear to 
complete first grade achieving below districtwide norms and never manage to 
catch up," Doby's report two years ago warned. "The district must seriously 
reconsider its approach to educating these students." 
</P>
<P>
But the PWT program has been a linchpin in the system's court-approved 
voluntary desegregation plan since mandatory busing was stopped in 1981, and 
any major changes might mean the district would have to go back to court. 
</P>
<P>
This "is the only program that desegregates white schools," explained attorney 
Peter James, who heads the district's desegregation legal team. Other district 
busing programs relieve overcrowding or serve integrated schools. 
</P>
<P>
PWT "was intended to reduce segregation within the district, and it's working 
as well as anything we've got," he said. "The achievement results have not been 
what we've hoped, but it is desegregating." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Doby explained in a report on PWT several years ago: "The treatment is 
successful, but the patients are still dying." 
</P>
<P>
Britton acknowledges that while the students are "not doing any worse than they 
would have in their home schools, they're not doing any better" than if they'd 
skipped the long bus rides and stayed in their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The district has poured millions of dollars into those low-achieving, 
inner-city schools -- lowering class sizes, adding preschool programs that give 
youngsters a better academic foundation and teaching parents how to help their 
children succeed in school. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, most of the West Side and San Fernando Valley schools that receive 
PWT students get only an additional $50 per year per bused student -- an amount 
unchanged since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do much at a (receiving) school for PWT students," concedes Britton. 
"We don't provide much of anything. So much depends on the attitudes and the 
individuals at those schools." 
</P>
<P>
Although the educational experts who have reviewed the PWT program have 
recommended several specific support services -- such as weekend and evening 
tutorials, teacher training, peer counseling and in-class tutoring -- receiver 
schools spend about 90% of their integration funds to hire classroom aides. 
</P>
<P>
And while the district monitors those schools to make sure each has a plan to 
educate the students, no one evaluates a school's success or failure to 
adequately perform the task. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said that must change. The board plans to begin hearings on its 
integration programs this summer, and Goldberg said schools should be given 
guidance and adequate support services, then held accountable for producing 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, there has been little pressure on the board or district officials to 
improve the academic performance of PWT students. 
</P>
<P>
Because the board did not conduct public hearings on the program until this 
year, parents have not realized that the academic failings were so serious or 
widespread. And it has been hard for district officials "to single this out in 
a district that's facing so many other problems," Britton said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the problems of the PWT students seem to pale beside those of the 
25,000 minority children -- many newcomers to the country who speak little or 
no English -- who are involuntarily bused to relieve overcrowding in their 
neighborhood schools, and score lowest of all the district's pupils. 
</P>
<P>
They disappear in the glow over the success of the 98-school magnet program, 
which provides enriched, specialized curriculum to about 28,000 students, who 
consistently score above district and national norms on achievement tests. 
</P>
<P>
"PWT has been ignored," contends board member Rita Walters, who represents the 
South-Central Los Angeles area that provides many of the program's students. "I 
think it's been viewed as something that has to be tolerated, but the things 
that need to be done to make it a successful program as far as achievement goes 
have never occurred." 
</P>
<P>
The program was started in the mid-1960s by a handful of black parents who got 
permission to transfer their children from their neighborhood elementary 
schools to virtually all-white West Side schools. The parents provided their 
own transportation until 1968, when the district agreed to bus the 550 
participating students. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak in 1984, about 23,000 PWT students were bused each day. The program 
pairs minority schools with integrated receiving schools so that groups of 
neighborhood children travel together to their new schools. 
</P>
<P>
The program initially appealed to middle-class black families, eager to expand 
their children's horizons beyond their mostly black neighborhoods. But as the 
black population in the district dwindled and magnet schools siphoned off many 
potential students, the program has shrunk and become more popular among Latino 
and lower-income black families. Few white students ever have participated. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents say they selected PWT because they believed schools on the West 
Side and in the Valley were safer and better, with more experienced teachers, 
broader course offerings, more rigorous college preparation programs and fewer 
gang and crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, a lot of us are wondering whether it's worth it," said Gloria Jenkins, a 
Windsor Hills mother whose twin sons were bused to a West Side elementary and 
junior high until one was kicked out for disciplinary problems this spring. He 
now attends an all-black private school, where he is thriving socially and 
academically -- scoring several points higher than before on standardized 
tests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents tell stories of children worn out by long bus rides, frustrated by the 
sense of not belonging in their adopted schools and embittered by what they 
feel is racist treatment in the receiving schools and communities. 
</P>
<P>
"My children never heard (racial slurs) until they went to the West Side," 
Jenkins said. "As a parent, you feel that you constantly have to be on guard to 
protect them . . . and make sure they get educated like everyone else, and 
that's very hard to do when you're 40 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with students and teachers and reviews of data in the district's 
evaluations of its integration programs bear some of that out. 
</P>
<P>
PWT students wind up in remedial classes more often than resident students and 
are less likely to take advanced courses or participate in extracurricular and 
leadership activities. 
</P>
<P>
White students at some schools told district interviewers that although their 
black and Latino classmates "are fine as individuals," the minority students 
were frightening and "intimidating" when they congregated in groups. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers had lower expectations for their black and Latino pupils and believed 
that white and Asian students from the neighborhood were favored because they 
dominate the gifted classes and their parents are more involved in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say the teachers set out to treat (PWT students) differently, but 
it's a tough situation on both sides," explained Brenda Creed, dean for 
traveling students at Taft High School, the district's largest receiver school, 
with almost one third of its 2,800 students on the PWT program. 
</P>
<P>
Many suburban teachers have been at their schools for 10 years or more and 
remember a time when schools such as Taft were almost all white and 
upper-middle class, Creed said. It has been difficult for some to adjust to the 
changing demographics and needs of their new student population. 
</P>
<P>
PWT students are handicapped by the physical rigors of the long bus rides they 
must endure and are sometimes late for class or not as well prepared as 
neighborhood students, Creed said. "Some teachers are quick to bounce (PWT 
students) out of class" when there's a problem. "Some are not real sympathetic 
to all these kids have to go through." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the busing program's academic failings, there are some success 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
There are Valley high school valedictorians who are bused from inner-city 
neighborhoods. There are friendships between white and minority students that 
transcend the differences and enlarge the vistas of both. 
</P>
<P>
"It's given my son an opportunity to learn some things I could never teach 
him," said Jay Berger, a white parent whose son attends a Canoga Park 
elementary school with many bused-in students. "He's more aware and connected 
to the world than a kid who grows up isolated in this artificial white, 
middle-class community." 
</P>
<P>
And parents such as Jenkins and Boston believe that their children will be 
better equipped for success because of their PWT experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sorry I sent them," Jenkins says of her two sons. "They experienced 
things they never would have experienced in their neighborhood schools. They 
went to private parties, bar mitzvahs . . . things that exposed them to 
different ways of life. They went scuba diving, and on a trip to Catalina 
Island for the weekend. I think they'll value that all their lives." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the poor academic performance of PWT students are complicated, 
district officials and educational experts say. But the barriers posed by the 
integration process -- the long bus rides and lack of opportunity for parental 
involvement -- contribute mightily. 
</P>
<P>
Some schools, such as Taft, work hard to maximize the involvement of PWT 
parents, holding night meetings in the neighborhoods their children are bused 
from and calling parents immediately when traveling students miss school or 
have problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the distance between the school and the community makes it difficult for 
all but the most determined parents to participate, particularly for low-income 
parents, who may not have the transportation, child care or free time. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a big difference when you can just walk down the street to your 
child's school to talk with a teacher and visit a classroom, rather than having 
to take a day to drive" across town, said Pam Bruns, a Pacific Palisades parent 
who has been active in support of busing programs that have paired her 
neighborhood schools with minority schools. 
</P>
<P>
Studies nationwide have identified parental involvement as a key element in 
raising student achievement, but the Los Angeles district has done little to 
make it easier for parents of traveling students to have a voice in their 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Schools provide buses to get parents to campus on special occasions, such as 
Back to School night, but there is little opportunity for regular interaction 
between the inner-city parents and their children's suburban schools. 
</P>
<P>
But the root of the achievement disparity between bused children and their 
neighborhood classmates undoubtably lies in the economic differences between 
the groups, experts and district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
National studies have consistently demonstrated a correlation between 
socioeconomic status and school achievement, and systematic -- and often 
expensive -- intervention usually is needed to break the cycle of low 
achievement among low-income students. 
</P>
<P>
Low-income students generally have parents who are not well-educated and cannot 
provide the kinds of support or resources, such as reference material or help 
with homework, that middle-income families provide their children. 
</P>
<P>
The children's language skills often lag far behind their middle-class 
counterparts, because a foreign language or non-standard English is spoken in 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
And their families are likely to be larger and crowded into small homes or 
apartments. Basic needs, such as a quiet place and time to do homework, often 
are lacking for poor students. 
</P>
<P>
But programs to overcome those problems would require lots of money, and that 
is in short supply in a district struggling to cut educational programs to 
eliminate an expected $220-million shortfall this year. 
</P>
<P>
The board is discussing a plan to divert about $1.5 million of the more than 
$93 million the district spends busing students to fund support services such 
as supplemental language instruction and after-school study halls at receiving 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
But even that will be only a drop in the bucket, since more than 60,000 
students are being bused on the district's various integration programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TEST SCORES FOR BUSED STUDENTS 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District uses the national, standardized 
Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) to measure student achievement. 
Scores are expressed in relation to the performance of all students tested 
nationwide. For example, a student ranking in the 65th percentile has scored at 
or above the level of 65% of the students taking the test nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The chart lists the 1988-89 percentile rankings on the CTBS reading, language 
and mathematics tests of students bused to integrated schools under the PWT 
program, neighborhood students attending schools that receive PWT students, 
students attending predominantly minority schools, and all students in the 
district.

LEBANON REJECTS VATICAN PROPOSAL TO END DEADLOCK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Lebanese government has rejected a Vatican proposal aimed at breaking the 
deadlock in implementing a peace plan to end the 15-year-old civil war, 
newspapers said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican had suggested amending the Arab League peace plan to make it more 
acceptable to rebel Christian Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, who has refused to 
recognize President Elias Hrawi's authority, the newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
But Beirut's independent An Nahar daily said the Vatican proposal was rejected 
by Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic, and by Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni 
Muslim, and Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, police said Aoun's mainly Christian troops and the rival 
Lebanese Forces militia led by Christian warlord Samir Geagea skirmished during 
the night with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported, and the fighting died down at dawn, police said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest violation of an increasingly fragile month-old cease-fire 
mediated by the Vatican to halt the fighting between Aoun and Geagea, who are 
locked in a power struggle for control of the Christian enclave north of 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
By police count, 1,036 people have been killed and 2,774 wounded since the 
Aoun-Geagea fighting erupted in January. Their battles have forced 40% of the 
enclave's 1 million people to flee to safer areas or leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun released 37 Lebanese Forces militiamen who were taken prisoner during the 
power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the militia members, who were held in underground jails, were 
handed over Saturday to officials of the International Committee of the Red 
Cross in the town of Kfarchima southeast of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Aoun called on Geagea to follow suit and release some kidnaped 
army troops. 
</P>
<P>
An Nahar and the leftist Beirut daily, As Safir, said the Vatican initiative 
was relayed to Hrawi's government in Muslim West Beirut by Papal Nuncio Pablo 
Puente earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The reports said the Vatican had proposed amending the Arab League peace plan 
in return for Aoun's recognizing the Hrawi government's authority. 
</P>
<P>
The peace plan was endorsed last October by Lebanon's Parliament at the Saudi 
Arabian resort of Taif. It calls for the equal distribution of power between 
the traditionally dominant Christians and the majority Muslims.

VOLATILE KOSOVO LOOKS TO ALBANIA; 
</P>
<P>
YUGOSLAVIA: PROMISE OF DEMOCRACY ACROSS THE BORDER COULD BE A STRONGER LURE 
THAN ETHNIC TIES.

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For decades the Serbs of Yugoslavia have warily eyed cloistered Albania, 
accusing their Stalinist neighbor of sending spies and infiltrators to incite 
separatism among ethnic Albanians in the border province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Albania may be unleashing a more powerful force that could attract the 
support of Kosovo Albanians: democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Albania's tentative steps toward reform have sparked new hope in the West that 
the last hard-line holdout of Eastern Europe may be softening. But for 
Yugoslavia, the prospect of a more liberal Albania strikes another match near 
the ethnic tinderbox of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Communist Party leader, Slobodan Milosevic, rose to power by 
stirring fear among fellow Serbs that Albanians were plotting to join Kosovo to 
a greater Albania. More than 1.7 million ethnic Albanians live in Kosovo, and 
they far outnumber the 200,000 Serbs in the province, the poorest part of 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Albanians used to dismiss the accusations of separatism as ludicrous, 
arguing that many of them are in Yugoslavia because their parents sought to 
escape repressive rule at home. 
</P>
<P>
But if Albania follows through on its promises of freer travel, respect for 
human rights and new ties with Western governments, Milosevic's purported fears 
of Albanian unity could become a prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
"If Albania advances and we stay in the same place, if there continues to be no 
democracy in Kosovo, the chances are that people will choose to go elsewhere," 
said Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the Democratic Alliance, the opposition party 
widely supported by Kosovo Albanians. "The Serbian government refuses to see 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has been the scene of recurring violence since March, 1989, when Serbia 
stripped it of the autonomy provided by the 1974 constitution. Milosevic 
engineered the change to assure fellow Serbs that the historic province would 
never be lost to Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Kosovo was the site of a heroic battle fought by Serbian warriors in 1389. 
Serbia lost but slowed the Ottoman Turks' advance into Europe. To Serbs, Kosovo 
symbolizes the greatness of the medieval kingdom they were never able to 
restore after 500 years of Turkish occupation. 
</P>
<P>
By flexing Serbia's muscle in Kosovo, Milosevic elevated Serbian national pride 
and won the loyalty of his fellow Serbs, who account for 9 million of 
Yugoslavia's 23 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The price has been continual ethnic confrontation and repeated states of 
emergency and martial law. 
</P>
<P>
With the new allure of a more acceptable Albanian homeland, some Kosovo leaders 
and Western political attaches worry that continued repression of the majority 
Albanians could drive them toward a secession movement never seriously 
entertained before. 
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Albanians are agitating for republic status within Yugoslavia, arguing 
that the nation of six republics and two provinces has been defined by ethnic 
differences since its formation in 1918. Albanians are the third-largest 
Yugoslav ethnic group after Serbs and Croats, and they believe they should not 
be deprived of the status afforded smaller national minorities in Slovenia, 
Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
Serbia, Rugova said, has relegated Kosovo to colonial status and misused 
federal funds earmarked for provincial improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Rugova lives on the seventh floor of a 12-story building in which the elevators 
have been broken for years, the entryway reeks of urine and broken lighting has 
resulted in total darkness in the stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
Prefabricated concrete tenements are scattered randomly among this provincial 
capital's ramshackle cottages, strung together by lines of faded laundry, the 
signal flags of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The streets teem with idle youths, the result of a burgeoning birthrate twice 
as high as the rest of Yugoslavia, compounded by unemployment that Serbian 
officials peg at 36% but that Albanians contend is much higher. Squads of 
Serbian police patrol the sidewalks day and night, moving loiterers along to 
prevent spontaneous demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Rugova, a respected writer and intellectual, said the Serbian police are trying 
to bait Albanians into confrontation in order to postpone 
</P>
<P>
multi-party elections. 
</P>
<P>
Serbia is the only Yugoslav republic that has not had or scheduled free 
elections this year. By all accounts, Serbia would lose control of Kosovo to 
the Albanian majority in a fair and open ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Western pressure has been applied on the capital of Belgrade to lift the state 
of siege in Kosovo and to end the one-party rule that persists in Serbia and on 
the national level. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Markovic promised nationwide elections this year, 
and this will force Serbia to hold a multi-party republic ballot before the 
national election. This has turned the Kosovo confrontation into a volatile 
waiting game, with both sides holding back from setting off the looming clash. 
</P>
<P>
An uneasy calm has been maintained for the past three months amid alleged 
atrocities that testify to the backwardness and brutality of the impoverished 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Stambuk, a leader of Milosevic's Serbian Socialist Alliance, said 
Albanians are trying to drive the remaining Serbs out of Kosovo by means of 
intimidation ranging from rape to house-burning. 
</P>
<P>
Jashar Kabashi, an Albanian professor of English at Kosovo University, accused 
the Serbian police of beating Albanian protesters, jailing activists without 
charge and segregating schools in order to arrange "accidents" that affect only 
Albanian children, including a mysterious poisoning incident in March. 
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, officials see the Kosovo strife as the result of foreign 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
Stambuk said the reduction of Kosovo's status was necessary to stop 
infiltration of Albanian government agents sent to incite a secessionist drive. 
</P>
<P>
Serbia reacted with indignation when two American politicians, one of them Rep. 
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), told a cheering crowd of 10,000 Albanians in Pristina 
in late May that the U.S. Congress is behind them. An official protest was made 
to the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, and the Serbian press accused the United 
States of meddling. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Serbia has lately 
whipped up an anti-American campaign in an attempt to create a foreign 
scapegoat for domestic failures. They cited the attempt to assert Serbian will 
over Kosovo, and said it will collapse with free elections. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of elections, but constitutional reforms are needed first," 
Stambuk said. 
</P>
<P>
Those changes, which would subjugate Kosovo to Serbian rule, are embodied in a 
draft constitution the Serbian leadership plans to present within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the restrictions invoked last year, Kosovo no longer has veto power over 
constitutional changes. Their presentation is likely to be taken by Albanians 
as a declaration of war. 
</P>
<P>
Albanian political leaders like Rugova and local newspaper editor Veton Surroi 
have appealed to Kosovo's majority to stay calm and wait out the Serbian 
standoff on elections. 
</P>
<P>
"We have in the past been very brave and very emotional; now we are learning 
how to be patient," said Surroi, who nevertheless fears an explosion of 
violence when Serbia moves to protect its control over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more confrontation," Surroi said, adding that he can see no 
willingness to compromise by the Serbian leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Selmni, an ethnic Albanian who emigrated to Canada 14 years ago, was in 
Kosovo recently to visit relatives. He and his Canadian-born wife, Miliana, 
said Albanian friends and relatives are fearful of an explosion of violence 
once the gauntlet of constitutional change is thrown down. 
</P>
<P>
Selmni said he was told that Serbian secret police have been burning files in 
fear of an imminent uprising. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a bloody battle," his wife predicted, "but eventually these 
people (the Albanians) are going to win."

East German authorities captured a reputed leftist terrorist linked to the 1985 
bombing of a U.S. air base in West Germany and the deaths of three Americans, 
officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sigrid Sternebeck, 40, became the seventh alleged member of the notorious Red 
Army Faction to be captured in East Germany in the last 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
The string of arrests is the result of a recent push by officials in both 
German states to locate long-sought terrorist suspects who received sanctuary 
under East Germany's former Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest was reported during the night by East German authorities through the 
government news agency ADN and confirmed by West German federal police 
spokesman Hans-Juergen Foerster. 
</P>
<P>
Sternebeck is charged with the slaying of U.S. Army soldier Edward Pimental in 
Wiesbaden, West Germany, on Aug. 8, 1985, Foerster said. 
</P>
<P>
He said West Germany would seek the extradition of Sternebeck, who is charged 
in a warrant with murder and attempted murder. Sternebeck did not resist when 
she was arrested in the town of Schwedt, ADN said. 
</P>
<P>
Pimental was killed so terrorists could obtain his identity card and gain entry 
by car to the U.S. air base at Frankfurt, West Germany, Foerster said. The car 
was rigged with explosives and detonated near the headquarters of the base, 
where it killed two other Americans and injured 20.

MAMAIA, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The drive from Bucharest to the Black Sea coast is a three-hour ordeal of 
bumping over rutted roads choked with smoke-spewing trucks, horse-drawn carts 
and wayward livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Once there, Western sun seekers are treated to a low-cost vacation in hotels 
where the coffee machines are idle for want of filters, the bathroom tiles are 
crooked and crumbling, and bands of beggars and money-changers accost visitors 
at every corner. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of two cornerstones the new government expects to prop up 
Romania's sagging economy. The other, agriculture, is an equally dubious source 
of rescue in view of Europe's already flooded food markets. 
</P>
<P>
Romania has virtually no foreign debt, a wealth of natural resources and a 
plentiful and ready work force that Western investors could employ at a bargain 
rate. Nonetheless, despite what appear to be major advantages over other 
westward-looking nations of Eastern Europe, Romania has the toughest road to 
travel to pull itself back from the edge of economic ruin. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the governing National Salvation Front have declared their intention 
to steer the nation toward a free-market system. But they have made clear their 
preference for a slow dismantling of the socialist system in hopes of softening 
transitional blows for a population bruised by half a century of tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
The late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's Draconian practice of exporting food to 
pay off foreign loans drove the nation to the brink of starvation. His 
bulldozing of villages to build agro-industrial collectives destroyed the most 
productive farm sector -- the private plots tended by rural peasants. 
</P>
<P>
Romania suffers the worst case of industrial gigantism in a region renowned for 
prestige projects that wasted resources and polluted the environment. The 
44-mile Danube-Black Sea Canal, vacant of ship traffic, and the nearly complete 
House of the Republic, a Pentagon-sized palace that Ceausescu intended as his 
government headquarters, stand out among the projects that robbed Romanians of 
a bearable living standard. 
</P>
<P>
Even by Eastern Europe's low standards, Romanians are poor. Only 1% of the 
population owns a car. The nation's 23 million citizens use a quarter of the 
electricity consumed per capita in Czechoslovakia. Overall per-capita 
consumption is the equivalent of $67 per month at the inflated official 
exchange rate, less than one-tenth the U.S. average. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions were worsening even before last December's anti-Communist revolt 
deposed Ceausescu and threw the nation into political chaos. Industrial 
production fell more than 2% in 1989, farm output dropped 4.3%, and national 
income plummeted by nearly 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Even sharper declines have been reported this year because of the distraction 
of the revolution and the volatile election campaign that culminated in an 
overwhelming Salvation Front victory. Last week's rioting, in which six people 
were killed and more than 500 injured, seems certain to have a negative effect 
on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the hardest-hit sector is the tourism industry, which officials in this 
coastal resort claimed provided 75% of the nation's hard-currency earnings in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign bookings this summer are down 80% from last year," lamented Pompiliu 
Dimancea, general manager of the state-run Litoral travel network that owns 
Black Sea resorts like Mamaia, just north of the port of Constanta. 
</P>
<P>
Another Litoral executive, Ion Nichita, says the cash crop of coastal visitors 
has failed this year because of the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Romania has the same image as Beirut. People think there is gunfire in the 
streets. It's only natural that they don't want to come here on vacation," 
Nichita said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are using the lull in Western traffic to reorganize in hopes of 
catching the wave of Western visitors to the East next season. Most of the 
hotels along the white-sand strip south of the Danube Delta need 
air-conditioning, more modern plumbing and dependable food-service equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Ice-cream makers, coffee machines, juice squeezers and other appliances 
purchased during the 1970s buildup had to be sidelined for lack of spare parts 
or regular supplies, Nichita said. 
</P>
<P>
That situation could change, however, if the new government continues its 
policy of selective application of resources. 
</P>
<P>
As the interim governing force before the May 20 election, the Salvation Front 
controlled all funds. It bought food and energy on credit to show immediate 
improvement in the sorry lot of the Romanian consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Interim Prime Minister Petre Roman contended in a recent interview that his 
nation is well-positioned for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
He said the front made no promises of a "bright future" but that Romania's rich 
agricultural heritage and tourist attractions would be relied on to lead the 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Farm output suffered under Ceausescu's rule, but Romania was known as Europe's 
granary before World War II. The soil was so rich in some regions that the 
Nazis shipped it back to Germany by the trainload. 
</P>
<P>
The rolling farmland north of the capital and the wheat fields that stretch 
along the coastal plain are dotted with peasants from daybreak to dusk, a sign 
that new incentives for increased output may be working. 
</P>
<P>
Romanians can sell their privately raised produce at market prices, and the 
government has made vast stretches of land available to those who want to plant 
it. But the effect of that diversion of labor from the state collective farms 
will not be known until fall. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats based in Bucharest noted that the new government is under 
pressure to show steady improvement in living standards and that a bad harvest 
could spell political disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the ambiguity that afflicts the new government, Ioan Popescu, an 
agronomist in Constanta, said farmers will be allowed to sell their produce at 
market prices but that food costs will not rise for the consumer and subsidies 
will be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
Specific steps for economic recovery were never outlined during the election 
campaign, as the candidates concentrated on ideological warfare. The result has 
been a confusing array of declared intentions without credible statistics or 
arguments to back them. 
</P>
<P>
Front politicians have called for putting 30% of Romanian business in private 
hands by the end of this year -- a feat their own economists scoff at as 
unlikely even in five years. 
</P>
<P>
A top official in the Agriculture Ministry, Victor Surdu, boasted that Romania 
could produce enough food to feed 70 million people. But no one has undertaken 
a close look at the hard-currency market for farm products, which the European 
Community is struggling to keep afloat in an ocean of output. 
</P>
<P>
Romania has enacted one of the more liberal foreign investment laws, ostensibly 
allowing up to 100% foreign ownership while encouraging joint ventures over 
outright sales. Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Draganescu has said Romania hopes 
to retain at least a 25% share of most projects involving foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Some prominent West German firms, such as Siemens electronics and the 
Daimler-Benz automotive works, are negotiating major deals with Romania, 
Salvation Front officials claimed. But completed contracts have been few 
despite a fourfold increase in Western business visits this spring. 
</P>
<P>
A British businessman in Bucharest to scout opportunities in agriculture said 
the biggest argument against investment is the threat of further political 
instability. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows if there will be another revolution like the one in December?" he 
said. "No one wants to put his money down in such circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Officials also have predicted that as many as 50,000 privately run firms could 
be in operation by year's end -- an equally questionable projection in view of 
Romanians' dearth of cash to start their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in the country has made enough money -- at least legally -- to buy into 
the state tourist industry," observed Maria-Venera Coitu, a travel bureau 
manager in Constanta. "For now it will remain a state monopoly."

AMERICAN 'LIBERATOR' GIVEN A HERO'S WELCOME IN FRENCH VILLAGE

PLELO, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former U.S. Army Capt. Robert Hamsley returned Saturday to a hero's welcome in 
the Breton village he helped liberate nearly 46 years ago from Nazi German 
occupiers. 
</P>
<P>
Children waved American and French flags to greet Hamsley as he passed through 
the village in a World War II vintage jeep. Nearly all of Plelo's 2,300 
residents turned out to applaud him. 
</P>
<P>
A detachment of U.S. Marines and French soldiers stood by as Hamsley, 71, was 
given the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, one of the nation's most 
distinguished awards. The village sports stadium was renamed in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
Hamsley, of Lawrenceburg, Tenn., and Orlando, Fla., appeared taken aback by the 
acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
"I love you, Plelo," he said in a toast. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony at the village's monument to the dead of World War II, Plelo 
Mayor Yves Le Coqu hailed Hamsley as the village's "American savior." 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1944, Plelo was occupied by the Nazis, who were preparing to carry 
out a series of executions when Hamsley entered the village at the head of a 
five-tank column. 
</P>
<P>
His men wiped out a contingent of the heavily armed Germans. But two days 
later, German antitank guns knocked out four of the five tanks and damaged 
Hamsley's own. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hamsley and his crew managed to destroy the guns and killed or drove 
off about 100 Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Hamsley received a Bronze Star for his action and was promoted from lieutenant 
to captain. But his action was not even reported in the official diaries of the 
15th Cavalry Regiment of Gen. George Patton's Third Army. 
</P>
<P>
The belated recognition was prompted in part by the efforts of a history buff 
who also served in the 15th Cavalry, Robert Dwan of Tucson, Ariz. Dwan, along 
with amateur French historians, pinpointed Hamsley as the hero of Plelo. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Plelo village council named Hamsley an honorary citizen "in 
testimony of our gratitude for your courageous action of Aug. 6, 1944, which 
led to (the village's) liberation."

Authorities briefly lifted a curfew in Srinagar on Saturday to enable an 
estimated 600,000 residents to buy food and other necessities after being 
confined to their homes for four days. 
</P>
<P>
Stores did a brisk business. Residents talked of harassment and house-to-house 
searches by the Indian army during the curfew. 
</P>
<P>
State authorities, who are trying to break a popular independence movement in 
Jammu and Kashmir, reimposed the curfew at noon after a six-hour break. 
</P>
<P>
A "civil curfew" called by Moslem Kashmiri militants also ended Saturday, 
allowing shops and restaurants in the main commercial district to open for the 
first time in three days.

<P>
Central American presidents opened their seventh regional summit Saturday amid 
expressions of hope for economic recovery and an obsession with soccer. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the first formal meeting was delayed by nearly two hours as the 
presidents of Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and 
Panama gathered around television sets to watch the World Cup soccer match 
between Costa Rica and Brazil before getting down to business. 
</P>
<P>
The match, which Brazil won by a score of 1 to 0, was scheduled to begin at the 
exact hour the summit opening ceremonies were to start. 
</P>
<P>
"With all honesty, I have to tell you that we still have not begun the summit 
because we were watching the end of the game," said Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon, emerging from the summit meeting room just after the 
match ended. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech during the summit's opening ceremony in the city 28 miles west of 
Guatemala City, Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo praised what he 
said would be a meeting of hope. 
</P>
<P>
Wars and political conflicts across the region are moving toward resolution, he 
said, and the leaders can now work toward improving battered economies and 
battling poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come to the conclusion that if war is an act of cruelty to humans, 
then poverty is an act of abandonment of humans that we must address," Cerezo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Ariel Rivera Irias said that the ministers had 
agreed on a five-point agenda for the talks: 
</P>
<P>
* Coordinating each country's macroeconomic policies, such as foreign exchange, 
government spending and taxation. 
</P>
<P>
* Coordinating poverty eradication programs. 
</P>
<P>
* Coordinating transportation and telecommunications throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
* Creating a regional agricultural policy. 
</P>
<P>
* Negotiating as a region on trade issues and on the region's foreign debt, 
which is estimated at $21.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Panama has attended a summit of Central American 
presidents. Panama, which declared its independence from Colombia in 1903, has 
traditionally not been considered a part of Central America. 
</P>

Secretary of State James A. Baker III is to arrive tonight to meet with each of 
the presidents after the summit.

<P>
The Sri Lankan government and Tamil rebels agreed Saturday to an unconditional 
end to fighting that has raged for almost a week and left nearly 500 dead, 
government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But battles raged until the cease-fire took effect near dusk. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, effective at 6 p.m., was reached after seven hours of talks 
between Justice Minister Shahul Hameed, the government's chief negotiator, and 
leaders of the dominant rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Hameed telephoned officials in Colombo with the news from the port town of 
Jaffna, 180 miles north of the capital, where the negotiations were held at a 
heavily guarded rebel office, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and rebel leaders planned to tour areas where fighting has raged to 
see what could be done to restore normalcy, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted last Tuesday in Sri Lanka's northern and eastern 
provinces, home to most of the nation's 3 million Tamils. 
</P>
<P>
The government and the Tigers had agreed to a cease-fire earlier in the week, 
but it failed and battles erupted in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting was reported Saturday around Trincomalee, 135 miles northeast of 
Colombo, and in the east coast's Batticaloa district, where soldiers battled to 
regain control of several police stations captured by the rebels and to stop 
attacks on at least three military camps, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of soldiers, police, rebels and civilians were killed in last week's 
fighting. The dead include about 175 police officers captured and later 
executed by rebels, police and military sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have died in ethnic violence since 1983, when Tamil 
militants began waging a bloody campaign to establish the northern and eastern 
provinces as an independent homeland for the Tamils, who are predominantly 
Hindu. 
</P>
<P>
Tamils are demanding a separate state because of years of alleged 
discrimination by the majority Buddhist Sinhalese, who control the Colombo 
government.

<P>
With the once-raging fire aboard the tanker Mega Borg extinguished, efforts 
turned Saturday to protecting Texas beaches from the remnants of 4.6-million 
gallons of crude oil spilled from the crippled tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials at a briefing said the fire that once engulfed the stern 
of the tanker and created a 1,500-foot-long stream of burning oil on the 
surface of the Gulf of Mexico was smothered late Friday by a final application 
of chemical foam. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation right now offshore (on the tanker) is stable," Lt. Cmdr. Frank 
Whipple said Saturday afternoon. "The fire is officially out." 
</P>
<P>
Salvage crews said a crude oil leak from one of the 853-foot tanker's storage 
compartments had dwindled to virtually nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Whipple said the latest estimate of the spill was 4.6-million gallons, although 
only 12,000 to 40,000 gallons were believed still to be in the water, the rest 
having either burned, evaporated or been eaten by experimental microbes. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers planned a second experiment Saturday to gauge the effectiveness of 
bacteria on an oil spill at sea after the first test went awry and yielded no 
data, according to scientists circling the vicinity of the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to test whether the microbes would digest the oil and turn it 
into harmless byproducts, the bacteria were sprayed Friday onto part of the oil 
slick by University of Texas oceanographer Carl Oppenheimer, who had collected 
the creatures from dozens of oily locales worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But the portion of the oil slick that was sprayed was not marked by a buoy or 
enclosed with floating booms. "Right now, the probability of determining 
whether the bacteria had any effect is zero," said Terry Wade, chief scientist 
with the Geochemical and Environmental Group at Texas A&amp;M, who was aboard a 
research vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The leading edge of an oil sheen moved Saturday to within 13 miles of Galveston 
Island and thousands of vacationers playing in the sun and surf. Prevailing 
currents, however, moved the oil parallel to the coast and not even tar balls 
were expected to hit land before today or Monday, if then. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concentrating on hitting the oil while it's offshore," Lt. Cmdr. Whipple 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Five oil skimmers were working the closest sheen, trying to scoop up whatever 
dense oil there might be. Other skimmers worked on widely scattered patches of 
oil and sheens farther offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Edward Klima of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said 
aerial sweeps have been made to monitor the impact on fish and other marine 
life, particularly dolphins and loggerhead turtles. He said three dirtied 
loggerhead turtles were captured and would be treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
"The dolphins appear to be behaving in a normal manner, but they did move away 
from the oil," he said. "Our concern is they tend to eat tar balls, and if they 
continue to do that, they die." 
</P>
<P>
With the chances dropping for the tanker to spill the rest of its cargo, 
residents on shore began to relax. 
</P>
<P>
"We can breathe something of a sigh of relief now that the fire is out," said 
Buck Wynne of the Texas Water Commission. "But the ship is still full of oil, 
so we can't breathe too easily." 
</P>
<P>
The maritime drama began late June 8, when an explosion ripped through the 
engine room of the tanker. A fleet of boats and other craft fought the 
spectacular fire and finally gained the upper hand last Friday.

JUROR IN MCMARTIN CASE DISMISSED FOR FOLLOWING NEWS ACCOUNTS OF TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A juror in the retrial of McMartin Pre-School defendant Ray Buckey was removed 
from the child molestation case for following media accounts of the trial, a 
district attorney's office spokeswoman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the juror was not expected to jeopardize the case because four 
alternates remain and the trial appears to be nearing its end. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg replaced the juror, a male who was not 
identified, on Friday. Neither defense nor prosecuting attorneys objected to 
the change, said spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid outside influence, jurors are admonished not to read newspapers, watch 
television news or discuss the case with friends or family. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole point of a trial is for the jury to decide a case based on the 
information provided in the courtroom," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's action was the second time in this case a juror on the 12-person panel 
had been lost since the retrial began on May 7. On the first day, a juror was 
replaced after she began coughing violently, an apparent reaction to smoke 
inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's retrial is expected to conclude next month. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's first trial, the longest and costliest criminal trial in U.S. history, 
teetered on the brink of a mistrial when all six alternate jurors eventually 
were called to serve. In that trial, which ended in January, Buckey's mother, 
Peggy McMartin Buckey, was acquitted and the jury could not agree on 13 charges 
against Buckey. He is being retried on eight of those charges.

DON ALEXANDER; HEALTH IDEAS STIRRED FUROR 
</P>

By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Dale Alexander, controversial nutrition theorist, lecturer and writer who 
advocated taking cod liver oil and orange juice for the treatment of arthritis, 
has died. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who was one of 11 California gubernatorial candidates in 1966, died 
Friday at Veterans Administration Hospital in Westwood of heart complications. 
</P>
<P>
A popular lecturer at health and nutrition seminars for four decades, Alexander 
achieved international attention in the 1950s with his first book, "Arthritis 
and Common Sense," which was excerpted in the Los Angeles Times in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
The book, written in 1951, became a best seller in 1957 and ultimately sold 
more than 1 million copies in six languages. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander appeared on national network television shows including Johnny Carson 
and Merv Griffin, and his theories were described in Life and other national 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"Through study, logic and common sense we have decided that arthritis is 
basically an oil deficiency in the human body and a lack of Vitamin D," 
Alexander wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"To restore the proper amounts of Vitamin D to your system -- the right kind of 
vitamins and lubricating oils -- we recommend the use of cod liver oil mixed 
with orange juice." 
</P>
<P>
He also advocated a precise sequence in which foods should be eaten. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission accused Alexander of making false and 
unsubstantiated claims and at one point issued a cease-and-desist order against 
his publishing company, Witkower Press Inc., of Hartford, Conn., to halt 
further publication of the book. 
</P>
<P>
An FTC examiner found an "impressive lack of medical or other training or 
education which would fit Alexander to write a book on such a recognized 
subject as arthritis." 
</P>
<P>
The examiner characterized Alexander's statements in radio interviews as 
"merely a hodgepodge of scientific falderal and medical mumbo jumbo." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander wrote four other books on nutrition and health, all published by his 
Witkower Press: "Good Health and Common Sense," "The Common Cold and Common 
Sense," "Healthy Hair and Common Sense" and "Dry Skin and Common Sense." 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Los Angeles for the last 30 years, Alexander filed as a candidate 
for governor in the Democratic primary election of 1966, challenging incumbent 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown, who was renominated but lost the election to Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander's 21-plank platform opposed fluoridated drinking water and advocated 
nighttime pari-mutuel racing and a state lottery to help finance a rapid 
transit system for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Norwich, Conn., on July 18, 1919, Alexander attended the Norwich Free 
Academy and Trinity College in Connecticut and Columbia University, New York. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his second wife, Ida Fischer Alexander, two sons and one 
daughter from his previous marriage, and two grandchildren.

POLICE OFFICERS OVERCOME BY PCP FUMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Hawthorne police officers were briefly hospitalized for chemical poisoning 
early Saturday when they were overcome by fumes while arresting a man whose 
truck allegedly contained several 55-gallon containers of PCP. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the drugs had a street value of $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, whose names were not released, were on patrol at 116th Street and 
Doty Avenue about 4 a.m. when they saw a rented U-Haul truck pull out of a 
Century Freeway construction area, said Hawthorne Sgt. Henry Mashack. 
Suspecting that the driver was trying to steal construction equipment, the 
officers pulled over the truck and looked inside, Mashack said. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly overcome by the smell of petroleum, which is frequently associated 
with the manufacture of PCP, the officers called the Hawthorne Fire Department, 
the hazardous materials team and narcotics detectives, Mashack said. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents were evacuated until detectives determined the substance was 
PCP, Mashack said. Residents were allowed to return to their homes about 9 
a.m., Mashack said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, who were starting to act "real goofy," were taken to Robert F. 
Kennedy Medical Center, Mashack said. When they arrived, "they couldn't even 
write their names. They were writing in circles," Mashack said. The officers 
were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
William Cornelius Thomas, 29, of Inglewood was booked on suspicion of 
possessing PCP for sale and manufacture. He was being held without bail at 
Hawthorne jail.

GROOMS KEEP COMING BACK TO THE TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL POINDEXTER, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only once before in my life have I ever been a groom for a day, and that was on 
a scorching June afternoon in a tiny Lake Tahoe wedding chapel nearly four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I heard "Congratulations" at least 100 times -- once for every person packed 
into the little chapel built for 50. I also spoke those two words that come 
with the prize package: "I do." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, that is what I said when asked recently if I would like to 
be a groom for a day -- but a groom of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
It is June 6. The setting is the Bob Gordon Stable at Cal Expo race track in 
Sacramento. My attire consists of a pair of holey Nikes, a pair of holey Levis 
and a worn-out T-shirt. Throughout the day I sweat profusely, and my feet, 
legs, arms and back ache. The only fragrance to fill my nostrils is from 
whatever the stable's tenants ate the night before, and I am nibbled about the 
arm by a 2-year-old attention-loving filly named PT Power. The cool breeze on 
my perspiring body, combined with the swirling dust and hay, makes me sneeze 
... and sneeze ... and sneeze ... 
</P>
<P>
Being a harness racing groom is akin to being a mechanic for Arie Luyendyk. The 
TV cameras focused on Luyendyk and his racer as he zoomed around the track on 
his way to victory in the recent Indianapolis 500. But the mechanics 
responsible for building and maintaining the engine over that grueling 500-mile 
grind were basically anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
In harness racing, as in any racing, all eyes are on the track -- horse and 
driver. John Q. Public has no idea or concern who groomed the horse. The groom 
is never seen, but it's the groom who is responsible for the care and feeding 
of the horse. 
</P>
<P>
"The groom knows if a hair is out of line," Gordon says. "Their job is the 
basic health of the horse." 
</P>
<P>
The groom is paid for each horse for which he or she is responsible. Some 
grooms make a decent living. Others live in tack rooms on the grounds because 
they can't afford anything else. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say grooms are spinning their wheels. They can go on to be a 
second trainer or a driver. But as Gordon says, "You have to pay your dues." 
</P>
<P>
The groom's days are long and hard, some longer and harder than others. My day 
as a groom started at 6 a.m., when the alarm clock went off. It's about 9 1/2 
hours of work spread over three shifts. Counting free time in between shifts -- 
though there's not really enough time to get anything accomplished -- it's a 17 
1/2-hour day. I've always hated split shifts. This one I don't mind because I 
know it's a one-time gig. For grooms, it's a daily event. But they don't seem 
to mind. 
</P>
<P>
They do it because they love it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the job," says Paula Hayward, who grooms for Gordon and acts as 
my tutor. "You don't like it, you go work somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
She considers our day together easy because she only has to jog two horses. 
Another doesn't go on the track at all because he is racing this night. On a 
"busy" day, Hayward may train two horses, meaning they will make two trips 
each, possibly three, to the track. 
</P>
<P>
Hayward considers the day easy, but I'm ready to call it a day at 11:30 a.m. 
And there is another 12 hours of work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
Hayward has worked with horses virtually all her life. She has been a harness 
groom since she came to California from her native England seven years ago. She 
teaches me plenty in our day together, and she puts me to work. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it went on this "easy" day -- yeah, right -- in the life of a groom: 
</P>
<P>
I arrive at Stable M behind the Cal Expo track and watch as Paula finishes 
jogging PT Power, a massive but cuddly 2-year-old filly who shows potential. 
</P>
<P>
For now, it's watch and learn. Paula sponge-bathes PT Power with warm water, 
then scrapes the excess wetness. She puts a blanket over the filly, who soaks 
up the attention, and leads her to the mechanically operated walker, where she 
will walk for about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
While the stall is empty, Paula shows me how to clean it: Park your wheelbarrow 
by the gate, use the pitchfork to pick up any leftover hay -- "If they haven't 
eaten it by now, they're not going to," she says -- and pick up the massive 
piles of droppings and wet spots. Finally, smooth out the wood shavings, the 
horse's bedding, and get a wheelbarrow full of fresh shavings if needed. 
</P>
<P>
In the stall to PT Power's left is Speedy Alba N, a 5-year-old gelding who is 
racing this night in the first leg of The Great Western Pace. His name is 
fitting. On May 26, in his first pari-mutuel start on American soil, the New 
Zealand-bred horse won in a blazing 1:54 3/5. His competition this night is 
tough, but he will be the betting favorite. 
</P>
<P>
I lead Speedy to the walker and hook him up. Then I get to muck his stall. 
"There's a pile," I'm thinking as I sling the pitchfork. So that's what's left 
of the hay you dined on when I was here yesterday. Paula says I've done a good 
job; she gives me a B+. 
</P>
<P>
Then Paula and second trainer Robert Bell ask if I want to take Shahman, the 
third horse Paula grooms, for a jog on the track. They hand me a helmet. I knew 
this was coming. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
Shahman is a 4-year-old pacing gelding. He generally minds his manners but 
tends to get carried away after he warms up on the track. I'm not worried, 
because Robert is going to ride alongside me on the jog cart. He shows me how 
to board the cart -- "Sit on from the side, and spin your legs around to the 
front" -- and how to handle the reins. 
</P>
<P>
We get almost past the stable and near the street parallel to the backstretch 
of the track. "OK, pull him to the right and he'll go right onto the street," 
Robert says. So I do. ... "But wait until you get past the building," Robert 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
Shahman strolls to the hill entering the track. We no sooner get on the track 
when another trainer-driver, Larry Gregory, goes buzzing by and lets out a 
blood-curdling scream of terror. He is poking fun at the rookie driver on the 
track. It feels like driver's training all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Robert says Shahman will walk for about one-eighth of a mile, and he is right. 
Once we hit the first turn, Shahman picks up a little speed. He wants to go 
inside, and when I steer him back to the outside he turns it up another notch. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, no -- we're pacing, and we're getting out of control. Robert grabs the 
reins. Shahman keeps rumbling right along. "Hey, hey, HEY, HEY, HEY," Roberts 
yells, but Shahman appears to be having fun giving the rookie driver a hard 
time. Once the horse is under control, I get the reins back, and Shahman minds 
his manners the rest of the way around the track. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the stable, after I come down from my Shahman rush, I'm yawning. I fill 
Speedy's water bucket, feed him hay and wrap some bandages, which will be 
applied to PT Power's legs later. 
</P>
<P>
Then I give Shahman a bath and scrape him. He is cooperating nicely. After 
washing Shahman, I graduate to washing the jog carts. Hey, grooms do 
EVERYTHING. 
</P>
<P>
Paula then gives PT a syringe full of Sulfa Trimeth. PT was sick the week 
before with a fever and a cough. It's oral medication, but I'll watch from 
outside the gate, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon walks over. He wants me to take Taking What's Left, a 2-year-old colt, 
out for a three-mile jog. THREE MILES? This time Gordon rides with me. Taking 
What's Left may be just a baby, but he jogs nicely. Gordon seems to be along 
for the ride. He says I'm doing just fine, despite the mud flying into my face. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the stable again, there is no time to rest. Paula wraps PT Power's legs 
in bandages to sweat them, which draws out any soreness and keeps the legs 
tight. Then she applies Blue Lotion, which smells and acts like Ben-Gay, to her 
stifles, the inside part of her upper legs. I'm still watching and learning. 
</P>
<P>
The work pace isn't hectic, but it's brisk. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's back over to Speedy Alba's stall. New Zealand-bred horses generally 
get sick when they first come to the United States, but Speedy hasn't yet. 
Paula is going to take his temperature -- anally. No, thanks, I'll watch from 
outside the gate. Speedy's temperature is 99 degrees, which is normal. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's back over Shahman's stall. I pack his feet with mud -- thank you, 
Shahman, for not kicking me upside the head -- and rub in Blue Lotion to his 
stifles. Paula says they sometimes don't like the Blue Lotion treatment, but 
Shahman behaves. 
</P>
<P>
Then it's time to sweep up Paula's three-stall area. They didn't have to teach 
me this. I sweep until I can't sweep anymore. The area is immaculate, but in a 
few hours it will need sweeping again. 
</P>
<P>
It's 11:30 a.m. My feet hurt, my back hurts and my legs hurt. We're done for 
the morning, but we are to be back at 4:30 p.m. for feeding. 
</P>
<P>
And this is an EASY day. 
</P>
<P>
This shift takes no more than 30 minutes. Chow time for the horses is a pretty 
loose time around the stable. 
</P>
<P>
Less than six hours from race time, Speedy Alba N gets barley, oats and 
molasses. PT Power gets the entree plus an inoculation of Vitamin E and 
Silenium. PT Power doesn't care for inoculations. Paula comforts her. I watch 
from outside the gate. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a time to pick up any loose droppings in the stalls, which I do. It 
seemed so much easier to stomach shoveling it in the morning, when it wasn't so 
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
During this free-and-easy time, Paula offers me a taste of a liquid called 
"Wind and Cough Remedy." Its ingredients include honey, apple cider vinegar, 
aloe vera, alcohol, menthol, lemon juice and oil of eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds harmless. "Just a drop on your tongue," Paula says with some warning 
in her voice. A drop was all I took, but it lit my head on fire. It also 
temporarily unclogged my hay fever-infested sinuses. 
</P>
<P>
It's 5 p.m. We're done -- until 7. 
</P>
<P>
I'm tired, I'm sore and I need a shower. Even the dogs and cats who slumber 
away the day at the stable can't stand to be near me. And we still have about 
five hours of work to do. 
</P>
<P>
PT Power and Shahman are put to bed, and now the attention is focused on Speedy 
Alba N. 
</P>
<P>
He is back on the walker, and I spread out some fresh wood shavings in his 
stall. Breathing the dust from the shavings doesn't do my allergy any good, so 
I try covering my nose and mouth with the neck of my T-shirt. Wow, that's even 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Speedy is calm as Paula puts on his harness, saddle pad, girth and breast 
collar. I put on the crupper, a leather strap that loops under the tail and 
attaches to the harness. I hope Speedy doesn't mind my lifting his tail. He 
doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Paula says I'm a quick learner. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't blame tonight on him if something goes wrong," Robert says to Paula. 
</P>
<P>
They tell me that if Speedy wins, I should go to the winner's circle to be in 
the picture. I'll go for that. 
</P>
<P>
After the second race, two hours before race time, Speedy takes a two-mile jog. 
By choice, I'm pretty much staying out of the way now, at least when it comes 
to handling Speedy. It's business, so I let Robert and Paula do most of the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
When Speedy comes in, he gets another warm sponge bath and retires to his 
stall. 
</P>
<P>
The crew will wait three more races before going to the paddock, an enclosed 
stable area near the track where the horses are cared for before the race. 
</P>
<P>
Paula assembles her bucket full of tools in preparation for the trip to the 
paddock: sponge and scraper, a towel to wipe his face, a sweat sheet, Blue 
Lotion, cooler blanket and clamp. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, it's a time for taking it easy. 
</P>
<P>
Robert flirts with PT Power. He plants a kiss on her nose, which she doesn't 
seem to like much. (I think she's playing hard to get; she loves attention.) I 
flirt with her, and she nibbles playfully on my arm before taking a chunk out 
of my jacket sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
The third race is going off now. I sit on the rail of the backstretch watching 
the horses thunder by. The sun is setting in the west, painting the many vapor 
trails in the sky streams of pink and orange. There's a small crowd on this 
night. The cold wind obviously has kept some people away. I tack three more 
sneezes onto my total. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the stable there is lots of small talk. Suzanne Whitteaker, who grooms 
three horses next to Paula in the Gordon stable, has returned from dinner to 
tell of the gathering of Deadheads in the back end of the grounds. She and 
Paula tell a story of a fellow they met at the Los Alamitos meet in 1988, of 
how he showed up one day and took a job with trainer Art Porrine, only to 
disappear after the Grateful Dead had come and gone. 
</P>
<P>
The call for the fifth race sounds, meaning it's time to take Speedy to the 
paddock. Paula and Robert drive Speedy over. I take the van. 
</P>
<P>
After the fifth race, Robert drives Speedy on his warm-up mile. 
</P>
<P>
"How is he?" I ask Robert. 
</P>
<P>
"You ready to get your picture taken?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
When Speedy returns to the paddock, he is sweating and shaking his head in 
discomfort. Paula says his head itches, so she takes his bridle off and wipes 
his head with a towel. Speedy enjoys this. 
</P>
<P>
Paula chains him to a paddock stall. I hold Speedy's head while Paula gives him 
yet another sponge bath before putting on his blanket and applying more Blue 
Lotion. 
</P>
<P>
Paula is in the same mood she was at 7 a.m.: bright and cheery, smiling most of 
the time. I'm ready to crash in the first available stall. 
</P>
<P>
Speedy seems a bit nervous, probably because of the noise of the crowd and 
screaming kids, Paula says. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it's race time. Speedy and driver Robert Sleeth are on the track 
warming up for the race. Almost half the win money is bet on Speedy, who is the 
4-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"They're off and pacing," track announcer Joe Alto says. 
</P>
<P>
Speedy, starting from the seventh post position, has some ground to make up. 
It's a quick first quarter-mile (27 3/5 seconds). He is second at the half-mile 
pole. I'm cheering for him as if I had raised him from infancy. He is 
challenging for the lead heading into the stretch, but he loses steam near the 
finish and places third, 1 1/2 lengths behind. Boston Byrd A wins in a quick 
1:56 1/5. Vital N is second. 
</P>
<P>
Robert isn't disappointed. "The first quarter was too fast," he says. "He 
started on the outside and had to work to get to the top. He tried to slow down 
going down the back side, then (Eminem) pulled and went, so we had to go with 
that horse. He just got a little tired." 
</P>
<P>
Paula says, "He raced tough. The track was hard work for them tonight." 
</P>
<P>
So is it over yet? Hardly. Paula and Robert were counting on a trip to the 
"spit box," the area where drug testing is done, because Speedy went off as the 
favorite. We can count on another hour or so of work, more if Speedy doesn't 
have to go to the bathroom. Horses can be kept at the "spit box" until 2 a.m., 
or until they go to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Paula drives Speedy to the spit box, where she walks him while she waits her 
turn to be tested. Speedy's back legs are stiff and he is coughing, meaning his 
throat is irritated. They think he may be getting sick. Paula keeps walking 
him, and he seems to be walking the stiffness out. They'll know the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
It is the groom's responsibility to sign over the sealed vials of blood and 
urine after the testing is completed. Fortunately, Speedy goes right away. 
</P>
<P>
Paula leads Speedy back toward the stable, asking me on her way by if I 
wouldn't mind bringing the sulky. Robert tells me to hop on the tailgate of his 
truck and he'll pull the bike. I oblige. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheater," Paula yells as we drive by. 
</P>
<P>
At the stable, I find the energy to get Paula a bucket of warm water, which she 
will use to wash the bridle and harness. 
</P>
<P>
Speedy walks a little more and retires. 
</P>
<P>
It's past 11:30 p.m. I feel too tired to drive home. Paula will be back at the 
track the next morning at 7. She'll be up at 5:15. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't seem to bother her in the least. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't bother me, either. My alarm won't be going off.

AT 39, DAVE PARKER STILL SWINGING WITH POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HENNEMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At one time he was considered the most complete player in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
His offensive skills featured blacksmith power and wide receiver speed in a 
tight end body. Defensively, sure hands and a rocket arm earned him three Gold 
Gloves. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in the shadow of Willie Stargell, the "We Are Family" leader of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. It was the late 1970s and early 1980s, and Dave Parker 
ushered in the era of seven-figure contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is the turn of another decade, the past is clouded by an ugly drug trial 
and a lawsuit brought against him by the Pittsburgh club. Parker is three teams 
removed from the Pirates, still an imposing physical specimen, but not the 
dominating performer he was in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
His career probably extended by the designated hitter rule, Parker is in his 
third year in the American League. After two seasons in Oakland, during which 
the A's started what many consider a dynasty with two pennants and a world 
championship, he has taken his elder statesman role to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5, 230-pound left-handed hitter ended up with the Brewers as a free 
agent because the A's felt they had enough hitters to pick up his at-bats, even 
though Parker led them in RBIs last year. It was a decision that didn't 
surprise Parker, but is not one with which he necessarily agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some indication it would be a problem to sign there again," said Parker. 
"With the kind of talent the A's have, they probably felt they didn't have to 
gamble on 38-year-old Dave Parker. 
</P>
<P>
"As it looks now, it hasn't hurt them yet," he said. "But I think there are 
some teams over there (the Western Division) who could come at them, and if it 
tightens up, they might find I could've been used." 
</P>
<P>
The words roll easily, without noticeable resentment, but it's obvious Parker 
felt his presence in Oakland went beyond his 97 RBI last year. "I think I 
played a role for them," he said. "I think I helped show them what it took to 
win. I represented a lot to them in Oakland." 
</P>
<P>
In Milwaukee, Parker joined a pair of home-grown leaders in Robin Yount and 
Paul Molitor. His major contribution has been to lend some stability as the 
designated hitter, a role that has been generally unproductive for the Brewers 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
A .322 average and 37 RBI, prior to Thursday night's game in Baltimore, is an 
indication that there is still productivity in Parker's bat. "The first year 
(in the American League) was an adjustment," he said. "There's definitely a 
difference in the strike zone. That first year I had no clue what was a strike. 
But then again it was up to me to adjust to them (the American League umpires). 
The second year you know what to expect, you have an idea about the pitchers 
and how they'll throw to you. Last year I was real productive and this year I 
think will surpass last year." 
</P>
<P>
Parker isn't the all-around threat he once was, because time rarely allows such 
a luxury, and he has no trouble admitting as much. "You start with the physical 
side of it," he said, applying pre-game balm to knees that have paid a toll to 
AstroTurf fields. "I've lost foot speed -- my position by now would probably be 
first base. That's where I expected to be playing at this stage of my career. 
</P>
<P>
"But nothing has been lost from my bat speed," said Parker, who hit his fifth 
home run and drove in three runs against the Orioles Wednesday night. "And 
mentally, I'm more mature, smarter. My approach to the game is a help to other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Parker's self-analysis of his career makes it obvious that he also finds 
satisfaction with his approach. "I'm totally content with myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"After going through all the trouble in Pittsburgh, the drug trial, the 
lawsuit, to be on top of my game and now to get some added praise makes me very 
content." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably there is the question as to whether Parker perceives himself now as 
he did Stargell during his early years with the Pirates. "All of that 
(leadership) is gained by what you've achieved in baseball," Parker said of the 
Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Willie and I came in by different directions. I'm a verbalizer, a 
little more of a free spirit than some others, so I think the younger guys feel 
they can identify with me. They know I've been through some adversities, so 
maybe I can understand them better." 
</P>
<P>
If Parker's game plan holds up, he'll put up a few more numbers for the younger 
players to digest. "I'd like to play 20 years," said Parker, who is in his 18th 
season in the big leagues. "I should be around 2,600 hits by the end of the 
year and if it looks like 3,000 hits is in the cards after the next two years, 
then hopefully I'll be able to stay around."

A PSYCHOANALYSIS OF STRAWBERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My analyst phoned the other day; he wanted to talk about Darryl Strawberry. 
Obviously. Strawberry fascinates my analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Has there been a sports figure in New York more analyzed and psychoanalyzed 
than Strawberry? Why does he? And -- more often -- why doesn't he? He doesn't 
even have to be lying down to be on the couch. 
</P>
<P>
And now the New York Mets right fielder is hitting like anything, which was 
just what he wasn't doing. And why didn't he do it before? 
</P>
<P>
Here is this volatile athlete who has run a boundless career into a barrier, 
was treated for a problem identified as alcoholism, and who is in the prickly 
last year of his contract. Clearly, he is an enigma wrapped in a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Saretsky is a psychoanalyst and clinical professor of psychoanalysis at 
Adelphi University. He is fascinated by Strawberry's psychological profile as 
much as he loves Strawberry's swing. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatry is still an inexact science, like the art of scouting baseball 
talent. Two weeks ago Saretsky prescribed "patience," even though he recognizes 
Strawberry has been, in most clinical terms, "a real pill." His prognosis is a 
definite maybe. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was only normal for a person who comes out of treatment for 
alcoholism to be submerged in depression, and then to emerge. You know, 90 
percent of baseball is half mental. 
</P>
<P>
The classic case was Darrell Porter, a wonderfully aggressive catcher who came 
out of drug treatment and an immersion in religion as a totally passive player 
whose career soon ended. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates saw no fire in Strawberry; he was never a passive hitter until last 
season. He grumbled about the bench not being supportive and vowed to be gone 
from New York because Davey Johnson was fired. Goodness knows, Strawberry's 
performance and behavior helped push Johnson out the door. 
</P>
<P>
After the layer of addictive behavior is treated, Saretsky said, what remains 
is frequently "core behavior." It is what drove the person to be addictive. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms would include "difficulty in concentrating, difficulty in making 
decisions, mood swings, feelings of resentment, being argumentative and being 
easily irritated. They can make him seem uncaring and insensitive to teammates 
and family members, and he could seem unmotivated and unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
From that, comes "a mishmash of acting out bad behavior." 
</P>
<P>
This diagnosis comes from watching games, reading newspapers and watching 
television. Saretsky often sounds as if he had observed the clubhouse, too. 
"What happens in good treatment is the more outlandish aspects of behavior 
subside and what you're left with is the depression," he said. "Even though a 
depressive doesn't sound so great, it's a healthier aspect." 
</P>
<P>
Ballplayers often motivate each other with goading. Teammates have been 
uncertain of how to approach Strawberry. Manager Bud Harrelson is probably more 
attuned to psychology than Johnson was, but to Strawberry the change of 
managers represented one more part of life out of his control. 
</P>
<P>
"The person who thrives best is relatively independent," Saretsky said. "He 
takes his work very seriously and gets down on himself when he doesn't do well, 
but it doesn't become his whole life. A person with Strawberry's disposition is 
going to be very vulnerable to things that inevitably happen to all of us: not 
being perfect." 
</P>
<P>
That makes him easily derailed. Saretsky recalled how New York Giants Manager 
Leo Durocher could drive Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Don Newcombe to distraction 
by screaming from the third-base coach's box. "Somehow Strawberry has to raise 
his threshold to things like that," Saretsky said. 
</P>
<P>
It would ease his life if Strawberry developed more aspects of his personality, 
but he didn't get to the big leagues as an oil painter. Growing up in a broken 
home is never left behind entirely. "Frequently when people have impoverished 
childhoods as Strawberry did -- not financially but in terms of loving -- they 
compensate by childhood feelings of omnipotence and grandiosity," Saretsky said 
. "For those fortunate few who can combine that with a genuine skill, it can be 
a ride to the top. If the personality is fragile besides, and people expect you 
to be a black Ted Williams, you can crack from the strain. It's almost as if 
your entire personal identity is based on facing the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have high potential and who have actual success early in their 
careers and their happiness is too intimately tied to their success at work, at 
some point there's going to be a breakdown, as there was in Strawberry's case." 
</P>
<P>
My analyst was sure Strawberry's recovery would take him past the passive 
period. "When he came out of it, as he may be, I would expect he could harness 
the aggression to lash out at the ball," Saretsky said, "rather than leave it 
to turn inward and become self-destructive." 
</P>
<P>
In his last 17 games before Monday night, Strawberry scalded the ball at .375 
with eight home runs and 17 RBI. Now, should the Mets offer him a big contract 
to keep him, or not? What he is doing now they won't get anyplace else. But who 
knows how long it will last? 
</P>
<P>
"If I were advising (Mets general manager) Frank Cashen, I'd ask him how many 
years he wanted," Saretsky said. "I'd ask, would you take Darryl Strawberry as 
he is for the next three years -- with all the ups and downs? Because that's 
what you can look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I would like to see a little more before I decide.

ERROR-PRONE WEST PICKED CLEAN BY EAST IN SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITTORIO TAFUR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How much fun are seven errors and an 8-3 loss? 
</P>
<P>
That was the question of the day Saturday at Cal State Northridge, where the 
East squad, aided by six West errors, scored two earned runs en route to a 
lopsided victory in the Daily News all-star softball game. 
</P>
<P>
While the West dismissed the game as a meaningless, rollicking outing, East 
Coach Al Weil thought that excuse was as poor as some of the plays in the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you play to have fun," the coach said, "but if you're not going to play 
to win, why play?" 
</P>
<P>
Kym Weil, who plays for her father at Hart High, struck out the first five 
batters she faced and had a perfect game when she was taken out after four 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander, who was 26-3 with an 0.33 earned-run average this season, 
returned in the eighth to pitch another perfect inning. Weil, the game's most 
valuable player, then gave up five singles and two earned runs in the final 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
She finished with 12 strikeouts in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone feels that the City and (Southern) sections are the same, but they're 
totally different," the Southern Section 4-A Division co-Player of the Year 
said. "There's a lot more talent in the (Southern) Section. It's a lot harder 
to win the (Southern Section) title than it is the City." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the victorious East players are from Southern Section teams, and most 
of the West players represented City schools. 
</P>
<P>
While Weil was using her rising fastball to strike out nine in the first four 
innings, throwing only 42 pitches, her teammates staked her to a 3-0 lead 
behind one infield single -- one of two hits surrendered by El Camino Real 
pitcher Chrissy Peck in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
The decisive run scored in the bottom of the sixth when Brandy Rico of Saugus 
hit a two-run double to center field off Chatsworth pitcher Kathy Regan. Those 
were the East's only earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't think of reasons for errors," West Coach Neils Ludlow of El Camino 
Real said. "We made a lot of mistakes that we normally wouldn't make. But the 
main things are that everybody got a chance to play and that the girls had fun. 
Not the outcome."

HORTON OVERHAULS DAVIS TO WIN POINTS RACE AT ENCINO VELODROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Katie Horton of Montrose came from two points behind to win the senior women's 
points race, 18-14, over Esther Davis of the CeloPacific team Saturday night at 
the Encino Velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
Points are awarded to the first four cyclists to cross the start/finish line on 
specified laps in the 12-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
Davis won the first sprint to take a 5-3 advantage but Horton built an 
insurmountable lead during the next five laps. Horton won the final two point 
laps. By the bell lap, Horton had stretched her lead to about 125 meters, half 
the distance around the 250-meter banked track. 
</P>
<P>
Horton rebounded an hour later to easily win a 10-lap, point-per-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
One point is awarded to the first-place cyclist after each lap and then on a 
5-3-2-1 basis at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Horton claimed her second race of the night with 12 points. Davis, with four 
points, again finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia DeCampos of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Michelle 
Lehroff of Antelope Valley Velo finished third and fourth, respectively, in 
both races. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Bengsten of the Velox team won a controversial senior men's points race 
over Chris Johnson of Diamond Back/Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Bengsten and Johnson, who were 1-2 on their final lap, tried surging past a 
pack of about seven riders but got caught in traffic. Erik Hollenbeck of the 
San Diego Bicycle Club was credited with 10 points for being first in the final 
sprint but he actually never finished the race because he stopped one lap 
short. Hollenbeck was third overall. 
</P>
<P>
Bengsten won the competition with eight points and Johnson was second with 
seven. Johnson later held off John Walsh of Montrose in the final stretch to 
win the senior men's miss-and-out. Johnson held a five-meter margin with a lap 
remaining but Walsh closed quickly over the last 100.

LAWN BOWLING: LAID-BACK COMPETITION FOR YOUNG, OLD ALIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PALMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Bernardo's Jack Williams calls lawn bowling his "competitive outlet." 
</P>
<P>
When Williams, a Naval Academy graduate, retired as a Marine general 19 years 
ago, he looked to sports to occupy his extra time. But when back problems 
forced him to give up tennis and golf 10 years ago, he found lawn bowling could 
satisfy his competitive nature but wasn't as strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
"You get used to competing," Williams said. "Tennis was my game, but I can't 
compete at the national level." 
</P>
<P>
He has done so in lawn bowling, though. Williams is vice president of the 
American Lawn Bowlers Assn., which has about 5,000 members. There is also the 
American Women Lawn Bowlers Assn. with about 2,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Williams traveled to Australia for the Bicentennial Invitational as 
manager (who serves as an alternate) for the U.S. team. He is now a member of 
the committee that selects teams for international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Lawn bowling is an English sport and popular in British Commonwealth countries. 
In Australia, Williams experienced a sport that is different, played on a much 
larger scale, than it is here. In the Commonwealth countries, lawn bowling is 
dominated by young players, usually in their 20s and 30s. Williams said that 
through corporate sponsors, television endorsements and tournament winnings, a 
lawn bowler there can earn about the same as an average American minor league 
baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
But in the United States, the older crowd keeps lawn bowling alive. One 
attraction is that anyone can play it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only competitive sport I know that you can play from 8 years old to 
death," said Robert Marsh, president of the San Diego Lawn Bowling Club. "We 
have men in their late 90s and some that didn't start playing until they were 
70. There's even some who have had a stroke and still play." 
</P>
<P>
Many lawn bowlers are people who have given up other sports for various 
reasons. Marsh said his club has two members who switched from pin bowling. 
Others were not sports participants until they discovered lawn bowling. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego club has 125 active members ranging in age from 28 to 90. Marsh 
said most who practice regularly (three or four times a week) are retired. The 
club has practice games every afternoon except Monday. Bowlers draw names for 
partners, and Marsh said this is helpful to novices who improve by playing with 
more experienced players. 
</P>
<P>
The sport seems relatively easy. There are two sides, made up of one to four 
players. The object is to get as many bowls closer to the white jack than your 
opponent. But there's a catch. The bowl isn't round. It is heavier on one end 
so instead of rolling in a straight line it curves either inward or outward 
depending on how it is rolled. 
</P>
<P>
After each person on each side has bowled, the "end" is completed. After 
scoring, the teams move to the opposite sides of the green and bowl in the 
opposite direction. Usually, 12 to 14 ends are bowled in a game lasting about 
two hours. 
</P>
<P>
One point is given to the side that has a bowl closest to the jack and an 
additional point for each bowl that's closer than the opponent's closest bowl. 
After all the ends have been played, the points are totaled and the team with 
the most wins. 
</P>
<P>
In tournaments, umpires are sometimes called upon to decide measurement 
disagreements. Williams, a national umpire, has sometimes been called out of 
his own game for a measurement, then returned to where he left off. 
</P>
<P>
More experienced players add strategy, directing the bowl around their 
opponent's to get closer to the jack. It's OK to hit the jack but may not be to 
a team's advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is very laid back, but it can be so exasperating," Marsh said. "There 
can be little difference between a good bowl and a bad bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh began bowling after he moved to San Diego from Colorado 10 years ago. He 
needed a hobby, and living near Balboa Park gave him the opportunity to see the 
bowlers in action. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like golf, and the ocean's too cold," Marsh said. "I watched these 
people a couple of days and asked how to get in the club." 
</P>
<P>
He took the three free lessons new lawn bowlers are entitled to, then paid his 
yearly dues of $50, rented a locker for $7 (a year) and bought a set of used 
bowls for $50.

<P>
Three days before Saturday's La Jolla to Del Mar Ironman race, Dee Van Winkle, 
San Diego Outrigger Canoe Club's coach and a member of its defending champion 
men's open team, guaranteed a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We will win," he said, without hesitation, as the San Diego team was 
fine-tuning for outrigger canoeing's long-course season finale and state 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
That was Wednesday, a day when it was cloudy, threatening rain and the ocean 
was a little too rough to ride. All Van Winkle wanted for a perfect repeat 
performance was perfect weather. 
</P>
<P>
It was warm and sunny at La Jolla Shores, Saturday, but to Van Winkle and his 
teammates, it was much gloomier than Wednesday. Roger Malm, San Diego 
Outrigger's No. 1 steersman, came down with the mumps and could not race. 
</P>
<P>
And in the final stretch of the men's open championship, Newport Outrigger 
Canoe Club, a team that had not won a race all season, blew by San Diego to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
Newport's victory proved to be the biggest upset in a day filled with strange 
twists and a series of races that went off about as smooth as the choppy swells 
off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier women's open race, an escort boat the canoes were to follow 
apparently overshot the up-and-back course's turnaround point off Del Mar, 
making the race much longer than planned. To compensate for lost time, 
officials shortened the ensuing men's race by two miles. 
</P>
<P>
Before the final event, a novice race, officials called a conference to discuss 
canceling further racing because of worsening off-shore conditions, then 
decided to shorten the course from four to three miles. 
</P>
<P>
But those troubles were nothing compared to the disappointment experienced by 
San Diego Outrigger's men, who looked to be a sure-shot winner going in and 
were the best hope of any team among three San Diego area clubs. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego led the men's open race through the turnaround point off Del Mar, but 
had trouble steadying the canoe as it headed south toward the finish. Newport 
caught San Diego and the two see-sawed for the lead. With approximately three 
miles left, Newport, which hadn't placed higher than third in an ironman race 
all season, pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Newport's paddlers looked almost stunned that they had beaten San Diego, 
champions of this race three of the past four years, and appeared almost 
hesitant to celebrate when they returned to shore. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hard race," Van Winkle said. "There was a lot of wind and chop. Our 
steersman wasn't able to paddle." 
</P>
<P>
Van Winkle later said that it was he who had replaced Malm as steersman -- the 
paddler positioned at the rear of the boat who must both steer and propel the 
canoe -- and that he was doing it for only the second time in 15 years of 
racing. Lucky Hookano, Newport's coach and steersman, never stopped paddling. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a steersman's game out on this (rough) water," Hookano said. "I had 
difficulties, but everything worked out well. It's hard to tell what happened 
to San Diego. They're a tough team." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his auspicious first name, no one could accuse Hookano of being merely 
lucky. He spent all Friday modifying his canoe's "ama," a bow-shaped pontoon 
appendage that lends balance, but can also aid in performance. Hookano said he 
cut 10 inches off the nose and shaved three inches off the back the fiberglass 
beam, and the adjustment worked. 
</P>
<P>
"With my experience, I know my boat performs best when I cut the ama down to 75 
inches (long)," Hookano said. "It ran very well today." 
</P>
<P>
There were no surprises in the elongated women's open race, won by Offshore I, 
currently the fastest long-course team in the world. But if you ask Deseree 
Snellman, it was still an upset. 
</P>
<P>
Before the race, Offshore I inserted Snellman at the front of the canoe, in a 
position known as "stroker." As stroker, Snellman's primary function was to set 
the paddling pace and cadence. But midway through the race she was stricken 
with a severe cramp. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to do," said Snellman, who had to be carried onto the beach 
after the race. "I was talking to myself a lot, but I was also thinking about 
my teammates and I just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
Snellman got some psychological help from the person sitting behind her, Angie 
Stafford, a chiropractor by trade. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her to relax, breathe and think about other things," Stafford said. "We 
did a little transing, a little hypnosis out there." 
</P>
<P>
Offshore I went on to beat Offshore II by about 200 yards. Both boats were 
entered by Offshore Outrigger Canoe Club of Newport Beach, currently the 
hottest racing club in California. Both its men's and women's open teams set 
records in the Molokai to Oahu Challenge last October. 
</P>
<P>
And had Offshore brought its No. 1 men's team, which had competed in 
Australia's Hamilton Cup series earlier in the week, Van Winkle wouldn't have 
made his prediction and the sting San Diego felt might not have been as severe.

<P>
In the rain forest of the western Amazon, the threat of violent death hangs in 
the air like mist after a tropical rain. It is simply a part of the ecosystem, 
just like the scorpions and snakes cached in the leafy canopy that floats over 
the forest floor like a seamless green circus tent. 
</P>
<P>
People from the Amazon say that the trouble always starts during the burning 
season, a period of two months or so between the two natural climatic seasons 
of the region -- the dry and the wet. By then, the equatorial sun has baked the 
last moisture out of the brush, grass and felled trees, and the people of the 
Amazon -- sometimes Indians and rubber tappers, but most often wealthy ranchers 
and small farmers -- set their world on fire. 
</P>
<P>
The fires clear the clogged fields or freshly deforested land and, in 
disintegrating vegetation, put a few of the nutrients essential for plant 
growth back in the impoverished soil. The burning season is the time before the 
return of the daily downpours that give the rain forest its name. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble arises when one man's fires threaten another man's livelihood. Most 
often, that happens when one of the hundreds of ranchers or speculators who 
have been drawn to the region's cheap land acquires the title to property that 
already is the home of people who have squatted there legally -- sometimes for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Often the new titles are acquired through fraud or coercion. And because the 
most efficient way to reinforce a claim to land in the Amazon is to cut down 
the forest and burn it, the new landlords do just that. Or they loose their 
cattle, which make quick work of the settlers' crops. If that does not work, 
they send out their pistoleiros to burn the families out of their shacks or, if 
they resist, shoot them down. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that has prevented the Amazon river basin and its peoples from 
being totally overrun is its sheer size and daunting character. It is a shallow 
bowl covering 3.6 million square miles, twice the expanse of India. An average 
of eight feet of rain falls here each year, inundating great stretches of 
forest, turning roads into bogs, and providing vast breeding grounds for 
malaria mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
The water drains eastward through a fanlike network of streams and rivers that 
together disgorge 170 billion gallons of water each hour into the Atlantic -- 
eleven times the flow of the Mississippi. Besides producing this riverine sea, 
the deluge also nourishes the largest stretch of rain forest left on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
One of the tens of thousands of plant species in the forest is a tree with a 
smooth trunk that produces a white fluid in a reticulation of tubules beneath 
its bark. Its local name is seringueira; botanists call it Hevea brasiliensis. 
Its common name is the rubber tree. The fluid is thought to protect the tree 
from invasions of boring pests by gumming up the insects' mouth parts. 
</P>
<P>
This same fluid, congealed and properly processed, has remarkable qualities of 
resilience, water resistance and insulation to the flow of electricity -- all 
of which made it one of the most sought after raw materials of the Industrial 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
It was this substance, called latex, that lured the grandfather of Chico Mendes 
and tens of thousands of other men to the Amazon rain forest in two waves over 
the past 120 years. Called seringueiros, these men settled in the forests 
around ports like Xapuri and worked in solitude, fighting to make a life from 
the living forest -- and fighting to free themselves from bosses who saw to it 
that they remained enslaved by their debts. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, as outsiders intent on destroying the forest began to invade the 
Amazon, the seringueiros had to fight once again. This time, they were fighting 
to save their homes, their livelihood and the rain forest around them. 
</P>
<P>
In leading this struggle to preserve the Amazon, Chico Mendes had made a lot of 
trouble for a lot of powerful people. He was to the ranchers of the Amazon what 
Cesar Chavez was to the citrus kings of California, what Lech Walesa was to the 
shipyard managers of Gdansk. The Xapuri Rural Workers Union, which Mendes 
helped found in 1977, regularly sent swarms of demonstrators to thwart the 
ranchers' chain-saw crews. 
</P>
<P>
With his aggressive tactics and fable, plain-talking style, Mendes had then 
attracted the attention of American environmentalists, who invited him to 
Washington and Miami to help them convince the international development banks 
to suspend loans that were allowing Brazil to pave the roads leading into the 
Amazon. Mendes made friends abroad, but he made more enemies at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Amazon was one of the last places where might still made right. In that 
sense, it differed little from the American West of the 19th Century as 
described in 1872 by Mark Twain in "Roughing It": "The very paradise of outlaws 
and desperadoes." 
</P>
<P>
In the Amazon, when you ask people about justica (justice), they simply chuckle 
in a sad kind of way; most of the men in the prison cells are sleeping off a 
drunk, having had several too many slugs of the blazing, strong sugar-cane rum 
called cachaca, which is sold for pennies a glass. In fact, more than 1,000 
people have been murdered in land disputes in rural Brazil since 1980, and 
Amnesty International estimates that fewer than 10 of the killers have been 
convicted and sent to jail. And not one mandante (mastermind) of a murder has 
ever been tried. 
</P>
<P>
In this anarchic atmosphere, the pistoleiros often assume the look of their 
imagined Wild West predecessors, strutting through town with a revolver stuck 
in the waist of tight jeans, boot heels raising red dust. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was that in the latter half of December, the threats against Mendes had 
been replaced with death pronouncements. "Threat" implies that death is only a 
possibility; in Mendes' case, imminent death was a near inevitability. He was 
shot at close range with a .20 gauge shotgun when he stepped out his backdoor. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral of Mendes was held on Christmas Day. Through what the tappers call 
radio cipo -- vine radio, the rain forest version of the grapevine -- word of 
the murder spread quickly. Hundreds of rubber tappers hiked for many hours 
through the forest to attend the wake and funeral. 
</P>
<P>
By Christmas morning, more than a thousand people had crowded around the 
church. The rains had returned in force, drenching the mourners who followed 
the casket to the cemetery on the road leading out of town. Along with the 
hundreds of rubber tappers and small farmers in the procession were dozens of 
Mendes's friends from the other Brazil -- celebrities, politicians and labor 
leaders. Surrounding the crowd were dozens of journalists, many from overseas. 
An international version of vine radio had efficiently disseminated the news of 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
The murder of Mendes might well have been an unremarkable event. He was the 
fifth rural union president murdered in Brazil that year, But over the previous 
three years, Mendes' closer relationships with environmentalists, labor 
organizers, and human-rights advocates from Brazil, the United States and 
Europe had focused increased attention on the struggle of the rubber tappers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, this murder deep in the Amazon rain forest -- where it once took 
three weeks for news to travel down the river -- instantly became an 
international story, making the front page of newspapers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of his murder was further amplified by the disturbing 
environmental anomalies of 1988. The scorching summer in the United States that 
year had motivated politicians and the media for the first time to pay serious 
attention to the greenhouse effect, the theory that billions of tons of gases 
released each year by the burning of fossil fuels and forests are trapping 
solar energy in the atmosphere and disastrously warming the planet. 
</P>
<P>
And just as the heat was breaking records and fires were ravaging Yellowstone 
National Park, the television networks got detailed satellite photographs of 
the Amazon burning season -- thousands of fires burning simultaneously. It 
almost felt as if the heat and smoke generated in the forests were being 
inhaled on the baking streets of Los Angeles, Washington and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the slaying of Mendes. In the months that followed, dozens of 
television crews, photographers and reporters from around the world would take 
the six-hour, four-stop flight from Sao Paulo to Rio Branco, the capital of the 
state of Acre, then bounce for four more hours along the rutted, dusty, partly 
paved road to Xapuri, the river town where Mendes lived. Visitors who stayed 
long enough to walk for a time in the surrounding forest discovered the bounty 
of the ecosystem that Mendes had died defending. It was a place of spectacular 
diversity and vitality. Turn over a log and find 50 species of beetle. Survey 
an acre and find 100 species of butterfly. In the Amazon, one type of rubber 
tree has exploding fruit that flings seeds 20 yards; three-toed sloths harbor 
dozens of species of insects and algae in their matted fur; river porpoises are 
cotton-candy pink. 
</P>
<P>
It was a living pharmacy that scientists had only just begun to explore. A 
fourth of all prescription drugs contain ingredients derived from tropical 
plants -- malaria drugs and anesthetics and antibiotics and more -- and less 
than 1% of the Amazon's plants had been studied. 
</P>
<P>
It became clear to outsiders that the murder was a microcosm of the larger 
crime: the unbridled destruction of the last great reservoir of biological 
diversity on Earth. Just a few centuries ago, the planet had 15 million square 
miles of rain forest, an area five times that of the contiguous United States. 
</P>
<P>
Now three Americas' worth of forest were gone, with just 6.2 million square 
miles left. One-third of the remaining rain forest was in the Amazon basin, and 
over the past decade alone, chain saws and fires had consumed about 10% of it, 
an area twice the size of California. 
</P>
<P>
The aggression against the forest was therefore a many-layered tragedy, causing 
human deaths, killing millions of trees and other organisms and resulting in 
the extinction of several species of plant and animal life each day -- most of 
which had not even been noticed, let alone catalogued or studied. In some ways, 
Mendes and the rubber tappers were simply another endangered species, as much a 
part of the ecosystem as the trees they tapped, the birds in the branches, or 
the ants underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
But the tappers were a species that was fighting back.

NOW FOR THE DIFFICULT PART: SHAMIR'S GOVERNMENT WILL WALK A THIN LINE; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: THE PRIME MINISTER NEEDED ONLY THE RADICAL RIGHT TO WIN, BUT TO GOVERN 
HE NEEDS SUPPORT FROM BOTH LABOR AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the past six years, Israel has been ruled by a two-headed monster known as 
the Government of National Unity. Last week Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
slayed the beast, replacing it with a narrow-based, Likud-led coalition. The 
storybook quality of this victory is flawed, however, by stark political 
reality: Unlike the mythic heroes of old, Shamir the dragon killer is not 
likely to live happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
He may well come to miss the beast. Shamir is a man who, in his three terms as 
prime minister, has elevated inaction to an art form. The unity government, 
which balanced Likud and Labor, hawks and doves, was a perfect vehicle for him 
precisely because it provided an excuse for political and diplomatic paralysis. 
Shamir's new coalition, whatever its flaws, offers no such option. Sooner 
rather than later, the reluctant dragon killer will have to do what he likes 
least -- make hard decisions about peace. Shamir's choices will affect 
U.S.-Israeli relations, the Middle East diplomatic process and the continuing 
influx of Soviet emigres into Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Shamir will be called on to decide what to do about the 
Palestinian issue. On his left, the Bush Administration and the Israeli Labor 
Party -- magically transformed from docile junior partner to a fighting 
opposition -- are pushing hard for Israel to renew its peace initiative and sit 
down for talks with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III expressed U.S. frustration with the peace 
process last week when he gave out the White House phone number and told 
Israeli officials they should call when they were serious about peace. Without 
Israel, Baker said, the United States will end efforts to set up talks. The 
short-term goal of the peaceniks is a conference in Cairo, followed by West 
Bank-Gaza elections and the establishment of Palestinian autonomy. But Shamir 
is well aware that there is a long-range aim as well: Israel's withdrawal from 
most or all of the occupied territories and the eventual establishment of Arab 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
This is something that Shamir, a lifelong hard-liner, opposes. His method has 
been to stonewall, but he is already being pressured by at least half a dozen 
far-right militants in his coalition to annex occupied land. The super-hawks 
want, at minimum, massive Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza -- and no 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the Shamir government is the Likud, a right-center bloc that 
has ruled for most of the last 13 years. This time, however, the more 
left-leaning Labor partners of the National Unity Government have been replaced 
by politicians from the far right, tilting the entire Cabinet in a more hawkish 
direction. In the face of such diametrically different demands, Shamir's 
problem is simple: He must keep American pressure at a manageable level, while 
holding together his narrow coalition. The solution is as tricky: To form a 
government, Shamir needed only the support of the radical right; to govern, he 
requires the cooperation of the Bush Administration and the Labor Party. It is 
difficult to see how he can have both. 
</P>
<P>
This is largely a matter of arithmetic. Shamir's coalition, minus the votes of 
the three small, super-hawkish parties that support him, equals 55 members of 
the Knesset -- six fewer than the majority he needs to sustain his government. 
These parties have made it clear that they will not go along with any serious 
diplomatic initiative -- especially not the kind that the American government 
advocates. Any attempt by Shamir to freeze settlement, or to revive the peace 
process, would almost certainly lead to a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another set of numbers in the equation. The hundreds of thousands 
of expected Soviet immigrants, minus massive American financial support, equal 
economic and social chaos for Israel. This is a real possibility. Past American 
Presidents have not used foreign aid as a lever against Jerusalem, but the Bush 
Administration gives every indication of planning to do so. The United States, 
for example, is holding up a sorely needed, $400-million bank guarantee for 
immigrant resettlement. Money will be forthcoming only if Israel provides 
assurances that it will not be used for housing in the occupied territories. 
The Bush Administration defines the occupied territories as including East 
Jerusalem, although Israel and the U.S. Congress regard the entire city as its 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
This condition is painful, but probably bearable for Shamir. What concerns him 
is the precedent. Should the United States make further financial aid 
conditional on Israeli agreement to attend a peace conference with Palestinian 
delegates it finds unacceptable, or to stop Jewish settlement in the West Bank 
-- and especially East Jerusalem -- he could never go along. But without 
continued American aid it would be all but impossible to absorb the anticipated 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with equally unpleasant alternatives, Shamir has begun sending out 
contradictory signals. In his inaugural address, he spoke in conciliatory terms 
of his commitment to the Camp David accords, and of his willingness to 
negotiate with the Arabs and the Palestinians. Shamir laterdispatched Defense 
Minister Moshe Arens to the West Bank as a sign of solidarity with the Jewish 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
Rhetoric will take Shamir only so far. His inclination is to edge toward the 
center but to do that he will need the cooperation of two 
ex-generals-turned-politician -- Ariel Sharon and Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon is the leader of the militant wing of the Likud. He is also the minister 
of housing in the new government. An ambitious man, he wants to follow the 
aging Shamir as prime minister. To do so, he will have to succeed in his 
primary task -- building tens of thousands of homes for Soviet immigrants. If 
Sharon becomes convinced that this is possible only with U.S. aid -- he could 
become an improbable force for moderation. 
</P>
<P>
The former defense minister is less ideological than is often supposed and he 
has been known to display flexibility when his political interests are 
concerned. With his support, Shamir could conceivably renew the peace process, 
albeit at a cautious pace. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move would probably drive the super-hawks out of the coalition. This is 
where Rabin comes in. Rabin recently launched a challenge to Labor Party leader 
Shimon Peres. If he succeeds -- and his chances seem better than even -- he is 
on record as favoring another Government of National Unity, in which he would 
play a restraining role. 
</P>
<P>
Any other dragon slayer might be dismayed at the prospect of a new unity 
coalition. But for Shamir the Reluctant, under pressure to move in opposite 
directions, it would be more desirable than to climb aboard yet another 
two-headed monster for a slow ride to nowhere.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrats have reason to celebrate this month. They nominated a woman to run 
for California governor and a black to challenge Sen. Jesse A. Helms in North 
Carolina. They watched a front-running anti-abortion candidate for Iowa 
governor go down in flames. Each result gave the party a big opportunity to 
expand its base in November. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Washington, it has been a different story. Gorbymania is gone and a 
sullen Congress is back in town. President George Bush is again jousting with 
Congress over the mushrooming federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats also quietly observed this month an anniversary that few wanted to 
recall: the June, 1989, resignation under fire of House Speaker Jim Wright 
(D-Texas). That downfall, which paralyzed Capitol Hill for much of last year, 
has apparently left few visible wounds for his party. Like so many recent 
miseries for the beleaguered Democrats, however, his departure has brought a 
new pile of problems and self-doubts. 
</P>
<P>
When Wright left town, many Democrats breathed a deep sigh of relief. They no 
longer had to bear the burden of his ethics-tarred reputation, of his cozy 
connections to Texas savings-and-loan swindlers that have forced Democrats to 
share the blame for the S&amp;L mess. Democrats were also grateful they would 
not have to contend with Wright's Lone Ranger leadership style, in which he 
often made impulsive decisions or forced members to make tough choices. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who also acquired his post in 1989, 
Democrats have more-telegenic spokesmen who can speak in sound-bites for TV 
interviews. And their leaders are capable lawmakers willing to roll up their 
sleeves to identify specific problems and tasks and achieve those goals. But it 
has become embarrassingly clear to congressional Democrats that they lack an 
agenda to unify themselves or rally the nation. When they have tried to promote 
some issues, they have either been so split internally that their message was 
blurred or they have been preempted by the President. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: The House and Senate this spring have both passed broad clean-air 
bills, to which many lawmakers have devoted months of work. But Democrats have 
been dogged by divisions, barely papered over, between environmentalists led by 
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and the party's organized-labor wing led 
by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.). The likely result is that Bush will get much 
of the credit when he signs the law later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, on the child-care bill, House and Senate Democrats are working to 
resolve differences between competing versions approved in the past year. One 
reason party leaders have not sounded a fanfare is that their committee leaders 
working on the bill have failed to agree among themselves about the bill's 
rationale. Should child care be a hodgepodge package expanding current federal 
programs, such as Head Start and school aid, emphasizing low-income children? 
Or should it be targeted more toward tax credits for middle-class families 
trying to balance demands of home, school and workplace? Whatever the answer, 
it is not likely to do much for Democrats who wanted to cast their lot with 
"the family." 
</P>

Democrats were gloating last fall that they had Bush and the GOP on the run 
following the Supreme Court decision that approved restrictive state laws on 
abortion. But this year appears to be different: Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), 
the GOP nominee for governor, has lined up with the pro-abortion-rights side. 
And three of the hottest Senate Republican challengers -- Patricia F. Saiki of 
Hawaii, Lynn Martin of Illinois and Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island -- are 
House members who, like the incumbents, favor abortion rights. (Granted, other 
Republicans, such as Clayton Williams, running for Texas governor, either 
oppose abortion or have made sexist comments. But the Democrats' message has 
been blurred by their own anti-abortionists, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Robert 
P. Casey.) 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court last week handed down a decision that has caused more 
Democratic division. In overturning the federal flag-protection law, the court 
reminded Democrats of how the Pledge of Allegiance issue dogged their 1988 
presidential campaign. Both Foley and Mitchell repeated their earlier vow to 
oppose any proposal abridging the Bill of Rights. It remains to be seen whether 
they will prove more skillful than was Michael S. Dukakis in minimizing the 
political costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' biggest frustration has probably been Bush's continuing high 
popularity in public-opinion polls. For that, they have themselves partly to 
blame, simply because they have done so little to present a coherent message 
that describes his shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
In their search for more effective attacks on Bush, some Democrats have 
recently targeted his handling of the S&amp;L disaster. They contend that he 
has become vulnerable both because of his initial failure to propose a 
sufficiently large financial package to resolve the problem and the Justice 
Department's failure to prosecute the wheeler-dealers aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest case we have for 1992 is that we flushed the peace-dividend down 
the S&amp;L toilet, because of the Bush Administration," said a Democratic 
strategist. He contends that the public's short attention span will cause most 
voters to forget about Democrats' misdeeds that fueled the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats are also seeking ways to force Bush to address the 
S&amp;L issue in the coming budget summit. Many Democrats are convinced they 
will be able to force the President to tell the public that the economy has 
gone sour or that he won't be able to keep his no-new-taxes promise -- or both. 
</P>
<P>
The success of this confrontational strategy is uncertain. But an important 
signal that many Democrats have growing doubts is the persistent talk in 
Capitol lobbies that the party's Senate and House control will be in serious 
jeopardy in 1992 because of the combined impact of Bush's reelection, House 
redistricting and the expected large number of retirements. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of fear in the cloakroom," a House Democrat said. In this 
political environment, the Democratic imperative has increasingly become 
individual self-protection. That is generally not a recipe for resurrecting a 
party.

<TEXT>
<P>
Morality and sexual conformity are often mistaken for each other -- even in 
California. This has led to a prurient preoccupation with sexual practices. The 
attitudes that consenting Americans take along with them to bed seem so much 
less significant than the physical gymnastics they engage in once they get 
there. When sexual preference, more than character, is the measure of morality, 
sexual prejudice is born, as love and trust and decency are displaced in favor 
of who does what to whom. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside recently revised its charter. A 1966 city ordinance called for an end 
to racial, religious and ethnic prejudice. Now Riverside would extend this ban 
on bigotry to protect the elderly, the disabled, the rights of women and of 
gays. Outside agitators from Orange County promptly drove into town to 
excoriate homosexuals, but the City Council passed the ordinance anyway, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Other city councils and campuses across the nation have adopted similar 
resolutions. One by one, local communities expand the scope of toleration to 
include homosexual orientation. This brings localities in conflict with our 
nation's military, where sexual discrimination is still practiced against 
homosexuals and the role of women in combat situations. Even ROTC college 
students cannot be gay. Once their sex life is exposed, they are 
less-than-honorably discharged. And women are still forbidden to be fighters, 
even though they're welcome to be clerks. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a genuine moral dilemma facing the California State University 
system, where, for instance, the presence of ROTC on campus is seen as 
unacceptable sexual discrimination. Several campuses -- Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, Northwestern, Pitzer, the University of Wisconsin -- across the 
nation share this moral sentiment and have threatened to ban the ROTC. The list 
of unhappy hosts is growing daily. 
</P>
<P>
It's a far cry from the 1960s, when the federal government challenged local 
practices as bigoted. Now, local institutions consider federal policies 
prejudiced. In this way, smaller communities have taken the initiative, once 
Washington proved too behind the times to act. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's current policy is: "Homosexuality is incompatible with military 
service. The presence of such members adversely affects the ability of the 
Armed Forces to maintain discipline, good order, and morale; to foster mutual 
trust and confidence among the members . . . who frequently must live and work 
under close conditions affording minimal privacy." 
</P>
<P>
If the language seems familiar, consider a recently declassified Navy memo 
written on Christmas Eve, 1941: "The close and intimate conditions of life 
aboard ship, the necessity for the highest possible degree of unity and esprit 
de corps; the requirement of morale -- all these demand that nothing be done 
which may adversely affect the situation. Past experience has shown irrefutably 
that the enlistment of Negroes (other than for mess attendants) leads to 
disruptive and undermining conditions." 
</P>
<P>
If it's not one prejudice, it's another. 
</P>
<P>
The thought behind Pentagon policy on gays suggests a fear of male soldiers 
coming on to one another in the barracks or while in combat. Being sexually 
uncomfortable -- knowing that another may find you attractive -- is not just a 
male problem: Women have gotten used to being regarded as sex objects in this 
way for years, proverbially by sailors in every port. The thought that you 
might seem attractive to someone you're not attracted to is something each of 
us must live with, regardless of our gender. Yet I suspect the deeper thought 
behind the Pentagon's policy is not merely homophobic -- it is testosteronic, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Sexual aggression and sexual orientation are easily confused. When a male 
inmate rapes another man in prison, only the victim is seen as homosexual, not 
the victimizer. He is seen, instead, as having so much male hormone in him that 
he had to do his thing, even if that meant sodomizing a weakling. Now, 
obviously, the army needs soldiers under more control than that of raging 
testosteroniacs, but the thought remains the same -- that it takes a real 
fighting man to kill. And perhaps that's why gays and female combat troops 
won't do. It is the perceived difference between the strong and the weak. Of 
course, this doesn't follow, since gays and women are perfectly capable of 
violence, too. It's just that more often than not, they're not -- or so the 
stereotype would have it. 
</P>
<P>
Erik H. Erikson once said about the Sioux that they swaddled up their male 
children so they couldn't move. This produced episodes of rage, engendering 
qualities required of the braves for the survival of the tribe. Nor is it at 
all surprising that so many armies have raped and killed and looted. They were 
of the proper temperament to do this. But is this necessity for aggressive rage 
really needed by the modern fighting man? 
</P>
<P>
Urbane police chiefs do not feel a need for aggressors on the force -- quite 
the contrary. And so they welcome women and gays. The police see their job as 
averting violence, rather than selectively engaging in it as well. They have 
little need for macho types -- it will only bring the community down upon them. 
The armed forces have traditionally seen their role differently, as exercising 
violence willfully against the other side's similarly oriented soldiers. And as 
long as armies are looking for aggressive warriors, they will continue to be 
prejudiced against gays and women, since they see them as sissies. 
</P>
<P>
Can a nation at risk really defend itself without adopting a violent attitude 
toward war? Until recently, this simply wouldn't have been true. Real soldiers 
really had to want to kill. And so they did on Iwo Jima. But the modern 
instruments of warfare may enable a less-impassioned attitude, making 
destruction more genteel, and more coldblooded, too. Men no longer need be so 
savage to be good soldiers. And the same is true of women. 
</P>
<P>
A well-trained policeman is trained to be assertive, not aggressive, even when 
fighting for his life. If the armed forces were more like the police, there 
would certainly be less need for the testosterone to flow, although not having 
a real lust for killing puts something of a damper on offensive operations. It 
also puts a pall on body counts, rather than containment, on free-fire zones 
rather than restraint. One wonders whether the Vietnam vets would have fewer 
nightmares had they seen themselves as policemen rather than as executioners. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as long as there are wars where the object of the exercise is the death of 
the opposition, it seems that the armed forces will have to continue to recruit 
those who are sufficiently aggressive to be perfectly capable of killing, 
whatever their sexual orientation: Rambo, straight or gay. 
</P>
<P>
Would the risk to national security be worth it, if our armed forces modeled 
themselves after the police rather than the other way around? At least the 
military would then be more representative of the nation they were sworn to 
serve -- men and women, straights and gays.

GENDER FACTOR IN NOVEMBER GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The key to the election effort of Pete Wilson may be the lack of support by 
Republicans for Propositions 118 and 119. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Republicans need Sen. Wilson as governor to veto the 
gerrymandered districts to be engineered by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, is the desire and need of incumbent Republicans to hold onto 
their seats. All incumbents prefer the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan was scheduled to make a commercial and speak on 
behalf of Proposition 119. This did not materialize. Neither did any major 
effort to have notable Republicans, other than Charlton Heston, make and air 
commercials. On the other side, three Hollywood heavyweights made spots against 
Proposition 119 which were constantly on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Did conservative Republicans show displeasure with Wilson as a candidate and 
sit on their hands? Will they do the same next November? 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was reminded often during her primary run that she was a Democrat and 
should not speak like a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
It may appear that Wilson may have the same problem from now until November.

YELTSIN'S CHALLENGE: HOW DISRUPTIVE?; 
</P>
<P>
CHAOS IS ONE POSSIBILITY IF THE SOVIET UNION UNRAVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union is slated to get a new charter by the end of this year that 
will define the "union of sovereign states" President Gorbachev has promised in 
his vision of a recast Soviet federalism. 
</P>
<P>
But events could overtake the effort to draft a power-sharing plan that aims at 
preventing national fragmentation, triggering potentially serious problems for 
the international community. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic states, though they may be compelled to defer reclaiming the 
independence snatched from them 50 years ago, have no intention of renouncing 
their goal. In the populous Ukraine, in Moldavia, in Transcaucasia, rising 
nationalist passions could ignite the bonfires of secessionism. And in the 
enormous Russian Republic itself, President Boris Yeltsin leads demands for 
sovereignty and control over the land's abundant resources. 
</P>
<P>
Though still contained, the centrifugal forces threatening the Soviet Union's 
territorial integrity are gathering strength. No one expects an imminent 
breakup into separate and antagonistic states. But it's also an open question 
whether the country is ready to set its foot firmly on the path toward orderly 
political evolution that Gorbachev envisages. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be no national consensus to preserve the Soviet state in its 
present form, and an effective center of command to mobilize such a consensus 
no longer exists. The Communist Party, long the one unifying element in the 
multinational, multilingual country, has suffered a near-total collapse of 
moral authority. The central government, meanwhile, is despised for its chronic 
economic mismanagement. The breakdown in institutional authority is matched by 
a decline in personal authority. Gorbachev, the reformer, remains a far more 
popular figure abroad than he is at home, where he is blamed for falling living 
standards, rising crime and the ineffectiveness of halfhearted economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Into this vacuum has leapt Boris Yeltsin, suddenly the most prominent 
politician inside Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, popularly elected and thus bearing a political legitimacy that 
Gorbachev lacks, is ready to challenge the national president on virtually 
every issue. Yeltsin speaks for a populist, nationalist mood that must be taken 
seriously. The Russia he now presides over covers three-fourths of the Soviet 
Union's land mass, contains half the country's population and produces most of 
its oil -- which, Yeltsin complains, Russia has been forced to sell to other 
republics at far less than fair market prices. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and other Russian nationalists say things must change. They aren't 
talking about separatism and independence -- yet -- but they are talking about 
a sovereignty that would give Russian laws precedence over Soviet laws, and 
that would leave the republic free to make treaties and fix its own terms of 
trade with other republics. 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing for Gorbachev to tighten the economic screws to force the Baltic 
states back into line. Russia is a far different matter -- too big to be 
bullied, its president much too popular to be easily discredited. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev talks about diffusing power under his new federal plan. But if the 
Russian Parliament has its way, the approach to power sharing will be radically 
reversed. It won't be the central government that decides what powers to 
delegate to the republics; it will be the republics that will choose what 
responsibilities to grant to the once all-powerful center. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, the Soviet state that Lenin and Stalin created will in effect 
have ceased to exist.

<TEXT>
<P>
As a long-time Democrat, I want to express appreciation to Pete Wilson for 
opening up the fall gubernatorial campaign on a positive note. 
</P>
<P>
His new television ad shows how, as senator, he worked constructively with 
then-Mayor Feinstein to solve problems in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is reported that Wilson starts out with a substantial funding 
advantage, it is gratifying that he would open the campaign by using some of it 
to highlight Feinstein's skill in working with opposition legislators to 
achieve goals, and her graciousness ("You're wonderful!") in dealing with 
friend and foe alike. 
</P>
<P>
As governor she will be able to work with state legislators of both parties 
and, starting in 1991, Gov. Feinstein's good rapport with Sen. Wilson will 
benefit all Californians.

LOW VOTER TURNOUT FOR PRIMARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I voted June 5th, but 75% of Californians apparently did not. According to your 
front-page article, "The Anti-Electorate: 3 of 4 Californians Stayed Home" 
(June 9), sending the message: "We don't care." 
</P>
<P>
We do care, however, we feel that we do not have an effect on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Put an option on the ballot! Allow the voter to tell each party that none of 
the candidates are acceptable! Simply not voting, or voting for one of several 
bad choices, is not democracy in action, it's frustration with the system. When 
was the last time that a write-in candidate was successful? There have been 
none that I know of for President or major office. 
</P>
<P>
Provide a block in each category, i.e., state governor, which says that "No 
Candidate Is Acceptable." Then require the party to get a qualified candidate. 
Note that most governmental agencies can function without a key person. 
</P>
<P>
People might be more inclined to vote if they truly believed their vote meant 
something, rather than making a choice between the lesser of two evils.

INSIDER TRADING DESERVES NO LEGAL CONDEMNATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE FEIN and EDWIN MEESE III, Bruce Fein is a constitutional lawyer in 
Washington. Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III is a distinguished fellow of 
the Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hyper-zealous enforcement of so-called insider trading laws by the 
Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission justify a 
twist on the words of Winston Churchill: Never have so many expended so much 
effort for so little. Insider trading prohibitions in connection with the 
commercial purchase or sale of securities is akin to requiring war to be fought 
by Queensbury Rules. They should be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits a corporate official or associate 
from purchasing or selling a security while possessing material, nonpublic 
information regarding the financial prospects of his or another company -- 
e.g., a large oil or gas discovery or an impending takeover bid. That 
prohibition is enforced by steep criminal penalties and daunting financial 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
The insider trading prohibition has helped the government slay such Wall Street 
giants as Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and Michael Milken. It is relentlessly 
enforced by the SEC and the Justice Department. For more than a decade, both 
have hectored foreign nations to make insider trading a crime and have 
negotiated mutual assistance agreements to obtain international cooperation to 
enforce insider trading prohibitions. 
</P>
<P>
This frenzy of law enforcement exertions would lead a layman to conclude that 
insider trading is a community menace rivaled only by international 
drug-trafficking cartels. 
</P>
<P>
But insider trading is commercially innocuous and deserves no legal 
condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
In ordinary commercial transactions, neither the purchaser nor the seller is 
required to disclose nonpublic information that ensures his bargain will be 
exceptionally rewarding. Suppose an art maven approaches a museum to purchase a 
Van Gogh portrait with a bid of $50 million. The would-be buyer declines to 
inform the museum that if the sale is consummated, a Japanese billionaire has 
agreed to then purchase the portrait from him for $82 million. The sale is 
made, the buyer immediately resells to the billionaire for a $32-million 
profit, and the law does not condemn the buyer for failing to inform the museum 
that a higher price could have been commanded by a direct sale to the Japanese 
Croesus. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose a commercial aerospace company in Southern California signs a nonpublic 
contract to build hundreds of fighter aircraft for a foreign country. The 
contract will necessitate the immediate purchase of substantial industrial land 
to expand manufacturing capacity. The company purchases the land it needs at a 
price far less than would have been demanded if the seller had known of the 
fighter aircraft contract and thus the buyer's urgent need to purchase the 
property. Despite the company's failure to disclose, the law of commercial land 
transactions is undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
In these hypotheticals, the sellers were not misled, nor did they sell at a 
price they believed was unfair. Commercial law offers no redress to the seller 
simply because a more lucrative return might have been negotiated if he had 
known all facts known to the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
So why should a corporate insider be legally or morally censurable for 
purchasing a security at a price satisfactory to the seller simply because he 
knows that within less than a month his company will bid for that security at a 
substantially higher price? The seller was neither misled nor coerced into a 
sale. So what is the grievance? 
</P>
<P>
Stockholders may think the corporate official was unduly enriched in the 
transaction. But if they are offended by such profits, stockholders can ban 
insider trading by corporate officials in articles of corporation or corporate 
bylaws. The result, however, would cause corporate officers to demand higher 
salaries or other benefits that would reduce corporate and shareholder wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Investors did not resist the allures of Wall Street before the initiation of 
insider trading prohibitions in 1934. Further, investors buy and sell stocks 
based on expectations of profit to them, not on whether corporate officials are 
profiting even more by trading on inside information. 
</P>
<P>
Insider trading laws were enacted because politicians needed a scapegoat for 
the 1929 stock market crash and the ensuing economic depression. But to 
criminalize business practices in securities markets that are innocent in all 
other lines of commerce is morally perverse and an inexcusable waste of 
law-enforcement resources when so much genuine crime escapes punishment.

Thirty years have passed since the renewal of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. 
It's time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
The raison d'etre of the treaty -- that Japan would provide the front line of 
defense for the American-led postwar order in Asia against expanding communism 
-- has collapsed. The treaty is gradually losing its significance and will 
eventually become totally obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Although it would be hasty, even careless, at this time to call for the 
abolition of the pact, it should be dramatically changed from a one-sided 
arrangement that supports only U.S. strategic objectives to one that enables 
Japan to provide for its own defense and pursue its own interests. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the illusory protection of Japan by the U.S. nuclear umbrella, Japan 
cannot tactically defend itself under the terms of the treaty, as even Germany 
can do as a member of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Only one division of the U.S. forces stationed in Japan is devoted to the 
defense of Japanese territory. The rest are assigned to a strategic mission 
that encompasses the defense of an area stretching west of Hawaii all the way 
to Cape Town, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Although we have spent much money revamping our maritime self-defense force, it 
constitutes just a single division of the American 7th Fleet. It functions only 
to monitor submarines in the seas around Japan, not as a means of defending 
Japanese territory. The situation is similar with respect to ground forces. The 
northernmost island of the Japanese archipelago, Hokkaido, is the most likely 
place for an invasion. Yet there is not a single American soldier stationed 
there. 
</P>
<P>
From the Japanese standpoint, one is obliged to ask two questions: Aside from 
the U.S. strategic agenda, why are American forces stationed in Japan if not 
for the defense of Japan? And, if they are not defending Japan, why are we 
constantly being pressured by the United States to pay more for them? 
</P>
<P>
Answers to the first question can readily be found in Pentagon planning 
documents, in which the Soviet Union is listed as enemy No. 1, China as enemy 
No. 2 and Japan as enemy No. 3. Recently, a commander of the U.S. Marine Corps 
testified before Congress that American troops are in Japan to ensure that we 
cannot enhance our military capabilities and once again become a major military 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Yet we are expected to foot the bill so America will, supposedly, save us from 
ourselves. Japan is shouldering 40% of the expenses of maintaining American 
forces stationed here. This amounts to about 8 million yen per soldier, or the 
average annual pay of a typical salaryman (corporate employee). 
</P>
<P>
Talk of Japan's enjoying a free ride of military protection at the expense of 
the 
</P>
<P>
U.S. taxpayer is thus obviously unfounded. As it is, the Japanese are 
prohibited from using either their brains or their hands to defend their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
It is time for this to change. 
</P>
<P>
While staying well within the constraints of the Japanese Constitution, its cap 
(1%-of-gross national product) on military spending and its restriction against 
offensive weapons, Japan can reorganize its forces under the terms of the 
security treaty so that it is capable of tactically and more effectively 
defending its territory ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
We could defend our coastlines with high-speed cruisers that possess 
ship-to-air missiles. We must be able to close Japan's three most vital sea 
straits in the event of foreign attack. We need our own jet fighter, the FSX. 
We can dispense with the ridiculously out-of-place tank defense of an island 
nation that is mainly mountainous and forested. 
</P>
<P>
We should seek the return of at least one of the three large U.S. air bases on 
the outskirts of Tokyo. The Yakota Air Base in particular is not used to any 
great extent, yet the air-control situation around Tokyo is dangerous because 
of very heavy congestion at both Narita and Haneda airports. 
</P>
<P>
I do not oppose cooperation with the United States and even the maintenance of 
American forces on Japanese soil. But to the extent that the strategic mission 
of U.S. forces is beyond direct Japanese interests, they should not be based 
here rent-free. To the extent that they help defend Japan, our own forces must 
be capable of defending the U.S. bases. 
</P>
<P>
By reconfiguring our forces, we can improve Japan's defense fourfold, while 
remaining within the 1% cap on military spending. It would not go unnoticed, of 
course, that -- because of the size of Japan's GNP -- this would make us the 
nation with the third-largest expenditures for defense, after the Soviet Union 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of the size of Japanese military spending, however, should not 
be exaggerated. Civilization is entering a new era where economic and 
technological might outweighs the importance of military power. Japan is the 
nation most strongly positioned to play a major role, especially with its mass 
production capabilities in semiconductors. Indeed, as a 1986 Pentagon report 
made alarmingly clear, the weaponry upon which America's world strategy relies 
already depends fundamentally on Japanese mass-production of high-quality 
semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
It is precisely this vital technological role that gives Japan the leverage to 
chart an independent course in which it designs its own contribution to the 
world order. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the United States will not allow the sale of reconnaissance 
satellites to Japan. Yet, without our own satellites, how can we obtain the 
information that will allow us to independently and accurately assess not only 
military threats, but also ecological and development problems that we are 
called upon to help alleviate? 
</P>
<P>
Under present arrangements, if a developing country wants aid from Japan, it 
must first go to Washington for approval, and then Washington calls on us. 
Japan is not willing to continue such silly efforts. Our money just disappears 
down a hole with no measurable effect. 
</P>
<P>
It is time for Japan to consider the possibility of playing our microchip card 
in order to bring the United States to its senses rather than it arrogantly and 
arbitrarily constraining our capacity for initiative in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's technological prowess, however, is not only a negative lever. It is 
also a positive asset. In fact, it is the basis for the global ideal of what I 
call "the dynamics of Japanese aid," which can be Japan's chief contribution to 
the new international order. 
</P>
<P>
Information and resource-efficient technologies are central to modernizing the 
developing world. More than anything else, those countries need an information 
and renewable-energy infrastructure if they are not going to be left out of the 
21st Century. In all these areas -- from consumer electronics, such as VCRs and 
TVs, to the most sophisticated microchip, optical fibers and solar batteries -- 
Japan has the most advanced technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Since all these technologies were developed commercially rather than for 
military purposes, they are both cost-efficient and non-threatening. Other 
countries may be able to provide the infrastructure of the past, such as 
highways, railroads and huge power stations, but only Japan can mass produce 
the communications and energy infrastructure of the new age at a low cost. 
</P>
<P>
"The dynamics of Japanese aid" could make an even more powerful contribution to 
countries with a higher level of skills and education, such as Hungary or 
Czechoslovakia. If a concerted multilateral effort supported this idea of 
Japanese-style aid, we could turn those two countries around within five years. 
And, no doubt, Great Britain and France would welcome our efforts, since they 
would provide a counterweight to German economic domination of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years after the signing of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which 
subordinated Japan to the strategic objectives of the United States, Japan is 
capable of going its own way. It is capable of devising a global strategy and 
should do so. A Japan that can say no to U.S. orders is a Japan that has 
recovered its full sovereignty, just like any other nation.

By STEVEN BRODY, president of the Republican Law Students Assn. of Western 
State University College of Law in Fullerton, favors a constitutional amendment 
banning flag burning. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are very few things left in the country that are considered sacred. Some 
things just need to be preserved. You're brought up to believe in God and 
country, and I think the best symbol of our nation is the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
There can't be any other way to go except a constitutional amendment. Leaving 
it up to the state legislatures, you're going to have the ACLU behind it, or 
the real liberal legislators -- people like Ted Kennedy, who are saying, "I 
don't personally believe in flag burning, but it's freedom of expression." 
</P>
<P>
I don't see what flag burning proves. It's just something that really grips 
you. We had to endure that when we had hostages in Iran. But to see it in our 
own back yard, and to have Americans burning the flag, it really turns my 
stomach. That's one thing that I would have thought that our country could 
stand behind and stand up and say, "No we can't have this, something's got to 
be done about it, we need a constitutional amendment."

About 1,000 gay rights demonstrators staged a noisy but generally peaceful 
protest outside Holy Cross Cathedral in Boston as 11 priests were ordained 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
Church spokesman John Walsh said the ceremonies, conducted by Cardinal Bernard 
Law, proceeded without interruption. A coalition of gay-rights groups organized 
the demonstration to oppose "Cardinal Law's interference in public policy, as 
well as his opposition to AIDS education," a statement said. Police said one 
person, a lone counterdemonstrator, was arrested.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of preschool children and eight University of Pennsylvania veterinary 
students were exposed to lambs that had been injected with a potentially fatal 
virus, but school officials said the risk of anyone getting ill was extremely 
remote. Nevertheless, the university is recommending that a score of students 
and staff be tested for the virus as a precaution and has offered blood tests 
to about 100 children who came in contact with the lambs. 
</P>
<P>
The lambs had been inoculated with the virus, which can cause a fatal form of 
leukemia. It can take 10 to 30 years for the virus to develop in humans. A 
university spokesman in Philadelphia said a breach in laboratory regulations by 
a senior researcher exposed the students, staff and the children who petted the 
lambs during a field trip last month to Penn's New Bolton Center near Kennett 
Square, Pa.

<P>
More than two-thirds of Americans favor amending the U.S. Constitution to 
outlaw flag desecration, according to a Gallup Poll conducted for Newsweek 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the survey reflected a growing understanding of the Supreme 
Court's finding that flag-burning is a protected form of free speech. Although 
68% said they wanted the amendment, the poll also found 37% in agreement with 
the court, compared to 28% who backed a similar ruling issued a year ago. In 
addition, 73% said that a candidate's position on flag-burning was important to 
them in an election for governor, Congress or a state legislature.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has been ordered to continue 
releasing water into four Mono Lake streams that have suffered damage from 
diversions into the city's aqueduct. El Dorado County Superior Court Judge 
Terrence Finney ruled on behalf of the National Audubon Society and Mono Lake 
Committee, which had said Los Angeles' diversions through the years have 
eliminated fisheries and streamside flora. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was required by earlier rulings to give up part of its water supply 
to restore the streams and Mono Lake. But the new order details the minimum 
flows Los Angeles must maintain down Parker, Walker, Lee Vining and Rush 
creeks. A hearing to set the minimum water level of Mono Lake also is set to 
begin June 19.

COVER STORY: TIME FOR SOME REAL-LIFE TV DADS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joe Rhodes 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took me 35 years to figure this out, but I finally understand why parents 
have always worried about their kids watching too much television. It's not the 
violence or the sex or even the fear that they'll try to comb their hair like 
Ted Koppel. No, it's something much scarier than that. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are afraid that their kids will start comparing them to the parents on 
TV. Particularly, the fathers. Go on, admit it. Wouldn't you rather have been 
raised by a TV dad? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, TV dads never went to work, at least not in the '50s and early 
'60s. And I'm not just talking about Ozzie Nelson here. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Young, Jim Anderson on "Father Knows Best," was supposed to be an 
insurance salesman, but he was home every night before supper. And Carl Betz, 
from "The Donna Reed Show," was Dr. Alex Stone, a pediatrician whose phone 
never rang after sunset. What, babies never had ear infections in Hilldale? 
</P>
<P>
And what about Fred MacMurray on "My Three Sons"? Steve Douglas was an aviation 
engineer who spent all his time smoking a pipe and reading the newspaper while 
Bub or Uncle Charley did the dishes and scrubbed the floors. 
</P>
<P>
Because they had plenty of free time, TV dads were always good at giving 
advice, solving problems and explaining the meaning of life. 
</P>
<P>
TV dads hardly ever yelled, even when their kids did something really stupid 
like putting the dog in the washing machine. You never once heard Ward Cleaver 
say to the Beaver, "Stay right there, you little punk. I'm going to get my 
belt!" 
</P>
<P>
Instead he said things like (and this is an actual piece of "Leave It to 
Beaver" dialogue): "I don't care what kind of trouble you may get into in life, 
you don't ever need to be afraid to come to your parents and tell them." 
</P>
<P>
Man, real-life fathers never said stuff like that! But TV dads did all the 
time. Remember on "The Andy Griffith Show" when Opie killed a bird with his 
slingshot? His father, Sheriff Andy Taylor, didn't chase him or beat him or 
lock him up in jail. Andy Taylor, the quintessential TV dad, had a 
heart-to-heart talk with his son. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to give you a whipping," Andy said, opening the bedroom window. 
"Do you hear that? That's them young birds chirping for their mama that's not 
coming back. You just listen to that awhile." 
</P>
<P>
There used to be plenty of other ways to tell TV dads from the real ones. Real 
dads wore short-sleeved dress shirts with sweat stains under the arms. TV dads 
-- everyone from Rob Petrie to Clifford Huxtable -- wore sweaters. Certainly, 
there were exceptions. Jed Clampett and Herman Munster, fashion daredevils that 
they were, went with jackets, regardless of the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
But that's beside the point, which is that shows about fatherhood always have 
been an integral part of television programming, turning up even more 
frequently than professional wrestling. You don't believe me? Look at these 
titles from network shows: 
</P>
<P>
"Father Knows Best." "Professional Father." "Bachelor Father." "Make Room for 
Daddy." "Father of the Bride." "The Feather and Father Gang." "The Courtship of 
Eddie's Father." "Wait Till Your Father Gets Home." "My Two Dads." "Major Dad." 
"The Father Dowling Mysteries." (No, wait. Forget about that last one.) 
</P>
<P>
And I haven't even mentioned, "Zorro and Son," or for that matter, the most 
influential TV dad of them all. 
</P>
<P>
Archie Bunker. 
</P>
<P>
He called people names. He hated his job. He yelled at his wife and didn't 
understand his only child. He had gas. You could look at Archie Bunker and, 
theoretically, decide that your own old man might not be so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
These days, there are plenty of TV dads that you'd just as soon avoid. Al Bundy 
and Homer Simpson leap immediately to mind. And look at Tony Danza's daughter 
on "Who's the Boss?" Her dad is a maid. How must that be? 
</P>
<P>
Let's not even start with all these mutant makeshift families springing up, 
orphans being raised by millionaires, single guys stuck with a daughter that 
one of them might have fathered. Ward Cleaver wouldn't know where to begin. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone went off the deep end. The '80s did give us some stable TV 
dads. There was Steven Keaton of "Family Ties" and, of course, there's "The 
Cosby Show." But, sweater or not, "Cosby's" Cliff Huxtable is a long way from 
Ozzie Nelson. Ozzie never would have said to Ricky what Cliff once said to his 
son, Theo: "I brought you into this world and I can take you out of it." 
</P>
<P>
So take heart, real-life dads. Maybe you've still got a chance.

THE SONS ALSO RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As one of television's most famous sons, David Nelson is well aware of his 
white-bread image honed during 14 seasons on "The Adventures of Ozzie and 
Harriet," a reputation that typecast him in "David Nelson" roles for years. 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson gave up a chance to give straight-arrow Dave a slight edge when 
Ozzie Nelson, the show's director, was looking for some stage business for his 
oldest son to do in a scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I was about 20 and because I smoked at the time, he said, 'Why don't you just 
go over and light a cigarette,' " recalls Nelson. "I said, 'You know, Dad, I 
don't think I could do that.' I tried, but it was so out of character for David 
Nelson -- and yet I did smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Although he and brother Rick were unique as television offspring -- real-life 
sons playing themselves with their real-life parents each week -- David Nelson 
has a lot in common with fellow former TV sons such as Jerry Mathers (The Beav 
on "Leave It to Beaver"). 
</P>
<P>
They played good boys -- the kind of guys TV daughters had no qualms about 
taking home to mom and dad. 
</P>
<P>
In an era of renegade TV sons such as Bud Bundy and Bart Simpson, David Nelson 
and Beaver Cleaver seem too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Mathers says, "Leave It to Beaver" then -- and even "The Simpsons" now 
-- was not meant to be a documentary. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say you can't live like that in real life," he says. "We were 
doing situation comedies, so it was supposed to be bigger than life. But the 
things that happened to the Beaver were things that really did happen to kids. 
They were taken from real life." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he concedes with a laugh, when Beaver got in trouble, TV pop Ward merely 
took the boy into the Cleaver library for a stern but loving talk; in real 
life, Mathers said, the Beav would have "gotten his bottom tanned."

The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (Cinemax Sunday at 4:30 p.m.): Maggie Smith has 
one of her best screen roles in this 1969 film, from the Muriel Spark novel, as 
a charismatic teacher whose ideas and influence are at once idealistic and 
dangerous. (2:00) 
</P>
<P>
Scarface (1932, AMC Sunday at 6:30 p.m., again at 1 a.m.): This is the raw, 
brutal 1932 Howard Hawks original in which Paul Muni plays a gangster based on 
Al Capone. (1:45) 
</P>
<P>
Cartouche (TNT Sunday at 7 p.m.): This all-but-forgotten 1964 release is a 
sophisticated, satirical swashbuckler from Philippe De Broca starring Jean-Paul 
Belmondo, who as the bandit Cartouche, a cross between Robin Hood and Cyrano, 
careens across the beautiful countryside of 18th-Century France. With Claudia 
Cardinale. (2:30) 
</P>
<P>
Dark Eyes (Bravo Monday at 8 p.m.): Marcello Mastroianni's weak-willed,

We are avid "Knots Landing" fans who have been watching for four years now. We 
were extremely disappointed with this year's anticlimactic season finale. The 
show's writers have left us with no reason to watch the season opener this 
fall.

I would like to applaud Judge Wapner on his decision handed down for the 
defendant during the May 23 airing of "People's Court." 
</P>
<P>
He very astutely judged that the young girl who kicked her date's car was 
understandably reacting in anger to what sounded to me like a case of sexual 
assault. The young man obviously thought that with no witnesses, she would not 
be able to defend her action "in court," but the judge saw through his 
arrogance. I thought Wapner's comments were sensitive and thoughtful. The young 
man probably deserved far worse than a kick in the car.

<P>
The Father Clements Story (NBC Sunday at 7 p.m.) is a substantial fact-based 
1987 drama about a black priest, played well by Louis Gossett Jr., who adopts a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
You Only Live Twice (ABC Sunday at 8:30 p.m.) is a fast, funny, 1967 no-holds 
barred piece of outrageous nonsense. Sean Connery, as James Bond, goes to Japan 
to find out who's hijacking space craft in order to provoke war between the 
United States and Russia. The villian is Donald Pleasance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1988 TV movie Red River (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) doesn't equal the 
1948 Howard Hawks original, it's well made and acted. James Arness has John 
Wayne's role as a trail boss and Bruce Boxleitner has the sensitive Montgomery 
Clift part. 
</P>
<P>
Appearances (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie about a couple struggling 
to save their family business. Scott Paulin and Wendy Phillips star. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 Wallenberg: A Hero's Story (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m., completed 
Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is one of the better depictions of relating to the Nazi 
slaughter, with Richard Chamberlain in a good performance as the unlikely 
Swedish diplomat who effected the rescue of more than 120,000 Hungarian Jews as 
the war was drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the crass way in which The Flamingo Kid (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) was 
made, this 1984 film is a pretty funny movie about values and choices in which 
Matt Dillon is sweetly bewildered and very effective as a teen-ager. There's a 
spectacularly good performance from Richard Crenna as the smooth-talking, 
fatherly gin-rummy king at a Long Island beach club where Dillon has a summer 
job, circa 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Stranger in My Bed (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a routine 1986 fact-based drama 
about an amnesiac, played by Lindsay Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Prince made his 1984 film debut in the lurid, overwrought Purple Rain (Channel 
13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again Saturday at 5 p.m.), a semi-autobiographical 
account of a black-Italian Minneapolis rock musician. 
</P>
<P>
Elia Kazan's memorable 1952 Viva Zapata! (Channel 5 Thursday at 7:30 p.m.) 
stars Marlon Brando as the Mexican revolutionary; also featured are Jean Peters 
and Anthony Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
Siesta (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is one of those monumentally bad movies, 
a 1987 work of hot, awful artiness in which Ellen Barkin plays a daredevil sky 
diver in the grips of an obsessive love. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Altman's 1976 Buffalo Bill and the Indians (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) 
is an alternately pretentious and tedious parable on the condescending, 
exploitative and treacherous treatment of Native Americans by whites, featuring 
a demythologized Buffalo Bill (Paul Newman) and pulp writer Ned Buntline (Burt 
Lancaster, deftly ironic). 
</P>
<P>
The entertaining 1981 Outland (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is quite literally 
"High Noon" in outer space with a splendid Sean Connery as an intergalactic 
marshal. 
</P>
<P>
The late Michael Powell and the late Emeric Pressburger's 1947 lush color film 
of Rumer Godden's Black Narcissus (Channel 28 Saturday at 10:40 p.m.) verges on 
the outrageous in its evocation of incipient corruption and sexual hysteria as 
a group of nuns, headed by Deborah Kerr, attempts to turn an ancient Indian 
harem, pitched on an incredibly high cliff, into a convent.

power struggles inside one of New York's organized-crime families during the 
1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Woods' best-selling novel "Grass Roots" served as the inspiration for a 
four-hour political thriller that NBC is now casting. The story follows Will 
Lee, a well-respected lawyer and politician about to undertake a campaign for a 
seat in the U.S. Senate. His life begins to unravel when he is forced to defend

THE CASE FOR O.C.; 
</P>
<P>
BEHIND THE ORANGE CURTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker's two mystery novels, Laguna Heat 
and Little Saigon, take place in Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE AGE of 4, I had the good sense to pack my family out of Los Angeles and 
move south to Orange County. My dad grumbled and my mother was shocked, but my 
brother and sister were all for it. After all, we were the future, weren't we? 
That was 32 years ago, and I haven't looked back. since. Even if I had, not 
much would have been visible, because the L.A. smog is so bad you need an LAPD 
battering ram to get through it. 
</P>
<P>
Live in Los Angeles? You've got to be kidding. Let's compare the basics. 
</P>
<P>
THE PEOPLE: There's one fundamental difference between L.A. people and Orange 
Countians. L.A. people all want to be someone else. Look at them, and, as Jim 
Harrison has written, "see the folly whirling in their eyes." The waiters all 
want to be novelists; the novelists all want to be screenwriters; the 
screenwriters all want to direct; the directors all want to produce; the 
producers all want to keep the other guys relegated to net participation and 
guild minimums. Don't believe me? Go to a Laker game. Pat Riley wants to be 
Michael Douglas. Jack Nicholson wants to be Magic Johnson. Dyan Cannon wants to 
be in high school again, mesmerizing bleachers full of male adolescents with 
crack pompon work and bouncy wiggles. 
</P>
<P>
Now take Orange Countians. We know who we are. The blandly handsome, heavily 
mortgaged, marathon-running, aerospace department manager, driving to work in 
his Taurus, does not entertain dreams of movie making. He has weapons to build, 
a country to defend, a family to provide for. Or take the blond mall rat, age 
16, with her squeaky voice and her eyes aflame with consumer fever. She doesn't 
secretly wish to be Michelle Pfeiffer. She has actually never heard of Michelle 
Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
The loose-jawed surf dude in Huntington Beach entertains not a single thought 
besides the next south swell, south being to his left, he's pretty sure, if 
he's facing the gnardical tubes of the Pacific, which he usually is. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLACE: Be honest, now. Would you rather spend your day in Laguna Beach or 
at the La Brea Tar Pits? Would you rather drive Pacific Coast Highway with the 
top down and your radio blasting or sit on Interstate 10 and watch the Boyle 
Avenue exit inch by while you wonder which of these other gridlocked sociopaths 
is going to pop off a couple .44 magnum rounds at you? Would you rather stroll 
amid the abject hideousness of Venice Beach (even the beaches want to be 
somewhere else!) or settle down with a dry martini in a bar with a view of 
Newport Harbor, the Pacific, Catalina Island, and no waiters named Darrel who 
want to act? Would you rather sit in a quiet patio in the Modjeska Canyon 
wildlife sanctuary and watch the birds come and go or sit in the lounge of the 
Tom Bradley International Terminal, eat a stale $2.95 croissant and watch the 
jets lumber through the swelling apocalyptic vapors that pass for air? 
</P>
<P>
I'm trying to be fair here. 
</P>
<P>
THE ATTITUDE: People in L.A. think they're ahead of Orange Countians in all 
things hip and wonderful. They glow with condescension, with an arrogance that 
doesn't just suggest superiority but proclaims it. A friend from L.A., visiting 
me when I lived on Balboa Island (ever notice how people come to Orange County 
to get out of L.A., but never the other way around?), remarked that he was 
surprised to see such a "progressive" shampoo in my shower. It mattered to him 
where my shampoo registered on the hipness scale. We walked the campus at UC 
Irvine, where I was a student, and his Bruin nose, high in the air, sniffed at 
the "sterility" it sensed there. Later, we took my tiny sailboat (a two-man 
Sears Whirlwind) into Newport Harbor, where my friend gestured at the passing 
boats and remarked that the Marina del Rey yachts were far more "seaworthy than 
gaudy, like these things." Orange Countians have more sense than to fall for 
most of the embarrassing trends that flourish in L.A. For instance, nouvelle 
cuisine was a conspicuous and stunning flop in Orange County restaurants. For 
instance, attractive young women in Orange County have the guts and imagination 
to wear something other than Wayfarers and black leather. For instance, no man 
in Orange County, even in the sartorial nightmare of the early 1970s, ever wore 
a pair of goddamned clogs. Those were relegated to L.A., in a parade of 
unrepentant high-silliness from which the city has yet to recover. 
</P>
<P>
THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSIONS: Los Angeles has the dirtiest air in the nation; Orange 
County has no smog at all. Los Angeles traffic is rivaled only by that of 
Manhattan; Orange County's freeways and surface streets bustle along at 
over-the-speed-limit velocity 24 hours a day. Los Angeles is ugly. Orange 
County is beautiful. People in Los Angeles all want to be someone else because 
they're miserable; people in Orange County are content to be who they are 
because they're happy. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear. People in L.A. can't face reality. 
</P>
<P>
We can.

FROM THE BELLY OF THE BEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HARVEY, Steve Harvey writes The Times' Only in L.A. column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I DON'T LOVE L.A., OK? Century Boulevard. I don't love it. Victory Boulevard. I 
don't love it. Sixth Street. I don't love it. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure anyone here really loves L.A. 
</P>
<P>
As for the attitude of outsiders, there's no doubt. I was talking to the owner 
of a gift shop in Virginia City, Mont., and when she found out I was from L.A., 
she reminisced about attending the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," she said, still somewhat amazed. "I'd been warned about people in 
L.A. But they weren't bad at all! Some of them were real nice." 
</P>
<P>
I thanked her on behalf of my neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Even at home, we're used to hearing L.A. rapped, often by infiltrators from the 
Big Apple. There's even a group here called DENY -- Disgruntled Ex-New Yorkers. 
I think part of their animosity toward L.A. is guilt over enjoying the pleasant 
weather here. (For outsiders, substitute "jealousy" for "guilt.") 
</P>
<P>
What was it Bay Area columnist Herb Caen once said? "Knock San Francisco to a 
San Franciscan and you're starting a fight; knock L.A. to an Angeleno and 
you're starting a conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Rapping L.A. is part of the fun of being an Angeleno. L.A. is an antihero among 
cities. We're not so insecure that we can't admit our faults and joke over the 
grimmer aspects. 
</P>
<P>
An Encino company has published "The Official Earthquake Preparedness Guide," 
every page of which says, simply, "Get the hell out of California." 
</P>
<P>
I just received a fake press release from an individual who drew up "The 
Official Southern California Freeway Schedule": "Monday -- Small Arms Only (.38 
caliber and under), Tuesday -- Ladies Shotgun Day," right through "Sunday -- 
Gun Cleaning -- Off Day (gestures of profanity only)." 
</P>
<P>
Only L.A. would take to heart, as its city song, a parody of the form: Randy 
Newman's "I Love L.A.," which features such provocative lines as, "Look at that 
bum over there, man. He's down on his knees." Not exactly Chamber of Commerce 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
That's what's unique about L.A. It has a sense of humor about itself. And 
that's what Orange County lacks, a failing that might be expected of the region 
that produced Richard Nixon. Irvine's civic motto is "Another Day in Paradise." 
No joke intended. 
</P>
<P>
You know what constitutes a crisis in Orange County? A nude photo of John 
Lennon at a Fullerton art exhibit. Or a garage door left open more than 15 
minutes, violating the law in one of those "gated communities." Can you imagine 
Orange County hosting a gala, as L.A. did, for the opening of the world's first 
Bra Museum? 
</P>
<P>
I admit I've pondered moving there. After all, it may be another 20 years 
before it catches up with L.A.'s smog and overdevelopment. But you can see 
Orange County going through the early stages of smoggy buildup: denial. Orange 
County has no smog. Orange County has no smog. Orange County has no smog. 
</P>
<P>
That haze over the mountains east of Irvine must come from the smudge pots 
heating the orange trees. San Diego released a study that found that more than 
half of its smog blows in from L.A. It must leapfrog over Orange County. Or 
perhaps L.A.'s smog heads to Denver and then catches a connector flight south. 
</P>
<P>
But back to orange trees for a moment. Ever notice how easy they are to knock 
down? You can get a firsthand view along the roadways in Orange County. You 
think Medflies inflict damage? When the developers are finished, orange trees 
will be as scarce as seals at Seal Beach. And then the only thing orange about 
Orange County will be the interiors of Denny's restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
It's often said that Orange County has no history, no roots. That isn't so. Its 
Spanish heritage is lovingly reflected in city names such as Mission Viejo. 
True, the name's misspelled and grammatically incorrect -- it should be Mision 
Vieja -- but what did those Spaniards know about attracting home buyers anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Still, the area does hold certain attractions for me. I detest gardening, so 
the postage-stamp-sized front lawns down there would be a plus. And I go to bed 
early, so I wouldn't mind the fact that nothing is open after 10 p.m. I'd miss 
foreign movies, which seem to be banned there. Until it recently erected a big 
arts complex, culture in Orange County consisted mainly in naming an airport 
after John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
I'd also miss college football -- Cal State Disneyland's grid action doesn't 
quite measure up to USC's or UCLA's -- as well as pro basketball. In the 
ultimate insult, the Clippers, L.A.'s second-string pro basketball team, 
refused to move to Fullerton. Or Anaheim. (That's another thing about Orange 
County: It doesn't seem to have a center -- except for South Coast Plaza.) 
</P>
<P>
Talk about an identity problem. The Rams play in Anaheim Stadium but still call 
themselves the Los Angeles Rams. And when the Angels moved there from L.A., 
they were also afraid to adopt a local name, calling themselves California 
Angels instead. One thing about Anaheim Stadium, though: If I ever had a 
hankering to be among clean-livin' folks, I could sit in its Family Section, 
where drinking and cussing -- but not smoking -- are forbidden. The Angels were 
one of the first to introduce this approach to watching baseball, which sort of 
sums up the G-rated view of life in that other county. 
</P>
<P>
Move to Orange County? I'd sooner get the hell out of California.

PARADISE PRESERVED ;

FILOLI, IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, IS A STEP BACK TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF LAVISH 
ESTATE GARDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE MOST ELEGANT PUBLIC GARDEN in the state is virtually unknown by Southern 
Californians. Located in Woodside, in an oak-speckled valley just south of San 
Francisco, it easily compares with the classic European gardens that inspired 
its design. Named Filoli, an acronym for "fight, love, live," by its Faustian 
builder, William B. Bourn Jr., the estate is now a property of the National 
Trust for Historic Preservation. Bourn had the good fortune to inherit a 
hard-rock gold mine and the foresight to invest in water -- thus controlling 
Northern California's two most valuable resources. Suitably financed, he set 
about building his country place in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
He had the perfect spot, at the head of his own Crystal Springs Reservoir, 
which supplies San Francisco with water. Willis Polk, the designer of San 
Francisco City Hall, did the grand Irish country house, and Bruce Porter, a 
painter and designer of stained-glass windows, laid out the gardens (one walled 
garden is planted to resemble a window at Chartres Cathedral). 
</P>
<P>
In 1937, Mrs. William P. Roth purchased the property. An avid and knowledgeable 
horticulturist, she was careful not to tamper with the original scheme. A crew 
of expert gardeners, most of them Italian (many were in their 60s and 70s by 
the time the garden was transferred to the Trust), kept the garden impeccably 
maintained. Filoli is now one of the few grand estate gardens from the Country 
Place Era (which began at the turn of the century and ended with the 
Depression) that still looks as it did. 
</P>
<P>
Walking through the gates takes one back to this golden age of lavish gardens. 
"When I first arrived, it was like stepping into 'Alice in Wonderland' or the 
'Secret Garden,' " recalls Lucy Tolmach, superintendent of the garden. "It was 
so charming and so well preserved." A rustic copse of olives softens the 
transition from native oak savanna to man-made landscape. Once inside, yews, 
hedges and brick walls assert their formality -- everything is prim and pruned. 
The gardens are laid out along classic Italian-French lines with a series of 
walks connecting enclosed spaces and the allees tying the parts together 
visually. As is a characteristic of the Country Place Era, borders are brimming 
with flowers in bloom, as they are most of the year (these photographs were 
taken last August). 
</P>
<P>
Tours of the gardens are conducted, by reservation only, Tuesday through 
Saturday. Dedicated gardeners might enjoy the self-guided tour on Friday, which 
allows time to study the plants (reservations not required). Admission: $8; no 
children under 12. Telephone (415) 364-2880, or write to Filoli, Canada Road, 
Woodside 94062.

Virtually a companion film to the subsequent "Mean Streets," Martin Scorsese's 
1968 debut feature takes us into the impacted world of Manhattan's Little 
Italy, in which Harvey Keitel (pictured, in his film debut) does a lot of 
hanging out and is steeped in a very Catholic Madonna-prostitute complex about 
women. Zina Bethune is the captivating woman who seems from another world -- 
one that Keitel struggles to grasp. (A&amp;E Monday at 1 p.m.) KEVIN THOMAS

GOOD COVERAGE TO SPARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would just like to thank ESPN for its fine coverage of the Masters Bowling 
Tournament on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN allowed the bowlers to finish out their games while we watched rather than 
going to commercials, and the last game was played without commercial 
interruption. It was so different from watching ABC, which is continually going 
to commercials while the competitors bowl through their frames, and then 
apprises viewers of the scores afterward. I don't know of any other sports 
where that sort of thing is allowed to happen. If it did, the fans would be 
irate, but even now in bowling it is allowed to continue this way.

Q &amp; A: MARTHA QUINN: BACK WHERE SHE FIRST BELONGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martha Quinn bubbles over like a carbonated hot spring during an earthquake. 
Just ask any reporter who has ever interviewed the venerable MTV veejay. In 
print interviews she has been called perky, pert, piquant, frisky, pixie, 
bouncy, gamin, sprite and relentlessly effervescent. If you want to know what 
Quinn is like, just look in the thesaurus under "activity." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn arrived at MTV in 1981 as a wide-eyed graduate fresh from New York 
University. She won a fast following on the brash new music channel, drawing 
more fan mail than any other veejay because of her ability to speak to the 
camera like it was her best friend. 
</P>
<P>
But in December of 1986, MTV traded in its "used" lineup of veejays for newer 
models. Quinn packed up and made for Los Angeles, where she studied acting and 
picked up what work she could. Commercials. Guest spots on TV shows. Even 
stand-up comedy (she's hosting A&amp;E's "Evening at the Improv" on June 30). 
Last year, she co-starred in CBSU short-lived revival series, "The Bradys." 
</P>
<P>
Back in video musicland, however, it seemed that people who want their MTV also 
want their Martha Quinn. So MTV rehired Quinn to host a classics show. Now, a 
year later, the 31-year-old Quinn is back by popular demand as MTV's 
prime-time, weekday veejay from 8 to 11:30 p.m. What's more, MTV agreed to let 
her tape her show in Los Angeles as part of its planned expansion to the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch in Universal City with Daniel Cerone, Quinn talked about the ups and 
downs of her career. 
</P>
<P>
Why did MTV decide to put you back in a prime-time slot? 
</P>
<P>
I'm like Phil Collins in (the rock group) Genesis. When Peter Gabriel left 
Genesis, Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks auditioned hundreds of 
singers. And one day somebody turned around and said, "Well, what about Phil? 
He's not bad." Before I went back to MTV last year, they were searching for 
this prime-time veejay. And I'd come in, do my shift and leave. I guess 
sometimes the things in your own back yard are the hardest to see. One day 
somebody finally said, "Well, what about Martha?" 
</P>
<P>
What was your response? 
</P>
<P>
I said, "I can't move to New York." I was involved in a series ("The Bradys"), 
and I had a Sprite commercial that just premiered on the Academy Awards. It's 
like I have two legs to my career, and I had been working really hard to 
strengthen my acting leg. I just couldn't put it into a cast and move to New 
York; it would atrophy. Oh! I'm the analogy queen. I kill myself. 
</P>
<P>
Seriously, I thought that would basically be the end of it. But they called me 
up and said, "Okay." So the mountain moved to Mohammed. And here she is, you're 
having lunch with her, Mohammed Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
You seem committed to stay in Los Angeles. When MTV first let you go, what made 
you move out here? 
</P>
<P>
I simply had no reason to stay in New York. No reason at all. My grandfather 
had just died. I had just lost my job. The two things that were keeping me in 
New York were gone. It felt like it was time. I had been at MTV for six years, 
and it was the only job I ever had. So I was really at the edge of the diving 
board anyway. I definitely got pushed, but I was at the edge and would have had 
to make the jump soon, because people need to grow and change. 
</P>
<P>
You had a hard time at first in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
When I first came out here, there was a lot of resistance. "Oh, no no no. The 
MTV girl. We want an actress." And it was really, really frustrating to try and 
convince people that I didn't need to be discussing Axl Rose in order to be 
likable. I had a lot of other qualities in me. People thought, "Yeah, she can 
be all right. But let somebody else hire her first." I'm grateful and indebted 
to the Domino's Pizza people for hiring me. That was my first commercial after 
MTV. I got that totally as an actress, totally on my own. 
</P>
<P>
From MTV to "The Bradys." That's a wild jump. Were you criticized at all for 
that? 
</P>
<P>
No. It was an incredible spot for me. I grew up with the Bradys. I mean, being 
Mrs. Bobby Brady-could you imagine? I don't care if nobody watched the new 
show, everybody knows about the Bradys, and everybody knows that I was on "The 
Bradys," and that I was working in a different capacity. I was working as an 
actress on a big-name series. And that has done really well for me out here.... 
Anyway, I was sort of the Brady of MTV, so it's really not a stretch at all if 
you think about it. 
</P>
<P>
Was there a sense of satisfaction being asked back to MTV as prime-time veejay? 
</P>
<P>
MTV has been so completely supportive of me. I know what you're saying-did it 
feel gratifying to be asked back? I don't know. You know, I don't hold anything 
against them. You just do what you have to do, and that's what they felt they 
had to do at that time. That's just how things work. I've learned now that I 
can come back. I can survive. That's important. Because, guess what? I will be 
fired again. Because this is show business. 
</P>

SEDGWICK CLAIMS WINSTON 200 FOR 2ND YEAR IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Sedgwick of Van Nuys started from the pole position and never looked back 
Saturday night at Saugus Speedway, leading all 200 laps to win his second 
consecutive Winston 200 before 4,377. 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick, the 1989 NASCAR Winston West Rookie of the Year and top qualifier, 
took over first place in the Winston West points standings. 
</P>
<P>
The winner was never seriously challenged, as second-place qualifier Hershel 
McGriff of Green Valley, Ariz., was troubled by pit stops. That left Bill 
Schmitt of Redding and John Krebs of Roseville as the only true competition for 
Sedgwick, 35. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitt finished second, two seconds behind Sedgwick, and Krebs was a close 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick had just one pit stop, changing two tires. He averaged 55.788 m.p.h. 
in a Spears Manufacturing Chevrolet Lumina. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys did a great job in setting the car up," Sedgwick said. "That's the 
key, setting the car up. We were watching those left-side tires close. Normally 
you can't go the whole race with tires like that, so we kind of lucked out on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick took home $5,850. Schmitt earned $3,000 and Krebs won $2,175. 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick's victory never seemed in doubt after he established his lead. 
</P>
<P>
He entered the pit on Lap 123 and thanks to his crew's quick work was able to 
emerge still in first place. The race was slowed by seven caution flags for 34 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sportsman Division, Jerry Gay of Lakeside held off Larry Krieger of 
Reseda and Tom Eurton of Valencia, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Gay, who is fourth in the points standings at El Cajon, also was challenged by 
Simi Valley's Craig Rayburn. Rayburn was in second place when he crashed on the 
second turn on Lap 13, damaging the front end of his car. He withdrew from the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Will Harper of Tarzana, the current points leader at Saugus, made a skillful 
pass on the final turn of Lap 40 to take fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
John Cran of Reseda won the eight-lap Sportsman trophy dash after earning the 
pole position. Larry Krieger of Reseda won the fastest heat of the Sportsman 
division heat races. 
</P>
<P>
In a pit-stop competition before the Winston 200, the crew of 1989 Winston West 
Series champion Schmitt was the fastest of five teams. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitt's crew changed tires and simulated adding a tankful of gas in 15.74 
seconds, three seconds faster than the second-place team.

JAMES FLANIGAN: CAT LANDS ON ITS FEET IN COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Flanigan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eyes of American business are focused these days on Caterpillar Inc. as it 
spends billions to automate its factories and tries to stay No. 1 in fiercely 
competitive world markets. 
</P>
<P>
Most investment people nod approvingly -- "They're doing the right things," say 
analysts. But they also have reservations, recalling that another giant, 
General Motors, spent $40 billion on automation in the early 1980s, with 
unimpressive results so far. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Caterpillar's figures are not reassuring. Revenues are increasing 
for the Peoria-based maker of construction equipment, but profits are down -- 
just as management told shareholders they would be -- due partly to costs of 
the automation program. So the final verdict on how successful Cat's 
reorganization will be must wait until next year, or even later in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Why should you care? Because Cat is a very important company -- $11 billion in 
sales, the second-largest U.S. exporter (after Boeing), an employer of 42,000 
in the United States (and 18,000 overseas) with a ripple effect throughout the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
And because Cat's $2-billion investment and reorganization could set a pattern, 
affirming that U.S. companies can compete successfully and encouraging others 
to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in an often disturbing modern business world, Cat can teach you the real 
meaning of 50-cent words and concepts such as long-term investment, global 
trade and competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech, Cat Chairman George Schaefer explained succinctly how the 
world has changed. Business was a breeze from the end of World War II to 1980, 
he said, with something new always coming along to provide a market for Cat's 
bulldozers and tractors -- from the rebuilding of Europe to U.S. interstate 
highways to development in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Then it all ended. The recession of the early 1980s coupled with the high value 
of the U.S. dollar hurt Cat competitively. Sales fell from $9 billion in 1981 
to $5.4 billion in 1983 -- a 40% decline in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The market didn't so much shrink as change. Big projects gave way to smaller, 
more diverse operations, often run by small owner-builders. So Cat expanded its 
product line. Today it has 300 models of construction machinery compared to 150 
before, and a whole new line of light equipment for smaller jobs. 
</P>
<P>
One thing leads to another. That variety in models and customers forced an end 
to the way Cat manufactured things. A typical plant at Cat's complex in Peoria 
used to go for a week or more making thousands of copies of a single part, 
which would be set aside in inventory -- millions of dollars in parts sitting 
around -- until the rest of the product could be made and shipped. 
</P>
<P>
That sounds wasteful but in the days when it took a full eight-hour shift to 
change machinery on a production line, it was more efficient to do things that 
way than to shut down frequently to change tools or models. 
</P>
<P>
Now computer-guided machines do things differently. "You tell the machine to 
change tools and instantly it turns out a different model," says a Cat veteran. 
So technology allows flexibility, and saves money on inventory. But it also 
demands other changes. 
</P>
<P>
If you're responding to diverse customers with instantly flexible 
manufacturing, it makes no sense to have people in the field waiting for 
decisions from headquarters on pricing or production. So Cat is reorganizing to 
give more people more responsibility. "If they succeed, they'll have a very 
powerful organization," says an industry expert. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that corporate reorganization, rightly done, does not simply 
displace people. It increases their responsibility and productivity. Cat 
employs more people today than in 1983 -- and has increased wages and benefits 
35% since then. At the same time, it has boosted total sales 105% and sales per 
employee 48% to $185,000. Productivity has risen, in other words. 
</P>
<P>
But Cat hasn't let up, hasn't harvested those productivity gains to buy up its 
own stock or make acquisitions, as many companies did in the '80s. Instead, it 
has used its financial strength to support dealers and increase sales overseas 
-- from $2.5 billion in 1983 to $6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Cat has held its leading share of the world's markets against 
stiff competition from Komatsu Ltd., a $6-billion (revenue) Japanese company 
that has a joint venture in the United States with Dresser Industries. "Cat 
holds 35% of the world market in construction equipment overall, and 50% or 
more in larger machines," says analyst Steven Colbert of Prudential Bache 
Securities. It even succeeds in Komatsu's home market through a joint venture 
with Mitsubishi, called New Caterpillar Mitsubishi, which supplies 70% of the 
construction machines for Japan's new Kansai Airport. 
</P>
<P>
So what's left to decide about the reorganization? Whether Cat can make enough 
profit to do something for its shareholders. Its stock price, at $66 a share 
recently, is only a few dollars higher than it was 10 years ago. And that may 
not improve in a hurry: U.S. construction markets are slow, and overseas 
markets are weakening; Eastern Europe's great potential for new construction is 
still only a promise. "Cat's earnings may fall to $4 a share this year," -- 
from $4.90 in 1989 -- says analyst Michael Braig of Cleveland's Prescott, Ball 
&amp; Turben investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
But Cat, just because it keeps investing to reduce costs, will be able to 
operate profitably in bad times -- and benefit tremendously in good. Sometime 
in the '90s, say analysts, Cat will earn $10 to $15 a share -- indicating a 
stock price that could triple. "If you're managing a large diversified 
portfolio, arguably Caterpillar should be at the top of the list," says analyst 
Robert McCarthy of Chicago's Duff &amp; Phelps research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if American business is looking to Caterpillar for guidance, there's 
reason to hope for us all.

AS THEY WATCH THE BABY BOOMERS NOISILY AGE, THE NATION'S 'BUSTERS' WONDER IF 
THEY'LL EVER MAKE IT INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A breaching whale on the sea of American demographics, the baby boom generation 
shocked its elders early on. They rocked out with Elvis, the Beatles and the 
Rolling Stones. As teen-agers and young adults, they turned to civil rights, 
the women's movement and anti-war protests, launching an entire fashion 
industry of rainbow-hued hippie clothes in the process. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the "baby busters" -- born right after in the so-called "birth 
dearth" years -- slam-danced to the Sex Pistols and the Dead Kennedys. Lately, 
they have taken to head-banging with groups such as Guns N' Roses. If they seem 
quiet compared to the generation that once preached "sex, drugs, rock 'n' 
roll," it may be because they have inherited the ever-darkening boomer fallout: 
an era of safe sex, "just say no" to drugs and Tipper Gore's battles to censor 
their music -- when it manages to get a note in edgewise amid classic rock. The 
fashion-minded among them have preferred nihilistic black -- worn with black 
accessories. Since this age group became old enough to buy household 
furnishings, even black toasters and flatware have become stylish. 
</P>
<P>
Some say it's an apt color for a generation that's going to have an uphill 
fight to match the boomers' impact on American life. And now that the busters 
are teen-agers and young adults, some of them say they are beginning to resent 
the No. 2 position. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a baby buster is like being an American in France. It's clear they're 
not speaking your language and you're not in charge. You're a guest. Busters 
look at TV and they don't see themselves. They see the generation older than 
them," observes psychologist/gerontologist Ken Dychtwald, author of "Age Wave." 
</P>
<P>
Many baby busters sadly agree. They're weary of the endless boomer hoopla, and 
are fond of pointing out that Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney are pushing 50. 
They worry that all the good jobs will be snatched up by the boomer hordes 
ahead of them. And they wonder, given the 
</P>
<P>
growing markets for Retin-A, Minoxodil and Clairol, if their elders will ever 
grow up and cede the mass media spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere, they point out, are the artifacts of boomer youth culture, from 
"The Donna Reed Show" reruns to the resurgence of bell-bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, their culture has barely been defined. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sort of like a lost generation," sighs Christy Mozilo, 24, a Hollywood 
set decorator. "We weren't at Woodstock. When we talk about how we grew up, it 
was in the era of punk and Reagan. There's nothing for us to identify with. The 
media underplaysour intelligence because we weren't part of anything historical 
or political." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Elliott got so sick of boomer-born classic rock and retro-boomer TV shows 
such as "The Wonder Years" that he founded an organization to jolt aging 
boomers out of their prolonged adolescence: the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Time. 
</P>
<P>
"When is it going to be this (baby buster) generation's moment in the sun?" 
asks Elliott, a Los Angeles rehabilitation social worker whose clients are drug 
users and the mentally ill. "You've got the sheer numbers (of the estimated 76 
million baby boomers) weighing against it." 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Elliott laments, his generation "doesn't have demographic 
critical mass. (The baby busters) weren't raised in an age of an expanding 
America. They matured against a background of decay and despair, a far more 
interesting and sobering attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"What is hardest for a lot of people to realize about this group is what their 
fondest dreams are. (Baby busters) just don't have any. They weren't brought up 
in an era of expanding optimism. For a lot of these people, the first president 
they can remember is Nixon. Nobody ever asked them what can they do for their 
country . . . 
</P>
<P>
"These people have little faith in anything. This includes their own teachers, 
poets, rock stars. They are people without heroes. Consequently, they're a more 
self-reliant bunch." 
</P>
<P>
Though 28-year-old Elliott is technically a tail-end baby boomer, he finds he 
has little in common with the boomers and identifies more closely with the 
busters, America's abandoned demographic. 
</P>
<P>
Just how lost is today's youth generation? 
</P>
<P>
Even the U.S. Census Bureau admits it has done few studies of busters as a 
group. According to bureau statistician Arlene Saluter, there were 36.8 million 
Americans age 15 to 24 in 1988. The bureau knows that young busters live with 
their parents longer than boomers did (among 18- to 24-year-olds, 54% were 
still living with their parents in 1988, contrasted with 48% of like-aged 
individuals in 1980). 
</P>
<P>
But that's about it study-wise, says Saluter, adding that she has seen no 
demographic examinations of busters done outside the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Russell, editor of American Demographics magazine and author of "100 
Predictions for the Baby Boom," affirms the lack of serious research on 
busters. What has been written about them has been based on anecdotal findings, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
But even without facts and figures to bolster their suspicions, many busters 
conclude that because they follow such a huge group in the populace, they face 
undue competition in the job market. While entry-level job openings may be 
plentiful because of the fewer numbers of young people to fill them, many 
busters complain that the pathways to more satisfying positions are already 
clogged with baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
Consuelo Preciado, for example, is a just-graduated USC journalism student who 
has been looking for newspaper work -- so far unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
"It's seems so competitive. It's a pretty scary feeling I'm experiencing. I 
haven't been able to get any job offers that are impressive. Someone in 
Washington, D.C., offered me a job, but it wasn't permanent. It was for a year. 
I feel as if I'm being overlooked by employers, and I know a lot of qualified 
college graduates who are having the same problems," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not being offered the kinds of jobs that would be considered careers. . 
. . A lot of people say because I'm a minority and I have bilingual skills it's 
supposed to be easier. But I know I'm going to have to struggle twice as hard 
-- because I'm a minority and I don't have the experience that baby boomers 
already out there have." 
</P>
<P>
According to some experts, the job market is only one area in which many 
busters will experience difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a large number of young people who just don't feel life is going to 
turn out well for them," says Dychtwald, an Emeryville, Calif.-based lecturer 
and consultant whose clients include Time Inc. and CBS. "America has aged up 
with the baby boomers and paid less attention to youth. In politics, increasing 
amounts of dollars are being spent on people in their 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s, 
and there's a decreasing amount of money being spent on youth." 
</P>
<P>
Dychtwald points out: "If you pull resources away from older people, they 
already have their values established. They may be lonely and poor, but they 
have already been formed as humans. 
</P>
<P>
"However, if you pull resources away from young people, it can mean they will 
never have an education and values," he warns. "They will be going through life 
without these foundations. There's not a lot of emphasis and nourishment and 
support for the baby busters." 
</P>
<P>
Dychtwald sees the consequences of such policies in everyday decisions about 
the American Dream: decisions on whether or not to take drugs, whether or not 
to commit a crime, whether or not to go to work. And, he notes, those options 
can be profoundly influenced by a lingering feeling that "No matter what I do, 
life isn't going to turn out well. What have I got to lose?" 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Dychtwald predicts that as busters move into adulthood, they will fall 
into three categories: 
</P>
<P>
* A small group that succeeds no matter what and proves Social Darwinism's 
survival-of-the-fittest theory. 
</P>
<P>
* A large group that settles for a lesser version of the American Dream, 
telling themselves such things as "I may not be able to buy a BMW, but a Chevy 
Blazer's just fine." These people will emphasize recreation and 
self-satisfaction rather than career achievements. 
</P>
<P>
* A significantly large underclass of disenfranchised, disillusioned busters. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some in the first group feel they will have to help their disenchanted 
friends as well as restructure an entire society as it disintegrates. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and my peers feel we have this burden to fix the country because of the 
problems that have occurred with baby boomers. The 'thirtysomething,' white 
bread, yuppie mentality has been very damaging. It's intellectually very 
sterile," says Steve Lerner, a UC Santa Cruz sophomore majoring in economics 
and Japanese studies. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I have a secure future. But this country is going to be a nation of 
elderly people, with government money all being squandered on pet projects, 
Star Wars, and a military economy instead of a peace-time economy. Those of us 
who are in school are acutely aware of the problems ahead." 
</P>
<P>
So are some boomers. Listen to Dennis Berry, who founded the Westchester, 
Pa.-based American Assn. of Baby Boomers: 
</P>
<P>
"Social Security is a very good deals for today's retirees. It's a bad deal for 
the baby boomer. And it will be an absolute financial disaster for the 
generation following the baby boomers. The reason is that the benefits are 
financed by taxes on today's workers. Today, there are three to 3 1/2 workers 
paying the taxes for the benefits to support each retiree. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time our generation, the baby boom generation, has retired, there could 
be as few as 1 1/2 workers paying taxes to support each retiree. . . . And what 
if they cure cancer? What if they cure heart disease? People are living longer 
and they're drawing these benefits longer. Something is going to have to 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Some experts -- and busters -- are confident something will. "The fact is that 
social structures are continually adapting to different population changes," 
says Vern Bengtson, professor of gerontology and sociology at USC. "There is 
going to be enormous technological change between now and the year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
Bengtson maintains that education is the key to buster survival: "If you have 
an education, you'll be able to take advantage of those technological changes. 
There will always be avenues of opportunity for people who are well trained, 
well qualified and hard working. The danger is for the undereducated. Their 
mobility will be blocked by the undereducated of the previous generation." 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old professor knows firsthand what it's like to be part of a baby 
bust generation. "I was born in 1941," he explains. "There was a baby boom in 
the 1920s. There was also one between 1900 and 1910. We have had cycles of a 
baby boom or a baby bust that seem to come about every 30 years. Today's young 
baby bust generation seems to be totally unique, but it's happened before." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Bengtson doesn't believe the baby bust picture is all that bleak: "My 
generation was highly advantaged because we were fewer than our predecessors. 
The previous generation had opened up new social positions for us. That's the 
case today. The baby boomers have opened up new social positions and 
institutions. The baby busters who follow will have it relatively easier than 
the baby boomers did." 
</P>
<P>
Landon K. Jones, managing editor of People magazine and author of "Great 
Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation," concurs: "They (busters) 
are overlooked. They are frustrated. The youth culture today is more segmented 
and fragmented and alienated than ever before. But the one thing they have 
going for them is that, because they're in shorter supply, their economic 
opportunities are better." 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable agreement and disagreement on this issue, among busters 
and buster observers. 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as psychologist/consultant Ross Goldstein, president of San 
Francisco-based Generation Insights, insist busters will eventually be in great 
demand: "Right now, they're not. But in the next 10 years, there will be a 
shortage of skilled people to take the places of the baby boomers. Highly 
qualified and technically skilled baby busters will especially find it's a 
seller's market." 
</P>
<P>
And some busters are not only optimistic about their futures but admit to 
enjoying boomer legacies, especially the music. 
</P>
<P>
"All people my age listen to music of the '60s, and a lot of kids think the 
quality of the songwriting and singers was better than what's out now," 
enthuses Tatiana Palmer, a recent graduate of Santa Moncia High School who 
plans to study psychobiology and other neurosciences at Williams College in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel pretty confident about the future," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
But Palmer does have one observation about the different values of boomers and 
busters: "My mom's always encouraging me to take risks and be wild and crazy, 
and I'm more conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Other busters similarly report only incidental frustrations. Ad Hardin, a 
senior in the independent scholar program at Vermont's Middlebury College, 
suspects he might have missed something, but only when he turns on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"What bothers me is that when 'My Generation' by The Who comes on, I know that 
when people listened to it originally, they knew it was about them. It was a 
very empowering feeling," he says. "When someone from our generation hears that 
song, it's pretty clear that it doesn't apply to us." 
</P>
<P>
Many busters claim to be totally untouched by such generational distinctions. 
Of those interviewed by The Times, about half had not heard of the term baby 
buster and many, like Karen Kubiani, feel the comments and analyses of 
demographers have little relevance to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"This hasn't affected me at all. I didn't even realize that's the generation 
I'm in. I haven't had any kind of problems looking for jobs," says Kubiani, 23, 
a personnel recruiter for the Los Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers. 
Kubiani also maintains she is unfazed by the media's preoccupation with boomer 
lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
"Baby busters should be grateful for their moment out of the limelight before 
they really start being studied and hounded by marketers," advises Thia Golson, 
editor of The Boomer Report, a newsletter published in New York City. "They 
don't have to worry about being overlooked for long. The American marketing 
community will always smell out money." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps rather shortly. The leading edge of the baby busters turn 25 this year, 
the age at which consumers become prime advertising targets, according to 
marketing aficionado Andy Shoun. He is the 25-year-old program director for 
KROQ-FM, a radio station whose listeners are chiefly in the 18 to 29 age 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Shoun, who finds himself relatively unscathed by any baby bust downside, 
suggests his generation possesses distinct advantages. Prime among them is 
knowing, in advance, the pitfalls of such boomer experiments as yuppiehood. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of young people not going so much with material things as with 
quality of life," Shoun reports. "They want to live someplace where it's quiet, 
instead of someplace that has marble floors. They want a shorter commute, and 
they want to breathe clean air on the weekends." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in Dychtwald's opinion, perhaps the richest legacy of baby boomers will 
be the results of their ill-fated test runs. "The baby boomers went off and 
tried out hundreds of different lifestyles from which the busters can now pick 
and choose," he says. "The busters don't have to clear all those paths. The 
boomers are the R &amp; D (research and development) group for the busters." 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Dillenberg, 30, who co-founded with Elliott the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Time, agrees. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of being a baby buster is you're not a baby boomer. Hopefully, 
you don't have to repeat their mistakes," he declares. "No group is completely 
worthless. They can always serve as a bad example."

FREEWHEELING TOUR TAKES VISITORS PAST D. C.'S SCANDAL SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTONCHARLES HILLINGER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bus tour begins on a patriotic note with a taped rendition of "Yankee 
Doodle Dandy," "Over There" and other high-spirited songs. 
</P>
<P>
A George Bush look-alike strolled to the front of the bus as it rolled down 
Connecticut Avenue. The "President" (in the person of actor Ed Henley) asked 
passengers to put their hands over their hearts and repeat after him: 
</P>
<P>
"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States and to the Republicans 
for which it stands. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Henley held up a copy of the Washington Post with its bold headlines on the 
latest development in the Mayor Marion Barry matter and whooped: 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the Scandal Tour!" 
</P>
<P>
The streets of Washington are always jammed with buses. Some carry 
schoolchildren on field trips, some are filled with tour groups from around the 
nation and others are full of foreign visitors, who hear about our history in 
dozens of languages. 
</P>
<P>
Since Aug. 27, 1988, another sort of bus has been rolling past the famous 
buildings and monuments. For $30 a person, this bus offers an irreverent and 
light-heartedly different tour of Washington -- the seamy, scurrilous, even 
silly side of the capital of the free world. 
</P>
<P>
It's a theater-on-wheels, and it takes the stage -- or, rather, the bus -- six 
times a week here. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where Mayor Barry was busted in room 727," said tour guide Henley as 
the bus passed the Vista Hotel. "So much scandal happens in this city, we have 
to constantly update our itinerary." 
</P>
<P>
In its 11-mile romp through the heart of D.C., the bus troupe may satirize any 
of 120 different scandals that are brewing or have brewed in the shadows of the 
monuments. 
</P>
<P>
As the bus passes the Soviet Embassy, Henley, as President Bush, announced: 
"OK. Ready. Everybody shout together as loud as you can: We won the Cold War! 
We won the Cold War!" 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, there is a brief report on Warren Harding's escapades with 
a mistress in a cloak closet. Around the corner, across from the Old Executive 
Office Building, Fawn Hall (actress Shari Elliker) pointed out the window and 
said: "Over there is Shred Center." 
</P>
<P>
At another corner, the voice of Oliver North was heard testifying at the 
Iran-Contra hearings over the strains of the "Marine Hymn." 
</P>
<P>
The bus passed the Watergate complex where the bungled 1972 burglary of 
Democratic campaign headquarters led to Richard Nixon's resignation two years 
later. As President Nixon, actor John Simmons paced the aisle of the bus, 
giving his famous victory signs and muttering: 
</P>
<P>
"I was appalled at the senseless illegal activities. I am the President. I will 
always be the President." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the tour, a half-dozen actors and actresses change costume in the 
restroom at the rear of the bus. Each takes on the character of someone caught 
up in a political scandal. 
</P>
<P>
As the bus passed the 1852 red sandstone Norman Castle, the first Smithsonian 
building, Henley talked about one of the District of Columbia's greatest 
benefactors -- James Smithson, "the bastard son of the first Duke of 
Northumberland." 
</P>
<P>
"So incensed was the English scientist over his illegitimate birth that when he 
died in 1829, he left his substantial fortune to America instead of Great 
Britain to establish the famous institution named in his honor," related 
Henley. 
</P>
<P>
As the bus rounded the Tidal Basin, Henley asked, "Remember when Rep. Wilbur 
Mills was stopped by police for drunk driving and his girlfriend stripper Fanne 
Foxe, the 'Argentine Bombshell' flew out of the car's passenger door and 
plunged into the Tidal Basin?" 
</P>
<P>
At the halfway point, the tour bus stops and discharges its passengers to the 
sidewalk outside a three-story brownstone townhouse in tony Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
This is where, some say, presidential candidate Gary Hart's hopes were dashed 
when Donna Rice was discovered exiting the back door. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the bus, actor Simmons as Ronald Reagan pointed out HUD headquarters, 
vehemently denying the initials stand for "hundreds of unethical developers." 
</P>
<P>
As the charming Jacqueline Bird Roosevelt, "head of the School of First 
Ladies," actress Marianne Curan dished some dirt surrounding the man whose name 
is on the Washington Monument: 
</P>
<P>
"He did wear wooden teeth, you know. Martha frequently had splinters in her 
lips. They raised two children by Martha's previous marriage. The father of our 
country was sterile, unable to produce children of his own." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Henley held up a copy of Life magazine with Barbara Bush's picture on the 
cover and "revealed" that the First Lady gave Dan Quayle one of Millie's 
puppies. "He named the puppy Checkers," Henley said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
Rick London, 35, came up with the idea for the Scandal Tour. "My relatives were 
always coming to town asking me to take them to Gary Hart's apartment and to 
Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working with John Simmons, who has been performing with the Gross 
National Product (acting company) and doing satires on Washington politics in 
Georgetown for the past 10 years. I suggested we put together the bus tour," 
said London, who has hired GNP actors and actresses to portray the characters 
on the Scandal Tour. 
</P>
<P>
During its first full year in business, about 3,000 people took the Scandal 
Tour, producing gross sales of $80,000. Since last August, 6,000 more have come 
along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
Sales so far this year have totalled $168,000, the tour's operators said. The 
original $20 fare has been raised to $30 to reflect rising costs, said London. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the weekday Scandal Tours are chartered by groups, weekend tours 
continue to be filled by capital tourists traveling on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"The nation's capital is the original theme park. All the buildings are in 
place," said London. "We sent President and Mrs. Bush gift certificates. But 
they haven't used them yet." 
</P>

VIDEOTAPING BY DEPUTIES DRAWS FIRE;

<P>
WEST HOLLYWOOD: THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAYS TAPES OF PARADES AND MARCHES ARE 
USED FOR CROWD-CONTROL TRAINING. GAYS CLAIM HARASSMENT.

<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's practice of videotaping marches, 
parades and other events has come under criticism in West Hollywood, where city 
officials say the practice has increased tensions between the department and 
the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John Heilman has asked the Sheriff's Department to abandon in West 
Hollywood the practice that it has instituted countywide. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the sheriffs are doing it for any bad purpose," Heilman said. 
"But it is a matter of the perception that Big Brother is watching that 
increases tensions with the sheriffs rather than decreases it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the gay community has frequently been the subject of police raids 
and FBI surveillance. Given the history of this country, there are a lot of 
people who feel very sensitive when they see uniformed police officers 
videotaping a public event." 
</P>
<P>
Heilman said a number of people approached him during an AIDS memorial march 
last month to express their outrage about being filmed by uniformed officers. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department officials say the videotapes are taken not to identify 
faces in a crowd but as training exercises in crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
"We take tapes of these events so that we can train our personnel what to 
expect," said Lt. Richard Odenthal of the Sheriff's Department's emergency 
operations bureau. "We have a lot of people who have never worked with large 
crowds. There are no individual faces used; it's mostly crowd stuff. And the 
officers are in full uniform near a black and white car. There is nothing 
covert about it." 
</P>
<P>
In a June 8 memo, Chief Duane T. Preimsberger reminded those in his field 
operations Region II command of the department's policy on videotaping. 
</P>
<P>
"I view this device as a tool which is critical in protecting our deputies from 
false accusation of brutality and other improprieties," he wrote. "I am 
insisting that this tool be deployed when appropriate and particularly when 
time permits planning for its use. Deployment at loud parties, major 
disturbances and high-profile incidents should become routine." 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, a militant AIDS activist 
group that has staged boisterous sit-in demonstrations at Board of Supervisors 
meetings, said the policy has been used to identify and harass its members. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a questionable practice," said David Etezadi, member of ACT-UP Los 
Angeles. "It appears to us they are using it to identify people in political 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
"They are paranoid," Capt. Rachel Burgess of the West Hollywood station said. 
"We are not trying to videotape individuals. It is just crowds and crowd 
control. We are not concerned about ACT-UP unless they are doing something 
against the law. And we are certainly not trying to expose any gay person." 
</P>
<P>
ACT-UP has received support from the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation 
of Southern California, which has been critical of the videotapings. 
</P>
<P>
"When the police begin photographing or videotaping, it makes people feel they 
are being identified or under surveillance," said Jon Davidson, senior staff 
counsel at the ACLU. "It raises a great concern that that will deter some 
individuals from participating in forms of political expression or protest. The 
government does have a responsibility not to interfere with free speech." 
</P>
<P>
The criticism comes at a time when the city is preparing to play host June 24 
to the 20th annual Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade in West Hollywood, an event 
that draws about 200,000 people and is expected to be broadcast live in 28 
cities in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Public Safety Commission recently recommended that videotaping of 
the parade "not be selective and that representatives of the gay and lesbian 
community be included in the editing process. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's department officials say there are no plans to film the parade, 
although a camera will be available if it is needed in case of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the parade say they have no objections to the Sheriff's 
Department's videotaping the event. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of standard operating procedure for the sheriff's deputies to tape 
our parade. We never thought of it as a negative thing," said Joe Toy, 
president of Christopher Street West Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Wuzzy Spaulding, who co-chairs the West Hollywood Community/Sheriff's 
Conference Committee, agreed. "With all the television coverage that will be at 
the parade, people shouldn't worry about being exposed by the police," he said. 
"Why is it that the television stations are allowed to videotape the event and 
the sheriffs should not?" 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Burgess said she would be willing to show any videotapes made by the West 
Hollywood sheriff's deputies to representatives of community groups as long as 
the tapes are not connected with an ongoing criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
She said her department used the video camera to document problems with the 
nightly feeding program in Plummer Park, showing that many of the homeless in 
the feeding lines had outstanding arrest warrants. "The city used that 
information in making its decision to close down the program," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Burgess said the station has not used the camera to go after those who solicit 
male prostitutes on West Hollywood's east side, as has been requested by some, 
because the issue is a very sensitive one among gays in the community. 
</P>
<P>
But the camera will be used to evaluate police procedures, including the 
conduct of officers during arrests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will send a message to deputies that they will not get away with 
unprofessional behavior, because someone may be watching," she added.

EXPANSION OF TAPIA RECLAMATION PLANT OKD; 
</P>
<P>
MALIBU: COASTAL COMMISSION APPROVES PLAN TO BOOST CAPACITY OF WASTE-WATER 
TREATMENT FACILITY. CRITICS SAY IT WILL WORSEN POLLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid protests from environmentalists and others, the California Coastal 
Commission has approved the expansion of a waste-water treatment facility in 
the Santa Monica Mountains that critics say will worsen pollution at Malibu 
Lagoon State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the state panel Thursday approved a plan to increase the 
capacity of the Tapia Reclamation Plant, next to Malibu Creek several miles 
upstream from the lagoon, from 10 million gallons per day to 16.1 million 
gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District, which serves about 
80,000 residents, including Westlake Village, Agoura Hills and Hidden Hills, 
said they hope to begin work on the $30-million expansion by the end of the 
year and finish by late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted," said Edward McCombs, the water district's general manager. 
"Our aim is to stay in front of the (population) growth projected for our 
service area, and this expansion will enable us to do that." 
</P>
<P>
But although the approval may have been welcome news in some places, it 
disappointed Malibu residents who have for years objected to the plant's 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
They say effluent from the plant emptied into the creek has contributed to 
pollution in the lagoon, helped to swell the creek's banks near expensive homes 
during heavy rains, and has contributed to occasional outbreaks of stinging 
black flies along the creek. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed that the commission chose to fend off the matter," said 
John Murdock, a lawyer for the 2,000-member Malibu Township Council, which is 
opposed to the expansion. "Obviously, increasing the flow in the creek is only 
going to exacerbate the problems." 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials have denied that effluent from the plant, which they 
say is suitable for body contact, has negatively affected the creek or the 
lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
"That creek collects drainage from 150 square miles, and I would say the 
effluent from the plant is probably the only good thing that goes into it," 
said Jim Colbaugh, the water district's director of planning and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that whether or not the effluent is clean, it has 
contributed to increased bacteria and algae growth in the lagoon because, by 
increasing the creek's flow, more water becomes trapped and stagnates in the 
lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Several experts, including a Malibu physician, have said that bacteria levels 
represent a health hazard for swimmers and surfers off the beach near the 
lagoon, which is widely considered to be among the best surfing beaches in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of empirical evidence to suggest that the water coming out of 
the lagoon is unhealthful to swimmers, surfers and anyone else having contact 
with it," Dr. Jeff Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that in 15 years of practicing medicine in Malibu, he has treated 
many patients who have complained of stomach, ear, sinus and other infections 
after swimming or surfing near the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, the commission's decision means that swimmers and 
surfers there will continue to play Russian roulette with their health," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Four members of Malibu's newly elected future City Council sent a letter to the 
panel, asking that the approval be delayed until a new city of Malibu is able 
to devise its own land-use plan. 
</P>
<P>
But the water district's McCombs called the request a "nonstarter" and said 
that if the commission delayed the matter, it would create chaos for residents 
of the water district who will depend on the plant's increased capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Before voting to approve the expansion, Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, who 
lives in Malibu, received assurances from McCombs that water district officials 
would cooperate to help solve the concerns of some of its critics. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, expressed doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like (the commission) put the cart before the horse," said Sara Wan, 
vice president of the Malibu Township Council. "If you know there are problems, 
solve the problems first, and then talk about allowing expansion."

SCHOOL'S RELOCATION A 'LEAP FORWARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the controversy surrounding the University Elementary School move to Ocean 
Park we see the interests of UES parents pitted against progress. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed relocation of University Elementary School to a site adjoining a 
beautiful neighborhood park in Santa Monica is an unusual opportunity for the 
UCLA School of Education, the Santa Monica Unified School District, and parents 
and children of the Ocean Park neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
By extension, the benefits of this model will extend to public education 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The primary function of UES has been and should continue to be the training of 
teachers and development of new educational methods applicable to real world 
classroom and public education constraints. Bringing UES off-campus where it 
will have a cross section of students and real neighborhood conditions does not 
represent a departure from the school's tradition of innovation and leadership. 
It represents another leap forward. 
</P>
<P>
Will UES retain its autonomy? I have seen the outline of the agreement with 
Santa Monica Unified and I am satisfied that the answer is yes. If I am 
fortunate enough to have my daughter attend UES, I will see to it that the 
fertile ground for innovation and development is never compromised. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Unified will also benefit from stimulation and new ideas of having 
a lab school within its system. Just think of the cross-fertilization between 
teachers, parents, administrators and board members!

UNIVERSITY SCHOOL SPARKS EXCITEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1972 I entered Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., having transferred from 
the University of North Carolina. While UNC was and is a typical traditional 
college, Hampshire at the time was a year old and one of a crop of experimental 
institutions of higher education springing up around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the rest of the student body, I was a guinea pig. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 years later, I personally can attest to the fact the experiment was a 
success. And according to a New York Times Magazine article, Hampshire is at 
the forefront of American educational reform. 
</P>
<P>
When I first heard about the possibility that the University Elementary School 
might continue its development and move from the UCLA campus to Ocean Park, my 
instinct was one of wholehearted support because an obviously successful 
experiment was being allowed to flourish. When, as Hampshire College did, an 
institution goes from being an academic exercise to a fully functioning part of 
society, an enormously important step is taken. 
</P>
<P>
Then my wife and I had a son. The possibility that he might participate, as I 
did, in a forward-thinking scholastic endeavor was exciting. The possibility 
that he might participate in such an experiment at the elementary level, and 
not wait until he is 17, was enough to restore my faith in the school systems 
of America.

$2.8-MILLION SELLING PRICE FOR PARKLAND; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVANCY: A TENTATIVE DEAL IS MADE ON 11-ACRE SITE IN THE SANTA CLARITA 
VALLEY. IT'S SEEN AS THE GATEWAY TO A FUTURE STATE PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has reached a tentative agreement to 
purchase 11 acres of parkland in the Santa Clarita Valley for $2.8 million, 
which would be the largest amount ever paid by the state agency for such a 
small parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be considered by the conservancy's board of directors 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the conservancy purchased 145 acres in the same area for 
$500,000 last December. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a lot to pay for 11 acres," Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's 
executive director, conceded last week. But Edmiston said the parcel, although 
relatively small, would provide a gateway to the proposed Santa Clarita 
Woodlands State Park northwest of the interchange of the Golden State and 
Antelope Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 acres abut the Old Road and are zoned for commercial development. If not 
purchased now, the property could be developed and thus cut off access to the 
proposed 6,000-acre state park, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small part of a bigger picture," Carole Stevens, chairwoman of the 
conservancy, said of the land. "It's an access way, and that's why it's 
important to us." 
</P>
<P>
The property would provide a staging ground for hikers planning to reach East 
Canyon and Rice Canyon, described as "exquisitely beautiful" nature preserves 
by Rorie Skei, a conservancy board member. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel has been appraised at $4.5 million, but the conservancy was able to 
negotiate a substantially reduced price because it can pay cash, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was negotiated between the conservancy's staff and 
representatives of property owner Rex Holland. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp. owns an estimated 1,300 acres near the Holland property and had 
planned on using the property for access to The Old Road, which parallels the 
Golden State Freeway, said Clark King, the conservancy's deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
But if the conservancy blocks the route through the Holland property by buying 
the land, that may encourage Chevron and other nearby property owners to sell 
their land for the park, King said. "I've made offers to three major 
landowners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Holland property would complement an adjacent 11 acres, known as the 
Avaness property, which the conservancy purchased in April for $2.3 million. 
That parcel also is zoned for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the conservancy purchased 145 acres north of the Holland and 
Avaness parcels for $500,000. The conservancy dedicated the land last week as 
Towsley Canyon Park, calling it the start of the larger woodlands parks. 
</P>
<P>
Towsley Canyon Park, at the mouth of Towsley Canyon, could hinder efforts by 
Los Angeles County sanitation officials to build a garbage dump in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said the Holland and Avaness properties however are not adjacent to 
Towsley Canyon Park and would not affect entry routes to the dump. In making 
the purchase, the conservancy is "not fighting a landfill battle," he said.

DISGRUNTLED HOLLYWOOD MERCHANTS FORM ORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood merchants have formed their own business watch organization, in part 
to counter efforts by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to start a management 
program headed by a former deputy to City Councilman Michael Woo. 
</P>
<P>
At its first meeting recently, the Hollywood Boulevard District Improvement 
Assn. voted unanimously to oppose the chamber's efforts to organize merchants 
through a contract it awarded to former Woo aide Nina Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber awarded the $56,000 contract to Greenberg without competitive 
bidding and with little notice or publicity. Besides organizing area 
businesses, Greenberg's job description includes organizing merchants to form 
an assessment district in which merchants would be charged for improved city 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of such an assessment district outraged many local merchants at the 
meeting, who said they already pay for services through an existing Hollywood 
Boulevard District. 
</P>
<P>
The association issued a statement condemning the contract and the 
chamber-sponsored business watch group. It read, in part, that: "The gross 
neglect and deterioration of the (existing) Hollywood Boulevard District over 
so many years is so outrageously scandalous and economically threatening that 
immediate attention and cooperation is demanded from City Councilman (Woo's) 
office, the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles and the Hollywood 
Chamber of Commerce to address and act upon these issues." 
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots improvement association, which claims dozens of members, met 
again Thursday night to determine specific program objectives. The group said 
it wants to improve an area from La Brea Avenue to Gower Street, and from Yucca 
Street to Selma Avenue, encompassing the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the organizers are members of the Project Area Committee, an elected 
citizens panel that Woo replaced as the advisory body to the city Community 
Redevelopment Agency's $922-million Hollywood redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the group appointed as the new CRA advisory body, the Hollywood 
Community Advisory Council, has changed the meeting times of its executive 
committee to increase community input. The meetings have been moved to the 
second Monday of each month at 6:30 p.m. at the Hollywood Senior Multi-Purpose 
Center, 6501 Fountain Ave.

CONDO Q &amp; A: WHAT DOCUMENTS DO NEW MANAGERS GET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Our homeowners association is just going into its second year. We 
have been frustrated with our management company's lack of follow-up. This is 
the company that we inherited from our developer, and they have given us 
excuses instead of leadership in dealing with the developer. Our new board will 
probably vote to change management companies next month. 
</P>
<P>
What documents and records can we expect to have transferred to the new 
management company? Do the association's records and files belong to the 
management company or to the association? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: All of the association's documents, records and files, including 
contracts, financial statements and correspondence, belong to the association. 
Personnel records should be turned over to the association if employees work 
directly for the association rather than the management company. 
</P>
<P>
You will probably find that the current management company will request that 
someone from the association board of directors be present for the transfer of 
records. Most management companies will have a release form that lists the 
documents that are being transferred. Reputable management companies will be 
very efficient and cooperative during the transition process. 
</P>
<P>
Although you didn't ask for my advice about changing management companies, I 
would suggest that you have a face-to-face meeting with the owner of the 
current management company to discuss your concerns. 
</P>
<P>
During the development phase, the management company is often perceived as 
being on the side of the developer. However, the developer who serves on the 
initial board of directors and the manager must act in the best interests of 
the association, even if the management company is a division of the 
developer's company. 
</P>
<P>
Terminating the current management company should be your last resort. 
Transition to a new company is not always smooth, and there are bound to be 
some problems while the new company is becoming familiar with the association's 
procedures and its members, contractors and vendors. 
</P>
<P>
If you do change management companies, an audit should be performed by an 
independent certified public accountant. Ask for the accountant's advice 
regarding the mangement transition. I recommend closing any bank accounts that 
have the current management company's personnel as signatories, leaving just 
enough funds to cover any outstanding checks that haven't cleared the bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Auditor's Financial Statement Always Late 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know that California law requires that homeowner associations distribute a 
copy of the annual financial statement within 120 days after the close of the 
fiscal year. Our association's board of directors has not complied with this 
for the last two years. They blame the delay on the auditor, and distribution 
has been from one to three weeks late. The board's attitude is, "It's no big 
deal." How important is it that this deadline be respected? 
</P>
<P>
A: The law that you refer to affects associations that have an annual gross 
income exceeding $75,000. There is no penalty, though an owner could file a 
civil action against a board that does not comply with the law. In my opinion, 
being one to three weeks late does not show a flagrant disregard for the law. 
</P>
<P>
I would tend to be more critical of the auditor who accepted the job and then 
could not complete it within the legal time limit. Boards should make this 
deadline a part of the terms of the contract with the auditor. Since this seems 
to be a major concern to you, why not volunteer to serve on the audit committee 
next year and see to it that this report is distributed on time? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buyer Should Examine All Legal Documents 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are thinking about selling our house and purchasing a condominium. We 
would like to see the legal documents and rules and regulations before we buy, 
but our real estate agent says that we will receive them at the close of 
escrow. Is there any way that we can review these documents prior to 
purchasing? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, you should not be shy about demanding to see the declaration of 
covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&amp;Rs), the bylaws, rules and 
regulations, board meeting minutes, financial statements, annual budget and 
reserve study. Your real estate agent's response was definitely incorrect. The 
escrow closing is not the proper time to receive this important information. 
</P>
<P>
If you sign a purchase agreement prior to receiving the documents that you 
request, the contract should include a clause that gives you 10 days after 
receiving the documents to review the information. You have the right to cancel 
the contract if the legal documents and related information do not meet with 
your approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Complex Means Many Board Duties 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am considering buying a condominium and have wondered about the merits of 
a small association of three to six units versus a large association. I would 
like to have your opinion. 
</P>
<P>
A: If you decide to purchase in a small association be prepared to volunteer 
your time as a working board member. What do I mean by a working board member? 
In a large association, serving on the board may involve merely coming to a 
board meeting once a month to vote on policies and procedures while a 
management company is responsible for the financial operation, maintenance and 
day-to-day affairs of the association. 
</P>
<P>
In a small, self-managed association, each owner should be willing to 
participate in the work of the association, including the accounting, 
maintenance, record-keeping, insurance and other operations. Read the legal 
documents that state the powers and duties of the board and make sure that you 
are willing to participate in some way. 
</P>
<P>
In many very small associations, one overworked individual often does all the 
work, from replacing light bulbs to overseeing contractors, and continues to do 
it simply because none of the other owners will volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as a board member in any size association is a big responsibility 
because of the financial decisions, insurance obligations, rule enforcement and 
record-keeping that are required. In a large association, there is a likelihood 
fo having more volunteers who are willing to serve, whereas in a small one, it 
is very difficult to find volunteers, and they quickly tire of the job because 
of the greater burden of hands-on participation without professional 
management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Should Hire Lawyer to Update Rules 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our association's documents need to be updated. We do not want to pay 
attorney's fees. Where can we purchase a model set of CC&amp;Rs that correlates 
with current laws? Would we be able to obtain another association's documents 
that we could adapt for our association? 
</P>
<P>
A: I am not aware of any "boiler-plate" documents that you could copy, and I 
certainly would not recommend that approach. The amendment process is one that 
requires the expertise and guidance of an attorney who is knowledgeable about 
all the recent changes in community association law. For example, there have 
been recent changes in federal law which make restrictions against children 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Associations that wish to amend their documents should first determine that it 
will be possible to get the approval fo the required percentage of owners. 
After the board has determined the changes that are necessary, then consult 
with your attorney who will prepare the wording of the proposed changes and 
assist with the notification of members for the vote. If the amendment is 
approved, it must be recorded with the county. 
</P>
<P>
I do not understand why association boards are unwilling to consult with 
attorneys when the need arises. Board members are not expected to know all the 
answers. They should be willing to pay for expert help which will often prevent 
costly problems arising at a later date. By relying on professionals, the board 
is reducing their liability. 
</P>
<P>
If you are concerned about the cost, discuss this during the initial 
consultation and see if the attorney will do the work for a flat fee or at 
least give you a "not-to-exceed" estimate of the total cost. Request a monthly 
billing statement so that you can keep track of the cost as the work 
progresses.

COMMERCIAL SCENE: STAFF CUTS, PUBLICITY ADD TO BROKERAGE'S WOES; 
</P>
<P>
COLDWELL BANKER: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE FIRM CONSOLIDATING OFFICES, WITHDRAWING 
FROM MANAGEMENT OF 25% OF PROPERTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN, Galperin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who has 
covered the commercial real estate scene for several years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Managing change is never easy -- especially when it involves cutting staff. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Coldwell Banker Commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the real estate market is already a bit unsettled. Coldwell Banker's 
firing of 90 property management staffers has only helped fuel speculation that 
a shakeout is near for overextended and undercapitalized real estate brokers 
and managers. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that actually happens has yet to be seen, but in the meantime, Coldwell 
Banker is reeling from bad publicity. The company's biggest problem was a false 
report that ran in the Daily News last month asserting that Coldwell Banker 
would shutter three Los Angeles offices. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Coldwell Banker is in the process of consolidating only its property 
management services from 26 offices to 10 regions and four districts 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
When the story broke, Coldwell Banker's phones starting ringing off the hook 
with clients asking for an explanation of the impending disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a failure to communicate," lamented Coldwell Banker executive Jesse 
Harrill. "One of our executives talked about closing offices, when he meant 
property management operations." 
</P>
<P>
The story was subsequently corrected by the Daily News and an alternative 
perspective on the "restructuring" was also written to placate Coldwell Banker 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
This public relations nightmare has yet to run its course, though. Several 
pink-slipped Coldwell Banker employees are telling the real estate community 
that the company is in trouble. And competitors have been quick to comment 
about how even the mighty can fall. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only 90 of Coldwell Banker's 390 property management staffers are 
getting the ax nationally. Most of the company's 5,000 employees work in 
brokerage and their jobs are not in jeopardy, Harrill said.. 
</P>
<P>
He also denied rumors that the company is suffering because of $237.7 million 
in debt taken on last year when management led a buyout of the company from 
Sears. 
</P>
<P>
Employees have a 40% equity stake in the re-created company, but interest 
payments on the debt can be especially onerous as the real estate industry 
faces tighter times. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, Coldwell Banker plans to give up managing about 20 million square 
feet of commercial space, or about 25% of the space it's been servicing. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the company expects to hand other property management companies 3 
million square feet, leaving a management portfolio of about 9 million square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this reorganization, say Coldwell Banker executives, is to 
concentrate on institutional-grade properties, rather than bother with smaller 
and less high-profile projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Property management is still an integral part of Coldwell Banker management," 
maintained Charles McBride, executive vice president and chief operating 
officer. "As part of the company's overall strategic plan we're concentrating 
on larger properties." 
</P>
<P>
But, just as Coldwell Banker strives to build a bigger portfolio of 
institutional buildings under its purview, the company suffered a disappointing 
setback in Burbank recently. 
</P>
<P>
Homart Development Co. picked Cushman &amp; Wakefield of California over 
Coldwell Banker to handle leasing for the first phase of a 
1-million-square-foot office and retail complex planned for the heart of 
Burbank's Media District. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Sears Financial Network, Homart has longtime ties with 
Coldwell Banker and utilizes Coldwell Banker Commercial's brokerage services 
nationwide. Coldwell Banker Commercial Realty Advisors is also providing 
pension fund financing for Homart's $150-million Glendale City Center office 
complex under construction on Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Homart's decision last month to award Cushman &amp; Wakefield the 
opportunity to earn as much as $1 million in lease commissions at Burbank came 
as such a surprise to Coldwell Banker brokers. 
</P>
<P>
They've been working with Homart for more than a year on market projections and 
business development that is usually a prelude to being named exclusive agent 
for a building. 
</P>
<P>
Rumor has it that Homart's Chairman Michael Gregoire was less than pleased to 
hear that one of Coldwell's recent firing casualties was brother Tim Gregoire. 
The brothers Gregoire and Coldwell Banker deny any connection between Tim's 
firing and Homart's untimely split with Coldwell Banker at Burbank, but 
speculation persists. 
</P>

469-Room Hotel Rising on Bunker Hill Site 
</P>
<P>
Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles is soon to be home to a new $100-million 
Inter-Continental Hotel at 251 S. Olive St. Work on the 17-story, 469-room 
hotel started this month and completion is expected in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is being developed by California Plaza Hotel L.P., a limited 
partnership consisting of Bunker Hill Associates and Toboshima Development Co. 
as general partners and Nippon Landic USA Inc. and Seiyo Corp. as limited 
partners, in collaboration with the city's Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Bunker Hill Associates is backed by Metropolitan Structures West Inc., 
developers of California Plaza, which covers 11.5 acres, and when completed in 
the mid-1990s, will include three office towers in addition to 750 residential 
units and the Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgeport Development Co. has completed the first phase of Irvine Oaks 
Executive Park -- a $50-million office and retail project within the Irvine 
Spectrum. The developer plans a total of 20 buildings at Irvine Oaks, ranging 
in size from 6,250 to 40,325 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is under way on the third and final phase of College Business 
Park, a 26-acre office and industrial complex near the Claremont Colleges. The 
$23-million project is being built by Hazama/Mat West Investment Group, a joint 
venture between the Mat West Co. of Van Nuys and Hazama Inc. of Tokyo. The 
final phase at College Business Park will add 129,600 square feet to the 
center's current 184,700 square feet; completion is set for January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont Development Co. will soon begin construction on the 35-acre Rancho 
Business Center industrial development within the Rancho Los Amigos Medical 
Complex. The $22-million project will include 640,000 square feet of commercial 
space, including a facility leased by Kirk Paper through leasing agent the 
Charles Dunn Co. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont has leased the land for this development from Los Angeles County for 66 
years. Officials estimate that this project will generate between $600 million 
and $800 million in public revenues over the term of Fremont's lease. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects in the news include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 24-acre La Mirada Commercecentre, a $20-million project just completed 
by Overton, Moore &amp; Associates and Copley Real Estate Advisors, in 
cooperation with Cox Broadcasting Co. and the city of La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The completion of 4100 Newport Place, a nine-story, $19-million office 
building in Newport Beach by McLachlan Investment Co.

Pasadena-based Colavin Group Inc. principal Sam Longo, on 19.5 acres within the 
238-acre Fontana Commerce Center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, a new look for downtown L.A.'s 40-floor Union Bank Building, which is 
getting a $7-million addition that will feature 11 new retailers when completed 
in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising is moving into its new 
building this month at 9th Street and Grand Avenue on the grounds of a park 
designed to anchor the slowly emerging South Park district of downtown Los 
Angeles. The 180,000-square-foot building stands alongside a planned housing 
project and across the street from the Federal Reserve Bank's local branch. 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;T Development Corp. has broken ground for a 24-story office project at 
8th and Figueroa streets in downtown Los Angeles. The $160-million 801 Tower 
will total 432,000 square feet and be sheathed in pink and green granite. 
R&amp;T is a collaboration of construction company Takenaka Corp. and developer 
Ryoshin Fudosan Co. Ltd., both of Japan.

SALES, LISTINGS JUMP IN S.F. VALLEY IN MAY; 
</P>
<P>
MARKET: REALTY BOARD REPORTS MAY SALES HOT FOR HOMES COSTING UNDER $300,000. 
HIGHER-PRICED HOMES GOING MORE SLOWLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of existing homes in the San Fernando Valley increased 5.1% in May, while 
homeowners continued to list their property for sale in record numbers, the 
Valley Board of Realtors reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
The board reported a total of 1,221 sales of single-family homes and 
condominiums, up 59 sales from the 1,162 reported in April. 
</P>
<P>
"The single-most important factor influencing sales activity is affordability," 
said Becky Roberts, president of California's largest local board of realtors. 
"Sales remain hot for properties priced under $300,000. The higher you go from 
that figure, the softer the market gets." 
</P>
<P>
That means people are still clamoring to get into housing, Roberts said, but it 
also means there are limits on how much prospective buyers will pay, especially 
when the selection of homes for sale is the largest in the history of the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,952 owners listed their property for sale during May, up 16.2% from 
a year ago and up 13.9% from April. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors reported a record 13,561 active 
listings, an increase of 8.5% from April and up 56% from the 8,695 active 
listings of May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Even as an unprecedented buyers' market has emerged, the price of properties 
sold during May remained high, although signs of softening in prices have begun 
to turn up in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of single-family homes sold last month was $306,400, up 6.6% 
from a year ago and up 1.1% over the April average. The condo average resale 
price was $153,100, down 0.2% from last year and up 2.8% from April. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect prices to continue moving up, but at today's much slower rate," said 
Jim Link, the board's executive vice president. "Remember, from 1988 through 
1989, monthly increases in the average price of 20% and 25% were normal. Those 
days are gone." 
</P>
<P>
Link cautioned owners not to base the asking price of their home on monthly 
averages, but to do a careful analysis of their property compared to other 
properties currently on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"With so much to choose from, buyers are being extremely selective," Link said. 
"Some buyers can walk over the threshold and tell instantly that a home is 
overpriced. If you really want to sell -- especially if you're asking more than 
$300,000 -- you better be realistic in your pricing and ready to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
The market today is comparable, Link said, to the market of 1986 and 1987, the 
more normal years before the boom. The only major difference is that 
condominium sales and lower-priced single-family homes lead the market. In 
1987, single-family homes grabbed most of the sales while condos lagged behind. 
</P>
<P>
"That's further evidence that if prices on homes were more affordable, 
especially in the trade-up price ranges, there would be more sales," Link said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,221 sales last month, 882 were single-family homes and 339 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Fully 65% of the single-family home sales were priced under $300,000. The most 
popular price range was from $200,000 to $250,000, which represented 22.3% of 
the total, board statistics indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Sales dropped off with each step up the price category, Link said: 75 homes 
sold at a price between $300,000 and $350,000; 64 from $350,000 to $400,000; 40 
sales from $400,000 to $450,000; 23 sales from $450,000 to $500,000; 71 sales 
from $500,000 to $800,000; and only 32 sales of homes priced over $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
The same trend was even more evident for condominiums. Nearly 99% of all condos 
sold last month went for under $300,000. There were only five sales at a price 
over that figure. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular price range for condos was from $120,000 to $140,000, a price 
range that captured nearly 23% of all condo sales.

JIM MURRAY: THE VAMPIRE STRIKES BACK 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MEDINAH, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as they were about to put a lily on its chest and dump it in the Chicago 
River or bury it out behind a cornfield, Medinah on Saturday got up out of its 
coffin like Dracula and began to bite people in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
Just as we were beginning to think it was two guys in a gorilla suit or a 
dragon made out of papier-mache and a smoke machine, it turned out to be the 
real article. 
</P>
<P>
The real Medinah stood up and began to kick, and there was terror in the 
fairways. All those insolent kids who were taking liberties with the old 
course, pulling its hair, tweaking its nose and making fun of it behind its 
back, were suddenly running for their golf lives and looking for a bed to hide 
under. 
</P>
<P>
It brought the gaudy front-runners back to the field in carload lots. It let 
the marquee names back in the tournament. It taught the upstarts a lesson. It 
got tired of being tormented. 
</P>
<P>
Medinah has fangs. 
</P>
<P>
Take the 17th hole. On the face of it, this is a benign parcel of real estate, 
a bucolic retreat, a nice place to fish or skinny-dip or have a barbecue. It's 
green and leafy. It's not even a particularly dangerous-looking par-three. It's 
only 168 yards and, while it has water for most of that, it looks just like a 
nice smooth seven-iron and one or two putts. Easy three. 
</P>
<P>
Hah! Don't kid yourself. It's like the choir boy who turns out to be an ax 
murderer. The water comes right up to the front part of the green, and it's 
full of drowned golf balls -- and pars. The green slopes from back to front. 
</P>
<P>
This hole turned the U.S. Open into a U.S. Open Saturday, just as key players 
were beginning to disparage the event as "a Memphis Open" (Andy Bean) or "The 
Anheuser-Busch" (Peter Jacobsen). 
</P>
<P>
It first ambushed a little British player, one Ian Woosnam. Ian might be 
leading the Open by two shots if he could have figured a way to play No. 17. He 
came up to it Friday, jockeying for the lead, when he hit his tee shot to the 
left of the green. And the next thing he knew, it took him five strokes to 
negotiate the last 40 feet to the hole. Triple-bogey six. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Woosnam came to 17 five under -- and he hit his tee shot in the water 
in the front of the green. Before he got through, he made double-bogey. He had 
played a par-three in 11 shots in two days. It took him out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Simpson had the U.S. Open squarely in his golf bag when he came up to No. 
17 Saturday. He was eight under par, the field was staggering into a swamp 
behind him, and it looked as if all he had to do to win his second Open was 
stay conscious. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Simpson is a curious specimen for a golfer. Unflappable, good-humored, 
Scott is as patient as a guy waiting for a bus in the Sahara Desert. Simpson 
goes after a course like a guy who has come to do the windows or fix the 
plumbing. He just tries to win its confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Scott is the kind of guy who, if he were in a card game, he'd fold two pair. If 
he was a pitcher and Jose Canseco came up, he'd walk him. If he heard a noise 
in the attic, he'd call the cops, not get a gun. If he had a plane to catch, 
he'd be there two hours early. 
</P>
<P>
He plays layup golf. If he hits it in the trees, he bunts it out and starts 
over. Arnold Palmer might try to hit it through a building, but Scott Simpson 
deals in the possible. 
</P>
<P>
He's a very good golfer, one of the best when the money's high and the course 
is tough. He plays Scott Simpson's game, not Seve Ballesteros'. He's a 
percentage player. The worst he ever makes is a bogey. And not many of them. He 
could par Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
That's why he won an Open. Beating Tom Watson and Ballesteros, no less. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't remember the last time he made triple-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
He can now. He made it Saturday. On No. 17 at Medinah. Dracula's Fangs. 
</P>
<P>
Within two holes of going in the clubhouse as the leader going into the final 
round, Scott studied No. 17. He calibrated the trigonometry. The wind had come 
up. It made the tee shot a bit of a crapshoot. 
</P>
<P>
You didn't want to be behind the hole in that yawning bunker. But you didn't 
want to go in the water. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Simpson hit a seven-iron. It easily cleared the water. But it also went 
in the trap. No man's land. No-shot land. If you hit a normal trap shot -- duck 
soup for a pro -- the ball rolls off the green and possibly into the water. The 
green is like a barn roof. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson tried to hit a shot -- sideways -- that would land in the fringe and 
stop there to let him putt, gingerly, for the hole. 
</P>
<P>
It's brain surgery. It calls for a scalpel, not a sand iron. Simpson cut it too 
fine and the ball trickled back down in the trap. His next shot, he tried the 
other side of the green. The ball rolled down the slope but stopped in the 
fringe in front of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
From there, he took three shots to get it in the hole. Triple-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Visibly shaken, he played 18 like a man who had just heard a tombstone talk. He 
bogeyed it. 
</P>
<P>
He had now gone from nine under par to four under in three holes. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott Simpson does something only one other pro -- Jack Nicklaus -- might 
be expected to do: He comes in the press tent to explain his troubles, 
patiently and uncomplainingly for the assembled reporters. 
</P>
<P>
A five-over finish might tempt most golfers to set fire to the press tent 
before they'd set foot in it. Scott Simpson took the thorns with the roses. "I 
talk about 'contentment' on the golf course when I'm winning, (so) I thought 
I'd better be willing to talk about it when I'm losing," he explained 
cheerfully. It impressed a lot of cynical chroniclers. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 put Medinah back in the tournament and the tournament back in a contest. 
When the day started, it looked like a walk in the park for Tim Simpson (nine 
under) or Jeff Sluman (eight under) or Mike Donald (seven under). The star 
names were either on their way home or in the back of the bus. The leader board 
looked like a satellite tournament in Tupelo, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
When No. 17 got through (Tim Simpson bogeyed there, as did Mark Brooks and many 
other contenders) it looked like a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange was back in the tournament. So was Jack Nicklaus, Fuzzy Zoeller, 
Greg Norman, Nick Faldo -- the ticket-sellers. Thirty-one golfers are within 
five shots of the lead, 27 within four shots. 
</P>
<P>
I can't wait till they get to No. 17 today. I think someone should keep an eye 
on that hole. I think it turns into a bat at midnight. They should have driven 
a stake through its heart when they had the chance earlier in the week.

GAME OF CATCH IS WON BY MARTINEZ, DODGERS, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the trappings of a near-full Dodger Stadium and a national television 
audience, Saturday's baseball game came down to a couple of guys playing catch. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger pitcher Ramon Martinez was on one end, catcher Mike Scioscia was on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
When Martinez struggled, Scioscia calmed him. When Martinez fooled with his 
motion, Scioscia fixed it. 
</P>
<P>
For nine innings they played catch with such togetherness that the San Diego 
Padres could only watch. The Padres scored two runs on four hits in the first 
three innings, but not did not get another hit off Martinez. A seventh-inning 
home run by Scioscia capped the Dodgers' 5-2 victory before 36,819. 
</P>
<P>
While much of the Dodger spotlight this summer has been focused on Martinez and 
his climb toward stardom, Saturday's game proved that he is not making that 
trip alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was like what Ramon has said to me before," teammate Jose Gonzalez said 
after the Dodgers broke a five-game losing streak. "He has done well this year 
because Scioscia has driven him real good. Scioscia has been there with him 
every turn. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like driving on a freeway. If you've never driven anywhere, you go 
crazy. Ramon was like that. Scioscia has kept him going straight." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's performance could help Martinez go straight to his first All-Star 
game next month, not to mention helping Scioscia's chances of joining him. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez retired the last 14 Padre hitters, only two Padres getting on base -- 
via walks -- after a two-run single by Joe Carter with one out in the third 
inning. He finished with eight strikeouts, increasing his National 
League-leading total to 102. He improved to 7-3 with a 2.78 earned-run average 
and is 6-0 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And with each victory, he gets more excited. On Saturday, during his customary 
tossing of the game ball into the stands behind the dugout after a 
complete-game victory, he tried, in vain, to throw it into the orange seats in 
the second deck. It was his only wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't many times you are going to strike out 18 batters, so a game like 
this gives me confidence," said Martinez, referring to his earlier Dodger 
record-tying strikeout performance against Atlanta. "Scioscia, he helps me with 
that confidence. He calls the pitches. He tells me exactly what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia also seems to know exactly what Martinez needs. With the Dodgers 
trailing, 2-1, after Carter's league-leading 53rd and 54th RBIs in the third, 
Scioscia helped end the outburst by throwing out Carter when he attempted to 
steal third. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the inning, Scioscia coaxed a walk from Padre starter and 
loser Mike Dunne. He kept alive a threat that was capped with an RBI single by 
Mike Sharperson and an RBI grounder by Alfredo Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia then hit his seventh homer to start the seventh inning against 
reliever Calvin Schiraldi. He has already hit more homers than in seven of his 
previous nine full seasons. With 25 RBIs, he is also on a pace for a 
career-high in that category. 
</P>
<P>
But as any Dodger will tell you, he has been most valuable working with 
Martinez. That is, any Dodger but Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
"People actually said that about me?" Scioscia said after being told of several 
post-game compliments. "Hey, I'm not going to take credit for that guy. He 
could throw to a brick wall." 
</P>
<P>
The statistics, then, will probably surprise Scioscia even more. He has caught 
10 of Martinez' 13 starts. During that time, Martinez is 6-2 with a 2.17 ERA. 
When not caught by Scioscia, he is 1-1 with a 5.29 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"Scioscia is a great handler of pitchers. . . . I talk to a lot of managers, 
and they always compliment him," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "I know when 
I pitched, I didn't care if my catcher hit the ball out of the infield. I just 
wanted him to do my thinking for me. 
</P>
<P>
"And Mike is great at the retention of his pitchers strengths and weaknesses, 
and the same for opponents." 
</P>
<P>
Both Martinez and Scioscia played like All-Stars in the early innings Saturday. 
Carter singled, Jack Clark was hit by a pitch and Mike Pagliarulo walked to 
load the bases with none out in the second inning. But Scioscia noticed a flaw 
in Martinez's delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw me dropping my arm, so for the rest of the game, he would move his arm 
behind the plate to remind me," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
He escaped the jam by striking out Mark Parent, getting Joey Cora on a fly out, 
and striking out Mike Dunne. Carter put him back in trouble in the third inning 
by following an error by Eddie Murray and an infield single by Roberto Alomar 
with a bloop, two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
But with runners on first and third and one out, Scioscia threw out Carter and 
Pagliarulo hit a grounder back to the mound to end the inning. At that point, 
in three innings, Martinez had thrown 71 pitches. He was so dominant in the 
final six innings, he threw only 74 more. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Juan Samuel, hitless in his last 30 at-bats, was benched Saturday and could 
remain on the sidelines for several days. Lenny Harris was moved to second base 
and Mike Sharperson played third despite the presence of right-handed Padre 
starter Mike Dunne. Sharperson responded with an RBI single. "I think (Samuel) 
needs to sit down for some games, get himself back together," Dodger Manager 
Tom Lasorda said. "You could tell he is really, really trying. Maybe it would 
be better for him if he just watched for a while." Samuel's infield partner 
Alfredo Griffin had just one hit in his last 28 at-bats, but he is still the 
only Dodger to appear in each of the team's 62 games. Samuel is batting .207 
while Griffin is batting .243. . . . Hubie Brooks was sidelined for a third 
consecutive game Saturday because of a sore right wrist that he said will take 
a few more days to heal. Brooks said he hurt the wrist last month, but 
continued to play. He said doctors told him the wrist contained calcium 
deposits, but that the injury is probably not disabling. Stan Javier had a 
single and an RBI in Brooks' place Saturday, making him four-for-13 with a home 
run, a double and three RBIs since taking over in right field three games ago.

BIG WIN FOR TEAM KERSEE; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE USES HER COACH'S ADVICE FOR A 23-2 3/4 
LONG JUMP. BELL CLEARS 18-10 IN THE POLE VAULT. 
</P>

<P>
During a lull in the women's long jump competition at the USA/Mobil National 
Track and Field Championships, Jackie Joyner-Kersee went over to the railing 
that separates the track from the stands to talk to Bob Kersee, her 
husband/coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He said I had to concentrate on pushing through my marks, accelerating, 
lifting and holding my extension," Joyner-Kersee said. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee followed his advice on her next jump and leaped 23 feet 2 3/4 
inches to win Saturday at Cerritos College. Joyner-Kersee's jump was the best 
by an American this year and the second best jump in the world this year. Only 
Inessa Kravetz of the Soviet Union has jumped farther (23-3 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm was very pleased with the distance, but I wasn't pleased with my 
mechanics," she said. "I think it came because the run was OK, but I was able 
to ride the jump and hold my extension longer." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee's jump was extraordinary considering that she jumped into a 
headwind of 2.6 meters per second. She had passed once before her winning jump 
because of the wind. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Echols, who finished second with a leap of 22-2 1/4, was impressed with 
Joyner-Kersee's winning jump. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was incredible into that wind," Echols said. "You have to put 
the wind aside because if you think about it, it will take you out of what you 
came to do. I heard a lot of girls complaining about it, but we have no control 
over that. I was just hoping it would cease when I got ready to jump." 
</P>
<P>
A former world record-holder in the long jump, Joyner-Kersee said she would 
like to regain the world mark, which is held by Galina Chistyakova of the 
Soviet Union at 24-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
"I really love the long jump and that's my best event," she said. "I've learned 
that I really don't have to concentrate on going after the world record for the 
long jump because if I prepare myself, then I believe it will come. There have 
been times when I really thought I was in shape and tried to go after it, and I 
put too much pressure on myself and ended up not jumping well at all." 
</P>
<P>
Kersee said Joyner-Kersee is capable of surpassing her world heptathlon record 
of 7,291 points at the Goodwill Games next month in Seattle. The Goodwill Games 
organizers have offered incentives of $15,000 to anyone who sets a world record 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's realistic to expect a world record at the Goodwill Games," Kersee 
said. "I looked at it last night and, I'm going to go ahead and shout it out 
right now because I'm the husband around here: I figure her at 7,299 to 7,312 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"But Jackie and I have never gone after world records for money. We go after 
world records because we want to accomplish something that is difficult. And if 
we set a world record, the money isn't going to be the incentive. We're going 
to keep chasing world records until it's time to retire and start working on a 
couple other little Bob Kersees and Jackie Joyner-Kersees." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Johnson of Baylor, the NCAA champion at 200 meters, blew away the field 
in that event, winning in 19.90, the fastest time in the world this year. It 
was the fifth fastest time ever by an American, and it ranks seventh on the 
all-time world list. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I ran the curve real well, but I usually run the curve well," 
Johnson said. "The past few races I've had trouble focusing on the finish line 
coming down the straight, but today it felt real smooth coming down the 
straight and I think that was the key to the performance I turned in today." 
</P>
<P>
Was he surprised by his time? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. "I felt the times I've run the past couple weeks would bring me 
to a good time about this time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Everett finished second with a personal best of 20.08. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Bell, 34, became a three-decade winner in the national championships, 
taking the pole vault at 18-10. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a three-time Olympian and a Games' bronze medalist in 1984, won his first 
national title in 1976 and his second in 1984, when he became the first 
American to clear 19 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, after clinching the title, he missed three times at a 
meet-record 19-0 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In the biggest upset on the final day of national championships, Janeene 
Vickers of UCLA held off American record-holder Sandra Farmer-Patrick to win 
the women's 400-meter hurdles in 54.80 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
David Patrick, Farmer-Patrick's husband, came from behind to win the men's 
400-meter hurdles for the second consecutive year in 48.79. He passed Kevin 
Young (49.56), a former UCLA star, and USC's George Porter (49.77) in the 
stretch and held them off at the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Steve Lewis, the 1988 Olympic gold medalist in the 400 meters, won the 
400 in 44.75 and Maicel Malone won the women's 400 in 51.23. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Everett, who won the NCAA 800-meter title earlier this month while at 
Florida, came from behind to win the 800 in 1:45.01. Fourth with 300 meters to 
go, Everett made his move on the final turn, passing leader Octavius Clark in 
the final straightaway to win his second national title in the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm a bit of a crowd-pleaser because of the way I run (from behind)," 
Everett said. "The crowd can never tell whether I'm going to make it or not." 
</P>
<P>
After clearing 6-5 to win the women's high jump, Yolanda Henry had the bar 
raised to 6-8 1/4, which would have surpassed Louise Ritter's American record 
of 6-8 set in 1988. Although Henry was close on all three jumps, she failed to 
break the record. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me confident that I can get the record some time soon," she said. "I'm 
in shock right now. I started jumping terribly, but after I cleared 6-4 on my 
first jump, I felt better. But I'm surprised that I won because of the way I 
started jumping today." 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mary Slaney, U.S. record-holder in the women's 1,500, didn't run the 1,500 
final after qualifying for it on Friday. Slaney, however, hopes to be named to 
compete in the Goodwill Games. . . . Ken Flax, who won the hammer with a throw 
of 249-6, was nervous before the meet. "I was real careful driving here this 
morning on the freeway," Flax said. "Then when I got into the stadium parking 
lot, I sped up, passed a stop sign and got pulled over by two big cops. I 
blamed it on pre-meet nerves." Flax doesn't have a coach. "But at the end of 
the second year of coaching myself, I feel totally self-sufficient. I had 
contractors build a ring in a vacant lot north of San Francisco and I work by 
myself."

A WIDE OPEN TIGHTENS UP; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: BROWN AND DONALD LEAD, BUT 27 ARE WITHIN FOUR SHOTS, INCLUDING STRANGE, 
FALDO AND NICKLAUS.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday is called moving day on the pro golf tour, the third round when 
players move into contention on the leader board. 
</P>
<P>
There was movement Saturday in the 90th U.S. Open at Medinah Country Club but 
in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-hole leaders backed up, others closed in and, going into today's final 
round, 27 players are within four shots of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Donald and Billy Ray Brown became the 54-hole leaders at 209, seven under, 
when Tim Simpson, the 36-hole leader, faltered along with Jeff Sluman, Hale 
Irwin and Scott Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
It's a crowd at the top now as Larry Nelson, Mark Brooks, Tim Simpson and 
Sluman are only one shot behind Donald and Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Six other other players are grouped at 211 -- Curtis Strange, Mike Reid, 
Australia's Craig Parry, Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal, Fuzzy Zoeller and Larry 
Mize. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Simpson is grouped with six others, including two-time Masters champion 
Nick Faldo, at 212. Jack Nicklaus heads a group at 213. 
</P>
<P>
Strange, who is trying to become the first player to win three consecutive U.S. 
Opens since Willie Anderson achieved the feat in 1903-1905, barely made the cut 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After playing his morning round, in which he shot a four-under-par 68, Strange 
said the Medinah course was "pretty defenseless." 
</P>
<P>
He made that evaluation on a humid, overcast day because the greens were still 
holding shots and there wasn't much wind. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman, who had a 69 for a two-under 214 total while also playing in the 
morning, said the tournament really stopped Wednesday night when a rainstorm 
dampened the slick greens, slowing them up so there were more birdie 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, Medinah got its revenge as the wind kicked up and the 
pressure of the U.S. Open got to some of the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Take Scott Simpson. He was nine under with a one-shot lead going to the 16th 
hole. He bogeyed 16 and then self-destructed at the par-three, 168-yard 17th, a 
hole that has frustrated others. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson triple-bogeyed and added a bogey at the par-four, 440-yard 18th hole. 
So he lost five shots to par on the last three holes, finishing with a 73. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Simpson was only one shot behind Scott Simpson at the 16th hole. Tim 
Simpson took a bogey there, plus another at No. 17, and wound up with a 
three-over-par 75. 
</P>
<P>
Sluman, who had no bogeys for the first 36 holes and was only one shot behind 
Tim Simpson at the outset of the third round, struggled most of the day and 
came in with a 74. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin, who was four shots out of lead after Friday's round, also had a 74. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a productive day for the final six groups Saturday. Brown had the 
only sub-par round of the 12 golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Donald, who was two strokes behind Tim Simpson after 36 holes, played par golf. 
He didn't make a birdie on the back nine, had one bogey at No. 12, but he's 
still the co-leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the field reacted like it was the U.S. Open and backed off," 
Donald said. "As it turned out, par was a pretty good score." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 27, playing in his first U.S. Open, did even better. He shot a 
three-under-par 69. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really expected to be in this position in my first U.S. Open," said 
the 6-foot-3, 195-pound Brown. "I am trying to savor the moment and enjoy it. 
I'm feeling the heat already and it's not tomorrow yet." 
</P>
<P>
Brown is in his third year on the tour. He won the NCAA championship as a 
freshman at the University of Houston in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
His best finish is a tie for second in the Kemper Open in 1989. He has had five 
top-10 finishes in 14 tour events this year. 
</P>
<P>
He had failed to qualify for four previous Opens. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has played like a veteran here with three sub-par rounds, 69, 71 and 69. 
With others faltering, he charged into contention on the back nine with birdies 
at the 10th, 11th and 13th holes, but had a bogey at No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't realize he was the co-leader until he was walking up the 18th 
fairway. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's father, Charlie, was a lineman for the Oakland Raiders in 1962 and his 
brother, Chuck, played for the football St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who lives in Missouri City, Tex., said he played football until his 
sophomore year in high school before switching to golf. 
</P>
<P>
The young pro has become friendly with Curtis Strange, and he and his wife had 
dinner with Strange Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a guy with something to prove," Brown said of Strange. "I could see it in 
his eyes at dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Strange, who had four birdies in a bogey-free round, said he's fired up now. 
</P>
<P>
He is two strokes out of the lead and he was three back last year at Rochester, 
N.Y., when he defended his Open championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I was in the lead, but I feel a good last round could put me close and 
possibly shake somebody," Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
When Strange was in the interview tent, Scott Simpson was still on the course 
and leading at nine under. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott is a proven Open champion (1987 at the Olympic Club in San Francisco)," 
Strange said. "He's a good striker of the ball, a good putter and good thinker. 
He's a guy who will be tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Simpson started beating himself on the last three holes. He 
opened the door for others with his collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more like Homer Simpson (the cartoon character), beat down," Simpson 
said as he came into the interview area. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure Curtis is not shedding any tears for me. He is right back in it and 
has pretty good memories of the U.S. Open," Simpson said.

An early evening thunderstorm with flashes of lightning drenched the Medinah 
course after play was completed. There is a 40% chance of more rain today with 
winds forecast from 10 to 20 m.p.h. . . . Jack Nicklaus shot a four-under-par 
68. He might even be closer to the lead if he played the par-five holes better. 
He's one over par on the par-fives for three rounds. Nicklaus played in the 
morning and he didn't particularly like it. "The nice thing about the Senior 
Tour is that you get to play late every day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Records were set Friday for the most sub-par scores in the second round (47) 
and for 36 holes (86). The previous second-round record was 24 at Oakland Hills 
(Birmingham, Mich.) in 1985 and the Olympic Club in 1985. The previous 36-hole 
record was 64 at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., in 1988. The lowest 
36-hole cut record was tied at 145. The cut was at 145 last year at Oak Hill 
Country Club in Rochester. However, par there was 70 compared to 72 at Medinah.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ATHLETICS LEAVE NO DOUBT IN CHICAGO, 12-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After nearly falling into second place Friday night, the Oakland Athletics 
wasted no time in dispensing with the White Sox Saturday night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics scored seven times in the first inning and, after a one-hour rain 
delay in the sixth inning, romped to a 12-3 victory to build their lead in the 
American League West to three games. 
</P>
<P>
Another sellout crowd of 44,176 at Comiskey Park had little to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
A two-run double by Doug Jennings was the first big hit off Melido Perez (6-5), 
who gave up five hits and seven runs in two-thirds of an inning, his shortest 
stint of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were well aware of the way Perez had been pitching," Manager Tony La Russa 
of the Athletics said. "But something like this can happen to anyone. We just 
got to him before he could establish himself. It was just one of those days." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Steinbach, who singled in a run in the first inning, hit a two-run home 
run and Rickey Henderson also homered. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sanderson (8-3) went eight easy innings and improved his road record to 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox won the first game of the four-game series Thursday to pull 
within a game of the lead in the American League West. Then, they were five 
outs away from taking over first place Friday when the Athletics rallied in the 
eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
With Saturday's game out of hand, Manager Jeff Torborg rested his bullpen and 
brought in utilityman Steve Lyons to pitch. Lyons gave up a run and two hits in 
two innings. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out newcomer Steve Howard, who was making his first appearance after 
the Athletics traded away designated hitter Ken Phelps to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was the biggest for the White Sox, playing their last season in 
Comiskey Park, since the 1983 League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Baltimore 3 -- Winner Mike Boddicker (8-3) struck out seven and gave 
up seven hits -- four by Phil Bradley -- in eight innings at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been using my fastball and getting a lot of outs with it, " Boddicker 
said. "I'm getting after it. If I could have handled Bradley, it would have 
been an easy outing. I hit some pretty decent spots." 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs, hitless in 13 previous at-bats, had three hits, including his 
fourth home run, for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, battling for first place in the East, have won 10 of their last 14 
games. The Orioles have lost four in a row, all at home. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 10, Milwaukee 9 -- The Brewers had a 7-2 lead in the eighth inning at 
Cleveland, blew the lead, came back to tie, then lost it when first baseman 
Greg Brock argued a call instead of throwing home. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians scored seven runs in the eighth inning, three on rookie Carlos 
Baerga's three-run double, to take a 9-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was 9-9 when Jerry Browne led off the bottom of the ninth with a walk. With 
runners on first and second and one out, Brook Jacoby hit what appeared to be 
an inning-ending double play ball to pitcher Bob Sebra. Sebra threw to second 
but Bill Spiers' throw to first pulled Brock off base. While Brock turned to 
argue, Browne raced home with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"I gambled and I won," Browne said. "I don't think he (Brock) was expecting me 
to go. He was arguing, and by the time he turned around, I was already 
breaking. I was going all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Brock said he tagged Jacoby on the foot. "When I caught his foot and tagged him 
-- between trying to hold onto the ball and thinking he was out -- I hesitated. 
It was just enough." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Molitor had three hits, including two doubles, scored three runs and drove 
in two for the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 5, Minnesota 3 -- The Royals' Danny Tartabull hit a two-run home 
run at Kansas City to extend his hitting streak to nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull has four home runs and eight runs batted in during his streak. The 
Royals have won three in a row and extended the Twins' losing streak to nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 2, New York 1 -- Pat Borders singled in the winning run in the 11th 
inning at New York for the Blue Jays' fifth consecutive victory and ninth in 
their last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Borders hit a line drive to left-center field with two outs to score Rance 
Mulliniks from second base. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Wills (5-2) won in relief as the Yankees lost for the 11th time in the 
last 14 games. DAN HAFNER

BARGAIN BECOMES FREE TICKET, NOT ANOTHER RYAN NO-HITTER

<P>
Although it was "Guaranteed No-Hitter Night" at Seattle, Nolan Ryan of the 
Texas Rangers didn't come close to his seventh no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Reynolds beat out an infield hit to open the third inning Saturday night 
and make sure all the fans who want them can turn in their ticket stubs for a 
$4.50 general admission ticket to a Mariner game against the Angels in the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion lured 37,248, third largest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan gave them a thrill by striking out five in the first two innings. But he 
lost some of his zip in the third and the Texas Rangers were beaten, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Before Ryan pitched his sixth no-hitter last Monday at Oakland, the Mariners 
had already planned the special night. Ticket sales boomed, after the 
43-year-old right-hander pitched his gem against the world champions. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who needs six more victories to reach the 300-victory mark, gave up three 
runs and four hits in five innings. He had nine strikeouts but five walks and 
left trailing, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Young, who lost his no-hit bid in the second inning, pitched his best game 
of the season. He held the Rangers to three hits and improved his record to 
2-7. DAN HAFNER

MIKE DOWNEY: NOTE TO AMERICA: BEWARE OF HOOLIGANS IN WORLD CUP '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEMI, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture yourself living in peaceful Ann Arbor, Mich., in a neighborhood not 
far, perhaps, from the University of Michigan's 104,000-seat stadium, when, one 
otherwise silent night in 1994, your sidewalks and shops and campus corner pubs 
become overrun with drunken, delinquent British soccer fans, in town for a game 
of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
And soon, sirens begin wailing, and Washtenaw County cops begin coming in waves 
to control and collar these mad dogs and Englishmen, and before long some 
night-court judge has every bailiff and deputy in the building busy booking or 
restraining a mob of punks with spiked, purple haircuts and studded, fingerless 
leather gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Or, picture yourself in the general vicinity of the Yale Bowl one quiet 
weeknight in New Haven, Conn., when a whacked-out party of West Germans goes 
wild and loots its way through the streets, smashing windows, accosting 
townies. 
</P>
<P>
Or, possibly you see yourself sitting down to a quiet supper in Palo Alto, 
Calif., when, from the general direction of Stanford Stadium, some 85,000 
spectators are caught in a stampede, touched off by hostile Dutch rowdies, 
incensed by a referee's call. 
</P>
<P>
Hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
That's what they call them in soccer circles. That's what they call them here 
in Italy, where government and law-enforcement authorities have gone crazy 
attempting to keep the peace. Arrests of rioting, rumbling, misbehaving 
tourists, ostensibly here to watch their national teams play soccer, have been 
multiplying day by day since World Cup play began on June 8, with swift-acting 
justices meting out jail sentences ranging in length from six months to two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's disgusting," said Peter Vermes, 23, a New Jersey native playing 
in this tournament for the United States, but also the first American to play 
first-division soccer in Hungary and Holland. "These people are low-lifes. I've 
been exposed to their kind once too often in Europe, and we don't want them 
contaminating the World Cup when it comes to America. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we're ever going to get rid of them is to start disqualifying 
teams from the tournament," Vermes said. "Warn each side that you're going to 
award a forfeit or even throw their country right out of the Cup if they can't 
do something about their fans. That'll get the message across." 
</P>
<P>
If this is not a concern in America now, perhaps it should become one and soon. 
Anywhere from eight to 12 stadiums will be put to use throughout the United 
States in '94, when the World Cup comes there for the first time -- and with 
the tournament comes its followers. Civic and academic officials who have 
volunteered their facilities -- Michigan, Yale and Stanford among them -- might 
wish to think twice after checking out the police blotters of Milan or 
Cagliari, off Italy's coast on the isle of Sardinia. 
</P>
<P>
Riot squads were out in full force Saturday night as Cagliari braced for a Cup 
match between England and the Netherlands, whose respective fans have been 
among the most voluble and violent in soccer. Some believe these two particular 
teams were deliberately "exiled" to first-round games on the island to at least 
minimize the destruction on Italy's mainland. 
</P>
<P>
There has been anxious talk of prearranged rumble sites, complicated by the 
danger of spontaneous, game-related incidents. English fans have been so 
unruly, they are not allowed off the British Isles except for national-team 
competition such as this. The specter of 94 dead after the horrifying Sheffield 
stadium stampede of 1989 is always present, as well as that of the 39 people 
killed at a match between English and Italian teams four years ago in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
English hooligans can be particularly cruel and profane. They taunted German 
fans in Dusseldorf with hateful chants that included: "Drink your beer, rape 
your women." 
</P>
<P>
Another time, at the European championships, the theme of their constant 
baiting of the Germans from the grandstand was their having won "Two World 
Wars, One World Cup." The brawling that ensued after the game was expected and 
almost understandable. 
</P>
<P>
Hooliganism is hardly an English monopoly. The Irish know a thing or two about 
it; the word hooligan itself is taken from an Irishman's name. 
</P>
<P>
At a 1989 World Cup qualifying game, a Brazilian spectator flung a Roman 
candle-style firecracker that so frightened Chile's goalie, he dropped to the 
ground, thinking he had been shot. Three years before, at a Cup qualifier in 
China, dozens were trampled after the unexpected defeat of the host team. At 
least 20 died, and soldiers had to be called in to quell the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
"At a game in Amsterdam that I attended last year, the Ajax team fell behind in 
a shoot-out in overtime, and all hell broke loose," Vermes said. "The fans 
threw objects and stormed the railing. They were warned to stop, and when they 
didn't, a 3-0 forfeit was awarded. That's when things really got bad, and the 
Ajax team ended up being suspended from international play for at least a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
At one point that day, Dutch fans hurled Molotov cocktails -- bottles filled 
with gasoline or lighter fluid and flaming rags -- at others in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"Sickening," Vermes said. 
</P>
<P>
He happens to be a young American who believes in fighting for freedom, not 
over soccer results. Vermes' father escaped Soviet-occupied Hungary in 
November, 1956, being recaptured several times and shot once before fleeing 
successfully and finally making his way to America. Before he defected, Michael 
Vermes played professional soccer for Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"My father would like nothing more than for soccer to become as successful and 
popular in his chosen country as it was in his homeland," Vermes said. 
</P>
<P>
With popularity, though, comes attention and commotion. Proposed World Cup 
sites for 1994 include the Rose Bowl and Coliseum, four Florida football arenas 
and other sites ranging from Chicago's Soldier Field to Dallas' Cotton Bowl, 
from the new Minnesota Sports Complex to even the 32,000-seat Sam Boyd Silver 
Bowl in Las Vegas. Even the Navy-Marine facility at Annapolis, Md., is ready to 
enlist. 
</P>
<P>
They had better know what they could be getting their stadiums into -- and who 
could be getting into their stadiums.

Costa Rican goalie Luis Conejo was a star in his team's World Cup victory over 
Scotland Monday and was nearly as good Saturday against heavily favored Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly. 
</P>
<P>
Muller, Brazil's striker, hooked in a shot that deflected off defender Mauricio 
Montero in the 33rd minute for a 1-0 victory over Costa Rica at Turin, Italy, 
that allowed the Brazilians to advance to the second round from Group C. 
</P>
<P>
Their two victories are worth four points, and they join Cameroon, Italy, 
Czechoslovakia and West Germany among teams that already have clinched 
second-round berths. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has a 1-1 record for two points and remains in the running for the 
second round, as does Scotland, which beat Sweden, 2-1, in the other Group C 
game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica and Sweden meet Wednesday as do Scotland and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians completely dominated the first half, restricting Costa Rica to 
the occasional breakout. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Alemao set the pattern in the first minute, firing a shot just 
inches wide. In the second minute, Careca and Costa Rican defender Roger Gomez 
rose high together and the ball flew off the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
With Branco floating dangerously on the left, the Brazilians launched wave 
after wave of attacks. But they were frustrated by the skills of Conejo. Dunga, 
Valdo, Careca and Branco all had shots that flew either narrowly off target or 
were saved by Conejo. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Ricardo Gomes hit the post with a 48th-minute header, and Valdo sent 
two shots screaming narrowly off target as Costa Rica remained in a defensive 
mode the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
Scotland 2, Sweden 1 -- Scotland made wholesale changes and used them well to 
win at Genoa, Italy, and keep alive their hopes of reaching the second round of 
the World Cup for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Stuart McCall scored from close range in the 11th minute and striker 
Mo Johnston converted a penalty kick to put the game away with eight minutes to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Substitute Glenn Stroemberg scored for Sweden with four minutes left. The 
Swedes, who lost, 2-1, to Brazil in their opener, pressed for the tying goal 
and had two good chances. But goalie Jim Leighton held them off. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tired at the end," Scotland Coach Andy Roxburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
McCall's early goal followed a corner kick by Murdo MacLeod that found David 
McPherson, who headed it on toward McCall. He beat the Swedish defense to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Scotland counterattacked well in the last 20 minutes, and Roy Aitken was 
brought down by Roland Nilsson in the penalty area to set up Johnston's goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We were poor in attack," Sweden Coach Olle Nordin said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden missed its top striker, Mats Magnusson, due to injury but welcomed back 
its best defender, Glen Hysen. But Scotland's changes were more helpful. 
</P>
<P>
It juggled its lineup, pairing McPherson and Craig Levein on defense to give it 
the stability missed in the opening loss to Costa Rica.

Joseph Dumars Jr., father of Detroit Piston guard Joe Dumars, was buried at 
Natchitoches, La., as more than 1,500 people jammed the auditorium, television 
reporters and photographers recorded the event and the procession behind the 
hearse stretched for nearly a mile. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral was two days after the Pistons won their second consecutive NBA 
championship and was attended by Detroit Coach Chuck Daly and about a dozen of 
the team's officials. 
</P>
<P>
No other players attended, general manager Jack McCloskey saying: "We didn't 
want it to turn into a big media event. We didn't want to interfere. We felt if 
they came it would be too much of a TV thing."

U.S. JUNIORS GO TO FRANCE FOR SECOND SUMMIT 
</P>

<P>
International team competition is nothing new to golf. There are the Walker 
Cup, Ryder Cup and Eisenhower Trophy world team matches for men, the Curtis Cup 
and Espirito Santo Trophy world team matches for women. 
</P>
<P>
Now the juniors are going international. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California vs. France junior matches, which began almost by 
accident two years ago at the Alhambra Municipal and Industry Hills courses, 
will be held for the second time, next month in France. Twelve Southland 
juniors, ages 12 to 17, and two PGA professionals, Jerry Herrera of Azusa 
Greens and Dave Smith of the Navy course in Cypress, will leave on June 28 for 
Paris, where the youngsters will play on four courses against a team of French 
juniors. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came about during the Guadalajara Pro-Am in Mexico in early 1988. 
Herrera was in the tournament -- he won it -- and one of his partners was 
Alaine Sarfatti, president of Le Club de la Tour, an organization with offices 
in Paris and Los Angeles. Sarfatti mentioned that his club was sponsoring a 
trip by 12 French juniors to Southern California as a reward for their play, 
and asked Herrera if he knew of some available courses. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an assistant at Alhambra Municipal at the time," Herrera explained, "and 
we had a Christmas tournament scheduled for our own junior program. I suggested 
that he bring the French players and play in it. Then I contacted (pro) Jim 
Porter at Industry Hills and got starting times there. With the help of Porter 
and Dave Allaire of Lakeside and the Southern California Junior Golf Assn., we 
put together a team of our best players and challenged the French kids. 
</P>
<P>
"It took on big-time trappings when Pat Rielly, president of the PGA, put in an 
appearance, and the matches were filmed by a TV crew from France. 
</P>
<P>
"The French kids had such a great time that when they got back to Paris, the 
French golf federation invited us to come over there this year. I've written 
letters to other national federations with the suggestion that they join us in 
the future and maybe have an annual event that moves from country to country, 
like the world team matches." 
</P>
<P>
The 12 Southern California golfers were selected for their play in the Junior 
Golf Assn. Three of them -- Tiger Woods of Cypress, Young Nam of Los Angeles 
and Eddy Lee of Corona -- were members of the 1988 team. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, 14, has won four Junior World age-group championships, and shot a 70-69 
-- 139 on the Balboa and Encino courses to win his age division in the L.A. 
City Junior Championships in April. 
</P>
<P>
Nam, who attends Marshall High, is the City prep champion and winner of the 
1988 Asian junior tournament in Manila. Lee, from Corona High School, is the 
Southern Section prep champion. 
</P>
<P>
Other boys on the team are Chris Tidland, 17, of Placentia, the Los Angeles 
City junior champion; Richard Son, 17, of Fullerton; Scott Richardson, 17, of 
Laguna Niguel; Ben Garner, 14, of El Toro, and Ted Oh, 13, of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The four girls are Heidi Voorhees, 17, of North Hollywood, runner-up in the 
L.A. City junior tournament; Leanne Wong, 15, of Los Angeles, a two-time Junior 
World champion who also won the Korean junior title last December; Allison 
Wilson, 13, of North Hollywood, and Sandie Song, 12, of Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
They will play on July 3 at Le Touquet Golf Club, July 4 at Morfontaine Golf 
Club and July 5-6 at St.-Nom-La-Breteche Golf Club, site of the Lancome Trophy 
matches. They will also watch the final round of the French Open on July 1 at 
the Chantilly course. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, 36, a former Monrovia High, Pasadena City College and UC Santa Barbara 
golfer who became head pro at Azusa Greens in February of 1989, has been the 
catalyst for the matches. His French counterpart, Fred Beauchemp, once gained 
international attention when he crossed the Atlantic Ocean on a sailboard. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine what a trip like this must mean to a teen-ager," Herrera said. 
"I was 12 before I knew what golf really was. An uncle took me to Rancho when I 
was 12 and I saw Arnold Palmer, and right then I decided I wanted to be a 
professional golfer. This opportunity to help establish a union between our 
junior golfers and France has been a unique experience for me. It's like a 
dream come true -- 20 years later." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>

FAVOR WINS 1,500, LOOKS TO THE GOODWILL GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Young boys in baseball caps stood tippy-toed, hoping they would be one of the 
lucky ones to claim her autograph. Athletes gathered to congratulate her, 
shaking their heads in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether Suzy Favor will dominate the U.S. middle-distance 
corps in the future, but Saturday night at the USA/Mobil National Track and 
Field Championships at Cerritos College, the 21-year-old University of 
Wisconsin senior made it clear that she is as talented in the 1,500-meter race 
as any U.S. woman to come along in several years. 
</P>
<P>
Favor, a nine-time NCAA champion and the American junior record-holder at 1,500 
meters, topped an impressive field Saturday night to win in 4 minutes 13.47 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
It was Favor's first title at The Athletics Congress championships. 
</P>
<P>
Claudette Groenendall led the race through 700 meters, then Favor took the 
lead, taking the pack through a 2:23.5 800-meter split. Favor, who won the NCAA 
800 title earlier this month in 1:59.11 and who is known for having a furious 
kick, said the slow pace helped. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace was slow in the beginning," said Favor. "I'm not complaining. That 
makes it better for me." 
</P>
<P>
With about 500 meters to go, Favor, followed closely by PattiSue Plumer, 
unleashed an impressive surge, holding it around the backstretch to where only 
she and Plumer were left to contend. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer, who was outkicked by Favor last summer in a mile race at UCLA, did all 
she could, putting on her usual frantic kick, but Favor was too quick. As 
Plumer chased her through the homestretch, Favor added an extra burst to hold 
her off. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer, who was second in 4:13.68, said: "I don't like to get beat by this 
much, but my coach (Brooks Johnson) told me I ran the last 400 in 56 (actually 
59 seconds). That's my personal record. I think Suzy's as good as they come 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Although Plumer was disappointed with second place, she made up for it just 
over an hour later as she won the 5,000 meters in 15:45.67 -- a performance far 
from her American record of 14:59.99, but impressive in that she held off 
longtime rival Sabrina Dornhoefer in the final 50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"PattiSue's crazy," Favor said with a laugh. "She can do that (double) though." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Favor was the real star Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy with this," Favor said. "This is so exciting. The future . . 
. the Goodwill Games . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Favor, who ran a personal best of 4:08.26 in winning the NCAA title this month, 
was asked if she believes she can become the first American other than Mary 
Slaney to break 4 minutes in the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to. It's a goal of mine," she said. "I think I can -- not this year, 
maybe. But I still have many years ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
Slaney, who ran the slowest qualifying time (4:18.40) in Friday night's 
preliminaries, did not compete in the final. Because she ran at least one race 
at the USA/Mobil meet, however, she will still have a chance to make the U.S. 
Goodwill Games team as an at-large entry. 
</P>
<P>
Favor said competing at the Goodwill Games next month at Seattle has been a 
longtime goal for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about it," she said. "It's a dream of mine. . . . It's a step 
toward the Olympic team and that's a goal of mine."

VICKERS CLEARS A HURDLE; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: SHE UPSETS FARMER-PATRICK DESPITE STUMBLING NEAR THE FINISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Janeene Vickers has excellent speed and is stronger than most women running the 
400-meter hurdles. But in Saturday's finals of the USA/Mobil National Track and 
Field Championships, her role was clear. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Farmer-Patrick, owner of the U.S. record (53.37 seconds), was the star, 
and if all went well, Vickers would push Farmer-Patrick down the stretch and 
finish a close second. 
</P>
<P>
That's what made Vickers' 54.80-second first-place finish, the fourth-fastest 
time by an American, one of the biggest upsets of the three-day meet. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers was followed by Farmer-Patrick (55.10), Schowonda Williams (55.61) and 
Victoria Fulcher (56.06). 
</P>
<P>
According to Vickers' coach, Bob Kersee, the game plan was for Vickers to lead 
at the eighth hurdle, then use her tremendous speed to close out the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'Don't worry about being in a tie with Sandra at the 10th hurdle,' 
" Kersee said. "Nobody can run down Janeene in the last 50 meters." 
</P>
<P>
At least half the game plan worked. 
</P>
<P>
At the eighth hurdle, Vickers led, but she couldn't pull away. In fact, 
Farmer-Patrick was slowly gaining, and as they neared the 10th hurdle, it was 
nearly a dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
But Vickers has a history of problems clearing the 10th hurdle going back to 
her freshman year at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 NCAA championships, Vickers surprisingly took the lead going into 
the 10th hurdle, but blew it when she tensed up and lost her timing -- "I was 
in the lead and I just wanted to take off" -- and fell going over the hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing almost happened again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers stuttered-stepped just before reaching the 10th hurdle, but she cleared 
it without incident, then stumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer-Patrick gained a step and appeared primed for victory. But Vickers 
quickly regained her composure, and with one final burst, outsprinted Patrick 
to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea where she was," Vickers said. "I was just running for my life 
because I knew she was coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she was going to dig down, and the odds were that she was going to 
catch me. You've got to close your eyes and go for it." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was a big one for Vickers, a two-time NCAA champion who will travel 
to the Goodwill Games in Seattle next month. 
</P>
<P>
"Today it was a matter of confidence and focusing on what I had done before. 
This is a dream come true," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Farmer-Patrick said that she is confident that she will do 
well in the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good race," Farmer-Patrick said. "I really can't make any excuses. My 
strength was there, and after another two or three weeks, I think I'll be 
definitely ready for the Goodwill Games -- without a doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Farmer-Patrick, who set her record at this meet last year, was positioned in 
the seventh lane. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in lane seven, so it was hard to see my competition," Farmer-Patrick 
said. "I thought I was in good shape. Then I came of the final curve and saw 
everybody in my race. I was surprised. I really can't make any excuses." 
</P>
<P>
While the women's 400-meter hurdles went to an unlikely winner, the javelin 
ended quite predictably. 
</P>
<P>
Karin Smith, a three-time Olympian in the event, won her sixth TAC championship 
with a throw of 206 feet 3 inches, outdistancing her nearest rival by more than 
12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
For world-class women's javelin throwers, the average age is 26, which might 
leave one wondering if the 34-year-old Smith has thought about retiring soon. 
</P>
<P>
For Smith, it's a regular question and a most annoying one. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she says flatly. "In fact, I think I can better my (personal record)."

PRESERVATIONISTS JOIN WITH MINING FIRMS TO FIGHT CORONA PLAN

CORONA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may not be all that far from the city, but Eagle Valley remains a bucolic 
reminder of the way life used to be around these parts, before bulldozers and 
builders arrived in force. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,105-acre parcel is just 10 minutes from downtown Corona, yet it is 
largely uninhabited and secluded -- and nearby residents want it to stay that 
way. But like most areas surrounding Corona, one of California's 
fastest-growing cities, the neighborhood has caught the eye of developers, who 
have pegged it for a huge residential development. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Valley Development Co. proposes to build 3,204 dwelling units on the 
site in the next seven to 10 years. In addition, the plan calls for several 
schools, a fire station and police offices. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, opposition to the project has placed environmentalists and mining 
companies on the same side. Residents say the proposed development would 
endanger wildlife, create even more of a traffic burden on Corona and open the 
area up for further development, bringing an end to their rural lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Several mining companies that have operated for years in the sparsely populated 
area do not want the burden of new subdivisions and neighbors complaining about 
the noise of drilling and blasting. 
</P>
<P>
But such concerns, developers say, are to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty standard feeling that people in general become uneasy when 
change is being proposed," said Dennis Bushore, vice president of the Eagle 
Valley Development Co., which bought the land last year. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Valley, named for golden eagles in the area, is about three miles 
southeast east of Corona and west of Lake Mathews, a reservoir for the 
Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the project depends on the Riverside County Local Agency Formation 
Commission approving Corona's bid to annex about 3,163 acres of unincorporated 
land. The annexation, expected to come before the commission late this summer 
or early this fall, would include the Eagle Valley development site, several 
homes and mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents plan to raise objections at the hearing, alarmed that Corona 
is growing well beyond its original borders. Starting in 1985, the city has 
been on an annexation binge. That year, it gobbled up 900 acres of 
unincorporated territory to the west to make room for Sierra del Oro, a 
3,196-unit planned community. Several other parcels have been annexed since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
"Corona is like a monster at the moment," said Art Cassel, who lives near Lake 
Mathews. "They're like a monster on a one-way ticket to metropolis-ville." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials argue that their bid for the unincorporated land stems from 
a desire to have more control over what goes on around them. If Corona has 
authority over the land, the city can regulate zoning, traffic and utilities. 
Some officials suggest that Corona has gotten the rap for problems created by 
growth all around Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Developers "are going to go somewhere," said Councilman Dick Deininger, a 
supporter of the development in Eagle Valley. "I'd rather have it developed in 
our area, where we have some control. . . . If we're going to get the blame for 
it, I want to get the whole blame." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Franklin said he believes that the city should speed up 
annexation of fringe areas before they become more populated. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see that occur as quickly as possible and as uniformly as 
possible," Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
Among neighbors' major concerns is that the Eagle Valley development will 
damage the environment, including the habitat for the Stephens kangaroo rat, 
which is on the federal endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
Cassel said: "It's an abomination against nature. . . . The City Council seems 
to be waging a war against nature. This is another one of the many." 
</P>
<P>
An environmental review presented and approved by the Corona City Council 
earlier this year concluded that the impact to the kangaroo rat can be reduced 
but not eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The review "showed that it was going to be terrible, but (the City Council) 
passed it anyway," said Jim Sparks, who lives near the project area just south 
of Cajalco Road. 
</P>
<P>
Bushore of Eagle Development, however, said the project will reserve 450 acres 
-- largely on ridgelines surrounding the valley -- for natural open space, plus 
an additional 32 acres of parkland, which will provide ample room for the 
kangaroo rat to travel freely in and out of the development. 
</P>
<P>
The developer will also pay Riverside County for the creation of any new 
habitat needed for displaced kangaroo rats, Corona senior planner Ron Running 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mining companies have voiced fears that new homeowners in Eagle 
Valley would complain about noise from drilling and blasting. Minnesota Mining 
and Manufacturing, which has a rock-mining plant bordering the site, had 
planned on being part of the annexation to Corona, but it pulled its 900 acres 
out of the project area and will remain unincorporated Riverside County land. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any good things for mining companies," said Bud Sloan, plant 
manager for Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
But he doubted that the mining will affect the sale of new homes: "If it's 
attractive enough, people will even buy next to an airport." 
</P>
<P>
Bushore countered that new neighborhoods in Eagle Valley would be sufficiently 
buffered from the mining noise: "It's in a valley all to its own." 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors have other complaints, in particular worries that the project 
will add to already-nightmarish traffic jams on the Riverside and Corona 
freeways. Residents of El Cerrito, an unincorporated community west of Eagle 
Valley, suggest that traffic from the project will spill over onto their 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, most residents doubt that they can stop the project. Dan 
Wishard, an architect who lives near Eagle Valley, said a better tack would be 
to adopt an approach of "if you can't beat em, join em." 
</P>
<P>
Residents battling the development, Wishard argued, "have no say in anything. 
They've lost every battle they've fought." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested instead that foes try to work with developers to see that their 
concerns are addressed. "You can fight it and lose, or you can join it and have 
a hand in it," he said.

EPA, OIL FIRMS GRAPPLE OVER FULLERTON CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the Environmental Protection Agency is increasingly allowing companies 
that created toxic waste sites to prepare their own cleanup plans, the 
solutions being proposed for the McColl toxic waste dump in Fullerton were 
prepared by state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But the EPA and the oil companies believed responsible for creating the World 
War II-era dump disagree on which solution is best for McColl. 
</P>
<P>
Based on studies conducted by the EPA and the state health agency, four 
separate plans have been proposed to clean up the site. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's "preferred" method is the most stringent and involves digging up and 
burning the toxic waste, at an estimated cost of $117 million to $300 million. 
The companies support the least extensive option -- sealing the wastes in the 
ground beneath a permanent cover -- at one-fifth the cost. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA, which intends to hold the companies responsible for performing and 
paying for the cleanup, will make its decision on the method next spring. While 
the companies have offered to pay for the "capping" solution, they have said 
they will refuse to pay for a more stringent cleanup and, if sued by the EPA, 
believe that they would win in court. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal environmental agencies began studying McColl and devising 
ways to prevent the estimated 150,000 tons of wastes from getting into the air 
or water in 1980, before the EPA typically turned those tasks over to the 
suspected polluters, an EPA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But EPA officials are trying to force the companies to conduct a study to 
determine whether toxins have gotten into ground water. The oil companies have 
offered to pay for the study and maintenance costs, but they refused last week 
to do the work themselves, citing potential exposure to lawsuits should 
unexpected environmental problems be uncovered.

PRANK FAILS, BUT UCI ENGINEERS STILL GRADUATE 
</P>

Sections of two 20-foot-long poles and a long paper banner with a complicated 
equation scrawled across it were smuggled under graduation gowns and assembled 
by engineering students in secret Saturday as a UC Irvine commencement day 
prank. 
</P>
<P>
But the stunt, intended to poke fun at the grade-point average of biological 
science majors, backfired on the future engineers when one of the poles snapped 
and the banner fell on the heads of its makers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to be a burn on bio," said UCI junior Cathy Stites as she 
looked over the crumpled banner lying in a heap. "Too bad nobody saw it. It's 
really great." 
</P>
<P>
It's the type of prank that people have come to expect at a UCI commencement, 
since in its 25-year history the school has garnered a worldwide reputation as 
one of the best institutions for scientific research and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, about 30,000 people gathered at the university's Aldrich Park to 
witness UCI's 25th commencement exercise, an event that marked the beginning of 
a yearlong silver anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In three shifts, most of this year's 4,486 graduates crowded into the park in 
the center of the campus to commemorate the end of years of late-night study, 
mind-bending research and crushing final exams. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-five years is very young for a university," UCI Chancellor Jack 
Peltason said in his commencement address. "Just as you are the beneficiary of 
the vision of those who planned and built this university, so you are 
participating in the planning and building of the next 25 years of UCI." 
</P>
<P>
Graduates of the school's engineering, biological sciences, physical sciences, 
fine arts, humanities, information and computer sciences, social ecology and 
social sciences programs received degrees. Graduates of UCI's graduate school 
of management received their degrees in a separate ceremony elsewhere on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 3,487 students were conferred bachelor's degrees, 608 received master's 
degrees, 299 were "hooded" with doctoral degrees and 92 were given medical 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The basic premise of science was the theme of the morning student speaker, C. 
Douglas Hunter, who repeatedly told fellow graduates that when they make a 
mistake, "figure out what happened, learn from it and don't let it happen 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Soon Hunter had most graduates reciting that line with him each time he gave 
another example of the setbacks they can expect in the professional world. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go into industry and you don't meet your deadline," he said, and in 
unison the graduates spontaneously chanted with him, "figure it out, learn from 
it and don't let it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
In his commencement speech, Peltason praised the university's multicultural 
student population, which contains a large number of Third World students. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to remind ourselves that UCI has a major role in the new culture of 
California and the United States," Peltason said, urging students of all races 
to "learn from each other and build on the values we all share. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Our country has a tradition of hospitality to those from other shores," 
Peltason said. "Look at our college campuses and you see the face of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a different face from the present and it will reflect a global rather 
than a European perspective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, said UCI spokeswoman Betty Tessman, deans were coached before 
commencement through a list of unfamiliar names they were scheduled to read. 
</P>
<P>
One name, although simple to pronounce, proved the most embarrassing of the day 
for Vice Chancellor Horace Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart Simpson," Mitchell called out as he read the name on a 3x5 card handed to 
him by one graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Bart Simpson is the name of a well-known cartoon character who has raised 
controversy because of the character's pride in being an underachiever. 
</P>
<P>
The prankster, Christopher Lee Marx, who replaced his name on the card with the 
name of Bart Simpson, however, is far from an underachiever. An engineering and 
physics major, Marx earned a bachelor of science degree cum laude. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while they get you," Mitchell said, realizing his mistake when 
hearty laughter broke throughout the audience. 
</P>
<P>
A planned protest by the Social Awareness Collective, which opposes plans to 
build a chancellor's residence on environmentally sensitive land, did not 
materialize, but members passed out flyers asking graduates to send letters of 
opposition to the chancellor. The group contends that the proposed residence 
would upset the nesting site of the California gnatcatcher, a small bird that 
is classified as "sensitive" by the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
Good-natured pranks from the ranks of the graduates continued to vex campus 
police and administrators who were hoping for a staid ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of pomp and circumstance, graduates in black caps and gowns threw 
brightly colored beach balls, set off smoke bombs and jeered at graduates from 
rival departments. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, graduates -- apparently tired of sitting on lawn chairs for 
two hours -- created human "waves," by standing up, waving their arms and 
sitting down in succession. 
</P>
<P>
After the 9 a.m. ceremony, one biological sciences major gloated over the 
failed prank by rival engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"Those engineers are geeks," said Omid Vafa, who wore a blue tassel that 
signified he was being recognized for excellence in a research project with the 
Beckman Laser Institute. "They (engineers) don't get out. What can I say?"

SURFING MUSEUM OPENS TO TIDE OF BLESSINGS, TWANGING GUITARS 
</P>

<P>
While the politicians and business leaders gave speeches and smiled for 
publicity photos outside, David Nuuhiwa strolled into the new International 
Surfing Museum, alone, mumbling prayers while sprinkling seawater on the 
museum's walls, walkways and memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly oblivious to the block party kicking up to christen the museum's new 
downtown location Saturday, Nuuhiwa, clad in white clothing and draped with an 
exotic lei of orange Hawaiian flowers, was enacting a traditional island 
ceremony of blessing, bestowing love, unity and friendship upon the building. 
</P>
<P>
He emerged after a few minutes, flicking a few final drops onto the museum's 
threshold and the ritual was complete. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, dozens of invited guests crowded into a line to get their first 
glimpse of the museum's new home. 
</P>
<P>
For at least the next two years, the 2,200-square-foot building on Olive Street 
will serve as Surf City's tribute to the history of the sport until a permanent 
location is built at the foot of a new Municipal Pier being planned to replace 
the city's aging landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Polynesian dancers, singers, guitarist Dick Dale, old-time surfers, city and 
business leaders and more than 100 guests gathered for an opening celebration 
that blended Hawaiian culture, pomp and rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Following the singers' renditions of traditional, Hawaiian-language songs, a 
Polynesian feast of roast pig and a presentation on surfing heritage by the 
editor of Surfer magazine, Dale and his Deltones performed a concert on a stage 
erected between Main and 5th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on hand for the ceremony were Dorian (Doc) Paskowitz, one of the 
pioneer surfers in Orange County, and Faye Baird Fraser, 81, believed to be 
America's first female surfer. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser, who surfed on 100-pound wooden boards at San Diego's Mission Beach 
during the 1920s, said she still follows the surfing scene and marvels at 
today's surfers. She noted that she often wanted to take up the sport again, 
but said, "I could never ride any of those new boards." 
</P>
<P>
The day's festivities got under way Saturday morning on the beach two blocks 
away, with volleyball and long-board surfing contests, and a showing of about 
75 "woodie"-style station wagons in the parking lot north of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Open to the public for the first time today between noon and 4 p.m., the new 
museum provides a condensed look back at the origin of the surf board, surf 
guitar rock and surfing legends -- most notably Duke Kahanamoku, an Olympic 
swimmer-turned-actor renowned as "America's father of surfing," and the man to 
whom the museum is dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
At the museum's entrance, visitors were greeted by a brass bust of Kahanamoku, 
who died in 1968 at the age of 78, adorned with a lei and an assortment of 
other flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Along the walls, pictures of Kahanamoku and other notable surfers are exhibited 
between displays representing seven stages of the surf board's development. The 
artifacts include a 39-inch-long Hawaiian Pipo board, built just before the 
turn of the century, a series of 8-, 10- and 12-foot wooden boards from the 
1920s through the 1950s, and a bright red, circa-1966 fiberglass board. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Dale's guitar adorns another wall, surrounded by his album covers and 
those of such other surf rockers as the Beach Boys, the Challengers, the 
Surfaris and the Fantastic Baggys. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Williams, the museum's curator, said the limited size of the new building 
allows him to display only a smattering of the available artifacts chronicling 
surfing history, which he has been collecting for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we're so small here, we've just picked the most important pieces to 
put out," he said. "And we've arbitrarily cut (the displays) off at the 
mid-'60s." 
</P>
<P>
He envisions the permanent museum, scheduled to open in 1992 along with the new 
pier, as encompassing somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000 square feet. It is 
planned to include a surfing Hall of Fame, a "3-D surf theater" that would 
enable visitors to experience the sensation of shooting a curl and a full 
display of surfing memorabilia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $90,000 cost of remodeling the museum's existing home was financed through 
city redevelopment funds and private donations, Williams said. The museum's 
directors will spend the next two years trying to secure grants and additional 
donations to pay for the future facility, which he estimates will cost more 
than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Paskowitz, revered by many surfers as Orange County's godfather of the sport, 
said he believes other cities may have had a legitimate claim to the 
International Surfing Museum, but Huntington Beach is its rightful home. 
</P>
<P>
"There are places that have a more authentic history or more credibility for 
pioneering," said Paskowitz, who has been surfing for nearly six decades. "But 
Huntington Beach has always been a kind of focal point for surfing, where new 
things were always being done. There was always a certain ferment and 
hell-raising attitude here, where you saw all kinds of off-the-wall 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntington Beach opened its heart to surfing. Of course, the surfers 
eventually stole it. But that's why the museum is here, and that's why Duke 
Kahanamoku's statue is here."

<P>
ORGANIZATIONS: THE ORIGINAL OPERATION RESCUE, FORMED IN 1981 TO RESOLVE THE 
STATUS OF MISSING U.S. SERVICEMEN, WANTS THE ANTI-ABORTION GROUP TO FIND

<P>
Retired Air Force Col. Jack Bailey wants folks to know about Operation Rescue 
-- not the anti-abortion group, but another effort that adopted that name 
almost a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The original Operation Rescue, founded by Bailey in 1981, works toward 
resolving the status of U.S. servicemen missing in action or taken prisoner 
during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
But much of Bailey's time and that of other group volunteers is spent answering 
telephone calls intended for the anti-abortion organization that organized its 
Orange County chapter in February, 1989. Phone numbers for the second Operation 
Rescue are taped to a file cabinet in the office of the first Operation Rescue 
to redirect confused callers. 
</P>
<P>
The original group's office has been vandalized, and mail seeking donations for 
the POW/MIA effort has been returned with notes saying the recipient would not 
give money to an anti-abortion group, Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty annoying, and it has hurt us in many ways," Bailey said. "Many of 
our supporters who believe it should be the woman's right to choose thought we 
were the other Operation Rescue, and they disassociated themselves with us." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Finn, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group, said its leaders had no 
idea when they selected the name that another group was using it. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become a generic name for groups of people who have the common goal of 
saving babies from abortion and helping women in crisis pregnancy," Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two groups have met in a bid to quell the confusion, and 
both contacted the telephone company to ensure that operators make the 
distinction between the organizations. 
</P>
<P>
However, in 10 telephone calls by The Times to directory assistance, every 
operator offered the number for the MIA/POW Operation Rescue. Callers seeking 
the number for the anti-abortion group, which has an Anaheim mailing address 
and a Cypress phone number, must ask for the group's full name: Southern 
California Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
As a registered California corporation, the original Operation Rescue has legal 
rights to the name. A representative of the California secretary of state's 
office said the only way to protect the name is by filing a lawsuit -- a move 
that Bailey said he is considering. 
</P>
<P>
The POW/MIA group's name originated in 1981 when Operation Rescue sponsored a 
boat that rescued Vietnamese refugees afloat in the South China Sea. Bailey, 
who said he flew 256 combat missions in Vietnam, coordinates the group's 
efforts to collect information on those still missing and to help refugees. 
There are an estimated 2,000 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, 
according to Pentagon estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey wants the anti-abortion group to change its name. But Finn said that 
even if her group adopts a new name, the public will continue to think of it as 
Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
She added that anti-abortion activists have offered to help Bailey by sending 
volunteers to answer his telephones. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I have someone in my office answering phones for them?" an annoyed 
Bailey answered. 
</P>
<P>
Finn also said her organization might consider buying the rights to the name, 
another option that does not appease Bailey. "The name isn't for sale to no one 
for no amount," he said. "We're not going to give up our name, and we're fed up 
with this crap."

PACIFIC SYMPHONY DIRECTOR IS HONORED

<P>
Carl St. Clair, the newly appointed director of the Pacific Symphony Orchestra 
of Orange County, received a prestigious national honor Saturday for promising 
young conductors on the threshold of major careers. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair and Kenneth Jean, music director of the Florida Symphony Orchestra, 
were jointly given the 1990 Seavers/National Endowment for the Arts Conductors 
Award during a luncheon of the American Symphony Orchestra League in 
Washington. Each will receive a $75,000 grant, one of the largest conducting 
awards offered in the world today. 
</P>
<P>
"It really took me aback, and my heart started pounding," St. Clair said from 
Washington, describing his reaction as the award was announced. "It's the 
perfect segue into another part of my life. It gives me a whole new outlook -- 
like a booster rocket with another stage in it."

<P>
St. Clair, who will take over the Pacific Symphony on Oct. 1, is assistant 
conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and music director of both the Ann 
Arbor Symphony in Michigan and the Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Jean, in addition to his post with the Florida Symphony Orchestra, is associate 
conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and principal guest conductor of 
the Hong Kong Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
The Seavers/NEA award, established in June, 1985, is offered every two years to 
help promising U.S. conductors ages 28 to 42. The award is presented jointly by 
the National Endowment for the Arts and the Seavers Institute, a Los Angeles 
foundation that provides grants to science, education and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Jean and St. Clair were selected from 50 candidates recommended for the award 
by about 200 U.S. music professionals. The awards process can take two years as 
the judges dissect the careers and potential of some of the most talented 
conductors in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The honor bestows upon recipients financial aid, artistic and professional 
guidance and institutional support. It also offers them the chance to consult 
with a distinguished panel of advisers and with leading orchestra 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair said the award will make possible several projects, including 
language studies that could help him pursue plans to conduct more operas. He 
said the grant will also make it possible for him to travel to important 
performances given by the world's premier classical artists. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's great that the private sector through the Seavers Institute 
would join in with the public sector, the NEA, and give this amount of money," 
St. Clair said. "It is a profound honor for me." 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair, 37, was the youngest of nine candidates when he was picked as music 
director of the Pacific Symphony. Under terms of his three-year contract with 
the orchestra, he will oversee the orchestra's artistic development and 
planning and conduct six pairs of classical concerts each season at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. In addition, he will conduct two concerts each 
summer season at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
His appointment ended a search that began in February, 1988, with the 
resignation of founding music director Keith Clark after a bitter power 
struggle with the orchestra's board of directors.

<P>
A Corona del Mar man drowned after he fell into a stream and was swept over a 
waterfall, Hawaii County police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as Paul Gregory Feit, 23, was pronounced dead after 
falling into the Wailuku River in Hilo on Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness told police that Feit and two of his friends had been swimming in the 
river on the east side of the island of Hawaii, about 200 miles from Honolulu, 
before the 1:35 p.m. accident. Feit apparently fell into the stream after he 
and his friends had finished swimming, police said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the witness, Feit surfaced and went over the waterfall, but was 
apparently pulled underwater again by the currents. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Feit, the victim's father, said his son was in Hawaii vacationing with 
several college friends. 
</P>
<P>
The father said his son's friends called him Friday at the family's Corona del 
Mar home to explain what happen, but the circumstances remained clouded. "To 
tell you the truth, I'm still a little confused about what happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently he hit his head on something when he went over the waterfall," the 
father said. "If that had something to do with the accident, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's autopsy Saturday determined that Feit had drowned. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Feit said he hopes to get all the facts of the accident when he sits 
down and talks to his son's friends, who are flying back to the mainland to 
bring the family Paul's belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Feit graduated from Loyola Marymount University in Westchester last year 
with a degree in finance and had been working as a loan officer for Wells Fargo 
Bank in Huntington Beach, his father said.

ARTS GROUP TARGETS NEA STAND BY ROHRABACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rock singer Sammy Hagar and actress Stephanie Zimbalist will soon get an earful 
about U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita). 
</P>
<P>
Zimbalist and Hagar are among hundreds of Rohrabacher's political contributors 
who are being targeted in a mailing this week by a Long Beach-based group that 
opposes the congressman's efforts to rein in the National Endowment for the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, whose district includes part of northwestern Orange County, and 
other Capitol Hill conservatives accuse the federal agency of subsidizing 
obscene and sacrilegious art projects. But the Long Beach group, a coalition of 
artists and arts supporters, charges the conservatives with censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like this is a way to take the debate right back to the gasoline pump 
of the political process," said Michael Nash, video curator of the Long Beach 
Museum of Art. "We're going to ask (Rohrabacher's contributors) to urge him to 
reconsider his position and, if that doesn't work, to reconsider their support 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, a first-term congressman up for reelection this year, says the 
vast majority of voters support his position. "I think the issue is helping me, 
frankly," he said Friday. "I think most voters agree that standards should be 
set so tax dollars aren't wasted on obscene art." 
</P>
<P>
The mailing, by the Long Beach/Orange County chapter of the National Campaign 
for Freedom of Expression, is the leading edge of an effort by members of the 
art community to take on Rohrabacher in his back yard -- the 42nd Congressional 
District. The largely Republican district stretches from Torrance to Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Playing a prominent part in the drive is the National Campaign for Freedom of 
Expression, a Washington lobbying group created in April by artists and art 
activists to support the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
When the national group was formed in April, organizers said one of their first 
tasks would be to encourage grass-roots campaigns against two leading opponents 
of the NEA: Rohrabacher and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
A month later, the group's Long Beach/Orange County chapter was formed. It 
plans to run local print and broadcast ads criticizing the effort to regulate 
the artistic content of NEA art projects and highlighting Rohrabacher's role in 
that effort. 
</P>
<P>
The local chapter says it has 50 members so far, including artists, arts 
administrators, educators and others opposed to limits on the NEA. It plans to 
hold a fund-raiser within a month to collect money for the advertisements, 
which are being developed free of charge by artists in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say interest in the effort is growing. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue strikes right at the very core not only of practicing artists, but 
also of individuals in society and the right to express one's self," said Bill 
Viola, a nationally recognized video artist who lives in Long Beach. "Each 
meeting, more people come. The energy level is really up." 
</P>
<P>
The organizers say out-of-state NEA supporters, acting individually, are also 
interested in taking the fight to Rohrabacher, a former Reagan speechwriter who 
won election to Congress in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
An example is John Payson, an art dealer based in Florida who last month sent 
letters to the three Democratic candidates then competing in a primary campaign 
for the right to challenge Rohrabacher on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Payson wrote that he opposed Rohrabacher's stance on the endowment and 
solicited the Democrats' views on the agency so that he could consider giving 
them his support. 
</P>
<P>
Told Friday that Guy C. Kimbrough of Huntington Beach, the apparent winner of 
the Democratic primary, supports unrestricted federal funding of the art 
endowment, Payson said Kimbrough can expect a $1,000 contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been very, very upset about Rohrabacher's stand on the NEA," said 
Payson. ". . . If (Kimbrough) is indeed opposing that stand, I will send him 
the maximum check allowed under the law to beat Rohrabacher." 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiment is good news to Kimbrough, who appeared headed for victory over 
James Cavuoto of Torrance and Bryan W. Stevens of Rolling Hills Estates last 
week as the remaining absentee ballots in the tight primary contest were being 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Mt. San Jacinto political science instructor begins his general 
election bid with next to no campaign reserves compared to Rohrabacher, who at 
last count has saved $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough, who lost to Rohrabacher in the 1988 general election, also faces a 
53% to 36% Republican voter registration edge over Democrats in the 42nd 
District. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he can use the arts debate as one of several issues to pry 
Republican voters -- and campaign contributors -- from Rohrabacher. Others, he 
said, include abortion, which Rohrabacher favors banning, and offshore oil 
drilling, which the incumbent generally supports. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Republicans in the district are in the arts community or are patrons of 
the arts," Kimbrough said. "I think there's a tremendous potential for this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher acknowledges that the arts issue could stir up some political 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"When I took this position, I knew it would increase the number of people 
working actively against my reelection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rohrabacher says voters will be receptive to his argument that placing 
artistic content restrictions on government art grants does not constitute an 
attack on freedom of expression.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As they have done all season, Jackie Silva and Janice Opalinski were thrilling 
the crowd with their line-drive serves in the Huntington Beach Open women's pro 
volleyball tournament Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, Rita Crockett-Royster and her partner, Dennie Knoop, were 
struggling with their second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy for Crockett-Royster to be a bit upset with Silva, a friend 
and former partner who has won the first five stops on the tour with Opalinski 
of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Crockett-Royster of Costa Mesa was the odd-player-out in May, when she returned 
from playing indoor pro volleyball in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, who has won 16 of the past 18 beach tournaments the past two years with 
four different partners, had agreed to team with Crockett-Royster. But after 
Silva and Opalinski won the first three tournaments, they decided to extend 
their partnership through at least mid-season. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew before I came back from Italy that Jackie and I wouldn't be playing 
together," said Crockett-Royster, who is in her second season on the pro beach 
tour. "Italy is my commitment. Beach volleyball just keeps me in shape. Jackie 
makes her living at this. She needs a serious partner who's ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie and I figured that since they were winning, why change partners? I 
needed someone to play with who could keep me in the top five, too." 
</P>
<P>
Crockett-Royster and Knoop lost to Lori Zeno-Biller and Kathy Hanley, 15-9, in 
their second-round match, but rallied with two victories to advance to today's 
losers' bracket of the double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Silva and Opalinski, meanwhile, cruised into the winners' bracket 
semifinal against fourth-seeded Gail Castro and Lori Kotas, who defeated 
fifth-seeded Angela Rock and Julie Schaar-Thornton in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Chisholm-Carrillo and Linda Robertson, seeded sixth, upset second-seeded 
Elaine Roque and Nina Matthies, 15-12, in the quarterfinals. Chisholm-Carrillo 
and Robertson will meet Patty Dodd and Karolyn Kirby in the other winners' 
bracket semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
The losers' bracket semifinals begin at 8:30 today and the winners' bracket 
semifinals at 9:30. The championship game is scheduled for 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Crockett-Royster and Knoop, seeded seventh, have advanced through the losers' 
bracket before. They finished fifth in last week's tournament at Santa Cruz 
after an early-round loss. They finished fourth in their first tournament at 
Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Crockett-Royster and Knopp need at least a ninth-place finish at Huntington 
Beach to secure eighth place in the overall standings. The top eight teams on 
the tour are invited to a July 7-8 tournament in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal when we started playing was to make the top eight," Crockett-Royster 
said. "Our other goal is to win at Japan (July 28-29) and finish the season in 
the top three." 
</P>
<P>
Crockett-Royster hopes her play on the beach tour will parallel her success 
indoors. A member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, she signed a two-year, 
six-figure contract last year to play in the Italian indoor league, which runs 
from October to May. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Italian league) offered enough money to make me leave America," 
Crockett-Royster said. "I can see (that much money) on the beach tour in a 
couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Silva led the money winners on the beach tour last season with $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
Crockett-Royster apparently was worth every penny of her contract, earning most 
valuable player honors and leading her team, Matera, to the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
And if Crockett-Royster wins a beach championship this summer, it probably 
won't be with Silva. 
</P>
<P>
Silva is known for changing teammates often, but Crockett-Royster has ruled out 
any possibility of reuniting their partnership this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made a commitment to Dennie," she said. "Dennie is helping me make money 
and I'm helping her make money. It wouldn't be fair to her or I if one of us 
left later in the season."

FARLOW CHANGES HIS MIND, HE'LL JOIN PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton shortstop Kevin Farlow, who announced last week that he 
would return to school for his senior season, said he has changed his mind and 
will sign with the San Diego Padres today. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, a 6-foot-4, 175-pound junior who was a 15th-round draft pick of the 
Padres, wasn't happy with the club's original signing offer and told Fullerton 
Coach Larry Cochell he would remain a Titan for one more season. 
</P>
<P>
But after hitting with a wood bat for a week, attending the Padres' 3-1, 
13-inning victory over the Dodgers Friday night, and after the organization 
increased its signing offer, Farlow decided to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, a former Kennedy High School of Granada Hills and USC infielder, batted 
.277 with six home runs and 31 runs batted in at Fullerton this past season. He 
will report Monday to the Padres' Class-A affiliate in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"My main question was whether I could make the transition from the aluminum bat 
to the wood bat," said Farlow, who played two seasons at USC before 
transferring to Fullerton. "But I hit with a wood bat for a week and it felt 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Watching the Padres play the Dodgers Friday night confirmed his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem like San Diego is deep as far as shortstops go," Farlow said. 
"It seems like I'd have a good opportunity in that organization." 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, who brought defensive stability to the Titan infield this season, was 
named to the all-Central Regional team after playing four errorless games and 
going four for 14 with two doubles. Fullerton won the regional but lost its 
first two College World Series games. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish him the best," Cochell said. "He had a great season and I'm glad we had 
him for a year."

WESTERN DIGITAL PULLS TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
IRVINE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger W. Johnson believes in corporate togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
So much so that the chairman and chief executive of Western Digital Corp., 
which makes circuit boards, disk drives and other electronic innards for 
personal computers, is moving his company's decision-makers and chip designers 
into a house that Johnson built: a gleaming headquarters that springs up 14 
stories in the Irvine Spectrum business park. 
</P>
<P>
By corralling the company's executives, engineers and designers in one spot, 
Johnson hopes to overcome traditional rivalries that block innovation. This new 
sense of togetherness is especially important for Western Digital, which 
employs a motley crew of chip architects brought together by six acquisitions 
over the past five years. The concept is also the key to setting the company 
apart from its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wants to instill in Western Digital's culture his idea of 
"interarchitecture," or designing and manufacturing a family of electronic 
parts to work together so that the net result is better overall computer 
performance than if they were built independently. 
</P>
<P>
But he knows that it will take more than fancy terms like interarchitecture and 
a splashy new building to sway outside skeptics who think the latest 
incarnation of 20-year-old Western Digital is a crazy collection of companies 
bound by aimless acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
While the company's financial performance has improved this year, some industry 
observers criticize Western Digital management for spending too much time 
acquiring companies instead of executing its business. And by trying to be all 
things to all computer manufacturers, Western Digital, they fear, may only make 
itself vulnerable to competitors in each of its five business categories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to claim a victory for Western Digital's strategy," said Steven 
Ossad, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "They are having 
a change in fortunes, but a lot remains to be seen. They've been a 
disappointment before." 
</P>
<P>
Says Johnson: "We've spent time swallowing acquisitions. Now we have to 
execute." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Johnson's scheme for gathering various pieces of the production 
process at a single site is not original. 
</P>
<P>
Other manufacturers, such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Apple Computer Inc., have 
designed new products by combining resources from all levels of the company, 
said Jim Mottern, a manufacturing with the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson isn't straying from his no-nonsense management style to follow the 
likes of flashier Silicon Valley executives such as Steve Jobs, the Apple 
Computer co-founder who is now chairman of NeXT Inc. Rather, Johnson, whose 
conservative approach matches the dark three-piece suits he favors, believes 
the togetherness concept will bring Western Digital operating efficiencies. 
Companies that have pursued it found that they can get products to market much 
more quickly and cut development costs, Mottern said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all going to be a lot closer together (in the new headquarters), and 
inter-architecture should be a lot easier," said Kathryn A. Braun, senior vice 
president and general manager of Western Digital's largest division. "People 
were skeptical about it at first, but they're learning that we all have to be 
headed in the same creative direction." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also hopes that the new headquarters will be a symbol that bolsters the 
stature of Western Digital. The company's circuit boards and disk drives make 
possible smaller and faster computers, yet its name remains largely 
unrecognized outside the industry because it doesn't make consumer products, 
such as personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital's financial performance about a year ago didn't help the image. 
The company's earnings suffered last year, the result of a slow PC market and 
the cost of absorbing several acquisitions. The company lost $2.7 million in 
its fiscal 1990 first quarter ended Sept. 30, 1989, and laid off 950 people -- 
or 12% of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings have bounced back for the past two quarters, but the first-quarter 
deficit will hold profits below last year's levels. For the first nine months 
of the current year, the company earned $14.7 million on revenue of $776.6 
million, compared with earnings of $30 million and revenue of $748.6 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are estimating earnings of $20 million to $25 million for the fiscal 
year ending June 30, and Western Digital is expected for the first time this 
year to top $1 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The financial performance (in the past few years) has been bumpy," said David 
W. Schafer, vice president of worldwide sales. "It's not so hard to understand, 
but it's painful that people on Wall Street didn't see what we were up to. It's 
becoming clear now." 
</P>
<P>
While not everyone on Wall Street is sold on Western Digital's strategy, most 
analysts agree that the Irvine firm is at a transition point in its history. 
Its stock has risen sharply on persisting rumors of some big contracts from 
International Business Machines Corp. "I think they have made excellent 
progress in turning around their business and their image in the past two 
quarters," said Edmund C. Spelman, analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New 
York. "There is a healthy degree of skepticism because of their erratic track 
record, but they aren't promising more than they can deliver." 
</P>
<P>
While Western Digital's financial recovery can be attributed in part to 
improving conditions in the PC industry, Johnson believes that the company also 
is beginning finally to reap the benefits of a strategy he put in place when he 
joined the firm in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's plan from the start was to assemble a collection of computer 
component suppliers and make Western Digital a one-stop supermarket for 
personal computer makers worldwide. This strategy was intended to help Western 
Digital in two ways. 
</P>
<P>
The company could gain efficiencies from co-manufacturing the various products 
and then packaging the products together and selling them at reduced costs to 
PC makers. And once it owned each of the component businesses, it could develop 
an advantage over competitors through interarchitecture. 
</P>
<P>
To expand into the computer graphics market, Western Digital acquired Paradise 
Systems in 1986 and Verticom Inc. in 1988. To strengthen its business in 
devices that control data storage, the company acquired Adaptive Data Systems 
in 1987, and it entered the business of making core logic chips that control 
communication between computer peripherals and the central processing unit with 
the 1987 purchase of Faraday Electronics Inc. It moved into the fast-growing 
market for networks that link PCs, printers and related equipment by buying 
ViaNetix Inc. in 1987. And finally, by buying Tandon Corp.'s disk drive 
business in 1988, the company entered the intelligent disk drive business. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson says Western Digital remains unique among PC components manufacturers 
because of the wide array of products it makes. On a value basis, they account 
for about 50% of the cost of a PC's parts. The only parts it doesn't make are 
the central processing chip and mass memory chips. 
</P>
<P>
To a casual observer, Western Digital's acquisitions might look like a 
hodgepodge of loosely connected companies. But Johnson said the businesses 
share much in common: They are in markets where success means exploiting 
advances in semiconductor design. 
</P>
<P>
And in that respect, Johnson says, his company has a leg up on its competitors 
through its alliance with AT&amp;T Corp. in which AT&amp;T makes 
state-of-the-art chips for Western Digital. 
</P>
<P>
But Western Digital has been careful not to become overly dependent on 
AT&amp;T. So Johnson is building a $119-million wafer fabrication manufacturing 
plant in Irvine that is scheduled to open in January. 
</P>
<P>
The core logic chips introduced by Western Digital in March allowed the company 
to integrate the functions of more than 30 chips into three. The Western 
Digital-designed chips are faster when used together than when they are used 
with non-Western Digital products, making them the first products that exhibit 
interarchitecture. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, our parts are all designed by Western Digital people," 
Johnson said. "We've been planning to get into this position for eight years. 
We think we have built an engine that will give us an inherent advantage over 
our competitors." 
</P>
<P>
Some skeptics, such as Montgomery Securities' Ossad, say there is little 
concrete evidence that Johnson's business strategy or inter-architecture plan 
will give the company a competitive advantage over such Silicon Valley rivals 
as Conner Peripherals, a disk drive maker, or Chips &amp; Technologies, which 
makes core logic chips that control communication between computer peripherals 
and the central processing unit. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital's challenge is to get each of its major product lines 
profitable at once, but that's easier said than done because of fierce 
competition in each area. As Braun put it, "If all Roger's kids can perform in 
the same quarter, we would blow Wall Street away." 
</P>
<P>
The task is made more difficult by a lack of industry design standards and the 
need to redesign the same components for different types of computers, such as 
laptops or workstations. 
</P>
<P>
The disk drive business, for example, has been a particularly volatile segment 
of the industry with thin profit margins. But disk drives are quickly becoming 
Western Digital's bread-and-butter business, accounting for 37% of its sales 
now compared to 8% in fiscal 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its growing dependence on disk drive sales, Western Digital was 
hampered in its efforts to become a major player in the field when it was slow 
to develop a line of 3.5-inch "intelligent" disk drives. The delay allowed 
Conner Peripherals to grab a bigger share of the market, said Crawford Del 
Prete, an analyst at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
But Del Prete said Western Digital has performed a good balancing act in making 
the transition to more profitable, higher-capacity disk drives and is in a good 
position to enter the next generation 2.5-inch disk drive market, examples of 
which are expected to hit the market in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say it will take more than two consecutive profitable quarters to 
persuade them that the seesaw days are over at the Irvine computer company. 
</P>
<P>
The company says last year's layoffs were the last tasks in eliminating 
duplication from its many acquisitions. Almost as quickly as its fortunes sank, 
Western Digital recovered and its employment has grown to 7,500, above the 
pre-layoff level of 7,000 in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"This company looks like it's on the verge of a turnaround," said Richard L. 
Whittington, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "But looks aren't 
everything. I'd like to see them report good results for three to five quarters 
in a row." 
</P>
<P>
With 50% of its business overseas and sales to all personal computer 
manufacturers except Apple Computer, the company is no longer dependent on any 
one source or geographic region for its future well-being. In addition, the 
business is balanced between computer manufacturers, accounting for 62% of 
sales, and resellers, which provide 38% of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
And analysts are encouraged by the company's ability to reduce inventories and 
debt despite a heavy capital spending program that includes building a new 
semiconductor plant. 
</P>
<P>
Although the domestic PC market is not expected to grow as quickly as it did in 
the early 1980s, Johnson believes that the unification of Western European 
markets after 1992 and political liberalization in Eastern Europe offer 
opportunities for increased sales abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the days of big acquisitions are behind Western Digital, but that 
doesn't mean the company will not dabble in new markets. Eventually, Johnson 
believes Western Digital components will be used not just in PCs but also in a 
range of consumer electronics products. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Western Digital has been attracting attention recently because of 
rumors that it has been awarded a large contract to manufacture IBM's 
long-expected notebook-size computer. Western Digital and IBM refused to 
comment on any such deal. 
</P>
<P>
But, last month, Western Digital announced a cross-licensing agreement with 
IBM, and company officials have been dropping hints that the company has won 
some major design coups. And rumors of an IBM deal have helped Western 
Digital's stock, which reached a 52-week high of $14.75 per share on Thursday, 
but fell to $14.25 at Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Devin, an analyst for market researcher Dataquest in San Jose, said he 
expects an announcement during the next several months that Western Digital 
will manufacture IBM's notebook computer. 
</P>
<P>
If Western Digital has beaten its competitors to the IBM deal, analysts say it 
would be proof that Johnson's strategy, particularly the interarchitecture 
approach to chip design, is beginning to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
Buying into the PC 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital has parlayed its success as a maker of disk-storage circuitry 
into a billion-dollar-a-year business. Chairman Roger W. Johnson's strategy has 
been to acquire component manufacturers and weld diverse technologies into a 
unified PC architecture.

AMERICA'S RICHEST MAN BACKS CHATSWORTH LASER DISC COMPANY; 
</P>
<P>
VIDEOS: THE CHAIRMAN OF METROMEDIA CO. IS 'ENTHUSED,' HIS ATTORNEY SAYS, ABOUT 
THE 'TECHNOLOGY AND THE APPLICATIONS' USED BY IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Greenwald, chairman and chief executive of Image Entertainment Inc., 
which markets and distributes laser videodiscs, has a small pillow hanging on 
his office wall in Chatsworth. It reads: "Happiness is positive cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
The pillow was given to Greenwald by John Kluge, ranked by Forbes magazine as 
America's wealthiest individual with a net worth exceeding $5.2 billion. Above 
the pillow is a framed message from Kluge and his partner, Stuart Subotnick, 
that says: "Please don't sleep on this." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald says he's wide awake and has big plans for Image. Although Image lost 
$203,687 in the nine months ended Dec. 31 on $18.5 million in revenue, 
Greenwald said the company will soon report its first annual profit, for the 
fiscal year ended March 31. By 1995, he expects Image to churn out $300 million 
in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge, the chairman of Metromedia Co., apparently believes him because Kluge 
and Subotnick own 37.1% of Image, and their investment of $9.5 million has paid 
off so far. At Image's current stock price of about 80 cents a share, their 
stake has a market value of about $45.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Without John Kluge's involvement, this company would have been a blip," 
Greenwald admitted. 
</P>
<P>
What does the 75-year-old Kluge see in Image? 
</P>
<P>
Kluge is "enthused about the laser disc technology and the applications that 
Image is making of it," said Kluge's attorney, Arnold Wadler. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said Kluge, regarded by many in the investment community as a 
visionary for his early investments in broadcasting and cellular phones, was 
driven to invest in Image by "the same mentality that got him involved with 
cellular and paging operations." Kluge also has a stake in many of the movies 
that appear on laser disc: He owns 70% of Orion Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Laser videodiscs are to video what compact discs are to audio. Laser discs, 
12-inch optical recordings that look like large compact discs, offer crisper, 
cleaner sound and pictures far superior to those produced by videotape. Also, 
unlike tape, which loses quality each time it is played, discs literally don't 
wear out. 
</P>
<P>
Laser discs, which retail at $29.95, also cost less than some videotapes. 
Although prices of videotapes are coming down as the industry increasingly 
encourages buying over renting, some tapes still sell initially for prices as 
high as $90. 
</P>
<P>
But videotape still has advantages over laser discs. Owners of videocassette 
recorders can record their own tapes, while laser disc analysts say recordable 
laser disc players are still years away. Also, a good VCR can be purchased for 
$200, while laser disc players still average about $500. 
</P>
<P>
The laser disc market so far remains tiny compared with videotape. Even though 
laser disc players have been available for home use for about 10 years, only 
about 350,000 U.S. homes own one, Greenwald said. That compares with nearly 70 
million households that have VCRs, according to the Electronic Industries 
Assn., a Washington trade group. 
</P>
<P>
But association spokesman Mark Rosenker said, "The '90s might be the decade of 
the laser videodisc." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Anderson, editor of Special Situations Report, an investment newsletter, 
said the $50-million to $60-million laser disc market could grow to $600 
million over the next several years as prices for players continue to fall, 
more retail outlets offer laser discs and consumers interested in collecting 
movie and music videos become increasingly aware of laser. 
</P>
<P>
Another auspicious sign for the industry, Anderson said, is the entrance of 
Sony Corp., the Japanese consumer electronics powerhouse that recently acquired 
Columbia Pictures, into the laser disc market. Sony recently modified a compact 
disc plant in Indiana to produce laser discs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its small size, Image has established itself as one of the industry's 
two dominant players since entering the business more than five years ago. Its 
biggest competitor, Pioneer LDCA Inc., the Long Beach unit of Japanese consumer 
electronics giant Pioneer Electronics Corp., also makes laser disc players and 
is the biggest manufacturer of discs. 
</P>
<P>
Image expects to sell 2.4 million discs this year, compared with the 7 million 
Pioneer expects to sell. 
</P>
<P>
David Wallace, Pioneer LDCA's marketing manager, said Pioneer welcomed Image's 
emergence in the industry because competition is needed to help the market 
grow. Pioneer even helped Image by offering it favorable deals to manufacture 
its discs. But it was Image's sealing of long-term, exclusive licensing 
agreements with studios such as Orion, New World and MGM, that secured Image's 
position in the industry, Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
Under these deals, Image gives the studio anywhere from 15% to 40% of the sales 
of the discs, depending on volume, in exchange for the exclusive rights to 
market their films on disc. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very clever move on their part," Wallace said. "Until then, they were 
a very small factor in the business. But as a self-preservation move, we had to 
do it too." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said the licensing deals don't guarantee Image's future. In fact, he 
said, Image is often compared with Vestron Inc., a videotape distributor that 
went public with much fanfare in 1985 at $13 a share but has since collapsed to 
less than $1 a share as the company continues to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
Vestron's downfall has been largely attributed to the move by studios into 
distributing their own videos once they recognized the potential size of the 
market. It could be an ominous sign for Image that two studios -- Warner 
Brothers and MCA/Universal -- currently distribute their own laser discs. 
</P>
<P>
But Greenwald predicted that studios won't get into laser distribution en 
masse. One reason, he said, is that Vestron merely acted as a middleman between 
the studios and other companies that actually distributed the product. Image 
does its own marketing and distributing, Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
Image had an unusual birth. Greenwald, 48, had worked as a stockbroker in New 
Jersey for several years before moving to Los Angeles and starting Miracle Film 
Distributors, which sold X-rated films. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Greenwald got a call from Meyer Blinder, the Denver-based penny stock 
promoter who is currently under federal indictment for stock and wire fraud, 
charges he denies. Blinder asked Greenwald if he would be interested in buying 
Key International Film Distributors, a pornographic film distributor on the 
verge of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald put together a group of investors, bought Key for $150,000 and 
funneled Miracle product through Key for a few years. In 1984, Greenwald heard 
about laser disc technology while on a trip to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Greenwald turned to the adult film market, initially distributing 
X-rated fare on laser discs. "But we realized this was not the direction we 
wanted to go in nor the focus of attention we wanted to get from the outside 
world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald renamed the company and began pursuing the licensing deals with 
Hollywood studios. But Image, which had barely $6 million in revenue at the 
time, needed about $1 million to advance to the studios for the rights to 
market their films on disc. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald was then introduced to Subotnick, who, after hearing Greenwald's 
presentation about laser video, said, "We're interested." Since then, Greenwald 
said, "Stu and John have effectively funded the growth of this company." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said he's also interested in chasing the potential of laser video for 
educational and industrial applications. To keep on the cutting edge of 
developments in laser, Greenwald said Image has purchased a stake in North 
Communications, a Santa Monica firm that develops uses for laser disc 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
He's also spending $1 million to build a new editing facility at the Chatsworth 
plant that will allow Image to make its own master laser discs. That move will 
save Image about $100,000 a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Will Greenwald's faith in the future of laser video pay off? "That's the real 
risk," said Jonathan Steinberg, publisher of Special Situations Report. "Is 
this the right technology?"

CLEANER GAS: IS IT CLEAN ENOUGH?; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: OIL FIRMS HAVE SCRAMBLED TO BRING OUT LOWER-EMISSION FUELS. BUT 
STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORS WANT THEM TO GO FURTHER. THE INDUSTRY SAYS THE

<P>
Oil refiners are in a drag race for the public's gasoline dollars, but the flag 
they're after isn't checkered. It's green. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies that once sold high octane, drivability or detergent additives 
are now touting fuels that burn cleaner and produce less smog. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Chevron Corp. became the latest of eight oil companies to introduce a 
lower-emission gasoline since Atlantic Richfield Co. started the trend last 
September with its EC-1 gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Just how clean are these new fuels? Not as clean as they probably will have to 
be. And just how far is the oil industry willing to go in producing cleaner 
gasoline? Apparently, not much farther than it already has. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the question may become: How clean can we make gasoline and how 
much are we willing to pay for it? 
</P>
<P>
The oil companies hope to sell more gasoline by exploiting growing 
environmental awareness among consumers. But as Congress and the California Air 
Resources Board contemplate stricter clean air rules, the oil companies also 
want to demonstrate that gasoline should be the cleaner-burning fuel of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Arco's EC-1 may have helped boost gasoline atop the agenda of lower-emissions 
fuels, displacing methanol, ethanol and compressed natural gas as the clean 
fuel of choice among federal regulators. "We didn't come out with EC-1 to 
increase share of market but to increase share of mind," said George H. 
Babikian, president of Arco Products Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, none of the new gasolines would satisfy all the proposed 
regulations before Congress or the state air resources board. 
</P>
<P>
EC-1 comes closest. Others, such as Shell SU 2000E, Chevron Supreme Unleaded 
and Exxon Plus, differ only slightly from ordinary gasolines. Others fall 
somewhere in between. Phillips, Conoco, Marathon and Diamond Shamrock are also 
selling reduced-emissions gasoline in various parts of the country, and Amoco, 
Sun and Citgo are considering bringing out their own reformulated gasolines 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
All the new gasolines are being sold in tightly restricted markets, reflecting 
the limited ability of oil refiners to produce them. The fuels are being made 
by juggling components from other gasolines -- and refiners can take that only 
so far without making major investments in new refining equipment. 
</P>
<P>
That may underlie the oil industry's opposition to new gasoline formulations 
proposed for a revised federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its rush to sell lower-emissions fuels, the oil industry -- led by its 
main trade group, the American Petroleum Institute -- lobbied hard but 
unsuccessfully against the proposed Congressional formulas, which it derisively 
called "Government Gas." 
</P>
<P>
The API estimated that the new regulations would require $10 billion to $30 
billion in capital expenditures by refiners, forcing up to one-third of them 
out of business. The new rules would mean retail prices could be higher by 10 
to 15 cents per gallon and could even lead to gasoline shortages, the institute 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
The industry would prefer that Congress set targets for auto emission 
reductions rather than specify gasoline formulas. It would be more efficient 
and less costly to let refiners then devise their own formulas to meet the 
targets, the industry argues. 
</P>
<P>
It also wants regulators to await the results of a multimillion-dollar joint 
research project being conducted by the oil and auto industries on various 
formulations of gasoline before settling on a formula. Those results won't be 
ready until year-end. 
</P>
<P>
But air quality officials insist on specific standards. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no other way to regulate the actual emissions from fuel, because there 
can be a variety of cars that would use it," said state Air Resources Board 
spokesman Bill Sessa. At issue are the proposed changes in the federal Clean 
Air Act contained in bills approved by the U.S. Senate in April and the House 
of Representatives last month. The bills differ in a number of ways, but both 
would mandate changes in the way gasoline is refined. A final version of the 
revisions must be hammered out in a conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state Air Resources Board staff is developing proposals for 
reformulated gasoline. The board is supposed to vote on them in September. 
Where federal and state regulations overlap, the state board's rules would take 
precedence. Unlike Congress, the state is also contemplating rules that would 
require the use of alternative fuels beyond gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed rules would be among the most sweeping since state and federal 
governments began dictating what goes into gasoline. California led the way in 
the 1970s by setting limits on vapor pressure, or the tendency of gasoline to 
evaporate. It later required the phase-out of lead, a toxic substance linked to 
learning disorders in children. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, other states that once regulated only octane have begun to set 
standards for gasoline components. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government got into the act later. In 1975, it followed California 
in requiring the phase-out of lead nationwide, perhaps the biggest change in 
the refining of gasoline until now. Just last year, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency set national standards for vapor pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gone through major sea changes in the required chemical composition of 
gasoline over our history," said industry analyst Bernard J. Picchi at Salomon 
Bros. in New York. "Perhaps the most dramatic switch was the change from leaded 
to unleaded gasoline, and I think that was actually a more wrenching change for 
the industry than what is being contemplated here -- and that transition took 
place without there being a major dislocation." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the API, the EPA estimates the added cost to consumers of the 
new gas rules will be only 5 to 10 cents per gallon. Moreover, the API's 
$10-billion to $30-billion capital estimate is high, critics argue. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration puts the cost of the entire clean air law -- not just 
provisions dealing with reformulated gasoline -- at just $21.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
There is also disagreement over what effects the House and Senate versions of 
the Clean Air Act would have. 
</P>
<P>
Both bills would require the addition beginning in 1992 of high levels of 
oxygenates to gasoline sold in the nine smoggiest U.S. cities, including Los 
Angeles. More oxygenates would promote more efficient burning and reduce 
certain emissions, proponents argue. 
</P>
<P>
Both bills would also make refiners reduce aromatics and benzene, the most 
polluting components of gasoline. (Unlike the Senate bill, the House bill gives 
refiners flexibility on gasoline formulation, if they can meet or exceed 
emissions standards.) 
</P>
<P>
"The legislation passed by the House sets extremely stringent standards for 
reformulated gasoline," said Charles J. DiBona, president of API. 
</P>
<P>
He added in a statement: "Unless substantial changes are made in this 
legislation by a House-Senate conference committee, it may not be possible for 
the industry to continue to meet the fuel needs of consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, API argued that there is a significant shortage of a key 
oxygenate, methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. Lower-emissions gasolines now 
on the market all contain MTBE, but generally at less than half the levels that 
would be required by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the oil industry argue that refiners are less worried about higher 
costs or fuel shortages than they are about losing control of what goes into 
the nation's gasoline pool -- and giving up some of the attendant profits. 
</P>
<P>
By requiring higher levels of oxygenates, Congress will force refiners to go to 
outside sources for the chemicals if they can't make enough themselves. 
</P>
<P>
If the oxygenate is MTBE, that would mean eventually relinquishing control of 
15% of the gasoline pool. Some of that business would undoubtedly go to foreign 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
If refiners are forced to rely on ethanol, it would mean a sizable increase in 
business for Archer Daniels Midland, the agriculture conglomerate that produces 
about 45% of the nation's ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also argue that API has exaggerated the disruption that would result 
from the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
Even some refiners admit privately that they can accommodate the requirements 
of the proposed clean air bills, though they may not like having to shell out 
the capital investments. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody likes to be forced to make dramatic changes that aren't kind of 
market-driven and that you have time to work into," said David Kem, general 
manager of marketing in North America for Conoco Inc. in Houston. "But this 
industry has adapted to other things, and I think it will adapt to this." 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think it is going to result in the closure of refineries; in fact, I 
would argue just the opposite," Picchi said. "As a result of the new higher 
level of capital spending required to retool refineries . . . , you'll probably 
see refiners at the same time taking advantage of the situation to spend more 
money to expand capacity." 
</P>
<P>
That's because the clean air requirements could make it easier to get permits 
that might otherwise be hard-won, particularly in environmentally sensitive 
areas such as Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield, for one, is planning to expand gasoline-making capacity at 
its refineries in Carson and Cherry Point, Wash., at the same time that it 
retools to make more reformulated gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, Arco plans to spend $1.1 billion at the refineries to 
make reformulated gasoline. After that, it will spend $1 billion to $1.3 
billion to meet future requirements for the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, the nation's largest gasoline marketer, which introduced a reformulated 
gasoline in April in the nine smoggiest cities, is studying upgrades at six of 
its seven refineries -- a process that will take years and cost billions. 
</P>
<P>
MTBE capacity nationally is about 100,000 barrels per day, well short of the 
289,000 barrels expected to be needed for gasoline consumed in the nine 
smoggiest cities as required under the proposed revisions, said Roy Sugimoto, a 
researcher with the consulting firm DeWitt &amp; Co. in Houston, which tracks 
MTBE projects. 
</P>
<P>
But 110,000 barrels per day of new capacity is already planned, and 
construction on several plants could begin within the next year or two at an 
average cost of $160 million to $180 million per plant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tenneco is planning one of the new MTBE plants -- a 12,500-barrel-per-day 
facility to be completed in the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of an additional five to six projects of similar size now being 
planned in the industry and expect that between eight and twelve projects could 
be built in the United States by 1994 to meet growing octane and clean-air 
demands," Tenneco executive Michael Falco wrote in a letter to Sen. Thomas A. 
Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat who co-wrote the Senate amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it's too early to say whether any of the existing reformulated 
gasolines is taking its market by storm. But early signs are that the fuels are 
winning some public acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Arco says EC-1, being sold in the Los Angeles area to former customers of its 
leaded regular gasoline, has been gaining market share slowly each month and 
now accounts for about a third of the leaded regular market in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
That performance is particularly good given that the regular leaded market is 
declining, Arco's Babikian said. 
</P>
<P>
Have the new gasolines had a measurable effect on air quality? Again, it's too 
soon to tell. California air quality officials confirm Arco's claims that EC-1 
would cut pollutants from older cars by about 20%. But clean-air advocates 
agree that the current reformulated gasolines are only a first step. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea how clean you can make a refined petroleum product," said 
David Hawkins, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group. "And I'm not sure the industry has any idea either."

AIMS TO DISPEL THE STEREOTYPE OF HIS PEOPLE AS NOBLE SAVAGES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting prim and proper in the shadow of Smithsonian Castle, it's hard to 
picture W. Richard West in the full tribal regalia of his Cheyenne tradition: 
paint strewn across his cheeks, eagle feathers in his coffee-brown hair, 
buckskins and moccasins in place of his current pin-stripes and penny loafers. 
</P>
<P>
Rick West has traveled a long way from his family's log cabin to reach this 
sun-soaked day, looking out through the bay windows of his Washington Mall 
office -- contemplating the first full day of his daunting new Dream Job. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly," says West, smiling and exuding an air of gentle confidence, "I 
can't think of any job I would want more." 
</P>
<P>
This month, the 47-year-old Indian rights lawyer begins work as the newly 
crowned director of the National Museum of the American Indian. It is an 
ambitious $106-million-plus project to be built on the choicest of D.C. real 
estate, next door to the Capitol and the Air and Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
For West, a member of Oklahoma's Cheyenne tribe, this museum sends the overdue 
but welcome signal that American Indians are finally being recognized, he says, 
"as a complicated, rich culture that deserves a prominent place on the Mall" -- 
more than a century after white settlers began herding Indians onto 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress, in doing this, is not motivated simply by guilt," he says, 
"although, you know, guilt is fully warranted." 
</P>
<P>
A Stanford Law School graduate and a veteran Washington lobbyist, West appears 
more accustomed to the power lunch than the peace pipe, but family and friends 
say his roots in the Indian way of life run deep. 
</P>
<P>
Cate Stetson, the only non-Indian partner in West's former Albuquerque, N.M., 
law firm notes with admiration: "I have to deal with two worlds, but I don't 
have to live in both of them. It's a tribute to Rick that he pulls it off so 
well." 
</P>
<P>
West himself puts it this way: "Contemporary Indians realize we live in two 
worlds, and that we have to be equipped to deal with both worlds. But what gets 
us through both worlds is that we are thoroughly grounded in our own culture." 
</P>
<P>
It has, in fact, been his lifelong mission to preserve and promote that culture 
-- a fact not lost on Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams, who in 
announcing West's selection last month praised his "commitment to a deeper 
understanding of the meaning of American Indian life and culture." 
</P>
<P>
West spent his early years on a Cheyenne reservation in eastern Oklahoma, in 
what he describes as a relatively privileged and cultured household amid 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
His Cheyenne father, Walter Richard West, was on his way to becoming an 
acclaimed artist, and his white mother, Maribelle McCrea, was a pianist and 
music professor at Bacone College, a local mission school established in the 
1880s by Baptists, primarily to serve the Cheyenne. 
</P>
<P>
The family -- including his younger brother, Jim -- lived in a four-room cabin 
at a time when most of West's peers still lived in tepees. "The students used 
to come over to our place to learn about what it was like, living in a house," 
West says. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheyenne children were schooled in mainstream American faiths and ways, as 
the missionaries pursued policies of what West characterizes as "wanton 
assimilation." West's 77-year-old father is a Catholic; he is a Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I cannot speak my native language, Cheyenne, is because my father 
could not," West says. "They were not allowed to speak Cheyenne. The nuns quite 
literally banged the children's heads against blackboards who were caught 
speaking Cheyenne." 
</P>
<P>
At age 11, Rick West and his father took a "special pilgrimage" to Manhattan to 
see the Heye Foundation collection of Indian art and artifacts. That journey, 
four days each way by train, proved to be a watershed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have such vivid memories of that trip," West recalls. "Looking up at all 
this beautifully designed, authentic Indian handcraft -- it opened my eyes. 
Some of the ornamented clothing, in particular, had very beautiful beadwork, 
the likes of which I've never seen since. Very beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Not coincidentally, the Heye's 1-million-piece collection will form the 
backbone of the planned Indian museum. Most of it will be moved from Manhattan 
to the new museum's archives and 250,000-square-foot display areas, though an 
exhibit will be retained in New York on a floor of the former Customs House 
near Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick has had an interest in Indian culture from the time we were very young 
and war-danced together," says Jim West, Rick's only sibling, who at age 44 is 
a private financial consultant to more than 150 tribes. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Rick West's success, his brother says, is his character. "By virtue 
of his mixed heritage . . . (he) knows how to build bridges." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Stetson: "It's very, very difficult to say anything bad about Rick because 
he just leaves no room for it. The rest of us have some particularly glaring 
faults, but Rick has none -- and we know him real well." 
</P>
<P>
"If he's got a weakness, it's that he's got almost got no ability to be mean," 
asserts West's longtime law partner and friend in Albuquerque, Kevin Gower. 
"Rather than confront and fight and stir up tension and bad feelings, he's 
willing to walk away and say life is too short. He thinks you win more that way 
. . . by softening the views of others rather than beating them over the head." 
</P>
<P>
West does bridle in his own way, though -- a raised brow here, a chopping hand 
gesture there -- at the prospect of seeing the Indian way of life assimilated 
out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
He chides the media for largely ignoring the Indian community, preferring to 
traffic in romanticized and derogatory caricature, a la James Fenimore Cooper's 
noble savage. He asserts that museums, including the Smithsonian, tend to treat 
Indians as if they were dinosaurs, a mere collection of models and bones. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the American Indian museum was forged in a hostile environment. 
Indian groups for years had protested the Smithsonian's holding of Indian 
remains and burial artifacts in its massive archives. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 legislation that authorized the Indian museum's creation -- subject to 
a $36-million private fund-raising drive that West will head -- also mandated 
the repatriation and proper burial of those remains. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time," West says. "The circumstances under which many of these 
remains were collected -- and ended up in the Smithsonian collection -- are 
very offensive. Some of the remains actually came from battlefields where 
soldiers gathered up the bodies and shipped them off to Washington. Quite 
frankly, that's a terrible, inhuman way for our ancestors to be treated." 
</P>
<P>
He notes his own traditional Cheyenne belief that "unless a body has been 
properly buried, its spirit really never starts on the journey up the Milky Way 
to the hereafter, and simply wanders around lost in the village where it died. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, it is important that the remains be returned so the spirits can be 
liberated." 
</P>
<P>
The "living" museum West envisions will be "part history, part sociology -- a 
slice of Indian life, past and present." He expects that its emphasis on modern 
community and culture as much as its history will embolden the Indian 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Indian leaders -- who have criticized the Smithsonian in the past as a staid, 
ethnocentric institution -- praise West's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Notes Gower: "I've seen simplistic exhibits (at the Smithsonian) suffering from 
a cultural myopia. Words like primitive and savage are used in a denigrating 
way. It's nice that, for the first time, an Indian is going to have a central 
say about how Indians will be portrayed in the nation's most prominent place." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, West is planning exhibits that will highlight current political 
controversies besetting the Indian way of life: violent feuding among Mohawks 
over gambling on their New York reservation; the South Dakotan Sioux's battle 
for U.S. reparations over broken treaties and stolen land; the Amazon natives' 
persecution by developers. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to be hemispheric in scope," West says. "The diversity and beauty of 
Native American culture don't stop at the U.S. border." 
</P>
<P>
The philosophical and intellectual continuity of Indians, too, will be 
showcased, he says, noting that some Indian values are "supremely relevant" and 
gaining credence in the non-Indian world. 
</P>
<P>
"Take what really is one of the driving values of Indian cultural life -- that 
the land is not ours to buy and sell, to be bartered away," he says. "Now that 
sense of balance between us and nature, it can be easily romanticized. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But the concept has a lot of relevance. After all, what has the Juggernaut of 
technology done? It's gotten us polluted air, fouled water, et cetera," he 
says. "You're seeing attention being paid now to values that are inherently 
Indian." 
</P>
<P>
West attended the University of Redlands -- where he was a student leader -- as 
an undergraduate, earned a master's degree in American history at Harvard and 
graduated from Stanford Law School in 1971. He won collegiate honors in legal 
writing and served as a clerk for a federal appellate judge. In 1979, he became 
the first Indian partner in the Washington office of the powerful New York law 
firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobsen. 
</P>
<P>
As an associate, West took a leave of absence in 1977 to teach Indian law at 
Stanford and to help direct the American Indian Lawyer Training Program in 
Oakland. He returned to the firm in 1978, but after nine more years in 
Washington lobbying for Indian interests, in and out of court, his firm phased 
out its Indian accounts, West says, in favor of more profitable clientele. 
</P>
<P>
He had a choice: Take up corporate law full time, or leave his hard-fought 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, West uprooted his family for Albuquerque, to become a partner in what 
soon became Gover, Stetson, Williams &amp; West, a firm whose attorneys devote 
their time exclusively to tribal affairs. It is the nation's largest American 
Indian-owned law firm. 
</P>
<P>
He played an integral role in the firm, becoming its president this year. 
</P>
<P>
This made the news that West would leave, effective June 1, to take the 
$115,000-a-year Smithsonian job bittersweet for his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible," says co-worker Stetson, only partly in jest. "The news came as 
a big thump in my heart. . . . With Rick leaving, I'd feel sick if I didn't 
feel so proud." 
</P>
<P>
For the next year or two, West plans to commute on weekends from Washington to 
New Mexico. His wife, Mary Beth -- who attended Stanford Law School with Rick 
and today is an expert in international law -- is obliged to stay a year as a 
law professor at New Mexico State University. His 15-year-old daughter, Amy, is 
vehement about finishing high school in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
As for his 12-year-old son, Ben: "He hasn't got a choice. He's coming out 
here," West says, punctuating the remark with a chuckle and a shake of the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, this isn't going to be an easy move. This is a permanent career change, 
though. . . . It will be the better part of a decade before this museum is even 
up." 
</P>
<P>
And of that expected opening day in 1998, what happens then? 
</P>
<P>
West turns away from his desk to gaze out the windows of his office. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans," he says deliberately, granting each word its own emphasis, "will 
see the richness and diversity of historical and contemporary Indian life -- as 
they have never seen it before. It won't come overnight. But we'll do it."

INNOVATION: KAZUO INAMORI FOUGHT THE ODDS WITH CERAMICS MAKER KYOCERA. NOW THE 
COMPANY IS HELD UP AS A MODEL FOR THE QUALITIES JAPAN MAY NEED IN THE 
INFORMATION AGE.

KYOTO, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 58, Kazuo Inamori stands at the pinnacle of success in Japan's business 
world. As founder of Kyocera Corp., Inamori pioneered high-tech ceramics, 
shepherded the firm to leadership in that market and secured a reputation as 
one of Japan's visionary leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But he did it as an outsider, with his nose pressed against the window of 
Japan's best schools, companies and business networks. 
</P>
<P>
Inamori's story of rags to riches is as American as Horatio Alger. He 
contracted tuberculosis at 13. He lost his home and family factory to wartime 
air raids. Initially, other Japanese firms refused to buy his ceramics. But he 
persisted, traveling to the United States in 1967 and convincing semiconductor 
maker Texas Instruments to give him orders for the Apollo space project. It was 
his first big break. 
</P>
<P>
Now Inamori's pioneering spirit is winning public admiration in Japan. As the 
nation strives to foster the creative, free-thinking researchers needed for the 
Information Age, it is turning for lessons to this maverick maker of ceramic 
microchip housings. Last year, in a survey of 15,000 Japanese executives by the 
influential Japan Economic Journal, Kyocera was named the company with the 
greatest potential in the 21st century. In two Nikkei Business surveys since 
1983, Inamori was named Japan's most effective manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Even today, our venture spirit continues, and people look at Kyocera as 
innovative and creative," said Inamori, projecting charisma during an hour-long 
interview. But, he added, "It would be wrong to think we are now in the 
mainstream. The majority of people are still going in a different direction." 
</P>
<P>
From the start, Inamori has tried to imbue Kyocera with his own innovative 
spirit. He was just a 27-year-old ceramics engineer when he quit his job to 
start his own company in 1959. He raised $40,000 from private investors, 
becoming one of Japan's first start-ups funded by venture capital. The risk -- 
and challenge -- were clear. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured with such a small company, the only way to get major clients was to 
do something out of the ordinary, to develop products nobody was able to make 
or supply," the Kyocera chairman said. 
</P>
<P>
The products are a high-tech twist on the 6,000-year-old art form of ceramics. 
Like potters centuries before them, Kyocera workers mix clay from alumina, 
silicon and other materials found in almost limitless supply in the earth's 
crust. But the finished products are leaps beyond pots and vases. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine 4-inch-square ceramic sheets etched with the circuitry to house the 
brains of a jet control system. "Bioceramic" bones and teeth the body won't 
reject. Ceramic engines so impervious to heat that they recently test-ran the 
equivalent of Los Angeles to Boston at 100 miles per hour -- nonstop. The 
high-tech know-how comprises 70% of the product cost, the ceramic powder only 
5%. 
</P>
<P>
Kyocera is also busily transforming itself. Three years ago, the mercurial 
Inamori decided his company was getting too big and sluggish. So he spun off 
his 11 North American divisions from the parent company's subsidiary, Kyocera 
International Inc. The divisions were told to "create your own vision," said 
Rodney Lanthorne, KII president. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Inamori answered critics who dismissed Kyocera as a one-product 
company little known outside Japan. With the acquisitions of U.S. electrical 
component makers Elco Corp. and AVX Corp., the $2.5-billion firm added $600 
million in sales and 21 plants in Europe, Southeast Asia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Kyocera's new long-distance telephone company is booming, popularized by novel 
adapters that automatically route calls to the cheapest line. It is leading 
research efforts into new ceramic materials that transmit electricity with no 
resistance, a phenomenon called superconductivity that could sharply reduce 
energy bills and pack supercomputing power into a laptop machine. On the 
horizon are a filmless camera and a solar-powered car. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't always go into businesses that are immediately profitable, and that 
has bothered some people," said Matt Aizawa, vice president of Merrill Lynch 
Research International in Tokyo. "But it is an extremely entrepreneurial 
company willing to take risks with related businesses that are promising." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond innovative products, Inamori also created a new management technique: 
the "amoeba." 
</P>
<P>
Like the one-celled animal, the Kyocera "amoeba" is meant to be a 
self-sufficient operating unit. Amoebas may be organized around a product or 
production process and range from a few people to hundreds. They are given 
considerable independence to manage their own operations in an effort to 
instill the entrepreneurship and "marvelous sense of cost-consciousness" 
characteristic of small businesses, Inamori said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts credit the amoebas with helping Kyocera turn in one of Japan's 
strongest corporate financial performances. Its return on equity is 6.9%, 
compared to the Japanese average of less than 4%. Its ratio of pretax earnings 
to sales is 20%, more than three times the Japanese average of 6%, said 
Masahiko Goto of New Japan Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Like many self-made business people, Inamori is eager to impart his philosophy 
of success. Detractors in Japan sneeringly call it "Inamori Kyo" or Inamori 
Scriptures. A collection of his speeches and writings has just been published. 
The firm once employed a "company missionary" to spread the good word. 
</P>
<P>
A seeming mixture of Zen Buddhism and Norman Vincent Peale, the creed stresses 
maximum effort, self-sacrifice and the power of positive thinking. Inamori's 
ideas often find expression in simple maxims. His writings include sections 
entitled: "Make Goals That Continue Limitlessly Into the Future," "Strong 
Desire Must Penetrate Deep Into Our Subconscious Mind," and "Be Conscious of a 
Higher Purpose." The rewards envisioned are more spiritual than financial. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the philosophy means individual freedom for maximum creativity in 
the lab, but disciplined teamwork for quality products in the factory. An 
esprit de corps, which Inamori calls "a bond of human minds," is constantly 
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
A culture of total devotion and discipline isn't as strong in Kyocera units in 
the United States as it is in Japan, where employees salute their factory 
leader and run to their offices from their morning meetings in a company yard. 
In Kyocera's San Diego plant, which manufactures multilayer ceramic packages 
and other products, employees are encouraged to bond through twice-weekly 7 
a.m. meetings. The meetings include pep talks, company news and morning 
stretches. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone -- including Kyocera America President Kiyohide Shirai -- wears 
company blue jackets. Inside, walls have been knocked down and partitions 
removed. Almost everyone, from executives to clerical staff, sit together in 
long rooms. Company lawyers are the few employees with private offices. 
</P>
<P>
Not all workers share the zeal, however. A recent Japanese news article 
reported that more people were leaving Kyocera because of too much overtime. In 
addition, the Japanese offices are having a more difficult time attracting 
recruits, said William Everitt, vice president of communications in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Kyocera has had other problems. The firm folded its line of audio equipment 18 
months ago after years of losses. Although the products were an "audiophile's 
dream," Everitt said, there wasn't much demand for $3,000 ceramic turntables 
and other high-end stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Kyocera is struggling with its optics group seven years after acquiring ailing 
Yashica Corp. Last year, it reported an operating loss of $11 million. Its 
Samurai camera, an innovative vertical model that fits two pictures on one 
frame, won awards when introduced two years ago. But sales have not taken off. 
</P>
<P>
Those difficulties underscore what many regard as Kyocera's greatest failing. 
It may make innovative products, but not enough people hear about them. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, mass marketing and distribution weren't particularly necessary. 
The company's core business, computer chip packages, is tailored to individual 
customers. Many of its other products are made for private labels. For 
instance, Kyocera built the world's first mass-produced portable computer, but 
you'd never know it. It was marketed as a Tandy Radio Shack. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the technology, but our weakness is bringing it to market," Lanthorne 
said. "You have to be patient. Kyocera is not a household name." 
</P>
<P>
Despite continued losses, the firm has managed to parlay the Yashica optical 
and precision technology into laser printers, copying machines, microscopes and 
scanners. It has grabbed 50% of the European market for laser printers. 
</P>
<P>
Kyocera's acquisition of AVX and Elco has been widely hailed. AVX is a 
$409-million-a-year producer of tiny storage batteries called ceramic 
capacitors, while Elco sells $152 million worth of electrical connectors a 
year. Together, they give Kyocera a firm foothold in the components market, 
distribution prowess and eight new plants in Europe, one in Southeast Asia and 
12 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisitions also helped Kyocera broaden its product base, insulating it 
from the swings of the semiconductor industry. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest triumph, though, is Kyocera's entry into Japan's telecommunications 
market. Just as deregulation of the U.S. telephone business opened the door to 
MCI and other long-distance competitors, deregulation of Japan's 
telecommunications market in 1985 led to the establishment of four new 
long-distance carriers. Kyocera is the largest shareholder -- with a 25% stake 
-- in the Daini Denden telephone company. In just five years, Daini Denden has 
sprinted to lead the pack in long-distance revenue and earnings. Its strategy: 
Target the profitable Tokyo-Osaka corridor and use microwave systems, 
considerably cheaper than fiber-optic lines. 
</P>
<P>
Daini Denden has also been awarded cellular telephone franchises covering half 
the Japanese population. As a result, Merrill Lynch's Aizawa predicts that 
telecommunications could eventually become the company's largest source of 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The market has applauded the moves. Kyocera's share price has risen 56% since 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
Lanthorne said the firm also expects payoffs from its ventures into solar power 
systems and the medical market. Kyocera has produced the market's most 
efficient solar-powered battery; a prototype solar car capable of traveling 100 
miles a day, depending on the sunlight, and solar power stations that are 
bringing running water and electricity to remote villages in Pakistan and other 
developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
"After apparently futile diversification efforts, some benefits are actually 
starting to come through," said Alan Bell, deputy head of research for Baring 
Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. "They've been through hard times, but they've 
worked through them." 
</P>
<P>
Inamori developed that survivalist spirit in his hometown of Kagoshima on the 
island of Kyushu -- a place known for its feisty people. 
</P>
<P>
Kazuyoshi Kamioshi, a scholar and specialist on modern Japanese leaders, said 
Kyushu is renowned for what "must be the best fighters in Japan." During the 
early 1600s, in the Tokugawa period, they led a two-year resistance against 
persecution of Christians. During the Meiji Restoration, in the late 1800s, 
local hero Takamori Saigo led Kyushu natives in a major rebellion against 
government policies. 
</P>
<P>
Inamori's grandfather peddled ice treats, but his father ran a profitable 
printing business. In 1945, however, U.S. air attacks destroyed the Inamori 
home and factory and threw the family back into poverty. That same year, at 13, 
Inamori contracted tuberculosis, then considered a "death disease." 
</P>
<P>
After recuperating, Inamori decided he wanted to be a pharmacist, but failed 
Osaka University's medical school exam. He wanted to work for a big company, 
but his alma mater -- Kagoshima Prefectural University -- wasn't prestigious 
enough for the status-conscious giants. He was rejected for job after job. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he went to work for Shofu Industries Ltd., a maker of high-voltage 
insulators. When the firm decided not to start a ceramics division, Inamori 
launched Kyocera with seven colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies accepted his products more readily than the tightly knit 
Japanese business world. That first order from Texas Instruments in the late 
1960s for electrical resister rods led to orders from General Electric and 
Westinghouse -- and they helped establish his credibility in Japan. Eventually, 
Kyocera commanded 64% of the world market in its core business of ceramic 
microchip packages. 
</P>
<P>
"It is easier to break into the U.S. market," Inamori said. "The Japanese have 
the nationalism that values traditions and history. On the other hand, the 
Americans admire good quality and accept the superior technology and products 
without persisting in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Inamori said there are deep-rooted historical reasons why Japanese society has 
not engendered the kinds of individual freedom and leaps of intuition that 
produce creative breakthroughs. In a rice-growing culture, he said, group 
effort is critical. Taking risks with cultivation could spell starvation for an 
entire village, he said, instilling a reluctance to gamble that persists today. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, Japan's culture of craftsmanship, based on an 
apprenticeship system, teaches the art of copying. Whether wood-carving, flower 
arrangement or tea ceremony, the "first thing is to be humble enough to copy 
and master exactly what the teacher is doing," Inamori said. Only after you 
master the art can you become an innovator. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just as many creative Japanese as Americans. The problem is when 
people have an inspiration in one society, the people can freely speak out. In 
the other, that idea is suppressed," Inamori said. "In Japan, if someone comes 
up with an idea that is not traditional thinking, people tend to say that 
person does not have his feet on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"That social environment has to change before there can be personal creativity 
in Japan."

FORMER RAM GREAT COWAN GETS NO HELP FROM THE NFL AFTER KIDNEY FAILURE, BUT OLD 
FRIENDS COME TO HIS AID

<P>
Charlie Cowan, a former 270-pound blocking machine for the Rams, is now tied 
down to different apparatus three times a week. In the failed kidney business, 
you love your machine or move on, as a friend of Cowan's recently proved. 
</P>
<P>
"He told them to get him off the machine so they had to take him off," Cowan 
said. "He got tired of the routine. They can't force you to stay on the 
machine. He went to Texas. And died. He felt it wasn't worth all this 
procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan, whose kidneys quit working two years ago, couldn't spell "dialysis" when 
doctors first described the machine of so many tubes and knobs that would 
become his constant companion. Now, he knows more than he wishes to about 
kidneys: stones, transplants, renal failures, donors, complications. He knows 
the kidneys are a pair of glandular organs in the upper abdomen that separate 
water and waste products from the blood and excrete them as urine. When they 
fail, a machine must take over the job of filtering. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan, who retired after the 1975 season, played 15 years at guard and tackle 
for the Rams. He played in 206 games, only two fewer than franchise leader 
Merlin Olsen. Cowan was more mountain than man, at 6-foot-4 and 270 pounds, 
dominating defensive ends in an era of restrictive, no-hand, chicken-wing 
blocking techniques. If he plays today, Cowan probably is another Anthony 
Munoz, the Cincinnati Bengals' monster tackle who makes $500,000 per season. 
Cowan earned $12,000 in his 1961 rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
So you think timing isn't everything? In today's game, Cowan maybe stashes 
enough money to absorb the runaway medical costs that have consumed his family 
since a routine trip to the doctor two years ago to treat what Cowan believed 
to be flu symptoms. Before he knew it, his ailment was diagnosed and he was 
introduced to the dialysis machine to which he would be strapped three times a 
week, four hours per session, for as long as he lives, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
His lifestyle, to say the least, was permanently cramped. Cowan's kidneys 
failed over a period of years, he says, damaged irreparably by the high blood 
pressure medication he'd been taking for as long as he can remember. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan's weeks are best described as filling voids between dialysis treatments 
just completed and those upcoming. Out of town trips? Oh, sure. Not long ago, 
Cowan planned an excursion to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to start 45 days before," he explained, "setting up a clinic in Vegas so 
I could do dialysis while I was there. You're definitely tied to it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a pile of bills mounts in the corner. Cowan, 52, collected them 
recently and measured them at a thickness of 1 1/2 inches, estimating the costs 
in excess of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
His two insurance companies, Medicare and F.H.P. (Family Health Plan), are in 
the process of sorting through his mess to determine who's going to pay for 
what, and how much. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever they don't cover falls into Cowan's lap. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the big question," Cowan said. "How much are they going to pay? I 
really don't know. What is my percentage?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Cowan can't take much of a hit. Dialysis has reduced him to a 
part-time employee handling automobile extended services contracts at a Newport 
Beach company. 
</P>
<P>
The National Football League, his employer for 15 seasons, only shrugs its 
shoulders toward Cowan and hundreds of others in similar situations. The 
league's pension plan is, frankly, deplorable when compared to other sports. 
Cowan could have taken early retirement at 45 and received $500 per month at 
the price of losing his disability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan can wait three years and receive full benefits of $900 per month at age 
55, but that money applied to his expenses is not unlike fighting an oil fire 
with a water pistol. 
</P>
<P>
"I checked into it once, and it's nothing," Cowan said of his NFL pension. 
"It's too depressing to look forward to that." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan was shocked when a former Angel player told him recently he would make as 
much money per year from his pension, about $60,000, as when he was playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Cowan said. "My mouth was open. And he's not walking 
around with zippers in his knees." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan's insurance premiums alone have increased to $900 quarterly. He doesn't 
like thinking about losing his Fullerton home, where he resides with his wife, 
Irene, and one of his three daughters, Cecilia. But he does. 
</P>
<P>
"It has crossed my mind with all the medical expenses," he said. "Somehow, 
we've always managed to work our way through." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan's fortunes turned for the worse last October, after it appeared a 
successful kidney transplant would mean a return to normalcy. Potential 
recipients lead a strange existence, waiting by the phone for someone to die 
and leave behind their healthy kidney, so that it might save the life of 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan's call came Halloween night from UC Irvine Medical Center in Santa Ana. 
There was no time to spare. Kidneys don't last long, and Cowan was rushed into 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"All I knew was that the kidney came from a young lady that was in a car 
accident," Cowan recalled. "She was 16 or 17 years old. It was a great kidney. 
They put it in there and in 10 minutes it was working. And it worked for 10 or 
12 days." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Cowan was to be released, though, he began experiencing stomach 
pains. Minutes later he was rushed into emergency surgery to repair a ruptured 
colon. 
</P>
<P>
"I had popped a big hole in my colon, they said about an inch," Cowan said. "My 
waste was going to spread throughout my body. And then it's over. It was 
something we had to do to save my life." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan is hesitant to speak of his colon problems, believing the rupture may 
have been caused by steroids he was taking to neutralize his system before the 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Donald Martin, chief of urology and kidney transplants at UCI Medical 
Center, said the steroids are needed to suppress antibodies that would attack 
the new kidney. 
</P>
<P>
"The immune suppressed state is exposed to all sorts of infections," said 
Martin, who performed Cowan's transplant. "It's part of the risk patients 
accept when they undergo a transplant." 
</P>
<P>
The complications forced the removal of a perfectly good kidney. 
</P>
<P>
"When they took it out, it was still working," Cowan said, almost proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's back to square one, except that colon surgery has taken an exacting 
toll. Cowan's weight has dropped from 270 pounds down to 212 since surgery. He 
wants to try another transplant next fall, but can't risk it until he regains 
his strength. However, Cowan has to watch what he eats to protect his system. 
For instance, he can't eat foods high in potassium. 
</P>
<P>
"The body gets rid of potassium through the kidney," Dr. Martin explained. "And 
too much potassium stops the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Some days, Cowan can get out of bed only long enough to collect the latest 
round of medical bills from the mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
With little financial assistance from league offices and player associations, 
professional football players can only turn inward and try to help their own. 
Jack Faulkner, the Rams' director of football operations, went to work to 
organize former teammates to raise money for Cowan. Faulkner had taken similar 
action a few years back when former Ram Clancy Williams was dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"When football players are in trouble, they'll come out just like that," 
Faulkner said. "They have no help from the NFL, they don't care about former 
players. I called everyone I could get a hold of." 
</P>
<P>
And they turned out in force for a January benefit auction at Rams Park. Merlin 
Olsen, Dave Elmendorf, Eddie Meador, Tom Mack, Joe Scibelli, Jack Snow, Lamar 
Lundy, Deacon Jones; some teammates Cowan hadn't seen since his playing days. 
Faulkner's goal was to raise $25,000 to purchase a home dialysis machine for 
Cowan. They raffled off jerseys, footballs, vacations, dinners and anything 
else that might draw a bid from well-wishers who paid $25 for admission. 
</P>
<P>
Ram owner Georgia Frontiere purchased a Joe Montana jersey for $2,400 and one 
from her own quarterback, Jim Everett, for $2,000. Faulkner pieced together 
some film clips of Cowan, just in case some had forgotten what a force the 
three-time Pro Bowl selection had been on the field. Cowan, a fourth-round pick 
from New Mexico Highlands, was also quite versatile. He entered the league as a 
guard and played both right and left tackle during his long career. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was a great football player," Faulkner said. "And he never complained 
about anything. He could play." 
</P>
<P>
Courtesy of the Anaheim police, Cowan was flown from his Fullerton home to Rams 
Park in Anaheim, via helicopter, which landed on the team's practice field. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after, Cowan tearfully embraced Scibelli, his buddy at guard for many 
years. Both players retired in 1975 and hadn't seen much of each other since. 
Scibelli is suffering from cancer, and had surgery shortly before Cowan. They 
were still doing things together. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe what I was seeing," Cowan remembered of the night. 
"That people, after all those years, would still remember an offensive 
lineman." 
</P>
<P>
They remembered to the tune of nearly $65,000, more than double what Faulkner 
was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner is hoping someday to raise enough money to fund a home for retired 
players left disabled by poor health and poor pensions, to be modeled after the 
Screen Actors Guild for retired actors. He estimates it would take $5 million 
to get the project started. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan, in the meantime, has been pricing home dialysis machines, but is holding 
out hope for another transplant, which would liberate him from his unpleasant 
tri-weekly ritual. The one-year survival rate of an outside (not a blood 
relative) source kidney transplant is 80%. Cowan doesn't think he'll end up on 
the short end twice. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the obvious life restrictions of dialysis, the process also weakens 
the patient because it causes anemia, a blood condition that is eliminated 
through a successful transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest difference is the quality of life," Dr. Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Once a towering giant of force and talent, Cowan's body has betrayed him. But 
his spirit has not waned. 
</P>
<P>
"From day one I've said, 'What can we do?' " he said. "I've had some awful bad 
days, but I never let myself get depressed. I've been frustrated, very much, 
but then I work my way through it." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan says the discipline of professional football has helped him through his 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years of training you learn to deal with the negative," he said. "You 
learn to accept the negative and reverse it. Early in my career, the offensive 
line took the brunt of everything. It was our fault if we lost football games. 
You start learning to deal with those type of things. Now I'm dealing with 
something similar, except we're talking about life and death."

<P>
Here's an Earl Strom story he doesn't tell on the banquet circuit: 
</P>
<P>
It's 1987. Strom and Dick Bavetta are en route to officiate that night's 
Laker-SuperSonic game in Seattle when they meet a reporter Strom knows from the 
old days. Strom offers him a ride. In the car, they joke about Earl's stormy 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen your name in any headlines lately," the reporter says. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," says Strom, "I've mellowed." 
</P>
<P>
The reporter later learns that a week before, Strom and Bavetta had worked 
another game during which they argued in their dressing room at halftime. 
Strom, then 59, emphasized his point by grabbing Bavetta by the throat and 
choking him. 
</P>
<P>
In this fat-cat era of the NBA, it's hard to remember how it was in 1958, when 
Earl -- Yogi to his friends -- Strom came out of Pottstown, Pa., to officiate 
in the big carnival. 
</P>
<P>
When Strom worked his final game last week and said goodby at a news 
conference, it served as a welcome reminder of the time before $125 sneakers 
and the Master Lock Defensive Player of the Year; when personality was just 
something you had, rather than something hawked through your agent; and when 
the league was more bush and maybe, if you weren't the one being choked, more 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by those masters of the imperial sneer, Sid Borgia, Mendy Rudolph and 
Norm Drucker, et. al., the young Yogi arrived brimming with the requisite 
courage, but his defiance had a flip side. He had a bad habit of trading gibes 
with hecklers. Gregarious to a fault, he was just having fun, but sometimes he 
wound up going into the crowd to see who was funniest. 
</P>
<P>
He had a genius for the impolitic move. He had a courtside fight with a St. 
Louis Hawk official. He jumped to the fledgling ABA in the 1960s, earning 
himself a permanent black mark with the NBA hierarchy. He worked during the '77 
officials' strike, straining relationships with the few comrades he had in this 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Thus isolated, he lasted only . . . 32 years. He retires as one of the most 
respected and popular referees in NBA history -- a living, breathing dinosaur 
from the age of giants. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I think I'm the last of a dying breed," he says, at 62 his eyes flashing 
behind tinted lenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly believe that. I'm the last of the group that was around when I came 
in. I'm the last of the guys who think differently than what is thought today." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, 1958. 
</P>
<P>
President Eisenhower, bobby socks and NBA franchises in places such as 
Syracuse, N.Y., where crowds of 6,000 in the Onondaga War Memorial feasted on 
black-and-white striped officials, and a huge fan called the Strangler was once 
said to have picked up referee Charlie Eckman by the neck and dangled him off 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters at courtside tables often snarled at officials for calls against 
"their" teams. The money was meager. The officials all knew better than to quit 
their day jobs. Until well past mid-career, Strom worked for General Electric 
in Philadelphia and tried to make it into work the morning after working games 
in Baltimore or New York. 
</P>
<P>
Only the strong survived, to be tested again the next night. 
</P>
<P>
"Alex Hannum," Strom says, naming the coach of the Nationals, Hawks, 76ers and 
Warriors. "He used to goad you and incite the crowd with his demonstrative 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd jump up at Syracuse, and those people didn't need any provocation up 
there. I mean, they were ready to come at you with both barrels. He'd stand up 
and hold his bald head in his hands, and the place would come down on you. I 
mean, everything in the place that wasn't nailed down was thrown. I wouldn't 
tolerate it, so I'd scream at him or throw him out. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point that Alex used to say, 'I'll take Strom on the road. I 
don't want him at home.' 
</P>
<P>
"That started it. Some of the other coaches said that. More coaches said that. 
And I'd say to my boss, 'These guys got to stop it, because somebody's got to 
be home. I got to have a job. I got to referee somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
This is part of Strom's legend, his status as the visitors' favorite. 
</P>
<P>
But it's only part. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of stupid things," he says. "Like diving over the table to get at 
Irv Gack one night in Memphis. Irv was the assistant general manager of the St. 
Louis Hawks. They were playing the 76ers. I called a play against Richie 
Guerin, their player-coach, and wiped out a goal. The 76ers won the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The game was being televised to Philadelphia. Matt Guokas Sr. (father of the 
current Orlando Magic coach) was doing the TV. The game was over, of course, 
the fans were irate, and I walk by the scorer's table to go to my dressing 
room. Irv looks at me and says, 'You gutless bastard!' 
</P>
<P>
"I stupidly said to him, 'Would you like to repeat that?' He stupidly did. I 
leaped over the table to grab him. I would only have done it with Irv Gack, 
because he was a little bit heavier than I was. I wouldn't do that to somebody 
who could whip me. 
</P>
<P>
"The camera was on me. In Philadelphia, my wife and five children are sitting 
in the living room, watching this idiot jump over the table. 
</P>
<P>
"With that, Wilt Chamberlain walks by. The fans were starting to come out of 
the stands around me. Wilt steps over the table, picks me up and says, 'C'mon 
Earl, let's get the hell out of here.' 
</P>
<P>
"The camera's still on us. Matt Guokas says, 'It looks like Earl Strom is in 
some sort of trouble. But we'll see you next week.' And they go off the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I got back to the hotel. I usually called home collect. I heard the operator 
say, 'Will you accept a collect call from Memphis from Mr. Earl Strom?' My wife 
says, 'Will I? Put him on!' I got cold-tongued for half an hour. Tremendous 
phone bill for getting cold-tongued. But I stopped doing stupid things. Of 
course, I was fined for that also." 
</P>
<P>
Strom was the Charles Barkley of the referees. He says his fines went up to the 
$10,000 he paid for critical remarks about then-Chicago owner Jonathan Kovler 
in Strom's newspaper column. It ran in the Reading (Pa.) Eagle, and he learned 
another invaluable lesson, about how the wire services link up those newspapers 
and get you in trouble -- again -- with the supervisor in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Strom never quite lived it all down. He was an ace referee and drew top 
assignments, but the coveted job of supervisor went to Darell Garretson, who 
stayed when Strom jumped to the ABA. 
</P>
<P>
Strom stifled his natural rebellious streak only with difficulty. In 
retirement, he says he opposes the zone-defense rule and three officials, wants 
a no-foul-out rule and TV replay in key situations such as the Clipper game in 
which he mistakenly ruled Charles Smith's three-point goal a two-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
In general, he wants to let the players play and suggests that college-style 
officiating is sneaking in on inexperienced arbiters' sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
But Strom managed to hold his tongue in recent years. Several years ago, he 
watched his close friend, Walt Peters, an 18-season NFL linesman who'd dreamed 
of working the Super Bowl, dying of cancer in the psychiatric ward of 
Philadelphia Pennsylvania Hospital. Peters was strapped to the bed because he'd 
tried to commit suicide and couldn't talk, but he wrote Strom a note. 
</P>
<P>
Strom, remembering it at his farewell news conference, broke down. The note 
said, "I'll never get the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Strom says he decided then and there that his work would never be all-important 
to him again. 
</P>
<P>
Give or take an incident here and there, it hasn't been. 
</P>
<P>
One thing about Strom, he was what he was. Then, too, consider what he was up 
against. 
</P>
<P>
Say, Red Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a pretty good rapport with Red," Strom says. "Contrary to a lot of 
articles you read and contrary to a lot of pictures you saw. Red once said to 
me, 'I can't stand referees, but if I got to have a referee on the floor, I may 
as well have you.' I took that as a compliment.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of course, after the pivotal Game 4 of the 1987 Laker-Celtic NBA finals, which 
Magic Johnson won with his junior skyhook, Auerbach chased Strom all the way to 
his dressing room and not to tell him how much he respected him, either. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me a few uncomplimentary names. He started cussing and telling me . 
. . that I was a eunuch. He wasn't particularly happy with me. He was really 
screaming and yelling, and I just leaned out the door -- Red doesn't care for 
the name Arnold -- and stuck my head out and I said, 'Arnold, you're showing me 
all the class I always knew you had.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that really infuriated him. I heard him kicking the door a few more 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"But I truly think the game misses the Red Auerbachs. I do. I love the man." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA began turning down requests to interview Strom in his final season 
several months ago. The board of governors was opposed to a referee talking. 
Modern officials are supposed to be anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA, while still enforcing the gag rule, made Strom available to its 
cable-TV partner, Turner Network Television, for a sanitized feature on his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
And so Strom came to his last NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of great ways for a legend to retire. His crew's last tough 
call -- Danny Young's too-late three-pointer in Game 4 -- was an after-the-fact 
committee job that was correct, but gave Portland Coach Rick Adelman something 
else to complain about. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get the ball," Strom said, laughing. "When all the tumult 
occurred, I thought, 'I better run for my life and try to buy a ball later.' 
</P>
<P>
"You know what, it was ironic to be chased off the floor. There were so many 
years when I was chased off the floor. But it was fun." 
</P>
<P>
The Portland trainer brought him the ball. Strom joked that he wasn't sure if 
he'd gotten it from the Trail Blazers or the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
That was how he went out, laughing, which wasn't ironic, but appropriate.
