A BOYHOOD IN THE PAST PERFECT;

<P>
The best prescription for a happy childhood is a bad memory, Charles Champlin 
remembers someone saying. And when we consider 20th-Century fiction, all the 
Joyces and Lawrences and Wolfes, it is sometimes hard to bear in mind that 
countless human beings remember their childhoods precisely and fondly, 
sometimes even as the best part of their lives. Perhaps it is true, as Pound 
remarked, that hatred, rather than love, is more often the driving force of 
literature. Perhaps contented souls are less tempted to take up their pens. 
</P>
<P>
All the more reason, then, to be grateful to the Garrison Keillors and Charles 
Champlins in our midst. Hammondsport, N.Y., has been to a still-unfinished 
series of Champlin columns in the Los Angeles Times what Lake Wobegon, Gateway 
to Central Minnesota, has been to Keillor's monologues on American Public 
Radio. But whereas Keillor has tried to sight his childhood mythically, as if 
it were a constellation in the heavens, Champlin, sticking to the discipline of 
fact, keeps his earthbound. 
</P>
<P>
Champlin's Hammondsport is set in the Finger Lakes of New York's Southern Tier 
in what must be the most underratedly beautiful landscape in the Northeast. And 
though Hammondsport is small-town by anyone's standards, it has long had 
connections to the larger world, both as a center of aviation (local scion Glen 
Hammond Curtiss flew the world's first seaplane over Keuka Lake) and, more 
anciently, a wine-making district and home to the vineyards of Taylor and Great 
Western (a Champlin family enterprise). 
</P>
<P>
The picture Champlin paints for us is modest, grave, and yet, at this distance, 
almost fantastic. In towns like Hammondsport, the '20s never roared, and the 
'30s, though they wiped out savings, did not erase the simple rituals of 
civility: the uncles in their dignity, the aunts bustling quietly, the 
dedicated maiden-lady teachers, the gang down at the gas station, the little 
railroad, the bandstand in the park (and the cars that honked their 
appreciation at Saturday-night concerts in summer), the humble movie theater, 
the many-layered preparations for Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas, the 
importance of the churches. Champlin remembers a way of life that flourished in 
this country from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of World War II. It 
was a life dependent on small details and small pleasures, and, except for the 
inventions of auto, aircraft and cinema, a life that seemed like one continuous 
woven cloth. "No one," writes Champlin, "who has not tended a coal-burning 
furnace -- shaken its grates, started it from scratch when it went out, 
shoveled its ashes (and lugged them to the street), been enslaved to its hourly 
needs, learned to bank the fire so it would last the night -- no one who has 
not coped with these mystical rites has experienced life fully." 
</P>
<P>
I am especially grateful to Champlin for his elegiac evocations of 
French-American and German-American family life, as represented by his mother's 
family. It seems to me that, like the beauty of the Southern Tier, the 
contributions of these two ethnic stockpots to the flavoring of American 
culture have long been ignored, in favor of louder and brasher contributors. 
The Germans, in particular, who bestowed upon us such characteristic American 
products as frankfurters and lager beer and who raised the Catholic Church in 
the Midwest to a level of civilization that the Irish and Italian immigrants in 
the East rarely approached, have been undervalued. How very much poorer would 
our Advents and our Christmases be without their genius for festive ornament 
and domestic conviviality. 
</P>
<P>
Champlin is hardly an aggressive writer, and, given the contemporary style of 
verbal overkill, it is easy to miss his quiet effects: the "root-heaved 
sidewalks"; the "semaphore eyebrows" of his aunts; that all adult family 
friends were "aunt" or "uncle"; that every other man in Upstate New York seems 
to be known by the initials of his first and middle name. 
</P>
<P>
Today Hammondsport boasts much less in the way of locally owned business. The 
vineyards were consumed by Coca-Cola, then by Seagrams, then by a management 
group called Vintners International. The local bank is now "the least branch of 
a vast conglomerate financial institution." The local telephone company is a 
memory only. Champlin mentions twice the contemporary phenomenon of 
homelessness, which bothers him greatly. I wonder: Is our loss of local control 
over our own destinies anesthetizing us to the "lost" members of our society? 
Does the loss of a sense of place (even in urban neighborhoods) mean that the 
homeless belong nowhere and to no one? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is hard to imagine a contemporary father writing to his son as 
Champlin's great-great-great-grandfather Sam Baker wrote: "Now Richard, as you 
lay the foundation so will the building be strong or weak. One thing I would 
impress on your mind -- it is much easier to be what you would wish people to 
think you are than to make them believe you are what you are not. It is very 
easy to practice Justice, Mercy and Love and Truth but very hard to make people 
believe you are an honest man without being in reality such." 
</P>
<P>
I have often thought that what this country really needs is a "Dictionary of 
Outmoded Terms" to help us remember all the lost experiences that had once been 
crucial to everyone. I am thinking of nouns like privy and groaner and 
adjectives like square (as in "square meal" and "square deal" and "square 
guy"). But in "Back There Where the Past Was," Charles Champlin has given us a 
"Book of Outmoded Experiences" to help us remember our past and enrich our 
present and future.

RICHARD EDER: ON THE SPOOR OF GRAHAM GREENE; 
</P>
<P>
THE LIFE OF GRAHAM GREENE VOLUME I: 1904-1939 BY NORMAN SHERRY (VIKING: $29.95; 
783 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In securing Graham Greene's approval to write this biography, Norman Sherry 
tells us, he promised the novelist that he would retrace his arduous journeys 
through the more rugged parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Risking disease and death as he had done," he writes, ". . . I made journeys 
to Mexico (where I contracted dysentery in exactly the same mountain village, 
living in the same boarding house as he had done), Haiti, Argentina, Paraguay 
and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"In Liberia, a week after I had left that most corrupt of countries, during a 
revolution led by Sgt. Doe (now general and head of state), the previous 
corrupt leader was murdered and his supporters shot or had their throats cut. I 
had only recently interviewed some of these men." 
</P>
<P>
There is something grandiloquent and faintly absurd about this. If Sherry had 
tackled De Maupassant would he have felt obliged to contract a venereal 
disease? Does talking to government officials who were subsequently murdered 
really constitute risk of death? 
</P>
<P>
Boastfulness does not disqualify a biographer; Leon Edel is not a shrinking 
violent; neither was the late Richard Ellmann. But presumably boastfulness 
would be earned by the writer's perceptiveness and literary gifts; not by his 
blisters. The sad truth about this massive biography -- only the first of two 
volumes -- is that its energy is mainly physical. No doubt, those were hard 
trips; they seem to have done more for Sherry's self-confidence than for his 
insight, which is crude, or his writing, which is ungainly. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry's book describes Greene's comfortable but uneasy childhood as one of the 
children of the headmaster of Berkhamstead School, and later as a student 
there. It takes us through a mysterious adolescent breakdown, a course of 
treatment with a London psychoanalyst, his days at Oxford, his courtship, 
conversion and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
It tells of his life as a struggling and frequently failing young writer; and 
of the early successes -- "Stamboul Train" and "This Gun for Hire" -- which, 
sold to Hollywood, allowed his family to live with a little more ease. It goes 
on to describe the writing of "Brighton Rock," a religiously tinged thriller 
and his first masterpiece; and of his expeditions to Africa and to Mexico. It 
ends with 1939 and "The Power and the Glory." 
</P>
<P>
Greene chose Sherry, the latter tells us, partly out of admiration for a book 
he had written about Joseph Conrad. At the same time, Greene wrote a friend 
that his biographer-to-be "has the great advantage of not knowing me." 
Considering that Greene was reluctant to have a biography done at all, and only 
gave in at the urgings of relatives, the phrase has an odd ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose it is far-fetched to suggest that the elusive writer, noted for 
privacy, chose Sherry because he sensed convenient qualities of obtuseness in 
him. But it is remarkable how little, despite 12 years work and thousands of 
miles traveling, Sherry has managed to get beyond what Greene has already 
chosen to put out about himself. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's grueling trek through Liberia, for example, in the company of a young 
cousin, is vividly related. But the telling seems mainly to be a paraphrase of 
Greene's own book on the subject. The footnotes for these chapters largely 
consist of citations of "Journey Without Maps" followed by chains of 20 or 25 
ibids. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the chapters dealing with the writer's trip to Mexico draw most of 
their substance from Greene's "The Lawless Roads" and his novel, "The Power and 
the Glory." The results of Sherry's travels are relatively meager, though 
discussed at length and ploddingly. Sherry finds the old man whose toothy look 
inspired Greene's physical description of the Judas figure in "Power and 
Glory." It is quite a jump, though, to assert that this makes him the model for 
the character. 
</P>
<P>
In his research, Sherry had access to Greene's diaries (with an occasional page 
torn out), to a great deal of unpublished correspondence, and to interviews 
with friends and relatives. He also had a number of talks with Greene himself. 
These are curiously unreflected in the book; hardly ever do we get a reference 
to something Greene told the author. "You are grilling me," Sherry quotes him 
as complaining; if so, the heat was on low. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most striking new material is Greene's letters to Vivien 
Dayrell-Browning before they were married. He met her while at Balliol and fell 
violently in love. She was cool for a long time, but began to soften after he 
converted to her Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
The temper of the letters makes it clear that whatever else went into Greene's 
conversion -- one that would shape his most important writing later on -- Eros 
was at least as important as Grace. His, you might say, was a baptism under 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear one, Darling heart, marvelous wonderful adorable one, Angel, Loveliest in 
the world, Sweetest heart, Dear only one for ever, sweet one, old thing, dear 
desire," goes one courting passage. Later, trying to overcome her resistance by 
proposing a celibate marriage, he writes: 
</P>
<P>
"And there'll be winter evenings, when we can make hot buttered toast for each 
other (do you like roast chestnuts? I do), &amp; there'll be summer days with 
the sea sparkling blue . . . &amp; days on the town, &amp; night expresses, and 
evenings sometimes, when we are both sleepy and tired &amp; we'll just read, or 
I'll write &amp; you'll put in a few touches to a design." 
</P>
<P>
It is not what we tend to think of as Greene's prose style. But after a few 
samples -- and long before Sherry exhausts what perhaps he regards as his 
richest trove -- the letters lose their relevance. After all, the meaning a 
love letter has for writer and recipient is not the meaning it has for a third 
party. In effect, we're reading a flawed translation. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental defect in this biography is not a matter of sources, nor a lack 
of assiduousness nor an overbalancing use of what Greene himself has written. 
It is in the mediocrity of the biographer's thought and style. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Greene as a baby: "His infancy went according to nature's and man's 
plan. For four months he was fed at his mother's breast." As a child: 
"Childhood and the innocent eye are temporary." Later on: "The world was not as 
he imagined." Crying at sad stories: "Perhaps this imaginative sympathy with 
the predicaments of others helped to make him a novelist." 
</P>
<P>
Describing a student prank -- Greene and a friend dress up as Gypsies and play 
a barrel organ on the street -- Sherry sees far-reaching implications. Greene 
was "challenging accepted principles, and experiencing life outside the bounds 
of society's protection, which involved hardship and danger (on a minor scale 
as yet), secrecy and disguise." 
</P>
<P>
As for the topographical accuracy of Brighton Rock, Sherry tells us that "what 
Hale observed in the Grand Hotel so must Greene have observed: They were 
drinking cocktails on the terrace." 
</P>
<P>
He also writes that Greene "was antipathetic to Mexico" (he didn't like the 
place); and that ". . . there are times when he smiles, with his transparent 
blue eyes giving an impression of blindness, when he unquestioningly looks 
beatific." Unquestionably. 
</P>
<P>
Only those who admire Greene's writing are likely to want to read a biography 
that may fill 1,500 pages when it is finished. And few who admire Greene's 
writing are likely to put up with Sherry's.

A CANTICLE FOR KIRGHIZIA; 
</P>
<P>
THE PLACE OF THE SKULL BY CHINGIZ AITMATOV; TRANSLATED BY NATASHA WARD (GROVE 
PRESS: $20.95; 310 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Clark, Berkeley writer Clark's latest novel is The Exile of Celine 
(Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This unusual and highly uneven novel, powerfully evocative of place, is set in 
remote regions of Central Asia that will seem as exotic to most Western readers 
as distant planets: the Issyk-Kul Ridge of Kirghizia, a wild upland country of 
treacherous, forbidding glaciers and ravines, and the vast steppes of Moyun-Kum 
in neighboring Kazakhstan, in summer a bountiful, sun-baked expanse of wild 
grasses, reigned over by noble birds of prey and grazed by fleet saigak, or 
antelope, and in winter a desolate, "boundless white ocean, frozen in waves." 
</P>
<P>
It is a deep love of these lands, along with a strong faith in the redemptive 
power of unorthodox Christian religious beliefs, that forms the basis of values 
used by 61-year-old Soviet novelist Chingiz Aitmatov -- himself a Kirghiz 
native son -- as a platform for this extended moral tract in the form of a 
novel. Hailed in the West as a progressive literary breakthrough made possible 
by the new freedoms of expression brought on by glasnost (and excerpted by Time 
for its putative controversial content), "The Place of the Skull" is in fact, 
and in method, far more traditional than modern, laden with sermonizing and 
severely limited by old social realist narrative modes. The strength of the 
book lies not in its political critique, but in its moments of poetic vision, 
contained in passages of lyric response to the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
The book is divided into two complementary parts, titled "Man" and "Wolf." At 
the outset of "Man," Aitmatov follows the fortunes of a she-wolf and her mate, 
driven by man's intrusions out of savannah hunting grounds whose beauties are 
limned in an uplifting prose disclosing the novelist's evident familiarity with 
and affection for the pristine wilderness of the Moyun-Kum. 
</P>
<P>
"In that evening hour a whole flock of white-tailed kites was circling high 
above the earth. They flew smoothly and aimlessly, simply for the joy of it, in 
the faint haze of the cool, cloudless heights. Round and round they circled, as 
though to symbolize the eternal stability of the land and of the sky, silently 
observing the life down below them on the earth. Thanks to their exceptional, 
omnipotent vision (their hearing is vastly inferior), these aristocratic birds 
of prey live their whole lives in the heavens above the savannah, descending to 
the sinful earth only to eat and sleep." 
</P>
<P>
The vantage soon descends, however, to that sinful Earth. Breaking into the 
peaceful natural paradise is a raiding party of armed mercenary roughnecks in 
jeeps and helicopters, dispatched by local officials to top off the regional 
Five-Year-Plan meat quota by slaughtering the saigak. Caught in the ensuing 
stampede, the wolves' cubs are crushed, the parents wounded and forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
The only one of Aitmatov's human intruders to approach the wild lands with an 
interest not arising from sheer rapacity, a deacon's son and former seminarian 
named Avdiy Kallistratov, becomes the focus of the action through the remainder 
of the book's first part. A self-appointed, well-meaning ethical crusader bent 
on the moral reformation of a band of teen-age drug smugglers, Avdiy joins 
their expedition into the steppes to gather anasha, the wild cannabis plant 
that grows there in profusion. When his companions discover his motive is not 
the profits of the weed but his own obscure idealism, they beat him up and 
fling him from a speeding train in the middle of nowhere. At this point the 
persecuted Avdiy is seized by a vision of Christ conversing with Pontius 
Pilate. The scene carries obvious echoes of the Christ-Pilate confrontation in 
Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita" and seems to confirm a link with 
Dostoevsky as well (though Aitmatov's Christ-like Avdiy, it must be said, is 
drawn with little of the subtlety of his famous Russian forerunner's saintly 
Alyosha). 
</P>
<P>
Rescued and recovered, Avdiy is briefly consoled by a comely scientific 
researcher who shares his hatred of anasha (in fact she's employed in a 
government campaign to eradicate the "evil weed"). But their romance ends when 
a misunderstanding bred of a missed rendezvous leads to his rash enlistment in 
the saigak hunt, which proves as disastrous for him as for the defenseless 
antelope. 
</P>
<P>
In "Wolf," the setting shifts to the Issyk-Kul mountains, where the migrating 
she-wolf and her mate are found dwelling in uneasy proximity to local 
shepherds. Here Aitmatov introduces a second main character, the "model worker" 
Boston Urkunchiev. Urkunchiev, another goody-good with an earnest 
conscientiousness to match Avdiy's religious fervor, clashes with the 
inflexible head of the state collective farm. The latter figure refuses his 
request for private grazing lands and colludes with Noigutov, the teetotalling 
Urkunchiev's envious, vodka-swilling rival, to bring about his downfall. There 
is one last fatal encounter between man and wolf, after which the reader is 
left to ponder the "eternal riddle of why evil almost always triumphs over 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Human evil and virtue are indeed Aitmatov's chosen protagonists, but his human 
characters come off seeming hardly more real than cartoon stick-figures, and 
his true heroes, righteous intentions aside, are the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the principal message put forward in Aitmatov's preachings -- a stern 
injunction against contemporary people's wasteful, foolhardy and thoughtless 
defilement of the Earth, and of each other -- is a commendable one. The problem 
with "The Place of the Skull" is that the message is given entirely too much 
sway over the novelistic medium, unfortunately (and ironically) turning the 
latter into its own kind of oppressed beast of burden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 -- From "The Place of the Skull" 
</P>
<P>
Daylight brought a slight thaw, brief and elusive as the breath of a child, on 
the south-facing slopes of the mountains; then, imperceptibly, the weather 
changed: the wind blew down off the glaciers and a penetrating darkness stole 
up the ravines, trailing behind it the cold pearly-grey of a snowy night ahead. 
Snow was everywhere. The whole length of the Issyk-Kul ridge lay buried by the 
blizzard that had swept through a couple of days before with the wild rage of a 
forest fire. Such storms could be a terrifying thing, as the snowy darkness 
swallowed up mountains, sky and the whole of the visible world. Later the 
raging ceased, and a clearer sky broke through. Since then the mountains had 
stood in frozen silence, imprisoned and isolated from the rest of creation by a 
mantle of ice. 
</P>
<P>
The only sound was the growing roar of a heavyweight helicopter, cutting up 
through the canyon of the Unzun-Chat to the frozen wastes of the pass at 
Ala-Mongyu, half visible in the evening light and the curling wisps of cloud; 
closer and louder it grew, until at last, triumphant, it filled with its 
thundering clatter the ridges and peaks, the untouched snows where the only 
trespassers were light and sound. Echoing off the rock-safe and the screes, the 
sound grew with such inexorable power that the mountains seemed poised for a 
repeat of the recent earthquake, remembered with horror by all in those parts. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly something cracked and a stony slope, denuded by the winds, directly 
beneath the path of the helicopter, started to move. Shuddering as the 
sound-wave reached it, a bank of scree ran down but was quickly stilled, like 
the flow of blood at the utterance of a charm. So unstable was the surface, 
however, that even this small movement was enough to send a few of the heavier 
stones crashing down the slope, gaining speed, raising dust and chips in their 
wake, until they burst at the foot like canon-balls through the bushes of 
krasnotal and barberry, and tunneled through the deeper drifts to thunder down 
onto the roof of a lair which the grey wolves had burrowed out in a cleft 
beneath the overhang, tucked between a thicket and a small, half-frozen but 
gradually thawing spring.

I enjoyed "I Know My First Name Is Steven," the TV movie about Steven Stayner, 
not only because it was emotionally touching but because instead of finishing 
with a storybook happy ending, as many movies do, it dealt with the hard and 
painful problems he had to face once he returned home. In fact, the problems he 
had to deal with once he was home again were almost as difficult as when he was 
a "captive," as he was not only cruelly teased but had to get used to living an 
entirely new life style.

I'm grateful that I saw Howard Rosenberg's enthusiastic review and took on the 
12-week commitment of "Game, Set and Match" on "Mystery!" Ian Holm's 
performance was so masterful that after one of his brilliant scenes, I found 
myself applauding the screen for the first time in 35 years of avid TV viewing.

Sure, it took a reported half-million dollars in java money from Maxwell House 
to get Ellerbee -- a former network star and now a CNN commentator -- to team 
up with "Today" show weatherman Willard Scott for a series of TV ads being 
broadcast around the country. 
</P>
<P>
But everybody, after all, has their price. 
</P>
<P>
And besides, Ellerbee has explained, she needed the money for her production 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerbee isn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
PBS' venerable "This Old House" was almost torn asunder recently when producers 
at WGBH in Boston decided that host Bob Vila's cache of endorsements had 
undermined the show's editorial foundation. Vila, with 10 years of TV exposure 
under his work belt, is now free to nail down as many endorsement contracts for 
Time-Life how-to books and hardware store chains as he pleases. 
</P>
<P>
Are Vila and Ellerbee letting America down? 
</P>
<P>
Probably. 
</P>
<P>
We could understand it when rock stars, never known for taking the moral high 
ground, traded in their counterculture nights to Michelob. 
</P>
<P>
But the Maxwell House ads, which normally have been perfect satirical fodder 
for a tongue-in-cheek tirade from Ellerbee, open up a whole new arena of 
marketing opportunities for TV news stars. 
</P>
<P>
With penny-pinching honchos at the networks and legitimate ex-network newsies 
popping up in all manner of syndicated schlock, the Ellerbee commercial may be 
only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, for instance, what Walter Cronkite, friend of the environment, sailor 
and, of course, "the most trusted man in America" (even if it was a decade or 
so ago), could do for a chemical company trying to clean up its image. Picture, 
if you will, what the merging of these two worlds, news and advertising -- 
already on more than friendly terms in TV news -- will look like. 
</P>
<P>
Director to Cronkite: "So, Walter, can I call you Walter? Did you bring that 
sailor cap? We just gotta have the cap or we lose Maine, you know, all those 
sea states. They're killing us. Front office wants 'em off our backs, and you, 
Wally babe, you're gonna do it for us, aren't you? Look at that face (He gives 
Cronkite a light and loving slap on the cheek). Is that a face? Put on the cap, 
Wally. MUSIC!" 
</P>
<P>
Edvard Grieg's familiar "Morning" is playing. Somewhere, too, we can hear -- or 
maybe are merely imagining -- birds chirping. Cronkite, in sailor's cap, is 
standing before a breathtaking sea view of Martha's Vineyard. His back is to 
the camera, which comes up from behind and, like some unseen friend, taps him 
on the shoulder. Cronkite turns and says . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Good evening, I'm Walter Cronkite." 
</P>
<P>
"CUT! Look, Wally, babe. I know you're new at this, but look around you. It's 
daytime. I thought you said you had this stuff down. You're tense. Loosen up. 
And next time, try not to be so serious, OK? You're scaring the kiddies and . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
All right. Maybe that's a bit much but can't you picture a TV news glamour gal 
like Diane Sawyer a few years down the road pitching for Lady Clairol? 
</P>
<P>
She'd be in her Manhattan apartment, head tilted to one side, 20 strokes into a 
comb-out. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi. I'm Diane Sawyer. Is your hair ready for prime time? You know, you don't 
have to be in television to have beautiful hair. And you certainly don't have 
to make a career out of it. In fact, it's a snap. How long does it take? (She 
tilts her head to the other side, coyly). Just 60 minutes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe news anchor Mary Alice Williams, formerly of CNN and now of NBC, for 
American Express: 
</P>
<P>
"Hi. Do you know me? I'm a network news anchor, but a lot of people still don't 
know it -- especially when I stack my mail up next to Connie Chung's. That's 
why I always carry my American Express card. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, all four network news divisions -- CBS, ABC, NBC and CNN 
-- might someday succumb to the ultimate temptation, the one made famous by 
radio news commentator Paul Harvey, where news and commercials are almost 
indistinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
And so, some evening in the hopefully distant future, we may tune in to the 
national news and hear a reporter say, "Peter, the United States declared war 
today. (Pause.) A war on bad breath." 
</P>
<P>
Never happen, right? 
</P>
<P>
No respectable news organization or newsman would do such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
Would they?

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: RAPPING THE GIFTS; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER YEARS ON THE RECEIVING END, A MAN MAKES HIS PRESENTS KNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AS A MAN who has almost everything, I have decided that I don't want anything 
more. 
</P>
<P>
I may not have quite everything, but I certainly have everything that I want. 
</P>
<P>
I am making this position public because I want to impress its seriousness upon 
all of my loved ones -- especially my wife. 
</P>
<P>
She likes to buy things for me that she thinks I need. She is convinced that 
(1) I don't know what I need, (2) I'm too shiftless to buy it for myself, or 
(3) I'm too cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, I own a stationary bicycle that remains exactly that: stationary. 
</P>
<P>
By design, it not only does not move from place to place, but its pedals never 
turn. I tried working them once or twice, but I found the exercise too boring. 
</P>
<P>
Then my wife bought me a small color television set that I could watch while 
exercising. 
</P>
<P>
I found nothing to watch during my exercise hour but cartoons and boring 
variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
The television set now sits at the end of the kitchen counter. If I happen to 
be watching a sex-and-violence movie in the living room while my wife is 
preparing dinner, she watches the same show on the kitchen TV set. That way she 
keeps apace with my cultural enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
When I complained of being bored while working out on the rowing machine on my 
three mornings a week at the gym, she bought me a compact disc player and a 
clutch of discs. It worked fine for a while. I listened to Beethoven and Mozart 
while I imagined I was rowing across the Hellespont. 
</P>
<P>
Then my instructor took me off the rowing machine and put me on the treadmill. 
It is not practical to listen to a CD player while walking on the treadmill. So 
my wife bought me one of those little radios that is concealed in a set of 
headphones. 
</P>
<P>
I found the tuning knob too tiny to turn with accuracy, but by chance I got it 
fixed on KFAC and enjoyed classical music for a while. But I left it on between 
visits and the battery is dead. I haven't had enough desire to buy a new one. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, she bought me a telescope, which I suspect was expensive. One 
night, from our house in Baja, I saw Saturn, with its rings, through it. I was 
thrilled. However, I have never found Saturn again, and the telescope sits 
unused. 
</P>
<P>
Once or twice I tried focusing it on the windows of our neighbors' houses 
across the canyon, but I felt guilty about that and gave it up. 
</P>
<P>
My wife's most recent gift to me was a fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
As I foresaw, it has been of little use, though I was thrilled one morning to 
see that David Hockney was sending me copies of some of his work. 
</P>
<P>
A few times I have received material from The Times' library, but I would say 
the fax is not paying for itself. The only communication I've received in weeks 
is an ad from some fax repair and supply company. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, the United Parcel Service man brought a large package that 
turned out to be a machine that I can pedal to exercise my legs while I'm 
working at my computer or watching television. Unfortunately, it came 
unassembled. 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, after a frustrating three hours trying to put a microwave stand 
together, I swore never to assemble anything ever again. Selling things 
unassembled ought to be against the law. The next thing you know they'll be 
selling us cars in a carton with a screwdriver and a wrench and a set of 
directions written in "Japanenglish." 
</P>
<P>
I live in constant anxiety that my wife is going to buy me something else. 
What's left? All I can think of is a telephone for my car. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the things I don't want, a telephone for my car would come first. I 
think the idea of making telephone calls while you're driving on the freeway is 
insane. And the idea of receiving telephone calls while you're driving on the 
freeway is worse. Driving on the freeway is stressful enough without holding a 
conversation with someone who isn't there. 
</P>
<P>
But who knows? Maybe when I retire, I can watch the neighbors through my 
telescope while I'm using the pedaling machine to exercise my legs -- if I can 
get my wife to assemble it.

WHEN WORDS (AND IMAGES) COLLIDE; 
</P>
<P>
WITH PRIVATE JOKES AND SILENT SNICKERS, 'DADA AND SURREALIST' EXHIBIT SPEAKS IN 
A LANGUAGE ALL ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Virtually everybody in these parts drives more than they want to. This 
necessity creates a lot of down time waiting at traffic signals which, at 
least, offers a chance for reflection. 
</P>
<P>
I was tooling back from the County Museum of Art after looking at its new 
exhibition, "The Dada and Surrealist Word-Image," when a piece of felicitous 
serendipity in the real world seemed to unlock the whole show. The vehicle in 
front of mine was a Toyota pickup. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which runs through Aug. 27, is an exceptionally nice assembly of 72 
small works by artists as renowned as Marcel Duchamp, Joan Miro and Rene 
Magritte, plus others as interestingly obscure as Robert Desnos and Georges 
Hugnet. Icons of the period on view include such familiar images as Duchamp's 
mustachioed Mona Lisa and Magritte's "This is Not a Pipe." 
</P>
<P>
One can pleasurably view it all without a thought in his head, but the show has 
been planned to put one there -- several, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by associate curator Judi Freeman, the exercise comes with a slim 
catalogue containing her perfectly straightforward essay plus another by John 
Welchman, a professor of visual arts at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
That is where the trouble starts. 
</P>
<P>
Welchman is evidently a votary of the current academic and literary fashion for 
criticism, which he calls "post-structuralist." These folks are into analyzing 
the relationship between words and the things they stand for plus the social 
and political context that brings them together. They often conclude that 
verbal language and picture language are used by the social power structure as 
tools to manipulate poor little rubes like us. 
</P>
<P>
All of this will sound familiar to anyone who has seen the current "Forest of 
Signs" exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, which deals with today's 
version of the same idea. The LACMA show can be seen as providing part of the 
historical background. 
</P>
<P>
Welchman, like most such critics, has some interesting if predictable ideas. 
But they are couched in such cryptic and abstract jargon that the interpreter 
of the exhibition winds up needing an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I am stuck in coagulated traffic behind a Toyota pickup truck. 
Staring wearily at the tail-ends of other cars is not usually much fun. You 
find yourself wishing auto manufacturers would design more interesting endings. 
Some kindly drivers try to spiff up their boring backsides with bumper stickers 
and vanity license plates that are only fitfully amusing. 
</P>
<P>
But this Toyota pickup reflected one of the rare poetic successes among these 
attempts to counter rear-end ennui. The owner of this rig had put his spray can 
to work erasing four flanking letters until all that was left -- smack in the 
middle -- was a nice cheerful YO. 
</P>
<P>
At first, YO seems less a word than a sound. Artists in the word-image 
exhibition used written language the same way. Miro put "Ah!" and "HoO" into 
one painting. Most of the words in the artworks are in French or German, and 
often they are fragments, so for English speakers they are just sounds. Artists 
of the period were still interested in the the French Symbolist poets' idea of 
making art that mixed sensations usually separated -- the vision of painting, 
the sound of music, the texture and bulk of sculpture, the spatial depth of 
architecture. Significantly, a number of the artists -- such as Robert Desnos 
-- are better known as poets. He refers to the poet Paul Eluard in one work, 
and Duchamp refers to the poet Guillame Appolinaire in another. 
</P>
<P>
Despite turgid catalogue rhetoric, the general feel of this show is 
lighthearted and playful. We know that not because we necessarily understand 
the language, but because we hear its music and see its letters as expressive 
shapes in painting like any others. There is no mistaking the lyricism of 
Miro's handwriting or the ironic authority of an embossed brass plate in a 
Duchamp. 
</P>
<P>
YO! The tailgate hails us back to the real world. Right. Like the tailgate 
maker, these artists wanted the feel of everyday life in their art, its chaos, 
cheerful vulgarity and anonymous mystery. Collage was the best way to capture 
that. Kurt Schwitters incorporated old tram tickets, Raoul Hausmann got the 
clout of newspaper headlines, Georges Hugnet played with sexual kinks in 
paste-ups from adverts that suggest eros-for-sale and ransom notes. 
</P>
<P>
YO! Isn't that a way of saying hi in current argot? Don't you conjure the 
rippled, sweaty image of Sly Stallone? It's definitely the first-person 
singular of the Spanish language. The tailgate is a way of turning a common 
mass-produced object into something personal. It does so by changing something 
familiar into something enigmatic. In the same way, the artists slow and focus 
our gnat-like attention span by turning the commonplace into the mysterious. 
But to what end? The tailgate wants to impress the guys with its macho -- a 
toughness that comes from an ironic vandalization of a symbol of corporate 
authority. What once belonged to Toyota now belongs to YO. It wants to impress 
the girls with its wit and nonchalance. And there is no way to separate the 
meanings of the sound-word-image. It's all one statement right down to it's 
fat, assertive lettering. YO, bro. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the exhibition reeks with laconic antisocial cool, private jokes 
directed at The Boys and sexual innuendo that swaggers and snickers at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Duchamp's mustachioed reproduction of the Mona Lisa mordantly vandalizes the 
world's most revered symbol of Great Art and the feminine mystique. He turns La 
Gionconda into an ordinary bimbo with his title, "L.H.O.O.Q.," which means 
"Elle .a chaud au cul," or "She has a hot . . ." oh dear. Well, speaking of 
tailgates. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Francis Picabia used words to make a clear comparison between mechanical pumps 
and women. He paints one and labels it "Voila La Femme" (There Is the Woman). 
</P>
<P>
Picabia paints some spermy shapes and calls it "The Ivy Unique Eunuch." In "The 
Pine Family," the obscure Ithell Colquhoun shows three truncated and castrated 
torsos. Magritte was interested in a whole arsenal of ideas about the 
differences between illusion and reality, but they often took the form of 
labeling a tree "nude woman," an empty mirror "sad woman," or a brick wall 
"woman's body." 
</P>
<P>
The sexual obsessions of these artists form a kind of interpretive crossroad 
that wanders off variously. We can think about simple chauvinism or return to 
classic cliches about artists as sensitive souls with larger-than-average doses 
of the traits of both genders, but that doesn't seem to bear on this 
theoretical exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
What does seem pertinent is the realization that metaphor can cut both ways. If 
a severed tree branch can symbolize castration, then castration can symbolize 
something else. In the big picture, the dilemma of the modern artist has been 
that history lopped off his traditional function. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 20th Century, the artist's job was to portray and celebrate his 
society's beatific vision -- tribal artists celebrated ancestral spirits, Greek 
artists trumpeted godlike humans, Christian artists worshiped the Holy Trinity 
and Renaissance artists promoted class power. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising swiped the beatific vision in modern consumer society. (It also 
cribs most of its fresh ideas from the fine arts, but that's another issue.) 
The gorgeous illusion of a paradise of products may be vulgar and silly, but it 
is our version of heaven. We consume it on the telly with the rapt enchantment 
of pilgrims before a cathedral's stained glass. We adhere to its laws like 
converts. If I have no body odor, the Blessed Lady will love me. If I drink 
light beer, I will be a Herculean Hero. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody who scorns advertising as an artistic and cultural force is just not 
paying attention. At best, it's gorgeous, powerful stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, so-called fine artists, rendered impotent by this phenomenon, have 
cast about for a way to regain their chops. Clearly the artists of LACMA's 
word-image and MOCA's "Signs" exhibitions are trying to wrest the Grail of 
word-plus-image back from advertising -- which is its most brilliant 
practitioner and probably its originator. 
</P>
<P>
But why then? And why now? This may seem a bit far-fetched, but the 
incorporation of the French language into art came at a time when French was to 
begin losing its cachet as the language with cultural clout. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that the artists intuitively annexed it as an act of preservation? 
Could it be that modern art -- despite its reputation as revolutionary and 
advanced -- is at least in part an agent of tradition? Of course it is. 
</P>
<P>
If Dada and Surrealist art loaded French onto its Noah's Ark of cultural 
prestige, then wouldn't it make sense that the artists of "A Forest of Signs" 
are doing the same for English? 
</P>
<P>
Seems absurd. The English language is vibrant, the second language of the whole 
world, spoken by more people than any other tongue, ever. 
</P>
<P>
I'm beginning to wonder if the guy in the Toyota lives on my block. He keeps 
staying in front. Can't pass for traffic. Turn on the radio. Humph. "The 
MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." Change the station. You can't just listen to that 
show; you have to watch it. Seems imperative. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's it. Maybe all languages are becoming second languages to the 
lingua franca of our time, that riveting combination of words and pictures that 
speaks louder than all of them. Maybe word-works fine art -- despite contrary 
motives -- will finally act as reminder of a more gracious time when written 
and spoken languages by themselves were marks of cultural attainment. 
</P>
<P>
The first time you saw "Ma Jolie" lettered into a Picasso painting, didn't a 
thought waft shadowy across the back of the mind, and didn't it say, "Gee, if a 
genius like Picasso uses French in his painting it must really be a classy 
language"?

HOW DID MILT MCCOLL, NFL PLAYER AND ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON, COME TO MIRROR HIS 
DAD'S LIFE SO PRECISELY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE GREEN, Lee Green, a Ventura writer, is a frequent contributor to this 
magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ON THE TURF of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, at an L.A. Raiders game last 
fall, outside linebacker Milt McColl -- 6-foot-6, 230 steel-cased pounds -- was 
just another faceless warrior sporting the silver and black, an oak among oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Three months into the off-season, in the crowded emergency room at San Jose's 
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, he is somewhat more conspicuous. Part of it 
is his musculature -- a white lab coat doesn't quite conceal the kinetic body 
so painstakingly honed to create mayhem in the NFL -- and part of it is his 
height. He looms over his medical colleagues, more so because he stands so 
erect, beeper clipped to one coat pocket, "Manual of Emergency Medicine" 
protruding from another, obligatory stethoscope slung around his neck. Very 
doctorly. Doctorly and big. 
</P>
<P>
In his eighth-grade yearbook, Milt McColl wrote that he hoped to become a 
professional athlete. No surprise. Just about everyone who knew Milt knew that 
his old man had played pro football. Four years later, Milt's senior classmates 
at South Hills High School in Covina voted him "most likely to succeed," and he 
was asked to pose for a yearbook picture in career attire. He showed up wearing 
surgical scrubs and wielding a butcher's knife. No surprise. Everyone knew that 
Milt's dad was an orthopedic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Milt won a football scholarship to Stanford, his father's alma mater; pledged 
Zeta Psi, his father's fraternity, and starred on Stanford's football team, as 
his father had done. But as graduation neared, the odds of his life continuing 
to mirror his father's narrowed considerably. Football isn't exactly the most 
accessible profession. Only one player in 30 makes the jump from college to the 
National Football League, and many of those last just long enough for a rubdown 
and a cup of Gatorade. For that matter, medical school has never been mistaken 
for a day on the Seine. Either one, medicine or pro football, is a formidable 
challenge by itself, the achievement of a lifetime for most. To stay on his 
father's path, Milt had to conquer both -- and at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be almost axiomatic: Sons followed in their father's tradition. 
Blacksmiths' sons became blacksmiths, bakers' sons bakers. It's a little more 
complicated now. A banker's son may become a banker, or he may resolve to be 
anything but a banker. Some sons barely know their real father, live under a 
different roof with a different man at the head of the table -- if indeed the 
family sits together at a table. Or a son may know and like his father but have 
no idea what he actually does for a living: "He works for Rockwell -- something 
to do with computers." 
</P>
<P>
For Milt McColl, explanations for having produced a virtual carbon copy of his 
father's life don't come easily. Milt pursued the legacy not at his father's 
urging, nor even upon great reflection, but instead almost instinctively, as 
though guided by providence. He never observed his father in surgery or 
accompanied him on hospital rounds. Milt simply gravitated toward his father's 
achievements like water seeking equilibrium. "Sometimes I think I didn't think 
about it as much as I could have," he says. "It just seemed natural." 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s, Bill McColl earned his medical degree and completed an internship 
and part of his orthopedics residency during an eight-year playing career with 
the Chicago Bears. Milt, too, has played eight years in the NFL: seven with the 
San Francisco Forty-Niners and one, last season, with the Raiders, all the 
while pursuing his medical studies. He became an MD at Stanford in March, 1988, 
taking almost seven years instead of Stanford's norm of four or five, and now 
is nearing completion of his internship. Within the next year he will begin a 
four- or five-year residency -- in orthopedics, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting such an unlikely amalgam of careers might never have occurred to 
Milt had his father not shown what was possible. "I just felt that the way he 
lived his life set a great example," Milt says. "That's why I've wound up doing 
so many of the things he's done. Not because he wanted me to -- maybe he did -- 
but because it just seemed the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
THAT'S ALL a father can do, really -- set an example. And what an example Bill 
McColl set. As a Stanford senior in 1952, he was thinking about play ing for 
the Chicago Bears while studying medi cine at the University of Chicago. A 
two-time All-American who played with fierce intensity, McColl was the scourge 
of any team Stanford opposed, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound powerhouse whose renown 
reached near-mythical proportions during his college career. He played seven 
different positions -- offense and defense -- threw touchdown passes that 
traveled 70 yards in the air and he seemed almost unstoppable when he had the 
ball. A 1951 article in Sport magazine dubbed him "Gibraltar in a red jersey" 
and told of tacklers "bouncing off him like peanuts pegged at an elephant." 
McColl's face adorned the covers of Colliers, Sport and Sport Life magazines. 
The Helms Athletic Foundation selected him as college football player of the 
year. United Press named him lineman of the year. "If a coach had 11 McColls," 
former Stanford coach Marchie Schwartz once commented, "all he'd need to do 
would be to blow up the football." 
</P>
<P>
Bill McColl was selected by the Bears high in the NFL draft, but he had long 
believed that medicine was his calling. His father was a physician, and 
medicine was a proud tradition in the McColl lineage. Technically, he was 
already in medical school at Stanford; the university allowed some students to 
enroll after only three years of undergraduate work. Still, professional 
football held an allure for him, and he wondered if there might be a way he 
could play for the Bears while continuing in medicine.

University of Chicago Chancellor Lawrence Kimpton thought the very notion was 
utterly absurd. In a letter to his friend Richard Balch, Stanford's dean of 
students, Kimpton wrote: "Bill McColl must be nuts. You can't go to medical 
school and play professional football at the same time. It's impossible. 
Anyway, why doesn't he give up the game? There is no future in professional 
football, but the future of the medical profession, unless the University of 
Chicago succeeds in curing all the diseases, is pretty good. When you are in 
medical school -- at least any good one -- you spend all your time on medicine. 
You live it, eat it and think it, and you ain't traipsing around the country 
playing football." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Kimpton was correct about the future of medicine, but he was wrong 
about everything else. While traipsing around the country as the Chicago Bears' 
starting tight end, McColl kept pace with his class at the University of 
Chicago Medical School, becoming an MD in 1955 after three years there. Four 
years later, still serving his residency at the University of Illinois 
hospitals, he retired from football to concentrate on medicine. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, McColl confined his medical studies to the off-season, 
attending school in winter, spring and summer and then skipping the fall 
quarter to play football. But he overlapped medicine and football during his 
rookie season, just as Milt would do 30 years later. Actually, pro football 
would have been unfeasible for McColl had it not been for the Bears' feisty 
owner and coach, George Halas, who was remarkably tolerant of McColl's unusual 
circumstances. Halas even rescheduled the Bears' daily practices from 
afternoons to mornings during McColl's first year so that the sessions wouldn't 
conflict with the rookie's classes. He had no choice but to be tolerant, 
because McColl, before signing his contract (for $12,000, a 
more-than-respectable sum in those days), insisted on a unique concession from 
Halas: Whenever medicine and football conflicted, medicine would take 
precedence. If McColl had to miss a practice or a meeting, or if, as was 
invariably the case, he had to arrive late to training camp, Halas couldn't say 
a word. On only a couple of occasions did the coach entreat his tight end to 
temporarily reverse his priorities, in each case eliciting a reminder from 
McColl: "But George, you promised." And that would be the end of it. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted me bad enough to sign that," McColl says now, with a hearty laugh, 
obviously savoring the memory. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, three years out of football and with his residency completed, Bill 
packed up his wife and their six young children and moved to Taegu, South 
Korea, where for two years he worked as a medical missionary. The young doctor 
divided his time between Presbyterian Hospital and Ae Rak Won Leprosarium, 
where he did pioneer work in reconstructive surgery on leprosy patients. Though 
he received only a subsistence allowance for his services in Taegu, he was 
known to dip into his own pocket to cover medical expenses for people who 
needed treatment but couldn't afford it. He found time as well to make weekly 
trips to the Sungbo-Won Orphanage to visit the children and check on their 
health. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after his return to the United States, McColl was selected by the U.S. 
Junior Chamber of Commerce as one of the country's Ten Outstanding Young Men, a 
distinction he shares with such illustrious previous honorees as John F. 
Kennedy and Leonard Bernstein. Still keenly interested in leprosy research and 
treatment, he is chairman of the board of American Leprosy Missions. He is also 
a member of the college football Hall of Fame and was selected to the NFL Hall 
of Fame for his outstanding "service to humanity." His only significant defeats 
have been political: three unsuccessful bids for U.S. Congress. In a nasty 
primary in Orange County's 43rd Congressional District in 1982, McColl was 
tainted by an opponent's charge of voter registration illegalities. Ultimately, 
the San Diego County district attorney's office exonerated McColl, and a 
Republican Party ethics panel censured his opponent, but McColl hasn't been 
tempted to re-enter the political arena since. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine now, McColl isn't much over his playing weight, and he still moves 
with unmistakable grace. He resides with his wife, Barbara, whom he met at 
Stanford, in a stunning La Jolla home on a palisades overlooking Tourmaline 
Beach. With orthopedic practices in Baldwin Park and San Diego, the doctor is 
still making good use of what he learned in Chicago between Bears games. Of 
merging the rigors of the NFL and medical school, he says, "It's not hard. It's 
a matter of discipline." 
</P>
<P>
BARBARA MCCOLL IS a slender, energetic woman with an impressive record of civil 
involvement and service. If she joins an organization, she usually ends up 
wielding the president's gavel. In this family, she explains, "you're expected 
to achieve." When Bill and his sons used to toss a football around, they did so 
because it was fun but also "because it gets you somewhere," Barbara says. "If 
Milt wants to talk to you, . . there has to be a reason. It's not just to be 
friendly, just to be a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
Milt's wife, Cindy, observes this same dynamic between Milt and his father. 
"They don't just sit together and sort of relax and shoot the breeze," she 
says. "There's always a purpose in what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Bill McColl knows no other approach to life. "That's the way the world is, you 
know?" he says. "We go to church and we go to school and we go out for Little 
League -- if you want. If you don't want to, then you don't. But you ought to 
want to." 
</P>
<P>
Desire has never been scarce in the McColl household. All six of Bill and 
Barbara's children were superb students (one term they all brought home 
straight A's), and all six graduated from Stanford. Four of them have MBAs. 
Duncan, the oldest, was a football All-American and did a brief stint in the 
NFL. John, a year older than Milt, distinguished himself on Stanford's 
volleyball team. Bonnie was a Stanford song girl. Jennifer, the youngest, 
recently entered Fuller Seminary. Only Milt, second-youngest and now 29, found 
his father's shoes to be a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
"God clears a path for the man who knows where he's going," Bill McColl used to 
tell his progeny. That and things like, "The Lord helps the man in motion. But 
if you're sitting on your duff, nothing happens." 
</P>
<P>
"He always described himself as what's called the 'good-enough' father," Milt 
says. "He always was very, very involved with what was going on, but he kept 
his distance. My father has never been one to say, 'I think you should do 
this,' or 'I think you should do that.' Never once did our parents say, 'We'd 
like you to go to Stanford.' " 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, though, the elder McColl must have recommended medicine to Milt as a 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
"I never talked to him about it at all," Bill says. 
</P>
<P>
Football, then. Surely he urged Milt to play football. 
</P>
<P>
A photo caption in a 25-year-old issue of Southern California Presbyterian 
magazine suggests otherwise. The photograph, taken in South Korea, shows Bill 
and his three little boys tossing a football around. "Will there be any more 
All-Americans in the McColl family?" the caption asks, and then it quotes Dad: 
"It's up to the boys if they want to play football. I wouldn't push them into 
it, but I wouldn't say no, either, if the game appeals to them." 
</P>
<P>
BY ALL ACCOUNTS, Milt is not quite the athlete his father was. Even Milt admits 
that. He was named scholastic All-American at Stanford as a senior but was 
ignored when the other All-America teams were named. Worse, he was ignored in 
the 1981 NFL draft because the pros thought he was too slow and lacked the 
necessary bulk. That came as a blow to a young man who had long been nurturing 
the athlete's dream. In high school he just assumed he would take his rightful 
place on an NFL team. "I thought I was a great player," he recalls. "I'd tell 
myself, 'I'm going to play pro football. My dad did it and my brother's going 
to, and I can do it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan, four years Milt's senior, did indeed do it. The Washington Redskins 
picked him early in the 1977 NFL draft, Milt recounts. "And then, all of a 
sudden, two years later, he's not playing any more. I started to realize, 'Wait 
a second, it's not quite as easy as I thought it was gonna be.' " Midway 
through Stanford at the time, Milt played his last two seasons of college ball 
and then wondered which NFL team would give him a shot. When the call didn't 
come on draft day, he was stunned. "I'd always thought I could do it and that I 
had the ability," he says, "but reality sort of sunk in then." 
</P>
<P>
Undrafted players have less than a 1% chance of winning a spot on an NFL 
roster, but as any son of Bill McColl knows, the Lord helps the man in motion. 
So Milt pumped up his resolve and headed for the broiling summer climes of 
Rocklin, Calif., for a tryout at rookie camp with the 49ers, where the staff 
included three of his former Stanford coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Milt's chief linebacker rival was injured early in the camp ("Be prepared to 
make your own luck," Bill McColl likes to say), so Milt found himself playing 
every down, every practice, every day, . . in 100-degree heat. One day he 
walked off the field after the morning scrimmage and collapsed on the 
locker-room floor, bone weary and nauseated. "I looked up at the clock and 
realized I was supposed to be back on the field in an hour for another 
three-hour practice," he recalls. "And I said to myself, 'What an idiot I am! 
I'm not even going to make the team!' " Discouraged, he telephoned "Gibraltar 
in a red jersey." Gibraltar said: Keep working hard. You never know what's 
going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
In one dizzying week, Milt learned he had made the team and had been accepted 
to Stanford Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie camp was easy compared to the schedule that Milt kept during his rookie 
season, when he played football by day and studied medicine nocturnally. A 
typical day: Up at 6:45, breakfast, over to the 49ers' training facility by 8. 
Films, meetings, strategy sessions, scrimmages, films, films, more films. Out 
of there by 5 or 6, quick bite to eat, then over to Stanford to make up for the 
day's missed classes. Specifically, two hours of fiddling with cadavers in a 
deserted anatomy lab, two hours of microscope work in a deserted histology lab, 
two hours of textbook study. Home by midnight or 1, five or six hours' sleep, 
up at 6:45, do it all again. 
</P>
<P>
Head coach Bill Walsh knew that Milt planned to study medicine, but he assumed 
that the rookie would confine his schooling to the off-season. When he learned 
otherwise, he summoned Milt to his office. During the season, Walsh explained 
unequivocally , a professional football player must be completely focused on 
football. The coach stopped short of ordering Milt to shelve medicine until the 
off-season, but his preference was clear. 
</P>
<P>
Milt remembers feeling "pretty blown away" as he left Walsh's office. "I felt 
that if other guys could go out and drink at night, I could go home and study 
medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Discouraged, he telephoned Gibraltar, who said: Be the first guy in every day 
and the last guy out at night. Show them how much you want to play. 
</P>
<P>
Milt took his father's advice, and though he continued to piggyback medical 
school and football, he never heard another complaint from Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Today Walsh remembers Milt McColl as a player who exhibited "a dedication and a 
presence and a state of mind" he has rarely observed in other players. "Very 
few people, athletes in particular, are able to project such time and 
concentration into something and, at the same time, have a parallel career in 
which they're able to give it the same kind of dedication." 
</P>
<P>
Milt moved back and forth between his two worlds like a migrant following 
crops, stressing football in summer and fall, medicine in winter and spring. 
Medical school was often drudgery, and more than once he telephoned his 
"good-enough father" for support and encouragement. Football seasons, on the 
other hand, were welcome escapes. "People in pro football seem to make it out 
as a rough existence," Milt says, "but in the real world -- well, I don't think 
many of them have been in the real world . . . or know what it's like out 
there." In the World According to Milt, pro football is a veritable joy ride. 
"You basically work a 9-to-5 job . . . You're paid really well, you only work 
six months a year . . . It's competitive and you're in the limelight. . . . I 
go into medicine and I'm on call every third night, and I have to spend the 
night at the hospital, and I work from 5 in the morning till 7 or 8 the 
following night . . . about 36, 38 straight hours of work. Sometimes you get to 
sleep, but not always. It's just part of the system. You have to do that to get 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARA VALLEY Medical Center's emergency room is always bustling, in large 
part because, as a county facility, it accommodates San Jose's underclass: 
indigent alcoholics, schizophrenics, drug abusers, the homeless, criminal 
suspects brought in by city police. At 6:15 on a Thursday evening, patients are 
lined up on adjacent gurneys in partitioned treatment bays. Antiseptic and a 
stale, sickly smell suffuse the room as gurneys are wheeled about by the staff 
across ugly green linoleum. A disheveled man in police custody has become so 
unruly that his arms and legs have been strapped to his gurney, and a physician 
is sedating him. Somewhere, a woman is groaning in pain. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Milt McColl, on duty as part of the emergency-medicine rotation of his 
12-month internship, appears oblivious to the distractions as he stands, arms 
folded in front of him, and stares intently at illuminated X-rays of a woman's 
chest. Not much in football translates to medicine, but McColl knows nothing if 
not how to analyze films. The medium in football isn't X-rays, of course, but 
the objective is the same: Determine where and why a system is weak. Sometimes 
it seems to Milt that he has spent half his waking hours studying the 
opposition for tendencies, patterns, a clue, a weakness -- any hint of 
vulnerability, no matter how small. By NFL standards he is a master at it; it 
has enabled him to survive for eight years in a league in which the average 
career lasts only 3.6 years. When coaches speak of him, they inevitably refer 
to his "astuteness for the game." 
</P>
<P>
"He played smart football instead of just brute-force football," says Norb 
Hecker, Milt's linebacker coach at Stanford and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In the judgment of new 49ers head coach George Seifert, the Niners' defensive 
coordinator while Milt was with the club, "His understanding of defenses was 
second to none, as far as the players I've worked with." 
</P>
<P>
Off McColl's left shoulder, squinting at the X-rays with furrowed brow, is the 
solicitous husband of the woman McColl is treating, a swarthy fellow wearing, 
wouldn't you know, an L.A. Raiders jacket. But he hasn't the faintest idea his 
wife is being treated by a Raiders linebacker. Given the zeal of the typical 
NFL fan, if he knew, he might well be more interested in the doctor than the 
diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
Such adulation may be a thing of the past for Milt McColl. After starting at 
outside linebacker almost every game for the 49ers in 1986 and 1987, he was 
traded to the Raiders, who used him primarily as a backup last season. During 
the off-season, the Raiders fortified their linebacking corps, and in March 
they told McColl they won't be needing his services this season. 
</P>
<P>
With residency beckoning and a life of medicine to follow, Milt is infinitely 
better positioned for this disappointing but inevitable juncture than are most 
NFL players, many of whom have made no preparations whatsoever for a 
post-football career. 
</P>
<P>
Milt has an edge over his peers in medicine as well. With an NFL salary that 
exceeded $200,000 the past few seasons and player shares from the 1981 and 1984 
Super Bowls totaling $100,000, he is on financial high ground utterly foreign 
to most doctors emerging from a costly medical education. The McColl family -- 
Milt and his wife, Cindy, and sons Connor, 20 months, and Kellen, 3 months -- 
recently moved into their new house, a modern, five-level foothill dwelling in 
Los Altos Hills with a commanding 270-degree view of the Coast Range and San 
Francisco Bay. Much of Milt's salary with the 49ers was deferred, so the 
McColls are in good shape even if Milt has played his last down. 
</P>
<P>
IT WAS AT precisely the same point in Bill McColl's life -- 29 years old, 
eight-year NFL veteran -- that his own football career ended. Halas and the 
Bears accommodated medical school, but ultimately medicine wouldn't accommodate 
the Bears: The orthopedics faculty at the University of Illinois hospitals 
voted 11 to 10 to ask Bill to quit the Bears and focus exclusively on his 
residency. Presumably, the majority 11 weren't Bears fans. 
</P>
<P>
McColl honored the vote without complaint, but he wishes he had it to do over. 
"Today I would have asked to overrule the vote," he says. "I wanted to play 
another season." 
</P>
<P>
Milt would like to play another season as well, one more shared thread in lives 
cut from the same cloth. "It's hard to ignore the fact that you can only play 
football for so long," he says, "but you can be a doctor for the rest of your 
life." Keep your options open, his father used to say. That maxim is now as 
integral to Milt's philosophy as it is to Bill's. And as the years unfold, 
Milt's example may well endow his own children with the same hopeful outlook, 
the same expansive sense of opportunity. Would he want to see his sons emulate 
him as closely as he emulated his father, extend the McColl tradition of MDs 
playing in the NFL? "I feel the same way my father did," Milt says. "If that's 
what they want to do, I certainly will support them, but it's up to them. All I 
can do is give them the pros and cons of what I've been through." In that, as 
so much else, he is his father's son. 
</P>
<P>
Milt may have acquired the best qualities of each of his parents -- or so Bill 
McColl was musing not long ago. By Bill's reckoning, Milt owes, at the very 
least, his grace, tact, considerate nature and sociability to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with that pronouncement, Bill falls silent and so must be prompted: 
What does Milt owe to his father? 
</P>
<P>
His face clenches in concentration as though he is hard-pressed to think of 
even one of Milt's virtues for which he could possibly take credit. 
Unacknowledged, perhaps because it is too obvious, or maybe for modesty's sake, 
is Milt's athletic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Bill McColl's face brightens. "My size," he says with a great, 
unbridled laugh. "Milt's got my size."

WHY AREN'T THE ARABS MORE LIKE US?; 
</P>
<P>
THE CLOSED CIRCLE AN INTERPRETATION OF THE ARABS BY DAVID PRYCE-JONES (AN 
EDWARD BURLINGAME BOOK / HARPER &amp; ROW: $25; 464 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Kelley, Kelley writes frequently on the Near East. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Burton (the adventurer and orientalist, not the actor) once pithily 
defined the nature of government in the Middle East as "despotism tempered by 
assassination." To judge from David Pryce-Jones' absorbing new study of Arab 
society and politics, things have not changed much -- unless for the worse -- 
since Burton's day. 
</P>
<P>
Pryce-Jones first came into contact with the Arab world as a child in 1941, 
when he was evacuated from Vichy France to Morocco in the care of an uncle, a 
Spanish diplomat. His next encounter was 15 years later, as a young officer in 
the British army at the time of the Suez expedition. It was not until 1967, 
however, when he covered the Arab-Israeli war as a correspondent, that he began 
to reflect upon the irrationalities and contradictions of Arab behavior which, 
among other things, had subjected them to ignominious defeat in that war. At 
intervals over the next 20 years, by means of wide reading and extensive travel 
in Arab lands, he made a valiant effort to penetrate the labyrinth of the Arab 
psyche, to discover, if he could, the subterranean springs of those 
self-destructive urges exhibited by so many Arabs so much of the time, to the 
bafflement and dismay of Western onlookers. Along the way, he published a most 
perceptive study of the Palestine Liberation Organization, "The Face of 
Defeat," which was noteworthy for its exposure of the way in which the rank and 
file who carry out the organization's dirty work are cynically manipulated by 
their leaders, secure in far-off, comfortable havens. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental question to which Pryce-Jones addresses himself in "The Closed 
Circle" is why it is that constitutional government, as understood in the West, 
has never evolved in the Arab world. Why is it that representative and 
parliamentary institutions, protection under the law, individual rights and 
guarantees, have failed to take root in Arab soil even though their seeds were 
planted and replanted in several Arab countries by Britain and France after 
both World Wars I and II? Instead, the Arabs of late years have resorted more 
and more to their basic social and religious institutions, the tribe and Islam, 
to provide the structure of government. Any progress toward political maturity 
has been stultified by their inability to comprehend any loyalty other than 
that to family, tribe or religious sect. Loyalty to the state, to the nation or 
to the constitution is a concept devoid of meaning for them. In its place there 
is only the tradition of obedience to the ruler; in other words, Oriental 
despotism. 
</P>
<P>
The state and its treasury are only there to be seized and plundered for the 
enrichment of family, tribe or faction. (Consider, for example, the regimes 
currently in power in Libya, Syria and Iraq.) Inevitably, of course, the wealth 
and power of a ruler or ruling clique excite the envy of other ambitious 
spirits, provoking them to challenge the existing regime. Because no 
sophisticated political machinery exists for the expression of that challenge, 
it will, like tribal or family feuds, be resolved by violence. Arab custom and 
tradition offer no alternatives. And the successful challenger, with equal 
inevitability, will resort to the repressive methods of his predecessor to 
retain his new-found power. So the cycle of violence becomes perpetual. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any hope that the Arabs will ever break out of the closed circle of 
repression and violence into which they have locked themselves? Pryce-Jones 
doubts it, if only because they are bedeviled by their obsession with "face," 
or what he describes as "the shame/honor concept." The trouble about the 
question of face is that it is, to a very great extent, only skin-deep, i.e. it 
depends upon shallow and superficial considerations. Honor is not just a matter 
of manliness, family, tribal code, religious faith, etc. but also of 
ostentation, magniloquence and bravado. Shame, for its part, resides not only 
in the betrayal of duty or code or family but also in occupying a lowly station 
in society, in being poor, or being employed in a menial occupation. In 
contrast to the prevailing attitude in Western society, shame for an Arab does 
not derive so much from the commission of misdeeds (what is a misdeed to a 
European or an American is not necessarily one to an Arab) as from being bested 
by another. Thus there is no shame in engaging in what Westerners would regard 
as lying or cheating, especially in commercial transactions; for the exclusive 
aim is to come out on top, regardless of the methods used. It is an attitude 
that has caused much misunderstanding and ill-feeling between Arabs and 
Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
The operation of the principle may again be seen in the use of family 
connections to attain wealth or high office. Whereas in the West a man who 
gained high office solely by virtue of his family connections would attract a 
certain degree of contempt, in Arab eyes, a man who did not use his family's 
position to enrich himself or advance himself to high office would be an object 
of scorn and shame. 
</P>
<P>
Hand in hand with the question of face goes the abuse of public office for 
personal gain, or, as Pryce-Jones has it, "the money-favor nexus." Baksheesh 
(bribery or handouts) is so integral a component of Arab life that its 
deleterious consequences are rarely questioned. To further oneself, or even to 
survive, in the immense pyramid of Arab society it is necessary to placate 
those above with money, deference, humility. Conversely, those above consider 
themselves entitled to demand of those below abject subservience, sweetened by 
appropriate offerings of baksheesh. It is a system that degrades all. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the psychological burden carried by the Arabs originates in their 
confused attitude, compounded equally of envy and resentment, toward the 
Western world. Modern Arabic literature, he points out, is permeated by both 
self-hatred and hatred of the West and all its works. But much of the 
nihilistic vaporing of Arab intellectuals, as he also makes clear, is copycat 
stuff, picked up during a sojourn in Europe or America. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab peoples deserve something better than this from their soi-disant 
intelligentsia. They also deserve, as Pryce-Jones observes toward the end of 
his brave, honest and thoughtful book, a better system of government than they 
have had to date, or at least a better class of ruler. 
</P>
<P>
The omens, one regrets to say, are not propitious.

If writing can be described as exercise, then fiction and nonfiction use two 
different sets of muscles. And while Peter Maas, author of "Serpico," "The 
Valachi Papers" and "King of the Gypsies," clearly has the conditioning to 
succeed in nonfiction, novels are something else again. "Father and Son" is 
Maas' eighth book, but only his second work of fiction, and while it is far 
from flabby, no one but his agent (to whom the book is dedicated) would 
characterize it as being in terrific shape either. 
</P>
<P>
"Father and Son" is a novel that in simpler times would have been described as 
having been "ripped from today's headlines." It opens with an expertly planned 
break-in at a National Guard Armory in the Boston area and the subsequent 
pilfering of M16 rifles, grenade launchers, heavy machine guns and the like. 
The grateful recipient of this largess is to be the Irish Republican Army, 
which plans to use it to further its perennial struggle to free Northern 
Ireland from British control. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the weapons is one thing, getting them to Ireland something else again. 
Here the IRA relies on what Maas portrays as a fairly extensive network of 
American supporters, both inside the federal government and out. One of them 
turns out to be a 19-year-old Harvard student and ace sailor named Jamie 
McGuire who, having been fed tales of Irish resistance by his grandfather, is 
recruited by an IRA lad who hears him sing teary songs of the rebellion like 
"Back Home in Derry" and "Kevin Barry" at a Cambridge pub. 
</P>
<P>
Well, before the IRA makes contact with Jamie, however, a good 10 years earlier 
in fact, we meet him and his father, Michael McGuire, a New York advertising 
man with little or no feeling for his Irish heritage. What Michael did care 
about was his wife, Mary Alice, and a good part of this book is taken up with 
her unexpected death when Jamie was 9. We get to see how both father and son 
coped with the loss and how their relationship leads both to Jamie's 
involvement with the IRA and his father's attempt to insure that that 
attraction not be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
As you would expect from a nonfiction writer of his caliber, Maas handles that 
initial armory break-in scene quite nicely. In fact, all the situations 
involving the logistics of IRA covert actions both in this country and on the 
Emerald Isle, as well as the machinations of the British counterintelligence 
operatives, are brisk and involving. 
</P>
<P>
Maas has clearly done quite a bit of research in this area, and it pays off not 
only in enticing tidbits like how IRA operatives are snuck past U.S. Customs 
and exactly the way razor wire is used to protect British installations in 
Belfast, but in a general air of authenticity that makes the plot of "Father 
and Son" that much more believable. 
</P>
<P>
Maas is also good at capturing the determination and resilient spirit of the 
IRA, the timeless feeling that, as one of its leaders says, whatever he 
accomplishes in getting the British out is "but a tick of the clock that's been 
runnin' over eight hundred years." Maas manages to sympathize with the lads 
without fawning over them, and though that may keep the book off of Margaret 
Thatcher's bedside table, it is a virtue nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
But at home as he is in the tension and logistics of secret missions, that's 
how off base Maas is in the delineation and development of character. It's not 
just that his Britishers literally say things like "Chin up, old chap" and 
"Cheerio," or that his IRA leaders are all noble and laconic: In the context of 
a straight thriller, those lapses are acceptable, even to be expected. However, 
Maas is attempting something different with "Father and Son" and that simply 
does not come off. 
</P>
<P>
What Maas is trying to do with Jamie and Michael McGuire is create realistic, 
believable human beings, not only because the more we care about them the more 
effective the jeopardy he puts them in will be but also because he knows that 
character is the key fiction muscle that needs to be developed if a novel is to 
rise above the level of the potboiler. 
</P>
<P>
So we are forced to wade through what feels like endless scenes of father and 
son, often fishing but always exchanging tiresome bromides about life. Though 
he is deft when it comes to action, Maas has a hollow tin ear when it comes to 
dialogue, and emotionally bankrupt lines like Michael's thought that "If a bad 
thing happened to Jamie, he didn't think he could go on" lie listlessly on the 
page like so many dead flounder. 
</P>
<P>
Not only doesn't this attempted humanizing of Michael and Jamie add to the 
book's considerable suspense, it almost diminishes it, because every time Maas 
cuts away from action to character you want to get up and have a beer. The idea 
of trying to escape from the cliches of genre is a good one, but Maas' 
insufficient efforts have ended up only underlining them.

THE LIMITS OF MORAL LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his review of "The Crosswinds of Freedom" by James MacGregor Burns (Book 
Review, April 16), Larry Ceplair says that Burns cited the American Bishops' 
1983 and '84 Pastoral Letters as isolated examples of exemplary moral 
leadership in a society in dire need of the same. Ceplair then notes that "the 
bishops, as a body, have been silent on the Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence 
on Salman Rushdie." Is Ceplair implying that the bishops somehow approve of 
Khomeini's threats? As far as I know, the bishops have yet to take a stand on, 
among other things, the Valdez oil spill, Baby Jessica or the accidental 
entrapment of whales in the Arctic ice pack. Are we to conclude by this logic 
that the bishops are unconcerned about the environment or, worse yet, don't 
like little children or whales?

WOMANNING THE BATTLEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jacob Epstein's review of Ishmael Reed's "The Terrible Threes" (Book Review, 
June 4) begins with the statement that since the early 1970s, "American writers 
have all but abandoned the field of social criticism . . . (although a) few 
writers still man the battlements of satire." To exemplify his main point, he 
cites the lack of social criticism in the more recent works of Vidal, Roth, 
Updike, Bellow and Mailer. The exclusion of prominent American women writers 
from this list suggests that his use of the terms "man" is not merely 
parenthetical. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, to consider the recent work of American women writers would 
undermine his point, since Alice Walker, Gloria Naylor and Toni Morrison (to 
name a few examples) have all devoted themselves to works of social criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is Epstein's prerogative to limit his survey to the works of 
prominent American male writers, to leave that gender distinction 
unacknowledged does a disservice to the works of prominent American women 
writers, who clearly cannot be included in his account of the new, apolitical 
literary fashion.

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How am I, a single soul, supposed to respond to Kirkpatrick Sale's call for 
action against the slow slide into ecological holocaust? Every time I turn the 
key in my 1980 diesel car to drive to the store, I contribute more poison to 
the nightmare. The electricity I burn every hour of every day drains a power 
source which must be replaced through burning coal, oil or nuclear energy. My 
refrigerator hums in the kitchen, I write by this light over my head, the clock 
ticks on the mantle, the air conditioner whirs in the attic. If I cut my lawn, 
prune my trees or turn on the garden fountain, more energy is expended. 
</P>
<P>
So I then, the one served by all these machines, must in a very real sense be a 
"root cause." Shall I walk to the store, turn off the electricity, scratch out 
this message with a pen? I could do so, for I recall a time spent living on a 
farm where 95% of our livelihood came from the land. But the subsistence farm 
has been dead for 50 years at least, gobbled up by corporate farms and 
converted to single crops. 
</P>
<P>
How do I begin? How do we begin to reverse the nightmare slide? We each must be 
more discriminating in meeting our needs, saying "no" to the quick buck, the 
short cuts, the baubles. If the broom will sweep a walk, why buy a blower? Save 
the energy. If a small car will give 27 miles per gallon, why buy a gas 
guzzler? If our job's final result is to further the wastefulness of our 
culture, why stay? In short, we must begin individually to reshape the very 
elemental factors of modern industrial life while we still have time. 
Otherwise, we are the eco-crisis!

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reviewing James Bellini's "High Tech Holocaust" (Book Review, April 16) 
Kirkpatrick Sale displays an astonishing naivete about primitive societies. His 
bizarre claim that the "healthy cultures of the past (including those first on 
this continent) . . . sought harmony with, not dominance over, the precious 
systems of the living Earth" left me quite amazed. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale species slaughter often has followed first colonizations by primitive 
man. Where today are the aurochs of Europe, or the elephants and hippos of the 
Mediterranean? What happened to the moas of New Zealand? Hunter-gatherers 
butchering their way through the cornucopia erased them all, leaving for us 
only clutters of bone among their trash heaps. However romantic these peoples 
may seem, they had little use for the concept of environmental responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Sale tries to scold us into drawing upon the wisdoms of primitive societies for 
answers to the sad shape of the Earth. In fact, no course could be sillier. 
Twentieth-Century Western culture, which has heaped the planet with 
unprecedented waste, also has given rise to our only hope of salvation: the 
environmental movement. No twisting of the evidence or glossy arguments about 
the nobility of savages can alter the fact that primitive man was even more 
capable of soiling his bed than his descendants. 
</P>
<P>
The solutions to the "eco-catastrophe" lie among the very tools that created 
it; namely, information and technology. To ignore this is to sell grievously 
short the conscientious army that battles diligently for a cleaner Earth, and 
to discourage any of us from harboring any hope of their success.

LA BOYLE; 
</P>
<P>
FOR L.A.'S MARIACHIS, THE ROAD TO SUCCESS BEGINS OUTSIDE A DOUGHNUT SHOP AT 
FIRST AND BOYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REX WEINER, Rex Weiner is a writer based in Los Angeles and Seattle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A SHORT STROLL FROM downtown Los Angeles, across the First Street Bridge, the 
junction of Boyle Avenue and First Street forms a little plaza framed by a 
doughnut shop and a Marlboro man riding atop his billboard horse. On any given 
night, as day fades behind L.A.'s mirrored skyline, scores of mariachis gather 
here, carrying guitars, accordions, violins, trumpets, big bass guitarrons. 
They come to join their bands, look for jobs, exchange gossip and perhaps find 
a way out of obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, the plaza, known among the musicians as La Boyle (la 
boy-lay), has been a gathering place for mariachi bands -- from strolling 
street bands that sing to survive to musicians who no longer need to hustle for 
work but want to stay in touch with the community. They all know the plaza, and 
whenever a good player shows up there, the word gets around. In the past 
decade, Los Angeles has become the new mariachi mecca, and La Boyle is its 
center. It is unique north of the Mexican border, because each nearby house, 
apartment and hotel -- in fact, the whole neighborhood -- is inhabited mainly 
by mariachis. 
</P>
<P>
A new Cadillac pulls up to the curb, and the driver rolls down the window to 
talk to a handful of musicians. He is a Latino businessman looking to hire a 
mariachi band for his wife's birthday party tonight at their Beverly Hills 
home. The jefe (leader) of a group is right there to grab the job. The price is 
set -- for a good four-piece band, the rate is $175 an hour, with a two-hour 
minimum. A down-payment made, the deal is sealed on a handshake. The musicians 
pile into a beat-up van owned by one of them and rumble off. 
</P>
<P>
The less-established musicians, unattached to any particular group, wait as 
station wagons and bright step-vans come and go -- the bands loading up their 
instruments, squeezing in for trips to Pacoima, Azusa or Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The older mariachis sit on a row of boxes against the side of the doughnut 
shop, holding banged-up guitars and dented trumpets. Occasionally, someone will 
strum a tune -- or go inside for coffee and doughnuts or a game of cards. 
</P>
<P>
It's a cohesive community. Most of the La Boyle musicians have been in the 
United States -- not all legally -- between 10 and 15 years. The band members 
are often interchangeable, and they try to help one another out, even taking up 
collections for musicians who are ill or in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the players now hold steady jobs with groups that perform regularly; 
others supplement low-wage day jobs by playing at night. And among them are a 
few dedicated young musicians, recently arrived with dreams of success. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two places for a mariachi to become famous," says a 19-year-old 
guitarist named Leandro, "Mexico City and L.A. I hope to make it here." 
</P>
<P>
Leandro has just arrived from Guadalajara, where he comes from a long line of 
musicians (the mariachi tradition tends to run in families). Leandro had played 
with a group in Mexico for four years, and when he heard about La Boyle, he 
came to try his luck. He sleeps days on his cousin's couch in a nearby 
apartment, and at night he goes to the plaza. He dresses in his traje de charro 
(suit of the horseman), the traditional black mariachi costume with silver 
trim, standing straight and tall to catch the eye of any jefe who might need a 
guitar player for his group. Last night, he teamed up with two other musicians, 
walking from bar to bar, playing for about $5 a song. His share at dawn was 
$35. 
</P>
<P>
Leandro hopes to form his own group here and make a name for himself. But 
first, he must pay off the coyote who got him across the border and buy himself 
some ID. 
</P>
<P>
"I REMEMBER,"says one tall, lean mariachi who everyone calls El Cochero (the 
Coachman) after a legendary movie character. "I remember when this doughnut 
shop used to be a gas station. And the trolley cars stopped at this spot when I 
first came 31 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone nods. El Cochero is a fundador, a founder of La Boyle, and the others 
regard him with awe. Leaning against the doughnut shop wall, he tells the story 
of his father from Sinaloa who married a beautiful Puerto Rican woman, of how 
he himself was born in Mexicali and moved to the United States as a teen-ager. 
He joined the Navy during the Korean War and became a citizen in 1956. But 
always he played the music his father had taught him. 
</P>
<P>
When he quit the sea and came to settle in Los Angeles, he found a $7-a-week 
room in a Boyle Heights house. (El Palacio del Cochero, they still call it.) He 
began playing the music he loves, going from bar to restaurant, assembling 
groups, quitting, forming new ones, always writing new songs, becoming 
legendary among the La Boyle musicians. Now in his 60s, El Cochero still plays 
at restaurants such as El Palenque in Azusa, approaching tables to ask diners 
whether there is something they'd like to hear, collecting $6 a song. 
</P>
<P>
ACROSS THE STREET from the doughnut shop, music blares from the Casa del 
Mariachi. The front and sides of this bar are painted with murals by local 
artists, scenes of mariachis, the Virgin of Guadalupe and East L.A. barrio 
life. Indoors, the jukebox pours out a poignant song by the late mariachi hero 
Jose Alfredo Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez stretched mariachi music beyond its traditional boundaries in the 1950s 
by writing songs in the ranchera (country) style and performing them with 
mariachi instruments. This popular singer-songwriter popularized mariachi music 
with hit songs such as "A Punto de Llorar" ("On the Verge of Tears") and "Amor 
del Alma" ("Love of My Soul"). These compositions, about love, life and broken 
hearts have become mariachi standards. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional mariachi music originated in Cocula, in the region southwest of 
Guadalajara, when the French took over Mexico from Spain in the 1860s. During 
the brief reign of Maximilian, European instrumentation was adapted to existing 
folk melodies and Indian rhythms to create music that was performed at wedding 
celebrations. Mariage in French became mariachi in Spanish. Or at least that's 
one story. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional mariachi groups have eight to 12 pieces, and at the heart of the 
music they play is a collection of songs called sones, about 50 compositions 
with brassy, rhythmic instrumental arrangements and simple, sentimental lyrics 
that often contain bawdy or political double meanings. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the mariachi repertoire has widened to accommodate not only the 
country-and-Western style of Jose Alfredo Jimenez but also Latin styles from 
all over. A good mariachi must know a minimum of 200 songs; the best boast of 
being able to play 500. 
</P>
<P>
But making it in L.A. requires more, says Ricardo Cisneros, who plays with the 
band Los Galleros at El Rey restaurant in Montebello. "Today you must know how 
to read music, how to follow arrangements." The few who succeed here could wind 
up in bands with regular jobs or, eventually, buy their own restaurants. One 
such restaurant is La Fonda on Wilshire Boulevard, whose owner, Nati Cano, and 
his band, Los Camperos, backed Linda Ronstadt's performance at this year's 
Grammy Awards. Most, like El Cochero, will continue to pursue their art in the 
streets. The street is where the music has heart. 
</P>
<P>
OVER AT LA BOYLE, it is late, and most of the groups have gone off to their 
jobs. A few men still sit on boxes, backs propped against the wall of the 
doughnut shop, which will soon close. 
</P>
<P>
Leandro stands nearby, listening to the older mariachis tell their stories. El 
Cochero has a half-pint of whiskey and is telling about his son, who lives in 
San Jose and plays trumpet in a mariachi group, carrying on the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Leandro's posture is wilted by having waited all night with no luck. He leans 
now against a car and looks tired, but he persists. "Without the music," he 
says, "I could not live." 
</P>
<P>
Just then, a car full of mariachis pulls up. They need another guitar player 
for a private party. Leandro climbs in and they take off, leaving only El 
Cochero to talk in the glow of the street lamp about a song he wrote for a 
Cuban girl he met years ago in Salinas. El Cochero holds his guitar close to 
his chest, closes his eyes and sings the song.

GARDENS: VILLA NARCISSA; 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAN FOR THIS ITALIAN RENAISSANCE GARDEN WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD -- IT WAS TO 
BE APPROPRIATE TO ITS MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Magazine.

<P>
WHEN THE SUN comes up on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the sea sparkles and the 
early morning light sweeps across the Villa Narcissa, setting its bright paint 
on fire and illumining the garden with a golden glow. On days such as this, the 
sky is an intense blue, the ocean is aquamarine, and you can hear the crash of 
surf and the sharp cries of peacocks echoing in the canyon. In Southern 
California, there is no other place quite like it. 
</P>
<P>
That remarkable light, seen only in Mediterranean climates, rich and intense 
with razor-sharp shadows -- a painter's light -- is not easy to work with. 
Perhaps, then, it is not surprising that the Villa Narcissa is home for Elin 
Vanderlip, who, as founder and guiding light of Friends of French Art, devotes 
herself to the preservation of art. 
</P>
<P>
The Villa Narcissa was built in 1924 by the late Frank A. Vanderlip, who had 
purchased the 16,000 or so acres of the original Spanish Land Grant of Rancho 
Palos Verdes. Vanderlip spent several years deciding on a suitable site for his 
villa, even employing a meteorologist to make sure it would be above the low 
coastal fog. Vanderlip settled on this site -- below the ridge of the mountains 
but high above the sea -- with a view down the canyon to the breaking surf at 
Portuguese Bend. First he built a rustic ranch house and then a guest house, 
the present villa. The Depression interceded; the main house was never built. 
But Vanderlip did not seem all that interested in houses anyway, preferring to 
spend his time on the gardens and on a collection of exotic birds that, save 
for a noisy band of peacocks, later would be moved to the Wrigley property on 
Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
America's premier landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, laid out the 
original garden while he was working on the planning of the City of Palos 
Verdes Estates. Olmsted's design was Mediterranean in style, with a cypress 
allee up the hill, pepper- and olive-lined drives, an orangerie and a kitchen 
garden. The plan was straightforward -- the garden was to be appropriate to its 
climate. There was no attempt to duplicate the shaded Vanderlip estate in New 
York or the green gardens of England, though the villas and gardens of Tuscany 
were given more than a sideways glance. 
</P>
<P>
The original garden, however, is mostly gone, a victim of "devastating brush 
fires and acquisitions by owners with less interest in the land," as Elin 
Vanderlip discreetly puts it. Several old cypresses and a few pines remain, but 
most of what you now see is the restorative work of Elin Vanderlip, who has 
been careful not to over-restore the surroundings. The many shades of paint on 
the house, the chips and cracks of time; the old, gnarled trunks of the 
original trees: All of those could be easily patched or replaced but are 
purposefully left the way they are to add texture to the present. 
</P>
<P>
The approach to the villa is still under renovation, awaiting the necessary 
funds. There are several hundred trees to replant and about a mile of drive to 
pave. Above the house, a dramatic driveway leads to one of the outbuildings and 
appears as it should -- rough gravel serving as paving, hand-laid stone and 
stucco walls to either side, a pine with its trunk painted a very visible 
white. Pride of Madeira, geraniums and trailing African daisies grow here with 
little more than rain to sustain them. 
</P>
<P>
It is also here that you notice that certain plants -- Italian cypress, stone 
and Aleppo pines, geraniums and African daisies, tall bearded iris and citrus, 
and our own native grasses and chaparral -- look strong and clear in the 
Mediterranean light, their grayed colors readily taking on the glow of sunrise 
and sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Rustic steps of broken roof tile ensure a secure footing for the trek down the 
hill and employ the color of the house -- thus the parts become a harmonious 
whole, framed by the twin rows of cypresses. Most of the cypresses are still 
young, though here and there are survivors from the previous garden, now 
massive and heavy with several trunks. 
</P>
<P>
Partway down the hill, you pass through the orangerie and kitchen garden, 
enclosed by a fence that keeps out the peacocks. Behind a gate painted a bright 
Provence blue is a tunnel of deciduous fruit trees espaliered on hoops over the 
central walk. Beds of artichokes, herbs and kitchen vegetables are on either 
side; behind them are rows of bearded iris for cutting. 
</P>
<P>
A fountain lies at the foot of the main allee, signaling a change of venue -- 
you are about to enter the irrigated section of the garden with its clipped 
formality and lusher, brighter greens. After a few more steps, you are at the 
entry, where walkways at either side lead to other gardens. As in all classic 
Italian Renaissance gardens (and most gardens built prior to the 19th Century), 
not everything is revealed at once -- there is not one big garden, but many 
smaller gardens, each with its own surprises. 
</P>
<P>
There is another kind of light on the peninsula -- the hazy, gray light of an 
overcast day, and parts of the garden seem planned for that inevitable event. 
One area is just to the right of the entrance court, where most of the flowers 
are grown, including those for the house. Here is the only patch of true lawn, 
surrounded by borders filled with delphiniums and other stately flowers that 
look best not in the clear, clean light of a high, hot sun, but in the cool 
light that penetrates the thin cloud cover of an overcast day. 
</P>
<P>
To the left of the front door is a formal walk, the true entry to the garden 
and house. And to one side of that, a remarkable little garden where moss and 
sweet alyssum make a meadow surrounded by shady beds. 
</P>
<P>
Continue on and you are on the back terrace, which sits atop a retaining wall 
and offers a view of the entire canyon and the sea beyond where Catalina 
floats, firmly anchored, on a hazy horizon. 
</P>
<P>
This terrace faces due south. At one end is a formal rose garden and fountain 
and at the other a short allee of young olive trees that shade tables of 
Vincenza stone. This terrace is modeled after one seen by Elin Vanderlip at the 
Villa Albobrandini, Frascati -- the Hortensia terrace -- a reference to the 
large pots of garden hydrangeas that line its edges (at one time, this common 
hydrangea was named Hydrangea hortensia; now H. macrophylla). The olives 
overhead, only 5 years old, provide just enough filtered light for the 
hydrangeas, which show their delight by blooming most of summer. (The 
photographs of the alyssum meadow and the Hortensia terrace were taken in 
summer -- the other photographs show the garden in spring -- and are from the 
book "Intimate Gardens," by Susan Ashbrook, to be published sometime next 
year.) 
</P>
<P>
No tour of the Villa Narcissa is complete until Vanderlip takes you in her 
four-wheel-drive truck across the canyon to a grove of pines planted by her 
mother. From there, you can see the entire property, and the tidal wave of new 
homes cresting the hill behind. Those houses -- with a more panoramic view, but 
on the windier ridge above -- seem confused as to their whereabouts, sporting 
colors that do not complement the soil or surroundings, and planted with 
vegetation that would certainly be happier in a wetter, less windy climate. In 
contrast, the Villa Narcissa, painted a deeper shade than the soil it rests on, 
looks completely at home -- dry native grasses and olive-green chaparral slowly 
giving way to the brighter grays of century plants and olives and the dark 
green of the cypress sentinels. 
</P>

<GRAPHIC>
<P>
Photo, COLOR, In 1924, above the fog on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, Frank 
Vanderlip built a villa with a view to the sea. Seen from across the canyon 
(top), the olive green of the chaparral changes to the gray of agaves and 
olives at the outer edge of the garden. The drive at the top of the hill 
(above) leads to a long path and allee of cypress that drops down to the 
earth-colored house, today called the Villa Narcissa (opposite). ; Photo, 
COLOR, Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted patterned the formal garden by 
the front door after an "Italian farmstead courtyard." ; Photo, COLOR, The path 
down the hill is lined with recycled roof tiles (left). Around back is the 
Hortensia terrace, named for the Hortensia hydrangea that line its edges 
(above). Irish moss and sweet alyssum make a meadow in a corner of the garden.

<P>
SUN-CARE PRODUCTS INDULGE FANS OF THE TAN BUT AIM TO LIMIT RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PADDY CALISTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
POSITIVE THINKERS say that America's passion for the suntan is fading. Yet last 
year, sales of sun-care products were at a record $500 million, with most of 
the dollars going to preparations that allow for a suntan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the National Institutes of Health's adamant "no tan is a safe tan" 
message, millions of Americans are still convinced that bronzed is beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Since most sunscreens only filter out the sunburn-producing ultraviolet-B rays, 
it is still possible to get a suntan via ultraviolet-A, infrared and other rays 
generated by the sun. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to dermatologist Madhu Pathak, chairman of the Skin Cancer 
Foundation's photobiology committee, "Fair-skinned people cannot stimulate a 
tan without damaging their skin cells first." A recent nationwide survey of 
more than 1,000 people by the American Academy of Dermatology and the Avon 
Foundation, however, found that half of the respondents make an effort to tan 
and think it looks healthy. Another Academy study of 500 women found that 68% 
think they are more attractive tanned. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers are responding with more types of tanning products and, for the 
cautious, more ways to limit exposure or fake the baked look. 
</P>
<P>
NIH skin specialists say that people who live in sunny climates should use a 
product with a sun protection factor of at least 15. "The biggest growth area 
is in SPF 15 and above," says Susan Babinsky, consumer-products specialist for 
Kline &amp; Co., an international consulting firm. At Coppertone, America's 
largest sun-care firm, the best-selling new product is an SPF 44. 
</P>
<P>
But as manufacturers point out, most sales continue to be in lower SPF numbers. 
Coppertone's hottest seller overall, for example, is an SPF-4 lotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though SPF-24 sales were strong last year, our best sellers were SPF 10 
and 6, and we forecast the same for this season," says Jacqueline Cohen, 
spokesperson for Giorgio Beverly Hills Tan products. 
</P>
<P>
Sequi Inc.'s Rescue, a mass-market sunscreen that also wards off insects, is 
available in SPF 4 because "so many people want protection but still want to 
tan," says Steve Schulze, president of the Newport Beach firm. 
</P>
<P>
For sun worshipers, new Sun Spots from Delaware-based Sun du jour and Solasis 
UV Sunsensors by Manhattan's Sola Research Labs Inc., monitor exposure to rays. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny adhesive patches work like little alarm clocks, turning red when it's 
time to apply more sunscreen. Sun du jour President Doug Fariss says the skin 
patches, which absorb ultraviolet rays, change color before the wearer's skin 
has received enough radiation to develop a sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
Other consumers are compromising: They will stay out of the sun, but they will 
manage to keep up a bronze appearance by using either a "self-tanning" product, 
such as Lauder's Self-Action Tanning Creme, or a makeup designed to impart a 
sunny glow, such as Giorgio's Extraordinary Bronzing Powder. As I. Magnin 
cosmetics buyer Gary Cockrell puts it: "There are two consumers out there: the 
ones who must tan and the ones who won't. We have to sell something for both."

WINE: A GREAT WHITE; 
</P>
<P>
THE ROBERT PEPI WINERY TAMES THE SAVAGE SAUVIGNON BLANC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LAWRENCE BALZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT HAS NEVER been easy to produce fine Sauvignon Blanc, because the grape 
involved commonly imparts to the wine "savage" taste elements -- from a mild 
grassiness to the flavor of asparagus juice. Thus, it is rare that a winery 
specializes in Sauvignon Blanc. But the Robert Pepi Winery in Napa Valley does 
so -- with exceptionally good results. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five percent of the winery's total production is devoted to white wines, 
primarily Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon, and Pepi considers the Sauvignon Blanc 
to be its flagship. The walls are covered with medals attesting to Pepi's 
success, beginning with its first vintage in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Wine makers everywhere wrestle with taming the worrisome taste overtones of 
Sauvignon Blanc. I know of whole vineyards that have been T-bud grafted, 
whereby the top of the Sauvignon Blanc vines are cut off and replacement buds 
of another varietal are grafted in their place. 
</P>
<P>
In my columns, I have mentioned new techniques such as leaf pulling and vine 
training to bring more air and sunlight to the grape clusters and eliminate the 
grassiness. These methods result in a wonderful melon, peach, fig or even 
ripe-lime fruitiness. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepi winery uses these techniques and more. Its Sauvignon Blanc is styled 
in the French tradition, in which Semillon is blended. 
</P>
<P>
The Sauvignon Blanc grapes are harvested at low sugar levels, which will give 
the wine a soft fruit quality. The wine then is blended with Semillon to give 
it texture and aging potential. The two varietals, which came to California in 
the 1880s from the famed Chateau d'Yquem vineyard in Bordeaux, are later 
married in 1,600-gallon French oak upright tanks to develop complexity. The 
vessels, much larger than the standard 50-gallon barrels, minimize the oak 
tastes that the wine would pick up in smaller barrels because less wine is 
exposed to the oak in the tanks. The wine emerges with an almost floral 
bouquet, light herbal tastes and a lush, savory roundness. It's a winner every 
vintage. Trying the 1987 Robert Pepi Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($8.50) 
confirms this. Composed of 80% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Semillon, the wine has a 
dry finish. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepi family began growing grapes and making wine in the northern Italian 
region of Tuscany and the small town of Lucca, from which Robert A. Pepi's 
parents emigrated in the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing the family tradition, Robert and Aurora Pepi bought a 70-acre 
vineyard near Oakville in 1966. Studies indicated that Sauvignon Blanc and 
Semillon grapes were especially well-suited to that site. The Pepi family grew 
grapes exclusively until 1979, when Robert's son, Robert L. Pepi, and the 
family decided that they could afford to build a winery. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Pepi, as wine maker, is also quite proud of his Cabernet Sauvignon, 
a 100% varietal produced from grapes grown at the Vine Hill Ranch, adjacent to 
Napa's Martha's Vineyard. Drinkable while still young -- the 1984 vintage 
($16), for example, has intense cedar, juniper and blackberry flavors -- it 
ages to a softer, more mellow claret finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Where you find the Robert Pepi Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon, you'll 
probably come upon the Chardonnay ($12) and Semillon ($8). The latter suggests 
the tastes of ripe peaches or melons. And the Chardonnay has apple and citrus 
flavors, with some buttery tastes from partial malolactic fermentation and 
brief time in fine French oak.

Regarding "The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate," by Stephen Farber (April 30): The

the version to be colorized. -- The Editors

Dan Sullivan is correct when he states that the Tony Award for best musical 
used to go to new shows like "West Side Story" and the best play award to shows 
like "A Streetcar Named Desire" ("The Tonys: An Honor in Decline," June 4). 
</P>
<P>
Lest anyone get the wrong impression, however, let it be known that "The Music 
Man" beat "West Side Story" for best musical in 1958 and "Mister Roberts" beat 
"Streetcar" for best play in 1948.

It was incredible to read in S. J. Diamond's May 26 column, "Teachers' Strike 
Left Consumers Feeling Helpless," that the chauffeur for the superintendent of 
schools makes $91,000 a year. Not bad, not bad at all when compared to the 
teacher's salary range of $23,000 to $43,000 quoted in the article. 
</P>
<P>
What a squandering of public money! There will surely come a day when the 
public will demand changes in the entire educational system, which is 
apparently top heavy with highly paid administrators.

Perhaps Armand Hammer is getting more respect than he deserves. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the May 28 letter from Melinda Stephens ("Oxy Art for 
Everyone"), who responded to your May 11 article on the use of Occidental 
Petroleum funds to glorify Hammer with a museum named after him, I think it is 
horrendous to use corporate capital in this way. 
</P>
<P>
I am particularly opposed to the plan because Armand Hammer has consistently 
paid millions for the works of dead artists while lacking the courage, 
conviction and compassion to invest similar sums of money into the creations of 
living artists. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer repeats the mistakes of those insensitive art lovers who allowed Van 
Gogh and others to live and die in the horrible pain of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer deserves respect as a businessman for his achievements. But it is a slap 
in the face of living and dead artists to permit his name to be respected in 
the art world, when he has demonstrated such insensitivity to the plight of 
living artists.

I came away from a recent excellent presentation of "Stand Up Tragedy" at the 
Mark Taper saddened by the complexity of problems in the inner city. But when I 
read "Should Defense Firms Switch From Swords to Plowshares?" (Viewpoints, June 
11), it gave me new hope. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of the ghetto, as large as they are, will take every resource we 
can afford over the next decade or two. Since 1945, we have spent trillions on 
defense -- enough money to rebuild every single city, road and railroad west of 
the Mississippi. We now need to redirect a portion of these resources and the 
tremendous brain power to more important issues. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to my neighbors in our ghettos does affect me. With the cold war 
behind us, it's time to put our tax dollars to use solving the survival issues 
of our society and our planet.

BUSH CLEARS AIR ON POLLUTION, BUT FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S MAINLY RHETORIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary D. Nichols, Mary D. Nichols is an environmental attorney in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Large chunks of the clean-air package President George Bush unveiled with great 
fanfare last week are relevant to California only for the rhetorical tone of 
the press release and White House fact sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Despite earlier rumors, the Bush Administration has endorsed the basic 
structure of the 1970 Clean Air Act, with its commitment to achieving 
health-based standards within enforceable deadlines and a strong federal 
program to push technological innovation as the means to limit pollution. 
Ambitious plans adopted earlier by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District and tougher automobile emission standards recently enacted for new 
California cars by the state Air Resources Board are clearly acknowledged and, 
in watered-down form, proposed for the rest of the country. California 
air-quality officials have naturally greeted the Bush proposals with relief and 
even some cautious enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush plan, although hard to evaluate because it lacks the specifics said to 
be in a coming message to Congress, will certainly allow state and local 
agencies to get on with the business of cleaning up industrial pollution -- 
including smaller and more exotic sources like spray deodorants and back-yard 
barbecues. But the major cause of urban smog is our transportation system -- 
cars, trucks, buses and the fuels they burn as we drive more of them each year 
over longer commuting distances. Taken together, vehicles cause more than 80% 
of Los Angeles smog. Unfortunately, there are some disturbing ideological 
signals in the President's strategy for cleaning up current mobile-source 
pollution, and a total lack of vision for the future growth and direction of 
our transportation-based economy. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan would move the new-car standard for hydrocarbons -- one of the two 
necessary ingredients for photochemical smog formation -- toward the California 
standard within some unstated period of time. Nitrogen oxides, the other smog 
culprit, and carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas, are left at their current 
levels. This reflects the common consensus among automotive engineers that 
little more can be done to improve the emissions of cars with conventional 
engines using current fuels and certification procedures. Instead, Bush 
proposes to mandate, on a phased schedule, the introduction of cars using 
"clean" fuels, such as methanol, ethanol or natural gas, beginning in 1995. 
This clean-fuels initiative, although limited to the nine regions with the 
worst automotive pollution problems in the country, is ambitious enough to 
fulfill a campaign pledge to Midwestern farmers to put "corn in every car." 
</P>
<P>
Clean fuels are a necessary component of any strategy to meet and maintain 
clean-air goals in Southern California and other major metropolitan areas. 
California air and energy officials have been sponsoring research and 
development activities with alcohol-fueled cars for a decade. The spotty recent 
history of the national clean-fuels program parallels the experience of the 
1960s and '70s with clean engines. Every year or two, some inventor or 
manufacturer comes up with a new design (or revives an old one that was lost or 
suppressed); publicity and public interest follow and legislation is introduced 
to mandate the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
In the classic American folk legend, Preston Tucker and his clean, efficient 
car are steam-rollered by nasty corporate giants whose profits are threatened. 
Similarly, every so often we enjoy a photo-feature on some farmer whose truck 
operates happily on chicken droppings or corncobs. These stories aren't false, 
they just don't provide a good basis for federal law. We only have to look back 
a few years to find serious efforts to mandate diesel engines as a cleaner 
alternative to gasoline. Remember the Wankel engine, once touted as the 
solution to Detroit's problems? Or Cornelius Dutcher and his steam-powered car? 
</P>
<P>
Because elected officials lack the time, expertise and long-term focus to make 
wise choices about emerging technologies, Congress chose in 1970 to set 
long-term, tough standards beyond the reach of then-available emissions-control 
technology. Lawmakers then left the choice of method to the private sector, 
with strong guidance from the federal Environmental Protection Agency. 
Ironically, Bush's attempt to find a moderate environmental position, so 
clearly evidenced in the acid rain and toxics portions of the plan, appears to 
be a radical shift in philosophy. It directs a transformation of U.S. fuel 
usage, away from oil toward natural gas (the raw material from which methanol 
is produced, or which can be used directly as fuel in liquid or compressed 
form) and grain-derived alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The major obstacle to greater use of clean fuels is uncertainty about which 
fuel-engine combination will have the best score on a number of different 
tests, including cost to the ultimate consumer, performance in real-world 
driving conditions and actual -- as opposed to laboratory -- environmental 
benefits. The expense to producers, distributors, retailers and the general 
public of a complete changeover in basic fuel supply dictates caution on the 
part of industry in making major investments until there is a clear signal from 
government about which system will be subsidized through complex tax and 
regulatory incentives. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the largest fleet- testing program on methanol, a leading 
competitor in the clean-fuel sweepstakes, was conducted by Carnegie-Mellon 
University. It unequivocally showed that air-quality benefits to be derived 
from total conversion are far less than earlier projections. That doesn't rule 
out methanol as a future automotive fuel, but it strongly supports a more 
flexible approach to setting future standards. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than mandating auto makers to build cars that run on a specified fuel or 
fuels, a strategy more likely to succeed in producing optimum clean-air 
benefits at least cost would be for Congress to set a medium-term 1995 emission 
standard of one-tenth of a gram per mile of hydrocarbons. That is less than 
half the toughest standard currently proposed, but only slightly lower than the 
standard proposed by the natural-gas industry for cars using the equivalent of 
methanol. 
</P>
<P>
Give EPA some money -- a modest but not unreasonable amount -- to convene task 
fores of technical experts from the automotive and energy industries to reach a 
recommendation, plus some additional development of production-line vehicles. 
And make the standard applicable for the full life of the car, not the 50,000 
miles in current federal law, to eliminate the incentive to make emissions 
controls the least-durable car component. 
</P>
<P>
An integrated approach to emissions from cars that reflects in-use performance 
and the wide range of possible fuels could lead to an added benefit: 
refineries, currently a major source of stationary source pollution, might 
close down and move out of the Los Angeles area. It might also lead to a 
multilevel auto market: reformulated gasoline used for longer commutes and 
travel; electric cars that could be plugged in at new, off-peak nighttime rates 
used for the second (or in Los Angeles, the third) family car. 
</P>
<P>
The Clean Air Act technically expired years ago and has been kept alive by 
budgetary appropriations pending some agreement between the President and 
Congress on the future course of efforts to attain healthful air. Now that we 
have a President willing to make some real commitments to that goal, it's time 
to look for a better way to approach the transformation of our transportation 
system as part of the solution.

PRESIDENT BUILDS NEW PROGRAMS HEADING TO A SECOND HONEYMOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David R. Gergen, David R. Gergen, White House communications director during 
Ronald Reagan's first term, is editor-at-large for U.S. News &amp; World 
Report.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time for George Bush to revive an old romance. Nineteen years ago, after 
he lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White 
House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard M. Nixon, who had encouraged 
the race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about 
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations? OK, said Bush, and he launched an 
international career that put him on the road to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White 
House say that he had a different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe 
even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, 
drawing on his days as an oilman and as member of the House Ways and Means 
Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Though he hasn't been a close student of the economy since then, Bush could 
serve the country well if he returned to his old interest in economic affairs. 
By fall, he should unveil a plan for economic renewal. For both Bush and the 
economy, this is an ideal time to strike. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four weeks, Bush has vaulted into his strongest political position 
since taking office. His arms proposal in Europe seemed to liberate him from a 
cautious past. Suddenly he gained his bearings -- with his handling of the 
China crisis, a clean air proposal, blockage of a minimum wage proposal and 
House passage of most of his savings-and-loan bailout. An early June Gallup 
poll showed his popularity climbing 14 points to 70%, highest of the year. And 
that was before his call for cleaner air -- a sure winner. After a dangerously 
slow start, Bush may now begin a second honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
He has seized the high ground just as Congress is falling off the charts in 
public esteem. While the Democrats have now elected stronger leaders in the 
House, they are likely to be far more conciliatory than anyone imagined six 
months ago. For the first time since the Vietnam War, the flow of power away 
from the White House to the Congress may end. Ronald Reagan was more formidable 
than Bush in his first year, but he could never reverse the tide. Bush might -- 
if he sets a more ambitious agenda for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
With the tectonic plates shifting in geopolitics, Bush might be tempted to 
spend his time in the diplomatic arena. He clearly feels more at home there. 
And he enjoys the company of his foreign policy team. Recently, he has been on 
the phone as many as a dozen times a day with his pal, Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while the United States must pay close heed to the breakup of the communist 
empire, the White House has an equally large stake in troubles brewing back 
home. The U.S. economy may seem strong today -- and the Administration has the 
statistics to prove it -- but, in private, serious thinkers in the government 
admit the foundations are rusting and need repair. America's position as the 
preeminent economic power is eroding. 
</P>
<P>
The case should not be overstated. U.S. workers are still the most productive. 
The U.S. economy remains more than twice the size of the Japanese. During the 
1980s, while the number of jobs in Western Europe increased by two million, the 
United States created nearly 16 million new jobs -- and more than half are 
high-paying. Yet, some basic trend lines are moving in the wrong direction. As 
studies point out, U.S. productivity levels have been rising less rapidly 
during the 1980s than many nations in Asia and Europe. The U.S. savings rate, 
traditionally anemic, has sunk to a level four times below the Japanese. The 
federal debt is now so large that all personal tax collections west of the 
Mississippi were barely enough to pay last year's interest payments on the 
national debt. And where did those payments go? About $30 billion were sent to 
foreign creditors, twice as much as Washington spent on housing in a nation 
where a scandalous number of people sleep on sidewalk grates. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s promise not much better. A private document prepared by the Japanese 
Economic Planning Agency projects the Japanese economy will grow at a rate 
nearly twice that of America's from now through the year 2000, and Japanese per 
capita income will surpass that of the United States. The Japanese also expect 
Western Europe to grow more rapidly than America. Among prominent U.S. 
economists, C. Fred Bergsten now expects that because of the renewed strength 
of the dollar, the U.S. trade deficit will widen to $200 billion a year during 
the early 1990s and overall U.S. debt overseas will exceed $1 trillion by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The perception is now spreading in Asia and Western Europe that the United 
States cannot manage its own affairs. Business leaders return from Japan 
complaining about being treated with a new arrogance. One chief executive 
officer of a major corporation recently visited Tokyo to see old Japanese 
friends from the Harvard Business School. At dinner, he said, they were as 
jovial as in student days, but in their offices the next morning, they were all 
icy condescension and lectured him on U.S. business practices. 
</P>
<P>
Implications stretch far beyond individual relationships. During most of the 
postwar period, the United States called the shots because of its overwhelming 
military and economic might. But as the United States and Soviet Union 
dismantle forces, military strength will no longer command the same obeisance. 
Economic might will be decisive and economic rivalries will displace military 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has already moved from clear dominance in the West to a 
position of first among equals. As Bush said in Europe, the United States 
should welcome a sharing of leadership with others. After all, the rise of 
Western Europe and Japan has been a U.S. goal since the war. But sharing No. 1 
is a far cry from being No. 2. Japan and West Germany are already causing 
jitters as they grow more independent. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons both historic and apparently racial, the rise of Japan most upsets 
America. A poll last year found, by 57% to 37%, Americans feel that Japanese 
economic competition poses a greater threat to U.S. national security than 
Soviet military power. In the Pentagon, there are reportedly whispers about 
plans for a potential fight with the Japanese. In a recent Atlantic magazine 
cover article, James Fallows, who has been living in Asia, called for a U.S. 
"containment" policy toward Japan, echoing the famous article George F. Kennan 
wrote four decades ago about the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
These are sentiments that a U.S. President must channel into more constructive 
directions. There are some around Bush who would prefer not to rock the boat. 
They see an economic recovery rolling through its seventh year. So why take on 
a bold project that can misfire? The answer is easy: That's why we have a 
President. His first responsibility is to attend to the nation's largest needs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush would capture the country if he went before a joint session of Congress 
with a plan of economic renewal. Borrowing a title from an organization started 
a few years ago, he could rally the public behind a crusade to "Rebuild 
America." And he could insure Democratic support if he then took Democratic 
congressional leaders along with GOP leaders to Camp David to develop a 
legislative attack. How could the Democrats resist his call to "keep America 
No. 1"? 
</P>
<P>
The summer months provide a useful time for the Bush team to assemble its 
package. As with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plan, Bush could call 
on key advisers, headed perhaps by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and 
Budget Director Richard G. Darman, to piece together the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Resolution of the Budget Crisis. With tax revenues flowing into Washington 
at an unexpectedly high rate, some congressional leaders believe it may be 
possible to bring the budget deficit down without a tax increase. But inside 
the Administration, skeptics think it will require a combination of higher 
taxes and painful spending cuts to force Bush to break his no-tax pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Bush's stand against higher taxes should give him bargaining 
leverage in persuading congressional Democrats to cut long-term capital gains 
and trim back entitlement programs. Bush can gain more support for a budget 
plan if he earmarks part of the tax increase for education or an anti-drug 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increasing savings and investment. Reducing the deficit will automatically 
increase the country's savings rate. But even then, savings would be too low 
for long-term economic health. While economists dispute how well government can 
lure people to save more, evidence suggests that individual retirement accounts 
have been effective. Two of Bush's top lieutenants, chief economist Michael J. 
Boskin and domestic adviser Roger B. Porter, have studied ways to improve 
savings, and the President should direct them to come up with a new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Educational overhaul. Secondary school systems in most major cities have 
collapsed. Parents across the country are looking for help. The Bush 
Administration says it doesn't have any money -- which is true. In the early 
days of the Reagan Administration, however, Education Secretary Terrel H. Bell 
proved a hard-hitting campaign led by a President and fired-up citizens could 
help schools without a lot more cash. If Bush truly wants to become an 
education President, he needs to gear up a massive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strategic industries. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher recognizes 
that the United States must encourage key industries -- especially high 
technology -- that will provide the necessary muscle for new economic growth. 
He is looking at alternatives to spur a high-definition TV industry. Bush ought 
to jump into the middle of this debate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Modernizing transportation. The Government Accounting Office has estimated 
it will cost over $300 billion to renew roads, bridges, airports and other 
sinews of an efficient economy. Bush should ask Transportation Secretary Samuel 
K. Skinner to accelerate current efforts to draw up a national transportation 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
There are many other candidates for a renewal package: health care, child care 
or a revision of anti-trust laws. But the critical point is for Bush to get 
started. Polls show that by overwhelming majorities, Americans would welcome a 
greater emphasis on domestic needs. The President should direct that energy 
toward a more competitive economy. 
</P>
<P>
Western Europe and Japan are engaged in enormous enterprises to build their 
economies. If the United States coasts, it could drift into potentially 
dangerous splits with both. But if America pulls itself up as well, the three 
forces acting together could create a vast, open market -- with over 600 
million consumers -- that could remake the world.

CHINESE MASSACRE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "A Letter From China" (Op-Ed Page, June 7), an official of a Chinese 
corporation near Hong Kong lamented that the Chinese government had become a 
"Fascist government" and China's People's Liberation Army had become a "Fascist 
army." He makes the same error as many Westerners unable to see the true 
totalitarian face of communism. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and its "Liberation" army remain what they have always 
been, a Communist government and a Communist army and they behave like 
Communist institutions invariably behave, zealous of power and harsh on those 
who dare to challenge it.

PHOENIX HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How I wish the Lake View Terrace families wrenched by drug abuse could have 
joined me last summer at the Phoenix House rehabilitation center in Orange 
County (Part I, May 27). 
</P>
<P>
As an interim volunteer in the Nancy Reagan Center fund-raising effort, I 
researched long-term success rates and verified that prestigious nonprofit 
Phoenix House ranked among the best. But most convincing was the time I spent 
with the enthusiastic participants at the Santa Ana facility. They are 
clean-cut, clear-eyed testimony that the Phoenix House program works. 
</P>
<P>
For Lake View Terrace to be elated over the center's defeat in their community 
is sad but conceivable. But for their city councilman, Ernani Bernardi, to call 
it "a victory" is sad and unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House will no doubt take its outstanding program elsewhere now. What a 
loss for Los Angeles County.

I just returned from a two-month stay in the Soviet Union. The Soviet

On June 10, The Times reported on China, "U.S. Calls Reprisals Against 
Dissident Leaders Repugnant." In the same issue it was also reported, "U.S. 
Vetoes U.N. Resolution Condemning Israel on Arab Areas." 
</P>
<P>
The excuse for this latest unanimous U.N. vote against Israel (excepting us, of 
course) was that the resolution did not carry a condemnation of the Palestinian 
"violence." 
</P>
<P>
As the historical facts show, these people are fighting for their freedom and 
that the basic mode of resistance has been stones against guns. Further facts 
are that it has been for the most part children who have been the victims of 
this ongoing policy. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, there has been a number of letters condemning Conrad for his cartoons 
on Israel (June 8 and 12). Quite typically these letters summon up the old 
Israel is a "democracy" bit, and point fingers at others such as Syria, the 
Soviet Union, and now with the new opportunity of diverting attention away from 
Israel we are supposed to direct our righteousness towards China. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. does not give any of these nations $3.5 billion a year as we do for 
Israel. Since the intifada began in December, 1987, we have given Israel $5 
billion. This comes out to $10 million for each Palestinian killed. 
</P>
<P>
A thorough knowledge of what is behind this undaunted support of Israel 
assaults one's very sense of national respect. Americans should start to ask 
themselves what is it that compels children to lay down their lives time and 
time and time again, and what is behind our support of this Israeli policy 
while we go chasing after everything else?

A TARDY TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For three years beginning in mid-1950, the United States committed millions of 
men and billions of dollars to an international effort that prevented the 
conquest of South Korea by the Communist regime to its north. That undertaking 
initially commanded broad support among the American people. In time, though, 
it became both a subject of major domestic political controversy and, even as 
it was still being fought, a matter of increasing public apathy. A conflict 
that produced some of the most dramatic and heroic episodes in U.S. military 
history and -- after China intervened with its forces in late 1950 -- did much 
to set the course of Sino-American relations for the next two decades, 
eventually came to be thought of as the Forgotten War. 
</P>
<P>
It would be more proper, of course, to see the conflict in Korea as one that 
has been simply neglected in American historical consciousness. For certainly 
it has not been and never will be forgotten by those who fought there, or by 
the families of the dead, the wounded and the missing, or by the hundreds of 
thousands of U.S. servicemen who subsequently were assigned to South Korea to 
help safeguard that country's security, an obligation that continues to this 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, in this nation that tends to be both generous and sometimes not too 
choosy in erecting monuments to events and persons both great and 
insignificant, U.S. participation and sacrifices in the Korean War have never 
received adequate official national recognition. That oversight is at last 
about to be corrected. If the final $2.8 million that is needed for a privately 
funded $6-million memorial can soon be raised, a 2-acre site across the 
reflecting pool from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., could 
be dedicated by June 25, 1991, the 41st anniversary of North Korea's invasion 
of South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
More than 54,000 Americans died in the Korean War, of whom 33,629 were killed 
in action. Another 103,284 were wounded; of these, more than 2,000 subsequently 
died. The missing in action totaled 5,866, and more than 2,700 men died in 
captivity. When the war was over, those who had fought came home and for the 
most part, without parades or speeches or other ceremony, quietly reintegrated 
themselves into civilian life. The nation has been too long in suitably 
remembering the services they performed.

CHINESE MASSACRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our first reaction to China's cynical denial of the killings in Tian An Men 
Square is outrage. But we remind ourselves that the Big Lie is in the universal 
tradition of statecraft -- some lies are just bigger than others and some liars 
more brazen. 
</P>
<P>
Still, how can the Chinese leadership possibly think it can get away with it, 
given the witnesses and evidence on film? By comparison, even the decision to 
fire on the demonstrators -- the tragic and brutal reaction of autocrats 
fearing a threat to the state -- seems "logical." 
</P>
<P>
The dreaded answer appears to be that the Big Lie is being orchestrated 
precisely because the Chinese leadership is turning the clock back and 
reimposing political repression and isolation. Yet Deng Xiaoping reaffirms 
China's goal of economic modernization. How can Deng expect that political and 
economic freedoms will be kept distinct and apart? How does he imagine the Big 
Lie will survive his Long March generation? How can he not realize, on the 
evidence of Mao and Stalin, that his Big Lie will be a deadly legacy to his 
successors that will surely further undermine communism's legitimacy? 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, this myopia is just the latest manifestation of an old condition: After 
over a hundred generations, old men in China still cannot adjust to change or 
learn when or how to let go of power.

ALICE KAHN: LIFE ON THE OPEN ROAD LEADS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's one of those mornings. A beautiful, clear, hot, sunny morning -- too hot 
to work but not to dream. It's the kind of morning that makes you want to get 
in the car and just drive, drive, drive. 
</P>
<P>
And in your mind's eye, you see yourself doing it. You've done it before. 9 
a.m. The kids are gone. The husband's gone. There's just you and the heat and 
the open road. 
</P>
<P>
So you put on some nice clothes, comb your hair and actually look at yourself. 
Maybe a little lipstick. You could look good if you tried. 
</P>
<P>
The car door slamming might be the opening salvo in a new life. Roll down the 
windows. Turn up the radio. Leave off the seat belt. You're something wild, 
babe. 
</P>
<P>
On the radio, there's old K.T. Oslin, "the '80s lady," singing about how she 
woke up this morning bound and determined to leave. She got only as far as "the 
edge of town." 
</P>
<P>
You can beat that. You can get to the next town. 
</P>
<P>
You switch stations because country music with the open road is a cliche. You 
get The Boss singing "Pink Cadillac." And you imagine that you are some babe in 
a halter top with her hair hanging down. 
</P>
<P>
THE GUY AT THE LIGHT 
</P>
<P>
When you get to the light, you wink at a guy in a red convertible. But when the 
light changes, you floor your Toyota and peel away. 
</P>
<P>
You hit the search button. You get some '50s stuff. You're getting sick of '50s 
stuff, but you never turn off Santo and Johnny's "Sleep Walk." And you remember 
playing hooky. You remember hot mornings when you got to school after studying 
for the quiz on polynomials and doing your paper on "Romeo and Juliet: Could It 
Happen Again?" You saw your boyfriend, and the two of you went off for the 
whole day. 
</P>
<P>
You remember everything about that day now, 25 years later -- the greasy fries, 
the red '57 Ford convertible, the hot sand at the beach, the smell of Old 
Spice. And you picture that poor boyfriend today, twice-divorced and sweating 
in some office. 
</P>
<P>
ESCAPE FROM THE MOB 
</P>
<P>
You hit the button fast. You get the jazz station. McCoy Tyner plays the sound 
track from the movie about your escape from the mob. You ratted on John (Johnny 
the Saint) Santos. He broke your heart, that lying dog. But now you're off to 
Phoenix to start a new life in the franchised nail salon business. You've dyed 
your hair blond, and you've gotten green contacts. You didn't tell the Feds. 
The Feds can't protect you. And, sure enough, there -- in the rear view -- is 
Johnny. 
</P>
<P>
Poignant piano solo. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, you are out of town. You've been driving for an hour. You park and 
look around. You find the thrift shop. You buy a little statue of a geisha with 
a parasol all in chartreuse and maroon. Very '40s. And only a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
You find the local coffee shop. No caffe latte. No espresso. The place is 
called "Vi's." It's just perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Vi herself is standing at the counter pouring. She's the quintessential gal. 
Fiftysomething, harlequin glasses, a beige checkered uniform with a folded, 
pressed handkerchief fanning out above the pocket, which is embroidered with 
the letters V and I. 
</P>
<P>
"Vi, you sold my jelly doughnut," says the guy in the Tyner's Feed Grain shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"McCoy, you eat one more doughnut and you'll bust your jeans," laughs the guy 
in the John Deere cap who's lapping up his egg yolk with a bit of toast. 
</P>
<P>
"Just coffee . . . black," I say, and grab the Independent Press Gazette. If I 
couldn't hide out in a newspaper, I would die. 
</P>
<P>
Vi pours the coffee so slowly that I have to look up. "Go home, honey," she 
says. "Go home to your family. They're all you've ever wanted. There's nothing 
out here but people sadder and more bored than you." 
</P>
<P>
I leave Vi a $2 tip. I'm home by noon. Enough time to live out my life.

SHORT TAKES: AN ART FORM BASED ON DOMINO THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He calls himself a "Domineer." Right now, he's a New Jersey lifeguard, in 
training for his 75th marathon. Running is his real love. This week, though, 
he'll assume his other persona for an appearance in Torrance's Del Amo Fashion 
Center. What he'll be doing there is what's been paying the freight for a 
decade: setting up rows of dominoes and then knocking 'em down. "Hey," he says, 
"it's a living." 
</P>
<P>
He's Bobby Speca, 32, and you may have seen him on Carson or "That's 
Incredible" or in the Guinness Book of World Records. Once he set in motion a 
spectacular chain reaction of exactly 111,111 dominoes, falling not just in a 
row but up ramps and around corners and down elevators and off mini-high dives 
. . . "The setup took two weeks," he says, "and the topple took 32 minutes. 
I've subsequently lost the record -- some fellow in West Germany has done 
something like 280,000 -- but I'm still the patriarch of the art, and the only 
guy who makes a living out of it." 
</P>
<P>
For commercial enterprises, Speca charges 15 cents per domino, plus expenses. 
For the Del Amo opening of STOR, a furniture outlet, he'll publicly set up 
11,111 dominoes Friday; knock them down Saturday from 11 a.m. to precisely 
11:03; conduct a workshop from noon to 1; judge a toppling contest for a while, 
and be home in time for a Sunday run. 
</P>
<P>
Since he was inspired by a high school math teacher, Speca has expanded his 
arcane art to include configurations with Darryl Dawkins-like titles: the "DNA 
Double Helix," "Delayed Dynamic Dozen," "Bahama Tom Inverted Cascade Slide for 
Life" -- all, of course, with tongue in cheek, bank statement in black and the 
secure knowledge that Billy Crystal has asked him for his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
A down-to-Earth dreamer with Mensa credentials and degrees from Penn in 
astronomy and physics, Speca has toppled outsized dominoes underwater and 
speculates on what would happen in outer space ("You'd have to magnetize the 
bottoms . . . "). 
</P>
<P>
Mainly, he is one of those rare people who love what they're doing. "If I look 
back and think, 'Gee, all I did was the Iron Man Triathlon 30 times and a 
couple hundred marathons, and throughly enjoy life,' will I feel guilty? Nah." 
</P>
<P>
Serious Episodes With Comedy 
</P>
<P>
The idea occurred to television writer Ruth Bennett when she was "back in the 
Midwest, reading in the papers about a case in Detroit, and another in Ohio 
where they actually burned down a house." Bennett -- longtime producer and 
writer of "Family Ties" who left to do her own show, "Duet" -- had wanted to 
write one more script for "Ties" before it went off the air, "and I wanted it 
to be something with some weight to it." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a rousing two-parter dealing with the problems faced by a 
black family moving into the Keatons' all-white neighborhood, a move contested 
not only by overt racists but by "well-meaning" whites placing property values 
over human worth. It was tricky but it worked, so well that it garnered for 
Bennett the first Blanche Rosloff Award, presented this month by the Westside 
Housing Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the sort of thing that happens in every neighborhood," Bennett 
concedes, "but it's still happening enough to keep the council busy in West 
L.A. As a matter of fact, they're fighting three cases right now." 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with tough issues through comedy -- thus assuring a wide audience -- is 
"a difficult art," says Bennett, who's also done a piece on alcoholism for 
"Ties," another on illiteracy for "Duet." "It's a real balancing act. You have 
to make sure that you don't belittle your subject, that you don't poke fun in 
the wrong places." For Bennett, it works just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning Death of a Salesman 
</P>
<P>
Susan Tanner called. Dad had died. Dad was Harry. Harry Tanner. Oldest -- and 
arguably oddest -- car salesman in America. Maybe the world. 
</P>
<P>
Harry would have been 89 this week. In April, he was Salesman of the Month at 
Claude Short Dodge in Santa Monica. He had worked through the middle of May, 
when the cancer he had licked came back to get him. "It was almost as if he'd 
rather die than not work," said Susan. "He had a horror of being a useless, 
crotchety old man in robe and slippers on the front porch." 
</P>
<P>
Even besides his appetite for literature, Harry was different, no doubt about 
it. "An oddity," Susan called him. "Selling cars is hardly one of the world's 
most revered professions, but Harry was that rare kind of salesman whom people 
trusted. He never cheated anybody. He always tried to give a good deal to 
people who wouldn't ordinarily have an edge in the economic system -- the 
young, the ethnic minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, given his bent for the fair shake, Harry moved about some. "He 
probably sold everything ever made in his lifetime," said Susan. "He believed 
strongly in a cooperative society, and he was fired once for having copies of 
the (anti-nuclear) Stockholm Peace Petition in the trunk of his car. So he 
opened his own dealership, in Westwood. He'd get involved with all those 
student artists who couldn't pay their bills, and he'd accept a trade. His 
house is still filled with beautiful paintings, swapped for repair jobs." 
</P>
<P>
He loved people, said his daughter, loved to schmooze, but "he couldn't stand 
people who couldn't make up their minds. In '88, he got my husband and I what 
he called a 'good deal' on a new Colt. I didn't like the color. I asked him 
could we wait and think about it. He said, 'The deal's good for today . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
Along with a spotless rep, Harry left Susan three things: "He taught me to 
respect the working class and library books; to fight for a better world, and 
never to cross a picket line. He was quite a man." DICK RORABACK

ERMA BOMBECK: THE FUZZY NEW ROLES OF TODAY'S FATHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few women will be surprised to learn that when they marry, they choose a man 
"just like dear old dad." 
</P>
<P>
I loved my dad. I have a picture of both of us on a river bank in Covington, 
Ohio. He is holding a 29 1/2-pound carp. We look like we just won a lottery. A 
couple of hours after that picture was taken, my dad ordered me out of the boat 
with my mother and said if I so much as stepped foot in it again, it would be 
over his dead body. I made too much noise and scared the fish away. He ordered 
my mom to do something with me. He didn't care what! 
</P>
<P>
He was always saying that. "Do something with her. Make her stop crying. Feed 
her. Take her to the bathroom. Clean her up. Better take her temperature. She's 
calling for you." (This in the middle of the night.) 
</P>
<P>
I was his child, but I was Mom's job. They didn't have "bonding" in his day. 
When I was born, he was nowhere in sight. That was a woman's job, too, and he 
got "out of the way" and let her do it. It was the same thing with discipline. 
"Listen to your mother when she speaks. She has my permission to whip your 
backside, so don't think you can get away with something while I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
So what did he do? To begin with, he was the head of our family. He spoke for 
us. He planned the vacations. He dictated when we ate and when we slept. Even 
when I was little, I had the sense that when he left the house in the morning 
with his lunch, whatever he did, he did it for us. He provided our lives with 
the basics and a few goodies. He was the tower of strength that we could lean 
on. Even when I was afraid to go into the basement, he never was. On rare 
occasions when he kissed me or cried, it made me feel wonderful that I could do 
that to him. There was never any question of being wanted and loved. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I don't think my father would be judged a good one by today's 
standards. And maybe that's what we're doing to the fathers of the '80s -- 
judging them by a father standard we no longer support. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere between my dad and today's fathers, the rules changed. New lines were 
drawn. Expectations were added. Their roles are fuzzy, to say the least. One 
moment they're supposed to "share the child," and the next they're being told, 
"I'll raise my son alone. Just make sure your support checks are on time." One 
minute their presence is vital, and the next, in a world according to Garp, a 
single mother wants a child but not a husband. If they're confused, maybe it's 
because many have emulated their fathers. That's where they learned about 
fathering. 
</P>
<P>
The "father track" is still under major construction. There are breakdowns, 
detours and sometimes nine miles of bad road on the march to where they're 
supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
Women may marry someone who is like "dear old dad," but if they're lucky, 
they'll get more than they bargained for.

ON VIEW: A PELL-MELL WHIRL FOR MADAME MICHELE ROCARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madame Michele Rocard, a sociologist and the wife of French Prime Minister 
Michel Rocard, was in town fresh from Houston and Oscar and Lynn Wyatt Jr.'s 
black-tie dinner in their River Oaks home; from Ft. Worth and partying with 
Elton and Martha Hyder; from Dallas and a view of the Murchison art collection 
with Lupe Murchison; from San Francisco with art tours and lunch with Mr. and 
Mrs. John Rosekrans. 
</P>
<P>
She was still standing and she set Los Angeles on a pell-mell whirl. French 
Consul Gen. Gerard Coste entertained at his consular residence in Beverly Hills 
and later at dinner at Ma Maison. Next day, Michael Eisner helicoptered her to 
Disneyland for lunch; then she visited Fox studios, and that evening dined with 
movie moguls at the home of Howard Ruby and Yvette Mimieux Ruby. (Ronald and 
Nancy Reagan were guests, too, as were David Hockney and Betsy Bloomingdale.) 
</P>
<P>
The next day was museum day -- the Getty, MOCA (for lunch) and a tour of 
Frederick Weisman's contemporary collection before dinner at Spago. The day 
Rocard departed she was whisked to Los Olivos Ranch to see Douglas Cramer's 
art, all under the skillful planning of international marketing consultant 
Andre R. Dunstetter. Sounds royal to us. 
</P>
<P>
HIGH UP: "When you get angry with the world, come up and have a drink and look 
out over the whole world," said City Club on Bunker Hill chairman Walter Beran. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman/Sachs' Peter and Robin Barber, founding members, were standing by, 
looking out over traffic clogs from the 54th floor of the Wells Fargo Center. 
Beran turned around. Was owner Robert Maguire on his way for this club 
inauguration? No, he was caught in traffic. Without him, Beran, his wife, 
Speedy, and as many of the 635 Founding Members as could, crowded between the 
doorways. 
</P>
<P>
The ribbon was cut, and recut, and recut, with Jane Arnault, George Pla, Sam 
Williams, Stanley Sanders all in photo focus. So, it's official. The club's 
open. To show off the fare, chefs set dining tables with the cuisine. The 
Bunker Hill Berger will be $7.50, the Cobb Salad Bunker Hill $8. 
</P>
<P>
After all, you need a good buy with a $4,000 membership with $110 monthly dues. 
Dallas Club Corp. of America senior v.p. Charles A. Reichert beamed about the 
mounds of shrimp, caviar and fruit prepared for the crowd, and he ignored the 
missing banquet cushion in one room because the damask didn't arrive. Taking it 
all in -- the two dining rooms, the privite dining suites, the bar/lounge -- 
were Ron Parker, Daniel Dworsky, Joe Mullin, Japanese Consul Gen. Hiromoto 
Seki, Bill Vaughn, Nelson C. Rising, Richard and Betty Koshalek, Stanley and 
Melba Sanders, Greg Doerschlag, Marilyn Hudson and son Paul, Aram Arakelian 
(the general contractor) and Tom Burke. 
</P>
<P>
TOP VISITORS: United Way of America national chairman Edward Brennan (also 
chairman and CEO of Sears, Roebuck and Co.) has challenged United Way of 
Greater Los Angeles to double its commitment (last year $88 million). . . . 
Wyoming Governor Mike Sullivan addressed Town Hall. . . . Madame Anne d'Ornano, 
mayor of Deauville, France, was the attraction at cocktails at Hermes on Rodeo 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
PLAUDITS: The Rotary Club of Los Angeles, the famed LA-5 chapter, turned 80 
last week at the Los Angeles Hilton amid the toot of birthday horns and a 
birthday cake of balloons. Incoming president of Rotary International Hugh 
Archer flew in. President Victor L. Walch presented $100,000 to Police Chief 
Gates for D.A.R.E. drug abuse programs now in 50,000 classrooms in 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
Rotary leaders, including John C. Westwarter and William Plunkett, were on hand 
to hear Carl P. Miller, a member of the club for 50 years and a donor of $1 
million to Rotary in 1974, say: "We have you in our will -- we have a very 
substantial gift for you." His wife, Ruth, nodded approval.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: THESE POST CARDS CAN OFFER GREETINGS OF DECEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
"Congratulations," it said on the post card mailed from Trans-American 
Vacations in Sparta, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The message, signed by company coordinator Joanne Kennedy, continued: "You have 
been selected by Sweepstakes Clearinghouse to receive an exciting luxury cruise 
to the Grand Bahamas for a five-day, four-night stay in Freeport, plus a 
five-day, four-night stay in the Orlando/Disney World area, in fabulous 
Florida." 
</P>
<P>
Other post cards, mailed by other Sparta companies called Holiday House or 
Resorts Travel, and signed by Donna Johnson and Jennifer Regan, respectively, 
offered similar congratulatory messages for luxury Bahamian cruises as well as 
Mexico vacations. 
</P>
<P>
When recipients called to collect their prizes they were told that there would 
be a "small service fee" of $289, followed by additional costs. I received 
three of these cards in one week and called the number on one of them to 
collect my "prize." 
</P>
<P>
Here's what it really was: The "luxury cruise" was a large seagoing ferry 
complete with casino. No cabins, just seats. The operator also said I could get 
a free hotel in Manzanillo, Mexico, "where they shot that fabulous movie '10.' 
" The cost: $289 per person. Of course, I could upgrade my accommodations for 
an additional charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you give me your Visa or MasterCard to accept this offer?" she asked. I 
said I'd think about it. "I'm sorry, you have to accept this award now or you 
can't have it," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, thousands of Americans, thinking they were getting a bargain, 
gave out their credit card numbers to this and dozens of other travel and tour 
operators whom federal investigators claim were defrauding the public. 
</P>
<P>
Nine Sparta travel companies mailed tens of thousands of post cards a day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was staggering," said James Wheeler, U.S. postmaster for Sparta. "It was 
much more than we could handle. In one week they mailed out more than a million 
cards. We couldn't process them here, so we had to truck them to Nashville." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before the complaints started. By last December so many 
complaints had been filed with the Tennessee attorney general that the state 
filed suit against the nine travel companies, alleging that they had violated 
the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
According to the attorney general's suit announced in January, the companies 
"sent out post cards to consumers, leading them to believe that they had won a 
free vacation when, in fact, they were required to pay for a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"The companies reportedly made unauthorized charges on consumer credit cards, 
failed to disclose to consumers (that) . . . extra charges applied to the 
vacation packages, and used fictitious names in written and oral correspondence 
with consumers." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also charged the companies with "failure . . . to deliver vacation 
packages, failure to give consumers sufficient time to decide whether to 
purchase the package, and failure to disclose clearly the refund policy." 
</P>
<P>
The companies deny the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Utterly false," Bill Austin, co-owner of Southeastern Travel in Sparta, said. 
"We think of ourselves as the vacation capital of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Federal investigators believe that Sparta (population 4,800) is the 
travel scam capital of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I know all the other people who run these companies," Austin said, "and we're 
not con men. We give people a great vacation deal. And we sold more than 
100,000 vacations. Only 600 people complained." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," said one postal inspector, "the complaints were in the thousands. 
But we only recorded the written complaints." 
</P>
<P>
As a direct result of the suit and a subsequent temporary restraining order, 
Austin's company -- and others -- agreed to insert a disclaimer at the bottom 
of each post card that reads: "This is not an all-expense-paid vacation." 
</P>
<P>
But the boiler-room sales tactics continued, according to investigators. Soon 
the Tennessee attorney general's office was not the only agency interested in 
Sparta. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year most of the complaints have been received from 
out of state. Many of the complainants charge these Sparta firms with 
high-pressure tactics designed to get their credit card account numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very busy on this case," said Nancy Miller, a postal inspector 
based in Memphis. "In just the past few months we've received 405 written 
complaints about Southeastern Travel alone." 
</P>
<P>
On May 1 postal inspectors and Secret Service agents ran a sting on one of the 
companies. Agents posed as potential customers who had received the post cards. 
Conversations were tape recorded. 
</P>
<P>
When operators asked for credit cards, numbers were given, but the callers 
specifically requested that they not be charged until they had time to think it 
over. In each case the credit card account was charged. 
</P>
<P>
On May 1, armed with a search warrant, agents raided Southeastern Travel and 
seized two boxes of documents, including credit card charge slips. 
</P>
<P>
Eight days later, postal inspectors got U.S. District Judge Thomas Higgins to 
issue a temporary restraining order against another Tennessee company called 
The Processing Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Nashville firm mailed certified letters nationwide, advising recipients 
they were an "award claim" winner. Prizes included a new car, a $5,000 savings 
bond and two round-trip airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the "winners" were given their travel "prizes." But in order to 
validate their claim the winners had to pay a processing fee of about $30, had 
to make reservations through a specific travel agency and had to stay at a 
hotel for a minimum of six nights (rates were as high as $120 a night). 
</P>
<P>
And the vacation trip was good only in Orlando, Fla. Temporary restraining 
orders also were issued against two similar companies operating from 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
"Fraud investigations are very slow," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she added, "one thing is clear. If someone wants you to send money to 
claim something you've supposedly won, forget it."

RIDING 'TRAIN OF MANY SOULS' THROUGH MALAYSIA

SINGAPORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're rolling north toward Bangkok, and the moon has been stealing through the 
rice paddies for hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey you, American," whispers my Thai seatmate, Song Mai. 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes don't rivet like a Westerner's. They open and take me in as if I were 
a faintly remembered landscape. She passes a pint of Mae Khong whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't these trains always make you feel like a spy?" 
</P>
<P>
That's it! After logging 1,000 miles over almost every bit of track -- from 
Singapore's wharves to the beaches of Malaysia and Thailand's Golden Triangle 
-- I have met a fellow traveler who can find words for the feeling you get on 
Southeast Asia's trains. 
</P>
<P>
"See what I mean?" She points out the window with the whiskey bottle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Network of Canals 
</P>
<P>
The train has begun to brake. We shuffle along a network of canals called 
klongs. A warren of stilt houses covers the bank. Charcoal braziers burn in the 
doorways. Figures paddle narrow boats through the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
An old man, looking like a starved Buddha, stands up to his knees and naked in 
the moonshine on the klong, soaping his thighs in slow strokes. A girl leaps 
from porch to porch above the water, pursued by a band of boys waving a snake. 
For a second we can hear them laughing. 
</P>
<P>
That about sums things up. A typical interlude along what some call "the 
railway of many souls." 
</P>
<P>
The name comes from the popular notion that the Malay and Thai rail systems 
might have cost more lives to build than Cheops' Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
Since the British stretched the first tracks north of Singapore in 1903, about 
150,000 Malay, Chinese and Tamil coolies have lost their lives pushing the 
railway through equatorial jungle and swamp. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen thousand British, Dutch and Australian POWs died extending the "death 
railway" to Burma during the Japanese occupation in World War II. Cemeteries at 
the bridge over the River Kwai serve as unforgettable reminders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glimpses of Asia 
</P>
<P>
The backbone of this rail system is the Singapore-to-Bangkok line. At $100 for 
a second-class sleeper, the International Express is an inexpensive way to look 
beyond the "instant Asia" of package-tour fame. 
</P>
<P>
One can make the 642-mile trip in three days and two nights, but anyone wanting 
more than glimpses into Asia will break the trip into shorter legs. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore is a good place to begin. Aboard the northbound train you enter 
deeper into the grass-roots culture of the Malay Peninsula. On the morning 
express to Kuala Lampur you might have a seatmate like Haji, who came aboard in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
With an offer of "magical" beans, Haji made it clear to me that this would not 
be a trip where I could settle back in the air-conditioned coach and watch a 
movie or video. 
</P>
<P>
While the train slurred over streams and through the rolling hills of rubber 
and palm oil plantations, my new acquaintance announced: "I, Haji the Malay, 
son of the soil, have retired. Please congratulate me!" 
</P>
<P>
This was his way of introduction and he spoke to our entire end of the railway 
car. Looking a bit like Red Foxx, Haji spoke in clipped bursts and made people 
laugh with ironic twitches of his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-five years I spent my life selling. You name it, I have sold it. But 
enough; I quit. Like an honest Muslim I have made a good life for three wives 
and 14 children. Now . . . they will take care of me!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Like Singapore 
</P>
<P>
Haji said he was bound for the kampong (village) of his birth to spend the rest 
of his life talking with old friends and to "watch the monkeys play in the 
trees." A fetching idea. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the signs in Bahasa Malaysia, the domes of mosques and women 
swaddled like nuns in the Muslim buju kurongs, Kuala Lampur -- the capital of 
predominantly Islamic Malaysia -- looked like a smaller version of Singapore, 
so I continued north in search of Haji's more earthy Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
During the space of three days Penang Island bared Malaysia's ethnic diversity. 
With a population of 50% Malay, 35% Chinese and 10% Indian, this 25-year-old 
nation has suffered its share of racial struggles, but at Penang you feel none 
of the tension you might expect. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown, Penang's urban center, is just a ferry ride across the harbor from 
the train station in Butterworth. Much of this city of 400,000 looks as it did 
as a British colony 50 or 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dense neighborhoods of Indians and Chinese fill the heart of the city. Malay 
fishing kampongs dot the coast. Night markets, cafes, food stalls and bicycle 
rickshaws rule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hindu Procession 
</P>
<P>
On a single night I found myself absorbed by Chinese paper tigers and the sway 
of a Hindu procession -- drums, flutes, goddesses and all. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel rooms cost between $4 and $140, but almost all look out on this Asian 
mardi gras. Music in five languages pulses from the speakers of street vendors 
selling pirated cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds linger over coffee, fresh fruit juices, Dutch beer and satay chicken on 
skewers. Making friends is as easy as the common practice of sharing a table 
along the street. 
</P>
<P>
The Thai National Railway handles the Butterworth-Bangkok leg of the trip, and 
the service and equipment stand in contrast to the Malaysian trains. 
</P>
<P>
Where the Malays had large, modern cars the Thais offer 32-passenger fan-cooled 
sleepers. Each car has its own bank of washbasins, a shower and patrols of 
attendants standing ready to provide blankets, make beds, vend drinks and 
deliver multicourse, spicy meals to your seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought by Backpackers 
</P>
<P>
You might break the 24-hour trip to Bangok by stopping in Surat Thani and 
divert by bus and ferry to one of Thailand's southern resorts. Head east and 
you find Koh Samui, a primitive retreat favored by backpackers looking for 
little more than a grass A-frame on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
On the west coast of this thin peninsula, Phuket offers dramatic scenery and 
first-class services reminiscent of Jamaica or Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north the thoroughly Thai resorts of Cha-Am and Hua Hin could be 
alternative stops. Westerners will recognize parts of Hua Hin, particularly the 
Railway Hotel (now upgraded to a five-star resort), as a stand-in for Phnom 
Penh in the 1984 film, "The Killing Fields." 
</P>
<P>
In real life the town sways to the beat of a large fishing fleet and lively 
night market. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the southern portion of the rail line, which burrowed through the rubber 
and palm forests, the north leg races through the coastal plains of rice 
paddies bound by hedges of limestone mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath these peaks, peasants in black pajamas and straw hats pick rice, tend 
to their oxcarts and herd water buffalo as if it were a thousand years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Here, of course, Song Mai's voice offered a lilting commentary on everything we 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at my world, American," she said. "Very subtle Oriental loops of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
River Taxi Tour 
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok I headed for the nearest stop on the Chao Phraya River Express. For 
40 cents I bought an hour's escape on a river taxi and watched the sun set over 
the golden roofs of the temples and palaces that line the river. 
</P>
<P>
As the boat hummed from wharf to wharf a violet haze spread over the city. A 
mist of incense, coconuts, sweat, chili peppers and fish spilled from the stilt 
houses on the klongs that branched inland. The mist seeped from the floating 
city of sampans, the waterfront restaurants and the barbecue pit of the 
Oriental Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Bangkok all yours," said a schoolgirl pressed next to me on the fantail of the 
boat. She swept her open hand around the riverscape and smiled. An offer. 
</P>
<P>
"But where do I begin?" I asked, thinking of the dozens of stops the Express 
made and the countless ways a soul might enter into this city. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter," said the girl. "You always come back to the water." 
</P>
<P>
And the railway that twines among the banks, I added in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
Song Mai might have liked the image. Endless Oriental loops of life here.

Cotswolds

<P>
For those of you planning to visit England's Cotswolds country, we hear good 
things about a 17th-Century country hotel appropriately named the Cotswold 
House. One guest wrote that "crossing the threshold of the Cotswold House in 
Chipping Campden is like stepping into a cocoon of tranquillity." An American 
told proprietor Robert Greenstock: "Thank you for being faithful to your 
brochure." The hotel was recently restored. Polished oak, fresh flowers, 
original paintings, trompe l'oeil murals. Only 15 rooms with a brasserie that 
serves meals, snacks, drinks. No two guest rooms alike. "Behind the imposing 
doors of the Cotswold House is all that is best in hotel keeping," travelers 
are told. Only 90 miles from London. A recent recipient of a commendation from 
the British Tourist Authority.

Discount Booklet 
</P>
<P>
"How to Avoid the Phonies" is the theme of a booklet being distributed by the 
Worldwide Discount Travel Club of Florida. Warns not to give credit-card 
numbers over the telephone and to ask for detailed information. Provides 
answers to the most frequently asked questions concerning discount trips. Says 
it's necessary to read between the lines. Worldwide, with 6,000 members, has 
been offering trips since 1982. (Not a travel agency, nor does it compete with 
travel agents.) Worldwide is a clearinghouse that sells leftover space on 
cruise ships, airlines, tours. Operates for the person who is prepared to leave 
on short notice. Worldwide warns, though, that "some clubs take the customers' 
money and give nothing in return, ripping off unsuspecting travelers." 
Worldwide's booklet suggests precautions to avoid these unfortunate incidents.

BRENTWOOD HOUSE THEY CAN'T GIVE AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a house in Brentwood that its owners can't give away. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style home is owned by Debra and David Tenzer, a young couple who 
want a larger house but who don't want to move. They want to build a new home 
on the lot, not remodel the existing one. 
</P>
<P>
"And it occurred to us that we might try to donate the house to a nonprofit 
organization to use elsewhere," Debra Tenzer said, "because there are so many 
people with no place to live, so many people with no place to die." 
</P>
<P>
But so far, the Tenzers can't find any takers, although they've contacted many 
groups and are even willing to help pay for relocating the house. 
</P>
<P>
And time is running out. They plan to start building in late August or early 
September, "and it can take eight weeks to get the permits to move a house," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tenzers would like to preserve the home because "the idea of tearing down a 
house that stood here more than 60 years really bothers us," said David Tenzer, 
a talent agent. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,712-square-foot stucco house was built in 1926 by silent-screen cowboy 
star Tom Mix for a girlfriend, they say. It has three bedrooms, two baths, 
hand-carved and hand-painted ceilings, arched doorways, wood floors, a 
step-down living room, a front porch, a red-tile roof and two fireplaces with 
Malibu tile trim. 
</P>
<P>
There is also an adjacent building that the Tenzers would donate. It houses a 
two-car garage, a storeroom, a bedroom and a bath. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has been complaining about the tear-down fever," Tenzer said. "Well, 
here's one solution, but it's hard to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
They started hunting in March for a nonprofit group that would move the house 
to another site for its operations or activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I called many city organizations, especially for the homeless," Debra Tenzer, 
a homemaker, said, "and I tried AIDS Project Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
In all, she contacted 56 individuals -- 14 of them representing governmental 
entities, the rest from nonprofit groups, half religious, half related to 
health. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good response," she said, "but these people either didn't have a 
place to put the house or couldn't afford to move it, or both." 
</P>
<P>
Even if they could find a site, many mentioned to her that they didn't want to 
be bothered fighting neighborhood objections to a new facility for the homeless 
or other unfortunates that would be treated in the house. 
</P>
<P>
The Tenzers would sell to a private party, if they had no other choice, but 
they don't want to give the house to a nonprofit group to sell, without moving 
it, "because I wouldn't have control over the process," she explained. "How 
would I know it would be moved?" 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dunham, owner of a house-moving company called The House Relocater, said 
moving costs could be the biggest consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if a house is donated, it's not free, because there are a lot of other 
costs," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is the actual cost of moving the structure, and that can 
fluctuate, he said, depending on how far a house must be moved, how restrictive 
the ordinances involving the move are and how busy the movers are. 
</P>
<P>
Arnie Corlin, whose Tarzana firm concentrates on selling and relocating houses 
that otherwise would be razed by developers, said moves generally cost about 
$11 a square foot, but that it could be more, depending on such factors as 
whether there are two stories or the roof must be removed. 
</P>
<P>
As for other costs, Dunham mentioned fees for electrical and telephone wires. 
"And I just paid $3,100 for sewer accessibility," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacant Lots Scarce 
</P>
<P>
Besides offering to contribute a few thousand dollars toward the move, the 
Tenzers point out that there is money available to nonprofit organizations 
through the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency to move a house. 
However, the agency's Move-On Housing Program stipulates that the client must 
provide the lot as well as the building. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a vacant lot in Los Angeles isn't easy, according to Bill Jones, CRA 
director of rehabilitation, in a recent announcement about new funding for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing this problem, Debra Tenzer got an idea while driving past the 
Veterans Hospital in West Los Angeles. She heard that the Red Cross was about 
to open a facility on part of the hospital's land and wondered if her house 
could be moved there to be used by another nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
The group she had in mind is the Westside Children's Center, formed last 
November to recruit foster parents to take care of abused and neglected 
children under age 5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looking for Land' 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted our house very much for a day-care center," she said, but they 
have no land. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is growing so fast, we're constantly looking for land where we can 
put our new programs," said Gaylynn Thomas, director of the Santa Monica 
foster-family agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, I have to turn away children because there are not enough homes. We 
could have more if we could open a child-care center, because many who could 
become foster parents work and can't afford child care." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Spohr, a spokesman for the VA Hospital, confirmed that the Veterans 
Administration has "quite a bit of open space" on the 420-acre site, despite 
the more than 100 buildings already there but added, "The family who gave the 
land for the veterans' hospital said it could only be used for that and related 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Veterans' children might make the planned day-care center qualify, he conceded, 
"but that would all have to be worked out." The Tenzers are pursuing the idea, 
but so far, they've been frustrated in their efforts to get an answer from the 
VA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Have to Sell 
</P>
<P>
If they can't give it away, the Tenzers would sell the house to a buyer who 
would move it, but they don't know how much they would ask. The property was 
appraised for tax purposes at $765,000 in January, 1988, when they purchased 
it, but the land value was estimated at $612,600. 
</P>
<P>
They would prefer to donate the house, not because they would get some tax 
benefits, said David Tenzer, but because "if we can give it to someone to make 
use of, it would make us feel good. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be the greatest thing in the world to go to a hospice or a day-care 
center in six months and visit our house, but we're getting frustrated, as we 
have the time restraints." 
</P>
<P>
"If worse comes to worse," said his wife, "we know the Fire Department would 
like to train firefighters by tearing up the roof."

RIVAL CHALLENGES POSH MA MAISON HOTEL'S LIQUOR PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after shelling out more than $1 million to get neighbors to drop their 
opposition to his swank Westside hotel, developer Sheldon Gordon is back on the 
firing line. 
</P>
<P>
Only this time, his foe is rival hotelier Severyn Ashkenazy, and the solution 
may involve more than money alone. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest chapter of what some say is a feud that is several years old, 
lawyers for Ashkenazy, whose hotel group includes L'Ermitage in Beverly Hills, 
have challenged the right of the Ma Maison Sofitel, Gordon's 6-month-old hotel, 
to continue serving liquor unless it provides more parking for its patrons. 
</P>
<P>
An official in West Hollywood, whose city has done battle with both men in 
recent years over their hotel projects, said: "They're like two little kids 
fighting over a ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about competitors who are totally alienated from each other," 
said the official, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quality of Life 
</P>
<P>
Sounding more like an environmentalist than a lawyer for a competing hotelier, 
Ashkenazy attorney Tom Winfield last week asked a judge to order a review of 
whether the hotel's parking plan is sufficient "to protect the quality of life 
of the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
A decision by Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin is expected in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the talk about neighborhood preservation, none of the neighbors who 
once opposed the hotel out of concern for noise and traffic were in the 
courtroom. For that matter, they are no longer involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no interest in getting crushed between two hotel magnates. We had our 
day," said Harald Hahn, president of the Burton Way Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His group and two others made their peace with Gordon last year, promising to 
leave the hotel alone in exchange for Gordon writing a $250,000 check and 
agreeing to drop another $800,000 in a bank account -- controlled by Gordon and 
the homeowner groups -- to find more parking. 
</P>
<P>
But the accord did nothing to curb opposition from Ashkenazy, whose company has 
been operating under federal bankruptcy protection since 1986. His lawyers have 
continued to dog Gordon -- who also developed the Beverly Center -- in his 
efforts to put the hotel struggle behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, when even some of Gordon's former homeowner opponents appeared at 
the Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals and praised his plan to provide stack 
parking in the hotel's underground garage, Ashkenazy's lawyers were there to 
speak against it. 
</P>
<P>
The panel approved the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"(Gordon) has spent $1 million to cure a parking problem he claims doesn't 
exist, and we feel that, for the good of the entire community, (the granting of 
a liquor permit) shouldn't be allowed to just happen. That's why we're 
involved," said Winfield, following last week's court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gordon's lawyers offered a different view. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're seeing is the mischief of a disgruntled bankrupt hotelier who is 
trying to do everything he can to make life miserable for a competitor," lawyer 
Ronald J. Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
He says Ashkenazy's interest in Ma Maison is an attempt to force his client to 
buy an abandoned nightclub property Ashkenazy owns at 8511 Beverly Place, 
across the street from the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"He fought this hotel tooth and nail for years. And he has said that if Mr. 
Gordon would give him $5 million for the nightclub property, he'll go away," 
Silverman said. "I think that speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
The former nightclub, which faces the rear of the Ma Maison, is among the last 
vacant properties suitable for parking in the heavily congested commercial area 
near the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging that the hotel's being forced to provide additional 
parking would increase the value of the nightclub property, Winfield said: 
"That's not our prime consideration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parking Plan Urged 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in their right mind thinks the Ma Maison is not going be allowed to 
continue serving liquor. The only question is whether they're required to work 
out a legitimate parking plan in exchange for the privilege. . . . We think 
everyone benefits if they're made to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, meanwhile, is not taking the Ashkenazy challenge sitting down. The law 
firm that represents Gordon is, with Gordon's encouragement, representing a 
group of residents opposed to liquor licenses for a couple of posh West 
Hollywood hotels Ashkenazy manages. 
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by community activist Jeanne Dobrin, is asking the city of 
West Hollywood to deny conditional-use permits for the Valadon and Le Dufy. 
Ashkenazy needs the permits to obtain liquor licenses from the Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer who filed the appeals for the group in February is Michael Eidel, 
who also represents Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Eidel declined to say whether the community group was paying for his services, 
adding, "That's a confidential matter." 
</P>
<P>
Dobrin, however, said: "We don't have the money to go up against someone like 
Severyn Ashkenazy. . . . I just thank God there are people like Sheldon Gordon 
who can help us fight our battles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tasting Own Medicine 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the law firm's involvement in the Ashkenazy matter, Gordon said, 
"We thought we would give them a taste of their own medicine." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in business for 31 years and I think I've filed two lawsuits. I'm 
not the litigious sort. It never occurred to me to do anything like what he has 
done. He's used every tactic imaginable to minimize competition from us." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Ashkenazy said he was out of the country and could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
Dobrin said Eidel approached her several months ago "about helping us out" 
after another woman, whom she described as the "lead protestant" in the case, 
said she planned to move and asked to withdraw her name from the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy Enterprises last year reached an agreement with the city of West 
Hollywood allowing it to convert five apartment buildings -- including the 
Valadon and Le Dufy -- to hotels in exchange for a promise to pay $4.9 million 
over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Managing Hotels 
</P>
<P>
The financially troubled company, which also operates the Bel Age and Mondrian 
hotels in West Hollywood, sold the Valadon and Le Dufy to a couple of Illinois 
thrift institutions that were among its creditors after filing the bankruptcy 
petition in 1986. Ashkenazy has continued to manage them. 
</P>
<P>
In documents filed in Superior Court, lawyers for Gordon claim Ashkenazy has 
embarked on a "10-year crusade" to derail their client's efforts to develop Ma 
Maison, which opened last December across from the Beverly Center. 
</P>
<P>
After Gordon announced plans to develop the 10-story, 311-suite hotel in 1981, 
Ashkenazy unsuccessfully challenged a minor zoning variance that made it 
possible for the hotel to be built, saying the hotel would adversely affect the 
nightclub property, in which he owns half-interest. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when the city of West Hollywood sought an injunction to prevent the 
hotel from being built, on grounds it would have a negative impact on nearby 
residents of West Hollywood, Ashkenazy filed an almost identical action. 
</P>
<P>
Later, during the two-year struggle against the hotel by the neighborhood 
groups, Ashkenazy's lawyers were constant fixtures at a lengthy hearing before 
the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. 
</P>
<P>
"They were there through the entire administrative process as a sort of 
floating third party," Hahn recalled. "We got what we wanted, and I guess now 
maybe he (Ashkenazy) figures it's his turn."

EVEN NEW HOME BUYERS FEEL MARKET PRESSURE TO SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A week before escrow closed on our house in January, a man and a woman walked 
up to ask if it was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
I was shocked since the for sale sign had been taken down. I was standing 
outside with Milbre Burch, my wife, and Maria DiMassa, our real estate agent, 
both of whom had scoured the Pasadena and Altadena landscape to find this 
house. But DiMassa nodded and smiled, with an "I-told-you-this-was-a-desirable- 
street" look. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after we had moved, a woman interrupted our yard work and asked if we 
knew of any houses for sale. We said no. She was helping her son and 
daughter-in-law, she said, scout around. Then she asked if we wanted to sell. 
Again, we said no. 
</P>
<P>
Even with this level of interest in real estate, I still am amazed by the 
constant flow each week of letters, postcards and even potholders advertising 
the services of real estate agents. And we get knocks at the door, too. Fellow 
homeowners tell me I might expect pumpkins left by agents at Halloween and 
watermelons for July 4. This gives a new meaning to the concept of real estate 
farming, the practice of an agent pinpointing a neighborhood and consistently 
maintaining contact with the residents. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, this fevered approach can become infectious. And it represents 
quite a shift for Milbre and me, who still can freshly recall our days of 
wondering how nice a house we actually would be able afford. Now, presto!, even 
with an earthquake on Monday and the latest news that a seller's market was 
becoming more of a buyer's one, we are experiencing that feeling that the real 
estate ads refer to as "pride of ownership." 
</P>
<P>
This letter arrived last month from a Pasadena agent: "Your home may be well 
worth a lot more than you think . . . Just a few weeks ago, a house in your 
neighborhood sold for 25% more than the owners thought they could get." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors who have lived on Eldora Road a long time speak of feeling the 
pressure to sell. 
</P>
<P>
A letter we received reflects the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago -- the last time the market was this strong -- many homeowners 
were caught off guard. And they missed an ideal opportunity to sell because 
they didn't know how much their home was worth." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Mary Rico said she and her husband made their decision to sell based 
on the strength of the market on Eldora Road, where they've lived for 13 years, 
and market pressures in Sonora, near Yosemite, where they want to move. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several years she has frequently gotten knocks on the door from 
agents as well as house hunters. And she, too, gets solicitations from agents. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to wait two more years, but the real estate agents in Sonora said we 
must buy now because the prices are going up so fast there." And she said she 
and her husband can get four times what they paid for the house. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to move on," she said the other day. She put aside the garden hose 
she was using to water the grass outside her two-story, Mediterranean-style 
stucco house. A carpet of St. Augustine anchored a for sale sign. She explained 
that she and her husband, after bringing up four children in the house, are 
buying a retirement home in Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, another neighbor, who bought her house in the 1960s for 
$23,000, told me she accepted an offer for a free market analysis of her home's 
value. She was told she could ask $200,000. But she decided not to sell upon 
realizing she couldn't find a comparable house in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"It drives me nuts," another neighbor told me about the inundating 
solicitations. Yet she has also confessed she has thought about selling and 
trading up. 
</P>
<P>
But a neighbor, who came to the neighborhood 30 years ago and has long since 
retired, told me: "I don't know where I would go, if I did sell." 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, I spoke with another neighbor. From the vantage point of her 
front porch and from the perspective of being a resident for two decades, she 
provided a survey of the changing residential landscape. Newcomers there, she 
said, pointing to the sweet Spanish-style house with an arched loggia entrance 
and French windows. Newcomers over there, too, and of course you're new, she 
told me. Then, she said, there's the house down the street that sold last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after that conversation I got another letter which said: "Remember top 
dollar is being paid, regardless of condition, and of course, a lovely home 
like yours may receive multiple offers." The letter came with a potholder 
emblazoned with the agent's name and phone number. 
</P>
<P>
All this frenzy of buying, selling and moving feels disconcerting. I grew up in 
the Mississippi hometown of my great-grandparents, my grandparents and parents. 
Until three years ago, my mother had lived in the same house for 50 years. My 
wife grew up in the Atlanta house where her parents have lived for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the 15 years since I left graduate school, I have lived at 17 addresses 
and, like my wife, have lived in four states during that time. 
</P>
<P>
This appears to be appropriate training for what Milbre calls the mobility 
giddiness of Southern California where some people seem to buy a house as often 
as they trade in a car. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, though, we want to stay put. But occasionally the giddiness sweeps 
in the prospect of a better house, a better neighborhood. Or even the notion 
that, as one real estate agent's letter said: "You, too, may be missing out on 
the hidden value of your home if you don't at least find out its current worth. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
One day, but not any time too soon, we will find out.

CURIOUS 'EYESORE,' ONCE SITE OF WAVE LAB, WILL BE RAZED

Kathy Garcia always wondered about the huge, partially dilapidated hangar in 
front of her home. She considered trespassing to see what the battered walls 
barely concealed, but never worked up the nerve. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Garcia and her inquisitive neighbors should have their curiosity 
satisfied. Workers are scheduled to begin demolition of the structure, a 
Caltech laboratory containing a 3,000-gallon pool once used for ground-breaking 
wave experiments. 
</P>
<P>
Since late last year the city has been pressuring the university to raze the 
structure or meet building standards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of an eyesore," Garcia said. "I guess everybody's been curious about 
it. But I don't think it will be missed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valuable Data 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1940s, the wave pool provided valuable data on the building of 
harbors. Twenty years later, the pool and a companion wave simulation tank were 
used to study proposed nuclear reactors along the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Work continued into the mid-1980s, when research was moved to a smaller 
facility on the Caltech campus. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech Prof. Fredric Raichlen said the lab, which has only been used for 
storage in recent years, was not worth the trouble or cost to repair. Caltech 
officials said it will cost about $75,000 to raze the building or $700,000 to 
repair it, said David E. Rudisel, the city's community improvement manager. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisel said the building, located behind Zacatecas Park on Virginia Avenue, 
lacks adequate landscaping, sidewalks or a paved parking lot and needs various 
other exterior improvements. It has become a depository for the university's 
odds and ends, including discarded experiments and equipment and rock core 
samples from geologic surveys in Greenland, Rudisel said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are problems with vandals, thieves and children breaking into 
the unsecured building, the city acted as part of a get-tough policy on 
building code violators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land-Use Problem 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply a land-use problem. Either they had to bring it up to snuff or get 
rid of it," Rudisel said. 
</P>
<P>
The hangar, which Raichlen conservatively estimates to be 20,000 square feet or 
more, was donated by the U.S. Navy for experiments by Caltech's Robert Knapp 
and Vito A. Vanoni near the end of World War II. The prefabricated 
corrugated-metal-and-glass structure resembles a large Quonset hut. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp and Vanoni were commissioned to design a breakwater to shield Apra Harbor 
in Guam from the Pacific's often-turbulent waters. 
</P>
<P>
In such wave studies, bigger is generally better for getting realistic data 
from a model wave pool, said Raichlen, a civil engineer specializing in 
hydraulics. The original wave pool was 132 feet long, 88 feet wide and 2 feet 
deep, and had a molded bottom to represent the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
"If you generate waves in the laboratory, then you can see how they go into a 
harbor and cause problems," he said. "It's somewhat unique. I think this was 
probably one of the largest wave tanks at the time it was built." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Land on Campus 
</P>
<P>
Raichlen guessed that the 11-acre site in Azusa was selected because of the 
lack of available land on campus and the price of property in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
When active, engineers would crank up wave machines at one side of the pool to 
view the effect on the miniature harbor and coastline on the opposite side. 
Water could be extracted and then forced violently back to create storms and 
typhoons. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most harbor studies are conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at 
a lab in Virginia, Raichlen said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Vanoni and Raichlen conducted a similar studies for a nuclear reactor 
off Bolsa Chica State Beach in Orange County. That research was aimed at a 
combination power and water desalination plant proposed for the coast by the 
Metropolitan Water District that would provide electricity and freshwater. 
</P>
<P>
"This was before the problems of environmental concerns," he recalled. "You had 
a good source of saltwater and a good source of electricity." 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned, the plant was to be located on a man-made "Bolsa Island" just 
off the coast. Raichlen and Vanoni built a 9-by-7-foot island in the middle of 
the pool for the miniature breakers to batter. 
</P>
<P>
The project later died amid escalating costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studied Power Plant 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Raichlen and Vanoni studied a proposed coastal power plant in 
Mendocino County. That project, for Northern California's Pacific Gas &amp; 
Electric Co., was killed by the utility primarily because of environmental 
concerns posed by earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
For the later studies, a smaller wave tank was added to create miniature 
breakers. The tank was 120 feet long, and 3 feet deep and wide. It has since 
been dismantled and stored, Raichlen said. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of big research projects and the hangar's distance from campus 
eventually led to the wave lab's decline, Raichlen said. As the years went by, 
the number of break-ins and vandalism increased, Raichlen said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech continues to do wave research in a smaller tank on campus. "If this 
site was on campus we would have not stopped using it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Raichlen said the lab provided many valuable discoveries concerning wave 
diffraction, the manner in which waves break up upon encountering barriers. 
</P>
<P>
University spokesman Hall P. Daily said Caltech has no immediate plans for the 
site but wants to hold onto the land.

Photo, Now abandoned and dilapidated, Caltech lab for wave studies in Azusa has 
a long history. From the late '40s into the mid-'80s, scientists used simulated 
waves to design harbors and study feasibility of offshore or coastal power 
plants. The 3,000-gallon pool had a molded bottom to represent the uneven ocean 
floor. Waves generated at the far end of the pool allowed observers to gauge 
the effect of breakers on harbor or offshore facilities. LOU MACK / Los Angeles

MONROVIA WILL SPEND $8.5 MILLION TO IMPROVE BLIGHTED NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

MONROVIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ambitious program that will offer residents home improvement grants and 
services such as free garbage collection will be implemented in southeast 
Monrovia this fall in an effort to make the area more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bob Bartlett and Councilwoman Lara Blakely are about to begin 
interviewing candidates for an advisory committee that will guide the 
$8.5-million residential rehabilitation effort. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council last month approved the five-year plan, dubbed the 
"Comprehensive Neighborhood Housing Services Program," to boost private 
development in the area bordered by Olive, Shamrock, Cherry and Ivy avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Nine areas totaling about 15 acres within those boundaries have been targeted 
for special services, according to Steve Cervantes, Monrovia building-housing 
division manager. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal, he said, will be the creation of a nonprofit community 
organization to continue improvement of the neighborhood once the city pulls 
out. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope that the cleanup will attract investors to build houses or 
repair run-down properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Few are willing to invest after they see the conditions in the neighborhood," 
Cervantes said. "A typical developer would like to find one or two run-down 
properties in a very nice neighborhood. Here, we have a lot of run-down 
properties." 
</P>
<P>
Although some residents were skeptical about how workable the project will be, 
most welcomed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds good," said Mando Delamadrid, who wants to replace the peeling paint on 
his 70-year-old single-family home on California Avenue with stucco but who has 
been unable to save the $3,000 it would cost. The program would "make the 
neighborhood feel better, improve the value of our house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will include traditional low-interest loans for home rehabilitation 
the city has offered eligible homeowners for 12 years. In addition, it will 
provide for tighter code enforcement, free dumpster service and grants of up to 
$5,000 for exterior improvements such as painting or landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The city also hopes to establish a program under which residents can borrow 
tools and get free labor. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to buy land for small residential developments. Although eminent 
domain can be used to obtain parcels for building low- and moderate-income 
housing in the area, the city does not intend to force anyone to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we're trying a totally comprehensive approach," said 
Cervantes, who has been working on the plan for the last year. "It's not just 
bricks and mortar but economic development and job training. I'm looking 
forward to getting neighbors involved in this." 
</P>
<P>
William Dillard, pastor of the 2nd Baptist Church on Shamrock Avenue, said most 
of the 700 families in his congregation would jump at the chance to increase 
the value of their properties. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is to explain the opportunity to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaders Will Be Recruited 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said community meetings will be held to recruit neighborhood leaders 
from each of the nine target areas to encourage resident participation and 
outline what is available. The city might require some contractors to recruit 
and train neighborhood youth for jobs such as painting or construction, 
Cervantes said. Such skills could perhaps be used to obtain jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ozvie Wilson, pastor of the 20-member Antioch Church of Christ Holiness on the 
corner of Canyon Boulevard and Walnut Avenue, lauded the plan. "It's amazing to 
see so many unemployed black young people, and yet I know they're qualified to 
do jobs," he said. He has been putting off painting the church, dating from 
1947, because he hasn't had the money. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said priorities and spending will be directed by the advisory 
committee. He recommends as members himself, the mayor, developers and 
representatives from the community, the Monrovia Unified School District, the 
NAACP, and job training and child care programs. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council must approve the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be paid for mainly through federal Community Development Block 
Grant funds and Monrovia Redevelopment Agency money, Cervantes said. Donations 
from businesses and developers will also be solicited. 
</P>
<P>
The largest sum, $2.3 million, will be allocated for the first year. The city 
expects to spend $2 million in the second year and $1.4 million in each of the 
next three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not First Effort 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first stab the city has taken at upgrading the area. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the city designated a larger zone bordered by Foothill Boulevard 
and Myrtle, Shamrock and Central avenues as a Neighborhood Strategy Area 
because of its largely substandard housing. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that an infusion of city funds into the community would boost private 
investment, the Redevelopment Agency pumped $10 million into the 10-acre Canyon 
Park Townhomes project in the center of the 200-acre strategy area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 96-unit complex was completed in 1983, it has not attracted a 
significant number of private housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
In a February report, Cervantes said developers have been reluctant to venture 
into a neighborhood with drug activity that has spurred the Police Department 
to double patrols in the last three years. Because of the stepped-up police 
presence and housing code enforcement by the city, he said, there is no longer 
visible drug activity on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
As an incentive for developers, the city will consider waiving all building 
permit and related fees, which cost about $5,000 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
Owner apathy and an inability of some residents to qualify for city loans has 
been another obstacle, Cervantes said. Although interest rates as low as 3% are 
available for some home improvements, only about $100,000 in loans are made 
each year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Deferred 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, "we could defer repayment until they sell the house," 
Cervantes said about those who can't afford loans. A family of four must have 
an annual income of less than $30,400 to qualify for a loan, and less than 
$19,950 to qualify for a grant. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine target areas, more than 60% of the households are moderate- to 
low-income, and 75% of the homes need some rehabilitation, he said. The plan 
recommends eight homes for demolition because of their condition. 
</P>
<P>
One Canyon Park Townhomes resident who declined to be named wondered whether 
homeowners would take the city up on the new offers. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had programs in the past," the former board member of the town home 
homeowners association said. 
</P>
<P>
She bought her town home six years ago because she expected the surrounding 
area would be developed sooner. "After six years I'm too frustrated to wait," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone took the time to make their house look better, the pride in 
ownership would be different," she said. "Our neighbors across the street flip 
up the trunk of a car and blare the radio. There are lawns that aren't green, 
that aren't mowed, that are overgrown. Those are things that are not 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Sivy Farhi, vice president of the Canyon Park Townhomes homeowners association, 
said the plan is "a marvelous idea." 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners in the development are unhappy with the neighborhood, he said. 
One homeowner lost a potential buyer after the buyer talked with police about 
crime in the area, Farhi said. Another family moved because they decided it 
wasn't a good place to raise children, and some in the development want nearby 
homes to be razed, he said.

LA WEEKLY FOUNDERS WIN SINCLAIR AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Liberty Hill Foundation will present its seventh annual Upton Sinclair 
award to the founders of LA Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
Joie Davidow, Jay Levin, Ginger Varney and Michael Ventura, journalists who 
started the weekly newspaper a decade ago, will be honored June 21 at a dinner 
at the Beverly Hilton hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberty Hill Foundation is a charitable organization based in Santa Monica 
that gives seed-money grants to community and social action groups. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is named for the spot near the harbor in San Pedro where 
muckraker and social activist Upton Sinclair was arrested in 1923 after reading 
the U.S. Constitution aloud to striking longshoremen. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Upton Sinclair award dinner is the foundation's principal 
fund-raising event. Past recipients of the award include performers Mike 
Farrell, Ed Asner, Harry Belafonte and Edward James Olmos and director Martin 
Ritt. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation Director Michele Prichard said LA Weekly was being honored for its 
coverage of the environment and other issues of social concern, and for taking 
an active role in the community. Jim Becker, head of the foundation board, 
praised the paper for being more than a compendium of advertisements and coming 
events and "really going out on a limb to make a statement." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the event are $175.

Stephanie Knapik, assistant director of the Westside Fair Housing Council, has 
been named executive director of the nonprofit group.

Tired of watching others attempt to rework his musicals for the screen, 
composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has decided to produce the film version of his 
current L.A. stage smash, "The Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Webber has hired Joel Schumacher ("Cousins," "Lost Boys") to direct and 
actors Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman (Mrs. Lloyd Webber in real life) to 
reprise the roles of the Phantom and Christine, which they originated in the 
London and Broadway productions. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher told us the project's embryonic, but could go before the cameras as 
early as next spring, when Crawford completes his contract with the L.A. 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea," said Schumacher, "is to have a fully realized package, which can 
(then) be shopped to the studios." Leonard Klady

Spike Lee and Arsenio Hall at odds? Not at all, Hall insists. 
</P>
<P>
There's been conjecture that Lee might never get on "The Arsenio Hall Show" 
after the film maker's critical barbs about Hall's buddy, Eddie Murphy, that 
appeared in Calendar last April. But Hall has booked Lee to appear on his 
late-night chat show June 27 to promote Lee's "Do the Right Thing," which opens 
in 350 theaters on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had people come up to me and say, 'I guess Spike isn't going to be on 
your show now' -- making assumptions that are not true," Hall said. Hall said 
he hasn't read Lee's comments -- Lee accused Murphy of failing to do his share 
to help other blacks in the film industry -- and that there's no bad blood 
between them. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's closer to me than Ed," added Hall, "and he's never said a negative 
thing about the man. When we talk about young black film makers, it's Spike's 
work we respect, because he's got (courage)." Stacy Jenel Smith

Sly Stallone has a prison pic, "Lock-Up," due in August from Tri-Star. But he's 
not exactly Rambo-ish about taking on the summer competition. "Have you ever 
seen so much hype? Definitely scary," Sly admits. "I figure I should stay low 
profile. I'm purposely not going to be doing any sky writing." 
</P>
<P>
The $24-million film, directed by John Flynn ("Best Seller") and shot largely 
at New Jersey's Rahway State Prison, is now being rushed through 
postproduction. ("We cut the film in just 12 days.") He calls it "the closest 
thing I've done to 'Rocky,' in that it's really an ensemble piece. My character 
is reliant on a lot of other people -- a support system." Pat H. Broeske

Meanwhile, he's at work on the tentatively titled "Set-Up," which just began 
filming for Warners. The Guber-Peters production, with Andre Konchalovsky 
directing, co-stars Sly and Kurt Russell as two cops who are set up and 
imprisoned, then break out and go after the villains. "But this isn't a prison 
movie like 'Lock-Up.' The prison scenes take up only about four pages (of the 
script)." 
</P>
<P>
 He insists the back-to-back pics are not a comeback: "Oh, c'mon! 'Rambo III' 
may have gotten scathing reviews, but it came in 11th at the (1988) box office 
(gross: $53 million). And it did some good foreign box office. This is just 
another cycle of my career.

Fourteen conductors will occupy the music director-less podium of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic during the 1989-90 season being announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them -- former music director Andre Previn, current principal guest 
conductor Simon Rattle, Erich Leinsdorf, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Kurt Sanderling and 
Vladimir Ashkenazy -- are familiar faces and known quantities. Others -- 
Gennady Rozhdestvensky, David Zinman and Andrew Litton, for example -- are less 
well known to us. 
</P>
<P>
And three of them will be making L.A. Philharmonic debuts in a season when 
every new podium personality will be scrutinized as a candidate to replace 
Previn. 
</P>
<P>
Marek Janowski, 50, is the Polish musician who has earned acclaim for his 
"Ring" cycle on CD and has already conducted at major American opera centers. 
He made a successful first appearance with the Boston Symphony in February. 
Janowski is chief conductor of the Orchestre Philharmonique de France and the 
Gurzenich Orchester of Cologne, West Germany. His one-week Philharmonic visit 
takes place April 6-8, when he leads a program of music by Wagner ("Tannhauser" 
Overture), Chopin (E-minor Piano Concerto, with Horacio Gutierrez) and Schumann 
("Rhenish" Symphony). 
</P>
<P>
A native of Prague, Libor Pesek, 56, is principal conductor and artistic 
adviser of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and conductor-in-residence of the 
Czech Philharmonic. He leads the Los Angeles orchestra in what reads like an 
invigorating Mozart/Richard Strauss program, Feb. 15-18: Symphony No. 32, Piano 
Concerto in A, K. 488 (with Emanuel Ax the soloist); the "Burleske", and "Also 
sprach Zarathustra." A protege of Karel Ancerl and Vaclav Neumann, Pesek is an 
experienced opera conductor who has made more than 50 commercial recordings. 
</P>
<P>
The West German conductor, Bruno Weil, 40, is general music director of the 
city of Augsburg. In 1989, he completes a three-year, three-opera Mozart cycle 
at the Vienna Volksoper. For his engagement at the L.A. Philharmonic, Dec. 
14-17, Weil will lead a Mozart program consisting of the "Don Giovanni" 
Overture, the Piano Concerto in E-flat, K. 271 (with Olli Mustonen) and the 
Symphony No. 36 ("Linz"). 
</P>
<P>
In this varied season, two conductors will carry the bulk of the programs: 
Previn, who resigned as Philharmonic music director April 25, will be on the 
podium for seven weeks; and Sanderling will occupy the position for five weeks. 
Visiting here for two weeks apiece will be Leinsdorf, Rattle and Litton. The 
other conductors, including Philharmonic assistants David Alan Miller and 
Heiichiro Ohyama, will all preside for one week apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's Music Center season opens Oct. 5 and closes April 29. 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSERS: The world premiere of "Holy Blood and Crescent Moon" by Stewart 
Copeland, former drummer of the rock group the Police, will be given by Opera 
Cleveland in October. . . . Gordon Getty's Falstaff opera, "Plump Jack," heard 
in a concert-version preview here by L.A. Music Center Opera in 1988, will 
receive its world premiere performance at the Festival of Two Worlds in 
Spoleto, Italy, on July 4. Welsh baritone David Barrell will sing the title 
role; among the other principals will be William Lewis, Korby Merrick, Jerold 
Siena and Frank Curtis. . . . New residencies for composers in Boston, San 
Francisco and Portland have been announced by the National Endowment for the 
Arts. Anthony Davis will work for seven weeks with Boston Musica Viva; composer 
and jazz violinist Leroy Jenkins will have a six-week residency with Virtuosi 
della Rosa in Oregon, and Harvey Sollberger will work with the San Francisco 
Contemporary Music Players for one season. . . . James Hopkins of the 
composition faculty at the USC school of music has been honored as first-prize 
winner of the composition contest sponsored by the Los Angeles chapter of the 
American Guild of Organists. The $1,000 prize was presented last week; the new 
work will be heard during the AGO's 1989-90 season. . . . Jan Hanus' 
"Glagolitic" Mass, a work introduced in the United States by the chancel choir 
of Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church in 1986, will be repeated in a performance 
by the Choral Society of Southern California, assisted by the chancel choir, 
next Sunday at 4 p.m. at the church at 505 N. Rodeo Drive. Nick Strimple will 
conduct; the vocal soloists will be Barbara Hancock, Susan Johnson, Michael 
Sells and Michael Samford. 
</P>
<P>
BRIEFLY: A third summer season of chamber music in La Jolla, Summerfest '89 
will take place in the beach community, Aug. 18-27. Among the participants will 
be pianists Andre Previn, Jeffrey Kahane and David Golub, violinists Cho-Liang 
Lin, Andres Cardenes, Julie Rosenfeld and Eugene Drucker; violist Heiichiro 
Ohyama (also artistic director of the festival); cellists Peter Rejto, Gary 
Hoffman, Diane Chaplin and Ralph Kirshbaum; clarinetist David Peck; oboist 
Gerard Reuter, and hornist Richard Todd. . . . Benjamin Luxon will sing the 
title role in Verdi's "Falstaff" with L.A. Music Center Opera, in February, 
1990, replacing the originally announced Swedish baritone Ingvar Wixell, who, 
according to a spokesman for the company, was "unable to meet his contractual 
commitment for the full rehearsal period." . . . Arnold Jacobs, Stephen Burns, 
Eric Aubier and Arturo Sandoval are among the soloists on the roster of the 
International Trumpet Guild Conference 1989, being planned at UC Santa Barbara, 
Aug. 10-13. Write: ITG Conference, P.O. Box 13820, Santa Barbara 93107. . . . 
John Gage, formerly general manager of the Milwaukee Florentine Opera, has been 
named general director of Opera Columbus in Ohio, succeeding Michael Harrison, 
who took over at Baltimore Opera earlier this year.

ON THE RECORD: RICHARD THE SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Strauss was a target almost from the start of his career in the 1880s, 
with the Brahmsians reviling him as Richard the Second, i.e., Wagner, his idol. 
</P>
<P>
After the turn of the century, the Establishment took up the cudgels in 
response to the screechings and eroticism of his operas "Salome" and "Elektra." 
Whereupon he was lambasted by the modernists for turning his back on dissonance 
in favor of Johann Strauss as well as the Classical era in his "Der 
Rosenkavalier," whose success, another clique contended, he vainly tried to 
repeat in subsequent, sound-alike operas. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever insults Strauss had to suffer, he kept being performed. His 
orchestral works have never been in disfavor among conductors or audiences for 
they are, above all, fabulous, voluptuous showpieces. 
</P>
<P>
It is doubtful that the 16-year-old's String Quartet in A raised many hackles. 
Strauss wrote a string quartet? Well, it could be said that he didn't, that it 
was actually a collaborative effort by Beethoven, Schubert and Mendelssohn. 
Should prove a boggler at guess-the-composer sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The piece surfaces via London's Delme Quartet, which knocks it off with 
ruder-than-necessary vigor; ditto their treatment of the considerably superior 
(and likewise sole) String Quartet by Verdi (Hyperion 66317). 
</P>
<P>
Schumann's ghost inhabits the Sonata in E-flat for Violin and Piano, dating 
from 1887, when Strauss was 23. But there is Straussian melos as well in this 
overheated beauty, with its foretastes of "Don Juan" and "Heldenleben," even 
the closing pages of "Ariadne auf Naxos." 
</P>
<P>
The elegant, restrained performance (on Philips 420 944) is by Pinchas Zukerman 
and Marc Neikrug, who actually bolster Strauss' cause with a sizable cut in the 
overlong finale. In the accompanying Sonata in D of Prokofiev, however, the 
duo's slow tempos and air of detachment rob the score of its inherent vitality. 
</P>
<P>
The tone poems "Don Juan," "Till Eulenspiegel" and "Death and Transfiguration" 
are presented with becoming swagger and virtuosity by the Cleveland Orchestra 
under Lorin Maazel on a mid-priced CBS reissue (44904). But the subtleties and 
lyric effusions of "Don Quixote," arguably the finest of the tone poems, are 
shortchanged in the sluggish reading by Neeme Jarvi with the Scottish National 
Orchestra (Chandos 86310). Under the circumstances, the sensitive solo cello of 
Raphael Wallfisch counts for little. 
</P>
<P>
The disc also offers a pretty, Schumannesque bit of Strauss juvenilia, the 1883 
Romanze for cello. In addition, there are two songs: the noble, hugely 
impressive "Song of the Priestesses of Apollo" (1896), originally with 
orchestra, foreshadowing the final scene of "Salome," and the familiar "Ruhe 
meine Seele" of 1894 for which the composer provided the ill-fitting 
orchestration heard here a half-century later. Both require a heftier voice 
than Felicity Lott's bright soprano, but her expressive delivery carries the 
day in the "Song of the Priestesses." 
</P>
<P>
Another curiosity -- because of the music's familiarity -- is "Ein Heldenleben" 
(1898) in its perversely well-mannered, small-scale treatment by Andre Previn, 
who conducts the Vienna Philharmonic (Telarc 80180). Never has Strauss' lusty 
alter-ego/hero seemed so self-effacing, even insipid. 
</P>
<P>
More troublesome still is the accompanying work, the octogenarian composer's 
Four Last Songs, where Previn's underemphatic baton fails to provide a context 
in which soprano Arleen Auger can float Strauss' glorious fancies. 
</P>
<P>
Another prized work from the composer's last days is the "Metamorphosen" for 
strings, in which he looks back with equal affection to Schoenberg's "Verklarte 
Nacht" and his own "Rosenkavalier." It is logically coupled (on Nimbus 5151) 
with Schoenberg's moonstruck piece, both being handsomely executed by the 
English String Orchestra under William Boughton's unobtrusively firm, loving 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Good news, too, from the little British ASV label which couples (on CD 809) the 
splendid "Bourgeois Gentilhomme" Suite and the charming, if somewhat dated (in 
its tinkly neo-Baroqueries) Dance Suite after Couperin, both delivered with 
terrific snap, precision and warmth by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe under 
Erich Leinsdorf, a conductor shamefully underemployed by the recording 
companies these days.

The Sandmen. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel: Allan Vegenfeldt, vocals; Stefan Jensen, guitar, Ole Wennike, bass 
and harmonica; Michael Rasmussen, drums; Sam Mitchell, guitar. 
</P>
<P>
History: Vegenfeldt, Jensen, Wennike and Rasmussen met through the 
punk-oriented Copenhagen, Denmark, club scene three years ago, sharing a 
disdain for Danish pop music and a love for such Anglo or American acts as the 
Rolling Stones, Lou Reed and the Sex Pistols. Performing only in English, the 
band built a following on the Danish club circuit, drawing the attention of 
Swedish label owner Peter Yngen, who started a new Danish company, Garden 
Records, and signed the band. An EP was released in 1987, followed by an album, 
"Western Blood," in 1988. By this time, Mitchell, an Englishman whose credits 
included a stint with Rod Stewart, had become a full member after being called 
to help with some guitar overdubs. Yngen recommended the Sandmen to Aaron 
Jacoves, a Los Angeles-based talent scout for A&amp;M Records, who flew to 
Copenhagen and signed the band. Four new songs were recorded then for the 
American version of "Western Blood," released in February. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: On first listen you'd most likely assume the Sandmen hail from somewhere 
like Ohio or Arizona rather than Copenhagen. Second listen too. And third, 
fourth, fifth and last. Not only is the music more in line with Boston's 
neo-blues Treat Her Right than with such Scandinavian posters as Abba, A-Ha or 
even Iceland's bold Sugarcubes, but there's nary a hint of national origin, not 
even a touch of accent in Vegenfeldt's sturdy singing. That aside, the Sandmen 
have forged a solid and varied take on American rock styles.

POP EYE: RAPPERS WELCOME MTV'S ENTHUSIASM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MTV's decision to expand its afternoon "Yo! MTV Raps" show from a half-hour to 
an hour and to rerun it the following morning has been greeted with a hearty 
"yo!" by members of the rap community. 
</P>
<P>
That adds up to 12 hours of rap programming each week, a quantum leap from the 
30 minutes MTV devoted to rap as recently as last September. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Masters, MTV's executive vice president and general manager, said that rap 
has been one of the three biggest phenomena to hit the channel in its eight 
years of existence, along with new wave and heavy metal/hard rock. He added 
that "Yo! MTV Raps" consistently vies with the loopy game show "Remote Control" 
as MTV's top-rated daily program. 
</P>
<P>
Masters acknowledged that the channel initially approached rap "gingerly," but 
said that rap has proved to be as well-accepted by the MTV audience as metal. 
</P>
<P>
"And I would also say that it is as widely disliked as metal," he added. "They 
each have a contingent that's fanatical and another that really hates it and we 
try to balance the two." 
</P>
<P>
Masters added that a "Yo! MTV Raps" theatrical film is in development for late 
fall release, featuring performances and backstage interplay from a host of top 
rap stars. Among the acts expected to appear in the film, in which Universal 
appears to have the inside track: LL Cool J, Tone Loc and D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; 
the Fresh Prince. 
</P>
<P>
MTV's enthusiasm for rapper Tone Loc is credited with helping his "Loc-Ed After 
Dark" album become the first rap release to generate back-to-back Top 10 pop 
hits, "Wild Thing" and "Funky Cold Medina." 
</P>
<P>
"MTV made Tone Loc," said Russell Simmons, president of Rush Artists Management 
in New York. "They're a lot more progressive than pop radio." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, whose company represents such rappers as LL Cool J and Slick Rick, 
noted that before MTV began playing rap so aggressively, rap records would 
often stall after fast starts. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd get to about 700,000 units and then hit this brick wall," he said. "The 
last EPMD album went gold and went to No. 1 on the black album chart, but 60 
days later it was dead. Our new EPMD album is going to sell a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Adler, Rush Artists' director of publicity, added: "The effect of 'Yo! MTV 
Raps' has been astonishing. MTV is opening radio's ears, and radio is following 
their lead. Kids have gotten a whiff of rap on MTV, and now they've begun to 
demand it." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ross, president of Delicious Vinyl Records, the Los Angeles-based 
company that broke Tone Loc, agreed that MTV was instrumental in Loc's success. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Wild Thing' was starting to break big out here in L.A. and then MTV started 
banging the video and the record really caught on nationally," he said. "It was 
just about ready to explode and MTV helped explode it." 
</P>
<P>
Ross added that MTV's embrace of Loc "opened the minds of a lot of people in 
middle America -- young white kids who weren't into rap before. . . . It's all 
what's happening in the streets. Rap records are selling. And once they become 
a major commodity in the marketplace, forces like MTV take it very seriously. 
And why not? It's making them money."

SIRI LANKA CURRY HOUSE: TASTEFUL TOUCH, RARE CUISINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 10 years ago, there was a Sri Lankan restaurant in Encino, right across 
the street from a Burger King, and it was one spunky little place. Unknown as 
its cuisine was in Encino, it boldly answered the Home of the Whopper with a 
sign declaring itself to be the "Home of the Hopper." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that not enough people knew that a hopper is a Sri Lankan 
delicacy, a delicate crepe made from coconut and rice meal. Encinans didn't get 
the joke, and they didn't eat anywhere near enough hoppers. Pretty soon the 
Home of the Hopper disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
It was a shame, because Sri Lankan food is very attractive, rather like Indian 
food, though not as similar as Sri Lanka's location off the southern tip of 
India might lead you might expect. Often, with its coconut sauces and 
non-chutney side dishes, it seems a first cousin to Indonesian food. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a rare cuisine; there are only three Sri Lankan restaurants in the 
entire country, according to the owners of one in Hollywood that is buried in a 
corner of a mini-mall and insists on making it hard for people to get its 
number from Information by spelling "Sri" as two syllables ("Siri"). 
</P>
<P>
Don't let that stop you. This is a very interesting restaurant indeed, starting 
with the papadums. As at many an Indian restaurant, they bring out these 
paper-thin chickpea nachos before you order, accompanied by a hot and a sweet 
chile sauce, and also an unusual apple chutney. It's chunks of stewed apple 
mixed with what tastes remarkably like American barbecue sauce. The restaurant 
even sells the sauce by the pint for barbecue purposes. 
</P>
<P>
These sauces, chutneys or whatever you wish to call them, are also handy if you 
order any of the knickknacks (Sri Lankans do not actually eat an appetizer 
course, but the restaurant offers some Sri Lankan snacks, under not 
particularly helpful names; e.g., "patties" are samosas). I'm thinking of the 
vades, "vegeburgers" made from yellow lentils, green chiles and onions; by 
themselves they're a little dry, served with nothing but a condiment of fried 
coconut. 
</P>
<P>
The main part of the menu is a list of nine curries, including squid curry and 
even chicken giblet curry. They're all prepared differently. The crab curry, 
for instance, is in a tart coconut sauce said to have some ground rice in it -- 
it's a great sauce, and makes up for the fact that there's not much to the crab 
that's served in it. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the curries go into a Sri Lankan specialty called lampries. This word, 
pronounced "lump rice," has nothing to do with the eel-like fish called 
lamprey, excessive eating of which is said to have killed Henry I of England. 
Like the Indonesian rijsttafel, it's a Dutch word (lomprijst) and in a way it's 
the equivalent of that Indonesian feast. 
</P>
<P>
But whereas rijsttafel is rice plus a lot of side dishes, lampries consists of 
rice, lamb, chicken, beef and pork curries, and several other things mixed 
together and steamed in a banana leaf. Eating lampries is not the best way to 
learn the difference between the different curries, of course, but you can 
distinguish the lamb (tamarind flavor, gamy lamb aroma), the beef (coconut and 
garlic) and the pork (ginger, tomato) from the chicken (just sort of curried). 
</P>
<P>
Mixed in with the curries are likely to be a sweet eggplant condiment (I could 
make a meal of it alone), a similar condiment called seenisambola made from 
onions fried dark brown and cooked with tamarind and sugar, and a couple of 
other things like toasted shredded coconut and cashews. Lampries needs to be 
advance-ordered, with about an hour's notice. 
</P>
<P>
There are a dozen other entrees ranging from a curious dish called "roasted 
curried chicken" to a fish marinated in lemon and saffron and served in a 
surprisingly spicy sauce with a generous chicken pilaf on the side. The chicken 
has the waxy texture of duck and is not particularly spicy, but it comes with a 
coconut sauce, a vegetable pilaf and the usual accompaniments of sweet eggplant 
and cucumber and onion in yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the curry list there are several vegetable dishes, a list of 
specialties including mallung (shredded vegetables fried with mustard, garlic 
and coconut; you sprinkle it on other dishes for a tart flavor) and of course 
hoppers, which you can get with any curry. Even better than plain hoppers 
(called appe on the menu) are the curiously named string hoppers, little 
patties of steamed vermicelli made from rice and coconut. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are a strange handful. Vatalappan is a Sri Lankan cousin of 
coconut flan, but with a rather flabby texture, and there are some very strange 
cakes: rich cake, which tastes like fruitcake, and love cake, which tastes like 
compacted coconut. The best dessert by far is ice cream with a generous 
sprinkling of "cashew nugget," which turns out to be like the French almond 
candy praline, only made from cashews. 
</P>
<P>
I know Siri Lanka Curry House hasn't asked my advice, but I think they should 
have a sign reading: Home of the Lampries, the Cashew Nugget and the String 
Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested dishes: vegetable patties, $1.60; string hoppers with meat curry, $5; 
lampries, $11; ice cream with cashew nugget, $1.50. 
</P>
<P>

WHODUNIT ACTOR WITH A PENCHANT FOR DOING IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't even try to pigeonhole Randy Stone. 
</P>
<P>
He was a child actor. A production assistant at 17, a casting apprentice at 18. 
Head of casting for Alan Landsburg Productions -- and running his own company 
-- at 21. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't want to have to be a casting director my whole life," said Stone, 
30. "I write music, sing music. I have an antique emporium. I buy and sell 
antiques. I buy houses, fix them up and sell them. And now I'm doing this 
play." 
</P>
<P>
"This play" is Barbara Bishop's "Siblings," opening Thursday at the Gnu Theatre 
in North Hollywood. In it, Stone plays an artist trying to woo back his 
ladylove (Talia Balsam), whose rich sister has just been bumped off. "It's a 
whodunit," he said, "funny and scary. A play with murder. A murder mystery, but 
not really. . . . I hate to pigeonhole it, just like I hate to pigeonhole 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Stone's introduction to the Gnu came last year, when he saw Rafael Lima's "El 
Salvador" -- and was knocked out. That led to a meeting with the theater's 
director, Jeff Seymour, and recently the offer to read for this play. It will 
mark the first time that he's acted in 12 years. But there are no plans beyond 
that, and he's not quitting his day job at Stone/Powell Casting. "Right now, I 
want to do this play. Then I might act again -- or I might not." 
</P>
<P>
Stone's acting career began at age 5 when his mother took him and his 6 
1/2-year-old brother on an audition for Purina Cat Chow. "The man said, 'Say, 
"Here, kitty, kitty," ' and I said, 'No!' My brother said, 'Here, kitty, 
kitty.' The man said to me, 'Do you want to try it again?' 'No!' Three months 
later when I saw the commercial, I ran to my mom: 'Why is Jeff on TV and I'm 
not?' " 
</P>
<P>
From then on, he worked. 
</P>
<P>
"Corn Chex, Rice Chex, Wheat Chex, peanut butter, Tide, Crest, Mattel Hot 
Wheels, Nestle's Quik, Kodak film," Stone said, reeling off his commercials. "I 
was a very quiet, happy kid, very into myself. But when I was in front of the 
camera, in front of people, I opened up. I remember a wrap party and everyone 
was patting my head, telling me how good I was. I know it sounds sick, but it 
was one of the happiest moments of my childhood and the first time I ever felt 
loved." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't getting it from his peers. "Kids would come up and say, 'You were in 
a commercial,' and I'd say, 'So what?' I thought every kid did it. It was never 
a big deal to me 'cause I'd done it my whole life. But at about 12, you start 
noticing your body, a pimple. I went through this real awkward stage: short, 
kind of gangly, unattractive, awkward and insecure." 
</P>
<P>
Stone was also perennially on the move. "I must have lived 15 places when I was 
a kid," he said without rancor. "In elementary school I always felt I was 
strange -- like, 'How could this baseball game be important?' I never looked at 
my life from a kid's point of view. It was from a serious, adult point of view. 
When I'm casting kids now, I tell them, 'If you want to do this, you've got to 
commit to it like an adult. It's an adult job.' " 
</P>
<P>
For him, it was also a haven away from school. He still speaks of junior high 
as "hell," and remembers kids who weren't allowed to play with him because his 
parents were divorced. "I was like a fish out of water," he said. "I had no 
friends. I never fit in." The adult search for connection brought marriage and 
divorce -- and, seven years ago, a conversion to Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
Home is an English country house in Toluca Lake, beautifully remodeled. He has 
a swell career and could pass for Tom Cruise's better-looking brother. And yet, 
Stone says quietly, "I still feel different. I always think, 'What am I doing 
different than everyone else?' That's why I decided to do what I want to do, 
instead of second-guessing myself all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The quality that's served him best in casting? "Taste," he said good-naturedly. 
Also an affinity for actors. Stone's TV-movie credits include the Emmy-winning 
"Bill" with Mickey Rooney, "A Long Way Home" with Timothy Hutton and "Adam" 
with Daniel J. Travanti and JoBeth Williams. Stone/Powell Casting is now 
finishing a movie-of-the-week for CBS; the week after the play opens, they'll 
start work on another one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier with a good project," he admitted. "Like when I was casting 
'Cheers,' it was easier to get great actors to do that show. But sometimes it's 
a challenge. When I was casting 'Adam,' nobody wanted to play the mom. The part 
wasn't written. Everything was off the page. But JoBeth was smart enough to 
know she didn't have to be talking. Her most incredible moments are between the 
lines." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Stone is enjoying taking those acting rigors on himself. "People are 
going to put me down for doing this play," he said. "They want to put you in 
one place. They don't like you to deviate. They say, 'Aren't you happy? You 
must love your job.' The truth is, I'm never satisfied. I'll never be 
satisfied. I mean, I want to do everything. I wish I could live to be 200 years 
old."

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: BEBOP, HOME OF RECORDS AND CONCERTS, TEETERING ON THE FISCAL 
BRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future of BeBop Records &amp; Fine Art in Reseda, never a highly profitable 
and secure business, is once again in doubt, according to its owner, Richard 
Bruland. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much longer we can keep going," Bruland said. "I haven't been 
able to pay June's rent yet." 
</P>
<P>
Operating in a precarious financial state is nothing new for Bruland. It what 
he expected when he started his record store in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his competitors, who display the latest big-name releases, Bruland sells 
mostly oldies and offbeat records. At night, his store turns into a 
mini-concert venue -- 49-seat capacity -- especially appealing for acoustic 
singers and songwriters. He doesn't charge for the shows. 
</P>
<P>
But record sales have decreased in recent months, partially due to poor 
attendance at concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to rely on consistently well-attended concerts, and we're not getting 
that," he said. "We've had some cancellations and had shows where less than 10 
people have shown up. And I need people in the store to buy the records." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, though, Bruland remains an optimist. He's had shows over the 
years filled to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had bad times before and something always happens to keep us going," he 
said. "But the possibility of closing is always here." 
</P>
<P>
Two Westside music venues -- the Coconut Teaszer in West Hollywood and the 
Breakaway in Venice -- have started new special shows. 
</P>
<P>
A new series called "The Coconut Teaszer presents L.A.'s Best-Kept Secrets" 
began Tuesday. The series, which will stage shows every other Tuesday night, is 
designed to showcase unsigned acts who have often appeared at the club. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to get more exposure for these bands that we like so much," 
said Audrey Marpoc, an assistant at the club. "We will invite all kinds of 
record people from different labels to see these bands. And it gives us 
credibility, too. If they become really successful, it makes us look good." 
</P>
<P>
Marpoc said the only requirement for the bands is that they are unsigned. She 
said each show will present about six bands, doing 20-minute sets each. 
Ideally, she said, each Tuesday night will offer a different musical theme. 
</P>
<P>
The first show's bands were Rebel Train, David Shelly, Slave, The Sheilas, Rain 
on Fire and Sacred Heart. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Breakaway, a new country music night has started Wednesdays. 
Jay Tinksy, talent coordinator for the restaurant/club, said: "There didn't 
seem to be enough country outlets for the amount of talented country artists. 
We will present the professional talent, as well as the new guy. We're not 
going to turn away Dwight Yoakam." 
</P>
<P>
Tinksy added that the country performers will be doing acoustic sets, which 
fits in perfectly with the club's format. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Mack, who hosts KCSN's weekly Tuesday night Barn Dance at the Palomino 
in North Hollywood, said he believes that the country night at the Breakaway 
stands a good chance of succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
"The place is suited for acoustic music and has a built-in audience already," 
Mack said. "Anything that promotes more country is good."

CHARLES RUTHERFORD; CANADIAN HERO OF WORLD WAR I 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Rutherford, 97, a Canadian who was the last surviving holder of the 
Victoria Cross in World War I. An obituary, published in London's Daily 
Telegraph, said Rutherford won the medal Aug. 26, 1918, when the Canadian 
platoon he was commanding captured a French village giving observers a view of 
the defenses of the German Hindenberg Line. Only 18 days earlier, Rutherford 
had won the coveted Military Cross for bravery by capturing another village on 
Aug. 8, when the Allied offensive that would end the war began that day in 
front of Amiens. Rutherford rejoined the army in World War II and took part in 
protecting the Duke of Windsor in the Bahamas and guarding prisoner-of-war 
camps in Canada. Before retirement he was postmaster at Colborne, Ontario. The 
Victoria Cross, the highest British honor for battlefield courage, was awarded 
to 633 people during World War I. In Ottawa on a date not reported.

VIETNAMESE GIRL'S ESSAY ON CONTRASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to the essay written by 11-year-old Tuyet Tran (June 
11). I thank The Times for publishing her letter unedited, allowing her message 
to come to the readers directly from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Tuyet's poignantly composed essay contrasting the horrors of Communistic 
Vietnam and the beauty of America and its people touched me deeply. It does 
sadden me, however, to think about the many "beautiful people" Tuyet refers to 
who do not always welcome her with open arms and minds. 
</P>
<P>
As a teacher, I see on a daily basis the insights children have about ideas 
such as freedom, tyranny, and simple acceptance of others. I am also convinced 
it is the children who can make a difference and change the world for the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, Tuyet's simple, moving essay was able to remind we Americans how 
fortunate we are to live in a democracy blessed with freedom, void of tyranny 
and rich in cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
I send my heartfelt respect to Tuyet, her family and teachers who have 
obviously had a positive impact on her life.

HOSPITAL'S DECISION TO TURN AWAY PREGNANT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Vance Gardner's "Taking Responsibility for Medical Care" (June 
11), I want to state that I have no problem whatsoever seeing to it that my tax 
dollars go to aid the health of indigent or elderly people who are in need. 
</P>
<P>
But I resent having to subsidize indigent Hispanic women who seem to think that 
their mission in life is to bear more and more children. Not only are these 
women unable to support themselves but they cannot support those kids. 
</P>
<P>
We are no longer living at a time when infant mortality was high and many 
children were needed to see if any survive to take care of aging parents. 
Enough is enough!

$96 TICKET THAT POLICE GAVE TO YOUNG BICYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "The 15-Year-Old Bicyclist Who Got a $96 Ticket" by Joanne Thomas (June 11): 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it a shame that Mrs. Thomas is "outraged with the Irvine Police 
Department" for issuing a ticket to her son for failure to stop his bike at a 
stop sign? What does she think a stop sign is for? Why does she condone his 
breaking of the law? What message is she giving him by "fighting in court" when 
she knows he is guilty? 
</P>
<P>
You break the law, you pay! And whose fault is it that she must take "time off 
from work and valuable court time" to fight this heinous crime? This woman 
needs help in positive parenting. I would never condone my children's behavior 
in a similar situation.

COUNCIL ELECTION FOR LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 6 I was elected to the Laguna Hills City Council. But I can't serve. In 
the same election, the Laguna Hills cityhood proposal was narrowly defeated. 
There is no city for the city council to govern. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that I have had the dubious distinction of being 
elected to a non-existent city council. In November, 1988, I ran as a council 
candidate opposed to the different, and much larger, proposed incorporation of 
a Saddleback Valley city. Ironically, I was elected to the council of the 
Saddleback city, which I helped to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
While I sincerely appreciate the trust and confidence repeatedly expressed by 
my fellow residents, I have little tangible evidence of these victories except 
for a large campaign debt! But, coming to know and work with many fine, 
concerned residents of Laguna Hills, Leisure World and the surrounding 
neighborhoods and cities, has made it all worthwhile. I thank each of them for 
their interest in the cityhood issue, and for their support of my candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
And, when our community next votes on incorporation, and selects a city 
council, maybe I'll get it right.

$96 TICKET THAT POLICE GAVE TO YOUNG BICYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding two letters today (June 11), I commend the first, "Bicycle Safety" by 
Alan Johnson. As to the second, "The 15-Year-Old Bicyclist Who Got a $96 
Ticket" by Joanne Thomas: I've been a lifelong bicyclist, so at 44 years of age 
that amounts to some knowledge of the sport/pastime. For the last several years 
I've also worn a badge as an officer, a lieutenant with the Idledale Volunteer 
Fire Department located high in the Colorado Rockies west of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
On more than one occasion, I've looked down on the broken, lifeless body of a 
young child who had decided it was 'cool' to run a light or a stop sign. More 
often, I've been involved with the cleanup of accident scenes resulting from 
drivers trying to avoid careless cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
As for riding while wearing earphones, I recall once rounding a sharp curve 
with siren blaring, lights rotating -- to find three cyclists riding abreast, 
each with earphones. If it were not for my awareness and professionalism, they 
would have died that day! 
</P>
<P>
My highest commendation to the officer who ticketed the boy! How sad that the 
parents will go to court to "fight" this. My experience in Colorado with 
situations like this was that, invariably, the parents would haul the kid to 
the station house, by the ear if necessary. The child would apologize to the 
officer, promise not to do it again and the parents would offer thanks. Often 
at that point, the ticket would "disappear." Looks like here in California, you 
placate the child, blame the cops and phone the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
What the officer really did was to try to give the boy a future, a life. 
Growing up, raising children of his own someday -- instead of being another 
statistic.

$96 TICKET THAT POLICE GAVE TO YOUNG BICYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have a few questions for the Irvine resident who is outraged with the Irvine 
Police Department because her son was given a $96 ticket for failure to make a 
complete stop at a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
You claim he was a first-time offender -- do you mean this was the first time 
he had failed to stop for a stop sign, or the first time he was caught? You 
compare his ticket with a friend you know of who received a less-expensive 
ticket for "the same offense." Did your friend only fail to stop, while your 
son may have failed to yield the right of way to another vehicle? Is it 
possible that the policeman who ticketed your son has seen too many bicycle-car 
accidents in which the bicyclist is seriously injured (and usually at fault)? 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, what kind of message are you giving your son about accepting 
responsibility for his actions as you leap to his defense?

TRADE LAWS MAY BACKFIRE ON U.S. FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OSWALD JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To members of Congress who are seeking to protect American manufacturers from 
what they regard as unfair competition from abroad, the massive trade law they 
enacted last year stands as a monument of hard-nosed realism. 
</P>
<P>
But to a wide range of U.S. businesses that stand to suffer from its 
implementation, the act is only another sorry example of the law of unintended 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point: the heightened threat of 100% tariffs against an array of 54 
Japanese imports in retaliation for Japan's failure to open its market in 
mobile radio and cellular telephone services and equipment to U.S. 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola, the lone U.S. manufacturer that was significantly damaged by Japan's 
closed telecommunications markets, prevailed upon the office of U.S. Trade 
Representative Carla A. Hills to retaliate under the terms of the 1988 trade 
act, which increased the likelihood that such tariffs would be imposed when 
circumstances warranted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Will Be Hit? 
</P>
<P>
Hills' office has listed 54 Japanese products, ranging from high-tech computer 
equipment to cosmetics, that are under consideration for retaliatory tariffs. 
Its job now is to determine which products should be hit. 
</P>
<P>
To users of each of those 54 products, the answer is clear: Not the ones we 
need. They argue that the tariffs would block their ability to buy the 
low-cost, high-quality parts that enable them to compete in international 
markets -- against, primarily, the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"We applaud the proposed action, but . . . ," said Robert N. Noyce, chief 
executive of Sematech, the new consortium of American semiconductor and 
computer companies that has joined to compete with Japan in the production of 
high-end microprocessors, semiconductors and other computer components. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big "but." Sematech, which has sought government financing and partial 
shielding from antitrust laws, is far from averse to the idea of managed trade, 
if that would help it compete with Japan. But in Sematech's view, punitive 
tariffs that could block the import of high-tech Japanese equipment needed to 
produce even higher-tech semiconductors and computers would be 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
"The suggested sanctions against the Japanese will, in fact, harm the U.S. 
semiconductor industry by forcing American companies to pay tariff-inflated 
prices for certain semiconductor equipment," Noyce told the trade 
representative's office at a May 24 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Japanese have targeted that industry segment and have achieved 
dominating technological superiority in certain segments, the proposed tariffs 
would serve only to provide Japanese semiconductor suppliers with a competitive 
advantage," Noyce said. 
</P>
<P>
He concluded: "We have to be careful of the unintended actions of such 
well-deserved and well-intentioned sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
Sematech's predicament is an inevitable price of retaliation, said Lionel 
Olmer, a former Commerce Department trade official who has been doing battle 
with the Japanese for years. 
</P>
<P>
"What always happens in these cases is that the same companies that are 
lobbying the U.S. government to be tough are also trying to make sure the 
retaliation doesn't jeopardize any of their suppliers or business interests," 
Olmer said in an interview. "But it's impossible not to jeopardize somebody's 
interest. There's no question about the law of unintended circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't avoid goring someone's ox," added Kenneth S. Flamm, a specialist in 
trade and high-technology industries at the Brookings Institution. "It's a pit 
full of snakes we've descended into, and it's not clear who'll get bitten and 
who will survive." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the tariffs in retaliation for Japan's closed mobile radio and 
cellular telephone markets, the lobbying is going on mostly in public. It was 
concentrated in the May 24 hearing at the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative. 
</P>
<P>
Another company testifying that day was Amdahl, one of the few remaining 
players in the competition with Japan to score first with the next generation 
of supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Amdahl explained that its bread-and-butter product, the commercial Amdahl model 
5590 mainframe computer, depends on Japanese suppliers for about half of its 
components. With the 100% tariffs proposed in the telecommunications case, 
Amdahl "will have no choice but to pay a penalty projected to be in the range 
of $40 million to $50 million annually," said Joseph Zemke, company spokesman, 
at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
That figure, Zemke said, amounts to about 25% of Amdahl's annual $200-million 
budget for research and development -- the very lifeblood of its effort to 
develop a better supercomputer. 
</P>
<P>
"A critical requirement for success in the highly competitive global 
data-processing marketplace is the unyielding need to constantly incorporate 
the finest technologies available worldwide," Zemke said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Markets Are Interdependent 
</P>
<P>
"To remain competitive in this marketplace, no company can permit either local 
or national borders to limit its technology sources. On the other hand, no one 
country or company enjoys a monopoly on these items for very long. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the entire industry -- including companies like IBM, Cray and 
Amdahl -- have found it necessary to incorporate varying percentages of 
foreign-made components and sub-assemblies in their products in order to 
successfully compete within the U.S. and overseas." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Zemke said, "retaliation as currently proposed could make Amdahl 
less competitive in the very market the U.S. seeks to open through this 
proceeding -- Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The ironies abound. The telecommunications case is based primarily on a 
complaint by Motorola, a leading U.S. semiconductor and electronics 
manufacturer that has been told by Japan it may not operate cellular telephone 
services in the Tokyo area. 
</P>
<P>
But two leading opponents of the retaliation that Motorola's complaint has set 
in motion are two other major U.S. providers of cellular telephone and mobile 
radio services: Bell Atlantic and General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subsidiaries Also Hurt 
</P>
<P>
Subsidiaries of both companies explained at the May 24 hearing that the process 
of opening Japan's markets for the convenience of Motorola also would cut off 
Japan as a key supplier of equipment for the goods and services they provide in 
the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. cellular telephone industry depends heavily upon a ready supply of 
reasonably priced cellular products from Japan," Bell Atlantic said. 
</P>
<P>
GE said that, if its mobile division is forced to pay tariff-inflated prices 
for the mobile radio equipment that sustains its cellular telephone production, 
"our position in the marketplace will be untenable." 
</P>
<P>
American subsidiaries of Japanese firms also stand to be harmed. Japanese 
electronics companies have made major investments in the United States, and 
American subsidiaries of the Japanese-controlled international giants 
Mitsubishi and Fujitsu were among the companies that testified against 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Fujitsu has established a firm foothold as a minority owner of Amdahl, 
two of whose directors are top executives of the Japanese firm. To Flamm of 
Brookings, such interrelationships make unintended consequences almost 
inevitable when the government pursues a policy of managed trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The interdependence of the two markets -- the United States and Japan -- has 
never been more obvious than in the computer-semiconductor field," Flamm said. 
"But the American computer manufacturers, who know they need Japanese 
components to help them maintain their competitive edge over the Japanese, are 
not very happy about it. They don't like being dependent on Japan for this 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, however, the Japanese depend on the Americans as the main 
market for the semiconductors they produce. 
</P>
<P>
It is not quite inevitable that the U.S. trade representative's office will 
order retaliatory tariffs in the case of Japan's mobile radio and cellular 
telephone markets. The office has quietly informed the Japanese that they can 
escape retaliation if they can negotiate a satisfactory market-opening 
arrangement with Motorola by July 10. 
</P>
<P>
Olmer would be surprised if the Japanese Ministry of Posts and 
Telcommunications, legendary for its inward-looking indifference to Japan's 
wider global trade interests, reverses course and strikes a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the section of the 1988 trade law that mandates retaliation for 
alleged unfair trading practices, Olmer said: "The problem is, once Section 301 
becomes a body in motion, it's almost impossible to stop." 
</P>
<P>
But it is probable that many of the products listed as eligible for 
retaliation, many of them goods totally unrelated to cellular phones or two-way 
radios, will be dropped from the final list. 
</P>
<P>
At present, for instance, certain Japanese cosmetics are on the list. Estee 
Lauder Inc., a major U.S. cosmetics firm, objected. 
</P>
<P>
Lauder has established a 10% market share in the Japanese cosmetics market, and 
it warns that tariffs against Japan's comparatively minor penetration of the 
U.S. market would only invite damaging retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Harris/3M Documents Products Inc., which provides office copying services at 
the middle and lower range of the U.S. commercial market, offered yet another 
kind of argument. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed punitive tariff on Japanese photocopying equipment, it said, would 
damage its own business by raising costs. But it would do nothing to protect 
U.S. photocopier manufacturers, which have virtually abandoned the low end of 
the market to the Japanese.

DEREGULATED PAY PHONES SPAWN CONSUMER GRIPES, PROMISE NEW SERVICES

<TEXT>
<P>
Airline pilot Bill Conrey routinely stays at hotels along his flight path, 
regularly phoning home to Tennessee and charging the calls on his AT&amp;T 
"Calling Card." He considers such expenses unavoidable in his line of work, and 
normally is a good judge of what hotel calls cost. 
</P>
<P>
So Conrey was stunned when he spotted a $50 charge on his phone bill for a call 
from Washington that he had expected to cost about $25. Moreover, the charge 
wasn't from AT&amp;T, but from a long-distance company he'd never heard of. 
</P>
<P>
When Conrey investigated, he learned that the hotel had changed management, and 
the new team had cut a deal with another long-distance carrier that offered to 
pay more to handle the hotel's phone service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a legitimate long-distance company," Conrey complained. "They're 
just providing a service where they can bill you twice as much as AT&amp;T!" 
</P>
<P>
Conrey is not the only telephone customer outraged by unexpectedly high bills 
for calls made from hotel rooms or from coin-operated phones. Deregulation of 
the pay-phone business, a byproduct of the 1984 breakup of American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph, has brought forth a legion of new pay-phone entrepreneurs, 
looser governmental oversight -- and a flood of consumer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of the complaints has changed somewhat over the five years since 
private investors -- not just AT&amp;T and local phone companies -- were 
allowed to buy, install and operate pay phones and to handle phone service in 
hotels, motels and hospitals. Poor service and simple mechanical breakdowns on 
private pay phones remain problems, but these are diminishing as technology 
improves. Meanwhile, regulatory reform has reduced complaints in some parts of 
the country, including California, about high charges from little-known phone 
companies on calls from private pay phones at shopping centers, restaurants, 
bars and other high-traffic sites. 
</P>
<P>
But room-phone service remains exempt from regulation and continues to draw 
heavy fire from consumers. "They are totally unregulated," said John O'Keefe, 
president of the California Payphone Assn. and a former Pacific Bell executive. 
"The burden is really on the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is suffering under pay-phone deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
Innkeepers, restaurateurs and convenience-store operators are benefiting from 
the commissions they receive for allowing private pay phones to be installed on 
their premises. New enterprises, as well as vending firms that have added pay 
phones to their other coin-operated machines, maintain the phones and share the 
revenue with the property owners. 
</P>
<P>
And the pay-phone business is getting even better these days, thanks to 
so-called alternative operator services -- new companies that provide 
credit-card and collect-call service for pay-phone owners and long-distance 
carriers that have no operators of their own. These operator-assisted calls 
produce hefty revenues that once eluded owners of private pay phones. 
Previously, their customers could dial an AT&amp;T or local operator for 
nothing and charge their calls, providing revenue for the operator's company 
but nothing at all for the phone's owner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Gouging 
</P>
<P>
It's another story, however, for consumers such as Gayla Daugherty, who sells 
insurance in Oklahoma City. Daugherty said she placed an early-morning call 
home from a hotel room in Las Vegas and, like Conrey, used her AT&amp;T Calling 
Card. Only later did she learn that the operator who handled her call was not 
an AT&amp;T employee, as she had assumed, but worked for an alternative 
operator service allied with another long-distance carrier. As a result, her 
call was billed at more than $1 a minute at an hour of the day when AT&amp;T 
would have charged about half that. 
</P>
<P>
"I was livid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The lodging industry insists that price gouging on room phones is the 
exception, not the rule -- certainly among those hotels catering to repeat 
customers, particularly business travelers and affluent vacationers. Michele 
Kelley, spokeswoman for the American Hotel-Motel Assn., said innkeepers also 
have a right to recover the cost of their investment in telecommunications 
equipment, especially in view of demands by guests for such new services as 
electronic checkout. 
</P>
<P>
Still, unexpectedly high tolls charged by unfamiliar companies are only part of 
what galled Daugherty and Conrey. How was it possible, they wondered, that 
another carrier could take their business when they had charged their calls -- 
or thought they had -- to AT&amp;T? 
</P>
<P>
The answer goes back once again to the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. 
</P>
<P>
Before AT&amp;T and its local phone companies were forced to go their separate 
ways, it was the subsidiaries, the so-called Baby Bells, that issued telephone 
charge cards. Their customers could use these to make local and long-distance 
calls while away from home. When AT&amp;T and the locals parted company, 
however, AT&amp;T had to develop its own card and, in doing so, used subscriber 
data maintained by the Baby Bells. 
</P>
<P>
But the Baby Bells also were required to make the same information available to 
other carriers and operator-service firms. Consequently, the newcomers were 
able to use AT&amp;T's Calling Card data to bill for their own calls, and 
customers often learned the difference only after their local phone bills 
arrived, listing their away-from-home calls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horror Stories 
</P>
<P>
Now, to meet complaints by its customers, AT&amp;T plans to issue cards with 
new codings that can't be used by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative operator services have created consumer confusion and generated 
complaints almost since they first appeared in 1985. Since then, the Federal 
Communications Commission has received more than 2,000 complaints regarding 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Although industry executives acknowledge some horror stories, such as those 
related by Conrey and Daugherty, they insist that most were the unintended 
consequences of introducing competition in a former monopoly area and that, in 
any case, the worst is over. Moreover, they promise that the payoff for 
consumers, in the form of such new pay-phone services as voice-messaging, is 
less than a year away, thanks to development of new software and other 
technology designed to increase the private phones' versatility. Such services, 
they say, would never have come about were the old Bell System monopoly still 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
"We pay a price for freedom and innovation," said Paul Gamberg, founder and 
president of Operator Service Providers of America, a year-old trade group. 
"The litany of horror stories is part of that price." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those bad experiences, Gamberg said, stemmed from converting a complex 
network originally built to serve a single entity, into one able to serve many 
companies offering a variety of services at different prices. "We are doing our 
best to clean up our industry, but we all have to funnel through the bottleneck 
that is the old Bell System." 
</P>
<P>
Gamberg's view is supported by consumer advocate Ken McEldowney of San 
Francisco-based Consumer Action and past president of the Consumer Federation 
of America. "It's a system that was not set up for competition," McEldowney 
agreed. "It's not just bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the emergence of hotel billing problems, the appearance of 
privately owned coin phones brought "incredible price gouging," acknowledged 
O'Keefe of the California Payphone Assn. But that, he insisted, "has really 
settled down." For one thing, O'Keefe said, some of the worst offenders, 
particularly active in Florida and North Carolina, are no longer in business. 
And the survivors are setting their own service standards to avoid future 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
But if the worst is past, problems continue for captive consumers, as trucker 
Kevin Krofchik can testify. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Reforms 
</P>
<P>
Krofchik drives a tractor-trailer from his home in the Washington suburbs, and 
he uses whatever pay phones he can find at truck stops along his route. Like 
many a hotel guest, he charges the calls to his AT&amp;T Calling Card. But last 
February, Krofchik's phone bill showed calls handled by a company called 
International Telecharge Inc., or ITI, that totaled $36.12. That's 2 1/2 times 
the cost, he calculated in a complaint filed with the Federal Communications 
Commission, of the same long-distance calls over AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
At one stop, when Krofchik tried to reach AT&amp;T, the ITI operator invited 
him to find another pay phone, causing the trucker to point out to the FCC: "It 
is difficult for a loaded tractor-trailer weighing over 75,000 pounds to drive 
through congested cities looking for a regular telephone." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of such experiences, some reforms have been imposed on the new 
operator-services firms and pay-phone owners. In California, for example, the 
Public Utilities Commission has limited the amount that private pay-phone 
owners can charge on calls within the state to a maximum of 10 cents more than 
applicable local phone company or AT&amp;T charges. And the PUC is expected 
this summer to approve a comprehensive agreement among Pacific Bell, GTE 
California, consumer advocates and the smaller firms that will, O'Keefe 
predicted, "bring stability to the pay-phone marketplace in California." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the new agreement calls for the private pay phones to roll 
back their price for making a local call to 20 cents, instead of the 25 cents 
they have been allowed, and to freeze it there for five years. And the local 
phone companies agreed to pay private phone owners for toll-free calls placed 
on their telephones. 
</P>
<P>
But such regulations do not apply to calls between states, which provide "most 
of the money these companies make," said David Wagenhauser, who heads the 
Telecommunications Research and Action Center, or TRAC. "That's the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission," he said, "and the FCC, 
to put it mildly, has been lax." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Limits 
</P>
<P>
Last Feb. 27, however, the FCC responded to a complaint TRAC filed last summer 
by imposing the first standards for interstate pay-phone services. These 
include requiring all operators to identify their companies and to make 
available information on prices. They also must try to connect callers with the 
long-distance carrier of their choice. (Not all pay phones have this 
capability.) 
</P>
<P>
But TRAC, which still wants federally imposed price limits, has appealed the 
FCC decision. 
</P>
<P>
Support is building in Congress, meanwhile, to enact proposed telephone 
operator consumer protection legislation introduced by Rep. Jim Cooper 
(D-Tenn.) in response to constituent complaints. That measure, which won 
unanimous approval last month from the House telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee, seeks to protect consumers from unfair rates and unpleasant 
surprises without squelching the new competitors. It has the support of the 
Washington-based Competitive Telecommunications Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Evans, vice president of Van Nuys-based Com Systems, a long-distance 
carrier with its own operators, said consumer complaints run in cycles as 
private pay-phone vendors and operator-service companies enter new areas. 
"Where competition has been in place for 12 months, the complaints start going 
down," he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, private pay phones are better built today. Mark L. Mawrence, vice 
president of corporate development for U.S. Teletron, a fast-growing City of 
Industry partnership that supplies and operates 2,000 investor-owned pay 
phones, said fewer than 5% of its high-technology machines are out of service 
at any one time -- about half the rate, he said, for the much simpler Bell 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 New Software 
</P>
<P>
Improved equipment is important because, unlike most phone-company instruments, 
which are controlled by the local switching office, privately owned phones have 
to contain within them all the smarts needed to price calls and collect and 
return coins. At an industry meeting last April organized in Las Vegas by 
Telestrategies, an industry support firm in McLean, Va., telecommunications 
equipment vendors showed off pay phones that could transmit facsimiles as well 
as a system that automates even operator assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Mawrence said his company and a national hotel chain are about to start testing 
"operator-in-a-box" software enabling innkeepers to connect guests directly to 
the guests' desired carriers and provide automated operator assistance at 
competitive rates, plus a specified surcharge to compensate the hotel for its 
equipment investment. That system, he said, will meet the hotels' revenue needs 
without undue cost to guests. This, he predicted, will become "the standard 
within a few years." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Commissioner Andrew Barrett of the Illinois Commerce Commission, who 
spoke at the gathering, said the key to consumer acceptance of the newcomers is 
"lower prices -- or at least reasonable prices -- and more choices and better 
services." So far, Barrett added, "the public is not seeing any of those 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, consumer advocate McEldowney said that, while new services are 
likely, he doubts that rates will decline much for basic calling, despite the 
new competition for customers. That troubles both him and Gene Kimmelman, 
legislative director of Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
"They may say we offer you greater services and quality and you should pay more 
for them -- and that's fine, if you want the greater services and quality," 
Kimmelman said. "But if all you want is basic service -- plain vanilla -- why 
should you have to pay more?"

FIT FOODS: HOT FARE AT FUND-RAISERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, a typical hotel banquet meal consisted of a fat-marbled cut of 
beef smothered in gravy, vegetables drenched in butter and gooey desserts piled 
high with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't unusual to find this kind of artery-choking menu at fund-raisers 
for organizations battling heart disease and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But now groups such as the American Heart Assn. and the American Cancer Society 
realize that their reputations are at stake when they serve a meal to hundreds 
of supporters. If their dietary guidelines recommend high-fiber, low-fat foods, 
how good can it look to serve fatty red meat and ice cream cakes? 
</P>
<P>
"We do our best to work with hotels and caterers to provide meals that are 
consistent with the American Heart Association guidelines," said a spokesman 
for the association's Los Angeles chapter. "There's nothing wrong with eating 
red meat, as long as it's lean red meat. But I must say that it's probably 
unusual for us to serve beef these days; most of the dishes are chicken or 
fish." 
</P>
<P>
At Heart Assn. functions, margarine is substituted for butter, cream sauces are 
verboten, chicken is served without the skin and desserts are low in fat. 
Changes like these have been taking place in the last five years, thanks to 
diligent dietitians and savvy public relations executives who see the value in 
not serving bacon and eggs at breakfast meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society has "no written policy" on what to serve at 
official functions, said Gail Luhmann, communications director for the Desert 
Palms unit. 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't stopped the organization from adhering to unwritten guidelines, 
such as no fried, high-fat or high-cholesterol foods and no heavy sauces and 
dressings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a background of 20 years as a caterer and event planner," said Luhmann, 
"and I know that things can be presented to caterers so that you can get them 
to serve things the way you'd like. They may want to serve potato salad and 
cold cuts, but you don't necessarily have to." 
</P>
<P>
In the Palm Springs area, where events take place "every night of the week" 
during the winter months, "People are very health-conscious," she added. 
"They're all aware of what they're eating. And a lot of people who have retired 
here are former corporate executives coming from high-stress jobs. They're more 
aware of their diet, especially if they've had a health scare (like a heart 
attack). It is important to them." 
</P>
<P>
Lenore Shapiro of Rancho Mirage was one of the planners of the Cancer Society's 
fund-raiser last December. On the menu was a lobster appetizer with melon balls 
and a ginger dressing; a salad of mixed field greens with olive oil 
vinaigrette; a veal chop with morel sauce, steamed vegetables and a dessert 
featuring fresh raspberries and strawberries in a light puff pastry with an 
optional zabaglione sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast that with a Cancer Society dinner eight years ago in Anaheim, where 
filet mignon with bearnaise sauce was the entree with tarts for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everybody Loved It' 
</P>
<P>
"It seems most of the chefs now are trying to prepare healthier meals now," 
Shapiro said. "The reaction from people at this dinner was good; everybody 
loved it and said that they felt good after a lighter meal." 
</P>
<P>
Hotel banquet chefs and caterers are in sync with the public's new eating 
habits and most are willing to work with groups with special dietary needs. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had a diabetic foundation in for a dinner, and they wanted us to do a 
meal with no sugar in it," said Biltmore hotel executive chef Roger E. Pigozzi. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge was the dessert, and they said everywhere they go they get fresh 
fruit. That's the easy way out. I started playing around with ideas, and I 
ended up poaching a pear, took the core out, stuffed it with raisins and 
slivered almonds and cinnamon and served it with a raspberry sauce. We'll be 
featuring it at our restaurant Bernard's for our summer menu as one of our 
lighter desserts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trend Spreads 
</P>
<P>
Health organizations aren't the only ones concerned with better menus. The 
trend toward healthier foods is spreading across all groups who are heeding 
warnings about high-fat, high-cholesterol and salt saturated foods. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Gilron, director of catering at the Century Plaza hotel, another 
favorite of the banquet set, serves only "two or three" prime rib dinners a 
year, far less than he served years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although beef is still popular, Gilron says it's a less fatty cut that's being 
served, along with veal, another frequently requested entree. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," he added, "chicken has always been popular, but if there's a 
stigma attached because of chicken being cheaper, then a group may spend more 
money on the starter course and the dessert. We're also serving less rich 
desserts, and things like a goose liver pate sauce -- that's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Alex Gordon served "an awful lot of beef" at banquets. "Now," 
said the executive chef of the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel, "the more you 
learn, the more you know. The media caught on to the negative side of eating 
too much red meat, and in the course of a few months, we went from serving 250 
prime ribs to 250 fish plates. We still serve beef, but now we're serving more 
veal than beef. People are looking for new alternatives. They're tired of 
rubber chicken. So for lunch we'll serve a Thai chicken salad marinated in 
garlic and ginger and served cold on top of a bed of greens and water 
chestnuts." 
</P>
<P>
Every hotel serving large groups keeps alternate dishes on hand for diners with 
special dietary needs. A few steamed vegetable plates, fruit plates or steamed 
fish dishes are always available (although etiquette dictates that guests tell 
the host ahead of time to save the kitchen any surprises). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vegetarian Gains Fans 
</P>
<P>
Vegetarian dishes have gotten so popular among his clientele that Ray 
Henderson, vice president and menu planner of Rococo caterers, hired a 
vegetarian chef just three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the hardest time serving red meat," he said. "We just recently did a 
big party where we had food stations, and decided to have one with carved steak 
for whoever wanted it. We took back so much of the meat. The guests were eating 
pastas and pizza." 
</P>
<P>
"More people now than ever before are asking, 'What's in this? How is it 
prepared?' " Henderson added. "Salt and cholesterol are the two big no-nos. 
We're also having people ask us to do recipes sanctioned by the American Heart 
Association and the Pritikin program." 
</P>
<P>
And while he does get requests from hosts to serve rich desserts, many of the 
guests refuse them altogether or opt for unadulterated fresh fruit.

DADDY DEAREST; 
</P>
<P>
WHO GETS THE LAST LAUGH WHEN FATHER-SON COMICS BOB AND CHRIS ELLIOTT TEAM UP ON 
OFF-THE-WALL TELL-ALL BOOK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hugh Downs actually slapped his knee he was so amused by what was happening on 
the monitor in the "Tonight Show's" green room. His daughter, watching the same 
monitor, rolled her eyes and grimaced. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Leno's guests, Bob and Chris Elliott, father and son, were making a 
shameless pre-Father's Day pitch for Chris' book "Daddy's Boy," a "Shocking 
Account of Life with a Famous Father." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, they waltzed a dangerous line between droll and dumb, and as Chris 
described his sixth birthday party -- at which columnist Art Buchwald allegedly 
rode around on the Elliott family's giant trained pig -- people watching from 
behind the scenes seemed evenly divided as to which side of the line the two 
comedians were on. 
</P>
<P>
A partner in the comedy team Bob and Ray, Bob Elliott has spent four decades 
building a reputation as a sort of anti-celebrity. Which may have had some 
viewers wondering how his son Chris could write an offspring expose, portraying 
his father as an "insane, megalomaniacal superstar," driven to bizarre and 
sadistic behavior by an insatiable lust for fame. 
</P>
<P>
The viewers who wonder about the book's veracity would be those who usually 
fall asleep after "Tonight." Those who stay awake for "Late Night with David 
Letterman" know that Chris, like his father, has made a career of absurdist 
satire, portraying characters with no comedic raison d'etre, including "the guy 
under the seats," "the fugitive guy" and "the panicky guy," a supposed audience 
member who is thrown into wild anxiety by Letterman's every innocuous comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Daddy's Boy," written by Chris with alternating "rebuttal" chapters by his 
father, seems to be part of the younger Elliott's self-designed rite of passage 
into the entertainment mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Acquired Taste' 
</P>
<P>
It's unclear to most observers whether his father ever made that passage. In 
his standard deadpan, Bob Elliott said that the humor he and Ray Goulding made 
famous in 40 years of commercials, radio shows, television shows, and 
appearances on Carson, Letterman, and "Saturday Night Live," is "an acquired 
taste." 
</P>
<P>
If comedians were cheese, though, Bob Elliott would be Velveeta and his son 
would be a Limburger whipped up by midget entrepreneurs in the humid gift shop 
of a Texas roadside attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, not everyone's sure that the world is ready for Chris. Even David 
Letterman, the person responsible for first subjecting viewers to Elliott fils, 
hedges his bet on the book. As he writes in his foreword: "I couldn't be more 
certain that it won't do well." 
</P>
<P>
Asked in a phone interview whether he thought Elliott's television appearances 
were going well, Letterman snarled: "I haven't seen any. I have better things 
to do than chart his career." 
</P>
<P>
"Have you read the book?" a young producer of "L.A. In the Morning" asked a 
visitor to the set, while the father and son settled in before a fake skyline 
for an interview with Stephanie Edwards. "It's very strange," he said with a 
nervous grin. "I don't know what to make of it." 
</P>
<P>
More important, what would a morning audience make of a book that asserts, 
among many other things, that Bob Elliott and his son escaped the sinking of 
the Andrea Doria ocean liner aboard a two-seat Hammacher Schlemmer submarine, 
arriving in Manhattan with Tony Orlando coincidentally swimming alongside? 
</P>
<P>
Edwards introduced the book as a son's "pathetic search for love," an expose 
that "makes the 'Mommy Dearest' relationship pale in comparison." She was quick 
to point out, of course, that the book can be taken seriously for "about 20 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
But as Chris gave Edwards his big smarmy grin, and reminisced about life in the 
family's palatial New York home, which would later become the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, some viewers may have been left unsure of where this alleged 
joke and reality intersect. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the abused celebrity offspring on the talk-show circuit, the 
Elliotts helped plug their "excellent Father's Day gift" with photos from the 
book: A young Chris wearing a Latex bald wig to accommodate a father who 
demanded they look alike; the adolescent boy, grotesquely obese, lying in bed 
with his eventual savior, Dick Gregory, kneeling beside him. 
</P>
<P>
"What was I, Dad, about 875 pounds?" Chris asked with casual sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you say," his father replied, looking bewildered and embarrassed, 
as if his son's psychiatrist had suggested that it might be therapeutic to 
humor Chris with this book tour but that he himself had serious doubts. 
</P>
<P>
The video clips Edwards showed offered no more insight into where Elliott 
sanity begins or ends. The first was old black-and-white footage in which Bob 
and Ray engage in a seemingly pointless discussion of a stuffed deer's head. 
</P>
<P>
The second clip showed Chris doing his impression of Marlon Brando. The idea 
behind the running skit is that the hefty Brando, uninvited, has started 
hanging out at the Letterman show. On this particular segment, Brando persuades 
Paul Shaffer's band to play "Alley Cat," while he dances around in a jazzy 
shuffle, ending each musical stanza with a goofy grin and the exclamation 
"Bananas!" 
</P>
<P>
The brief clip had most of the "Morning" camera operators and stage crew 
sputtering with laughter. But a few observers watched with puzzled frowns. 
</P>
<P>
That's to be expected, say those who appreciate the Dadaesque, 
meta-entertainment Elliott pursues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if someone tuned in (to Late Night) for the first time and saw one of 
Chris' pieces, they'd be baffled," said Adam Resnick, Chris' writing partner on 
the show. "The joke of Chris' character is that he's this guy who just wants to 
get on television, and when he does get on it's pretty lame. But he doesn't 
know it's lame." 
</P>
<P>
The result is that Elliott's humor is "funny-lame," Resnick said. That, as 
opposed to something like "Police Academy," which is "just stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Not that all stupidity has bad connotations with the "Late Night" staff. In 
fact, Resnick sounds as if he's giving the ultimate accolade in calling what 
Elliott does "silly stupid -- almost surreal stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Like Resnick, most admirers are sent into theoretical tailspins trying to 
define the younger Elliott's brand of humor, which most contend is related in 
some vague but significant way to his father's deadpan wit. 
</P>
<P>
"It has so many layers of irony in it, based on all this absorbed information 
and emotion from the theater and movies and TV and so on, that you can't really 
describe it," said Steve O'Donnell), the Letterman show's head writer. "It's 
not just ironic . . . I'd put it somewhere between complicated parody and 
buffoonish slapstick." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's along the line of Salman Rushdie's sense of humor," said 
sportscaster Marv Albert, a " 'Late Night' regular" and Elliott fan, even 
though he is the occasional butt of the comic's on-air lampoons. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is so kind in their assessment of the comedian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He 'Takes Chances' 
</P>
<P>
"Chris takes chances," O'Donnell said. "He walks out there doing something 
quite odd, and some people say, 'I do not like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell said that he was just reading a letter from a woman in Illinois, who 
"went on and on about how she didn't really like Letterman but could tolerate 
him, couldn't stand Paul Shaffer, and was sure she could never like Chris, 
because he was so ego-maniacal, self-centered, piggish . . . " 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell calls Elliott "extremely brave" for playing the characters he does. 
"To the average TV viewer, he seems to be this reptilian self-promoter," he 
said. 'He's not shy about making himself look horrible and reprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Andy Kaufman, the late comedian-performance artist to whom he is 
often compared, Chris Elliott has no interest in staying in character to the 
point that the edges of the real man get fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
Once they've stepped out of character on their quasi-pseudo-parody of a 
publicity tour, the father and son are so normal that it takes a moment to 
realize they aren't playing the sort of low-key characters that Elliott Sr. 
made famous -- newsman Wally Ballou, for instance, or Harlow P. Whitcomb, 
president of the Slow Talkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Men 
</P>
<P>
And as the bald and balding look-alikes talk, laugh and drape their arms over 
each other's shoulders, it's obvious that the book's bitter premise is 
nonsense. "We're both really family men," said Chris, who is now the doting 
father of a 2-year-old daughter, Abigail. 
</P>
<P>
To research "Daddy's Boy," Chris read several celebrity-offspring 
autobiographies including "Mommy Dearest," he said. But in writing his parody 
of the form, he did draw from his life. 
</P>
<P>
"He's remembered so many little details," Bob said, as he and his son sat by 
the swimming pool at the Beverly Hilton, eating club sandwiches and behaving 
very un-celebrity-like. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the father does wear Gold-Toe socks, as the book asserts. But he 
was not obsessed with them. He never "sketched lovely, life-like renderings of 
Gold-Toed socks." Nor did Chris fly into a rage during the family's allegedly 
televised Christmas interview, shouting: "No more Gold-Toe socks! Get yourself 
some help, man!" 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the father never filled a room with an alphabetically arranged 
collection of several thousand Jim Beam bottles, although he did have a few. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I've been collecting these little things," Bob said, lifting a small 
bottle of Grey Poupon mustard from the pool-side table. "I pick them up at the 
hotels." 
</P>
<P>
He's not kidding, Chris says. And he's not kidding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Travel Game 
</P>
<P>
"And the part about PXG-297 is for real," Chris added, referring to a travel 
game his father invented, based on his license number, and which, for no 
apparent reason, he explains in three pages of excruciating detail in one of 
his rebuttals. 
</P>
<P>
"He calls it a game, it's not really a game," Chris said. 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" Bob asked defensively. 
</P>
<P>
Chris paused, looking for a gentle way to say it. "It's an annoyance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That game never gets a good reaction," Bob said. 
</P>
<P>
But the family of seven -- three daughters, two sons -- did play it on their 
frequent vacations to Maine, Chris' mother, Lee, recalled in a phone 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Those trips in the family station wagon, Chris said, "were too hellish to 
remember." Mother Lee recalls them fondly. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd take a dog and two birds and a gold fish. They had to go along. The dog 
threw up, and very often he'd throw up on the bird cage. We had one daughter 
who got car-sick. Everyone let her have her favorite seat." 
</P>
<P>
Chris' wife, Paula, a former Letterman casting coordinator -- with the dubious 
distinction of having given crackpot comic Emo Philips his break -- met Elliott 
on the set and was bowled over by his charm: "He drew these horrible 
caricatures of me with a corncob pipe in my mouth and put them on my door." 
</P>
<P>
When she married into the Elliott clan, it first "reminded me of the family in 
'Franny and Zooey' -- you know, this old, established New York family with a 
lot of quirks," she said. She's since found out that while they "all have an 
appreciation for the absurd . . . they're pretty normal." 
</P>
<P>
In their "Late Night" skits, Letterman acts as if Elliott is something unseemly 
he's managed to get on the bottom of his shoe and is trying discreetly to 
scrape off. The impression is that Letterman would rather he had never been 
talked into hiring this loosest in the battery of loose cannons that guard 
"Late Night" against assault by the forces of traditional television values. 
</P>
<P>
That condescension is a thoroughly scripted part of the act, Resnick said. 
</P>
<P>
"I find him very amusing," Letterman conceded. "He has a really interesting 
view. He's doing a kind of comedy that you don't see much of anywhere. And I 
guess there's a good reason for that. It makes people sick." 
</P>
<P>
In this kinder, gentler mood, the talk show host even had a kind word for the 
book: "To be sure it's peculiar. (But) parts of it made me laugh out loud." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers might be amazed at the respect the creator of the show's least 
respectable characters gets from his other colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Evil Wicked Mimic' 
</P>
<P>
"He's an evil wicked mimic and in the Middle Ages would have been burned at the 
stake," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Lennard was sufficiently impressed with Elliott that she eventually quit 
her job as talent coordinator at "Late Night" to manage him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was blown away by him. I just knew in my gut he was special," she said. She 
compares Elliott to John Belushi and Bill Murray in their early "Saturday Night 
Live" days, sounding like too obvious a show-biz hypester for Elliott to 
parody: "He's a major talent. He's going to be a superstar." 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, Elliott has four Emmy Awards to his credit and has played fairly 
mainstream roles in several prime-time shows lately. He had a small part in the 
Francis Ford Coppola segment of "New York Stories," and a bigger role in a film 
to be released this summer called "The Abyss." And the book, Lennard said, is 
doing swell. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, though, it's hard to imagine that the mild-mannered Chris Elliott will 
ever exceed the level of celebrity that his father has achieved. 
</P>
<P>
That fame was reflected in the "L.A. in the Morning" studio, when host Edwards 
scanned the hallways before the interview and asked, "Are Ray and his son here 
yet?" 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thought Chris might ever exceed his father's fame, Letterman 
laughed the cruel laugh with which viewers are so familiar. "Oh, no, clearly 
not," he chuckled. "That's quite a long shot. No I would think not. Of course 
not. He doesn't have a chance in hell."

FATHER EDWARD SORIN CAME FROM FRANCE; 
</P>
<P>
THE MAN WHO FOUNDED NOTRE DAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SOUTH BEND, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the center of the campus of the best-known Catholic university in America is 
a larger-than-life statue of a man with a white beard that flows to his waist. 
</P>
<P>
The man is Edward F. Sorin, a Catholic priest who came to America from France 
in 1841. A year later, at age 28 and a bankroll of $300, Father Sorin founded 
the University of Notre Dame du Lac (Our Lady of the Lake). 
</P>
<P>
Sorin dedicated the university to the Blessed Virgin Mary and vowed: "When this 
school, Our Lady's school, grows a bit more, I shall raise her aloft, so that, 
without asking, all men shall know why we succeeded here. 
</P>
<P>
"To that lovely lady, raised high on a dome, a golden dome, men may look and 
find the answer." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since 1888, when Sorin's huge golden dome was erected on top of the 
school's administration building, students here have been known as the "Golden 
Domers" or simply "Domers." 
</P>
<P>
Crowned by a 19-foot-high, gold-leaf statue of Notre Dame, the Golden Dome is 
part of Sorin's legacy. And recently releafed, the Dome appears more lustrous 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Sorin served as Notre Dame's president until 1865. Then he became 
superior-general of the Congregation of Holy Cross priests who teach and 
administer the school. He was also chairman of the university's board of 
trustees and played a key role in Notre Dame's leadership until his death in 
1893. 
</P>
<P>
His imprint is everywhere on the 12,500-acre campus, including Sorin Hall, the 
school's oldest dormitory. He started the school band, one of the oldest 
university bands in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1850s, all locales with a Post Office appeared on official government 
maps. To make sure his school was on the maps, Sorin applied for -- and was 
granted -- a Post Office in 1851. Sorin was the first postmaster and Notre Dame 
has had a Post Office ever since. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan officially unveiled the Knute Rockne commemorative stamp at 
the Notre Dame Post Office on March 9, 1988 -- the first U.S. stamp ever to 
honor an athletic coach. 
</P>
<P>
Because he played "The Gipper" in the Warner Bros. 1940 movie "Knute Rockne -- 
All-American," the former President considered himself an honorary alumni. He 
delivered the commencement address here in 1981, when he and Pat O'Brien, who 
played Rockne in the film, were given honorary degrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rockne Died in Plane Crash 
</P>
<P>
Rockne, a chemistry professor, was head football coach at Notre Dame from 1918 
until he was killed in a 1931 airplane crash at 43. His teams won 105 games, 
lost 12, tied five. Five Rockne teams went undefeated, six lost one game, two 
were national champions. His lifetime winning percentage of .881 ranks at the 
top of the list for college and pro football coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Though the game put Notre Dame on the map, there is more to the campus than 
football. On a wall in school publicist Dennis Moore's office, and in many 
places on campus, is a photograph of a football and this message underneath: 
"If this is all you know about Notre Dame, you have a lot to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Ranked 18th academically among America's 204 national universities in a recent 
U.S. News and World Report survey, Notre Dame attracts more than $20 million a 
year in research funding, primarily in science and engineering. It is a 
significant figure given that university has neither a medical complex or 
agricultural school. 
</P>
<P>
The aerodynamics of glider flight and transmission of wireless messages were 
pioneered at Notre Dame. Formulas for synthetic rubber were discovered here. 
The university is a world leader in radiation chemistry and gerontological 
research. Notre Dame Press is the largest Catholic university press in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Located next to the Golden Domed Administration Building and also completed in 
1888 is the French Gothic church Sacred Heart. Designed by Sorin and Brother 
Charles Harding, Sacred Heart is patterned after the main church in Sorin's 
hometown, Aluille, France. 
</P>
<P>
Sorin maintained close ties with France and the Vatican, making 52 
transatlantic crossings in his lifetime. In 1874, during a visit to Rome, he 
convinced Pope Pius IX to grant Vatican artist-in-residence Luigi Gregori a 
two-year leave to go to Notre Dame. Gregori stayed 17 years, becoming Notre 
Dame's artist-in-residence. 
</P>
<P>
He did all the church's frescoes as well as a series of 12 paintings in the 
Administration Building depicting scenes from the life of Christopher Columbus. 
Each is 11 feet high and 5 1/2 to 9 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 92% of the students were Catholics. Co-ed since 1972, today women 
compose one-third of the student body and minorities account for 13%. Students 
come from all 50 states, and 60 countries. The 1988-89 enrollment totaled 7,500 
undergraduates, 1,300 in the graduate program and 850 in law school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once Had Own Mortuary 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had an agriculture school until 1932, when both the school and the 
campus farm were discontinued. For years, the university was self-sufficient in 
many ways. It even had its own mortuary and hearse to handle burials in the 
school cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library is the largest collegiate library 
building in the world. Hesburgh, 72, the university's 15th president, retired 
two years ago after 35 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Hesburgh was also an international leader. President Eisenhower appointed him 
to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in 1957; President Reagan sent him to El 
Salvador to oversee the elections in 1982. And Pope Pius XII sent him to Vienna 
in 1956 to represent the Vatican at the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Hesburgh's successor, the Rev. Edward "Monk" Malloy, 47, like all previous 
presidents of the school, is a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross. There 
are 405 priests in the religious order, most connected with Notre Dame. The 
president of the school is always selected from the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Malloy, who played basketball for Notre Dame on an athletic scholarship, has 
been a professor since 1974. He lives austerely in students' quarters in 
century-old Sorin Hall. He likes to tell the story of his first few months as a 
student at Notre Dame: 
</P>
<P>
"I flunked math and engineering drawing my first semester. I was .1% from 
flunking out of the university. I went on to become president of the school I 
almost flunked out of. So, there is hope. . . ."

The article Hulse wrote on Bora Bora brought back wonderful memories of our 
vacation last summer. We want to share two tips with readers who might be 
looking for a more economical way to enjoy Bora Bora and the neighboring 
islands of Raiatea and Huahine. 
</P>
<P>
Chez Pauline is a simple campsite, very popular with young Europeans and on the 
picture-perfect beach near the Marara and Moana Beach hotels. One can camp for 
about 800 francs (about $8 U.S.) per person per day, or rent a simple bungalow 
for 4,000 francs per person. Reservations need to be made well in advance, 
especially for July and August. Contact: Chez Pauline, P.O. Box 215, Vaitape, 
Bora Bora, French Polynesia. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Claude and Claudine Goche have been in the charter business in the 
Leeward Islands since 1972. Their yacht, the Danae III, has four double 
staterooms. It sails each Monday from either Huahine, Bora Bora or Raiatea on 
six-day cruises, dropping anchor in magnificent lagoons and allowing guests to 
snorkel, to explore white sandy beaches or to search for shells. Claudine 
prepares the catch each day in her tiny galley and creates gourmet dinners . . 
. for about $800 per person for six days. 
</P>
<P>
For a voyage away from tourist paths with genuine South Seas experiences, we 
recommend our friends on the Danae III as the best guides. Contact: Claude and 
Claudine Goche, Danae III, P.O. Box 251, Uturoa, Raiatea, French Polynesia.

WOULD NEVER RETURN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Hulse's article on Raiatea (May 21) was delightful, as was his piece on 
Bora Bora. We have just returned from our seventh visit to the islands. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry to disagree with his observation of the Relais Mahana. I'm certain 
that because of his position and the fact that he was with travel agent Ted 
Cook, he no doubt had royal treatment. I do not want royal treatment, but the 
charming French family was anything but. They were rude, unhelpful and 
discourteous. The rooms were small and had an extremely obnoxious odor -- we 
could not use the pillows (because) they smelled so bad. Other American 
visitors were treated poorly there also, we were told. The French guests were 
treated very well. The beach is beautiful, but I would never return.

 Editor's note: All of Jerry Hulse's expenses were paid for by the Los Angeles

YOUTH BEAT: TWO BOOKLETS CAN HELP PLAN A TRIP TO HOLLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Netherlands is helping young travelers plan budget visits by providing two 
free publications -- "Holland -- A Young and Lively Country" and "Cycling in 
Holland." 
</P>
<P>
The first provides tips and information on what to see, how to get around, 
where to stay, available entertainment and who to contact in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the least expensive accommodation for young visitors is at one of 
the young people's camping sites at Vliegenbos or Zeeburg. The fee is 5 
guilders (about $2.50 U.S.) a night. Tents can be rented at the Zeeburg camping 
site for 8 guilders a night. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet also lists youth hostels and student hotels that offer budget 
accommodations throughout the country. This year the rate for bed and breakfast 
at any of the 40 international youth hostels is 17.50 guilders a night. 
</P>
<P>
Young visitors also get special travel discounts. For example, the "Benelux 
Junior Tourrail" ticket, available to travelers aged 12 to 25, is for unlimited 
rail travel throughout the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg for any five 
days during a 17-day period. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy the pass at rail stations in three countries. A first-class ticket 
costs 148 guilders, second-class is 99 guilders. 
</P>
<P>
The publication also helps in finding services such as NBBS Travel, which has 
more than 30 offices and has been providing budget services to students and 
young travelers for more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has about 11 million bicycles and 6,200 miles of special lanes 
and paths designated specifically for cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"Cycling in Holland" offers route suggestions and maps, plus information on 
bike rentals, events and travel packages. 
</P>
<P>
In the Netherlands the wind direction is often south to southwest, so 
bicyclists can plan routes to keep it at their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Royal Dutch Touring Club (ANWB) has placed thousands of numbered, 
mushroom-shaped posts, which can be used to check locations on club maps, on 
cycling routes throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet also suggests budget accommodations such as the hundreds of log 
cabins at camping sites. The unheated cabins will accommodate up to four people 
for up to three days. Last year's rate was 42 guilders. The cabins are open 
until Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
For a free copy of either publication, contact the Netherlands Board of 
Tourism, 90 New Montgomery St., Suite 305, San Francisco 94105, (415) 543-6772. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Special rates for more than 10 kinds of youth rail tickets and passes are 
available for travel in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Spain's youth pass, Tarifa Joven, offers travelers ages 12 to 25 a 
50% discount on rail services and sleeping accommodations for a two-month 
period. Journeys must be about 65 miles, or 130 miles round trip. Price is 
2,500 pesetas (about $23 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Junior Tourrail ticket, available to travelers 12 to 25, is valid for 
unlimited travel for any five days during a 17-day period in the summer and 
over the Christmas holidays. It's sold at Belgian rail stations. The 
first-class version costs 1,800 Belgian francs ($50 U.S.), while the 
second-class ticket is 1,200 francs. 
</P>
<P>
Some tickets must be bought before you leave the United States. For example, a 
special Irish Youth Rambler Pass, valid for unlimited bus and rail travel for 
travelers under 26, must be bought through CIE Tours, 122 East 42nd St., New 
York 10168. The price for eight days is $82 U.S., 15 days is $111 and 30 days 
is $145. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to find out about special fares is to inquire at tourist 
information offices and travel agencies, or refer to guidebooks that specialize 
in youth or rail travel. 
</P>
<P>
The annual "Eurail Guide" by Marvin Saltzman ($12.95) includes prices and 
conditions for 105 low-priced train passes worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The book is available through bookstores or can be ordered from Eurail Guide, 
27540 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu 90265. The cost of $14.95 U.S. includes 
postage.

Homeowners who have repaired leaking stem-type faucets -- the kind that have 
washers -- will find the single-handle rolling ball faucet easier to repair. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be intimidated by the sleek look of your Delta or other brand faucet: 
Once you've taken it apart, it's simply a matter of replacing the worn parts 
with new ones from a kit. There are no seats to resurface or replace, as in a 
stem-type setup. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to keep the old parts in a plastic bag or other container. The 
kits have parts for various models, so there will be extra pieces in each kit. 
Just use the ones you need, referring to the old parts in that separate 
container. 
</P>
<P>
Faucet repair kits are available in hardware stores and home centers. It's 
probably best to take along the old parts, unless you know for certain what 
model faucet you have. 
</P>
<P>
Follow these steps for a painless, leak-less repair job: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shut off the water supply lines, both hot and cold. You'll find the 
shut-off valves under the sink. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With the proper size Allen (hex key) wrench, loosen the setscrew that holds 
the lever handle in place. Remove the handle by lifting it straight up. You'll 
always have an Allen wrench handy if you buy a convenient tool that has several 
sizes of wrenches hinged to fold like a pocket knife. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Unscrew the knurled cap and remove it. This cap shouldn't be too tight and 
should never be reassembled with a wrench: Finger pressure is enough. If it is 
necessary to use pliers to remove the cap, wrap the jaws of the tool with 
electrical tape to prevent marring the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pull up on the ball stem to remove the cam (a circular plastic ring with a 
rounded triangular hole in the center), the cam seal and the ball assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lift the rubber inlet seals and springs out of the faucet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If there are water leaks around the rotating spout, lift off the spout by 
jiggling it back and forth, at the same time lifting it. The leaks are caused 
by worn or broken O-rings, which are supplied in the repair kit. If the spout 
isn't leaking, you might want to leave it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Begin the repair, once you have the proper kit, by replacing the O-rings, 
if necessary, on the spout assembly and replacing the spout. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Next, insert the springs, according to the directions supplied with the 
repair kit. Usually the large end goes into the hole if the springs are 
tapered. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Install the rubber inlet seals over the springs. There's only one way to 
put them on. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reinstall the ball assembly, or a new one if you decided to buy a separate 
ball kit. It probably is a good idea to replace the ball when you replace the 
springs and seals. Make sure the rectangular groove in the ball mates with the 
alignment pin on the faucet body. Check to see that the ball moves freely in 
all directions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Replace the old cam assembly in place, making sure to install it so that a 
projection or lug in the cam mates with a notch in the faucet body. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Screw down the knurled retaining cap and tighten the adjusting ring with 
the tool supplied in the repair kit. The tool has two prongs that mate with 
notches in the adjusting ring. Don't tighten the ring too much; the ball should 
move freely. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Insert the lever handle over the ball assembly shaft and tighten the 
setscrew with the Allen wrench. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Turn on both water lines and test for leaks. The repair should give you a 
drip-free faucet for two or more years.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: KEEP HOME COOLER BY INSTALLING FOIL IN ATTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Our house is hot and I can feel the heat radiating down from the 
ceiling even though it is well-insulated. Will putting reflective foil in the 
attic help much and what is the best way to install it myself? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Putting reflective foil under your roof is one of the most effective 
methods to reduce the heat buildup in your home and cut your air-conditioning 
costs. With adequate attic ventilation, it can significantly lower the 
temperature of your ceiling. You can often feel the difference in your rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Although standard fibrous attic insulation, like fiberglass, blocks conductive 
heat loss in the winter, it is not very effective at blocking the radiant heat 
from a hot roof in the summer. The insulation itself gets warm and the heat 
comes right through into your living area. 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight aluminum foil or reinforced foil are excellent materials to use. 
The aluminum is reflective, so some of the roof's heat is reflected away from 
your ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The primary heat reduction property of aluminum is that very little heat is 
reradiated from the shiny underside to the insulation and ceiling below. With 
adequate attic ventilation, much of the heat is carried away. 
</P>
<P>
For greatest heat reduction in the summer, install the reflective foil on the 
underside of the roof rafters. This leaves an air gap above and below it, which 
is necessary for its reflective properties to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
Although it sounds strange, if you install single-sided foil (kraft paper on 
one side), face the shiny side down, away from the roof. This reduces the 
radiant heat flow to ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Some recommend just laying the foil across the top of the insulation on the 
attic floor. This may cause potential moisture problems in the insulation and 
dust on the foil surface may reduce its reflective properties. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest do-it-yourself method to apply the foil to the bottom of the roof 
rafters is with a heavy-duty stapler. Be sure to leave adequate gaps for 
ventilation at the edges. Start it on the rafters several inches above the 
insulation and leave a several-inch-wide gap at the peak of the roof. 
</P>
<P>
There are many manufacturers and types of reflective foils and the prices vary 
from a low of about 13 cents per square foot to several times that much. Make 
sure to get a material that is strong enough to hold up. It can be just 
heavyweight foil, or be reinforced with film or fibers. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 070, showing a list of 
manufacturers of reflective foils, instructions and diagrams for installing it 
yourself, and a small sample piece of reflective foil. Please include $1 and a 
self-addressed envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles 
Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. 
</P>

<P>
No Matter How Sliced, Toast Energy the Same 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a large family and I was wondering if it is more energy efficient to 
use a two-slice or a four-slice toaster in the morning? They really eat a lot 
of toast. 
</P>
<P>
A: With most kitchen appliances, it is better to make larger quantities of 
foods at one time. However, toasters are an exception. It doesn't really make 
much difference other than the fights over the first few slices. 
</P>
<P>
Toasters brown the bread with radiant heat from the red-hot elements instead of 
cooking or baking it. Therefore, the residual heat in the toaster from adjacent 
slots does not toast the bread any faster. 
</P>
<P>
Letters and questions to Dulley, a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant, may 
be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, 
Ohio 45244.

HOUSING STARTS: BEHIND THE GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lusk Co. has announced plans for a $48-million residential neighborhood on 
21.5 acres within the Calabasas Park community. 
</P>
<P>
Palatino at Calabasas Park will consist of 120 detached patio homes behind 
private gates and situated on the hills above the 18-hole Calabasas Park 
Country Club. The two-story homes in the first phase will be priced in the low 
$400,000s. Sales are scheduled to start in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Information Center 
</P>
<P>
Construction has begun on a $1.5-million dome-topped Spanish-classical

The 1,600-acre Rancho del Rey is being developed by McMillin Communities and 
Home Capital Development Group, a unit of Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Located north of East H Street between Otay Lakes Road and Interstate 805, the 
community will eventually have about 4,000 houses and a business park. First 
houses are expected to be started in August, according to a spokesman for 
McMillin Realty, the marketing agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senior Citizen Project 
</P>
<P>
Construction has begun on Morningside of Fullerton, a $75-million community for 
senior citizens at Brea Boulevard and Bastanchury Road in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
When completed in late 1992, the 41-acre project will provide 338 apartments 
and villas for healthy seniors, a 99-bed skilled nursing facility and a 44-unit 
complex for older people needing special medical care. The project is being 
developed by CoreCare, a group of Fullerton-area residents and physicians who 
have have built similar projects in the past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rentals for Seniors 
</P>

east side of Petit Avenue in eastern Ventura. Completion is expected in about 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army of Southern California is the owner-developer of the 
$4.3-million project, funded with a Section 202/8 senior housing mortgage from 
the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Tenants will pay 30% 
of their monthly income for rent -- usually much less than the posted $717-$838 
monthly rents for the studio and one-bedroom units, according to a Silvercrest 
Residence spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kern County Houses

Three floor plans will be available, ranging from about 1,600 to about 2,000 
square feet. The two- and three-bedroom, two-level units in the development 
near Kanan and Lindero Canyon roads will sell from about $350,000 to about 
$390,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gated Community 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo is getting its first gated estate community, Bella Vista, in the Las 
Posas section of the Ventura County city. Prices for lots in the 64-site 
project range from $380,000 to $425,000 and are a minimum of one acre. 
</P>
<P>
The community at 6500 Beardsley Road is a joint venture of Parton Edwards

agent. One-story houses must have at least 3,000 square feet, while two-story 
ones must have at least 3,500 square feet. Designs must be approved by an 
architectural control committee. A Bella Vista display is at the Jon Douglas 
office at 1775 Daily Drive, Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
September Sales 
</P>

LIKE HEAT, MAJOR SPEECH BY DENG ENVELOPS BEIJING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>
<P>
BEIJING 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The whole country has been ordered to read a Chinese document called the 
Important Speech of Deng Xiaoping, but on this summer-like Saturday in Beijing, 
hardly anyone seemed in a hurry to start. 
</P>
<P>
And, if they wanted to read it, no one knew where to get a copy. 
</P>
<P>
Even newly formed municipal work brigades that surfaced to help clean up debris 
left over from the June 3-4 Tian An Men Square violence could be seen reading 
kung fu novels, movie magazines, almost everything but a political document. 
</P>
<P>
The weather -- Beijing residents generally dislike heat -- far outstripped 
politics as the topic of choice for conversation. The 85-degree temperature 
seemed a safer subject than unpleasant events in uncertain times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about politics," said a customer at the outdoor Fashion 
Sweater and Popsicle Store near Qianmen, the front gate of the city when Old 
Beijing was walled. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very hard to understand," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
But the customer, who was buying a Popsicle rather than a sweater, knew 
something was coming. It would be hard not to, for the campaign to prepare 
everyone to read this particular speech has taken over newspapers and the 
airwaves, not to mention walls and railings on the street where banners herald 
the coming of a new political line. 
</P>
<P>
The Important Speech -- that's what newspapers and television here call it -- 
was made by Deng, China's paramount leader, several days ago in a closed 
meeting. Foreign observers and citizens alike predict that most Chinese will be 
called to meetings in their workplaces and neighborhoods to become familiar 
with Deng's every word. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that in a day or two, my boss will ask us all to listen to the 
speech. We will learn all about it," said Bai, a souvenir salesman at the 
Summer Palace, once a Qing Dynasty royal retreat on the outskirts of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the common people seem not to have seen the speech, there is 
already basic instruction available on television giving hints on how to react 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two nights, news programs showed groups of Communist politicians 
and officials reading the document. A camera panned slowly from face to face as 
each reader dutifully jotted notes and every once in a while nodded in 
agreement with some point. 
</P>
<P>
One official or another could be heard praising the speech as "well written," 
or damning student protesters as "counterrevolutionary rioters." 
</P>
<P>
For anyone who missed these reports, the newspapers repeat much the same items. 
The People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, featured an article 
Saturday headlined "The capital's leading scientists study in an informal 
discussion group and conclude that Deng Xiaoping's speech conveys the people's 
wishes." 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Daily advised everyone to "resolutely read Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
Important Speech." The China Youth News said that "the chairman and vice 
chairman of the All-China Youth Federation held a meeting to discuss Deng 
Xiaoping's illustrious speech." In a preview earlier last week, the People's 
Daily gave an outline of the content of the speech. 
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Deng defended the assault by soldiers on demonstrators in Tian 
An Men Square, and his tone on this subject is fairly harsh. According to the 
newspaper, the pro-democracy demonstrators were an "ideological pimple" that is 
being "lanced by Deng Xiaoping's words." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 Central Position, 2 Points 
</P>
<P>
The aging leader's speech also urged upholding of the "one central position and 
two basic points." This is a bit confusing to some Chinese, because the "one 
central position" is their impression of the "four basic principals" -- 
upholding the leadership of the Communist Party, upholding socialism, upholding 
the people's democratic dictatorship and Mao Tse-tung Thought. 
</P>
<P>
Mao, who once condemned Deng as a "capitalist roader" trying to overturn 
Marxism, has been dead for 13 years. Many of his ideas have been discredited, 
and his thought is only selectively upheld. 
</P>
<P>
The two basic points are reform, which means continued decentralization of the 
economy, and openness, which means maintaining trade and contact with the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Try as one might, it is hard to escape politics these days. The news programs 
on television have been lengthened and are shown four or five times a day. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, the rundown of national news ran like this: 
</P>
<P>
First, a group of men representing "democratic parties," which in China are 
docile skeletons of political movements that have long since dried up, were 
shown reading the Important Speech. 
</P>
<P>
The scene switched to children standing at attention on Tian An Men Square. The 
children pledged to study harder in memory of soldiers who died putting down 
the student demonstrators and their supporters. Tethered red and white 
helium-filled balloons carried aloft banners that read, "Long live the 
Communist Party!" 
</P>
<P>
For the third night in a row, pictures of crews cleaning and scrubbing the 
square were shown. Next came a typical series showing troops engaged in various 
martial-law activities: They stand rigid on street corners, keeping watch on 
the city; they water plants at the Temple of Heaven; they attend memorial 
services for fallen comrades. 
</P>
<P>
There was a letter describing the People's Liberation Army, which killed 
hundreds of demonstrators, as "lovable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Businessmen 
</P>
<P>
Finally, foreign businessmen who stayed in China through all of the turmoil 
were put on the air as a display of how normal things are. One Swedish 
businessman concluded a deal to run tours to the Great Wall. He exclaimed: 
"Afraid? What's there to be afraid of?" 
</P>
<P>
It has been more than a decade since the government mounted such an 
all-encompassing political campaign. Some of the harsher rhetoric reminds many 
observers of the chaotic days of the Cultural Revolution, which gripped the 
country for the better part of 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the People's Daily published an account of a report it said was 
telephoned in by pro-democracy students. The unnamed students supported the 
government's decision to expel two American journalists last week. 
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the students called the reporters "gods of plague . 
. . who manipulated our hopes for more democratization." 
</P>
<P>
"They used our hot-blooded patriotism to urge us to block cars, beat, smash and 
loot, fire guns and kill," the newspaper quoted the students as saying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time to 'Disinfect China' 
</P>
<P>
The report concluded: "Now it is time to expel them and disinfect China of this 
plague." 
</P>
<P>
Fang Lizhi, the dissident scientist who has taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy, 
came in for his share of abuse. One letter published in the official press 
referred to him as the "scum of the Chinese nation."

<P>
The purple scar that cuts across Carmen Zalpa's nose and under her left eye has 
become a badge of courage for the Indian woman who heads a village committee in 
support of leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
Zalpa was hit in the face by a brick last month during a confrontation with 
police who were escorting the ruling party's candidate for the state assembly 
on a campaign swing through her village of Acachuen. 
</P>
<P>
To protest the incident, Zalpa and dozens of other peasants have occupied the 
city hall in this rural town in the state of Michoacan and have built stone 
barricades in the streets to prevent the police from evicting them. They are 
demanding the dismissal of the Institutional Revolutionary Party mayor, local 
justice officials and the six-member local police force, and are calling for 
honest state assembly elections July 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, it was joy that made me a Cardenista. Now it is anger," Zalpa said. 
"We will vote legally next month, and we will win. If not, we are willing to 
die here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test for Salinas 
</P>
<P>
Although the election is for the traditionally powerless state legislature, it 
has taken on national importance as a test for President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's commitment to democracy and political reform. It is one of three 
hotly contested state elections that will be held on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
In Baja California, the PRI, as the ruling party is called, faces stiff 
competition in the gubernatorial race from the rightist National Action Party, 
whose candidate, a popular former mayor of Ensenada, is tied with the PRI 
candidate in the polls. In its 60 years, the PRI has never lost an election for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal and legislative elections also will take place in the state of 
Chihuahua, another stronghold of the National Action Party, called by its 
Spanish initials, PAN. The right-wing party held seven mayoralties there from 
1983 to 1986, including Ciudad Juarez on the border and Chihuahua City, the 
state capital. These cities as well as the governorship were claimed by the PRI 
in 1986 elections that the PAN charged were fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
But while all three state races are expected to be close, it is in Michoacan 
that the PRI may face its toughest challenge to maintain order and the 
legitimacy of the election. Here, the name Cardenas is nearly sacred and the 
Cardenistas are militant. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas' father, Gen. Lazaro Cardenas, was one of the country's most beloved 
presidents. He is regarded as a national hero for expropriating the nation's 
oil industry in the 1930s. After his term, the general returned home and, for 
the next 30 years, acted as benefactor, channeling demands of the poor to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was a popular governor of this Indian farming state before 
he broke with the ruling party to run for president last July. Many of the 
peasants note proudly that Cardenas has dark skin, as they do. 
</P>
<P>
In the presidential election, Cardenas won 64% of the vote in Michoacan. His 
coalition of parties took 12 of the state's 13 seats in the lower house of the 
federal legislature, an unprecedented opposition victory. 
</P>
<P>
With their new-found strength, Cardenas' supporters occupied more than 50 city 
halls last fall to demand the removal of Michoacan Gov. Luis Martinez 
Villacana. Martinez Villacana, who followed Cardenas into office, has fired 
hundreds of Cardenas supporters from state government posts and overturned many 
of his policies. Ironically, many Cardenas policies, such as a ban on weekend 
liquor sales, were unpopular until the new governor reversed them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removed 2 Governors 
</P>
<P>
Among Salinas' first acts as president was the removal of Martinez Villacana, 
along with the equally disliked governor of Baja California, Xicotencatl Leyva 
Mortera. Although the latter's term is up this year, the Michoacan term has two 
years to run. The PRI-dominated state legislature named Genovevo Figueroa as 
interim governor but, theoretically, a new legislature with a Cardenista 
majority could appoint a governor to complete the term. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI, therefore, is running hard in the race for 18 legislative seats, and 
it is campaigning from the awkward position of both incumbent party and 
opposition. National PRI President Luis Donaldo Colosio has made five trips to 
Michoacan and plans another before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dedicating three days a week to these elections (in Baja California and 
Michoacan) and the other three days to the rest of the country," Colosio said. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI moved from its old offices in downtown Morelia, the capital of 
Michoacan, to four floors of a modern high-rise building that also houses the 
federal secretaries of treasury and budget and planning. The party has set up 
an elaborate campaign structure with 26 departments, including ecology and 
sports. The national party has sent in dozens of campaign workers, several of 
whom expect to remain through mayoral elections scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Among the Poorest States 
</P>
<P>
Michoacan, west of Mexico City, is among the poorest of the nation's 31 states 
and is a primary source of illegal immigrants in the United States. Mexico's 
ailing economy can only work against the PRI in the legislative election, as it 
did last July. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, interim Gov. Figueroa and federal authorities announced a 
multimillion-dollar development plan for the state. It is not clear how much of 
the money has been forthcoming, although several highways have been repaved 
recently and at least a few other long-promised public works projects have been 
started. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties charge that the PRI uses such government programs before 
elections to win support for the party. Cardenas supporters say the government 
promised more than it could deliver in the Michoacan plan, and so it may 
backfire. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardenistas have problems of their own. The coalition of four parties that 
backed Cardenas for president has since fallen apart, and Cardenas has formed 
his own party, the Revolutionary Democratic Party. Cardenas is not a candidate. 
Not only does his new party lack name recognition, but one of the old parties 
that split with Cardenas also bears his famous last name. The party that 
delivered the most votes to Cardenas last July has its own slate of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Political analyst Jorge Zepeda Patterson, a university researcher in Zamora, 
Michoacan, said that many urban voters who cast ballots for Cardenas last July 
did so as a protest against the PRI and not necessarily in support of Cardenas' 
policies. Those protest votes do not automatically translate into backing for 
Cardenista candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The government and Cardenas' party both charge that the other has been 
fomenting violence to frighten voters away from the polls. Michoacan 
traditionally has suffered a high level of violence involving land disputes and 
marijuana trafficking, but in the last year there has also been political 
violence between the PRI and the Cardenistas. 
</P>
<P>
In such confrontations, one person was killed and three others were wounded in 
the town of Charapan, four were wounded in Mirandillas, the PRI municipal 
president was stoned in Maravatio and eight Cardenistas, including Carmen 
Zalpa, were wounded in Acachuen. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenistas are still holding at least a dozen city halls to demand, in most 
cases, a new municipal president, or mayor. In several towns, among them 
Cheran, they have set up parallel governments. 
</P>
<P>
Cheran's "Mayor Elected by the People," Adalberto Munoz Estrada, occupies the 
first floor of the town hall and presides over public celebrations, such as 
those on Cinco de Mayo. The "Mayor Elected by the Congress," Manuel Sta. Clara, 
works at home signing official documents. 
</P>
<P>
The state government apparently has decided against using force to evict the 
Cardenistas from the town halls. Sta. Clara said that congress initially 
advised him to stay in his house and avoid provoking the opposition. He said he 
did not go out for two months after the state named him to replace another 
unpopular mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In Chilchota, Cardenas supporters say they were attacked by the municipal 
police force that accompanied PRI legislative candidate Ramiro Pena Diaz to 
Acachuen last month. Pena Diaz has charged that his group was attacked by the 
Cardenistas and that the police intervened. 
</P>
<P>
There is some question about how much control Cardenas and his national party 
exercise over local supporters. The PRI insists that Cardenas could order his 
people out of the town halls; Cardenista federal deputies from Michoacan say 
that the people made the decision to take over town halls on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The other looming question is whether the PRI government would be willing to 
recognize a Cardenista majority in the state legislature. The ruling party has 
long been accused of stealing elections. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas, who the opposition claims won through fraudulent elections, has 
committed himself to fair and open voting. Analysts argue that Michoacan would 
not be a threat if the PRI lost it because it is not vital to the country's 
economy or national security. Moreover, an opposition congress, especially with 
the PRI governor, could be an experiment for Salinas' goals of political 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Salinas and the PRI have an aversion to Cardenas, whom they 
view as a traitor for leaving the ruling party elite, called the Revolutionary 
Family. Cardenas continues to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Salinas, and the 
PRI is said to fear giving him a statewide power base. 
</P>
<P>
But the cost of fraudulent elections could be high. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very possible that electoral fraud could unleash violence that not even 
the Cardenista leaders could stop," Zepeda Patterson, the university 
researcher, said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the PRI were to win fairly a majority of the legislative seats, many of 
the poor and semi-literate Cardenas supporters are not likely to believe it. 
They do not trust the PRI government.

By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer Staff writer Allan Parachini covered the 
Woodstock Music &amp; Art Fair and events leading up to it throughout the 
summer of 1969, for United Press International. Ten years ago, he reported for 
The Times on perceptions of Woodstock a decade after it occurred.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walking tentatively, as if entering a shrine, four young men wandered into the 
large, sloping hayfield on a little country lane called Hurd Road, a few miles 
from this Catskill Mountain village 90 miles northwest of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, three of them sat down in the grass and chuckled as the fourth, a 
16-year-old high school student, played the air as if it were a guitar, 
imitating the stereotyped choreography of rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy enough to find the hayfield, but it no longer has any resemblance to 
the form it took for three days in the late summer of 1969. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spot Where Stage Stood 
</P>
<P>
Unaware of his precise location in the field until a stranger told him, 
16-year-old Mike Gore, of Dudley, Mass., had mimed his guitar licks at 
precisely the spot where, 20 years ago this summer, on Aug. 15, 16 and 17, the 
stage was positioned before an audience of somewhere between 350,000 and 
750,000 people -- no one will ever know how many -- for the high-water mark of 
what today seems another age. 
</P>
<P>
Woodstock. More properly, the Woodstock Music &amp; Art Fair . . . An Aquarian 
Exposition . . . Three Days of Peace and Music. An event that defined its time 
and affected a generation. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, Woodstock's lasting imprint on America remains controversial 
-- studied, debated, misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, some say, it was just a wonderful party, held at a point when so much 
seemed possible. A party so memorable that some people mistakenly believed its 
radiated effects would change the world. The more cynical argue that such 
thinking was a mirage. The party's real legacy, they say, became the drug 
epidemic and the self-centered "Me" generation. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, say the social ferment identified with the Woodstock era ended 
the Vietnam War and that the activism with which the 1960s are identified 
ushered in the women's and environmental movements -- an ongoing legacy that 
shines brighter than the festival's flamboyance. 
</P>
<P>
What seems clear, after two decades, is that Woodstock's hold on the 
imagination remains strong enough to lure teen-agers who were not even born in 
1969 and who seem indifferent to many of the social and political values it 
espoused. And its sway still proves strong -- if wistfully so -- for the 
generation that lived it but watched things turn out differently than they 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco rock promoter Bill Graham recalls not fully realizing the 
magnitude of Woodstock until Janis Joplin -- drunk and destined to deliver a 
second-rate performance -- walked on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"She just walked out into that Nuremberg roar," Graham recalled, "I was 
standing on the side of the stage," Graham said, "(and I asked myself) 'What is 
that?' Everyone realized, 'my God . . . what does it stand for?"' 
</P>
<P>
"I think Woodstock represents a dream," said Lee Blumer, who worked on the 
festival's security staff in 1969. Today, she is an executive with a production 
company owned by Mike Lang, who as a 24-year-old hippie conceived the idea for 
Woodstock and served as the festival's producer. 
</P>
<P>
"The Woodstock festival," Blumer said one day recently in Lang's comfortable 
loft office in the SoHo district of Manhattan, "moved the consciousness of a 
whole generation. It may have been less than one degree, but it moved it." 
</P>
<P>
Lang, who now runs Better Music and maintains a country house in Woodstock, 
N.Y., itself, has never lost the hippie sincerity that somehow made the 
Woodstock festival happen despite the longest conceivable odds. "I think that 
what Woodstock probably did was confirm a lot of positions people were taking 
in the '60s and confirmed that there were lots more people who were of the same 
mind," Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was far more complex than just Woodstock. Most observers agree 
the era defined as the 1960s extends from the assassination of President John 
F. Kennedy in 1963 through the U.S. incursion into Cambodia early in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the decade, the pace of events was so rapid the time line blurs. 
In late 1969 alone, for instance, Woodstock was immediately preceded by rioting 
in Berkeley's People's Park and immediately followed by the Rolling Stones 
concert at Altamont, Calif., in which Hells Angels beat a black spectator to 
death. The next April, National Guardsmen opened fire on students at Kent State 
University in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
While Woodstock was, in a sense, studiously nonpolitical, some observers 
believe it made a forcefully political statement because a half million people 
of like ideals had just shown up. 
</P>
<P>
John McDargh, a Boston College theology professor, believes Woodstock to have 
been what theologians call a kairotic moment, one that is unique and cannot be 
repeated. Since this was so, McDargh contended, today's young people not only 
can't identify with its values but have come to distrust members of what Abbie 
Hoffman dubbed "the Woodstock Nation." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a funny sort of mixed, ambivalent nostalgia," McDargh said of today's 
perceptions of Woodstock. "A great many students have this image that everybody 
(from the Woodstock era) has ended up as in (the 1983 motion picture) 'The Big 
Chill.' Their feeling is, if you try to stay faithful to your ideals, you're 
dead, or your brain is fried or you sold out. The way it affects them is: 'If I 
get committed, won't I be left looking foolish and alone?' " 
</P>
<P>
Even observers who credit Woodstock with permanently changing American life are 
troubled by similar perceptions. Ann Kaplan, an English professor and director 
of the Humanities Institute at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, 
said the feminist movement that sprang up in the 1960s is likely to remain a 
key element of the era Woodstock symbolizes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death of Abbie Hoffman 
</P>
<P>
But Kaplan is also troubled by a contrary legacy symbolized, she said, by the 
drug-related suicide last April of '60s radical Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
"Abbie Hoffman's death affected me greatly," she said, "because he was a symbol 
(of the Woodstock era). I just was convinced that he looked at the 1980s and 
said: 'This is no world for me to live in.' " 
</P>
<P>
To Carol Petillo, a historian who teaches a popular course on the '60s at 
Boston College, Hoffman's death poses troubling problems of communicating to 
today's young the themes that Woodstock came to represent. "They will see (the 
suicide) as a cop-out," she said, "or that the bastards finally ground him 
down." 
</P>
<P>
To academics like Petillo and McDargh, the legacy of Woodstock for today's 
teen-agers and young adults is almost schizophrenic. Its memories are of 
excesses such as drugs, tempered by the realization that something captivating 
was happening then that isn't happening now. 
</P>
<P>
Like the four young men in the hayfield, Woodstock represents an era today's 
young people seem to long for but don't know why. They have embraced 
Woodstock's music, but without knowing the social and cultural context that 
produced it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if they (today's young people) missed out on something," McDargh said. 
"They all know the 1960s music, but it's not their music. On the other hand, 
there is a kind of rejection. Kids will say: 'I would never demonstrate. That's 
so '60s.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, who had gained national note the year before Woodstock as a leader of 
demonstrations at the Chicago Democratic convention, addressed issues of 
Woodstock's connection to today's young people with author Joel Makower, whose 
book "Woodstock: The Oral History" is to be published by Doubleday in July. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman was a major Woodstock figure because, when he tried to seize the 
microphone to make a political speech, Pete Townshend of the rock group the Who 
kicked him off the stage. He spent the rest of the festival acting, with 
striking effectiveness, as administrator of a first-aid tent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad because it (the life style and values of the Woodstock generation) 
isn't going on today," Hoffman told Makower, "because it's part of the past . . 
. because youth makes revolution, youth makes social change. The question is 
not: 'What happened to those of us who went to Woodstock?' It's: 'Where's the 
Woodstock for today's generation?' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Terrible Being Young Today' 
</P>
<P>
"My kid, who's 16 . . . calls me up and he says: 'Daddy, why wasn't I born in 
the '60s?' And what can I say? 'You're right. You should have been born (then). 
It's terrible being young today.' " 
</P>
<P>
A hayfield in which so many young people gathered so happily 20 years ago, 
proved unexpectedly to have excellent acoustics. Today, it is unchanged from 
that weekend, when it became the site of a happening that defied heavy rains, 
tainted LSD and food and sanitary facility shortages to show that, at least for 
a weekend, peaceful coexistence was possible. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the field, dairy farmer Max Yasgur, became a folk hero just for 
hosting Woodstock. The current owners, who bought the field from Yasgur's 
estate, have erected a concrete monument. 
</P>
<P>
For three days, it has been often said, Woodstock was the third-largest city in 
New York. Its population was roughly equivalent to the American troop 
commitment in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Jim DeVoe was 19, enjoying the summer after his sophomore year at the 
University of Notre Dame. He had decided to declare theology as his major. He 
was struggling to rationalize his enrollment in Air Force ROTC -- a choice made 
under pressure from his father, an Air Force colonel. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived at the festival on Friday night, after the music and the first of 
two torrential storms had begun. "We wound up sharing a tent with two or three 
girls," DeVoe recalled. "The music was on. I remember it being Janis Joplin." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Link to Specific Tune 
</P>
<P>
DeVoe decided to attend Woodstock because of its music. But as he sat in the 
crowd listening to singer Country Joe McDonald, he realized that Woodstock was 
changing him in ways he never anticipated. He even links it to a specific tune, 
"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixing-to-Die-Rag," an anti-Vietnam song. 
</P>
<P>
"The deeper issues -- the relationship between the university and society and 
the individual and political obligations -- began to germinate," DeVoe said. "I 
would say it crystallized at Woodstock, around Country Joe." 
</P>
<P>
That fall, DeVoe began to pull back from ROTC. When rioting broke out on 
campuses after the U.S. incursion into Cambodia, he refused to lead his platoon 
onto the parade field. At the end of the school year, he dropped ROTC and 
became a conscientious objector. 
</P>
<P>
He took to the streets of South Bend to oppose the war. His activism continued 
through his conscientious observer service as a parochial high school teacher. 
But 20 years later, DeVoe is symptomatic of the graying of the Woodstock 
Nation. 
</P>
<P>
He is district manager for college textbook sales of a major publishing 
company, based in Princeton, N.J. He wears a suit to work, drives a station 
wagon -- though the tape player is loaded with the Rolling Stones and other 
1960s music -- and lives in the suburbs with his wife and children. It's such a 
turnabout it almost amuses him. 
</P>
<P>
DeVoe accepts it, although he laments it. "I have to have an income. I have to 
support my family. I have to be financially prepared to deal with a college 
education for my children." 
</P>
<P>
There is more than a symbolic encroachment today around the edges of 
Woodstock's central shrine. Along one end of Filippini Pond, the little body of 
water where thousands skinny-dipped in 1969, luxury homes rise, fetching as 
much as $325,000. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, a local speculator bought up the land on the far side of 
Filippini Pond and opened the Woodstock on the Lake Campground. Across Hurd 
Road from the pond -- on a gentle slope where, during Woodstock, young people 
ran naked, smoked marijuana and pitched brightly colored tents -- there is a 
subdivision with three luxury homes completed. Late last year, Richard Desmond 
moved into one of them -- a house on a slight rise from whose Jacuzzi deck it 
would have been possible to see the top of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The house's proximity to the center of Woodstock was its key attraction to 
Desmond, 42. He didn't attend, though he lived in nearby Monticello at the 
time. He didn't realize the import of that August weekend until traffic jams 
stretching 20 miles in every direction made access nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still Feel Good About It' 
</P>
<P>
"We had 400,000 neighbors there not too long ago," he said one day recently, 
standing on the deck and gesturing toward the hayfield. "Twenty years later, I 
can still feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
Woodstock, of course, was not held in Woodstock, N.Y., though it had originally 
been intended to be there. As the summer wore on, two different sites evicted 
the festival and it landed in the hayfield only weeks before opening day. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1969, Nick Langhart was 25 and avoiding the draft, working at a 
community college in Ohio, when his brother, Chris, a Woodstock technical 
supervisor, summoned him to the site. 
</P>
<P>
Langhart, now a museum curator near Boston, supervised a crew installing water 
pipes. "People in the crowd were totally trusting. That made me (think at 
first) that Woodstock was an apparent consensus of values, an apparent new 
age," Langhart said. "But when it came down to issues that affected 
individuals, they were as different (at Woodstock) as they had been before or 
would be five years later." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Meaning to Symbol 
</P>
<P>
Such recollections are the raw material of the work of Rebecca Klatch, a UC 
Santa Cruz sociology professor on a fellowship to study 1960s politics at the 
Stanford Humanities Center. Woodstock, she said, "has become a symbol, and one 
of the interesting parts is that it's acquired more meaning over the last two 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
"There is some amount of debate in the scholarship of the '60s of the cultural 
versus the political aspects (of the decade). To me, Woodstock is the positive 
way in which that culture and politics blended." 
</P>
<P>
Klatch, a high school student in Skokie, Ill., at the time of Woodstock, agrees 
that many students today seem drawn to Woodstock -- finding in its music, in 
particular, an allure as strong now as then. It is no accident, she argued, 
that fully half of the music acts that played Woodstock -- or at least their 
key personnel -- are still actively performing and successfully finding an 
audience in the same age bracket that camped out at Woodstock in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Klatch said scholars are finding some modern-day cliches inaccurate. Three 
recent studies, for instance, have found that people who were politically 
active in the 1960s have remained committed to the causes in which they were 
then passionately involved. This scholarship, she said, invalidates impressions 
of many young people that people who were young adults 20 years ago have all 
sold out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rubin Became Broker 
</P>
<P>
She calls this belief the "Jerry Rubin factor," after the transformation of one 
of the mainstays of 1960s activism into a life as a stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, observed Todd Gitlin, a UC Berkeley sociologist, it is 
very important not to lose sight of one reality: "There ain't no revolution I 
can see." 
</P>
<P>
Woodstock, he said, "has a very murky legacy. I think that a lot of people of 
my vintage felt in the late '60s that we were trembling on the edge of some 
incomprehensible transformation of human consciousness that was either upon us 
or damned well better be. Then, inevitably, we were tremendously disappointed, 
or worse, that it didn't happen. " 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1969, Andrea Hyde was a law student at St. John's University 
in New York. Her friend, Gene Cimini, had just returned to Manhattan after a 
year off from law school and was driving a cab. 
</P>
<P>
With two other friends, they decided to attend Woodstock, Hyde recalled one day 
recently as she sat in the conference room of her Mineola, N.Y., law office. 
"As each day progressed through that summer, one more group was going to be 
there until it seemed as if everyone was going to be there," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
And so they all piled in a car and headed to Woodstock. When Woodstock's fabled 
rains soaked them, the little group found a self-service laundry and stuck 
everything they had in dryers. After the sun broke through on the Saturday of 
the festival, they sat that night through "three or four of the best hours of 
music ever," said Cimini, who now practices law in Garden City, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Cimini recalls Woodstock as strangely harmonious. "Next to us was a bunch of 
people who looked like they just came from the country club, with plaid pants 
and a picnic basket," he chuckled. "In front of us were a bunch of bikers who 
drank more Jack Daniel's than I thought was possible." 
</P>
<P>
But before they had left for home the next day, Woodstock had begun to cast its 
broader spell on them. "One of the last things that happened as we were leaving 
is somebody gave us a flyer. It said: 'Come to Chicago.' " The event, the 
Weatherman-organized Days of Rage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," said Hyde reflectively, "this mass of people coming of age at the 
same time and coming to grips with the political situation. I just always had 
the sense that we were part of something very big. I didn't know how (it) would 
play itself out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Ripples Observed 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, what actually happened is not entirely satisfactory to the 
two middle-age lawyers. Looking for Woodstock's remaining ripples, Cimini and 
Hyde -- like many Woodstock people -- see little, if anything. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like something died five or 10 years ago," Cimini said. "A lot of us 
got politically involved, and, if history is kind to us, we did a good thing. 
But there were some really bad effects. A lot of (permanently harmed) kids came 
home from Vietnam. The drug thing ran out of control. But Woodstock served to 
separate us, and that separateness still exists." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin Unger, a New York University historian who last year co-authored a book 
arguing that 1968 -- the year before Woodstock -- was the decade's most 
significant turning point, agrees that much of what happened in the '60s -- 
alternative politics and counterculture, which Unger is careful to separate -- 
was based on simply false perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the '60s represented a unique event attached to the premature belief 
in permanent prosperity," Unger said. "For the first time, a few countries in 
the West (appeared for the moment to have) achieved a kind of new stage where 
man had been liberated from the goad of necessity and now had to basically turn 
their attention to more critical things -- like human relations, injustice, the 
existential things." 
</P>
<P>
Unger argues that Woodstock achieved the prominence it did -- and is now 
receding in influence -- simply because of the population cycle of the 
post-World War II baby boom. Between 1960 and 1970, the number of young people 
ages 18 to 24 increased by more than 50%, to 24.7 million the year after 
Woodstock. The age group zoomed from 8.9% of the population in 1960 to 13.3% in 
1980. By 1985, the percentage was down to 12% -- less than during Woodstock. By 
1995, it will be 9.3% and dropping. 
</P>
<P>
"A great deal of what went on was pushing the agenda of the young," he said. 
"It's just now that there are signs of the tide receding." 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in his attic in Summerville, Mass., Peter Sosna still keeps a copy of 
the Woodstock commemorative issue of Life magazine. In the middle of a two-page 
photograph of the crowd that ran inside the cover, he appears as a speck in 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
At 15, he lobbied his parents to let him go to Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Woodstock crowd has gone on to professional careers, had children 
and bought turbo Volvos with cellular telephones. But Sosna has stayed in the 
1960s, as if he volunteered for time warp research. He makes his living as a 
magician. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still True to '60s 
</P>
<P>
His friends are unreconstructed longhairs. True to the '60s, he has his 
apartment, a stereo and a car and requires little else. His concessions to time 
are few. "I stopped doing LSD a long time ago," he said, "not because of any 
unpleasant experience, but I figured something that is this much fun has got to 
be really bad for you. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more than just a party, but it was quite a party," he recalled of 
Woodstock. "It was the best weekend of my life. I felt kind of justified in the 
beliefs that I had . . . all that peace and love stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was kind of a lesson we were trying to teach America that never 
really sank in."

UTAH ARCHITECT PURSUES DREAM: A LOW-SALT LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SALT LAKE CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don David Johnson, free-lance architect and relentless visionary, may yet 
realize his peculiar dream of turning much of the Great Salt Lake into an 
immense freshwater reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"What I see," said Johnson recently, "is the opportunity now to create a life 
style that is enjoyed in California and Florida . . . a water-based life 
style." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson imagines marina-style housing tracts with a boat dock in every back 
yard, tree-lined causeways for a Sunday driver's scenic loop around the lake's 
islands, water skiing, beaches, hotels and, not least, tourists spending freely 
in the thrall of mighty sunsets. 
</P>
<P>
No matter the lake's international image as a natural wonder of the world, the 
notion of taming and sweetening it has tempted some Utahans since the first 
settlers arrived. For the inland sea that displays such grandeur on a post card 
has always been hard to live with at close quarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lake Not Picture-Perfect 
</P>
<P>
It can smell like a sewer. It can become so choked with translucent brine 
shrimp that it looks like a swarming fish tank. Worse, unpredictable 
fluctuations of the water level over time have flooded out, or left high and 
dry, every structure built on its shores. 
</P>
<P>
And that shoreline is nothing to write home about, either, being mostly sticky, 
salt-soaked mud flats. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the water has been at a record-high level. And so the golden, 
Oriental turrets of Saltair, its sole resort, now rest atop a wave-blasted 
concrete shell, shielded from further destruction only by a barrier of 
bulldozed rock. Previous Saltairs, beginning with a legendary 19th-Century 
bathhouse and dance pavilion, have met similar fates, as have boat docks, 
built-up sand beaches and various mineral-extraction projects. These days, many 
locals repeat weary jokes about the Not-So-Great Salt Lake and the Great Dead 
Salt Lake when visiting relatives suggest driving out to go for a float. 
</P>
<P>
Dikes along the inhabited eastern side have always seemed the best way to 
control the water level. A stable water line would give a permanent shore and 
allow for a reasonable return on a developer's investment. 
</P>
<P>
But every dike scheme has proved too expensive. Meanwhile, for six years, 
Johnson has been talking up his plan, which he contends will cut that cost by 
as much as two-thirds. And now, powerful financial and political allies have 
quietly picked up his cause. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, the Utah Legislature, the state's second-largest bank and many of 
its biggest industries plan to see that Johnson's proposal gets a good test. 
And Republican Gov. Norman H. Bangerter has just named a panel to oversee 
formal study of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Much rests, however, on the approval of the Army Corps of Engineers, which is 
charged with protecting the nation's wetlands. Accommodation also must be 
reached with what Johnson calls those "selfish," even "un-American" 
environmentalists, hunters and others who would preserve those wetlands no 
matter the potential recreational interests of hundreds of thousands of 
sightseers and waterfront homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Great Salt Lake is an important oasis for migratory birds 
traveling the Pacific and Central flyways. Waterfowl hunters and other 
conservationists fear that Johnson's dikes could eliminate as much as 400,000 
acres of bird-nurturing wetland, and they're beginning to take him seriously as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Wagner, regional director of Ducks Unlimited, the nationwide waterfowl 
hunters' organization, has lately made the rounds of government regulatory 
agencies, trying to enlist incredulous bureaucrats in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to these various offices," said Wagner, shaking his head, "they say, 
'They'll never build it.' I say, 'Read their papers.' " 
</P>
<P>
Affluent private duck clubs already are making uneasy peace with the Sierra 
Club and other environmental groups, as well as government conservationists, 
and they even talk of ties to Utah's conservative tax revolters -- all against 
powerboat owners, developers and politicians bent on pulling Utah out of its 
current economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Johnson faces his formidable opponents and their regulations with 
the stubborn faith of a 19th-Century entrepreneur. If, in some future 
environmental impact report, "they find some bug that they aren't going to have 
anymore," Johnson intoned, "they'll stop it." But he said this with a 
long-suffering, optimistic smile. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's plan is cheap enough to be taken seriously because, unlike 
traditional dikes, it would use fill material held in place by precast concrete 
walls. Johnson's other passion is precast concrete. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only thing to build, in my mind," he said one afternoon, sitting in 
his round concrete living room in his round concrete house. 
</P>
<P>
The house is back among trees, on a steep street overlooking the lakeside town 
of Bountiful. Johnson is a tall man with wavy, silver hair. He almost always 
wears a suit and big, black Wellington boots. "My gosh!" and "Good heavens!" 
are the roughest terms he'll use in public. "Oh-ho!" he says cheerfully 
whenever he spots a chink in an environmentalist argument. 
</P>
<P>
He draped one arm expansively across the back of an overstuffed couch and, in a 
soft voice, told how he put up his house 20 years ago. It was hung together in 
six hours by a crane operator and a few relatives. Each precast concrete 
section came finished, with exterior decorative rock, insulation, window 
casings and inside wall surfaces ready for paint. 
</P>
<P>
"The roof is strong enough to support a truck," said Johnson. "Actually a dump 
truck. You could drive around on the roof. It's almost, I think, 
indestructible, in that it can't burn or be destroyed by earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
And it was cheap. If the same mold can be used over and over, as in Johnson's 
round house, precast concrete costs much less than conventional construction 
methods. Johnson paid $4,000 for the wall, ceiling and floor modules for his 
home, about the price of the brick alone for a brick house. Only such features 
as the sparkly ceilings and a chartreuse shag carpet were extra. 
</P>
<P>
The houses Johnson would like to build now would have additional attractions. 
For one thing, they could be adjusted to changing family size. Lightweight, 
movable inside walls would be key to that. 
</P>
<P>
"Movable, and not only that, wifeable," Johnson said pleasantly. "Your wife 
could move the partition. You could come home one day and your wife has not 
only moved the furniture, but the entire house." 
</P>
<P>
Or, he said, expanding the vision, when you have your daughter's wedding, you 
take out the interior walls to make room for the reception, then replace them 
-- minus one bedroom now that she's gone. 
</P>
<P>
What Johnson has actually built over the years are 30 precast concrete 
commercial buildings -- bank branches, credit-union offices and the like. And 
he has developed his technique. Now he can pour and hang panels that are four 
stories high and 20 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, two parallel rows of his big panels, sunk into the soft lake bed and 
filled in between with sand, constitute the core idea of Johnson's inexpensive 
dike. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson smiled and opened a thick ring binder to illustrate the next stages of 
his dream. 
</P>
<P>
Dikes will link two long islands, cutting off a third of the lake. The eastern 
side of the lake will begin to rise, since all the fresh water enters there. 
Conduits will run through the dikes, from the high to low side. In as little as 
a year, in the estimate of some Johnson partisans, gravity will flush the old 
lake water through the conduits into the western, salty side. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes the water-based life style. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson flipped to color copies of magazine pages showing houses with boats 
docked out back. Some are of a development in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Some are 
from Discovery Bay, near Sacramento. Some are from locales whose names have 
slipped Johnson's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we now have," he said with disgust as he flipped to a photo of a 
brown mud flat. 
</P>
<P>
Then he turned to a new imaginary scene, retouched by felt-tip pen, of dockside 
homes with the mountains of Bountiful in the background. 
</P>
<P>
"Bountiful-by-the-Sea," he announced with a dead-straight face. 
</P>
<P>
In Johnson's scheme, tax revenues from the increased value of shorefront 
properties pay for the dikes. Some engineers who have looked at his plans think 
it also might offer an economical solution to Utah's coming shortage of potable 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Far less enthusiastic is George Wilson of the Utah Division of Wildlife 
Management, who came to the defense of the unlovely mud flats one Sunday 
morning as he walked along the dike at Willard Bay, at the northeast corner of 
the Great Salt Lake. Willard Bay is a freshwater reservoir and recreational 
area built next to the lake years ago. It uses about as much dike as Johnson 
proposes for his plan, though that dike encircles far less water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birds' Feeding Ground 
</P>
<P>
On the reservoir side, fishermen in one small boat stayed close to the rock 
barrier, angling for walleyed pike. On the lake side, birds worked the mud 
flats, rooting and scratching for small crustaceans and insect larvae. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't understand what wetlands are," Wilson said with a sigh. "It's not 
just cattails, but secluded mud and water too. And it's the open lake, not just 
the refuges." 
</P>
<P>
Before the recent years of flooding, ducks, geese, various wading birds, 
endangered bald eagles and peregrine falcons, muskrats, weasels, beaver, 
raccoon and skunks all depended on the wetlands of the lake's eastern shore, 
most of which remain under water. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure what the high water has done, but some figures show dramatic 
shifts in migratory patterns. Peak population counts of visiting tundra swans 
-- formerly known as whistling swans -- dropped from 65,000 in 1982 to 400 in 
1987. A million pintail ducks commonly stopped off at the lake each summer in 
the 1960s and early '70s, on their way to Southern California. Now, no more 
than 10,000 drop in to feed. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, oddly enough, is not over saline or fresh water, but the height of 
the lake. Johnson's new water line would have to be high enough to border on 
private, not state, land. Otherwise, he cannot get permission to build the 
waterfront life style that would pay for the dikes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permanent Submersion 
</P>
<P>
But this would leave permanently submerged most of the old wetlands, developed 
and maintained by various conservation groups since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and his supporters say a freshwater lake would create new and better 
wetlands, but offer no specifics. Environmentalists ask where this miracle 
would occur, since a high lake would bring the water up against expensive 
agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists also question just how fresh Johnson's sweetened lake would 
be. Willard Bay is the state's most popular water-based park and is packed with 
water-skiers in summer. But many of the game fish stocked there have died out. 
And, after 20 years, the water is murky year-round. 
</P>
<P>
A worse example is freshwater Utah Lake. The summer algae blooms there have 
given rise to "Ski the Scum" T-shirts. Environmentalists contend that Johnson's 
freshwater lake, formed over the residue of a century's worth of raw sewage and 
dumped heavy metals, would be no better. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think of it as Lake Wobegon," said George Wilson, "where they think 
everyone will be happy and prosperous -- but it won't be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picking a Study Panel 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Lake Wasatch (taken from the name of the bordering mountains) is what 
Johnson calls his vision. Undeterred by such carping is the Lake Wasatch 
Coalition, Johnson's loosely knit group of supporters, who include bankers, 
land developers, public-finance attorneys, engineers and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the coalition got together in the paneled boardroom of Zions First 
National Bank. Johnson, in a dark suit, brought up his worries about the 
unexpected resistance he had encountered from the Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a very severe problem," he said, frowning. The head of the 
corps' Salt Lake City regulatory office had told him that, so far, he saw "no 
way" under federal law that the old wetlands could be developed for housing. 
</P>
<P>
David Hemingway, the exuberant vice president for investment at Zions bank and 
president of the Lake Wasatch Coalition, counseled patience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banker's Optimism 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that at this point we should be discouraged," Hemingway said 
brightly. "Enough people believed that it was worth proceeding, and 
governmental regulations are not the Ten Commandments." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this meeting was to decide whom the group would recommend to Gov. 
Bangerter for the new Great Salt Lake Authority that is to take over further 
study of the project. The men expected their recommendations to be well 
received, since the governor is an unabashed developer himself. Still, they 
wanted to be sure that Bangerter had plenty of "forward-looking" types, as 
Hemingway put it, to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a glaring omission," Brent R. Armstrong, a tax and corporate 
attorney, said as potential appointees were brought up for discussion. "We 
don't have one birds-and-bunnies guy on this whole list." 
</P>
<P>
Others called for adding a woman or two. Adjustments were made to the list of 
names. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pro-Dike Commission 
</P>
<P>
A month later, as they had hoped, Bangerter picked a panel with a clear 
pro-dike majority, including Hemingway and another coalition member. And 
results of a recent poll published in the Salt Lake Tribune showed voters in 
the four lakeside counties to be roughly split on the issue, with 9% of them 
yet to make up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, watching from the sidelines has been Long John Silver, a Great Salt 
Lake visionary in his own right. 
</P>
<P>
Now 79 and hard of hearing, he still goes out several days a week to keep an 
eye on his investment, the boarded-up Saltair resort. Silver adopted his 
nickname when he was a dealer in TV sets and appliances, and kept the persona 
when he went on to develop Treasure Island resort, Silver Sands Beach and 
finally, Saltair III. In each case, the rising lake ran him out of business. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon, Silver, wearing a bolo tie clasped with a gold doubloon, 
spoke of the days when sea monsters were said to live in the lake, when a great 
whirlpool allegedly sucked water into an underground system that emptied into 
the Pacific Ocean, when he and his sons searched the islands for buried 
treasure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Son's View 
</P>
<P>
Silver thinks Johnson's dikes would be popular. He cited the fascination people 
have always shown for the irascible body of water, even in the time of his 
great-grandfather, Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
Young, the pioneer Mormon leader, enjoyed taking visitors on lake tours in his 
paddle-wheeled boat, the Timely Gull, which was powered by two horses on 
treadmills. He apparently liked the lake just as it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he really had a dream for the lake," said Silver. "He just loved 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Young never tried to build a condominium on its undependable shore.

<P>
In the years after the methodical murders of his wife, mother and three 
children in New Jersey, John Emil List painstakingly created a new identity for 
himself in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
He dyed his hair and changed his name to establish new credit accounts and a 
phony Social Security number. He took a new wife, to whom he lied about his age 
and personal history. 
</P>
<P>
List finally was tripped up after nearly two decades in hiding because his new 
persona was made in his old image -- that of a wimpy, bespectacled accountant 
whose life centered around the Lutheran Church. 
</P>
<P>
When Fox Broadcasting Co. aired his case last month on its "America's Most 
Wanted" television show, more than 200 tipsters called to say they thought they 
recognized the former "mama's boy" from Bay City, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tips and Prints 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said two of the tips -- one from Richmond, Va., another from Denver 
-- led them to a mild-mannered accountant in Midlothian, Va. He was a devout 
Lutheran layman and his fingerprints matched those of the fugitive John E. 
List. 
</P>
<P>
The balding bookkeeper, arrested by FBI agents on June 1, claims to be Robert 
P. Clark, a former resident of Denver who moved to the Richmond area 18 months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI says that Clark is the alias List developed when he fled to Colorado 
after the Nov. 9, 1971, slayings in Westfield, N.J., an affluent suburb 15 
miles west of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
In Denver, Clark's acquaintances say they find it hard to believe he is List. 
They remember him as a quiet, kind, intensely private man who worked first as a 
cook, later as a bookkeeper, for small, obscure companies. They say he spent 
much of his leisure time in church-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a man who would never, ever stand out in a crowd," said Carole Burton, 
manager of the east Denver apartment complex where Clark lived from September, 
1978, until November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Quiet Renter 
</P>
<P>
Flipping through his tenant file, she said: "I've never seen anything like this 
in all the years I've been here. The man did absolutely nothing to call 
attention to himself. There are no complaints in his file, no notices, no 
record of repairs, no nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Denver FBI agents say they received no information about the fugitive in their 
midst for 16 years after the grisly "ballroom murders" in New Jersey were 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Even now a chill runs through James Moran, Westfield's retired police chief, 
when he recalls the scene in the sparsely furnished, 18-room mansion List had 
bought for $50,000 in 1966, using money from an inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so methodical, so cold-blooded," Moran said. "We found his mother up in 
her third-floor apartment. She and his wife were still in their bedclothes. He 
even had turned the thermostat down to 50 degrees to preserve the bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Moran said the first two killings occurred sometime in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Murders Reconstructed 
</P>
<P>
"Then he apparently did some errands while waiting all day long for the 
children to come home. And when they did, he shot them, one by one. The bodies 
of the wife and children were on sleeping bags in the ballroom, off the 
kitchen. They had been laid out in a neat row, head to toe," Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of List's 85-year-old mother, Alma, his wife, Helen, 45, and their 
children, Patricia, 16, John Jr., 15, and Frederick, 13, were not discovered 
until the evening of Dec. 7, 1971. They had been dead nearly a month, and by 
that time John Emil List was long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that List, then a 45-year-old accountant with an annual 
salary of $12,000, had two mortgages on the house, totaling $40,000. Moran said 
List had told people that his wife was an alcoholic spendthrift who nagged him 
constantly. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation also revealed that List for years had been siphoning money 
from his mother's $200,000 savings account. "He took out the last $2,000 on the 
day of the killings," said Moran, who found the withdrawal slip while searching 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confessed to Pastor 
</P>
<P>
He also found and read a rambling, five-page confession List had written to his 
pastor in Westfield. 
</P>
<P>
"He wrote of being under a lot of pressure, but I can't reveal anything else," 
Moran said. "The letter will be used as evidence if he goes to trial." The man 
who calls himself Robert P. Clark is charged with five counts of first-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
List had sent word to school that he was taking his children to visit 
relatives, Moran said. List's car, a green 1963 Chevy Impala, was found at John 
F. Kennedy Airport three days after the bodies were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I rode in that old car lots of times, going to baseball practice with John 
Jr.," Robert Compton, now a Westfield police officer, recalled. "John and I 
were classmates and were on the same baseball team. . . . His dad used to go to 
the ball games. When they found him, John Jr. had been shot nine times." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are not certain just when List arrived in the Denver area, but one 
Denver man remembered meeting Robert P. Clark in Golden in early 1973, just 
over a year after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, said Robert Wetmore, a 72-year-old retired ranch hand, Clark was 
working at the Holiday Inn in Golden, just west of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fry Cook Days 
</P>
<P>
"Bob was in the kitchen, working as a fry cook," Wetmore recalled. "He was 
working the night shift and I cleaned the kitchen. We became friends, you might 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Wetmore said Clark then lived in a ramshackle trailer park on the outskirts of 
Golden. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob didn't have a car at the time so I helped him move out of the trailer park 
into an apartment a few blocks east of the motel," he said. "He didn't have 
much stuff then, but later, when I helped him move again, he had begun to 
acquire more possessions." 
</P>
<P>
Clark held several cooking jobs in the early '70s and moved frequently, Wetmore 
said. He usually chose large apartment complexes where it was easy to remain 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob didn't talk much about his past," Wetmore said. "Once, when I asked him, 
he said he was from Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
That was not a lie. John Emil List was born 63 years ago in Bay City, Mich., 
the son of a wealthy German immigrant grocer who had married, for the second 
time, late in life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Mama's Boy' 
</P>
<P>
Laura Werner, who rented an apartment from the family, remembers List as a 
sweet little mama's boy. 
</P>
<P>
"He and his mother were very close," Werner said. "She had married in her 30s, 
and John was her only child. He was the apple of her eye." 
</P>
<P>
She said List, who spoke fluent German, attended a Lutheran elementary school 
and later went to public high school. He joined the Army in World War II and 
later attended the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
List worked in Detroit and Kalamazoo, Mich., before rejoining the Army during 
the Korean War. He was stationed at Ft. Eustace, Va., when he met the woman who 
would become his wife. She had been previously married and had a daughter. 
</P>
<P>
List later worked in Rochester, N.Y., and Jersey City, N.J., before taking his 
family to Westfield in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Little of this past did List, as Clark, ever reveal. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when Wetmore asked his friend if he had a family anywhere, it touched a 
nerve. "He snapped at me, 'No family!' " Wetmore recalled. "That was the only 
time I ever saw Bob show any anger." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claimed to Be Widowed 
</P>
<P>
Gary Morrison, a former chef at the motel, remembered Clark saying he had once 
been married but his wife had died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Clark joined St. Paul's Lutheran Church in downtown Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The pastor, the Rev. Bob West, said Clark became a pillar of the church during 
the 11 years he attended, and even served on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I once asked Bob how he happened to choose us, and he said it was because we 
were on the bus line," West recalled. 
</P>
<P>
At a church singles party in 1977, Clark met Delores Miller, a 40-year-old 
divorcee. By then, he owned a 1974 Volkswagen and had gotten an accounting job 
working for a company that made cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Clark moved in with Miller in November, 1985. They were married a month later. 
</P>
<P>
"Delores never told me about Bob," said Wanda Flanery, Miller's neighbor in 
Denver. "I didn't meet him until he moved in." 
</P>
<P>
She said the newlyweds were a lot alike. Both were quiet, reserved people 
devoted to the Lutheran faith. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laid Off From Job 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, Clark was laid off. His wife's salary as a clerk at the 
Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center was not enough to support them and they began 
to slip behind in their monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
For 18 months, Clark kept house and always had dinner waiting for his wife, 
Flanery recalled. In late 1987, Clark answered an ad from a Virginia employment 
agency that set up interviews with a Richmond accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Clark left Denver in February, 1988, to take the new job, just as the company 
was getting busy with tax season. Four months later, his wife joined him in 
Midlothian, a suburb southwest of Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
"Delores had mixed emotions about leaving," recalled Flanery, who said they had 
been neighbors and friends for five years. "She said she really didn't want to 
leave Denver, but Bob had been out of work since shortly after they were 
married and he had finally found this job in Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
Flanery received two letters from Delores Clark after she moved away. Her 
friend mentioned recurring financial problems and said she might have made a 
mistake leaving Denver. 
</P>
<P>
To make ends meet, Clark had begun moonlighting for H &amp; R Block, and his 
wife started working one day a week in a hair salon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call From Wife 
</P>
<P>
"Delores called me on this past Mother's Day," Flanery said. "That was the last 
I heard from her before Bob was arrested." 
</P>
<P>
Clark was picked up 11 days after the "Most Wanted" broadcast dramatized the 
ballroom murders. The program, one that Clark watched regularly and often 
recommended to neighbors, featured a plaster bust portraying List as he might 
look now. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'That's Bob,' " Flanery recalled. "I told my son-in-law to call the 
FBI and give them Bob and Delores' address in Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
After her husband's arrest, Delores Clark told the FBI she couldn't believe he 
was a murderer. At a recent news conference, she described him as a good 
husband with a deep and abiding faith in God. 
</P>
<P>
Clark had told her that he had been married previously but that his wife had 
died of cancer before he came to Denver, she said. He had told her he had no 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Wanda Flanery said Clark's arrest should not have come as a complete shock to 
her friend, however. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Face in a Tabloid 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago I bought a supermarket tabloid that contained an article 
on the List murder case," she said. "The article had a sketch of how List might 
look now, and it was a dead ringer for Bob. 
</P>
<P>
"I took the paper next door and showed it to Delores. She turned pale and kept 
looking at it, saying, 'Oh, my! Oh, my!' " 
</P>
<P>
Flanery recalls asking Delores Clark then if she thought her husband might be 
John List. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, Delores shook her head and said, 'That's not my husband.' I then 
dared her to show it to Bob and ask him, but I don't think she ever did. She's 
not a strong person and I don't think she felt she could have faced the truth, 
so she just let it lie." 
</P>
<P>
Delores Clark acknowledged at her news conference that she had dismissed the 
magazine article from her mind and had never shown it to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Does Flanery have any regrets about turning in Clark? 
</P>
<P>
"I did what I thought was best," she said. "For all I knew, Delores was in 
danger. If he did it once, he could have done it again, especially since they 
were having financial problems."

MEDICINE BEHIND BARS: QUALITY CARE IS ELUSIVE, DESPITE LAWSUITS; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTILE PUBLIC, SHORTAGE OF GOOD DOCTORS AND NURSES WORSEN PRISON PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Medicine behind bars begins with the fundamental paradox of caring for misfits 
banished from a society that couldn't care less about their well-being. 
</P>
<P>
This and a heap of more specific problems add up to a constant struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and nurses, in great demand in the outside world, must be recruited to 
work for civil service wages in steel-barred surroundings. The National Health 
Service Corps, a federal program that allowed doctors to pay off education 
loans by working in prisons, was dismantled by the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Convicts bring a hodgepodge of untreated ailments into prison. Overcrowded 
cellblocks sizzle with fear of AIDS, tuberculosis and other contagious 
diseases, and prisons are being forced to open costly geriatric wards for 
graying inmates with heart or lung disease and other chronic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
One source of relief from many other societal ills, the state legislator, has 
been more likely to dole out condemnation than compassion for criminals -- who 
cannot vote. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates' advocates say that quality medical care in prisons remains elusive 
despite court orders, national guidelines and more money grudgingly given. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a general contradiction in providing health services and locking 
people up in steel cages. Prisons deform everybody," said Robert Cohen, former 
medical director at New York City's Rikers Island Prison and an expert medical 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
Armond Start, medical director of the Wisconsin prison system, added: "Prisons 
are the most anti-therapeutic places there are." 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans seem indifferent to what happens inside prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"Prisoners are a pariah kind of constituency," said Edward Koren of the 
American Civil Liberties Union. "We treat them like garbage. You leave it 
outside in the trash can and don't want to see it again. Nobody cares -- unless 
it comes back again." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota inmate Henry Jackson, a 69-year-old sex offender who has diabetes and 
high blood pressure, said: "We're just dogs. We're nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Medical care for inmates is a legal obligation, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that "deliberate indifference to serious 
medical problems of inmates constitutes cruel and unusual punishment." The 
decision made prisoners the only U.S. citizens who are guaranteed medical care 
at government expense. 
</P>
<P>
Having the right to care does not guarantee Mayo Clinic-style treatment, 
however. No federal or state authority has spelled out what constitutes 
adequate medical attention, so it remains a matter of court interpretation. 
Since 1982, only 10% of the nation's 600 prisons have complied with guidelines 
offered by medical professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The following court cases illustrate some of the problems in prisons since the 
guidelines were issued: 
</P>
<P>
* Six inmates in a Pittsburgh prison died within the last two years under 
"appalling, shocking and dangerously inadequate" conditions, according to 
Cohen, who testified in May in a federal lawsuit brought by several inmates. 
Cohen said that one AIDS-afflicted prisoner died of pneumonia, a diabetic died 
from lack of insulin and the other deaths resulted from improper diagnoses and 
treatments of heart attacks and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
* In Minnesota's Stillwater Prison, a third of the 1,200 inmates and at least 
five guards contracted tuberculosis between 1982 and 1986. The first case was 
not diagnosed until six months after the inmate sought treatment, and 
corrections officials waited until two years after inmates filed suit to test 
for the airborne bacterium in the prison. 
</P>
<P>
* A 25-year-old convict died in May, 1987, after suffering an asthma attack at 
Deer Island House of Corrections, a pre-Civil War lockup near Boston. According 
to a pending wrongful-death suit, the man was turned away from the infirmary at 
the 8 p.m. lockup, and the guards who dragged him to his cell ignored agony so 
intense that the inmate urinated as he was hauled up three flights of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
* Hospitalized inmates from Rikers Island were shackled to bed frames and 
watched by guards until 20 months ago. Among them were AIDS patients, pregnant 
women and life-support patients. 
</P>
<P>
"They were too ill to get out of bed, much less get out of the building," said 
Dale Wilker of the Prisoners Rights Project, which sued to have the shackles 
unlocked. 
</P>
<P>
* At New York's Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, several patients 
had to be hospitalized because dentist Donald Collings' drill slipped in their 
mouths while he was drunk, according to a 1984 suit filed by the Prisoners 
Rights Project. Collings resigned and the state paid damages of $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
Medical care remains a frequent topic of lawsuits filed by U.S. inmates, whose 
numbers reached a record 627,402 in January. 
</P>
<P>
Courts have ordered eight states and Puerto Rico to improve the medical care in 
their prison systems, and are demanding corrective actions at individual 
prisons in 30 other states. Lawsuits are pending in five states, according to 
the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Obvious Improvements 
</P>
<P>
But there is unanimous agreement that prison medical care has improved since 
the courts got involved. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brutsche, who retired last year after 19 years as medical director of 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said the quality of care "improved by light 
years. The changes are like night and day." 
</P>
<P>
One indication of progress is the amount of money being dedicated to the 
problem. The states spent $80 million on prison health care in 1975 and $215 
million in 1980, according to a survey conducted by the Associated Press. The 
costs this year will be about $1 billion, or about 8% of the $16 billion it 
costs to house inmates, according to national estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan spends the most, an average of $7.58 a day, for its inmates' medical 
care, according to Corrections Yearbook. Hawaii spends the least, $1.14 a day. 
The national average is $3.57. 
</P>
<P>
The tide began to turn 15 years ago, when federal Judge Frank Johnson found 
"barbarous" and "shocking" conditions in Alabama and for the first time placed 
an entire state system under federal control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge's Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that "unsupervised prisoners without formal training regularly 
pull teeth, screen sick-call patients, dispense as well as administer 
medication, give injections, take X-rays, suture and perform minor surgery." 
</P>
<P>
The conditions, which inmates' attorney Matthew Myers called "symptomatic of a 
national crisis," included these atrocities: 
</P>
<P>
* A quadriplegic's bedsores developed into open wounds and became infested with 
maggots. His bandages weren't changed in the month before his death. 
</P>
<P>
* An inmate who required intravenous feedings received no nourishment for three 
days before he died. 
</P>
<P>
* An inmate who had suffered a stroke was forced to sit on a bench so he 
wouldn't soil his bed. He fell so frequently that his legs became swollen and 
crippled, and he died a day after one leg was amputated. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama improved conditions enough that federal control was lifted last 
December. One problem Alabama shared with other states was that unlicensed 
doctors were hired to practice on inmates. It was the first state to contract 
with a private company that supplied licensed physicians; now, all or part of 
medicine in the prisons of 29 states is handled by such contractors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doc Holiday Syndrome 
</P>
<P>
"The norm 15 years ago was a broken-down doctor with an institutional license, 
someone who couldn't practice on the outside because he was too old, too sick 
or an alcoholic," said Dr. Jay Anno of the National Commission on Correctional 
Health Care. 
</P>
<P>
At about the time the courts began demanding improvements, health-advocacy 
groups were reacting to conditions exposed through rioting at several prisons, 
including the 1971 uprising at Attica, N. Y. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care identified 71 
minimum standards for medical care in prisons. About 60 prisons have met the 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines recommend medical screening of all incoming inmates, daily 
access to sick call, 24-hour nursing care in hospital wards and uniform 
licensing standards and regulation of doctors, nurses and other personnel. 
</P>
<P>
While most state prisons now employ only reputable physicians, problems with 
doctors persist. Many facilities have hired graduates of foreign medical 
schools who understand little English. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communication Difficult 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't necessarily mean they're quacks. Their English is terrible and 
they have a hard time communicating," said William Rold of the Prisoners Rights 
Project in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Prison doctors may also treat ailments for which they have no training. In the 
1970s, a gynecologist did dental exams at Bedford Hills, the Prisoners Rights 
Project said. In another New York prison, a pathologist practiced general 
medicine and a pediatrician served as an internist. 
</P>
<P>
Low salary is one of the biggest barriers to attracting doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii, for example, pays prison doctors $35,000 a year -- and a third of the 
nursing jobs in Hawaii prisons are unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"What doctor in his right mind would want to practice medicine for 
civil-service pay under harsh conditions for a group of patients that doesn't 
like or trust him?" Curtis Prout, director of the internship program at Harvard 
Medical School, asked. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Dr. Ronald Shansky, medical director of the Illinois prison system, put 
it: "No one goes to medical school and says, 'Boy, when I get out, I'm going to 
go to a prison and make my mark.' "

Police in Fresno arrested dozens of demonstrators who blocked the entrance of a 
clinic near downtown Fresno as part of "Operation Rescue," a nationwide 
anti-abortion campaign. The Family Planning Associates Clinic, which performs 
from 75 to 100 abortions daily, was prevented from opening by more than 100 
sit-in demonstrators who ignored a police order to disperse. Arresting officers 
carried the protesters to buses.

Jose Antonio Zorrilla, once head of Mexico's now-defunct Federal Security 
Directorate, was indicted for murder in the 1984 slaying of journalist Manuel 
Buendia. Prosecutors contend that Zorrilla, 47, masterminded the killing of the 
influential Excelsior newspaper columnist, who was shot in the back in a Mexico 
City parking lot on May 30, 1984. In presenting its case, the prosecution said 
Buendia was slain because Zorrilla feared the journalist would expose links to 
some of Mexico's major drug traffickers. Zorrilla, who has denied having any 
role in the murder, did not enter a plea at the hearing. At the same time, an 
arrest warrant was issued for Buendia's alleged assassin, but authorities 
refused to disclose the identity of the suspect.

Israeli soldiers reportedly shot and killed a 15-year-old Palestinian and 
wounded 15 Arabs in clashes that broke out during a Palestinian strike to 
protest Israel's Middle East peace plan. Arab reports said the strike was 
observed in the Gaza Strip, where troops on Friday killed three Palestinians. 
In the Khan Yunis refugee camp, soldiers shot Akram Mohammed Schade Saada in 
the neck, and he later died at the nearby Nasser Hospital, Israel Radio 
reported. The army immediately imposed a curfew on the camp, forcing its 35,000 
residents to stay indoors, Arab reports said.

Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail party failed in its gamble 
to win a majority in snap parliamentary elections, but he vowed to form a new 
government and remain in power. Official results showed the party fell six 
seats short of a majority, winning 77 seats, four fewer than it held before 
Thursday's election. The main center-right opposition party, Fine Gael, was 
second with 55. Left-wing parties made a strong showing, with the Labor Party 
and Workers Party capturing a total of 22 seats.

Thousands of Richmond residents filed suit against Safeway, charging that 18 
deaths and a variety of health problems were caused by a fire that gutted its 
480,000-square-foot distribution center last year. The fire burned for five 
days in July, creating a lingering stench and raining ashes on a surrounding 
low-income residential area. The suit, filed in Alameda County Superior Court, 
lists 5,500 plaintiffs in the first 44 pages. Safeway, which has settled 
thousands of claims out of court since the fire, had no comment. Residents 
affected by the fire allege that the grocery chain offered them only nominal 
payments because they are poor and black.

Until a security system is installed in September, veterans of the Vietnam War 
plan to guard a Sacramento memorial that has been vandalized over the last few 
months. Pairs of volunteers, some of them attired in camouflage fatigues they 
wore in Vietnam, will stand guard in four-hour shifts at night and on the 
weekends. State police and members of the California Conservation Corps will 
keep watch during weekdays. The $2-million memorial to more than 5,800 
Californians killed in the Vietnam War was dedicated in December at the east 
end of Capitol Park. Vandals broke parts of an M-16 rifle sculpted in bronze 
and a miniature M-16 on a wall plaque in late February and again in April. A 
flag was also stolen in April.

Anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested in four states. Ninety anti-abortion 
protesters were carried away by police in St. Petersburg, Fla. The protesters 
were met at the clinic by about 20 counter-demonstrators. Chicago police 
carried away dozens of anti-abortion protesters at a North Side clinic. They 
said 73 people will be charged. About 2,000 abortion rights advocates rallied 
in downtown Chicago, where about 250 anti-abortion demonstrators also showed 
up. In West Hartford, Conn., police arrested 261 protesters at the Summit 
Women's Center as 100 pro-choice advocates demonstrated nearby. In Dallas, 44 
people were arrested at Routh Street Women's Clinic.

A proposal for a cartel system to control the ivory trade as an alternative to 
a global ban was rejected at a conference of African nations. The conference, 
held in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, was attended by nearly 200 delegates 
from 35 African states. The ivory trade proposal was drafted by southern 
African states in support of Zimbabwe, which has more elephants than its land 
can support.

CAMPAIGN-FINANCING LAW PRODUCES ONLY CONFUSION THUS FAR 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a year after California voters approved Proposition 73, one thing is 
certain: no one is sure how the state's new campaign finance law is going to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission, the state's campaign oversight agency, 
is still in the process of interpreting the initiative and issuing regulations 
that tell candidates and campaign contributors how to comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a total of 10 lawsuits have been filed in courts around the 
state challenging key provisions of the initiative and some of the regulations 
already adopted by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting confusion has left candidates, political fund-raisers and 
potential donors uncertain as to how to operate within the law as they prepare 
for the 1990 elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's worrying," said one adviser to a Democratic candidate who asked 
not to be identified. "The state of it is so unsettled it's very painful. Even 
if you want to comply with the spirit of the law it's hard to know." 
</P>
<P>
When the dust finally settles, some critics of Proposition 73 predict, the 
initiative will do far less to reform the political system than voters expected 
when they approved the measure. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, next year's elections will be a period of experimentation in which 
candidates will discover how the law works and the public will see whether it 
really reduces the cost of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury is clearly still out," acknowledged Assembly Republican Leader Ross 
Johnson of La Habra, the primary author of Proposition 73. "It's really not 
been put to the test yet. Part of that is just the general confusion of all 
these court actions and conflicting decisions by the Fair Political Practices 
Commission. It's been sort of left in limbo." 
</P>
<P>
Billed as a "campaign reform" measure, Proposition 73 was sponsored by Johnson, 
Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) and Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier). 
(Montoya pleaded not guilty last week to 10 counts of extortion, racketeering 
and money laundering stemming from the FBI's undercover investigation of 
political corruption in the state Capitol.) 
</P>
<P>
The initiative was designed to limit the size of campaign contributions, ban 
the transfer of campaign funds between candidates and prohibit the use of 
campaign funds collected before Jan. 1. It also contains provisions banning 
mass mailings of more than 200 pieces sent at taxpayers' expense, prohibiting 
candidates from spending money they raised for one race on a campaign for 
another office, and limiting to $1,000 the size of some gifts and honorariums 
elected officials can receive. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the only major provisions that have not been modified by 
regulations or challenged in court are the ban on transfers of campaign funds 
from one candidate to another and the campaign contribution limits of $1,000 
from individuals, $2,500 from small political committees and $5,000 from 
broad-based political committees per fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
John Larson, chairman of the Fair Political Practices Commission, said the 
five-member panel has struggled to find rational ways to implement the 
initiative but sometimes has been frustrated by ambiguous language in the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not well written," he said. "Many of these questions could have been 
worked out (when the initiative was drafted)." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, members of the commission have been disappointed by court actions 
overruling some of the agency's regulations. Larson said he is concerned that 
some legal challenges to the initiative may not be resolved before the 1990 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like every time we think we're on the path to something, there's 
another court decision that throws a monkey wrench in things and we have to 
re-evaluate," Larson said. "It would be unfortunate if it took so long that the 
1990 election had to be carried out under a court order that had not had time 
for appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Fair Political Practices Commission joined Democratic 
leaders and Assemblyman Johnson in asking the California Supreme Court to 
consolidate the various lawsuits and settle once and for all what the measure 
means. But the high court declined to take the case, leaving the suits to wend 
their way through state and federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant court decision so far was a preliminary injunction issued 
by U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton overruling the commission's 
regulations in three areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Makes Ruling 
</P>
<P>
In the case brought by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and labor unions, Karlton 
ruled that candidates who had raised money before Jan. 1 could spend all the 
money in future campaigns as long as they did so in keeping with the 
contribution limits of Proposition 73. This decision was welcomed by 
politicians such as Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate for 
governor who had collected $1.5 million before 1989 and now would be able to 
spend much of it in his upcoming race. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, making it much easier for politicians to switch from one race to 
another, also ruled that a candidate who had raised money for one campaign 
could spend it on his own campaign for a different office. 
</P>
<P>
And Karlton overturned a provision that restricted political endorsements 
contained in mass mailings sent out by labor unions and other membership 
organizations. Under Proposition 73, political endorsements included in a 
group's regular newsletter had been considered as in-kind political 
contributions and therefore subject to the initiative's $2,500 or $5,000 
contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge said that placing such a restriction on the ability of a group to 
communicate with its own members was not constitutional and ruled that unions 
and other groups were entitled to endorse candidates in regular publications 
they send to their members. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Karlton is scheduled to consider other Democratic challenges to the 
law, including a motion recently filed by the Democratic Party seeking to have 
political parties excluded from the restrictions on membership mailings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek to Overturn Ruling 
</P>
<P>
Several other lawsuits have sought to overturn a ruling by the Fair Political 
Practices Commission that the passage of Proposition 73 completely negates 
Proposition 68, a rival campaign finance measure sponsored by Common Cause. 
Proposition 68 was approved in the same election but received fewer votes than 
Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the cases, backers of Proposition 68 have asked an appellate court in 
Los Angeles to rule that several of their measure's provisions should be 
allowed to go into effect because they do not conflict with Proposition 73. In 
particular, they want the court to keep Proposition 68's ban on fund-raising 
during non-election years as well as a total limit on the amount of money 
candidates can receive from all organizations during an election year. For 
Assembly candidates the limit would be $50,000 and for Senate candidates it 
would be $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 73 is not going to make that much difference," said Walter Zelman, 
a Common Cause lobbyist and backer of Proposition 68. "It's not going to reduce 
the influence of special-interest groups and it's not going to do very much to 
reduce campaign spending. Proposition 73 was primarily a fraud, concocted by a 
few legislators and interest groups to undermine the real reform measure that 
was on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
In another lawsuit, Sacramento County has sued the Fair Political Practices 
Commission seeking to overturn Proposition 73's ban on public financing of 
campaigns. Under the county's Charter, Sacramento candidates had been able to 
receive taxpayers' money for their campaigns if they agreed to abide by 
expenditure limits. The only jurisdiction in the state to offer public 
financing, the county contends that its law should not be preempted by the 
statewide ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interpret Ambiguous Section 
</P>
<P>
Among the many regulations adopted by the Fair Political Practices Commission 
was a rule interpreting an ambiguous section of Proposition 73 that talks about 
limiting the amount of gifts and honorariums that legislators can receive. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, however, adopted the least restrictive interpretation possible. 
Leaving a large loophole in the law, the panel ruled that there are no limits 
on gifts to legislators and that the $1,000 limit on honorariums applies only 
to a lawmaker's speeches or articles on an issue relating to the "governmental 
process." Legislators who give speeches on other subjects can accept 
honorariums of unlimited size, the commission decided. 
</P>
<P>
"We're interpreting the law as we see it," said Larson, the commission 
chairman. "I think maybe the law should be different from some of these 
decisions but it's not." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson defended his initiative and criticized the Fair Political Practices 
Commission and courts for weakening it. In particular, he said, Proposition 73 
has been watered down by decisions that broaden the kind of mass mailings 
elected officials can send out and allow politicians to use assets obtained 
before Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I have argued against many of the interpretations they've made," Johnson said. 
"They've made some initial mistakes and now some of those mistakes are being 
compounded and made worse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Significant Element 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the GOP leader said he believes the most significant element of 
the proposition -- the ban on transfers of money between candidates -- will 
survive the court suits and commission rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson conceded that Proposition 73's limits on gifts and honorariums are too 
weak and said he hopes to change that with a new initiative he is planning for 
the 1990 ballot. Among other things, that measure would ban gifts and 
honorariums for elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never argued that Proposition 73 is perfect or solves all the problems 
of the world," he said. "Sometimes in politics you have to compromise a little 
bit to gain support, and I did." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also criticized Democrats who control the Legislature for subsidizing 
the legal challenges to Proposition 73. An aide to the Republican leader said 
the Legislature has paid at least $179,000 in taxpayers' money to law firms 
that filed four of the cases seeking to overturn the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
While the legal disputes go on, donors and politicians already are learning to 
live with the new contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Early for Results 
</P>
<P>
Most observers say it is too early to tell whether Proposition 73 has affected 
a politician's campaign fund-raising. The first period subject to the limits is 
Jan. 1 through June 30. Reports on how much money was raised during those 
months will not be filed until July. However, Johnson said he believes that 
lawmakers are collecting less money than in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're raising less, but if I'm perfectly honest about it, I can't 
say at this stage that is because of the positive effects of 73," he said. "I 
think that's rather a result of the confusion that surrounds 73, so some people 
are not making contributions." 
</P>
<P>
But Zelman, the Common Cause lobbyist, contended that many politicians are now 
racing to collect donations before the first fund-raising period ends. "There 
probably is an unprecedented amount of fund raising going on right now to beat 
the June 30 deadline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman also maintained that the result of the campaign finance law will be to 
give incumbents an even greater advantage over challengers, who generally start 
campaigning closer to election time and will have less access to large sums of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attacks on Proposition 73, Johnson said he believes that the law 
will prove to be an important first step in reducing the high cost of political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had it to do over again, I'd still do it," he said. "Ultimately, 73 is 
going to have a very profound effect on the way in which political campaigns 
are financed in California. And if it doesn't, the issue isn't going to go away 
and neither am I. We're going to keep after this thing until we've got her 
tamed."

<P>
In March, retired aluminum worker James Casteel faced a grim prognosis. An 
ulcer about the diameter of a tennis ball refused to heal on the bottom of his 
foot. Two skin grafts didn't help. Neither did a host of other treatments, 
including therapy with pressurized oxygen. The only solution, it seemed, was 
amputation. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought for sure I was going to lose it," said Casteel, one of the 200,000 
diabetics nationwide who suffer serious limb problems as a result of their 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
But then his doctor referred him to the country's 95-year-old leprosy 
sanitarium in Louisiana, now called the National Hansen's Disease Center and 
run by the U.S. Public Health Service. Here a team of podiatrists, physical 
therapists and physicians began treating Casteel's wound. A week later, the 
persistent ulcer finally began to heal. His still-swollen and deformed foot 
won't win any beauty contests, but he no longer faces amputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I get all fixed up, I'm going to get on my boat and sail around the 
world," said Casteel, 60. 
</P>
<P>
As Hansen's disease becomes increasingly rare in the United States, the federal 
facility dedicated to leprosy care is turning its attention to other diseases 
where disfigurement and loss of limbs are major problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's disease -- also known as leprosy -- afflicts about 15 million people 
worldwide. In underdeveloped countries, the illness is at epidemic proportions, 
afflicting as many as five individuals of every thousand. But in the United 
States, just 6,000 patients have the disease. Improved drug therapy means that 
all but a few hundred are treated as outpatients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Chronic Illnesses 
</P>
<P>
Now, the lessons doctors have learned in treating Hansen's disease are helping 
health professionals treat other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and 
rheumatoid arthritis. The techniques could also have applications for other 
diseases, researchers said, including spina bifida, the chronic nerve damage 
seen in alcoholics, and even a few rare genetic diseases that render victims 
incapable of experiencing pain, and thus leave them vulnerable to frequent 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
At the forefront of this research is a special foot-care program that has 
treated about 300 diabetics. Most, like Casteel, came to Carville as the last 
stop before likely amputation. All but one has successfully avoided surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting to see patients who have had ulcers for years get healed," said 
Charles Patout Jr., a physician and chief of the Rehabilitative Branch at the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
About 15% of all diabetics develop foot ulcers, and one in every five patients 
hospitalized with diabetes is admitted because of a foot problem. About 200,000 
diabetics undergo amputation of legs and feet each year, according to the 
National Center for Health Statistics. The cost: About $1.2 billion annually 
for hospitalization alone, not to mention the additional cost of chronic 
disability, welfare and days away from work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simple Strategy 
</P>
<P>
"Yet probably 50% of the amputations of diabetics could be avoided if we could 
transfer the technology from the leprosy lab to the diabetic bedside," U.S. 
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy to save limbs is surprisingly simple and was developed by surgeon 
Paul Brand, a former missionary who treated leprosy patients in India for 19 
years before going to Carville in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Brand noticed that leprosy patients repeatedly injured themselves because they 
lost the ability to feel pain in their limbs. The injuries produced oozing 
ulcers that refused to heal because the patients, lacking the sense of pain, 
continued to re-injure themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The ulcers often became gangrenous and forced the amputation of limbs. But when 
the injured feet were immobilized in a cast, Brand found that "the ulcers 
healed as quickly as a similar wound in a person without leprosy." 
</P>
<P>
The patients, he said, simply "needed to be forced to behave as though they had 
pain." Once healed, the cast was removed and the patients were given specially 
made shoes. "We called them rocker shoes," said Brand, who is now retired and 
lives in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Shoes 
</P>
<P>
"They had a thick, rigid sole, much like an ordinary Swedish clog, and don't 
allow the foot to bend." Injuries decreased dramatically. So did amputations. 
Within two years of Brand's arrival, the rate of foot amputations -- which had 
been the most common operation performed at the center -- dropped to zero. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Brand read a paper in a scientific journal on diabetic feet. The 
author of the article, a physician from Texas, reported that " 'This is what 
diabetes does to the bones of the foot,' and showed an X-ray," Brand recalled 
recently. "And I looked at the picture and said to myself, 'My goodness -- 
those are leprosy feet.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brand and his colleagues wrote to the physician and proposed a meeting. They 
suggested that many foot ulcers, whether a result of Hansen's disease, diabetes 
or any other condition, could be traced to the same problem: insensitive feet 
caused by nerve damage. Brand's prescription: cast, bed rest when needed and 
then special shoes. But convincing other doctors that the strategy worked for 
diseases besides Hansen's was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Brand carted a load of foot X-rays from Hansen's disease 
patients to a medical meeting that same year and placed them alongside X-rays 
from diabetics that other physicians outside the Hansen's disease center began 
to listen. "The (X-rays) matched so closely," he said, "that they became 
convinced." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, John Davidson, physician and director of the Grady Hospital 
diabetic clinic in Atlanta, began referring a few difficult diabetic foot ulcer 
cases to the Hansen's disease center for treatment. Since then the facility has 
treated 375 diabetic patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Costly Techniques 
</P>
<P>
"Today," said Surgeon General Koop, "the rehabilitation staff here has the 
expertise to educate health professionals in preventing most if not all of 
these unnecessary amputations." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the limb-saving techniques are relatively inexpensive. "What they 
are doing here, you can do in any hospital in America without adding another 
piece of equipment," said psychiatrist John Duffy, director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
The program is also likely to be helped by a Department of Health and Human 
Services demonstration project begun last October to test the 
cost-effectiveness of furnishing therapeutic shoes, such as the ones designed 
at the center, to Medicare patients with foot problems. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year or two, the center will open an outpatient satellite clinic in 
more centrally located Baton Rouge to expand the diabetic foot care program. 
Hansen's disease patients receive free care as part of an act passed by 
Congress years ago. Diabetics, however, pay a nominal fee, about $25 per visit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the foot program, researchers are making inroads into treating 
insensitive hands, often another casualty of Hansen's disease. Although far 
fewer diabetics suffer from hand problems, other illnesses, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, take a big toll on hands. So do work-related injuries, ranging from 
industrial accidents to carpal tunnel syndrome, found among those engaged in 
repetitive hand activities such as word-processing and some assembly-line jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hand Program 
</P>
<P>
At the center, a cast program for healing hand ulcers has been started, similar 
to the foot program. So far about 200 patients have been treated in the hand 
program. Most have peripheral nerve damage from injuries. Others have suffered 
from diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. The center also has developed and 
standardized a set of five simple filaments or plastic fibers used to test hand 
sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Each filament is a single plastic strand inbedded in a small Lucite handle. The 
filaments, which range in size from about the diameter of a human hair to a 
brush bristle, are used to lightly touch fingertips and other areas of the 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
People with normal feeling can detect each of the filaments. Those who are 
losing sensitivity can't. "Our hope is that a set of filaments will one day be 
in every physician's office that takes care of diabetic patients," Duffy said. 
"It would be simple to train a nurse or receptionist to do the screen, which 
takes just a minute or two to do, and it would alert the physician to the fact 
that a diabetic patient was showing signs of loss of nervous sensation." 
</P>
<P>
The most sophisticated technology to emerge from the center is a computerized 
surgical work station that can assess all parts and functions of the hand and 
simulate movement. Designed by the rehabilitative research department in 
conjunction with mechanical engineers at Louisiana State University, the 
surgical station uses a CT scan and portrays the 44 separate muscle tendons, 27 
major bones, 18 joints and more than two dozen degrees of freedom in a human 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experimental Work Stations 
</P>
<P>
Long before a scalpel is raised to move tendons and restore some function to a 
diseased hand, the still-experimental work station allows a surgeon to ask what 
happens to the different elements of the hand when the thumb moves this way, 
the index finger moves that way and a tendon is transferred from one finger to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the center have only evaluated one patient using the computer 
work station, but more are planned. And in the next 18 months, the station will 
be used to help design implants to replaced damaged joints, said William 
Buford, a biomedical engineer who heads the center's Rehabilitative Research 
Department. "It's real 21st Century stuff," Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
Another important avenue of research at the Hansen's center involves the drug 
thalidomide, which is banned for general prescription use in the U.S. because 
it causes birth defects. Children of women who took thalidomide during 
pregnancy were often born missing arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
But thalidomide is one of the best treatments for a complication of Hansen's 
known as ENL, or erythema nodosom leprosum. ENL produces fever, nerve 
inflammation, eye problems and a rash of red bumps, which can cause scarring 
and other damage. Thalidomide prevents permanent damage. "It works like magic 
for ENL," said Robert C. Hastings, the physician who heads the center's 
laboratory research branch. 
</P>
<P>
The Hansen's center is one of just a handful of manufacturers of thalidomide in 
the world. Housed in a refurbished first-floor wing, the laboratory not only 
produces thalidomide but also searches for improved versions of the drug that 
would not have the side effect of causing birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies suggest that thalidomide could also play a role in the treatment 
of cancer. Studies of cancer patients at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in 
Baltimore suggest that the drug can prevent many of the unwanted side effects 
of radiation therapy given to bone marrow transplant recipients. Thalidomide is 
able to stop the graft versus host reaction that kills some patients. The 
caution, of course, is that thalidomide could never be used in fertile women. 
</P>
<P>
For researchers at the Hansen's center, the range of new studies based on this 
ancient disease represents an enduring legacy of the shrinking group of older 
patients who still live at the government facility. Said Duffy: "What a 
wonderful thing that out of a disease that is such a scourge, there is this 
evolution of something to give back to society."

REP. UDALL, BATTLING PARKINSON'S DISEASE, FENDS OFF CALLS FOR RETIREMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the House Interior Committee hearing room hangs a portrait of Chairman 
Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.), standing tall with his coat slung over his shoulder. 
The longtime lawmaker, former presidential candidate and well-known humorist 
appears eager for a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
But the man occupying the chairman's seat across the room no longer mirrors his 
portrait. He sits stooped in his chair, his hands quivering and his voice 
barely audible. 
</P>
<P>
Although physically ravaged by Parkinson's disease, Udall, 67, fends off calls 
for his retirement and still gets his message through clearly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Replacement Not in Sight 
</P>
<P>
"My replacement hasn't been born yet," Udall recently told Rep. Ben Nighthorse 
Campbell (D-Colo.), who had the temerity to ask his fellow Democrat whether he 
had been grooming anyone to take over the House seat he's held since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as tough as in the portrait," said Rep. John J. Rhodes III (R-Ariz.), 
whose district neighbors Udall's. 
</P>
<P>
"His mind is still very sharp," said Rep. Don Young of Alaska, the committee's 
ranking Republican. "We've been fighting for 14 or 15 years. I've beat him two 
or three times, but it's very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Udall, who once played a year of pro basketball despite having a glass eye and 
unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination in 1976, has taken 
the disease as a challenge and, his staff says, is fighting it with a sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
There has never been any doubt about that sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Makes Joke About Disease 
</P>
<P>
One of the jokes aides like to repeat was used by Udall back when news was 
circulating about Paula Parkinson, a shapely lobbyist whose kiss-and-tell habit 
had many members of Congress nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two kinds of Parkinson's disease," Udall said. "Both of them give 
you the shakes." 
</P>
<P>
Although Udall, a liberal, says he doesn't use an iron hand to rule the 
committee, which oversees government lands, it's easy to see that legislation 
he opposes doesn't stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans stalked out of a committee session one day in May when their 
amendments to the Udall-sponsored American Heritage Trust Act were defeated by 
Democratic proxies held by Udall. 
</P>
<P>
"My style is different," he said in a recent interview. He uses "the merits" to 
argue his position, he said dryly. Pausing, he said, "I jest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defined Power in Washington 
</P>
<P>
Then, with the sagacity for which he is known, Udall defined power in 
Washington as "the ability for me to have you vote 'aye' when you want to vote 
'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It may be because of a favor from the past, because you like me or because I 
gave time to the opposition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Udall was hospitalized in May to have his Parkinson's medication adjusted and 
for treatment of pneumonia. An old friend, Ben Cole, wrote a column for the 
Arizona Republic suggesting that Udall retire. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt him," said Cole, former Washington bureau chief for the Republic, 
retired and living in suburban Virginia. "I'm sorry for that." 
</P>
<P>
But Cole said he sticks by his column. "You can't ask people to stay young 
forever," he said, adding that he fears that people will start taking advantage 
of Udall because of his health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colleagues Support Decision 
</P>
<P>
Committee colleagues from both parties support Udall's decision to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We owe him," Young said. "Even though we are adversaries on many issues (and) 
our philosophies are different . . . I respect him very much." 
</P>
<P>
Another frequent adversary on the committee, Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.), said 
he would "support Mr. Udall for as long as he chooses to come to Congress. I 
have the greatest respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
Former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, mentioned by Cole as someone who knew when 
it was time to pass the burden to younger shoulders, wrote Udall after the 
column was published. 
</P>
<P>
"Your fellow Arizonans are sitting out here, reading that everybody in the Land 
of Oz is urging you to step down and come home," Goldwater said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'To Hell With Advisers' 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to God you do what you want to do, to hell with these advisers that 
want you to come back. I'd love to have you in Arizona, with me, (but) to be 
honest with you, I'd rather have you in Washington doing the things you do for 
our state." 
</P>
<P>
When he was released from the hospital May 26, Udall's doctors told him to rest 
for a week or two. Five days later, he was back in his office. 
</P>
<P>
"He keeps very active, which is very important," said Frank Williams, executive 
director of the American Parkinson's Disease Assn., of which Udall is honorary 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Williams acknowledged that at times Udall looks bad, but said Parkinson's 
patients have intact mental abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"They do not lose their faculties," he said. "They watch their body deteriorate 
day after day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battled Illness for 10 Years 
</P>
<P>
Williams said some people function for 25 to 30 years with the disease. Udall 
has battled it for about 10. He also suffers from arthritis, said an aide, 
which accounts for his stoop. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's is a neurological disorder that affects automatic movements, 
forcing sufferers to concentrate on muscle reactions normal people have without 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Another symptom is loss of voice, said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that handicap, Udall speaks to other Parkinson's patients at functions 
arranged by the association. "He's an inspiration because he hasn't given up," 
said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Many don't want him to. Goldwater gave Udall this advice on detractors: 
</P>
<P>
"Tell them to go to hell."

2,400-YEAR-OLD SAILBOAT FOUND; LINKED TO PHOENICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

KIBBUTZ MAGAN MICHAEL, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sailboat that sank here 2,400 years ago may be the first vessel ever found 
that was built by the Phoenicians, an ancient people famous for their 
sophisticated boats and mastery of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The craft, the size of a modern racing yacht, sank about 75 yards off this 
communal agricultural farm in northern Israel, archeologists said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items aboard the vessel were a master craftsman's toolbox with a 
drill, a carpenter's square, a heart-shaped jewelry box and a cooking pot still 
covered with soot, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Rosloff, the project's field director, said it was too soon to establish 
the vessel's origin with certainty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believes It Is Phoenician 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "If I had to put money on it, I'd say it was Phoenician. 
</P>
<P>
"During these times in this area, Phoenicians had a virtual franchise on 
shipping," Rosloff said. 
</P>
<P>
He said no Phoenician shipwreck has previously been found. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenicians were the most famous seafarers of the ancient world and 
dominated the Mediterranean with their trade. They emerged about 1,000 BC and 
survived until Roman times. 
</P>
<P>
Rosloff said another early boat, a Greek vessel, was discovered off the 
Turkish-Cypriot port of Kyrenia. Although it was built 150 years later than the 
sailboat found here, it was not as sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skillful Shipwright 
</P>
<P>
The shipwright who built the vessel used iron instead of copper nails common in 
Greek vessels and employed an elaborate technique called scarfing in which 
wooden pieces are fitted together. 
</P>
<P>
"This craft has so many quirks that are different (from the Greek vessel) that 
it indicates a different cultural milieu," said Rosloff as he stood on the 
beach next to an actual-size outline of the hull built with sandbags. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel is 10 yards long, three yards wide and about two yards high from 
keel to deck. Most of the hull has been preserved, but the masts, sails and 
cabin have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Maiden Voyage? 
</P>
<P>
The boat was built around 450 BC and was in its first season, possibly on its 
maiden voyage, when it sank, said Elisha Linder, who heads the project run by 
Haifa University's Center for Maritime Studies. He said the hull showed little 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
He speculated that the sailors got too close to shore because they were hiding 
from pirates or seeking shelter from a storm. A large chunk is missing from the 
hull, indicating that the boat sank after hitting a rock or reef. 
</P>
<P>
For 2,400 years, the vessel was covered by sand and hidden from view. But in 
1985, currents briefly washed away some of the sand, and kibbutz member Avi 
Eshel caught a glimpse of pottery scraps and ballast stones while diving with 
his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Linder had just completed his fifth fruitless summer hunting for Phoenician 
shipwrecks in Italy when he got word about the find in Magan Michael, where he 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Evidence Needed 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a present," Linder said. But he cautioned that more evidence, such 
as a seal or coins, is needed to conclusively link the vessel to the 
Phoenicians. 
</P>
<P>
Since the dig began last year, divers have brought up small pieces of the 
wreck, which is under about six feet of water. On land, the pieces are treated 
with chemicals, and the parts will eventually be reassembled, Rosloff said. 
</P>
<P>
"Through model work and graphics, we will extrapolate the rest of the boat," 
said Rosloff, a lecturer at Haifa University who originally came from Kendall 
Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The delicate excavation work is limited to just a few weeks a year because of a 
heavy surf and strong currents that keep covering the wreck with sand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valuable No Matter What 
</P>
<P>
Even if the vessel turns out not to be Phoenician, the wreck will reveal many 
details about ancient seafarers, said Rosloff. 
</P>
<P>
The hull is the oldest and most complete to be discovered and may reveal clues 
about ancient ship-building techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"The wood that is left is in beautiful condition because the sand covered it so 
quickly," Rosloff said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how ancient boats were built," added Linder. "We will learn a 
lot from this."

HOLY LAND PLAGUED BY FOUL WATER, HALO OF SMOG

HAIFA, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the decades that Israelis were kept busy building and defending their 
nation, they had little time for the environment. As a result, the Holy Land 
today is not blessed with clean air and water. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, is a muddy stream with little 
natural life left, and sewage is seeping into the biblical Sea of Galilee. 
</P>
<P>
In this modern port city, residents are sometimes trapped indoors by 
foul-smelling clouds of sulfur dioxide spewed from refineries and other 
industrial plants. 
</P>
<P>
Although some types of pollution are near catastrophic proportions, most 
Israelis remain apathetic. Reports of mass fish poisonings are met with 
indifference, and Israelis litter their streets and beaches with soda cans, 
empty cigarette packs and plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of most people is that the main purpose is to build the country 
and defend it," said Uri Merinov, head of the Environmental Protection Service. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment is not a political issue in Israel. There is no real public 
movement that demands environmental protection like in the United States or 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Israel does not have such severe problems as acid rain and ocean dumping that 
have awakened environmental consciousness elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until last December that the government formed an Environment 
Ministry to gather under one agency enforcement powers that had been scattered 
in 10 different ministries. 
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Roni Milo is still fighting with the agriculture and 
health ministers over their refusals to surrender authority. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, polluters continue to dump toxic wastes and send dangerous 
fumes into the air. 
</P>
<P>
One of the worst-hit areas is Haifa Bay, site of more than 2,000 industrial 
plants, including a power plant and oil refineries that spew sulfur dioxide, a 
colorless gas blamed for a host of health problems, including respiratory 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our old people are suffering from headaches and breathlessness," said Erika 
Frasch, head nurse at the Iben Ezer Nursing Home, which has 30 patients and is 
about two miles from Haifa's industrial area. "Myself, I feel like I'm 
poisoned. There's smoke all over the city." 
</P>
<P>
On April 30, the sulfur dioxide content in air increased after a refinery 
filter broke down. With a dirty gray cloud hovering over the city, the elderly 
and those suffering from respiratory or heart problems were told to stay 
indoors. Schools canceled outdoor gym classes. 
</P>
<P>
The accident dramatized Haifa's air problems, caused by spotty compliance with 
already lax emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
"In April, we measured violations on 10 days," said Zvi Fuhrer of the Haifa 
Town Assn. for Environmental Protection. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the heavy fuel used in Israel's power plants and refineries 
contains 3.2% sulfur, in contrast to a maximum of 0.5% permitted in Los Angeles 
and 0.3% in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry wants tougher standards, but the Energy Ministry, 
which runs the power plant and the refineries, argues that using low-sulfur oil 
and installing scrubbers would make the plants unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
Although air pollution is a problem mainly in the industrialized coastal strip, 
deteriorating water quality affects nearly all 4.2 million Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Water pollution has been causing dysentery outbreaks in Haifa and the Western 
Galilee since 1985. In hot weather, health authorities frequently urge Israelis 
to boil drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sea of Galilee, which provides about 40% of Israel's drinking water, 
"there has been a gradual but continuous deterioration in the quality of the 
water," State Comptroller Miriam Ben Porat wrote in her 1989 report. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that in Israel, water is not filtered and carries sediments that are 
a fertile breeding ground for germs. 
</P>
<P>
A major pollutant is sewage that overflows or is pumped backed into the water 
system before it has been treated sufficiently, said Avner Adin, head of the 
Department of Environmental Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no specific regulations on what sewage quality should be before it 
goes into a stream or river," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rivers affected is the Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Adin, describing its condition as "not good," said both Israel and Jordan have 
diverted water for irrigation, lowering the river's level and raising the salt 
concentration. Sewage and other contaminants also seep into the river in the 
north, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Merinov blamed Israel's environmental problems mainly on unchecked industrial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
But he said public indifference left over from the ghettos of Europe and North 
Africa -- where people had no control over the environment outside their own 
homes -- was responsible, too. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our major efforts is to change this attitude, but it's going to be 
quite difficult," Merinov said.

EAST GERMANS LOOK WISTFULLY BEYOND THE WALL;

<P>
That quarter of Germany claimed by the Soviets after World War II today boasts 
the best economy the East Bloc has to offer, but East Germans still look 
wistfully to the West. 
</P>
<P>
They could brag about the cleaner shops run by kinder clerks than their 
ideological comrades in the Soviet Union can claim. They could compare the 
foods and clothing available here with the consumer's sorry lot in Romania or 
Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
But television, tourism and trade have drawn the comparative glances of East 
Germans to the West, and impressed upon them how much less they have achieved 
in 40 years of statehood than their West German brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the contrast between capitalism and socialism, West and East, have 
and have not, so stark as in the divided city of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The bright lights and buzzing commerce of the Western sector fade abruptly 
beyond the graffiti-splashed Berlin Wall that has stood as a symbol of 
restriction since its erection in 1961. 
</P>
<P>

Changing Landscape 
</P>
<P>
When the visitor emerges from the walled-off western sector through Checkpoint 
Charlie, the view changes to a gray landscape of cinder-block buildings and 
battered fences hiding the East German capital's ubiquitous construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
As the number of East Germans allowed to visit the West has grown over the 
years -- a record 7 million last year -- so has a creeping inferiority complex 
taken root among the nation's 16 million citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a society of rising expectations," observed a Western diplomat with 
long experience in Eastern Europe. "What was unheard of 20 years ago is 
available now, but still short, and that fuels a sense of frustration." 
</P>
<P>
"We know we have much less in material terms than our brothers in the Federal 
Republic," commented a broadcast executive in her late 30s. "We see it every 
day on television, and in the gifts we get from relatives abroad." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of East Germany's stunted development is the hardship it endured 
in the first years of nationhood. While West Germany pulled itself from the 
smoldering ruins of the Nazi dictatorship with the aid of the Marshall Plan, 
the East German state was at first treated by Stalinist occupiers as a conquest 
that owed what little it had left to the victors. 
</P>
<P>
Industries were rebuilt, but much of the early production was absorbed by 
Moscow to support its postwar recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The modest advances achieved over the last two decades can be attributed in 
part to both official and private generosity of Germans in the West, who were 
able to effect more change in the other Germany after acknowledging its 
statehood in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government pays $430 million a year to maintain its transport corridor 
to West Berlin, a sum one official of the West German Ministry for Inter-German 
Affairs said is considered a "face-saving contribution to improve the lives of 
our fellow Germans." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Millions in Hard Currency 
</P>
<P>
There is also millions in hard currency sent by West German citizens to East 
German relatives that can buy better-quality goods from special stores than are 
available for East German marks. 
</P>
<P>
Western experts estimate that more than 8% of East Germany's gross national 
product is provided by West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
After four decades of division, hopes persevere among older Germans on both 
sides of the border that reunification is still possible. But West Germans 
concede that the prospects are slim as time heals the wound of separation and a 
new generation with no memory of one Germany becomes the majority in both 
states. 
</P>
<P>
The future holds out little hope of improvement for East Germans. The socialist 
leadership of Erich Honecker has failed to embrace either the social or 
economic reforms championed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker maintains that a wholesale revamping of the type Gorbachev espouses 
with his perestroika, or restructuring, is unnecessary in East Germany because 
of his nation's relative success among the socialist states. 
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old Honecker, reported at times to be in ill health but showing no 
signs of an intent to bow out as head of the Socialist Unity Party, dismisses 
suggestions of a unified Germany as an unrealistic refusal to deal with the 
political facts. 
</P>
<P>
He has also dashed hopes that East Germany in the age of Gorbachev and 
glasnost, or openness, might be willing to dismantle the Berlin Wall that 
Western leaders have labeled an anachronism of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to appeals during a recent Vienna human rights conference that the 
Wall be torn down, Honecker declared that it would stand another 50 or 100 
years, as long as the differences dividing East and West demand it. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall was erected in 1961 to stop the flood of East Germans seeking refuge 
in the West.

MILLVILLE, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tall smokestacks of glass factories oversee this weary town, beckoning each 
new generation into the plants where their fathers spent their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Millville High School is preparing to remit its June quota to the factories, 
and to the shops and stores that feed on the factory paychecks. The quota is 
smaller now; more graduating seniors go to college. But many still stay to take 
their places beside their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Scarlato will stay. The 18-year-old was planning to take a bittersweet 
walk in cap and gown this month to the stage set up on the school football 
field to collect his diploma and leave a time that he will never recapture, but 
always remember. His life, as he sees it, now will be a reflection of his 
father's: a life of work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
57% Headed for College 
</P>
<P>
About 2.8 million teen-agers will graduate from high school this month. Of 
those, about 57% will keep going to school in a two- or four-year college. 
Others will go into the military, raise families or do nothing. And about one 
in three will leave the graduation ceremony to go to a job. 
</P>
<P>
For those young men and women, high school graduation is a sudden doorway. One 
day they are in a miniworld of football and friends. The next day, they enter 
an unforgiving world of bosses and bills and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to hit them between the eyes," said Wayne Ingling, one of four 
guidance counselors for the 1,600 students at Millville High School. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Scarlato approaches the doorway eyes open, eager. "I'm going to miss 
school. I'll miss friends, sports, coaches. But I'm glad to get out. No more 
homework. No more rules for things like dress codes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
End of Hard Work 
</P>
<P>
"Graduation does mean something." He broke into a delighted smile. "It means 
the end of a lot of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin is confident bordering on brash. He made a success of high school: his 
B-average grades were tops in his vocational class; he played football and 
track; and his lean, muscular good looks were such that his mother said: "I've 
listened to more than one broken-hearted girlfriend crying on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a smart kid, a pretty good kid," comes the typical assessment from one of 
his teachers. Not perfect: his parents have been called to school more than 
once to hear about minor infractions. 
</P>
<P>
For Kevin, there was never any doubt about what he would do after high school. 
The pattern was set by his father, and his older brother. Since 1955, the 
Scarlatos have run the garage and filling station near their home in tiny 
Cedarville, a small community nine miles from Millville, and have run the 
heating oil delivery business there. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin would go to an auto mechanic's school in Cleveland, Ohio, for nine 
months, and then return to work with his brother and father in the white-gable, 
three-bay station. 
</P>
<P>
"I like auto mechanics," he said. "It's fun. It's easy. It's good money." He 
picks it up quickly, said his auto shop teacher, Robert Chambers. "Things come 
real easily to Kevin," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
His career choice was not an offhand decision. Kevin's mother wanted him to go 
to college. "This kid has a real quick mind for math," she said. "My neighbor's 
kid is an accountant and he's done real well." But Kevin's decision is an 
affirmation of respect for the honest work done by his father, and the elder 
Scarlato quietly notes the honor. He is willing to pay the $10,000 it will cost 
to send Kevin to the top-rated trade school in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'College Wasn't for Me' 
</P>
<P>
"College just wasn't me," Kevin said. "It isn't interesting to me to go to 
school for 12 years, and college for another four. I had in my mind what I 
wanted to do with my life." 
</P>
<P>
And he knows where he wants to do it. "Leave town?" Kevin ponders the question, 
quizzically. "No, I don't plan on leaving." 
</P>
<P>
There are many graduates who decline the leave-home mobility of the age, and 
choose to stay in Millville and the tiny communities like Cedarville that 
surround it. "We see so many kids that just stay and become 'townies,' " said 
Ingling. "It seems like it's hard to leave Millville." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1979, only one in four graduates of Millville High School 
planned to continue to college. Of last year's graduating class, 55% did. 
Warren Elliott, the principal of Millville High School, who graduated from the 
old high school three years before the present school was built in 1964, thinks 
the painful economic downturn of the early 1980s and the disillusioning strike 
helped change attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the family now looks at a kid going to college as a way out, as a way 
to get by the economic troubles," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no shame in Millville in going from high school to work. Wheaton 
Glass, the largest glass factory and biggest employer here, sniffs somewhat 
disdainfully at further schooling. The company has a record of promoting 
factory workers into management, and for most of their work force, "we would 
not be looking for people who have a large amount of community college," said 
David Slack, chief administrator of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who wants a job can get it" right out of high school, said Mike 
Lascarides, who is in charge of promoting economic development in Millville. 
The town has brought new industries here, but "in the last two to three years, 
my problem is not as much providing the industry as providing the work force," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was the lure of family, not fortune, that kept Michael Scarlato here. 
His grandfather had emigrated from Italy, stopped in Philadelphia, and settled 
in Cedarville to grow vegetables. His father, Anthony, kept up the farm, but 
then began delivering kerosene -- carrying it in pails from the truck -- and 
bought the filling station in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scarlato carried on the family business. His son Brian, two years older 
than Kevin, graduated from Millville High School and is now running the repair 
shop in the garage while Scarlato runs the three fuel-oil delivery trucks. 
Kevin's imminent arrival in the family business is a continuation of the family 
legacy that touches a chord of pride in the elder Scarlato. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I am proud of them. I am proud they want to be with me, and work with 
me," said the barrel-chested father, 51. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the privilege of being with my father, of working for 20-some years 
together. Dad has been dead six years now. I tell you what, I miss him. If I 
had a problem, I could talk to him. If I had to make a decision, I could ask 
him. All of a sudden, you're the top dog, and there's nobody to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
Both Mike Scarlato and his wife, Helen, can point from their yard to where they 
grew up. Helen Scarlato's father worked in the glass factory. She had dreams of 
leaving Cedarville. "I always thought of what was out there, maybe in 
California." But the demands of raising a family somehow consumed the years. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever my kids were in, I made sure we backed them up," she said. She worked 
in the grammar school cafeteria when they were young, and then shuttled them 
back and forth to sports practices in Millville when they went to high school. 
"I've been there for them. I'm there in the mornings, there at night." 
</P>
<P>
Both sons have worked in the garage during summers and weekends, but their 
parents have not pushed the obligation. "We told our kids to enjoy high 
school," said Mrs. Scarlato. "These are the fun years." 
</P>
<P>
Have they been? Kevin shrugs, then assents. "Sports was the most fun," he said. 
"You're with a group of guys, and even at practice when you're running, 
running, running, you always had fun." At only 165 pounds, Kevin still was 
tenacious enough to play both offensive guard and defensive end, and was named 
to the all-conference football team this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Football Rivalry 
</P>
<P>
He will, he said, always remember the big game of their championship year. 
Kevin was a junior, and Holy Spirit, the big parochial school from the 
adjoining county, was rolling to another in its string of conference titles. It 
was a team Kevin and his teammates could love to hate. "Spirit's the only team 
that hits you cheap every play." 
</P>
<P>
"They were No. 1 in South Jersey, and we weren't even ranked," Kevin said. 
"They had all the nice, fancy uniforms. They had all the talk. But we knew we 
could beat them." 
</P>
<P>
It snowed and rained in the week before the game, but the Millville team grimly 
practiced as Holy Spirit relaxed. "They weren't expecting us." Saturday morning 
dawned fair and sunny as the teams took the field. "On the first play of the 
game, we had a 4-foot-11 guy who ran downfield and just crushed a 6-footer on 
their team. That set the tone for the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Millville won 25 to 12, and with it the conference championship. "We rubbed it 
in their face. It was so fun," he said. "I'll remember it forever." 
</P>
<P>
There are many for whom the big game at high school remains a highwater mark in 
their life. The challenges of adulthood may be more weighty, but not more 
dramatic nor exciting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Hold on to Friends 
</P>
<P>
Kevin does not intend to let go of those memories, or of the friends he has in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll stay in touch," he said with certainty. "We all said we'd like to come 
back and be at the football games and the track meets, to be around. I won't be 
playing but I'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
He is less certain about other aspects of his life after graduation. First on 
the agenda is trade school, Ohio Auto Diesel Technical Institute in Cleveland, 
which will send him away from home for nine months for the first time in his 
life.

COOPERATION IN NAMING SUPPLIERS WEIGHED BY JUDGES;

DRUG OFFENDERS ASKED TO 'JUST SAY WHO'

<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Reagan urged kids to "just say no" to drugs, and national drug policy 
chief William J. Bennett said it's OK to "just say who" is using. Now judges 
want drug offenders to name their suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
A month after judges in Knox and Anderson counties began asking it, they say 
the question is worthwhile. But defense attorneys and even the Knox County 
sheriff wonder whether it violates protections against self-incrimination, ends 
judges' neutrality, puts defendants at risk and threatens other cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me there's everything to gain and nothing to lose, assuming I'm 
not trampling on their constitutional rights," said Knox County Criminal Court 
Judge Randy Nichols, who figures most of his criminal cases boil down to drug 
use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modeled on Nebraska Program 
</P>
<P>
Criminal court judges in the two counties on May 5 began asking people 
convicted of possession or sale of drugs to name their suppliers in a program 
modeled after one in Columbus, Neb. The judges consider defendants' cooperation 
in deciding plea bargains, and refusal could earn a contempt of court charge, 
punishable by up to 10 days in jail and a $50 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In Columbus, Platte County Juvenile Court Judge Gerald Rouse says more than 40 
other jurisdictions have called for information on the county's year-old policy 
requiring offenders to name suppliers of drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we don't have to do it very often. Once the word got around and the 
first two went to jail, we didn't have much of a problem," Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
The policy has led to only a half-dozen supplier convictions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tennessee, if a supplier's name surfaces, it's up to a prosecutor to take it 
down and decide whether to investigate further, Nichols said. So far only a 
handful of cases have evoked the question. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought Probation 
</P>
<P>
When James Daugherty of Oak Ridge sought probation on a charge of selling 
cocaine, Anderson County Criminal Court Judge James Scott asked it. 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty named "Crazy Joe" as his supplier. "Crazy Joe" Newton, it turned out, 
had been found dead earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Scott gave Daugherty four years in prison, not because of his answer but rather 
his background. Daugherty may have been telling the truth, Scott said, but he 
notes the convenience and wonders whether there will be an onslaught of 
"phantom sellers." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols asked the question May 17 of Jeffrey Clark Evans, who agreed to plead 
guilty to robbery, assault and marijuana charges in exchange for a 17-year 
sentence. Defense attorney Bob Simpson objected and told his client not to 
answer because the judge was no longer neutral. Simpson also said the question 
violated his client's Fifth Amendment right because police could go to the 
supplier, who in turn could implicate Evans on unrelated crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols took no action and scheduled another hearing on the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy May Be Killed 
</P>
<P>
Other defense attorneys, including Bob Ritchie of Knoxville, believe appeals 
courts may kill the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"For 200 years we have administered criminal justice by the investigative 
method," Ritchie said. "To require a person to give evidence of any kind is an 
inquisitorial method of criminal justice. That is abhorrent to the basic 
foundations of freedom on which this country is founded." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said conviction means loss of Fifth Amendment rights, and that the 
judges aren't interested in further charging that person. "If he tells me Joe 
Jones sold it and another week someone else tells us Joe Jones sold it, that'll 
be useful information for the attorney general," he said.

'DRUNK BUSTERS' SPOT IMPAIRED DRIVERS

<TEXT>
<P>
George House has been obsessed with getting drunks off the road since his son 
saw 27 people die when their church bus was hit last year by a truck driven by 
a man now charged with drunk driving and murder. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen-year-old Chris House "was riding a bus behind the one that was hit 
near Carrollton. When he got home, he was still shaken by what he had seen and 
heard. Some of the kids that died were close to his age." 
</P>
<P>
George House, a Transit Authority of River City bus driver for 11 years, "sat 
down and wrote my company, suggesting that any of our drivers who spotted a 
drunk behind the wheel should alert the dispatcher to call police." 
</P>
<P>
The Transit Authority took House's idea to police, who got $1,900 to pay for 
"Drunk Buster on Board" stickers for participating vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 Volunteers 
</P>
<P>
The idea caught on, and there are about 5,000 volunteers like House in the 
Louisville area, all equipped with two-way radios. They are the anonymous 
tipsters who have made "Drunk Busters" a success in Jefferson County and have 
drawn the attention of law enforcers from Florida to Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have 25 firms involved, and more should come on board later. There's 
such a diversity of spotters that the offender won't know whether the 
information leading to his arrest came from a guy behind the wheel of a cement 
mixer or one driving a floral van," police spokesman Bob Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have received more than 100 calls since Drunk Busters began in December 
-- seven months after the Carrollton accident -- and although it would be 
difficult to track each tip in the courts, Yates said drunk-driving arrests are 
up 19.1%. There were 977 arrests in the first quarter for driving under the 
influence, compared to 820 in the 1988 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requests for Information 
</P>
<P>
Police have gotten requests for information from around the country. One 
inquiry came from Paul Feiner, a member of the Westchester County, N.Y., board 
of legislators, which planned to recommend adopting the plan. "I would consider 
the program a success if it gets just one deadly driver off the highway. I 
think it makes sense to get people to work with the police," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David Shedd, president of a beer distributor, was critical of Drunk Busters 
when it was unveiled just before the Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"Our industry was under attack about that time and I thought this was another 
shot being fired at us," Shedd said. "I had volunteered the services of my 
employees to help put out a packet covering drinking and driving." 
</P>
<P>
The packets went to motels, hotels and restaurants and offered hints on how 
bartenders could recognize customers who had too much. Shedd understands the 
intent of Drunk Busters, "but the application bothered me." 
</P>
<P>
House, 39, a former county corrections officer, has turned in three suspected 
drunk drivers recently. "One of them had a can of beer between his legs and a 
case on the seat beside him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Drunkenness 
</P>
<P>
He and others like Roger Coffey, owner of a 23-wrecker towing fleet, have 
learned to spot signs that a motorist may be under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
"They always slow down when they've had too much liquor. If the driver is going 
25 m.p.h. in a 55-m.p.h. zone and he isn't elderly or half blind, watch out," 
Coffey said. "You also have to take a second look at the guy whose vehicle is 
weaving in the roadway, straddling the middle line or accelerating and 
decelerating rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
He said his employees so far have made "25 to 30 calls." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the nature of his business, Coffey had doubts about joining the 
program. "We're the only towing service in it, but we've never towed a drunk 
that we turned in," he said.

A HIGH PROFILE FOR A HERO OF THE MASSES

Odds are, if you were to make an anonymous phone call to anyone anywhere in the 
United States, the person answering would know about the film "Batman." They 
could also tell you that it stars Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton and is 
scheduled to open this month. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Batman's" producer Warner Bros. will not reveal research figures, 
studio officials claim the movie's awareness level is higher than any film in 
the studio's history, even higher, they contend, than pre-opening awareness of 
Columbia Pictures' 1984 release of the first "Ghostbusters" which became the 
highest-grossing comedy of all time at $220 million. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it would be difficult to miss the "Batman" promos. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has seen a movie in the last six months has probably caught a 
glimpse of the 30-second trailers, screening widely since Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heavy cable television penetration here," said Jack Major, features 
editor of the Providence Journal in Rhode Island. "You can't even turn to a 
station without seeing 'Batman' commercials and interviews and film clips." 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to a comic book dealer in Texas," said Maggie Thompson, 
co-editor of the Iola, Wis.-based Comic Buyer's Guide weekly, "and he said, 
'You remember smily faces and hula hoops? "Batman" is a hula hoop.' You don't 
have to be a comic book fan right now to want 'Batman' material. This 
phenomenon has grown to a level unlike anything we've seen before." 
</P>
<P>
Like a dark Santa Claus carrying a bag full of merchandising goodies, "Batman" 
is swooping into shopping centers and landing on the chests of thousands of 
T-shirt buyers across the country. Thompson said when she received a 
special-order 'Batman' catalogue last month, it was as thick as the one that 
lists comic book material and merchandise for the entire industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell 36 different kinds of 'Batman' shirts," said Bill Liebowitz, owner of 
Golden Apple Comics shop on Los Angeles' Melrose Avenue. "We got a call from a 
woman in Florida who ordered a shirt because she felt it would make her son 
more popular at school. Another woman came in and bought a shirt for her son 
who had heard about 'Batman' in the Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
In a six-day period, Liebowitz sold out nine cases -- almost 7,000 individual 
packets -- of "Batman" bubble gum cards. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Liebowitz has hired a security guard and doubled his staff on 
weekends to handle the crowd overflow that jams his store. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the streets the mania is the same. Since May, more than 1,200, 
6-foot-high "Batman" posters have been stolen from display cases in New York 
subway stations and bus shelters in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a first. We've had posters stolen before -- Paramount's U2 'Rattle and 
Hum' was a target," said Doreen Roberts, vice president and general sales 
manager of Gannett Transit billboard company. "But never like this. This is 
unheard of." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Comic Buyer's Guide reports that Batman back issues that were almost impossible 
to sell just a few years ago at any price are selling briskly and prices are 
climbing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' is going for $35 for a first printing," 
Thompson said. "That came out three years ago with a cover price of $2.95. The 
Batman issue in which Robin died is now selling for $30. That came out less 
than a year ago with a cover price of 75 cents." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, "Uncanny X-Man," the perennial comic book leader for nearly a decade, 
averaged $378,135 in paid circulation. In the same year, "Batman" averaged 
$89,217. Although figures are difficult to confirm, every retailer interviewed 
claims that "Batman" has recently overtaken "X-Man" and is now the top-selling 
comic book title. And they attribute much of that success to the upcoming film. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times I'm conservative, because when these science fiction or comic 
movies come out, they don't really do anything for business," said Paul 
Castrovillo, owner of New Mythology Comics and Science Fiction in Boise, Ida. 
"I probably could have sold four or five times as much 'Batman' material as I 
ordered, but I had to order most of it three or four months ago when 
information about the movie was just beginning to leak out." 
</P>
<P>
Boise deejay Jack Armstrong, whose station KF95 is supporting a "Batman" art 
contest that Castrovillo is sponsoring, said listener reaction has been high. 
"Comments have been pouring in from callers ever since we started playing 
Prince's Batman dance song. . . . People call in and want to know things like: 
'Does this movie happen after the death of Boy Wonder? Is it before Boy Wonder? 
Is this a continuation of the comic book?' " 
</P>
<P>
About five months ago, Los Angeles' KTTV Channel 11 began broadcasting 
"Batman," starring Adam West and Burt Ward, on Saturdays and Sundays from 1 
p.m. to 2 p.m. Program director Don Tillman denied the suggestion that "Batman" 
was put on the air to capitalize on renewed interest created by the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"We've owned 'Batman' for a number of years, and the reason we brought it back 
is because we're doing a lot of nostalgic programming on weekends," Tillman 
said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
If there's any doubt that the world is anticipating "Batman," it seems clear 
that Warner Bros. is anticipating the world. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who calls New York's DC Comics -- owned by the studio's parent company, 
Warner Communications Inc. -- with "Batman" questions are immediately connected 
to a prerecorded "Batline." 
</P>
<P>
"We have been inundated with phone calls, so we have set up this phone message 
for your convenience," a voice cheerily states. After referring all inquiries 
to Warner Bros., the voice continues, "Please be patient. Studio personnel are 
doing their best to handle requests. Please do not call us back for 
intervention, even though you might wish to." 
</P>
<P>
A follow-up call to Warner Bros. connects the caller to another pre-recorded 
message asking for a name and number where the caller can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do that because of the sheer volume of phone calls we receive," 
said Charlotte Gee, Warner Bros. vice president of publicity and promotion. 
"Our New York office got a call last week from a member of the public who 
offered to pay $250 for a pair of tickets to see an advance screening." 
</P>
<P>
Theater owners, movie critics and Batman fans cite a variety of reasons for the 
advance interest. Some feel the buzz is due to the presence of Nicholson as the 
Joker; others attribute it to the popularity of the TV show; and most cite the 
wild, white-knuckle trailers that have been showing in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman has experienced a renaissance the last few years," said Jeff Walker, a 
marketing consultant for Warner Bros., who has spent much of the last year 
traveling to trade shows and conventions touting "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
"Batman's impact on popular culture has increased dramatically," he said. "The 
demographics for people who read comics has gotten older. They're a literate 
bunch -- we're not talking about just kids anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Fagan, a 58-year-old promotions director living in Rutland, Vt., was voted 
Chief Batmanian in 1963 by the readership of the now-defunct Batmania fan 
magazine. In his Batman collection, Fagan owns Detective Comic No. 27 -- the 
debut of Batman -- valued at $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
"You can say 'Shazam!' over and over and you'll never become Capt. Marvel," 
Fagan said. "But the thing about Batman is, it's possible that anyone with 
determination can train his body to athletic perfection and become a hero -- 
most of us tried that for a few days, then gave up and kept reading Batman. We 
always knew that at any time Batman could be injured. He was vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
"Midnight Caller," published by 29-year-old Martin Noreau, a graphic artist 
living in St. Hubert, Canada, is the only known Batman fanzine. 
</P>
<P>
"We're basically a bunch of guys who like Batman and want an opportunity to 
express ourselves through writing or drawing him," said Noreau, who edits and 
mails out the 130-page digest from his small apartment. "Midnight Caller" goes 
out quarterly to about 200 reader/contributors, mostly from the United States.

AN OLD STORY BROUGHT UP TO SPEED;

'STAND-UP TRAGEDY'S' FULL-COURT PRESS

</HEADLINE>

<P>
Click/Click/Click/Click. It's the way we take our home entertainment now, and 
it has had its effect on the way we watch theater and movies. Maybe even on the 
way we watch life. 
</P>
<P>
A bad effect, in some people's view. Kids raised on "Sesame Street," teachers 
tell you, can't follow a traditional story. All they want is the ups. 
</P>
<P>
Others argue that it's just the reverse. TV has exposed us all to so many 
traditional stories that a couple of images give us enough to infer the rest. 
</P>
<P>
I tend toward the second view. Theater audiences in the 1980s can still process 
a long narrative, if it's well told. A longer narrative than ever, in fact. 
Look at "Nicholas Nickleby" and "The Mahabharata." 
</P>
<P>
But we are impatient with filler. We don't like being told everything twice. 
Scenes that spend a lot of time explaining themselves begin to seem labored and 
old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, we are perfectly happy with the laconic small-town characters of Horton 
Foote, who tend not to say anything when they don't have anything to say -- and 
sometimes when they do. That strikes us as true to life. A well-observed 
silence in a play like "The Widow Claire" can speak volumes. 
</P>
<P>
And we're happy to listen to August Wilson's characters as they tip their 
chairs back after supper and start telling stories. Language here generates its 
own voltage, as in Shakespeare. We can still listen to him, too. 
</P>
<P>
It's the good gray playwrights who have to worry, the ones who see no problem 
with a line like the dreaded "We've got to have a talk." Click! 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cain's "Stand-up Tragedy" at the Mark Taper Forum (through June 25) is 
aware of all this. It is not an avant-garde play. It has a beginning, a middle 
and an end. It has characters you care about. It has ideas. It is written, not 
shot from a laser-gun. 
</P>
<P>
But it's quick. Rather than being written for the slowest person in the room, 
it presumes that he no longer exists -- that today's viewer not only gets the 
picture right away, but can process two images at once. 
</P>
<P>
It is actually telling a rather old-fashioned story, the one about the 
idealistic young teacher who comes to a slum high school and vows that he's 
going to make a difference (Jack Coleman). 
</P>
<P>
His adversaries include the case-hardened principal who has seen these hotdogs 
come and go (this being a Catholic school, the principal is a priest -- Vaughn 
Armstrong). His fellow teachers include an anal-retentive type who is just 
putting in his time (John C. Cooke) and an outrageous pragmatist whose methods 
include letting his kids cheat (Dan Gerrity.) 
</P>
<P>
The student our hero most wants to reach is a quiet youth with a flair for art, 
an obsession with superheroes and an addiction to his sick, destructive family 
(Michael DeLorenzo.) If only, if only he could be sprung from that grim 
apartment. This kid is college material! 
</P>
<P>
You have seen the movie, yes? You have even seen the TV series. So has 
everybody at Nativity Mission School. They are not interested in being a 
learning experience for our hero. They know how things work in real life. To 
rescue a kid from a "bad home situation" in this neighborhood (the Lower East 
Side) is to run the risk of throwing him into a worse situation. 
</P>
<P>
It also may put his rescuer at risk. You don't get half-way get involved with a 
kid's life and then go home to the suburbs for Christmas vacation, not without 
consequences. Forces have been set into motion -- and at a Catholic school in 
the barrio, the idea of "forces" is not an abstraction. They believe in evil at 
Nativity Mission, and some of them -- or their families -- are hooked on it. 
</P>
<P>
This begins not to sound like "Room 222." Playwright Cain knows this school -- 
he has taught there -- and he remembers how confusing and perverse things can 
get around spring break. 
</P>
<P>
How to convey the welter of life at Nativity Mission, the heart-lifting moments 
and the heart-stopping ones? How to convey the eternal tension and the odd 
cameraderie between the kids and the faculty at an all-male school, not unlike 
the strains of boot camp? How to convey the hilarity of a faculty-student 
basketball game, and the despair of yet another 7 a.m. funeral? How to get in 
the neighborhood in as well? 
</P>
<P>
A movie could flick from image to image, and the viewer could put it all 
together. It's not so easy to do these things in a play. On the stage, images 
have weight -- they're usually attached to actors. "Stand-up Tragedy" doesn't 
see that as a problem. If your actors know how to break-dance, and chant rap 
poetry, and dribble a basketball, and do raunchy jokes, and jump from role to 
role at the pop of the director's fingers (Ron Link is the director) -- then 
the show can be set at whatever tempo it needs. 
</P>
<P>
When first performed at Taper, Too, "Stand-up Tragedy" may have been set too 
high. On the mainstage, it's as fast as a basketball game, without blur. There 
are silences, too, after something has been said that won't be taken back. 
Discussions at Nativity Mission become confrontations without even trying, some 
of the best ones being between Armstrong and Coleman. Watch for the moment 
where the old man fakes the new man out with intimacy -- so to speak -- and 
drives by him for an easy layup. Moral: "Affection is coercion." 
</P>
<P>
But the play's younger actors, in their torn Levi's, convey the fact that this 
isn't a playground game. They are stuck in this neighborhood forever, and 
they've got to find a way to deal with that, whether it's in the syllabus or 
not. Ray Oriel is particularly strong as a kid whom the system dumps on his 
rear just as he's about to graduate. Does he whimper? No, he just gives the 
faculty a look and goes off. To what kind of life? 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Barrile, Marcus Chong, Marvin Columbus and Lance Slaughter are also 
part of the gang, which functions as a sort of double-time Greek chorus, 
specializing in the baddest sort of rap lyrics. Like everyone and everything 
else in "Stand-up Tragedy" they do six things at once, with perfect 
articulation. 
</P>
<P>
Things do start to drag toward the end of the evening, and the climax isn't 
pointless enough -- not as representative of the "ecology of evil" as it could 
have been. (This is one of the play's chief concerns and another reason not to 
see it as just another "Blackboard Jungle." Social engineering as currently 
practiced wouldn't help these kids a bit.) 
</P>
<P>
Even with this energy lag, "Stand-up Tragedy" is the most propulsive and 
exhilarating show in town, and one of the most thought-provoking. Your hand 
won't stray to the remote control.

THE GROWING DEBATE OVER MINIMALISM; 
</P>
<P>
FOUR COMPOSERS' VIEWS ON MINIMAL MUSIC -- WHERE IT'S BEEN, WHERE IT'S GOING AND 
WHAT'S THE BROUHAHA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since minimalism appeared on the music scene 25 years ago, academic 
composers have decried the trashing of their complex music language and the 
acceptance, in its place, of a highly simplified -- some say simplistic -- one. 
Their charge: a sellout to commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
The minimalists say the scholars adhere to an "old-boy network" whose in-bred, 
practically impenetrable scores alienate everyone except each other. 
</P>
<P>
With growing alarm and resentment, the old guard watched while these upstarts 
basked in the spotlight and took the prizes: audiences, publicity, career 
opportunities. They festered. They stewed. For every article on standard-bearer 
George Perle, for instance, there are 500 profiles of the ever-popular Philip 
Glass. For every $10,000 commission given Charles Wuorinen, a $1-million one 
turns up for Steve Reich. 
</P>
<P>
A whole generation has grown up listening to mimimalism's repetitive, 
bare-bones thumping -- in the movies ("The Thin Blue Line"), in dance and opera 
("In the Upper Room" and "Nixon in China"), even in the sanctified museum of 
the concert hall ("Harmonium"). 
</P>
<P>
Critics and commentators have debated the issues but composers tend to be 
closed-mouthed about their peers. Not so Perle and Wuorinen, Pulitzer Prize 
winners, recipients of MacArthur Fellowships and articulate debunkers of 
minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, minimalist John Adams and neo-romantic David del Tredici were 
given opportunities to defend their striking successes. That said, here they 
are in full cry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charles Wuorinen: Thanks to Short-Sighted Critics, the 'Quick Fix' Winds Up as 
Most Popular 
</P>
<P>
Charles Wuorinen treads the same path of rigorously difficult composition as an 
Elliott Carter or Pierre Boulez and talks about his "passion" for music as High 
Art. At 51, he is a fierce polemicist, waging verbal wars against what he sees 
as the rising tide of Philistinism. 
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with the status quo, he does not equivocate in laying blame; his finger 
points first to music journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the fault of the critical press," he says, "that people lose sight of the 
difference between the real nature of a thing and how it is promoted." Citing 
an example, Wuorinen quotes Harold Schonberg, former music critic of the New 
York Times, who remarked 10 years ago: "I am going to protect the public from 
new music." 
</P>
<P>
"That statement outraged me," Wuorinen says, explaining how such a prejudice 
fuels public intolerance "to anything but the familiar. Critics are not 
supposed to be indistinguishable from audiences. They're supposed to know more, 
to stretch the limits of listeners' experience. Instead they try to gauge only 
the immediate appeal of a piece," he charges. 
</P>
<P>
What the New York composer is complaining about is the same thing political 
pundits decried in the last presidential campaign: that after televised debates 
between the candidates, TV anchors waited to see the polls before declaring 
winners or losers, thereby relinquishing their own critical evaluation. Yet it 
would seem that arts critics bow less to popular opinion than television's news 
entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
"Pandering to the least worthy effort just because of its easy appeal serves 
neither the public nor the cause of music," Wuorinen continues. 
</P>
<P>
"Familiarity breeds love, but if audiences never get a chance to become 
familiar with something new, it cannot have an impact. Look at Brahms and 
Tchaikovsky, for instance. It's only because some critics defended their music 
that it is now a concert hall staple." 
</P>
<P>
So have orchestra managements been less than valiant, according to the academic 
proselytizer. He mentions a San Francisco Symphony study, designed to explain 
subscriber dropouts. One woman who let her subscription expire protested being 
duped, he recalls: 
</P>
<P>
"She saw a brochure flagging Isaac Stern and Tchaikovsky and she came expecting 
him to play that composer. As it turned out he performed a new concerto, its 
name buried in fine print, and the orchestra played a Tchaikovsky symphony. Why 
set up that kind of disappointment? Why treat patrons as though they were 
merely customers you're trying to sell toothpaste to? Why not be forthright and 
honorable?" 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, Wuorinen doffs his hat to Ernest Fleischmann and the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic for championing Boulez, the stellar composer/conductor, 
himself a stern tribune of all that's cerebral in music: 
</P>
<P>
"Is he charismatic? No. Is his music anything but complex? No. There is nothing 
half-hearted or apologetic in the way the Philharmonic presents him. And the 
public responds to the endorsement, the year-in, year-out commitment to what 
Boulez offers." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from such a rarely seen attitude, Wuorinen says, "people have stopped 
trying to be civilized. At one time there was a striving for prestige. 
Compositions had stature because they invoked higher values. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, hardly anyone takes such a stand. What we have is the quick fix, the need 
for instant self-gratification. And that accounts for this utterly 
unchallenging, unprovocative kind of music. In fact, it accounts for the 
general ills of our society -- all the way up to our government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"These days it's a question of how many clap the longest and loudest. Nothing 
is being asked of the creator or the recipient." 
</P>
<P>
Lest his comments be seen as sour grapes, the composer points out that he "has 
as much work, and more, as I can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Wuorinen practices the fire and brimstone that he preaches. In order 
to uphold his lofty standards, he founded a chamber orchestra, the Group for 
Contemporary Music. Without absolutely compelling performances, he argues, 
there can be no persuasion of a difficult work's excellence. Too often, he 
believes, unconvincing accounts of new music give it a bad name. And too often 
symphony orchestra musicians show the same skepticism as audiences. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, players do not embrace the typically simplistic examples of 
minimalism. For example, when the Los Angeles Philharmonic played an excerpt of 
Philip Glass' "the CIVIL warS" several years ago, the musicians deliberately 
turned pages noisily to express their contempt of its incessant arpeggio 
repetitions and limited harmonic interest. 
</P>
<P>
Wuorinen, apparently unmollified by this response, fears that "the distinction 
between art and entertainment no longer exists. . . . We've succeeded in 
cheapening art and ruining entertainment. By making popularity the touchstone, 
we rationalize that we're being democratic and realistic." 
</P>
<P>
His favorite anecdote on the subject of music's lowered standards involves a 
composing student who naively told a professor that he wanted to be famous and 
loved and popular. 
</P>
<P>
"How popular?" asked the professor. "As popular as Schoenberg? But Stravinsky 
is more popular than Schoenberg. As popular as Stravinsky?But Beethoven is more 
popular than Stravinsky. As popular as Beethoven?But Tchaikovsky is more 
popular than Beethoven. As popular as Tchaikovsky?But Lawrence Welk is more 
popular than Tchaikovsky." 
</P>
<P>
So much for goals and definitions of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"Our refusal to be serious," Wuorinen says, "can be seen in this surge of 
anti-intellectualism and yahooism. It's been going on for 25 years. If things 
don't change -- and I don't think they will -- serious music will disappear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
John Adams: Dividing Art Between 'Serious' and Unworthy Is Far Too Simplistic 
</P>
<P>
John Adams, a Grammy laureate of different flora altogether, stays happily out 
of academic gardens. Right now, he's fielding phone calls from maverick 
director Peter Sellars, among others, in his hotel room, having just finished 
rehearsing the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra for a concert of 20th-Century music. 
</P>
<P>
He says this is a convenient time to talk, "if you don't mind interruptions. I 
have about 15 minutes before rushing out to a dinner engagement." 
</P>
<P>
Adams has barely said this before another call comes in -- this one from Lisa 
Klinghoffer, daughter of Leon Klinghoffer, the wheelchair-bound American 
murdered aboard the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro by an Arab terrorist in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
What the 42-year-old composer of "Nixon in China" and "Harmonium" is doing is 
another opera based on current affairs -- this one recounting the above 
incident. It too will enlist Sellars as collaborator. Commissioned by six opera 
companies, the work will have its world premiere in Brussels in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Adams has already pondered the debate over minimalism. Creators in a given 
field always seem to know who their detractors are and what they're saying. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I couldn't be happier to answer Charles and his criticisms," says 
Adams. "It's something I've never had the chance to do before. Frankly, (pause) 
I think he's a square. 
</P>
<P>
"To make arbitrary divisions between what is serious and what is outside the 
worthwhile realm is just too simplistic. Has he ever considered that 
Shakespeare and Goethe drew on the vernacular? That they were hardly averse to 
referring to their own contemporary culture? This is what Sellars does so 
brilliantly. It's essential to utilize the environment we are part of, rather 
than cut ourselves off from it." 
</P>
<P>
The argument that art and entertainment run along clear-cut and separate paths 
is one that Adams doesn't buy. While he concedes that Lawrence Welk and 
Liberace are "strictly entertainers," too many others defy such easy 
categorization. 
</P>
<P>
He hastens to add that his own music was intended to have entertainment value 
-- "so did Mozart and Ravel acknowledge it, as well as all the great composers 
did, until these self-appointed guardians of theory came into existence." But 
he finds "the dour, grim attitude behind art for art's sake to be phony." 
</P>
<P>
As for minimalism, per se, he does not object categorically to the term. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there's any more antipathy to it than to catch-all labels in 
the past. Picasso probably didn't like being called a Cubist, simply because it 
unfairly limited his identity. 
</P>
<P>
"But the word minimalism is eminently mockable. How many times do we hear the 
standard snipe: 'Minimal music for minimal minds?' " 
</P>
<P>
What Adams is eager to talk about is the genesis of the much-debased form. He 
explains it as a pendulum swing away from the forbidding 12-tone music of the 
Second Viennese School -- a revolt against Schoenberg and his disciples, who 
dominated compositional thought from the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
He sees music composition as having gone through cycles of complexity -- 
"inbreeding to extinction" -- followed by radical reappraisals of language. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Mozart," says the defender of populism. "His music was immensely 
simple compared to the Baroque style, which immediately preceded it, almost a 
contradiction to the kind of involved counterpoint Bach put forth. 
</P>
<P>
"But I still say that our critics, Wuorinen and his elite brotherhood, are 
torchbearers of High Art out of defensiveness. What's getting these guys so 
apoplectically mad is how loved our music is. Whether it, or any other music, 
has value though, no one can be sure of. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be an academic music, a theory music. We (minimalists) exist 
outside of it. Our important feedback comes from the people -- the ones who 
write letters expressing how profoundly affected they are by a piece. As for 
the future, we must hope that the swing does not go too far, that the love 
affair with popular culture does not become an end in itself."

George Perle: Minimalism's Numbers 'Mean Nothing to Me . . . I'm Not Counting' 
</P>
<P>
George Perle, now at UC Berkeley to deliver the prestigious Ernest Bloch 
lectures, takes a morning phone call. The nocturnal composer did not spend most 
of the night working as he often does. So he has the patience to explain that 
his music is accessible without being simplistic, that he is not guilty as 
charged of being an eat-your-peas academic. 
</P>
<P>
An invitation to jump into the fray is less than compelling, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I have little concern with telling people what to listen to and why. Do they 
like it?" asks the 74-year-old detester of minimalism. "Then let them go ahead. 
I won't sit in judgment." Perle takes the opposite stand of Wuorinen. Society 
will find its way, he believes. He need not be a standard-bearer for anyone but 
himself. Indeed, it is only with much cajoling that he addresses the 
minimalists and others who, he says, "have nothing new to say." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Glass, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
"What he writes is childish babble. It uses the most superficial aspect of an 
old musical language. People do not come out of the hall humming it because 
it's applied to visual events and doesn't stand alone. It's music for people 
who hate music and can only be looked at historically, as a reaction to the 
misunderstood 12-tone system, which created problems both for audiences and 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
"But surely those old harmonic relationships (Brahms and Beethoven) can find 
better means of preservation than the bare-bones formulas devised by the 
minimalists." 
</P>
<P>
Perle -- who, in his early research into the first 12-tone music, found his 
compositional niche -- has brought that 20th-Century language to a comfortably 
integrated place, one placing him in what he calls the mainstream. Whether that 
mainstream has 1,000 or 1,000,000 listeners swimming in it, though, is 
immaterial. 
</P>
<P>
"My approach is not concerned with popularity," he says, conceding minimalism's 
fascination for the masses. Numbers mean nothing to me. I'm not counting." 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to describe his pleasure over the world premiere of his "Windows of 
Order," presented by the Juilliard String Quartet in April in Washington's 
Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Beethoven crowd that filled the hall, people with a sincere and 
developed love for music. But if someone told me I could exchange this for a 
stadium mob of 10,000, I wouldn't make the trade off. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an elitist, though," says the esteemed author of contemporary music 
theory. "I come from a working-class background. My favorite novelist is Henry 
James." 
</P>
<P>
But, "I'm also inclined to go to a movie or turn on TV. I don't have to be 
serious about everything." 
</P>
<P>
The scholarly composer points to the enormous growth of music today -- 
including the recording industry, expanded numbers of live concerts, etc. -- 
that comes as a result of greater leisure time. Yet he sees an erosion of 
standards. And worse, "certain colleagues manipulating the public." 
</P>
<P>
"There are those in the business of feeding that public, who don't care about 
it or music -- only their own success. They appeal to trend-seekers and set 
themselves up as arbiters of trendiness. Who is truly on the side of the 
public? I think I am. Not because I'm a nice guy or want to be popular but 
because my music has integrated the 12-tone language into something accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between the complex and the complicated. Mozart was 
complex and so is our spoken language, with its elaborate grammar. But some 
serial music is only complicated. By that I mean artificial, not relevant. 
People think I'm more humane than Boulez, for example, which is hardly the 
point. My music is simply more coherent than his. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimalism is not the only thing I dislike, although some of its practitioners 
-- like Adams -- are more palatable than others. Quoting hundreds of bars of 
Mozart -- George Rochberg does this -- hardly counts as new music. And 
borrowing a dead language, the way (David) Del Tredici does, is no better. I 
don't want to get personal, but these composers gain no more of my sympathy 
than the Glasses of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"As for minimalism, I think it will grind itself out of existence. But 
something just as bad will take its place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
David del Tredici: Good Minimalist Music Will Bring Audiences Back 
</P>
<P>
David del Tredici, at 52, remembers having John Adams as a student in his music 
theory class at Harvard. He's also good friends with minimalist Steve Reich. 
But even this mild-mannered middleman among composers has a satiric epithet for 
Philip Glass: "He's Rossini without melody. I think his music is awful." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Del Tredici has considerable empathy for the minimal movement -- 
for he too belongs to a generation that defected from the hard-core atonality 
that was fashionable until the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember being thrilled by very dissonant music," he says. "Everything I 
wrote at first was in the voguish Schoenbergian mold. So my first attempt at 
tonal music was terrifying. But when I heard the wild roar of approval from the 
audience -- a far different thing from the respectful neutrality that typically 
greeted new works -- I knew it was a turning point." 
</P>
<P>
He's referring to his "Final Alice," an enormously popular piece jointly 
commissioned by the Big Six orchestras -- Los Angeles, New York, Cleveland, 
Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia -- for the 1976 Bicentennial celebrations. It 
earned him a Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
It also earned him an adjective that he is not fond of: accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a synonym for cheap," he says. "The word has a bad connotation. We all 
grew up with the attitude that immortality comes to those who write 'ahead of 
their time.' To be accessible is to lack the wherewithal for immortality. We 
consoled ourselves that no one in Beethoven's day could understand his late 
works. Therefore our music should be inaccessible. Hogwash!Everyone knew back 
then that even his difficult pieces were extraordinary. We've overdone the idea 
of 'ahead of his time.' 
</P>
<P>
"And now the reaction to it -- minimalism -- is also excessive." 
</P>
<P>
But if Del Tredici trembles at the thought of being called accessible, why does 
a somewhat forbidding George Perle crave such a label? 
</P>
<P>
"One man's accessible is another man's forbidding," says the easygoing 
neo-Romantic, who is accustomed to his current outside-the-academy rank as 
composer in residence at the N.Y. Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be a bad boy today, that is, an anti-scholar, you take up 
minimalism or what I embrace, neotonality. Neither of these has any place in 
the academic hierarchy. That, in itself, attests to their vitality! 
</P>
<P>
"Twelve-tone music has lost its thrill. It's a waning reality, an historical 
fact that doesn't mean anything now. Neither a Boulez nor a Stockhausen has any 
relevance today. But it still takes courage to walk away. Less courage for 
minimalists who are regarded as 'new.' The fact that they're boring is only a 
secondary consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Adams is trying to extend the horizons of minimalism. Steve Reich, acting like 
a spider under a rock, wants to hold onto its static subtleties. However, no 
honest person could deny the powerful influence of minimalism. It begets 
audiences and, in that, gives contemporary music a good name. Where 12-tone 
dissonance sent people fleeing, the best forms of minimalism are bringing them 
back."

PHILIP GLASS IN THE EYE OF THE STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philip Glass is a one-time student heretic who repudiated hardline 
compositional techniques in favor of the easy-access theater music he now 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
He is among the most sought-after composers of the day. 
</P>
<P>
At 52, he can be credited for selling out opera houses where his "Einstein on 
the Beach," "Satyagraha" and "Akhnaten" have been staged. 
</P>
<P>
A pied piper of sorts, he appeals to -- and indeed helped define -- a crossover 
generation looking for something more refined than Guns N' Roses but not quite 
so formalist as Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the criticism he has received from his colleagues, Glass 
says: 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's sad, all this name-calling, and I don't want to be drawn into it. 
But the genuine response from my audience offsets any criticism from the 
academic quarter. I'm out there in the real world of performance, a vital 
world. And maybe that's why, in spite of the nasty comments, my high opinion of 
their music doesn't change. The bottom line is: I can afford to feel this way."

THERE'S GUNS IN THEM THAR HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
JULIAN DOES A SLOW BOIL IN WAKE OF KILLINGS OVER GOLD MINING CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not in Julian. This sort of thing doesn't fit a mountain hamlet known for apple 
pie and friendly townsfolk. It's not a spot where blood should be spilled. 
</P>
<P>
But sure enough it happened. In a rugged gorge on the backside of town, a 
bearded young mountain man named Chris Zerbe set out on Memorial Day to roust 
some claim jumpers near a gold mine he tended. Joe Lopes, an affable old-timer 
with a gravelly voice and a penchant for drink, went along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't live to tell what happened next. Staccato gunfire rang through the 
hills. When help arrived, Zerbe lay mortally wounded. Lopes was already dead. 
</P>
<P>
None of it made much sense. The gunmen, an El Cajon family and friends, had 
filed a claim of their own to prospect on the mine site. Their intentions 
appeared innocent enough -- a day of picnicking, target practice and poking 
around the property. Then the deadly confrontation unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Family members contend they fired in self-defense when Zerbe sent a gunshot 
whizzing their way. Investigators, armed with only the survivors' side of the 
story, have yet to file charges or fully assess blame for the bloody standoff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tale From Days Past 
</P>
<P>
With its lingering mystery, the episode has blanketed this peaceful mountain 
town amid the pines with anxiety. It all seems a century too late, a throwback 
to the lawless days of the late 1800s, when gold was first discovered in these 
parts and Julian became a boom town. 
</P>
<P>
To some townsfolk, however, the slaying of Zerbe, 34, and Lopes, 66, appeared 
sadly emblematic of a simmering tension between locals and unruly urban 
visitors. Dubbed flatlanders, these outsiders from off the mountain have been 
accused of stirring up bad feelings, traipsing onto private property, 
vandalizing homes and shooting up the countryside. It's only a handful of bad 
apples, folks realize, but the problems are there all the same. 
</P>
<P>
"There is kind of a resentment. People from the city don't always respect the 
property rights out here," said Glen Larson, a boyhood friend of Zerbe. "During 
hunting season our ranchers have had cattle shot, they've had horses shot. 
These aren't local people doing it, they're people coming out of the city and 
they're a little bit trigger-happy. It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Larison, a bearded old sourdough who has lived in Julian much of his life, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of trouble all over these hills," said Larison. "They come up 
here with an arsenal. Sometimes they shoot two-, three-, four-hundred rounds. 
And if they don't take something, they tear it up." 
</P>
<P>
Tensions run particularly high these days among the handful of backcountry 
dwellers still attempting to work the patchwork of mineral claims spreading 
east from Julian's quaint, four-block downtown. Though little gold has been 
pulled from the hills in recent decades, these modern-day prospectors remain 
undeterred, driven by the shimmering hope of hitting some undiscovered mother 
lode. And they're serious about guarding their claims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Weekend Rambos with Guns' 
</P>
<P>
"Every weekend, this place is like a zoo, full of weekend Rambos with their 
guns," said Bruce Herrington, 53, a rough-shaven prospector living with his 
girlfriend and their kids on a mining claim in Chariot Canyon, six miles east 
of Julian. "What would they do if we went and threw out a picnic in their back 
yard and started shooting it up? They got no respect." 
</P>
<P>
Like other miners in the region, Herrington has made a routine of warning off 
intruders, particularly those intent on hunting for gold on his claim. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington chuckles as he recalls booting four visitors he recently discovered 
walking the property with a wooden divining rod in a vain search for 
underground treasure. Those people, like most, went peacefully. But some don't. 
</P>
<P>
A couple years back, a pack of men outfitted in camouflage fired shots over the 
heads of his children as the family bounced in a pickup along one of the rugged 
dirt roads leading onto the land. Herrington reached for the handgun he keeps, 
but his girlfriend, Davalene Hirsch, pulled him back. They drove on instead to 
report the incident to authorities, no easy task in this remote corner of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes us an hour to get the sheriff," Hirsch said, noting how the family 
must drive 20 minutes to reach the nearest telephone. "If it's a claim dispute, 
they tell us it's a civil matter. And they won't even come out here at night." 
</P>
<P>
Though the Memorial Day killings were the first bloodshed over a mining rights 
dispute in Julian since the region's heyday, even today's miners aren't shy 
about making a point with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Sonka, a writer who frequented the Julian area during his "hippie days" in 
the early 1970s, remembers well an episode of gunfire that erupted when he 
tried to assume several mining claims more than 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sonka was renting a ranch house across from the claims when shots rang out one 
night on the property. He hustled over to find bullet holes riddling the old 
mine cabin where his two children had been staying. The radiators in two 
pickups were also punctured by shotgun blasts. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, the kids and several others had moved outside near a pond to avoid the 
heat and weren't hit. But Sonka got the point. He abandoned his effort to seize 
the claims. 
</P>
<P>
"We reported it to the sheriff, but they said they didn't have any way of 
proving who it was," Sonka said. "We all sat around and talked about it and 
decided we didn't want to get in a shooting war." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muddled Mining Rights Law 
</P>
<P>
Just who has a legal right to tap the ore-rich federal lands remains a muddled 
matter. Mining rights stem from a timeworn 1872 law that, if anything, seems to 
provide fertile ground for disputes over claims. 
</P>
<P>
Under existing regulations, which are administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management, a prospector is awarded ownership of the land only if a mineral 
discovery is made that promises to be profitable. A miner who simply stakes a 
claim, meanwhile, has no more rights to the land than anyone else, be it for 
picnicking, target shooting or even prospecting, according to Richard Park, a 
BLM geologist. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone has a right to go on a mining claim as long as they don't interfere 
with an ongoing mining operation," Park said. "But many miners believe they've 
got exclusive rights to a claim. It's very difficult to convince them that this 
is the law because, by God, that's theirs and they're going to protect it come 
hell or high water." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to fundamentally rewrite the outdated law have been frustrated by 
elements within the mining industry, led by the influential American Mining 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Matters are further complicated because the BLM lacks a centralized network to 
cross-check and determine if an applicant is filing for land that is already 
claimed. Through the years, the result has been a bevy of claim disputes that 
can only be resolved in civil court. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens too often is the BLM doesn't concern itself with the validity of 
claims," said James Tweedy, one of two Los Angeles men who hired Zerbe as a 
caretaker for their claims. "It becomes a matter of fighting it out over who 
has a legitimate claim to a piece of property. Sometimes you fight it out in 
court. And sometimes, unfortunately, it's fought out by force." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case of Duplicate Claims 
</P>
<P>
The slayings on Memorial Day stemmed from just such a situation. Though the El 
Cajon family -- Gustave Hudson, his wife and their two teen-age children -- 
filed a claim, the area has been held for more than two decades by Tweedy, an 
attorney, and Benjamin Haimes, an import-export consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the BLM's Park said, the Hudsons had a right to go on the land 
because the current claim holders do not own the property. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the fatal shootings, investigators say, Zerbe confronted the 
family and demanded they leave. When Hudson showed him a copy of a county 
recorder's document, Zerbe left to call Haimes and report what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, however, he returned and the shooting erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing in the world worth any life," Haimes said. "Christopher was 
just doing his job. I feel they must have cornered him. They shot him to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the slayings are not sitting well with local residents. Many were 
troubled that no arrests were made. Others grumbled about a cover-up when 
sheriff's investigators refused because of concern for the Hudsons' safety to 
release the names of the El Cajon family, even after they appeared in area 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Some theorized that the case was being pushed aside by investigators because of 
the background of the shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barefoot Frontiersman 
</P>
<P>
Something of a loner, Zerbe looked every bit the part of a frontiersman, going 
barefoot much of the time and wearing his hair long, with a bandanna tied 
around his head. He developed a rapport with nature, to a point where he would 
only cut fallen timber and would chafe at shooting even a rabbit, friends and 
family say. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligent and mechanically gifted, he made ends meet with a variety of odd 
jobs in the area. His first love, however, was gold mining, an avocation he 
picked up as a boy exploring the beehive of mine tunnels near his home. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't see things the way we might, in the spirit of compromise," said his 
father, Richard, an architect and amateur historian. "He was given to seeing 
things as either black or white." 
</P>
<P>
Although his family has been a well-known and respected fixture in the 
community for years, Zerbe had several run-ins with law enforcement authorities 
in recent years. His father blames it on a confrontation Zerbe had with 
sheriff's deputies and park rangers after a traffic stop a few years ago. Ever 
since, police had harassed Zerbe repeatedly, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopes, meanwhile, was a likeable old ex-prizefighter. His round belly and white 
beard made him look like a department store Santa Claus, but his face was a 
battlefield of scars. Townsfolk say he was the sort that always had a good word 
to say, leaning on a beat-up pickup along downtown's main street and chatting 
with whoever passed by. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone liked him. He didn't have an enemy," said Larison, a longtime friend. 
"He drank, sure, but a lot of people drink and you don't call them a drunk." 
</P>
<P>
Larison, for one, can't believe that Zerbe would shoot at anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the type who might point one in the air and shoot for effect," he said. 
"But Chris would never point a gun at anyone. If he did, he'd hit them. He's 
not an expert, but he could hit someone from 100 feet with a 30-30." 
</P>
<P>
After the slayings, there was much talk in Julian about retaliating against the 
Hudsons, who refused to comment on the incident. Richard Zerbe said he preached 
restraint, expressing hope that the legal process will run its course. 
</P>
<P>
But the talk continues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's over," Larison said. "I'm not at liberty to say what it 
might be, but I feel something's going to happen. I just hope it's legal." 
</P>
<P>
Dee Baker, another local resident, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's at a slow boil right now," she said. "There are some people who say they 
just wish it would all go away. But others hope it doesn't go away. They want 
some finalization and some justice done here . . .. It's going to be a very 
edgy situation for a very long time."

MCRD REFUSED TO BOLT DOWN SODA MACHINES; 
</P>
<P>
MARINE KILLED 8 MONTHS AFTER BOTTLER WAS DENIED ACCESS TO RECRUIT DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A soft-drink machine that toppled onto and killed a 19-year-old Marine in San 
Diego last July was not bolted down because mid-level officials at the Marine 
Corps Recruit Depot had refused eight months earlier to do so, The Times has 
learned from documents obtained through the U. S. Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
Although an investigative report appears to lay blame for the accident on the 
victim, who had been drinking, the report also shows that officials at the base 
were aware for nearly two years before the fatality that Marines were tipping 
the vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
Two vending machine tip-overs injured Marines at the depot in 1986, and a year 
later the Navy began bolting down its machines nationwide. Navy and Marine 
publications during that time also carried warnings about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the recruit depot's safety committee discussed and then set aside 
the idea of bolting down the machines in November, 1986, because of concern 
about damaging the 1920s-era buildings at the base, the investigation by Marine 
1st Lt. Mark J. Griffith concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in late 1987, eight months before the fatal accident, "an unknown 
individual or individuals" refused to allow workers from the vending company to 
bolt down the machines, Griffith's report says. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of San Diego were turned away 
"because of the fact that the historical value of the buildings prevented them 
from anchoring any type of permanent bolts or studs into the floor or to the 
walls," according to a statement to the investigator by Lt. John T. Wolfe, 
assistant merchandise manager for the Marine Corps exchange system at the MCRD. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made despite the fact that the buildings' interiors have been 
updated into offices with carpets, ceiling tiles and other changes since their 
construction in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said in his report that the lengthy interval since the denial 
prevented him from determining who was responsible for the decision not to bolt 
the machines. Disciplinary action was "neither warranted nor contemplated," he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
However, even a week after the fatal accident, permission to bolt the machines 
was again denied by the depot's facilities division, and was granted only after 
the commanding general was notified of the denial by investigators, said Maj. 
Jerry Broeckert, public affairs officer at the depot. 
</P>
<P>
On July 31, 1988, nearly two years after the base safety committee first 
rejected the idea of securing the machines, Pvt. Michael R. Carlson lay 
groaning beneath a half-ton soft-drink machine in an MCRD recreation room. The 
machine had fallen onto him after he tipped it forward to coax out a soft-drink 
can. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson died on the operating table two hours later at the Navy Hospital in San 
Diego. Liver lacerations caused massive internal bleeding, according to the 
accident investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The accident added Carlson to the list of people, many of them in the military, 
who have been crushed by falling machines during the past several years. A U. 
S. Army physician reported 47 accidents, 11 of them fatal, on overseas bases 
since 1985. In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission knew 
of seven fatalities and 10 injuries by April, 1988, but it regards the figures 
as incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers and college students are other likely victims. A year ago, a 
15-year-old boy suffered two broken legs when a machine fell on him at Palomar 
Community College. 
</P>
<P>
The commission announced in April that Vendo Corp. of Fresno had agreed to 
modify the model of soft-drink machines whose design appeared to have 
contributed to the spate of accidents. In February, the secretary of the Navy 
ordered that by the end of the month all soft-drink machines on Navy property 
would have to be secured to prevent tipping. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that order, however, the Navy and the Marines were aware of the 
nationwide problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy Safety Center warned of the problem in a 1986 publication. In 
November, 1987, the San Diego naval command sent out a notice that, because of 
similar incidents at military bases nationwide, the Navy Exchange Service had 
ordered all its soda machines secured. The exchange service manages food and 
other retail services for the Navy, but not the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of Carlson's death emphasizes that the November message about 
securing the machines came from Commander Naval Base San Diego, whose messages 
are "not controlling over the Marine Corps Recruit Depot." The Marine Corps is 
under a separate command structure from the rest of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The message was received by the commanding general's office at the MCRD and was 
treated as an information message and sent on to all commanders and staff 
members, said Broeckert, the depot's public affairs officer. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why no action was taken to solve a known safety problem, Broeckert said, 
"A lot of times it takes a tragedy before something happens." 
</P>
<P>
He denied that the communique's underlying concerns were ignored because the 
message was not binding on the Marines, or that there was a lack of urgency 
concerning the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We teach two things from the beginning: accomplishment of the mission and 
safety of the troops," Broeckert said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when the contractor that supplies soda machines for both San 
Diego Navy bases and the MCRD tried to address the safety problem, it got 
nowhere. Using the San Diego naval commander's order as authorization, Pepsi 
Cola Bottling Co. sent workers to the recruit depot in late November or early 
December, 1987, to secure the machines, according to the investigation report. 
</P>
<P>
The workers were turned away by unidentified Marine officials because of 
concerns about damaging the buildings' historical value, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Broeckert said that, while it is now apparent that property damage was being 
given too much weight over safety, base officials were merely trying to protect 
federal property. He compared it to how a homeowner might react if the supplier 
of a home water cooler suddenly showed up with a drill ready to fasten the 
cooler to the kitchen floor. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd probably ask some questions. That's probably the process that went on 
here," Broeckert said. "Obviously, that wasn't the right answer, because since 
then we did it . . . based on safety concerns." 
</P>
<P>
The original buildings at the MCRD were built in 1921 and designed in Spanish 
colonial style by the same architect, Bertram Goodhue, who designed many of the 
distinctive buildings in Balboa Park, said George Kordela, curator of the MCRD 
Command Museum. 
</P>
<P>
They were followed by a World War II building boom of less significant 
structures, and then others, he said. But in many cases, an effort was made to 
match the style of the original, giving the depot's mustard-color buildings a 
distinctive, unified look of red tile roofs, decorative arches and stone 
adornments. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires military installations to consult with state authorities 
whenever they plan modifications affecting the historic characteristics of a 
building, said Dorene Clement, a state historian who works with that program in 
California. However, if a building's interior already has been extensively 
changed, further changes there are not considered to affect its historical 
characteristics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks of the accident that killed Carlson, Pepsi Cola renewed its 
offer to bolt down the machines at the MCRD, the investigation found. "The 
offer from Pepsi Cola to secure its machines to the decks and/or bulkheads 
should be accepted," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
After yet another denial of permission by the facilities division, all machines 
were bolted down within two months of Carlson's death, Broeckert said. The 
bolting was done at the order of the commanding general at the time, Maj. Gen. 
Donald Fulham, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigative report's account of Carlson's accident paints a picture of a 
troubled, homesick young Marine who was within a month of being discharged from 
the service because of adjustment problems. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Carlson, of Ishpeming, Mich., drank too much at a Camp Pendleton 
beach picnic the Sunday he was killed. Other Marines had to put him into his 
bunk after the group arrived back at MCRD about 7:30 p.m., the investigative 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson napped for about an hour, then asked a friend to go with him to the 
depot's bowling alley to get a pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
That was the last anyone saw of Carlson until a loud crash awoke Pfc. John G. 
Zilbert as he lay sleeping on a couch in the Building 2 West recreation room. 
It was about 8:40 p.m., and Zilbert saw that the soft-drink machine had toppled 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Zilbert and two Marines who were passing by the room rushed over to help. 
</P>
<P>
"I jumped up and turned around, and saw someone had apparently pulled the Pepsi 
machine over and it had landed on top of him," Zilbert told the Navy's 
investigator. " . . . I could see his chest, approximately from his shoulders 
up, that was not under the machine. He was saying he couldn't breathe, for us 
to get it, the machine, off, that he was hurting, and that it, the machine, 
took his money. He repeated that several times while we were lifting the 
machine off of him and while we . . . were waiting for the ambulance." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes later, Carlson was at the Navy Hospital in Balboa Park, still 
conscious and talking but complaining of severe abdominal pain, witnesses said. 
Within minutes, however, doctors had to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 
give him seven pints of blood because of internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to the operating room 48 minutes after arriving at the hospital, 
and died there 36 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Before the accident, it had become common knowledge at the depot that, if the 
machines were tipped and rocked, one could receive a soft drink without paying, 
Marines at the depot told the accident investigator. This was also used as a 
solution when coins were inserted but the machine failed to dispense a soda. 
</P>
<P>
It was that trait of 111,000 Vendo machines made between 1982 and 1985 that led 
to the Consumer Product Safety Commission action in April. Nationwide, the 
machines are to be equipped internally with a plastic device that makes free 
sodas impossible. Warning stickers are also to be placed on the outside of the 
machines. At the MCRD, all machines are bolted to the floor, but they bear no 
safety stickers. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, some doctors within San Diego County's system of 
trauma hospitals expressed concern that Carlson's life could have been saved if 
he had been taken to a civilian trauma hospital for specialized emergency care. 
Trauma centers at UC San Diego Medical Center and Mercy Hospital and Medical 
Center are closer to the Marine depot than the Navy hospital. 
</P>
<P>
However, Carlson's injuries were so severe that he would have had only a 
slightly better chance of survival at a trauma center, said Dr. Steven 
Shackford, trauma center director at UCSD Medical Center. Shackford, a former 
Navy surgeon, said he had reviewed the medical details of the Carlson case at 
the Navy's request. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, San Diego military personnel who have sustained traumatic injuries 
go to the Navy Hospital, unless the accidents occur off base. However, Marines 
who are seriously injured at Camp Pendleton frequently are airlifted to San 
Diego trauma units instead of the Navy Hospital, Shackford said.

OUTLOOK IMPROVES FOR ORANGE COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two multimillion-dollar dam projects in West Virginia may help Orange County 
squeeze $20 million out of Congress to finally begin construction of the 
long-delayed Santa Ana River flood-control project. 
</P>
<P>
Approved 2 1/2 years ago, but not yet financed, the Santa Ana River project has 
been designated a top priority by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The agency 
has declared the Santa Ana River the worst flood threat west of the 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the House of Representatives, seeking to trim the federal budget 
deficit, decided against financing any of the agency's new water projects, 
including the Santa Ana River venture. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, officials working to get financing for the massive Santa Ana 
River undertaking, which is expected to cost nearly $1.4 billion and take years 
to complete, said they are encouraged about the prospects for beginning 
construction in the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, for fiscal year '89, Congress did not fund any new projects. We 
believe that was only a one-year policy," said David C. Kenyon, acting chief of 
the programs division of the Army Corps of Engineers' civil works directorate. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very optimistic that we will end the moratorium on new starts this year," 
said Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a member of the House Appropriations 
Committee's energy and water subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the new optimism is the corps' inclusion high on its proposed 
funding list this year of two projects in West Virginia -- $17.9 million to 
replace an old dam-and-lock system on the Monongahela River and $20.8 million 
for a similar project on the Kanawha River. 
</P>
<P>
Those two projects, which were not in last year's proposal, are expected to 
provide a special incentive to a key player in the funding process, Sen. Robert 
C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), to clear the logjam over new money for flood control. Byrd 
is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the energy 
and water subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"That was smart thinking on their (the corps') part," said James F. McConnell, 
Orange County's lobbyist in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland), a leading supporter of the Santa Ana project, 
said, "I'm not sure that the corps has (made) those sorts of links." However, 
he added: "Stranger things have happened in the business of making sausage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expresses Reservations 
</P>
<P>
Approval by the Senate Appropriations Committee is seen as a major hurdle for 
the project. Last month, Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.), ranking minority 
member of the Senate panel, publicly expressed reservations about beginning new 
water projects if long-term financing cannot be assured. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the project believe that the House will be more receptive to 
flood-control fund requests. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Orange County's congressional delegation said Fazio and Lewis are 
leading the lobbying push for the Santa Ana River project, which is designed to 
ease the danger of disastrous flooding in Lewis' San Bernardino County 
district, as well as Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps of Engineers has estimated that in the kind of flood disaster that 
might occur every 200 years, the rising river could kill as many as 3,000 
people and cause as much as $11 billion in property damage over its 100-mile 
course from the mountains in San Bernardino County to the ocean near Newport 
Beach. The river slices through about 30 miles of Orange County's most densely 
populated urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
During recent hearings before the energy and water subcommittee, Lewis urged 
the panel to approve $32 million to begin the flood-control work. That request 
was endorsed by the full Orange County congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Help' 
</P>
<P>
"We've had tremendous help from the members" from Orange County, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect that in the next week or two, the subcommittee will receive 
word from the full Appropriations Committee on how much money it may spend on 
water projects. Once that figure is known, prospects for the Santa Ana project 
will become clearer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although a number of members have requested that we appropriate more for the 
project than (the $20 million) in the President's budget, it is too early to 
determine whether we will be able to augment that amount," Fazio said. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, in an interview, said he has repeatedly raised the issue with the 
subcommittee chairman, Rep. Tom Bevill (D-Ala.). "The man who's got more 
leverage on this knows firsthand that we're going to have thousands of our 
citizens dead if this doesn't go through," Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said: "I consider it to be a crucial year as far as the project's chance 
of coming forward. The next four or five years don't look easy in terms of 
budget considerations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Begin Building Dam 
</P>
<P>
The $20 million requested this year would allow the corps to begin constructing 
a new dam in San Bernardino County on the upper Santa Ana River, to be called 
the Seven Oaks Dam, and pay for other preliminary engineering and design work. 
The new dam would be 550 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the $20 million would pay for acquisition of wetlands near the 
mouth of the Santa Ana River to provide protection for two birds -- the 
California least tern and Belding's sparrow, whose habitats would be endangered 
by the project. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the project would raise the level of Prado Dam by 36 feet to 
accommodate storage of an additional 195,000 acre-feet of water and upgrade 
flood channels along the Santa Ana River and Santiago Creek. Included would be 
major improvements to the Talbert Channel, the failure of which led to 
widespread damage in the 1983 floods. Some channels would be lined with 
concrete, while others would be graded and widened. 
</P>
<P>
All but $364 million of the total project cost of nearly $1.4 billion would be 
paid by the federal government.

ABORTION DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, when reporting the anti-abortionists' illegal blockade of medical 
facilities ("82 Arrested Protesting Abortions," June 11), the focus was on the 
blockaders and the police, and not on the patients whose rights were being 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter if these patients were seeking abortions, prenatal care or 
even a routine gynecological examination. All patients have a right to see 
their physicians at their scheduled time. They have a right to privacy, free of 
any harassment by self-appointed zealots who believe they know what is best for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Under the cover of "religion," these anti-abortion activists are endangering 
not only the lives and well-being of women, but also the rights of each one of 
us. Today they don't approve of abortion; tomorrow, it may be voluntary 
sterilization. Where does this harassment end? How many men would like the 
world to know that they are visiting their urologist to have a vasectomy? 
</P>
<P>
The "right to privacy" in the physician-patient relationship is cherished by 
all Americans. It is time each of us speaks up for that right. If we don't, we 
may all lose it.

<P>
HAS THE COUNCIL FORGOTTEN ABOUT HONOR AND ETHICS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BUTLER, Ed Butler is a retired state Court of Appeal justice. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Old West, people used to say that a man's word was as good as his bond. 
In the new San Diego, a City Council promise seems to be as good as a junk bond 
issued by a bankrupt savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the San Diego City Council confirmed the nominations of 15 men and 
women to serve on a Charter Review Commission. Their job was to review the 
city's charter and propose changes to be put before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the council declared: 
</P>
<P>
"That this council fully acknowledges and declares that all recommendations 
made by the commission shall be placed directly on the ballot without further 
council directive . . . (except for the actions required to place matters on 
the ballot)." 
</P>
<P>
We insisted on the commitment as a condition to our acceptance of a year of 
unpaid effort to review the charter, hear and debate proposals for change and 
make our recommendations to the people for charter revision. 
</P>
<P>
We declined to serve as an advisory committee to the council. We worked as an 
independent citizens review board. While appointed by the mayor and council, we 
were not puppets to be jerked around by the strings. 
</P>
<P>
Our work produced 14 ballot proposals. The first, a recommendation for a police 
review board with broad investigative powers, went on the ballot last year 
after acrimonious council debate regarding the council's commitment. 
</P>
<P>
The review board proposal won a majority vote, but lost by a narrow margin to a 
rival measure sponsored by the council. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 13 proposals went before the council last week with what now 
seems a predictable result: Five members reneged on their promise to put our 
charter revision proposals to a vote of the people. The package of proposals 
was DOA -- dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
I call the roll: Ed Struiksma, Bruce Henderson, Judy McCarty, Ron Roberts and 
Gloria McColl. Only Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Wes Pratt and Bob Filner were true 
to the council's commitment. (Abbe Wolfsheimer was absent.) 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the commission, I regret the year we spent hammering out charter 
revisions to enable local government structure to cope with the challenges of 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
As a citizen, I am saddened by this gross disregard of simple precepts so 
essential to the functioning of government at all levels: honor, ethics, 
trustworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush sets ethical standards for Washington public officials -- 
principles of right and wrong governing conduct. Five members of our City 
Council do not hear, or heed, that trumpet call. No wonder voter turnout at 
elections is low. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is clear: Require candidates for office to demonstrate those 
qualities of trustworthiness we all recognize in everyday life. Positions on 
issues are important. Personal qualities and beliefs in those ancient 
principles of right conduct are more important. 
</P>
<P>
The curtain has dropped on the first act of this 20th-Century morality play. 
Other acts will follow because the times demand that we restructure our form of 
city government. The 1931 charter was carefully tailored to fit a small city 
with a military-based economy -- white hats and tattooed sailors on lower 
Broadway, one high-rise office building, the Convair plant on Pacific Highway. 
Public office was a part-time civic duty. The office of mayor was ceremonial 
and a secretary served as staff for the City Council, which was nominated by 
district and elected at large. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager was just that. He ran the city and elected officials kept out 
of his way. 
</P>
<P>
Look at San Diego in 1989 and study the forecasts for the '90s and into the 
21st Century. Sixth-largest city in the country. A skyline of high-rises. Well 
over a million residents. High-tech industry. Traffic congestion a la Los 
Angeles. Billion-dollar sewage problems. Rampant growth. 
</P>
<P>
The 1931 charter simply cannot cope with the brave new world. Amended over the 
years, council offices are full time with large staffs and a total budget of 
more than $3 million, often used to second-guess and overrule the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
I foresee petty principalities vying with each other and the mayor for power. 
</P>
<P>
To me, these proposals are imperative: Increase the mayor's power, create an 
independent redistricting commission to form council districts. Limit council 
power to changing park uses and selling city land. Redefine the role of the 
city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Charter Review Commission proposals move the city in those directions. The 
people deserve the right to vote on them. And all of us have the right to 
demand that the City Council fulfill its commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Honor, ethics, trustworthiness are principles to be carried on banners -- not 
trailed in the dust.

DOG FINDS A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wish to publicly express my sincere thanks to the editors of the Los Angeles 
Times for printing my letter ("To 'Loving Owner' " May 21) regarding the 
abandoned chow-like dog on Otay Lakes Road. 
</P>
<P>
I have been able to learn that the dog is well and has found a loving owner. I 
want to share the story with you. 
</P>
<P>
I received a call from Kevin, who lives less than a mile from me -- he had 
successfully enticed "Red" into his car. This was accomplished with pizza and 
tender words of encouragement and patience. How wonderful! I immediately placed 
a sign ("I found a happy home. Thanks for your loving care. Red Chow Dog") next 
to the tin container along the roadway for the people who were still delivering 
food to the dog. Even though the dog had not been seen for several days, the 
food was faithfully delivered -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, I received a call from Kathy, the "young lady in the white 
camper." She had seen the article in the paper, made copies of it and had 
collected money for food. Finding that the dog had a home, she now wanted to 
deliver it to the new owner. 
</P>
<P>
"Red" is now in Chula Vista with a loving family, children and a big, safe 
yard. Kathy delivered food, was greeted warmly by her dog friend, and took 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
To all of those who took part in this story, thank you on behalf of the red, 
chow-like dog.

SOME LATINO PARENTS PREFER ENGLISH, SHUN BILINGUAL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yolanda Granados knows that Southern California employers value workers who 
speak both English and Spanish. So she wants her son, Luis, to grow up 
bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
But when Luis started kindergarten last fall at Glenwood School in Sun Valley, 
most of the instruction he received was in Spanish. Granados worried that, as a 
result, he would fall behind in English. She asked school officials to change 
her son's classroom assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Many Latino parents are surprised when they find out that much, and in some 
cases most, of the instruction in a bilingual classroom is in Spanish, said 
Gloria Soto, a parent activist at Glenwood. But, she said, school officials 
discourage such parents from requesting a change to a classroom where English 
predominates. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents . . . ask what they can do if they don't want their child in the 
bilingual program," Soto said. "I tell them that if they don't want their child 
in the program, then sign them out." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Soto organized a group of Glenwood parents to march at the school in 
support of Sally Peterson, the Glenwood kindergarten teacher who founded the 
group Learning English Advocates Drive. LEAD members argue that teaching in 
English, with assistance from an aide fluent in the students' native language, 
hastens their progress in speaking English. 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles Unified School District's master plan for bilingual 
education is built on the principle that students are best taught in their 
native language, with daily doses of English instruction. When students able to 
read and write in their native language become fluent in English, those skills 
easily transfer to the new language, the district maintains. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal laws require that parents be allowed to choose from the 
different language approaches. At Glenwood -- as at many schools -- the 
parents' right to choose has become something of a tug-of-war between 
educators. 
</P>
<P>
"They brainwash parents," said Linda Meier, coordinator of the school's 
bilingual program, referring to Peterson and the other three Glenwood teachers 
affiliated with LEAD. "They literally tell the parents that the reason their 
children cannot read is because of the bilingual program, and this is not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
But Peterson said Meier and other school district officials attempt to coerce 
parents into keeping their children in bilingual classes. At some schools, she 
said, a videotape is shown in which happy children are speaking Spanish and 
tearful children are speaking English. "This kind of harassment and duress is 
an insult to parents," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
When they start school, students with Hispanic surnames are tested to determine 
whether they are fluent in English. But the tests are so flawed that many who 
do not need bilingual instruction -- including some born in the United States, 
whose parents do not speak Spanish -- are put in the classes, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meier denied that parents are coerced. "I would never do that to a parent 
because it's not my child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meier and Peterson agreed, however, that Latino culture causes many parents to 
be deferential to teachers, making the parents vulnerable to manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 of Glenwood's 800 students speak limited English. Meier said about 
100 of these students, including all of those in Peterson's kindergarten class, 
have been assigned at their parents' request to "individual learning plans," 
where children are taught in English. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Individual Learning Plans 
</P>
<P>
Districtwide, 22% of the 120,000 limited-English-speaking elementary school 
students are assigned to individual learning plans. But only 13% of those 
students participate in the plans at their parents' request. The other 9% are 
assigned to the programs because bilingual classes are unavailable at their 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Granados, a former executive secretary, said it took several telephone calls, 
several visits to the school and a meeting with the coordinator of Glenwood's 
bilingual program to get her son's classroom assignment changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind my kid learning Spanish," Granados said, but not at the expense 
of learning in English. She speaks mostly Spanish to Luis, and her husband, 
Luis Sr., speaks English to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's Latino, but he was born in this state," she said of her son. "I want him 
learning the language that is going to help him in this state." 
</P>
<P>
Meier said that since LEAD's founding, many parents have asked to remove their 
children from the bilingual program. "I had to insist that these parents get 
properly informed" about the program, she said. "Some of the stories they come 
in with, I can see that they are totally confused." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, however, complained that Meier's counseling about the language 
instruction options has been one-sided. As a result, Peterson is the only 
teacher at the school allowed to counsel parents about where their students are 
placed. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Dominguez, whose son Mariano is a student in Peterson's class, speaks 
only Spanish. But Dominguez said through a translator that she wants her son to 
be taught in English. She said she was asked about placing him in a bilingual 
class, but refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it the way it is," she said. "He's happy, and he's learning very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Soto, who did not learn Spanish in school but picked it up later, said she and 
the other parents in her group think that bilingual education is necessary for 
students who speak no English. But such students should be quickly moved into 
classes taught in English, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The administration truly believes that what they're trying to do is best," 
Soto said. "But I would like them to come to individual schools and talk to 
parents and see what the parents want."

LAWNDALE WEIGHS 6 CITY JOBS AGAINST MORE POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The fate of six Lawndale city workers targeted for layoffs will be decided 
Monday when the City Council meets for a public hearing on the city's proposed 
$7.8-million budget for 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 during a seven-hour meeting Thursday to spend $313,696 
next year to pay for two 40-hour-a-week sheriff's patrols and two non-uniformed 
community service officers who will assist in taking reports. This will bring 
the city's law enforcement costs to $2.2 million, about 28% of the budget in 
the 2-square-mile city. 
</P>
<P>
To come up with the money, the council has made substantial cuts in all 
departments at four budget workshops in the last two weeks. But with the added 
law enforcement costs, the council needs to cut $117,000 more to balance the 
budget and provide a $100,000 reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Layoffs are the most likely way to cut large sums from the budget, according to 
Acting City Manager Jim Arnold. He targeted six workers for layoffs after the 
council on May 4 voted 4 to 1 to hire more law enforcement personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The six are community safety officer Paul Jordan, a 17-year employee; 
administrative analysts Marsha Schutte and Grace-Marie Johnston, both 12-year 
employees; community information officer Ken Huthmaker, eight years; assistant 
planner Lola Unger, two years, and one of two administrative assistants in the 
community development department, Valerie Armstrong or Vivian Smith. Armstrong 
has already quit. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours of Thursday's marathon meeting was devoted to debate on whether 
the city should hire more deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Maxwell, a city recreation commissioner, presented petitions with 200 
signatures asking the council to beef up law enforcement in response to a 
recent increase in graffiti and gang activity. He said the deputies should be 
hired "even if six bureaucrats must give up their positions." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents, including developer Jonathan Stein, said the city needs "cops, 
cops and more cops," while others, including artist Dan Eisner, questioned 
whether the city was caught up in emotionalism in response to a 2% to 5% 
increase in crime reported by Sheriff's Capt. Walt Lanier. The council needs to 
ask whether more deputies will really solve the crime problem, Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Lawndale had the highest per-capita expenditure for law enforcement of 
all California contract cities with a population of 25,000 or more, according 
to a study published in the June issue of Western City, the magazine of the 
League of California Cities. The 1985 figures were the most recent available 
when the study was made. The article was discussed at the council meeting and 
circulated in City Hall. Contract cities are those that hire outside agencies 
such as the Sheriff's Department to provide law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$98.27 Per Person 
</P>
<P>
According to the article by Stephen K. Blumberg, professor at the Graduate 
Center for Public Policy at Cal State Long Beach, Lawndale spent $98.27 a 
person for law enforcement in 1985 while others, such as Temple City, spent as 
little as $36.11. The average among the contract cities was $53.21. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Rudolph, an advocate of increased law enforcement, took issue 
with Blumberg's findings. He said that in the current fiscal year, the city's 
per-capita spending for law enforcement is $73. Rudolph said he arrived at this 
figure by dividing the $1.9 million spent by the city's population of 26,000. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the expense, he said, "as long as there is crime in the city we 
don't have enough police." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Rudolph, Harold E. Hofmann and Dan McKenzie voted Thursday to spend 
$313,696 more on law enforcement, while Mayor Sarann Kruse and Councilwoman 
Carol Norman voted against. Kruse and Norman said they are not opposed to more 
law enforcement but are concerned about the cuts in services and personnel that 
would be needed to accomplish it. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse proposed hiring one deputy and two aides for $178,680, $135,016 less than 
the two-deputy plan, but was unable to obtain support from a majority. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse also suggested a few weeks ago that the city could hire eight civilian 
officers to serve as the "eyes and ears" of the community in detecting crime, 
but Lanier said the Sheriff's Department found this plan unworkable. The 
civilian workers could be put into dangerous situations that would require the 
skills of a trained, armed deputy, he said.

GROUP TO PRESS FOR DURING-SCHOOL MUSIC CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nonprofit Friends of School Music will ask the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
Unified School District on Monday to reinstate instrumental music classes 
during the school day at the district's eight elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
The group is conducting a letter-writing campaign, warning that a Board of 
Education decision to provide instrumental music classes after school, rather 
than during the school day, would cause "far-reaching damage" to the district's 
music program. Parents are being asked to write to the board to express their 
views on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Members will press for reinstatement of school-day music classes when the Board 
of Education meets Monday to adopt its tentative budget for 1989-90. The 7 p.m. 
board meeting will be at the district's Valmonte Administration Center, 3801 
Via La Selva, Palos Verdes Estates. The board is not expected to adopt a final 
budget until September. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education decided earlier this year to provide after-school 
instrumental music instruction for educational and budgetary reasons, district 
officials said Friday. The district expects to save at least $65,000 next year 
in salaries and other costs by offering classes after school. 
</P>
<P>
The after-school program will start in the fall at two locations -- the former 
Pedregal Elementary School on the west side of the peninsula, and either Mira 
Catalina Elementary School or Miraleste High School on the east side, according 
to district spokeswoman Nancy Mahr. In addition, ensemble playing will 
occasionally be offered after school at all eight elementary schools, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brigitte Schuegraf, president of Friends of School Music, said that 
participation would drop from current levels of 500 to 550 students if the 
instruction was after school, when music would have to compete with other 
extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
An after-school program, especially one not at the student's home school, 
"would reduce enrollment so drastically that the secondary-level music classes 
would eventually face extinction," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop a moment and picture future school and community events -- football 
games, musicals, parades, band and orchestra concerts -- without a band or 
orchestra," she said. Cutting back on elementary music instruction would be 
"like cutting a tree off at the roots," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mahr said that until now, the district has offered a "pull-out" music program 
at all eight elementary schools. Under the program, students have been taken 
out of their regular classes for music lessons at their home school. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever possible, students are removed from non-academic classes such as 
physical education, Mahr said. But sometimes, because two teachers must divide 
their time among eight schools, students must be taken out of academic classes, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Board members and state officials are concerned that students may be missing 
required studies, Mahr said. "Classroom pull-out is a very major issue" among 
educators, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mahr noted that music is only one of many school programs affected by a 
continuing decrease in state funding. District enrollment has declined from 
about 18,000 in 1973 to 9,320 today, and state funding to the district has 
diminished accordingly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989-90 fiscal year, the district expects to receive $30.6 million from 
state and local sources, compared to $31.8 million for 1988-89, Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of the revenue decline, the district had to slash $1.1 million 
from its list of desired programs for the 1989-90 school year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's after-school program, which will be paid for by the district, is 
expected to cost about $36,000, compared to $101,000 for the current program, 
Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
A district survey showed that about 250 families would be interested in 
participating in an after-school program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Friends of School Music and other music organizations contend that 
after-school programs do not attract enough attendance to succeed in the long 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been our observation over the years that music programs offered before 
and after the school day plainly do not work," said Wayne W. Nelson, president 
of the Southern California School Band and Orchestra Assn., in a letter to the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of 'extra' time instruction becomes one of elitism, whereby those 
who can afford the transportation benefit for a while, but the inconvenience of 
early/late pickups soon causes parents and students to drop out. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Six members of the South Bay branch of the Music Teachers' Assn. said in their 
letter that programs in districts that have tried the before- and after-school 
approach have failed "after about one year." In addition, they questioned why 
music should be assigned a secondary status: "Should it not be welcomed into 
the curriculum, rather than (being) banned to the unofficial, unacknowledged, 
unimportant non-school times as now planned?" 
</P>
<P>
Schuegraf and the Friends group also criticized the new after-school program 
because it would use non-credentialed teachers rather than credentialed 
teachers from the district. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said the teachers -- professional musicians and music 
teachers from the South Bay Conservatory, a private school in Rancho Palos 
Verdes -- are qualified. They simply don't have a teaching credential for 
public schools, Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends organization, which since its founding in 1979 has donated $180,000 
to the district, has helped pay for elementary instrumental music classes in 
the district for the past four years. The group also sponsors the Palos Verdes 
Elementary Honors Orchestra.

Porter Ranch Development Co. wants to build about 3,000 residences and 7.5 
million square feet of commercial space in the Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth. 
A citizens advisory committee helped shape the $2-billion proposal, but many 
nearby residents are opposed. The issue is to be considered by a Los Angeles 
City Council board on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Gendernalik, 51, is vice chairman of the citizens advisory committee that 
helped shape the Porter Ranch proposal. An independent developer, he lives in 
Northridge with his wife, Maria. The Gendernaliks have two college-aged 
children, Mark and Kim. He argues that the project, and the various measures 
required of the developer to counter its effects, would serve to improve the 
quality of life in the northern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Perhaps the biggest issue is how this development would affect traffic. 
Wouldn't the office buildings and residences make traffic worse? 
</P>
<P>
A. No one is saying that it is not going to add traffic. What we're saying is 
that the level of service, which is a term for measuring how smoothly traffic 
flows, will be better after the project is completed 30 years from now than it 
is today. Without the project, you would have gridlock at virtually every 
intersection in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Q. There is no doubt the area is going to be developed. But wouldn't measures 
to improve traffic be required, no matter what development occurs? 
</P>
<P>
A. No, I don't think so. The property is not under single ownership. And if the 
current plan were not developed, and each of those owners were allowed to build 
what current zoning allows, then we would end up with a lot more severe traffic 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The principle is that, if you've got one developer who puts in 25 houses and 
have another who puts 100 and another who puts in whatever, the city does not 
have the legal tools to compel them to provide the improvements we are 
requiring under the specific plan for this project, which will become part of 
the Porter Ranch-Chatsworth District Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What justifies the large amount of commercial development contemplated in 
this specific plan? 
</P>
<P>
A. I take some exception to the term "justifies." Everything we recommended was 
based, first, on traffic studies. None of us on the committee wanted to create 
anything negative within the area where we all lived. 
</P>
<P>
We started with traffic numbers, and forecasts for the demand for commercial 
and office space over the next 30 years, and -- based on that information -- we 
felt the projected commercial-office-retail space was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
However, we specifically stated that all the commercial development would be 
geared to: One, the development of the residential areas. Two, the completion 
of all the traffic studies. Three, the improvements we wanted to the Simi 
Valley Freeway. And four, maintaining the level of service on the streets in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the issue of balancing jobs and housing to reduce traffic? 
According to one analysis, roughly 90% of the automobile trips created by the 
development would be non-local and would, therefore, add to surrounding 
traffic? 
</P>
<P>
A. The longest distance traffic bringing people to the 7.5 million square feet 
of commercial space would come is in the 6.5-mile to 7-mile range. There were 
exceptions to that. Some traffic would come from Moorpark, Westlake Village, 
Calabasas. But that accounted for less than 10%, or even less than 5%, of the 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest thing about traffic that people overlook is that there is already 
an awful lot of traffic in the north San Fernando Valley, and in the 
Chatsworth-Porter Ranch Specific Plan area in particular, that comes from west 
of Topanga Canyon Boulevard. We're dealing with a condition being put upon us 
by neighboring communities, and we're saying to the developer, if you want to 
build up here, fix this other guy's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why wouldn't something as large as the proposed Porter Ranch project create 
as much traffic as a development such as Warner Center or Century City? 
</P>
<P>
A. People would go there. But traffic problems are caused by customers, 
patrons, who would come for the retail portion, not for the office space. And 
the retail is only about 1.25 million square feet. Far and away, the majority 
of the space up there is going to be office space, and that's nothing but one 
trip in and one trip out. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Could you describe the residential portion of the project? 
</P>
<P>
A. We wanted this to be as low a density residential development as we could 
achieve. To that end, we specified minimum lot sizes. Some of the lots are 
designated as horse-keeping. The streets will have houses only on one side of 
the street, not two sides. 
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, we won't have this tract house look. It will 
look as though every effort has been made to retain the rural feel of those 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
This was achieved by the committee saying "We've got a clean slate here. What 
do we want to see built?" This was not something that was put together on a 
whim. That is the principal reason why there is going to be a community center. 
And an amphitheater, and an Equity theater. That is certainly not the idea that 
the developer came to us with. 
</P>
<P>
In the commercial part of it, there will be more open space than at Warner 
Center. When Warner Center is built out, it will be like Century City. Garbage. 
We're not going to have that. I don't see how anybody could oppose this. It's 
better than anything anywhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some examples of the traffic system improvements that would be 
required to reduce the impact of traffic from the project? 
</P>
<P>
A. A number of intersections would be computer-controlled. Streets widened. 
Dual left-turn lanes would be built, left-turn signals installed. On some 
streets, the parking lanes would be used for traffic during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
These measures will be required on intersections from the northernmost point of 
the development to Roscoe on the south and from Topanga Canyon on the west to 
Balboa on the east. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The opponents say they are not opposed to development, but they don't want 
to see their quality of life made worse. How would you respond to such 
concerns? 
</P>
<P>
A. If we built this, the quality of life would improve. It would improve by 
virtue of the fact that when this development is completed, with all of the 
mitigating measures, traffic problems will be better than they are today. 
</P>
<P>
So, if the quality of life is acceptable now, then if it is improved, it ought 
to be more acceptable. And the only way that can happen is if we compel the 
developers to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Without the mitigating measures, you'd have a zoo, gridlock, downtown New York 
City. And that's not right, and I wouldn't support it. But that's exactly 
what's going to happen if this project is not developed. Because it will go 
someplace else, as sure as I am sitting here.

Porter Ranch Development Co. wants to build about 3,000 residences and 7.5 
million square feet of commerical space in the Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth. 
A citizens advisory committee helped shape the $2-billion proposal, but many 
nearby residents are opposed. THe issue is to be considered by a Los Angeles 
City Council board on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Chipello, 46, is director of the PRIDE neighborhood organization. PRIDE 
believes the proposed amount of office and retail space is disproportionately 
large and would cause traffic gridlock in the northern San Fernando Valley, 
among other problems. A professional musician, he lives with his wife, Diana, 
and their two children, Jennifer, 10, and Mark, 6, near Castlebay Lane School. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's at stake here? 
</P>
<P>
A. Basically what's at stake is whether we want this to become more like West 
L.A. or to stay more like the vision that people have had of Porter Ranch as a 
largely residential area. 
</P>
<P>
That wouldn't exclude a reasonable amount of commercial development. But I 
don't think 12- to-15-story buildings are in character for the area either. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the quality of life is pretty good in the north Valley. My children 
walk to school. They play at Porter Ridge Park, which is on Sesnon Boulevard, 
right next to Aliso Canyon. It's a very nice area for jogging, bike riding and 
equestrians. It's a quiet neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
If it were developed as proposed, the biggest problems are obviously going to 
be crime, traffic congestion, pollution and a loss of the residential 
character. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What would your organization like to see happen? 
</P>
<P>
A. We support the District Plan for development, the one drawn up in 1974. I 
don't know if it's clear to people that we support residential development. And 
we support commercial development commensurate with the District Plan. 
</P>
<P>
We realize that the area has been targeted for development for a long time. So 
the issue to us really is that the developer's plan treats the District Plan 
like it no longer exists. They did not start with an existing plan and then 
negotiate a proposal that exceeded that. They just threw it out. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What level of development would the District Plan allow? 
</P>
<P>
A. The District Plan allows a maximum of about 4,200 residences, which is 
reasonably in keeping with the 3,000 that have been proposed. But our concern 
really is the level of commercial development. The environmental impact report 
for Porter Ranch calculates that the District Plan allows 1.3 million square 
feet of commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
That figure is way under the 7.7 million square feet that the developer wants. 
That is the size of five Northridge Malls stacked one on top of the other. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Wouldn't the proposed commercial development provide jobs and housing for 
people who live in that area, making it possible for them not to commute as far 
as they do now? 
</P>
<P>
A. The greatest claim of the developer and Councilman Hal Bernson for a project 
of this size is that they need to provide more jobs in a housing-rich area and 
that this would reduce traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Assn. of Governments says that right now the jobs and 
housing in the area seem balanced, contrary to the claims of the developer. The 
concept of jobs-housing balance is one of the major tools to control air 
quality and transportation, by, in effect, locating people closer to their 
places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
And they say this proposal is throwing the jobs-housing ratio out of balance, 
because it calls for creating 3,000 dwelling units and 26,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
So, it is not just the opinion of PRIDE, of private citizens, that they are 
creating too many jobs and that that is the source of the vast majority of 
traffic from the project. It is also the opinion of SCAG. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Your group opposes the commercial portion of the Porter Ranch development 
proposal. But the citizens advisory committee voted 13 to 1 in favor of the 
proposal. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A. Councilman Hal Bernson appointed the citizens advisory committee. He said it 
was selected very methodically to represent a cross-section of people, and he 
called this a citizens plan. 
</P>
<P>
But I think you can probably tell from the sentiment at the public hearings 
that the plan is certainly not endorsed 13 to 1 by the public. Quite the 
opposite. Some of our members have met with him privately, and expressed that 
to him, and he simply denies that this is not a representative group. 
</P>
<P>
We have 2,300 petition signatures opposing it and we've talked to thousands of 
people, and we know there is massive, massive public opposition to this type of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Project proponents say the area would be better off with the project than 
without. How do you answer that? 
</P>
<P>
A. Here is an example of that way of thinking: The EIR says that the District 
Plan would allow 83% less commercial development than what has been proposed. 
And the EIR says this reduction in commercial development would severely impact 
the study area street system and potentially clog the larger circulation 
routes, because the street improvements the developer would make, if he were 
allowed to build his project as planned, would not be made. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, somebody is trying very desperately to avoid the truth here. How can 
you have 83% less commercial development and have it make traffic worse. How 
can you say that the only way to get the needed traffic improvement measures is 
to buy this whole project? That is perhaps the fatal flaw in this whole study. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What would happen to the value of your home if Porter Ranch is built as 
planned? 
</P>
<P>
A. I've heard residents say it's going to make property values decline. I've 
also heard people say, "Look at what has happened to property values on the 
Westside as a result of Century City." They've gone up. So, I don't really 
know. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you feel the developer is dealing with the community fairly? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the project is being railroaded. They're going through the motions. 
We've tried very hard to be reasonable and not get too emotional. But it's hard 
not to get the feeling at the hearings we've been through that what we say is 
going in one ear and out the other. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What would your group do if the project is approved in its present form? 
</P>
<P>
A. A lot of the constituency is yelling for a recall of Bernson. We are trying 
not to be impulsive about that. But they feel disenfranchised. We've not 
suggested that. They're yelling at us: 'Why haven't you started a recall?' 
We're still trying to work within the system. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What motivates you to be out front on this issue? 
</P>
<P>
A. Simply that we really love the area and are really trying to preserve some 
of the character of it. Growth and change are inevitable, but we don't think it 
has to be this extreme.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: ALTHOUGH IT WILL NEVER SMELL LIKE A ROSE, HYPERION SEWAGE 
PLANT IS WORKING HARD ON CUTTING DOWN ODORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tim Waters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After 18 years of living on the bluffs above Los Angeles' sprawling Hyperion 
Sewage Treatment Plant, Gerald Bushrow says his nose just isn't what it used to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has been desensitized from Hyperion," the El Segundo resident said. 
"I have people come over and they say, 'What is that smell?' I say, 'What 
smell?' " 
</P>
<P>
It may be too late for Bushrow's nose, but others' could be saved thanks in 
part to a team of eight El Segundo residents who unwittingly put their sniffers 
to work to help determine which foul gases at the plant are the most offensive. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure noses like Bushrow's weren't involved, panel applicants were first 
tested for their ability to smell. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked the most sensitive of the people, those who can smell all the 
smells," said Dick Duffee, president of Odor Science and Engineering, Inc., the 
Connecticut company that put together the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion officials say the idea to enlist the help of a panel is just one of a 
number of efforts undertaken recently to identify and control the foul odors 
that for years have wafted from the plant and into nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
For example, two so-called "odor scrubbing" towers have been installed in the 
plant's primary treatment area, and 13 others will be installed at a cost of 
nearly $11 million as part of the mammoth renovation project now underway. 
Simply put, a scrubber is a large tower where odors are captured in water and 
then treated with chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as the waste water flows into the plant, chemicals -- $5,000 worth a day 
-- are now being added to lessen the bad smells, and some treatment tanks have 
been covered. Cracks in others that provided escape routes for odors have been 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent effort is the "smell-o-rama" conducted for the sensitive 
sniffers on the olfactory panel. The group's members, who were paid for their 
efforts, were recruited through an employment agency. To make sure that they 
remained unbiased, the panelists were not told the gases they would be smelling 
were captured at a sewage plant, said Don Goodroe, Hyperion's superintendent of 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The panelists met periodically from January through April at a local hotel, 
smelling various gases. They identified which of the gases that are detectable 
at the plant smelled the worst. And they tried to determine how much dilution 
of these gases would make them nose-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the panel concluded that Hyperion still has work to do when it 
comes to controlling odors originating at its sludge drying area, Goodroe said, 
adding that they may reconvene the panel for some follow-up testing. 
</P>
<P>
The results from the panel's work, as well as results from other Odor Science 
studies, will be used by Hyperion to cut down on the bad odors. And judging 
from the complaints that the plant receives from its neighbors, the plant still 
has a ways to go, Goodroe conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Still, plant officials say progress is being made. "We feel we can make a 
significant improvement and be as good a neighbor as possible," Goodroe said, 
though he agreed a sewer plant won't ever smell like a rose. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no zero, there is no perfect score," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Some El Segundo residents said they have noticed a decrease in bad odors. Ruth 
Bixler, who has lived near the plant for 20 years, recalls that years ago the 
smell was so strong she would have to close her windows. 
</P>
<P>
And Wesley Joe, who as environmental officer for El Segundo keeps track of the 
odor complaints lodged against Hyperion by residents, said he has not received 
any for two months. 
</P>
<P>
Joe said he did not know whether favorable weather conditions, the work already 
done by Hyperion to control the odors, or a combination of both were 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't hazard to guess," he said. Tim Waters

Two Encinitas men were killed Saturday morning on Interstate 805 when the 
driver lost control of a pickup truck, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, whose names were not released, were driving north on I-805 at Miramar 
Road around 4:15 a.m. The truck drifted into the center divider and the driver 
overcorrected, causing the truck to roll over several times. Both men were 
flung from the vehicle.

PARENT GETS PROBATION FOR SON'S TRUANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old Downey mother, who pleaded guilty to violating the state 
Education Code, is one of the first parents to be prosecuted by the district 
attorney's office in a crackdown on truant children. 
</P>
<P>
Linda M. Parmenter was placed on probation for nine months last week and was 
ordered to attend parenting classes with her 9-year-old son. The son was 
ordered to attend school regularly next school year. 
</P>
<P>
Parmenter was sentenced by Downey Municipal Court Judge Robert G. Drees. 
</P>
<P>
Parmenter was prosecuted under the district attorney's Truancy Mediation 
Program. The program, by Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, was 
initiated in February to enforce the state Education Code provision that 
requires youths ages 6 to 18 to attend school daily. Since February, the 
district attorney's office has reviewed 250 cases in the county and referred 
nine to adult court and 12 to Juvenile Court for code violations. 
</P>
<P>
"When kids are not in school, they are out in the streets," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Leslie Hanke said. She said the program may also prevent crimes by youths who 
are frequently absent from school. 
</P>
<P>
Truancy problems go to the state School Attendance Review Board, where a 
hearing is held. Both the guardian and student are asked to sign an agreement 
to comply with the law. The case is reviewed 45 days later.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 TEEN-AGERS TRAPPED IN TUNNEL FOR 4 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Simi Valley teen-agers were trapped for more than four hours early Saturday 
in a cave at Santa Susana Knolls near Simi Valley after one became stuck while 
crawling through a narrow passage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Feldman, 16, got stuck in a tunnel while following Sara Morris, 15. 
Because Feldman was stuck, Morris was unable to return to the cave's entrance, 
said Sgt. Will Howe of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Two other teen-agers who had been crawling behind Feldman left the cave and 
summoned authorities after trying for more than an hour to help their 6-foot-2, 
160-pound friend squeeze through the passage, Howe said. Firefighters used an 
air chisel to widen the tunnel and free Feldman about 7:30 a.m., more than four 
hours after he became lodged there, Howe said. The teen-agers entered the cave 
during a hike, which began about 10:30 p.m. Friday, Howe said.

NAVY STAGED A WAR, BUT THE 'ENEMY' WAS LEFT SITTING ON THE LAUNCH PAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attack was expected at any minute, but the enemy was having problems getting 
its missiles off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 miles off the Ventura coast, a U.S. Navy battle group of five 
ships waited for the chance to blast the incoming missiles out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
And waited. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had hoped to provide a rare public view of what goes on at the 
Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu as well as a display of Navy 
firepower. 
</P>
<P>
But the plans went awry back at the launch pad. In a sense, it was as if the 
Navy had given a war and nobody came. 
</P>
<P>
The military dramatics began just after dawn Tuesday when the commanding 
officer of the Pacific Missile Test Center, Rear Adm. G. H. Strohsahi Jr., told 
a room of reporters that they soon would be in the middle of the coming action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare Glimpse of War Game 
</P>
<P>
As the press munched on doughnuts, Strohsahi announced that they would be flown 
by helicopter to the Antietam, one of the nation's newest guided missile 
cruisers, for a rare glimpse of a Navy war game. 
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose today is to give you a chance to see the real Navy in action," 
Strohsahi said. "The Antietam is in the middle of a war right now. You're going 
to go out and see four hours of that war." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's readiness exercise had begun the previous Saturday. On this Tuesday, 
the Antietam was preparing to try to knock two incoming missiles out of the air 
before they reached the ship from their launch pad on San Nicolas Island. 
</P>
<P>
But the enemy attack never got off the ground. While the Navy was preparing to 
blast the daylights out of any "enemy" missiles aimed at the Antietam, there 
was an unexplained breakdown at the launch site. 
</P>
<P>
An aging Navy H-46 Sea Knight transport helicopter had already delivered the 
Antietam's visitors to the expected battle site, and the ship's commanding 
officer, Capt. Larry E. Eddingfield, had delivered his welcoming speech when 
the launch problems were first reported. 
</P>
<P>
At first, there was talk of a brief delay. Then there was talk of a long delay. 
Finally, there was a decision to scrub the public missile deal altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"Things break," Eddingfield said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Consolation 
</P>
<P>
One immediate consolation as reporters proceeded with a scheduled tour of the 
Antietam was the rather obvious conclusion to be drawn that it would have been 
a pretty lopsided war in any event. 
</P>
<P>
Heading to the bow of the missile cruiser, Lt. Cmdr. Lanny King, the ship's 
combat systems officer, first pointed out the Antietam's missile launching 
system, capable of firing a mix of 122 Standard, Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles 
with nuclear capability if deemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Then King showed off the rest of the ship, including the sophisticated AN/SPY 
1A radar system that makes the Antietam and other AEGIS missile cruisers the 
most electronically advanced surface battleships in the U.S. fleet, virtual 
floating radar shields for the battleships and aircraft carriers they were 
designed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Antietam's formidable defenses, the Navy had been planning to 
launch two of its antique and unarmed Talos missiles, once part of the nation's 
military arsenal but now useful only as expendable targets for high-tech Navy 
firing practice. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Antietam's officers pointed out that the Talos missiles 
occasionally never got close enough to a cruiser to get shot down anyway, 
sometimes barely making it off the ground before sputtering into a quick form 
of missile suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Pausing on the bridge of the Antietam, King said the momentary launch failure 
was not too upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed, but there will be plenty of chances in the future to test 
ourselves," he said. "This would have been my 86th shot, so I think I can 
afford to miss this one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watched Ship Fire Shells 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of a missile blasting out of the 30-foot mini-silos built into the 
Antietam's deck, reporters were given the chance to watch the ship fire some 
five-inch shells from a front gun position and a demonstration of a modernized 
Gatling gun known as CIWS, for Close In Weapons System, capable of firing 3,000 
rounds a minute at approaching targets. 
</P>
<P>
Then the helicopter returned and it was time for the Antietam's visitors to 
return to shore. Navy spokesmen shrugged off the minor glitch of the day and 
said plans call for more public glimpses of the Navy in action in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Antietam, one of two missile cruisers escorting the battleship 
New Jersey on this particular readiness exercise, continued to prowl the 
coastline, waiting for the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Soon enough, the enemy would figure out how to get its missiles launched. 
</P>
<P>
And the Antietam would be there, waiting.

2-STATE PANEL TO INCLUDE PALMDALE IN STUDY OF HIGH-SPEED TRAIN SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-state commission meeting here Saturday ordered a study of eight 
California locales, including Palmdale, proposed as station sites for a 
futuristic high-speed train linking Las Vegas with the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The $145,000 study will consider ridership potential, and economic and 
environmental effects in each of the nine communities. 
</P>
<P>
When the report is complete -- probably in October -- the 16-member 
California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Committee will select a 
route and station sites for the proposed 200-m.p.h. train. 
</P>
<P>
"This study will allow us to decide how requests for proposals will be drafted 
and whether we want to drop locations from the list," said Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), commission chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The California areas chosen for further study are Barstow, Victor Valley, 
Palmdale, Palm Springs, Ontario, the San Bernardino Valley, western Riverside 
County and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, the study will focus on Las Vegas and Clark County. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the lure of the Magic Kingdom and other tourist attractions, Anaheim 
officials have vigorously supported their city as an ideal terminus for the 
train and had hoped that the commission would decide in their favor at 
Saturday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Campaign 
</P>
<P>
However, San Fernando Valley officials recently have mounted an aggressive 
campaign touting a northern route through Palmdale that would terminate in 
Mission Hills. Most public support at Saturday's meeting was for the northern 
route. 
</P>
<P>
"We would very much favor a route through Palmdale because it would support the 
enormous population that is moving north from Los Angeles" into the Antelope 
Valley, said Palmdale Mayor William Knight. 
</P>
<P>
At an average of more than 250 m.p.h., the high-speed train could whisk 
travelers between Las Vegas and Southern California in 70 minutes, according to 
early feasibility studies. 
</P>
<P>
Those studies also project that as many as 3.6 million passengers would ride 
the train during its first year of operation, at a round-trip fare of $65. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters of the so-called super train believe that the concept will generate 
enough private investment to cover the more than $2.5-billion construction and 
operation costs.

100 YEARS OF JOY IN A TINY SANCTUARY; 
</P>
<P>
36 COUPLES RENEW VOWS AT CHURCH OF THE ANGELS' CENTENNIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Exactly 64 years later, right down to the date and hour, Louise and Charles 
Fishburn repeated their marriage vows and kissed again, just as they had in 
that same place June 11, 1925, at 3 in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
This time there was no price sticker on the sole of a shoe to embarrass the 
bride, as there had been the first time she knelt at the altar of the Church of 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
At that same Pasadena Episcopal church on April 6, 1963, Ralph and Barbara 
Villani's wedding guests forgot to bring rice, so they tossed grits, the 
closest last-minute substitute they could scrounge from the vicar's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Funny, beautiful, tearful and sentimental moments were relived last Sunday at 
the quaint historic 100-year-old church on Pasadena's Avenue 64, where 36 
couples returned to renew their wedding vows. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a celebration of the Church of the Angels' centennial, an 
event that began on Easter and will end on St. Michael and All Angels Day on 
Sept. 24. The church's cornerstone was laid the day before Easter in 1889, and 
the completed building was consecrated just in time to be named for All Angels 
Day that year. 
</P>
<P>
In its first century, 3,000 weddings were recorded in the Church of the Angels' 
registry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built as Memorial 
</P>
<P>
Built as a memorial to landowner Alexander Robert Campbell-Johnston by his 
widow, the tiny church was patterned after the British couple's favorite 
Holmbury St. Mary's Church in Surrey, England. 
</P>

In 1889, the 3,000-acre Johnston-Campbell farmland was in an area known as 
Garvanza, later to be called Highland Park. The church is one of the Episcopal 
Diocese's oldest buildings and has always served an active, albeit small, 
parish. It seats 125 and has about 75 families in its membership. It is a 
registered historic landmark and remains almost exactly as it was when first 
built. 
</P>
<P>
Made of sandstone, red brick and redwood, with a huge stained glass window, 
pipe organ and beautiful handcrafted pulpit, lectern, baptistery and statuary, 
it was a popular wedding site from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"We could easily have three weddings a week, but we try to serve as an 
Episcopal parish church and not a wedding chapel," said the rector, the Rev. 
Robert Gaestel. Newlyweds are required to attend the church and have premarital 
counseling sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Now 
</P>
<P>
There are now only about 12 weddings there in a year, Gaestel said. 
</P>
<P>
History was relived for those who returned Sunday for the special 3 p.m. 
ceremony and champagne-and-cake reception. The church was decorated as if for a 
wedding, with white ribbons marking the pews, each of which seats only five or 
six people. Each "bride" received a miniature bouquet and the men were given 
boutonnieres. 
</P>
<P>
The Fishburns, who lived in Pasadena for many years and now make their home in 
South Laguna, were the longest-married of the guests. They chose the church in 
1925 for its beauty and its small size because, they said, they were new to the 
area and didn't know enough people to fill a large church. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could find my gown," Louise Fishburn said. "I think I must have 
misplaced it about 50 years ago." The newest newlyweds were Tsuzumi and Patrick 
Timothy Day, who married this year on St. Patrick's Day. They said they chose 
the church because he grew up in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflection of the Times 
</P>
<P>
In between there were marriages that reflected America's history. Robert and 
Augusta Sherman of Whittier were married during the Depression in 1934 and 
returned for their 50th anniversary in 1984. "It blessed us, that's why we 
lasted so long," Robert Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Josie Hansen of San Marino and V. N. and Lillian Williams of 
Oceanside were married Nov. 28, 1936, at a double wedding that only their 
families attended because there wasn't room for anyone else. The two women had 
been grade school chums, and both couples returned for Sunday's event. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. and Mrs. T. Burton Smith of Brentwood married there in July, 1943, because, 
they said, during World War II "it was not appropriate to have a big wedding." 
From 1984 to 1986, Smith, a urologist, served as President Reagan's physician 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Laber Case of Pico Rivera, who grew up next door in what was then known as 
the Episcopal Church Home for Children, married Charles Case in the church in 
1954. "I started in the home at age 5, so this was really home to me," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Church Home for Children, a large complex of buildings that shares the 
church site, was for children whose parents couldn't provide homes for them. 
Now called Hillsides, it serves as a sanctuary for abused children. 
</P>
<P>
Brooke and Edward Garlock chose the Church of the Angels for their Aug. 14, 
1976, wedding because of its size. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother wanted All Saints," Brooke Garlock said, referring to the Episcopal 
church that is one of Pasadena's largest. "She only wanted to invite the whole 
city," her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Anniversary 
</P>
<P>
Roger and Lani Leigh, who married in the tiny church on June 11, 1988, 
celebrated their first anniversary in their wedding finery -- he in gray dress 
clothes, she in a long lace-and-pearl gown. She was one of three brides who 
wore their wedding dresses for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief talk during the service, Gaestel said: "From the time the church 
opened to the present there have been tremendous changes in how people think 
about marriages. Not long ago, people didn't want to be married in church at 
all, and women didn't want to be 'given away' from one man to another. Couples 
wanted to be married in a park or on a beach and to write their own vows. Now 
traditional church weddings have come back with a vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Schechter, chairman of the centennial, said no exact records have been kept 
of the couples who married in the church, so it was impossible to track them 
down. Most contact was by word of mouth and publicizing in the church bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, the 36 couples and their families filled the church.

A National Guard helicopter crashed in dense fog early Saturday, killing all 
six crewmen and just missing homes in this Cape Cod tourist haven, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The UH-1 Bell helicopter cut a 20-foot-wide path through the woods before 
crashing, throwing its doors, glass and other debris over a wide area. The 
cockpit was shattered beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Three victims were members of a Delaware Army National Guard unit from New 
Castle, Del. 
</P>
<P>
Delaware Guard spokeswoman Terry Blevins identified them as 1st Lt. David 
Joseph Hendry, 26, and Chief Warrant Officer Hugh Bryan Pearce, 35, both of 
Wilmington, and Staff Sgt. Benjamin Robert Greenplate, 40, of Newark, Del. 
</P>
<P>
Another victim was identified as Sgt. Ward Arthur Cornell, 43, of Mansfield, 
Conn., said Maj. Gen. John T. Gereski, Connecticut's adjutant general. 
</P>
<P>
The other two victims were from a Richmond, Va., unit, the 80th Maneuver 
Training Command, and were identified as Master Sgt. Robert E. Lucey Jr. of 
Emporia, Va., and Spec. Samuel K. May of Richmond, said Virginia Army Reserve 
spokeswoman Maj. Mari K. Eder.

MANILA REBELS' TACTICS TAKE VIOLENT TURN

<TEXT>
<P>
A hastily scrawled sign in the window of a tailor shop across from the gate to 
Camp Crame, headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary, speaks volumes about 
the current state of internal security here. 
</P>
<P>
"Bulletproof vests for sale," the sign says. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-week period last month, insurgents of the Communist New People's 
Army assassinated at least seven police officers and soldiers in and around 
Manila. Only two of the "sparrows," as the urban assassins are known, have been 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in activity by the NPA insurgents is viewed by some as a desperate 
bid by the group to keep its name in the headlines at a time of sinking 
popularity. Others describe the killings as a shift in strategy, from rural 
ambushes to an urban campaign aimed at destabilizing the government of 
President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
The most notorious killing so far this year took place April 21, when Col. 
James N. Rowe, a U.S. Army officer who worked with the Joint U.S. Military 
Assistance Group (JUSMAG) in Quezon City, was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
A statement delivered to news agencies by the NPA the following day described 
Rowe, who had been decorated for service in Vietnam, as a "direct participant 
in the U.S.-designed 'total war' counterinsurgency program of the Aquino 
regime." It promised that attacks on U.S. installations and personnel would 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Rowe's death, JUSMAG is pressing ahead with a plan to relocate 
to a more secure area near the U.S. Embassy in central Manila. The plans was 
adopted after the killing of three U.S. service personnel outside Clark Air 
Base in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Security officials are concerned about the degree of sophistication shown by 
the insurgents in the Rowe killing and warn that efforts to protect American 
officials could be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 killings were random shootings outside the base, but Rowe had 
apparently been carefully observed. His killing was carried out with precision, 
as he was being driven to his office. 
</P>
<P>
The killers had identified a stretch of road that Rowe would have to use to get 
to JUSMAG. They knew that his car was armored. They fired high-velocity bullets 
through the window frame, knowing that he always sat on the left side of the 
rear seat. 
</P>
<P>
The Rowe killing is believed to have been approved by the entire leadership of 
the Communist Party and directed by Romulo Kintanar, the NPA chief, who escaped 
from prison earlier this year. Kintanar is regarded as a hard-line, ruthless 
adversary by security officials. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe's death came after a period in which the NPA strategy of shooting police 
officers and soldiers appears to have backfired, causing resentment of the NPA 
rather than the desired buildup of support. 
</P>
<P>
The insurgency appears to have fallen on hard times in the country at large. 
Diplomats and security experts said that since Aquino replaced Ferdinand E. 
Marcos in 1986, the Communists have lost their biggest rallying point. In 
addition, after years of decline, the Philippine economy is roaring ahead -- 
the gross national product rose 6.7% last year -- and this has undercut the 
Communists' ability to exploit economic resentment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, upheavals in China and the Soviet Union appear to have diminished 
the impact of classical Marxist propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus is that the insurgency problem is gradually diminishing," said 
Francisco Sumulong, majority floor leader in the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the NPA is believed to have about 25,000 active members spread over 
at least three provinces. Rafael Ileto, Aquino's national security adviser, 
said in an interview that NPA strength is thought to have declined by 1,500 in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"With employment increasing, recruitment to the Communists is definitely 
decreasing," Ileto said. "They are irritants but not really threats to national 
security." 
</P>
<P>
Arrayed against the NPA is the Philippine armed forces, composed of 150,000 
troops equipped by the United States with weapons that include helicopters and 
jet fighters. 
</P>
<P>
The government's overwhelming material advantage appears to preclude any 
significant Communist advances at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
Even the man thought to be the head of the Communist Party, Rodolfo Salas, said 
in a recent prison interview that he doubted that the party could make good on 
a forecast made last December that it would take over the government within 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The main goal of the guerrillas, beyond general destabilization, appears to be 
to put enough pressure on the Aquino government to force the closure of 
American military installations. The insurgents even offered to declare a 
unilateral cease-fire if the government would promise to close the bases by 
1991. "The bases are their No. 1 aim," Ileto said. "We will not allow them to 
win on this issue."

Israeli soldiers reportedly shot and killed a 15-year-old Palestinian and 
wounded 15 Arabs in clashes that broke out Saturday during a Palestinian strike 
to protest Israel's Middle East peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, troops reportedly burned uniforms belonging to Arab militants. 
According to an Arab report, the soldiers also torched several copies of the 
Koran, the holy book of Muslims, along with the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Arab reports said the strike was observed in the seaside Gaza Strip, where 
troops on Friday killed three Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
New confrontations were reported Saturday, and officials at Gaza City's Shifa 
Hospital said they treated eight wounded. 
</P>
<P>
In the Khan Yunis refugee camp, soldiers shot Akram Mohammed Schade Saada in 
the neck, and he later died at the nearby Nasser Hospital, hospital officials 
and Israel Radio reported. The military command said it was checking the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The army immediately imposed a curfew on the camp, forcing its 35,000 residents 
to stay indoors, Arab reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Palestinians were wounded in scattered clashes in the West Bank, 
including a 13-year-old boy shot in the leg during an army raid on the village 
of Burin, hospital officials said. The army confirmed one wounded. 
</P>
<P>
During one raid, soldiers uncovered a cache of uniforms belonging to activists 
of the Palestinian Popular Army, an umbrella group of uprising leaders linked 
to the Palestine Liberation Organization. The uniforms were hidden in an 
Islamic shrine, and soldiers burned them together with several copies of the 
Koran, Arab reports said. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 Arabs have been killed since December, 1987, when the uprising 
against Israeli rule of the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank began. Nineteen 
Israelis have died.

STRATEGIC CITY RETAKEN FROM GUERRILLAS, AFGHANISTAN SAYS

Thousands of Afghan soldiers captured a strategic city near Jalalabad and 
killed more than 200 guerrillas in a major offensive involving artillery and 
air support, the government said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our troops are in complete control not only of Jalalabad but also of areas 
beyond the city, and we are pushing the enemy" toward Pakistan, Mohammed Nabi 
Amani, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Amani said the recently completed offensive by 10,000 government troops 
captured the city of Khushgumbad, 20 miles east of Jalalabad. "Our victory is 
very crucial because we have an important airport at Khushgumbad," Amani said. 
</P>
<P>
The city of 30,000 was considered a guerrilla stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
The eastern city of Jalalabad was the guerrillas' first major target after 
Soviet troops completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 from Afghanistan. The rebels 
predicted a quick victory, but a stalemate occurred soon after the battle began 
three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We are no more just defending positions, we are now on the offensive," Amani 
said. "The areas are not only under our control, but we are setting up 
permanent military posts." 
</P>
<P>
Afghan President Najibullah has called upon the United States and Pakistan, 
which support the guerrillas, to press for a negotiated settlement to the war, 
which Najibullah says the guerrillas are incapable of winning. The insurgents 
control much of Afghanistan's countryside but have been unable to take major 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The state-run Bakhtar news agency said 229 guerrillas were killed and 150 
wounded in the offensive. It said 86 rocket launchers and 18,200 machine-gun 
cartridges were captured. The report did not mention government casualties. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately possible to verify the government's claims. 
</P>
<P>
An Asian diplomat who monitors military developments in Afghanistan said such a 
victory would be a major blow to the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
"Jalalabad was the prestige battle, and if the government is now saying it is 
pushing the rebels farther east, it is a big blow to the insurgents," said the 
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

RUSHDIE LABELS REVOLUTION IN IRAN AS A FORCE FOR EVIL

British writer Salman Rushdie, in his first interview since being forced into 
hiding by death threats, has described the Islamic revolution in Iran as a 
force for evil. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the controversial book, "The Satanic Verses," spoke bitterly to a 
British newspaper about the revolution ushered in 10 years ago when the late 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ousted the Shah of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"It ate most of the people that supported it. It ate the unions, it ate the 
women's groups, it ate the socialists and left behind only its own bloated 
members," he said in an interview published today in the Mail. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie has been under police guard since last February, when Khomeini 
denounced the novel as blasphemous and ordered Muslims to kill its author. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, who described himself as a lapsed Muslim, said he felt saddened by the 
ban on his book by many Islamic countries and by the willingness of his critics 
to attack it without having read it. "They're willing to say things about my 
work which are not based on reading. But gradually the book will be read." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie indicated that the threats against his life were exaggerated, but the 
interviewer described him as "paralyzed by terror" when a car crashed noisily 
onto the pavement near a London house where they met.

Housing Secretary Jack Kemp conceded Saturday that being a Ronald Reagan 
supporter has made him less willing to blame his predecessor publicly for years 
of abuse now being uncovered within his department. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the partisan ethics controversies swirling in the nation's capital, Kemp 
turned aside repeated attempts in an interview to get him to fault Samuel R. 
Pierce Jr., head of the Housing and Urban Development Department under 
President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"There were problems, there was mismanagement, there were programs that were 
abused and there was political influence going on a lot longer than just the 
eight (Reagan) years," Kemp said on CNN's "Evans and Novak" program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites 'Systemic Flaw' 
</P>
<P>
"There was a systemic flaw that had to be corrected," he said, using a phrase 
he then emphasized several times. "I am outraged at what I have found at HUD 
but, again, I am going to put the blame as much as possible on those systemic 
problems that were allowed to exist." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed on the question of responsibility at the top, however, the former 
congressman said: "I'm not trying to shift the blame, but I don't want to get 
into name-calling. . . . This is an atmosphere in which some people would like 
to use it in a partisan way, and I'm a Republican, a strong supporter of the 
Reagan Administration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years of Abuse Found 
</P>
<P>
News reports and congressional hearings have begun to uncover years of abuse, 
fraud and embezzlement in HUD programs. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh issued orders last week for investigations at every 
local HUD office in the nation, searching for millions of dollars lost, 
diverted or stolen in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said on the CNN program: "Where there are criminal acts, they will be 
fully prosecuted. Where the system is flawed, I will correct that system. . . .

ASTRONAUT, 49, DIES IN CRASH OF VINTAGE AIRCRAFT

<P>
Astronaut S. David Griggs, who flew on the space shuttle in 1985 and was in 
training to pilot a mission in November, died Saturday when the vintage plane 
he was flying slammed into a field, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Carr, a NASA spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said that 
Griggs was flying a World War II North American T-6, "a vintage trainer 
airplane," and that he apparently was performing aerobatics at the time of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told he was out here practicing this morning and was going to go to an 
air show at Clarksville, Ark.," said Peter Kerwin, an investigator for the 
Federal Aviation Administration who was on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
An astronaut since August, 1979, Griggs, 49, had been undergoing training as 
pilot for shuttle flight No. 33, aboard the Discovery, NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what we do know in our experience with shuttle crew training, we 
don't see anything that would signal that we could not continue to move toward 
that November launch date," Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran pilot had more than 9,000 hours of flying time, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occurred Near Memphis 
</P>
<P>
Lamar Coleman, a dispatcher for the Crittenden County Sheriff's Department, 
said that the crash occurred south of Earle, about 20 miles west of Memphis, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said Griggs, of Portland, Ore., was flying for McNeely Charter Service, 
a private air service based in Earle. 
</P>
<P>
Carr said a replacement for Griggs would have to be named within the next week 
or so, adding that it should not be a problem to draw from the pool of 
available astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're five months out from flight," Carr said. "Training doesn't really begin 
until about this time." Three other flights, in July, September and October, 
are scheduled before the November launching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No NASA Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether NASA placed any restrictions on what astronauts could do in 
their own time, including risky activities, Carr replied: 
</P>
<P>
"You can't lock these guys in their houses. These guys have thousands of hours 
of flying experience. They take a greater risk driving down the Gulf Freeway in 
Houston than by flying. There are no restrictions on piloting." 
</P>
<P>
Griggs flew as a mission specialist on a shuttle mission in April, 1985, that 
included Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah). 
</P>
<P>
He was appointed chief of the Shuttle Training Aircraft Operations Office in 
January, 1976. His responsibility included operational use of the shuttle 
trainer.

SCHOOL YEARBOOK VOTED LEAST LIKELY TO SUCCEED

Palm Springs High School officials have sent the school's yearbook back to the 
printer after finding copies filled with ethnic slurs and rude remarks about 
female cheerleaders and gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents who have personally contacted me have said that the students would 
have been devastated had the document gone out in its original form," Palm 
Springs Unified School District Supt. Wilber Hawkins said Friday. "They were 
pleased that it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Among the offensive pages being replaced was one with a picture of a 
Mexican-American club and a caption implying that the members were illegal 
aliens, Hawkins said. Other pages in the book, which is named "The Chia," had 
references to drug and alcohol use and sexual intercourse, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Cost: $11,000 
</P>
<P>
The revisions will cost the student body an extra $11,000 and the yearbook will 
not be ready for another six to eight weeks. Seniors who had been looking 
forward to collecting friends' autographs in their yearbooks on Friday's final 
day of school had to settle for a supplement to the yearbook that carried 
photos from recent events, Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district would not take any action against faculty yearbook adviser 
John McKee or the students who produced the yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's an internal matter. That's up to the administration of the 
school," Hawkins said. "There were several people who should have seen to it 
that the yearbook was unpublishable in its original form." 
</P>
<P>
Several messages seeking comment from Principal Darryl Stucker's office were 
not immediately returned, his secretary said, because the principal was busy 
with last-day-of-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promises Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Stucker, who had earlier confiscated the yearbook staff's computer disks, has 
promised an investigation. "We are going to look into our editing process and 
find out what led to this," he said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
However, yearbook staff member Tod Goldberg defended the book. 
</P>
<P>
"They are worried about what parents or administrators might find offensive but 
the book isn't written for them, but for the students," Goldberg said.

FUEL OIL SPILL FORCES BRIEF CLOSURE OF BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A diesel fuel spill apparently caused by last week's sinking of a tugboat in 
Long Beach forced the brief closing of a small area of beach Saturday in 
Newport Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel washed ashore between 17th and 19th streets, and the area was closed 
for 30 to 40 minutes Saturday morning, said Marine Safety Lt. John Bauer. By 
afternoon, the sun had evaporated the fuel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel spill occurred Wednesday when a Navy attack submarine accidently 
snagged the tugboat's towline and dragged the vessel under. One of three men 
aboard the tugboat is missing and presumed dead.

BRADLEY INQUIRIES THRUST LOW-PROFILE CITY TREASURER INTO THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg settled into a witness chair in the 
City Council chambers last month for what was to be a historic hearing into the 
city's investigation of Mayor Tom Bradley for possible conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
As Rittenberg made himself comfortable next to City Atty. James K. Hahn, City 
Council President John Ferraro leaned to an aide. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's that guy next to Hahn?" Ferraro whispered. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been the last day that any member of the City Council would have 
trouble recognizing Rittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figure in Bradley Queries 
</P>
<P>
The city treasurer has emerged as a central figure in the investigations into 
the mayor's relationship with Far East National Bank, which paid Bradley to act 
as its adviser at the same time it was receiving city deposits. 
</P>
<P>
And Rittenberg's office, which has responsibility for all $2 billion of the 
city's idle cash, has become the focus of concern for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Councilwoman Gloria Molina asked the council to order a 
management audit of Rittenberg's policies. While her effort lost on a vote, 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said his Finance and Revenue Committee will report 
to the council as early as July on the treasurer's investment policies. 
</P>
<P>
One of the actions prompting the ongoing Bradley probe was a telephone call 
made by the mayor to Rittenberg in March, in which Bradley inquired about city 
deposits at Far East. After the call, Rittenberg had his aides deposit $2 
million in city funds at the bank. The treasurer said later that Bradley had 
not pressured him to deposit the money. 
</P>
<P>
In another instance that has drawn the council's attention, Rittenberg's staff 
allowed $1.2 million to sit in an account at Far East National Bank, earning no 
interest, for several months. Rittenberg took the blame for the error. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials who have dealt with the 21-year veteran of the city 
treasurer's office say that such mistakes are not characteristic of his career. 
According to them, Rittenberg is a strong manager adept at computer 
technologies and the rapidly changing financial markets with which his office 
must deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reputation as Activist 
</P>
<P>
And, in an otherwise staid and colorless office, he has earned a reputation as 
an activist. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg's low profile among the council members was credited to his 
performance over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the treasurer's office has been a relatively invisible office," said 
Yaroslavsky, who as chairman of the Finance and Revenue Committee knows 
Rittenberg better than most on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Invisible primarily because it has not gotten the city in any trouble. Around 
here, when you know somebody's name, it's not because they did an outstanding 
job. It's because they screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg, 57, was appointed treasurer by Bradley and quickly confirmed by the 
council in 1987. He had joined the office in 1968 as an accountant after an 
eclectic academic career that included majors in chemical engineering, 
mathematics and business administration. He eventually earned a degree in 
accounting from UCLA, served in the military and graduated from the San 
Fernando College of Law. 
</P>
<P>
He steadily rose in the treasurer's office to become chief deputy in 1981, and 
when then-Treasurer Robert Odell became ill in 1986, Rittenberg was named 
acting treasurer. Odell died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In selecting a successor for the $83,415-a-year job, Bradley picked the No. 1 
finalist from a list of 12 drawn up by the city's Personnel Department. 
</P>
<P>
While Rittenberg was still acting treasurer, he and Yaroslavsky traveled to New 
York together on city business. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a doer," Yaroslavsky said. "He wanted to be more of an activist than 
Odell had been. . . . Rittenberg was more aggressive, more impatient, more 
wanting to get things done more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
It may have been a penchant for activism that has landed Rittenberg in hot 
water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minority-Owned Banks 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the City Council's concern is a policy developed independently 
by Rittenberg that allows millions of dollars of city funds to be invested in 
minority-owned banks at rates that may not be the highest available. Rittenberg 
says the policy, which has been supported by the mayor's office, is an 
extension of the city's existing programs to encourage minority business. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining himself in a May interview, Rittenberg said: "The city and myself as 
city treasurer have a responsibility and commitment to assist those banks that 
contribute to the community. By placing deposits with (minority) banks, I have 
an expectation that this money will increase the amount for new loans in the 
community. It has been my position to become extremely pro-active in this 
pursuit. . . . I have a social conscience, and I feel this must be done." 
</P>
<P>
Since that interview, Rittenberg has refused to speak with the press and his 
staff has been instructed not to give any interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's somewhat unusual structure, the treasurer receives funds from 
taxpayers and other sources and deposits or invests the monies. Only the city 
controller can disburse funds. When the controller needs money to pay the 
city's bills, he asks the treasurer to release some of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Just three city workers, sitting at gray metal desks in the bowels of City 
Hall, handle the task of placing the city's $2-billion cash flow. More than $1 
billion comes and goes in the course of a month, and hundreds of deposits are 
received each day. Rittenberg, while not personally investing all of the city's 
funds, oversees all the department's work. 
</P>
<P>
Treasurers for other cities have said Rittenberg's minority-investment policies 
are unusual, and they may not comply with the City Charter, which calls on the 
treasurer to seek the highest rates possible. In recent annual audits, the city 
controller's office has identified what it considered "weakness" in internal 
controls -- many of which have since been strengthened -- but otherwise gave 
the treasurer's office a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return on Investments 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg typically places in the top half to one-third of California's big 
city treasurers in his return on investment, according to some studies. And 
that has meant good money for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, for example, when city officials prepared the annual budget, 
their revenue projections were several million dollars higher than those made 
by independent economists. The city's figures were higher, it turned out, 
because Rittenberg had timed the markets correctly and had placed most of the 
city's funds in long-term, high-yielding accounts just as interest rates peaked 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
According to city workers, Rittenberg is considered shy, serious and an 
approachable administrator. But the criticism and publicity of recent months 
have taken a toll, according to Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's going through hell now," Yaroslavsky said. "When you come to work 
for the city of Los Angeles as treasurer . . . you never expected to be reading 
about yourself on the front page of the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, while publicly saying he is "very concerned" about Rittenberg's 
policies, said he has counseled the treasurer to "relax a little bit and focus 
on the future. What has happened has happened. . . . The sun will rise 
tomorrow, and he will still be the treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps taking that advice, Rittenberg wrote a letter to key City Council 
members late last month. 
</P>
<P>
"The highly publicized events of the past two months have resulted in 
considerable misconception and distortion of the city treasurer's operations," 
he wrote. "As department head, I am responsible for the errors made by my staff 
and, similarly, I am also responsible for the achievements made by my staff. 
During my three years as acting treasurer and treasurer, this office has 
generated nearly $30 million of additional revenue. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I am proud of the city treasury's accomplishments."

NEW GENERATION TRACES JUSTICE TRAIL 
</P>

More than 20 years ago, Jessie Kupers' father was in the thick of the struggle 
for civil rights in the South as a UCLA medical student looking into health 
problems of poor blacks. Saturday, Jessie, 13, boarded a freedom bus bound for 
Mississippi with a similar mission in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to go because racism is still present, and I want people to know 
that there are people who care," said Jessie, a student of the 32nd Street 
Performing Arts Magnet. 
</P>
<P>
A generation gap was apparent outside the Watts Towers as a contingent of young 
people departed for Philadelphia, Miss., for a special commemoration of the 
brutal slaying of three civil rights workers a quarter century ago. For the 
older generation who came to say their goodbys, Andrew Goodman, James Chaney 
and Henry Schwerner were household names in the turbulent 1960s. For most of 
those who left on the Greyhound, the three were virtually unknown until last 
year's Academy Award-winning movie, "Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
Generation gap aside, there was a common bond: they agree that the work the 
three civil rights workers helped pioneer is far from finished. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights "caravan" left Watts with 43 people -- mostly college students 
-- who will trace the historic route of the civil rights struggle in the South. 
They will stop at Little Rock, Ark., Selma and Montgomery, Ala., and go on to 
Philadelphia, Miss., before joining hundreds of other freedom riders from 
around the country in Washington to participate in memorial services and 
congressional meetings. The caravan will make its final stop in New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Training of Field Workers 
</P>
<P>
The commemoration is organized by the Chaney, Goodman, Schwerner Memorial 
Coalition and Human SERVE, a national voting rights organization. The group is 
using the event to train field workers and highlight its campaign for automatic 
voter registration and other electoral reform. 
</P>
<P>
Chaney, a black Meridian, Miss., resident, and Goodman and Schwerner, two white 
New Yorkers, were conducting a voter registration drive when they were arrested 
on a traffic violation and taken to jail in Philadelphia. After their release 
on June 21, 1964, a gang of police and Ku Klux Klansmen kidnaped them. Their 
bodies were found 44 days later, buried in an earthen dam. Murder charges were 
dropped in state court but a federal court later convicted seven men for 
violating civil rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Chaney, president of the James Earl Chaney Foundation, named after his 
slain brother, came from Meridian to send off the Los Angeles contingent. "We 
have to educate the young, rededicate the old, and rekindle the spirit of the 
movement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief address to the "freedom riders," Chaney noted that he was arrested 
21 times for civil rights causes before he was 12 years old. The participation 
by the Los Angeles young people, he said, is a "statement of courage." 
</P>
<P>
Said Chaney: "We've moved ahead, but even though poll taxes and literacy tests 
are things of the past, illiteracy and economic injustice are still in our way. 
We can start to progress only through increased participation and easier voter 
registration." 
</P>
<P>
The question of economic justice was on the minds of several of the freedom 
riders. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Sullivan, 18, a freshman drama student at UC Irvine, said she is making 
the trip to contribute to the fight against racism. "All of my life I have seen 
racism and economic oppression," she said. "Why is it when I drive past on Skid 
Row I see that most of the homeless people are black? The black community needs 
to be empowered, and increased voter registration is the first step toward 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's friend, Manami Kano, a 17-year-old Japanese-American, said the 
freedom ride was "not an ordinary outing" for her. "Racism hits me," she said. 
"The status quo shows so little tolerance for other races." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Kupers, 48, Jessie's mother, told her friends how Jessie had raised more 
than $200 to pay for his trip and talked his teachers into allowing him to take 
his exams early. As Jessie was about to board the bus, his mother, a marriage 
and family therapist, embraced him and reminded him that he had promised to 
phone her every day. 
</P>
<P>
The departure was delayed for a few minutes to accommodate the arrival of three 
black South Africans who are making the trip. Charmaine Motjadji, 38, a 
graduate student in film at UCLA, said she had encouraged her 20-year-old son, 
Ouda, and two other black South Africans who attend Santa Monica College to 
make the trip "to see the historical aspect of the struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Said Motjadji: "The American people always support our struggle . . . we want 
to support theirs. Their struggle is our struggle, too. We are fighting for the 
vote; they have the vote but they don't use it."

RIGHTS OFFICIAL WON'T TESTIFY IN BIAS LAWSUIT

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Civil Rights Commission Chairman William Allen has withdrawn plans to 
testify for the defense in a discrimination lawsuit filed on behalf of Latino 
voters against Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's decision to drop plans to appear as a paid county witness came Friday 
after a commission attorney said he considered the proposed testimony a 
violation of the panel's ethics policy. Other commission members voted not to 
alter the conflict-of-interest regulations to permit Allen to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (the county) at the outset I would not do it (if the conflict code was 
upheld)," Allen said. "So I will not do the work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Taking Sides, He Says 
</P>
<P>
Allen insisted that he was not taking sides in the discrimination case, saying 
that his testimony would have involved the same kind of expert information on 
voting patterns that he routinely provides as a political science professor at 
Harvey Mudd College in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department, American Civil Liberties Union and Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund in separate lawsuits have accused 
the county of gerrymandering the boundaries of supervisorial districts to 
dilute the voting power of the county's sizable Hispanic population.

AMID TERROR AND DESPAIR, A TEEN-AGER MEASURES HIS FATHER'S WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Father's Day passes as just another day of the year for most of us, but no 
longer for me. It may not have Christmas presents or Thanksgiving turkey or 
birthday cake and ice cream, but it celebrates one thing we too easily take for 
granted -- a living father. 
</P>
<P>
Like most teen-agers whose lives are untouched by death, I had always thought 
of my father as invincible -- immortal. But one night four years ago, all that 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
As I lay in my bed, on the verge of sleep, I saw my dad pass my room. I assumed 
he was going to grab a midnight snack. Then, I heard the familiar low hum of 
the breathing machine, which aids asthmatics like my father in breathing. At 
first, I was not concerned because he uses the breathing machine two or three 
times a week and this usually stops the asthma he has suffered from since he 
was 2. 
</P>
<P>
Then I heard him cry out. "Help!" he said in a voice choked with fear. I felt 
my heart race. I heard my dad call again, this time more desperately. Quickly, 
I jumped up and ran into the living room, where I saw my dad on one knee, his 
back hunched over, the breathing machine sticking out of his mouth. Then I 
noticed his face. It was ghostly white. 
</P>
<P>
I have asthma myself and have experienced some attacks, but never like this. 
First, breathing is accompanied by a high-pitched whistling sound, and then, 
suddenly, the lungs shut and breathing is barely possible. Each breath is a 
major struggle and it feels as though death is certain. And sometimes -- in 
extreme cases -- it is. 
</P>
<P>
I could see that my dad's attack was an extreme case. And that he was in the 
biggest battle of his life. While my mom was on the phone, I watched my dad 
drop the breathing machine and fall to the floor unconscious. I tried to wake 
him up, but he did not respond. My mom rushed to him, put her arms around him 
and showered him with kisses. I could see her shaking, and my heart sank. I was 
only 15 at the time, but suddenly I felt helpless, numb and old beyond my 
years. My two brothers, who were then 13 and 17, entered the room. When they 
saw my dad lying unconscious, a look of terror crossed their faces. 
</P>
<P>
The paramedics arrived five minutes later, but it seemed like five hours. 
Several men rushed through the door, and one began pushing my dad's stomach. 
Another started an IV. 
</P>
<P>
As they were attending to my dad, one man said, "He's going down." My mom, my 
two brothers and I thought they meant that my dad was dying. I ran into the 
bathroom, slammed the door and pounded my fists into the mirror. I felt like I 
had been an ungrateful son and that I had not done enough for him. Just the day 
before, I had gotten into an argument with him, and I had gone to bed without 
ever smoothing things over. Now he was going to die and the last thing he would 
remember about me was that I was a bratty and defiant son. These thoughts, as 
well as feelings of love toward my dad and worries of how difficult life 
without him would be, raced through my head. 
</P>
<P>
I returned to the living room, and, with relief, heard a paramedic explain that 
when he said my dad was "going down," he meant going down to the hospital. I 
was relieved, but the emptiness would not subside. 
</P>
<P>
It was only later that night, in the hospital, when a doctor told us my dad 
would be fine, that I began to feel human again. Before, when I thought he was 
going to die, all I could think about was how great my dad was, how much he had 
done for me and how little I had done for him. Since that day four years ago, 
my attitude toward my dad has changed. Now, not only on Father's Day but every 
day, I appreciate the love he has given me, and I cherish every moment we have 
together. I also give back to him all the love I can. Before his brush with 
death, I had not done enough to let him know how much I loved him. He now 
knows. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as a young man, whenever I have difficulty expressing that love, I think 
back to the time I saw my dad lying in the hospital, semi-conscious and hooked 
up to tubes. The doctor said the medicine he was taking had made him delirious. 
As we were about to leave, I heard my dad say, "Scotty, I always loved you, 
Scotty." Even though the doctor said my dad did not know what he was saying, I 
knew that he did. I burst into tears and said: "I love you too, daddy."

<TEXT>
<P>
Stopper: Bob Welch, with a pulled groin muscle, became the ninth player put on 
the disabled list by the Oakland Athletics this year, but the A's roll on. They 
have lost two in a row four times but not three in a row since Aug. 18-19-20. 
Dave Stewart is a key factor. He is 6-0 in starts that follow losses. 
</P>
<P>
Big Daddy: The San Franciso Giants' Rick Reuschel is 11-2 and 8-0 since April 
28. The last time he won 20 was 1977 with the Chicago Cubs. If he does it again 
it will be the longest span between 20-win seasons in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
Finishers: The impact of relief pitching is such that most starters now believe 
they have done their job if they get their team into the sixth or seventh 
innings with a chance to win. Consider that Reuschel, Danny Jackson, Dwight 
Gooden, Eric Show, Zane Smith and Floyd Youmans had combined for 80 starts 
through Thursday and did not have one complete game. 
</P>
<P>
Sky High: Concession prices at the Toronto SkyDome include $6.50 for a jumbo 
dog and $3.50 for a draft beer. Said outfielder Pat Sheridan, recently traded 
from Detroit to San Francisco: "Well, you can ask your kids, 'Do you want to go 
to Europe or the SkyDome?' " 
</P>
<P>
Heat: It is generally conceded that Cincinnati relief pitcher Ron Dibble throws 
consistently harder than anyone in either league. Dibble is registering half 
his outs on strikeouts. He has pitched 43 innings, which equates to 129 outs, 
and he has 65 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Heat II: Nolan Ryan's 115 strikeouts are his most through 13 starts since 1977, 
when he was 30 and pitching for the Angels. Now 42, the only evidence of age is 
his obvious effectiveness with more rest. The Texas Rangers' right-hander is 
3-2 with a 4.81 ERA and has struck out 10 or more batters only once when 
working on four days' rest. He is 5-1 with a 2.18 ERA and has struck out 10 or 
more batters six times when working with more than four days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
Wally World: Angel first baseman Wally Joyner began the weekend series in 
Detroit having hit .403 since May 19, but the lack of run production by a No. 3 
hitter has debilitated the offense. Joyner had driven in only nine runs during 
the 72 at-bats of his hot streak and 19 for the season. He had hit only one 
home run in 305 at-bats dating to Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Dichotomy: The Boston Red Sox are 7-10 in games decided by one run: 7-0 in 
Fenway Park and 0-10 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Mismatch: The Montreal Expos' Kevin Gross has a 3-14 record against the St. 
Cardinals, having permitted 70 earned runs in 115 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Doormats: The San Diego Padres' Bruce Hurst was 3-0 with a 1.75 ERA against the 
Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies through Thursday but 2-5 with a 4.41 
ERA against more formidable competition. ROSS NEWHAN

CONSUMER REPORT: FCC ACTS TO CURB TELEPHONE ABUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER, Adler is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chances of getting a hotel telephone bill with charges from a company 
you've never heard of have diminished, thanks to new rules imposed by the 
Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative operator service companies offer leased lines from other companies, 
then make separate contracts with hotels for operator service. 
</P>
<P>
This type of company, also called a "reseller," has grown substantially since 
the FCC's 1984 decision to allow long-distance phone competition in the 
pay-telephone industry. 
</P>
<P>
The root of the problem, some believe, is that AOS companies market their 
services to owners of hotel and airport phones, rather than to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Problems arose, however, when consumers complained about these companies 
charging excessive rates. In addition, the consumers were not aware that they 
were dealing with an alternate service. The FCC estimated that some of these 
firms were charging as much as 10 times more than what AT&amp;T would levy for 
the same call. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Two other consumer complaints concerned "blocking," a practice that stopped the 
caller from reaching a different phone company, and that callers were being 
charged for calls that only received a busy signal. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC then decided that some provision should be made for notifying 
consumers. Although the FCC asked resellers to turn over billing and 
operational procedures, the federal agency said it doesn't regulate such firms 
on the same basis as AT&amp;T and other major phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
As "non-dominant" companies in the industry, the AOS firms don't have to file 
rates or get FCC authority to operate, the FCC said. 
</P>
<P>
However, under the FCC's new guidelines, alternate operator service companies 
have to place notices near telephones stipulating that they are the 
long-distance company at that location. Companies also must provide a customer 
service/information number that consumers can use to find out what the 
company's charges are. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the AOS firm has to identify itself before processing a call. "This is 
called 'branding,' " said Howard Wilchins, acting chief of the FCC's 
enforcement division. "The company must give its name before your call goes 
through. Some people might not notice a sticker or tent card." 
</P>
<P>
Blocking access to a long-distance company of your choice was declared illegal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rates Still High 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, say that these new guidelines do little to change excessive 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The root of the problem, some observers believe, is that AOS companies market 
their services to the owners of phones at hotels and airports, rather than to 
the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Specific rates charged for room-made long-distance calls, for example, can be a 
matter of negotiation between the property and the AOS firm. 
</P>
<P>
According to one estimate, about 15% of U.S. hotels and motels with 100 or more 
rooms use AOS firms. 
</P>
<P>
"Rates charged by the alternative operator services have gone down in the last 
year and a half," Wilchins said. But such rates may still be higher than 
AT&amp;T, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the issue, and how the FCC has handled it, has led to a bill -- 
the Telephone Operator Service Consumer Protection Act of 1989 -- which has 
been introduced in the House of Representatives. The bill would give more 
authority to the FCC over AOS companies. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, AOS firms would have to provide rate information to the FCC. If the 
FCC would find these rates unreasonable, it could require the AOS company to 
demonstrate that its charges are justified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
The bill also seeks to make AOS firms identify themselves to the consumer 
before the caller incurs any charges. Firms also must post notices that give 
the name, address and toll-free number of their company. 
</P>
<P>
AOS providers also would have to tell the consumer, upon request, what its rate 
will be for the call, as well as company billing methods and complaint 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
To combat complaints, the resellers created their own trade association, the 
Operator Service Providers of America. It has 40 members. 
</P>
<P>
"While we don't want to be under regulation by the government, we do welcome 
the FCC and Congress looking more deeply into what is a new industry that only 
really began in 1985," said OSPA President Paul Gamberg. 
</P>
<P>
For consumers to win any points, they must ask for the pertinent information. 
</P>
<P>
They should listen for the name of the phone company when they lift the 
receiver to make a call. If they don't hear or recognize the company's name, 
they should ask for this identification and what the rates will be. 
</P>
<P>
Time and inclination permitting, consumers always can call AT&amp;T or another 
phone company to find out what rates will be and then can compare them with 
AOS. If another company is preferred, consumers may ask the AOS operator to 
switch the call. 
</P>
<P>
"The gougers are mostly gone, and there aren't any more horror stories," 
Gamberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says the Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center in Washington, 
D.C.. "Rates have come down for some companies but not others," said David 
Wagenhauser, staff attorney for the nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The rates are still extremely high, and they can be camouflaged. For example, 
the AOS operators may allow hotels to add a $1 surcharge to calls on top of the 
rate, with this amount not separately listed when you get your phone bill." 
</P>
<P>
TRAC is offering a one-page sheet with comparison rates between key AOS 
operators and other phone companies for various calling cards, and 
station-to-station and person-to-person calls. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter also contains background information on AOS operations, along 
with instructions on how to file a complaint and seek a refund. To get a copy, 
send $3 to TRAC, Box 12038, Washington, D.C. 20005. 
</P>
<P>
Any complaints about the system should be sent to the Federal Communications 
Commission, Informal Complaints Branch, Common Carrier Bureau, 2025 M St. N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20554. 
</P>
<P>
OSPA is at 15718 Stagg St., Van Nuys 91406, (818) 786-6772, until the end of 
July, when it moves to 1776 K St. N.W., Suite 900, Washington, D.C. 20006,

'SHALOM, Y'ALL': WELCOME TO ISRAELI DUDE RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Barbara.

<DATELINE>
<P>
TIBERIAS, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We had climbed Masada, floated in the Dead Sea, prayed at the Wailing Wall, 
traced the steps of Jesus and touched Mohammed's rock. 
</P>
<P>
We had "done" Israel, like millions of other tourists before us, and we were 
exhausted. We had a few days left on our family vacation and wanted to do 
something different and restful. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be another museum or ancient ruin," our teen-ager said. We agreed. 
</P>
<P>
We consulted an Israeli friend who is a travel agent. "I have just the thing 
for you," she said, "a dude ranch in the Galilee." 
</P>
<P>
The children's ears perked up. "Do they have horseback riding?" 
</P>
<P>
"The best in Israel, and they serve American food," she said. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I looked at each other. Did we really come 7,000 miles to go 
horseback riding in Israel? Why not, the children argued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
North to Nazareth 
</P>
<P>
We were on our way. From Jerusalem we traveled north through Nazareth to the 
Sea of Galilee. About 15 miles north of Tiberias, 40 miles from the Lebanon 
border, we found Vered Hagalil. 
</P>
<P>
"Shalom, Y'All" read the sign above the reception desk in the rustic main lodge 
that looks as if it was transplanted from Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Vered Hagalil, which means Rose of Galilee, was built by American-born Yehuda 
Avni, who came here from Chicago in the late 1940s, married an Israeli woman 
and decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Yonah, runs the reception desk and restaurant. Yehuda oversees the 
stables and the grounds. From the moment a guest arrives, both seem to be 
everywhere, ready to help in any way they can. It seems comfortable to call 
them by their first names after only being there a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
The accommodations at the ranch are comfortable and reasonable. Four of us 
stayed in one of the roomy wood and stone cottages for about $85 U.S., which 
included an American-style breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a bunk house that sleeps 12. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Retreat 
</P>
<P>
Because it is a popular retreat for urban Israelis and there are only a dozen 
or so cottages, the ranch is often booked weeks in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Yehuda and Yonah added a pool a few years ago, and may soon have a tennis 
court. But the main attractions are horseback riding and eating. 
</P>
<P>
Because no one in our family had much experience with horses, we did more 
eating than riding. The restaurant specializes in American food, something we 
were all hungry for after two weeks in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
There are no falafel. The fare includes steak, fried chicken served in a basket 
with fries, fresh trout and delicious lemon meringue pie. 
</P>
<P>
For breakfast they serve the best pancakes in Israel. The restaurant is open to 
the public and is usually filled with Israelis who have dropped in to eat 
"American." 
</P>
<P>
In order to work off some of our added pounds, we tried the horseback riding. 
Yehuda was very patient with us tenderfoots, calming our nerves and finding 
just the right horse for us. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you say 'Whoa' in Hebrew?" I asked. Yehuda explained that all the 
beautiful Arabians were bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
Yehuda will tailor a ride to fit a need, from one hour to a week. Prices are 
$12 an hour, $35 half day and $55 for a day. There is a special six-day riding 
package for $100 a day, including room and board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy Ride 
</P>
<P>
We took one of the easy rides through nearby hills overlooking the Sea of 
Galilee. Our guide was a young Israeli, David, who, except that he spoke 
Hebrew, acted and dressed like a Western wrangler. 
</P>
<P>
Longer rides are to the rich, green Hula Valley, down to the River Jordan, up 
to the Golan Heights or to the site where Jesus is said to have given the 
Sermon on the Mount. 
</P>
<P>
The only drawback to our stay at Vered Hagalil was that Yehuda does not allow 
children under 13 to ride on the trails. He does, however, provide a large 
corral that the children can ride in for an hour or so. Lessons also are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
When it was time to leave, we agreed that we would come back someday, eat less 
and take the ride Yehuda describes in the ranch brochure. 
</P>
<P>
"When a tiny black spot in the distance becomes a Bedouin tent where you're 
welcomed to dismount and have coffee; when you ride through the vineyards 
overlooking the sky-blue Sea of Galilee and you suddenly understand why the 
Sermon on the Mount was given here . . . well, then you know you're visiting 
the Galilee as it should be visited . . . on horseback." 
</P>
<P>

Korozin, Israel 12385.

DISCOVERING PORCELAIN OF MEDIEVAL MEISSEN

MEISSEN, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Germans East or West and porcelain lovers the world over, Meissen china is 
incomparable. 
</P>
<P>
Meissen is a pretty medieval town of narrow lanes, quiet corners and 
courtyards. It lies deep in East Germany, tucked between the sunny vineyards of 
the Elbe River about 25 miles northwest of Dresden. 
</P>
<P>
The gray, ponderous building in the heart of the city may look stodgy, but 
inside it's a different story. 
</P>
<P>
The Meissen Porcelain Museum is a palace of shiny parquet floors; crystal 
chandeliers; ceiling frescoes; arched windows and doorways; intricate moldings; 
wide, graceful staircases, and marble columns trimmed in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Bright, airy and elegant, this is the perfect setting for precious porcelain: 
dazzling goblets, figurines, clocks, chess sets, tiles, urns, animal 
sculptures, chandeliers, wall hangings and lots of cups, saucers and plates. 
</P>
<P>
Masterfully crafted, some appear as delicate as wildflowers softly hued in the 
colors of spring meadows. Others -- big, bold and brilliant white -- flaunt the 
beauty of a queen wrapped in ermine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Infinite Styles 
</P>
<P>
Styles are baroque, rococo, classical and abstract, color variations are 
infinite and designs are in the thousands. Add picturesque ornamentation. Make 
it the world's hardest china and you begin to grasp the fascination this 
porcelain holds for its admirers. 
</P>
<P>
Meissen porcelain is said to be tough, but drop it and it still shatters. 
Astonishingly, many priceless museum pieces are not locked behind protective 
glass, such as you would see in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Enormous vases and sculptures -- like a peacock, court jester or giant vulture 
-- stand nonchalantly in the open, perched on wooden blocks. 
</P>
<P>
As I leaned over a huge vase delicately painted with a profusion of butterflies 
and flowers, I expected to hear the all-too-familiar verboten (forbidden) from 
a nearby museum guard. 
</P>
<P>
But not one verboten, not a single "do not touch." 
</P>
<P>
Hordes of porcelain lovers move freely throughout the museum close enough to 
brush the irreplaceable china. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered tables are beautifully draped and elegantly set. If there were 
chairs, it would be hard to resist sitting down for coffee and kuchen, or 
better, a 10-course banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one table setting is roped off. It showcases a stunning, snow-white 
2,000-piece china set created by the great 18th-Century master, Johann Joachim 
Kaendler. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do you breathe in this precious porcelain, but artisans create East 
Germany's coveted export right before your eyes. On the ground floor are five 
demonstration halls. Tours are in German. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't speak the language, the guide offers a drawer jammed with tape 
recordings in Japanese, Hungarian, Arabic, Turkish, Korean, French, Russian, 
Chinese, Finnish and English. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starts With Basics 
</P>
<P>
The first hall demonstrates the basics: a brief history of porcelain and a 
simple explanation of the materials and processes involved. 
</P>
<P>
In the other halls, artisans demonstrate their amazing skills. Each piece is 
made by hand -- from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
As you watch, the recording will explain what each artisan is doing and why. 
One molds vases and plates on a potter's wheel. The next deftly attaches 
flowers, leaves, hats or boots to a figurine. 
</P>
<P>
Another paints Meissen's most famous design -- the cobalt-blue onion pattern -- 
as another creates multicolored flowers. Meissen makes 180 basic colors in 
formulas as secret today as when they were first developed. 
</P>
<P>
This most famous china came to be through greed. In the early 1700s, hundreds 
of alchemists vied to discover a formula for transforming base metals into 
gold. One such alchemist was Johann Friedrich Boettger, a Berlin pharmacist of 
old Prussia. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the King of Prussia got wind of Boettger's talent, the young man fled 
to Saxony. The Prussian king asked the Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, 
Augustus the Strong, to extradite Boettger. Augustus refused. Always short of 
cash, he prayed the alchemist might make gold for him. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Saxon Court was spending large sums importing Chinese and 
Japanese porcelain -- in those days, an ultimate display of wealth and 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
When the alchemist failed to create gold, a prominent physicist convinced 
Augustus that what Boettger really should do was uncover the secret of fine 
porcelain. 
</P>
<P>
In 1709 Boettger proudly announced: "I've made white gold!" To guard this 
priceless discovery of a European hard-paste, August chose Albrechtsburg Castle 
in Meissen as the place where "white gold" should be produced. 
</P>
<P>
High on a hill above the town's rooftops, the Gothic castle afforded a 
commanding view of the Elbe River Valley and all who approached it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1720 artist and chemist Johann Hoeroldt arrived in Meissen to join Boettger. 
His goal: to develop paints that would surpass the colors of the Far East. With 
white gold and its lovely secret-formula paints in production, only one 
ingredient was lacking -- design. 
</P>
<P>
Enter artist Johann Joachim Kaendler. In 1731 Kaendler, who would become one of 
the greatest porcelain designers of all time, joined the Meissen family. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Asian designs had been copied. Under his superb direction, however, 
Meissen porcelain took on a distinctly European and contemporary style. German 
porcelain began to enjoy international fame. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting the Meissen showrooms, explore the medieval market square, 
stroll along the winding cobbled streets of the old city or stop to sip Meissen 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
For a splendid view, go to the castle with its adjacent cathedral. It has no 
car access, but lots of steps lead up not far from the market square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Unusual Staircase 
</P>
<P>
The castle is noted for its unusual cylindrical wooden staircase and an 
exhibition centering on the years it held alchemist Boettger captive. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, before you leave the city, visit the small Meissen china store 
on the main square. 
</P>
<P>
Inside this exclusive and expensive store my German friends, avid porcelain 
connoisseurs, assured me that I would find a beautiful plate at a good price. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret," they explained, "is to turn over a plate and look at the 
trademark. Two scratches through the blue-crossed swords means a second. Sehr 
gut -- a markdown!" 
</P>
<P>
By then I had accrued an enormous respect for the white gold. With shimmers of 
excitement I chose an exquisitely painted plate trimmed in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Picking out a piece of Meissen was like selecting a diamond . . . I knew it 
would be forever. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Meissen is about a half-hour drive west of Dresden. Visas are required for the 
German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Not all travel agencies, however, 
are familiar with the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The German Democratic Republic Embassy, Washington, D.C., recommends contacting 
Kaven Travel Service, 1160 N. Central Ave., Suite 208-A, Glendale 91202, (213) 
245-9999 or (818) 502-9999. Kaven also has an office at 833 W. Torrance Blvd., 
Torrance 90502, (213) 532-9999. 
</P>
<P>
You will be asked for the exact dates of your stay in East Germany, and where 
you will be overnighting each day. If you plan to stay in hotels, allow three 
weeks for visa application processing. If you'll be staying with relatives or 
friends, allow two months. 
</P>
<P>
Kaven charges a $25 handling fee for processing visa applications that require 
hotel accommodations. The cost per person per night at an East German hotel is 
$70 to $200, depending on the class of hotel and its location. 
</P>
<P>
All hotel accommodations must be prepaid. Kaven handles all reservations and 
hotel payments. 
</P>
<P>
If you overnight with friends or relatives, a visa application costs $45. 
</P>
<P>
At the East German border, you are only required to buy a minimum of 25 East 
German marks for each day in the country. For children 6 to 15, the exchange 
requirement is 7.50 marks a day. Children under 6 do not have to exchange 
money. The exchange rate is the same as that for the West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
If you have prepaid hotel reservations you are not required to buy East German 
marks at the border -- the 25-mark-per-day exchange requirement is included in 
the daily cost of your room. 
</P>
<P>
When you register at a hotel, you'll be asked to leave your passport at the 
desk. Hotel management will take your passport to the police and return it the 
next day. If you overnight with relatives or friends, you must register with 
the police the day you arrive. 
</P>
<P>
You are not allowed to take East German marks out of the country. Keep all 
exchange receipts and receipts for any gifts you buy in the country. You may be 
asked to account for your East German marks when you leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
If you have leftover East German marks, you must deposit them at the border. 
According to the German Democratic Embassy, on your next visit to East Germany 
your marks will be returned to you at the border, if you have your deposit 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on travel to East Germany, contact the German Democratic 
Republic Embassy, Consular Division, 1717 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington, 
D.C. 20036, phone (202) 232-3134. 
</P>
<P>
Times to call for visa information are Monday and Friday from 6:30 to 9 a.m. 
PST, and Wednesday from 9:30 to 11 a.m.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: CHECK OUT FINE PRINT ON RATES BEFORE CHECKING IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's summer touring season again and time to review the discounts and deals 
being offered by major chain and franchise hotel and motel companies. 
</P>
<P>
First some caveats. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that discounts are just marketing tools to lure mature travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Things can change quickly in the lodging industry. Offers can be altered or 
even dropped after a change in management. 
</P>
<P>
More frequently, individual hotels have the right to suspend senior or other 
discounts for special events, or just limit the number of discounted rooms they 
offer during peak seasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Phrases 
</P>
<P>
It's important to check such key phrases as "good only at participating 
properties" or "subject to space availability" or "not offered on minimum-rate 
rooms." 
</P>
<P>
Although the industry is getting much better at eliminating these exclusions 
from their senior rate programs, they still pop up. 
</P>
<P>
When making reservations, check to make sure that the discount is in effect 
during your stay; double-check before you check in at the accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
And make sure that the senior discount is the lowest rate available. 
Frequently, hotels and motels offer weekend specials that could include lower 
rates or meals, that are not known to the national reservation service. Often, 
these kinds of specials are a better buy than a regular room at a senior 
discount. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proof of Age 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to have a membership card for AARP, Mature Outlook or another 
recognized organization, plus a driver's license, passport or other proof of 
age. Social Security cards don't help. 
</P>
<P>
Discounts of 10% are common. Many "Mobil Travel Guide" accommodations provide 
them, as does the American Automobile Assn. But don't expect to double your 10% 
discount if you belong to both AAA and AARP. 
</P>
<P>

$200-MILLION PROJECT OPENING NEAR LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first phase of Pacific Concourse, opening Thursday near Los Angeles 
International Airport, is more than just another mixed-use business campus: 
It's the first large-scale real estate project originated by the Economic 
Development Corp., on behalf of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The $200-million, 30-acre project at 118th Street and La Cienega Boulevard is 
in Del Aire, an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County between El Segundo 
and Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
The project will serve as a buffer between the freeways and the remaining 
houses and will bring suburban amenities to an area cleared for the Century 
(105) and San Diego (405) Freeway interchange, according to Stanley Moore of 
Overton, Moore &amp; Associates (OMA), Carson. 
</P>
<P>
OMA is the project's developer with Copley Real Estate Advisors, a unit of 
Boston-based New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. The architect is the Nadel 
Partnership, Los Angeles. Project financing is being provided by Wells Fargo 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase includes two 68,086-square-foot, three-story buildings and one 
91,400-square-foot, four-story building, Moore said. The second and third 
phases will add five buildings, including a hotel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Economic Development Corp. President Reginald Bottger said the 8-year-old, 
not-for-profit group working for the county brought residents of the Del Aire 
area into the design process from the beginning, after the EDC bought the land 
at the southwest quadrant of the interchange from the California Department of 
Transportation for about $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, as part the negotiations with the community, OMA agreed to spend 
$10 million on landscaping and infrastructure at Pacific Concourse. 
Landscaping, designed by Emmet L. Wemple &amp; Associates, includes an 
artificial lake, a jogging track and a two-hole chip-and-putt golf layout. 
</P>
<P>
Bottger said the agreement with OMA Del Aire Properties calls for EDC to lease 
the land for 75 years, starting at about $400,000 a year and escalating to 
about $800,000. The money will be used to expand business counseling, 
international trade and investment, business promotion and retention and small 
business loan programs throughout the county and in the Century Freeway 
Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the project should create between 2,000 and 2,500 jobs and 
generate $2 million a year in property taxes for the county. 
</P>
<P>
Donald W. Koch, OMA's vice president/marketing, believes that Pacific Concourse 
will create its own market, distinct from the LAX/Century Boulevard office 
market that has about a 25% vacancy factor. The Seeley Co. is the leasing agent

TWO INDUSTRIAL SITES EXPANDED, MODERNIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two South Bay industrial sites are being expanded and updated by the Ratkovich 
Co. and Copley Real Estate Advisors at a total cost of $22 million. 
</P>
<P>

LONG BEACH SYMPHONY CONDUCTOR TUNES IN TO PEOPLE, WINS OVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JoAnn Falletta got a standing ovation recently. 
</P>
<P>
Rising from folding chairs next to tables loaded with homemade food ranging 
from beans to meatballs, the audience, all over 55, gave the new director of 
the Long Beach Symphony a rousing response. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all her adopted grandparents," quipped Mary Putnam, who had arranged the 
conductor's appearance at Leisure World, a retirement community in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But Falletta, 35, was not directing a concert. Instead she was shaking hands 
and eating a potluck dinner in an effort to do something she plans to do a lot 
more of as she begins her reign as head of the 54-year-old musical 
organization: taking the orchestra to the people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Enjoy Music 
</P>
<P>
"People feel inadequate to enjoy classical music, and they're absolutely not," 
Falletta said with the determined yet friendly intensity that is becoming her 
trademark. "They are afraid to come to classical concerts because we have 
unknowingly put music in an ivory tower. We have to break down those barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"For the American orchestra to survive, the director must be a (true) director 
-- he or she has to be involved in the community in every sense." 
</P>
<P>
That last item is an issue that has been something of a sore point in Long 
Beach ever since 1984 when the symphony canceled part of its season because of 
a $758,000 deficit. Eventually the orchestra, with a budget of about $1.5 
million, clawed its way back to financial health, largely by reorganizing its 
management, persuading creditors such as the Bank of America to renegotiate 
outstanding debts and the city of Long Beach to forgive $100,000 of a $175,000 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
A Blue Ribbon Task Force that was convened by the city at the time recommended, 
among other things, replacing director Murry Sidlin with a director more 
committed to Long Beach and more available for public relations and fund 
raising. Although he had been with the orchestra since 1979, Sidlin still 
maintained his primary residence in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing came of it, however. And eventually the recommendation seemed to have 
been forgotten as the orchestra, back on firm financial footing, appeared to be 
reaching new artistic heights under Sidlin's baton. 
</P>
<P>
Then two years ago, in a surprise move that created a flurry of protest, the 
symphony's board of directors announced that Sidlin's contract would not be 
renewed. Although board members never publicly provided a detailed explanation 
of their action, board president George M. Murchison hinted broadly at the time 
that it had to do with the conductor's apparent unwillingness to commit at 
least 50% of his time to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100 Days in City 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Sidlin's, Falletta's contract requires her to spend at least 100 days a 
year in the city. To honor that, she says she plans to give up one of her three 
other orchestral affiliations, that of music director of the Queens 
Philharmonic in New York. In addition, she serves as director of the Denver 
Chamber Orchestra and of the Bay Area Women's Philharmonic in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of New York with a degree from the Julliard School, Falletta, one of 
only a handful of successful women conductors in the country, was chosen for 
the Long Beach post from a field that initially included 250 applicants. 
Eventually the group was narrowed to five finalists, each of whom conducted the 
orchestra in a guest appearance during the 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
Falletta, whose first regular Long Beach concert is scheduled for Sept. 16, 
says she will maintain an apartment in the city but doesn't yet know whether 
her husband, a computer engineer based in New York, will move to the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting People 
</P>
<P>
Last week, in her first visit to Long Beach since being named director in 
April, the soft-spoken maestro was in town hunting for an apartment and 
hobnobbing with orchestra administrators, patrons and would-be subscribers. The 
week culminated in the symphony association's annual meeting, at which Falletta 
delivered the keynote address outlining her four-pronged approach to taking the 
Long Beach Symphony into the future. 
</P>
<P>
First, she explained in an interview earlier, she plans to maintain and improve 
the orchestra's artistic quality, which she says has earned the respect of 
musicians throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Second, she said, she wants to "refine and polish" the niche occupied by the 
symphony in the cultural life of Southern California. Specifically, she said, 
she wants to begin performing music that isn't being performed elsewhere in the 
region, such as the lesser known works of such 19th- and 20th-Century European 
composers as Antonin Dvorak and Zoltan Kodaly. Third, she would like to begin 
emphasizing the works of younger, living American composers who need to have 
their work performed in order to advance in their artistic development. "Very 
often they are neglected," she said. "I feel that I have the responsibility of 
helping our culture take the next step forward by playing our own (composers) 
and letting them be heard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outreach Program 
</P>
<P>
And finally, Falletta said, she would like to initiate a more aggressive 
outreach program aimed at attracting people who have never attended a symphony 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, she said, she intends to send more small musical ensembles out to 
perform at area schools, design multimedia programs tailored to the tastes of 
young professionals, appeal to the city's diverse ethnic groups and generally 
maintain a visible presence in the various communities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go out and talk to them," she said, "they'll be willing to come to a 
concert." 
</P>
<P>
At Leisure World, where she circled the entire room to shake hands with each of 
the 73 senior citizens, the personal approach seemed to be working. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's wonderful," said Dorothy Wenger, a retired nurse. "She looks so 
young. She has a warmth that would inspire anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Said Priscilla Furjanic, whose late husband, Nick, was the symphony's first 
concertmaster: "She's got a sparkle. She's got some life to her."

MOLECULAR SCIENTIST ZIPS ALONG ON FAST TRACK WITH LASER STUDY, AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The speed of everything around him, compared to life in his native Egypt, 
stunned Ahmed Zewail the moment he landed in America. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for five minutes I just had to stand there and absorb this whole new 
culture," the Caltech professor of chemical physics said of that moment 20 
years ago in a Philadelphia airport. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with one major honor following another, Zewail is receiving international 
recognition for recording the formation and breaking of molecular bonds, a 
phenomenon that takes place so fast many scientists thought it could never be 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
Zewail's career is on a fast track. This spring, at 43, he was named to the 
prestigious National Academy of Sciences, whose members are usually in their 
mid-50s when they are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Academy membership came right on the heels of the 1989 King Faisal 
International Prize in Science, which Zewail received in Saudi Arabia for 
"pioneering and excellent work on ultra-fast laser chemistry." Zewail received 
$100,000 along with the award. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbol of Success 
</P>
<P>
In an interview between celebrations at Caltech in Pasadena, the ebullient 
Zewail theorized that his airport introduction to America was symbolic of his 
later success. 
</P>
<P>
"It is because of this speed, this ability to move fast and cut through 
bureaucracy, that we can achieve quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues say Zewail adds enthusiasm and excitement to painstaking work on 
projects that require years to complete. But they say that he is extremely 
cautious and insists on absolute proof before allowing any of the results from 
projects he supervises to be published. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph Marcus, Caltech professor of chemistry, called Zewail "fearless, and an 
outstanding scientist." 
</P>
<P>
"He has a good eye for important problems and is willing to do everything that 
has to be done to get a solution," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studies and Research 
</P>
<P>
Zewail arrived at Caltech in 1976, after earning a bachelor's degree at 
Alexandria University in Egypt and graduate degrees at the University of 
Pennsylvania and UC Berkeley, where he did postdoctoral work. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, he was able to predict his Caltech research team's ability to "look at 
the moment of birth of a molecule." 
</P>
<P>
"A year later we saw it happen. It was a wonderful celebration," he said, 
waving toward empty Champagne bottles that still decorate a corner of his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his scientific achievement in family terms, Zewail said: "Molecules 
A and B meet, marry and beget the species. This takes place in one millionth of 
a billionth of a second. This is a fundamental process in nature, and the world 
was looking for a way to be able to see the process. But many brilliant people 
said it couldn't be done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laser-Captured Instant 
</P>
<P>
Using a laser as if it were a camera, and recording the phenomena through the 
use of a computer, Zewail said the laser could record in millionths of a 
billionth of a second, which is called a femtosecond. 
</P>
<P>
He described a femtosecond as equal to the time it takes light to travel one 
one-hundredth of the width of a human hair. Another analogy he uses is: "A 
femtosecond is comparable to one second in 32 million years. It is like 
watching a 32-million-year movie to see one second." 
</P>
<P>
The "marrying and birth" of molecules was recorded and proved repeatedly in his 
laboratory by a team working with him. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bernstein, a UCLA professor of chemistry and a member of the National 
Academy of Sciences, was a visiting scholar at Caltech working with Zewail's 
research team when proof of the molecular action was recorded in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said that, in applying laser physics to molecular bonding, Zewail was 
successful with "a concept that had been only a curiosity. He made it a useful 
tool." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mastering Molecules 
</P>
<P>
"Once we understand how molecules are formed, we can manipulate them," Zewail 
said. "If you can manipulate molecules you can manipulate genes and matter, you 
can synthesize new material -- the implications are just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Far from completing his project, Zewail said the breakthrough "establishes what 
we have to work on for five to 10 years, as we try to understand why molecules 
love each other and hate each other. There is a lot of analogy between 
molecules and humans, but they are perhaps smarter." 
</P>
<P>
Doctoral student Marcos Dantus said Zewail "gets very excited, and that 
definitely has an impact on science. He will come to the lab or will keep 
calling, even if it's midnight, so you feel tremendous enthusiasm. And if we're 
down he'll give us a pep talk, like this is the most important thing in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
That excitement, Dantus said, stems from Zewail's "unusually strong intuition 
-- his feeling that comes from having done all the necessary research. It's an 
unusual characteristic for a scientist." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Love for Science 
</P>
<P>
Zewail traces his love for science to his family's encouragement and to the 
Egyptian educational system, which gives a lot of support to scholars. 
</P>
<P>
"The dream of my family was for me to be an educated person," he said, 
describing a well-rounded childhood in Alexandria with three sisters, all of 
whom have college educations. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm sort of a hero, and when I go there it's in all the newspapers," he 
said. "(Egyptians) see me as one of their people who can go to the United 
States and do something important and they are very, very proud." 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived to study at the University of Pennsylvania in 1969, he said, "I 
immediately saw the difference between Egypt and us. I was so impressed by the 
way things go so fast, without so much bureaucracy. There is this element of 
the importance of time." 
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech when he received the King Faisal prize, Zewail 
credited his success to his family, to Egypt for his excellent early education, 
to Caltech for creating a good scientific atmosphere, and to colleagues and the 
78 graduate and postdoctoral students who have worked with him during his 13 
years at Caltech.

COUNTY STUDIES 10 ALTERNATIVES FOR DISPOSING OF L.A.'S TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The county Sanitation Districts are studying 10 proposals from major waste 
haulers, railroads and entrepreneurs offering to take trash from Los Angeles 
County to the desert by train to be recycled, buried or burned. 
</P>
<P>
One company proposes to load 7,000 tons of trash a day on trains in City of 
Industry, Irwindale and La Verne and haul the waste 185 miles to an abandoned 
iron ore pit in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Another company would build a waste separation and recycling plant at Puente 
Hills landfill near Hacienda Heights and ship trash by rail to a plant near 
Victorville for processing into construction materials. 
</P>
<P>
And a third company proposes to accept the rail-shipment of all the waste 
generated every day in Los Angeles County -- 45,000 tons -- at a dump in Kern 
County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trash Exportation 
</P>
<P>
The proposals were submitted to the county Sanitation Districts in response to 
a request for proposals for the design, financing and development of systems to 
export trash from Los Angeles County to remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
The districts issued the request for proposals at the urging of the San Gabriel 
Valley Assn. of Cities, which began looking into the feasibility of rail-haul 
in 1986 as an alternative to trash-burning plants proposed in Irwindale, Puente 
Hills and Pomona. Environmental opposition killed the trash-burning projects, 
but cities have continued to pursue the rail-haul alternative. 
</P>
<P>
A study undertaken by the Southern California Assn. of Governments last year 
found that hauling trash from the San Gabriel Valley to remote disposal sites 
by rail is "technically feasible and offers a potential solution to the solid 
waste disposal crisis projected for the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
The report by the regional planning agency noted that landfills in Los Angeles 
County are nearing capacity and that recycling is only a partial solution. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 58% of the county's trash goes to landfills in the San Gabriel 
Valley and nearby Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Landfill 
</P>
<P>
The county's largest landfill, Puente Hills, is so busy that it is often closed 
to trash trucks by noon because it has reached its daily permitted limit of 
13,200 tons. Other landfills also are operating at capacity and county 
officials have predicted that by 1992, the amount of trash being generated may 
exceed the available landfill space by 6,000 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts are exploring six potential landfill sites in Los 
Angeles County, but there are numerous obstacles, such as opposition from 
neighbors and stringent environmental regulations, which could delay or kill 
the projects. Thus, the Sanitation Districts have begun looking into the 
feasibility of shipping trash out of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Carry, chief engineer and general manager of the Sanitation 
Districts, said the rail-haul proposals received from private companies ranged 
from letters a few pages long to books thick with technical detail. Some of the 
proposals, he said, "are well thought out and rather complete. Others are 
little more than an expression of interest." 
</P>
<P>
His staff will evaluate the proposals and plans to report its initial findings 
to the waste management task force of the San Gabriel Valley Assn. of Cities on 
June 27. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Harvey, task force chairman, said he has not seen the proposals, but the 
fact that they have come from railroads and major firms in the waste disposal 
industry is encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with the extent of interest shown," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competitive Prices 
</P>
<P>
What remains to be seen, he said, is whether trash can be sent to the desert 
for disposal at prices that are competitive with other options and whether such 
difficult problems as finding acceptable sites for loading the trains can be 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the difficulties are already apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Mine Reclamation Corp. has proposed building waste-loading stations in La 
Verne, Irwindale and Industry and hauling 7,000 tons of trash a day by rail to 
a disposal site at Eagle Mountain in Riverside County. Gary Kovall, senior vice 
president and general counsel of Mine Reclamation, said the company notified La 
Verne, Irwindale and Industry of proposed train-loading locations and, he said, 
"I would not describe their reaction as one of open arms." 
</P>
<P>
"Industry was the most open," Kovall said. "Irwindale was negative and La Verne 
was like, 'You've got to be kidding.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two of the proposed sites, along Southern Pacific railroad lines in Industry 
and Irwindale, were suggested in the study by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. The third site, across from Brackett Field in La Verne, was found 
independently by Mine Reclamation Corp. But Harvey, a member of the La Verne 
City Council, said that the site appears to conflict with plans to develop a 
103-acre research and development complex. 
</P>
<P>
Kovall stressed that Mine Reclamation Corp. is not wedded to any particular 
loading site. 
</P>
<P>
"We have mentioned our interest in having about 10 acres in those areas (of 
Industry, Irwindale and La Verne)," he said. "But that is very preliminary. We 
have not made any steps to acquire real estate or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Existing Landfills 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Kovall said, the better approach may well be to use existing 
landfills, such as Spadra in Pomona or Puente Hills, as sites to receive trash, 
separate glass, plastics, metals and other materials for recycling and then 
compact and load the remaining waste into 20-foot long containers that could be 
trucked to a rail line and loaded onto rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
Kovall said his company is willing to explore a wide range of options with the 
Sanitation Districts or the cities that would be served. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Collins III, president and chief executive officer of Mine 
Reclamation, said the location of train-loading stations will be based "on 
which municipalities want to go ahead and rail-haul to Eagle Mountain. There's 
no point in having a transfer station in the east end of the San Gabriel Valley 
if you're going to be moving waste from the west end or the north end." 
</P>
<P>
Mine Reclamation's chief asset is its 100-year lease on 8,000 acres at the 
Eagle Mountain mine, near Desert Center. 
</P>
<P>
The mine was opened in 1948 to supply iron ore to the Kaiser steel mill in 
Fontana and was closed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said the mine's east pit is large enough to receive 16,000 tons of 
trash a day for 100 years. Kaiser Steel Resources Inc., which owns the mine, 
would receive a portion of the trash disposal fee under its lease arrangement 
with Mine Reclamation. Mine Reclamation is a privately held corporation whose 
owners include Herzog Contracting Corp., a San Diego landfill management firm; 
EDCO Disposal, a waste collection company based in Lemon Grove in San Diego 
County, and Itel Corp., a Chicago firm that leases railroad cars and other 
transportation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riverside Plan 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside County Board of Supervisors has instructed its staff to negotiate 
an agreement with Mine Reclamation that would give the county a fee for 
allowing the importation of trash to Eagle Mountain. County officials said 
their approval of the project will depend on whether the landfill operation and 
rail-haul can be accomplished with environmental safety and whether it will 
benefit the area economically. 
</P>
<P>
Mine Reclamation earlier this month filed an application with Riverside County 
for a land-use permit, specific plan and zone changes at Eagle Mountain. The 
project will require environmental impact studies and permits from various 
governmental agencies. Company officials said the landfill could be in 
operation by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the proposals submitted to the Sanitation Districts did not specify 
where trash trains would be loaded, but at least three of the proposals would 
serve the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
International Technology Corp. of Torrance and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa 
Fe Railway Co. proposed a system that would handle 6,000 tons of trash a day. 
The plan calls for processing waste at landfills at Puente Hills, Spadra, 
Calabasas and Scholl Canyon in Glendale, to remove materials that can be 
recycled. The remainder would then be put in containers to be hauled by truck 
to the City of Commerce and then by train to Adelanto and Needles in San 
Bernardino County. Plants in those desert communities would turn the refuse 
into fuel for factories or use it to generate electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Re-Use of Waste 
</P>
<P>
Western Product Recovery Group Inc. of Escondido and the Union Pacific Corp. 
proposed a plan for 3,500 tons of trash a day at Puente Hills landfill. A 
processing plant would be built at Puente Hills to separate materials for 
recycling and to process refuse into fuel. Some refuse would be shipped by 
truck to the City of Commerce for transfer to trains bound for the Victorville 
area, where a plant would be established to produce construction materials. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Chan, supervisor of solid waste planning with the Sanitation Districts, 
said a number of companies submitted proposals without specifying where trash 
would be loaded onto trains. Other companies, she said, asked that potential 
loading sites, proposed disposal rates and other information be kept 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Western Waste Industries Inc. of Gardena proposed a system to handle 12,000 
tons of trash a day at a rate of $65 to $75 a ton, but asked that loading 
stations and disposal sites remain confidential. Browning-Ferris Industries of 
California Inc. did not specify loading stations or disposal sites, but 
estimated that it could develop a system that could handle 16,000 tons of trash 
a day at a rate of $60 to $90 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Sage Resources of Los Angeles and the United States Borax and Chemical Corp. 
offered disposal sites in Kern County, but did not submit plans for hauling the 
trash there. Earth Technology Corp. of Long Beach proposed a Kern County 
disposal site that could handle 45,000 tons of trash a day. 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management of North America Inc. and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe 
Railway Co. proposed a system to take 6,000 tons of trash a day from the City 
of Commerce and El Segundo to a landfill at Amboy in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disposal Costs 
</P>
<P>
Railex Special Projects Group of Vancouver, British Columbia, proposed the 
rail-haul of up to 13,000 tons of trash a day from unspecified locations to 
various refuse-to-energy plants in Barstow and other San Bernardino County 
communities. The firm said the cost would be $28 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Carry, the Sanitation Districts' general manager, said he believes that the 
$28-per-ton figure is unrealistically low. 
</P>
<P>
Disposal rates at landfills in Los Angeles County currently range from $10 to 
$25 a ton. The rail-haul study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments 
last year estimated that trash could be shipped from the San Gabriel Valley and 
disposed of in remote sites for $29 to $41 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Mine Reclamation declined to disclose its proposed disposal rate, but Kovall, 
its general counsel, said the amount is under $50 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
One of the difficulties in creating a rail-haul system is overcoming the 
competitive disadvantage of comparatively cheap disposal rates at local 
landfills.

<P>
Tom Kite rode a string of four birdies in a six-hole stretch into a one-stroke 
lead Saturday in the weather-plagued third round of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
The gritty little Texan, who has come so close so often but has yet to win one 
of world's major tests of golfing greatness, patiently compiled a one-under-par 
69 in sunshine and showers on a saturated golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Kite completed three trips over the rain-soaked and weather-damaged East course 
at the Oak Hill Country Club in 205, five shots under par. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of consecutive titles in the Bay Hill Classic and Players 
Championship earlier this year, Kite swept in front with his birdie burst in 
the middle of the round, then had to scramble through trees and traps to hold 
off Scott Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, the soft-spoken man who won the 1987 American national championship, 
kept pace with a 69 and was one back at 206 going into today's final round. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange, the defending champion and second-round leader, faded back and 
now faces a major challenge in his attempt to become the first golfer since Ben 
Hogan in 1951 to successfully defend his title in this event. 
</P>
<P>
Strange did not make a birdie in a 73 that was nine shots higher than the 64 he 
shot in second-round play. It was his highest score in Open competition in the 
last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Strange takes a 208 total -- three back -- into the last 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Open winner Larry Nelson, Japanese veteran Mashashi (Jumbo) Ozaki 
and longshot Jay Don Blake were the only others in the field under par for 54 
holes. They were at 209. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson and Ozaki each shot 68 and Blake 72. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Pernice and Mark McCumber were at par 210. Pernice rallied for a 68 and 
McCumber had a 72. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, 49, who counts four U.S. Open crowns among his record 18 major 
professional titles, took himself out of it with another 74 that left him at 
215. 
</P>
<P>
Masters champion Nick Faldo of England, the man who lost to Strange in a 
playoff for this title a year ago and was considered a strong contender this 
time, had a 73 and was at 213. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish star Seve Ballesteros was 76-221. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, who now has three rounds in the 60s in this event, came into the delayed 
start of the day's play one shot back. 
</P>
<P>
He was two off the pace when he began his birdie burst on the ninth hole. Using 
his newly adopted cross-handed putting stroke, he ran in a monster putt, 40 or 
50 feet, for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
When the struggling Strange bogeyed the hole after driving into the rough, Kite 
found himself in a three-way tie for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
But another long birdie putt, perhaps 20 feet, on the 10th put a spring in his 
step and another birdie, from about 10 feet, on the 12th put him in front 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't look back. 
</P>
<P>
He led the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't easy. Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
He had to contend with the enormous pressure of the American national 
championship, a four-man race to the wire, a series of showers, a 
greatly-delayed starting time and extremely slow play. It required the 
threesome of Kite, Strange and Simpson more than five hours to complete 18 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
The start of play was delayed more than four hours by heavy overnight rains 
that sent a creek out of its banks and flooded low-lying portions of the golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Fire department equipment was called in to pump the areas flooded by Allen's 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"The most damage I've ever seen on a golf course," said P.J. Boatwright, the 
veteran executive director of rules and competition for the sponsoring U.S. 
Golf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy delay prompted U.S.G.A. officials to rearrange pairings and 
starting times. 
</P>
<P>
From twosomes, they went to groups of three and, for the first time in the 
history of this event, used both the first and 10th tees as starting points. 
</P>
<P>
Both Strange and Kite had trouble starting out. 
</P>
<P>
Strange bogeyed the second after reaching two bunkers. Kite had to scramble for 
one-putt pars on the second and third, then bogeyed the next two. He missed the 
green on the fourth and three-putted the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Kite had to make a save from the wet sand of a bunker on the seventh to stay in 
touch with the lead, then got his two-shot swing on the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
After the birdies on the 10th and 12th, he hit an approach to within six feet 
on the 14th and had a three-stroke lead with four holes to go. 
</P>
<P>
But He bogeyed the 15th, three-putting again, and Simpson cut the margin to one 
with a birdie at 16. 
</P>
<P>
Although he trails only Nicklaus and Tom Watson on the all-time money-winning 
list, Kite has not received the recognition accorded other players of his era. 
</P>
<P>
The only major drawback to a career that has produced Player of the Year 
honors, and leading money-winner and the Vardon Trophy -- among others -- is 
his lack of a victory in any of the game's Big Four events, the Masters, U.S. 
and British Opens and the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more frustrating are the frequent occasions when he's challenged 
and failed in those major tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a runner-up in two Masters, and led another at one point over the 
final 18 holes. He also has a second place finish in the British Open, and 
again led another at one point on the final nine holes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 39, he has another opportunity to acquire the one major title he needs 
to confirm his place in the game.

PISTONS WIN TITLE WITH HUGE ASTERISK ATTACHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Get out the asterisk, and make it the giant size. Now, attach it to Detroit's 
sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Maris is off the hook, if you know what I mean. The Pistons are 
officially champions of the National Basketball Association, but they had to 
struggle mightily to beat a crippled Lakers team that would be fortunate to 
compete with the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Lakers weren't making any excuses Tuesday night, I'll make them for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
You had only to look at the bench. See Magic Johnson in sweats and a Lakers 
T-shirt. See Byron Scott in a suit. See the Lakers all dressed up with nowhere 
to go, and yet, for the three consecutive games, they played the Pistons into 
the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
A healthy Lakers team probably wins another NBA championship. Find two working 
hamstrings and marry them to Johnson and Scott, and the king, now officially 
dead, might be breathing yet. 
</P>
<P>
The bad boys were bad. I don't mean rough (though Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn 
did their part). I mean bad. I mean that Isiah Thomas was hardly a factor and 
that Mark Aguirre might as well have been on the end of leash. 
</P>
<P>
The white-hot intensity that had marked their defense all year rarely surfaced. 
What we did see, however, was inspiring play from Joe Dumars and the expected 
unconscious offense from Vinnie Johnson and more inspiration from Dennis Rodman 
and important points from Mahorn and James Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Already deeper than the opposition, the Pistons, in the end, swamped the 
Lakers, who once had a 16-point lead but would need important minutes from the 
likes of Jeff Lamp and David Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
And so, a sweep. And with it, the end of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who looked as if 
the time machine he discovered in Game 3 had suddenly lurched wildly into the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
He went out with seven points and three rebounds and the roar of the Lakers' 
crowd. His teammates gave him an ovation, and so did the Pistons. The 24 points 
and 13 rebounds he managed on Sunday would have been the way to go out, but you 
don't get to pick your endings in real life. 
</P>
<P>
It was an uncharacteristic finish for Abdul-Jabbar, who has helped define 
basketball for a generation and more. With three NCAA championships and six 
more in 20 NBA seasons, Abdul-Jabbar has suffered few such defeats in his 
career. The wounded Lakers looked to him one last time, but Abdul-Jabbar, human 
after all, is 42, without hair and now, finally, retired. It was time to take 
the sky hook and go home. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Lakers found James Worthy, last year's MVP in this series, who 
scored a career-high 40 points. He wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Pistons who fell last year in seven games in a series they might 
have won and who came back to put together the best record in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Before the playoffs, they were the best team. Once the playoffs began, the 
Lakers became the Lakers again, unbeaten through 11 games and dominant as of 
old. 
</P>
<P>
It looked like a great matchup until Scott was lost before Game 1 and Johnson 
during Game 2. The series was over when Johnson, who tried to play in Game 3, 
couldn't. The Lakers could have played out the string, but they didn't. Maybe 
that's how you win five championships in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
As the game began, it was suggested that, with Magic on the bench, Isiah Thomas 
might kiss Tony Campbell at the tap. In fact, of those three great friends -- 
Thomas, Johnson and Aguirre -- Johnson made by far the greatest contribution. 
He provided inspiration; he provided a lift. You knew where he was -- on the 
bench, rooting his giant heart out. 
</P>
<P>
For much of the game, you couldn't find his two buddies. Aguirre, of course, 
has made a career of losing big games, dating back to all those early-round 
losses playing with DePaul. A controversial midseason trade, some say 
engineered by Thomas, sent Adrian Dantley in exchange for Aguirre, who will, as 
a result, win his first ring -- if he has the guts to wear it. 
</P>
<P>
A career 25-points-a-game scorer, Aguirre scored 28 points in the first three 
games of this series. Those, of course, were the good old days. With the 
Pistons struggling Tuesday night, Aguirre scored two points. 
</P>
<P>
But it's his little friend, Isiah, the transcendent talent, who truly 
disappoints. He scored 14 points. But it was Dumars, again, who stepped up when 
the game counted. Thomas cried at the end, and he's a great player, but when 
you see him on the floor with Magic Johnson, you understand where greatness 
resides. 
</P>
<P>
As the Lakers decade ends, it won't be with a "three-peat." It will be with the 
Pistons, one of only five teams to play in the finals in the 1980s. The Pistons 
are a fine team. The Lakers might have been better, though. It's something, of 
course, that we'll never know.

DODGER OFFENSE CONTINUES TO SPUTTER IN LOSS TO BRAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tom Lasorda had seen enough. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger manager raced from the third-base coaching box to confront plate 
umpire Mike Winters after Eddie Murray struck out swinging to end the sixth 
inning in Saturday night's game against the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted to do was talk to him," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
But Winters didn't want to talk to Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
Winters ejected Lasorda, who first moved in close to Winters at the plate, then 
continued to rage at third-base umpire Bob Engel. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation concluded with Lasorda making a gesture at Engel with his 
right hand as he walked to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda's outburst was the biggest Dodger explosion on a night when they lost, 
2-1, to the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda was still seething after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"When the hell has there been a rule that you can't go talk to the umpire?" 
Lasorda asked. "He threw me out before I came down to talk to him. Go ask him 
why he threw me out." 
</P>
<P>
Winters said of Lasorda: "He said a few things about balls and strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda had other worries, namely the Dodgers' anemic offense. 
</P>
<P>
A Dodger Stadium crowd of 42,940 saw Brave starter Pete Smith and relievers 
Paul Assenmacher and Joe Boever limit the Dodgers to seven hits as Atlanta beat 
Los Angeles for the second straight night. 
</P>
<P>
Murray continued to slump, striking out three times before drawing an 
eighth-inning walk. And leadoff hitter Kirk Gibson went hitless in four 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got to start hitting, that's what they've got to do," Lasorda said. 
"They've got to start scoring runs. It's very simple." 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan lit the Dodgers' only offensive fire, lining a pinch double to 
left field with one out in the eighth inning. After Gibson flew out to short 
left, Willie Randolph drove in Duncan, lining a double off the left-field wall 
over the leaping Lonnie Smith. But Boever struck out pinch-hitter Franklin 
Stubbs to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 2-1, in the ninth, Duncan came to the plate with runners on first and 
second and two out. But Boever struck out Duncan to earn his 10th save of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
After breaking out of a slump in their five-game winning streak, the Dodgers 
have returned to form, scoring just two runs in losing the first two games of a 
three-game series against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Dion James gave the Braves a 1-0 lead when he homered into the right-field box 
seats to open the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
James' home run was the only mistake made by Dodger starter Mike Morgan, who 
brought a league-leading 1.59 earned-run average into the game. But once again, 
the Dodger offense failed to support its pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger defense also failed in the eighth as the Braves scored an unearned 
run off Morgan to take a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Bruce Benedict opened the inning with a double to left, shortstop Alfredo 
Griffin botched Lonnie Smith's grounder as Benedict moved to third. Jeff 
Treadway, who homered in the Braves' 6-1 victory over the Dodgers Friday night, 
then drove in Benedict. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, sidelined with a sore right shoulder since losing to the Dodgers June 5, 
struck out five before leaving after the sixth inning when he felt a twinge in 
his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"(Smith) had his best command of his pitches," Atlanta Manager Russ Nixon said. 
"Tonight, he did a lot to build up his confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Mike Marshall, eligible to come off the disabled list Wednesday, 
will not accompany the Dodgers Monday when they leave on a six-game trip. 
Marshall, who was put on the 21-day disabled list May 31 because of back 
spasms, is still undergoing rehabilitation. Dr. Robert Watkins met with Manager 
Tom Lasorda, General Manager Fred Claire, Marshall and other Dodger officials 
before Saturday night's game to review Marhsall's treatment. "I'm hopeful that 
we will have him the second half of the season," Claire said. . . . Claire said 
the Dodgers aren't working on a trade to acquire outfielder Dan Gladden of the 
Minnesota Twins, who said he hopes to play in Los Angeles. "If (Gladden) says 
he's coming here, he knows a lot more than I know about it," Claire said. . . . 
Dodger left-hander John Tudor, still recovering from shoulder and elbow 
surgery, is scheduled to make his second rehabilitation start tonight for the 
Bakersfield Dodgers gainst San Bernardino in Bakersfield. He pitched five 
innings in his first start June 7 in Vero Beach, Fla. . . . Mickey Hatcher, 
sidelined since June 3 with a strained left hamstring, hopes to come off the 
disabled list Monday. Hatcher tested his hamstring by running in the outfield 
before Saturday night's game. . . . The Dodgers end their home stand today when 
Fernando Valenzuela (2-5) opposes Zane Smith at 2 p.m. The game will be 
preceeded by an old-timers' game featuring players from the Dodgers' six World 
Series championship teams.

JIM MURRAY: A MAJOR WIN WOULD BREAK KITE'S STRING

<P>
If you saw Tom Kite hanging around the clubhouse or first tee at your club, 
chances are you'd try to get a game with him. You might even be tempted to 
offer him shots. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, he doesn't look like a guy you'd call The Hawk, or The Slammer. He's no 
Golden Bear. What he looks like is a guy who might yip a three-foot putt. Who 
might choke if the press bets get in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, there are those glasses. They're just smaller than truck 
windshields or department store windows. He has this curly red hair and 
freckles. He grins a lot. If he had a dog, he could play Little Orphan Annie. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't want him for a partner in a four-ball at Wilshire or even a 
Saturday scramble on your home muni course. 
</P>
<P>
He's one of the best golfers in the world but don't tell anybody. He's a 
well-kept secret. Tom cooperates with that image. Tom likes to creep up on you. 
Also, on a golf course or a tournament. He doesn't like to wake it up and have 
it fight back. 
</P>
<P>
He's leading the U.S. Open as the sun sets over the hills of western New York 
and the storm clouds continue to hover over the Oak Hill site of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Tom is not supposed to be leading tournaments. He's supposed to finish second. 
He does that better than anybody this side of the German Army. He's the 
Second-Hand Rose of the game. 
</P>
<P>
He is the third-leading money-winner of all time in the game, topped only by 
Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson. He is not flashy, charismatic, just good. He is 
so steady and consistent and unassuming, you'd hand him your coat at a party. 
Hollywood would cast him as the best friend. 
</P>
<P>
In a sport filled with club-throwers and tantrum-throwers, he is so 
good-natured you might ask him to watch your dog while you made a phone call. 
Some people at a Masters once asked him if he would mind taking their picture. 
He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
When most golfers win nearly $5 million, 12 tournaments, and finish in the top 
10 in 21 out of 26 tournaments in one year, people want them to write a book, 
go on the Tonight Show, give them instruction or design a line of clubs or 
clothes. With Kite, they say, "How come you never won a major?" 
</P>
<P>
It comes up to haunt Tom Kite. It's almost a standing lead: "Tom Kite, who has 
never won a major . . . " It may be on his gravestone. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably an historic injustice. Few players strike the ball with the 
consistent excellence of a Tom Kite. Few players have won as many tournaments. 
Only two have won more money. Almost none make the top 10 as regularly. 
</P>
<P>
But when he comes into the press tent at the U.S. Open here this week, the 
general questioning begins with a reporter tactfully clearing his throat and 
trying not to look insincere as he asks: "Tom, do you think a career can be 
fulfilled when you haven't won a major?" 
</P>
<P>
No one quite says: "Tom, do you choke when it's the Open or the Masters?" They 
don't have to. Kite knows where they're coming from. He's been there all his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
When he first came out of Texas as a young collegian, Tom Kite wasn't the 
hopeful of every locker room from Ft. Worth to the Rio Grande. Ben Crenshaw 
was. Tom got used to playing in the shadow. 
</P>
<P>
What he never got used to was the notion he was playing for money, not history. 
His style of play, so methodical if impeccable, created the suspicion that Tom 
Kite was a guy who would go for a sure four if the alternative was to risk an 
eight. They said he would go for the fat part of the green, the safe side of 
the fairway, the lag putt. He would make 72 if to try for 67 might lead to 79. 
</P>
<P>
A generation weaned on an Arnold Palmer, who played every hole as if he would 
make a two or a 12, quickly relegated Kite to a spear-carrier role. 
</P>
<P>
Was it a bum rap? Well, Tom Kite is not your basic Arnold Palmer athlete. 
Arnold was built along the lines of your stronger middleweight contender. He 
went after a golf course like Roberto Duran against a guy with a cut over his 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
Kite doesn't exactly romance the golf course but at 5-feet-8, 150 pounds, and 
with eyesight just good enough for the big E on the chart without glasses, Kite 
can never go the caveman route or for the one-round knockout. Kite is out to 
out-think the golf course. He can't cover up mistakes hitting a three-wood out 
of deep rough with a blacksmith's arms like a Snead or Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
He's not exactly defending himself against a golf course. He's just not trying 
to drag it back to the cave by the hair. 
</P>
<P>
It would be so fitting for him to win a National Open, it probably won't 
happen. Majors have been won by guys who seldom win anything else. 
</P>
<P>
The guys in the hunt with Kite as this Open goes into its final round include 
some who are as qualified and deserving as he -- but they also include two guys 
who have never won anything, two guys who have never won in this country, a guy 
who has already won his Open but only half as many tournaments as Kite. 
</P>
<P>
But who says a U.S. Open is fair? It's as full of malice as a park mugger. 
</P>
<P>
Kite sighs and admits he probably won't light up the course in the final round. 
"I'll probably come out there in some really flashy outfit," he grins. "A nice 
bold gray and a white visor. Black shoes, Navy slacks. I'll dazzle 'em." 
</P>
<P>
He'd really like to bore people to death. With a nice, undramatic, bogey-free 
round just good enough to win a U.S. Open by a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he expects it to re-do his image. The line will then say: "Tom Kite, 
who has won over $5 million but only one major. . . . " Tom will smile sweetly. 
He always does.

YONAMINE, FIRST AMERICAN TO PLAY IN JAPAN, WAS NOT AN INSTANT HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
He's been called the Jackie Robinson of Japanese baseball, and if that might be 
stretching things a bit, there is truth in what the designation implies. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Yonamine sat in the small Tokyo pearl shop he runs with his wife, Jane, 
in Tokyo's trendy, nightclub-dominated Roppongi district. From beneath their 
second-story shop, the moaning sounds of congested street traffic -- there is 
no other kind in Tokyo -- wafted up the stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
"You can call me the Jackie Robinson of Japanese baseball only in the sense 
that I was a pioneer, the first American, but not really in the sense of the 
kind of discrimination (Robinson) put up with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, at first the fans over here threw stuff at me and yelled at me, but I 
never had to deal with anything like Robinson did." 
</P>
<P>
For Robinson, who in 1947 became the first black in major league baseball, it 
was, "Nigger go home!" 
</P>
<P>
For Yonamine -- pronounced: Yo-na-meena -- who in 1950 became the first 
post-war American to play baseball in Japan, it was, "Yankee go home!" 
</P>
<P>
Since Yonamine made the leap from Class B baseball at Salt Lake City to the 
Yomiyuri Giants in Tokyo, about 350 Americans have played in Japan's major 
leagues since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first one, it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in what was then a tiny Maui village, Lahaina, the son of a father 
who had left Okinawa for Hawaii in 1907, at 17, as a contract sugar cane field 
laborer. His father died last year, at 98. Yonamine's mother, 89, who was born 
on Maui, lives in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a good athlete my first two years in high school on Maui, but the school 
was very small and my father wanted me to go to a big Honolulu school to play 
football," Yonamine said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years of World War II, Yonamine was a standout running back at 
Honolulu's Farrington High. He had a bow-legged, jump-start, slashing running 
style that caused almost as much excitement at Honolulu prep games as had the 
running of 'Squirmin' Herman Wedemeyer, two years older than Yonamine, who had 
gone from Hawaii high school stardom to St. Mary's College in California. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Honolulu newspaperman Bill Wong remembers Yonamine. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a slashing kind of running style that made him very hard to tackle," 
Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
"You could call him a prep superstar in the post-war period over here. A lot of 
old-time Hawaii people remember him very well." 
</P>
<P>
In a sports trivia encyclopedia, Yonamine could be named in three categories: 
</P>
<P>
 -- First American to play post-World War II baseball in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's possibly the only Japanese-American ever to play major league pro 
football in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's on the short list of those who have played NFL-level football with no 
college background, as did Cookie Gilchrist and Otis Sistrunk. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945, his dream was to play football at Ohio State, which had awarded him a 
football scholarship. But the world was still at war, and for a young, athletic 
Japanese-American, Ohio State was a goal out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
The day after he graduated from Farrington High in Honolulu, in June, 1945, he 
was drafted by the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured going in I was going to get shipped out to Italy (to the 442nd 
Regimental Combat Battalion, the heavily decorated all-Japanese-American unit 
that served in France and Italy)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But then the war in Europe ended and then Japan surrendered. So I spent two 
years at Schofield Barracks on Oahu, peeling potatoes and playing football and 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Yonamine must have caught the eye of at least one pro scout, because 
immediately upon his discharge, in 1947, he joined the San Francisco 49ers of 
the All America Football Conference as a reserve halfback. The 49ers joined the 
National Football League in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
In the club's 1947 team photo, which hangs on his pearl shop wall, Yonamine is 
in the back row, second from left. His salary that season was $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot to learn, so I sat on the bench for most of that '47 season," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing more in '48 until I broke my wrist. But by then I was playing a 
lot of off-season baseball, and thinking about pro baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Yonamine had been a headliner as a prep football player in Hawaii, but he had 
been equally adept at baseball. And in his Army stint, he played against the 
best competition in the world -- touring U.S. major leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
"I played against Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial -- I learned a lot of baseball in 
two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also met a San Franciscan named Lefty O'Doul, who as an 11-season National 
Leaguer hit a career .354. Later, he managed the Pacific Coast League's San 
Francisco Seals. 
</P>
<P>
"I had met Lefty O'Doul in Hawaii when he brought some major league all-stars 
over there during the war," Yonamine said. "He liked the way I played. 
</P>
<P>
"So after I got hurt with the 49ers, I contacted him. In 1948, he was managing 
the Seals. He signed me to a minor league contract and I was sent to Salt Lake 
City, which then was Class B ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd seen me play baseball. He knew I had some ability. By 1950 I was hitting 
.335 and playing center field pretty well. I was the No. 4 hitter in the 
league. But I wasn't hitting home runs, and I knew that would keep me out of 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"So Lefty suggested I take a crack at Japanese ball. I owe him a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a Honolulu friend named Sam Uehara who owned a cafe called the Smile 
Cafe, which was sort of a Honolulu athletes' hangout. He knew a lot of people 
in Japan and he set up the contacts for me. 
</P>
<P>
"But without O'Doul steering me in that direction in 1950, I have no idea where 
I'd be today." 
</P>
<P>
The day in 1951 that Yonamine arrived in Tokyo, after an 18-hour Pan American 
Clipper flight (with an hour's stop on Wake Island), the Yomiuri Giants signed 
him to a two-year contract and gave him a $2,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"I started at $185 a month and thought I'd struck it rich," he said. "In Salt 
Lake, I'd made $150 a month. And the Giants were paying my rent, too. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, day laborers in Japan made $20 a month." 
</P>
<P>
Yonamine joined the Giants that first year in mid-season, hiked his average to 
.354, drew lots of attention, and was approached by the team's owner in the 
locker room one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up to me and through an interpreter said, 'You look lonesome. I'm 
going to bring your wife over to join you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who had become intrigued by baseball when an all-star team 
featuring Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jimmy Foxx toured the country in 1934, had 
never seen the game played the way Wally Yonamine played it. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sort of a Maury Wills-Pete Rose type," said Ike Ikuhara, who is the 
Dodgers' liaison man with Japanese baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"He stole a lot of bases and he ran the bases unlike anyone over there before 
him. He wasn't real fast, but he could read pitchers very well and he knew a 
lot more about sliding than most Japanese players. 
</P>
<P>
"My recollection is no one had seen a hook slide executed as well as Wally did 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say Wally brought Little Ball to Japan. He was a great bunter. So 
many times, a throw would beat him to second base, but he'd beat the tag 
because of his sliding skills." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Yonamine won the Japanese over. In 1957, he became the first 
foreigner to win the most-valuable-player award in Japan. His batting average, 
.311, is among the highest ever compiled in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In his 11 seasons, he won three 1950s Central League batting championships with 
averages of .361, .338 and .343. 
</P>
<P>
As a manager, his 1974 Chunichi Dragons team won the Japan World Series -- but 
the team's owner fired him two years later. 
</P>
<P>
In Japanese baseball, players, coaches and managers tend to remain with their 
teams for considerably longer periods than is the case with the U.S. major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not Wally. In other words, you can move a Japanese-American in 
Japan, but you can't take the American out of him. 
</P>
<P>
"Wally has been with a lot of different clubs (six)) as a manager-coach," 
Ikuhara said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very unusual for Japan. Japanese tend to stay put in their jobs. But 
when Wally sees an opportunity somewhere else, to make more money, he takes 
advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
But after 38 years, at 63, he's still an American in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
He grinned, as he gestured toward his Hawaii-born wife, who waited on an 
American tourist at the pearl counter. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got fired from my last managing job last year, I was ready to finally 
go back to Hawaii, to retire," he said. "But Jane's making so much money here 
with this store, we can't leave." 
</P>
<P>
Yonamine's two daughters, Wallis and Amy, run a branch Yonamine pearl-jewelry 
store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
On the busy little Tokyo street, across the street from the Ibis Hotel, the 
small blue sign above the sidewalk says, "Yonamine Pearls." 
</P>
<P>
If there's an American celebrity in Japan, you might find him or her in 
Yonamine's. Nearly every available space on the shop's walls is occupied by 
autographed photos of sports and entertainment figures buying pearls. 
</P>
<P>
Sports visitors have included Pete Rose, Florence Griffith Joyner, Lee Trevino, 
Gary Carter, Carl Yastrzemski, Cal Ripken Jr., Warren Spahn, Lefty Gomez, 
Sparky Anderson, Brooks Robinson and Willie Mays. 
</P>
<P>
Among the non-sports celebrities have been Elizabeth Taylor, Henry Kissinger, 
Isaac Stern, Andre Kostelanetz, Yo-Yo Ma, Brooke Shields and Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
For sure, here's a guy who has come a long way from sleeping on the floor, on 
newspapers, on Japanese trains. Today, when his thoughts drift back to 1951, he 
sees a lonely young American in Japan, with no knowledge of the Japanese 
language or culture, and with no friends. And he wasn't crazy about Japanese 
food, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd eaten Japanese food in Hawaii, but I never liked sashimi (raw fish)," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"So the first couple years I lived here, I ate three huge bowls of rice every 
day, with a couple of raw eggs and Japanese pickles. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got here in 1951, things were really tough in Japan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, this country has a great train system now, but then it was very 
primitive. And baseball teams traveled in third-class cars, and the trains were 
coal-burning steam locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
"When it came time to sleep, we set out newspapers on the floor and lay down. 
In the summer, we had to open the windows for ventilation. So with soot blowing 
in you were black, head to toe, when you got to where you were going. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, the worst trip was Tokyo to Sapporo. It was 25 hours." 
</P>
<P>
It was particularly difficult for a young American in post-war Japan but 
Yonamine said he never complained. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the Japanese way. 
</P>
<P>
Within a season or two, Wally Yonamine had introduced to Japan the American way 
of baseball. And at first, it went over like a lead balloon. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, even today, young athletes have never played football or rugby, so 
they don't know anything about contact sports," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Hawaii, I'd been taught as a kid that when you're the lead baserunner on a 
double-play ball, you knock down that second baseman and break it up. Well, the 
first few times I did that over here, people were shocked. It was something 
that just wasn't done. It was unsportsmanlike. 
</P>
<P>
"So I started getting a lot of 'Yankee Go Home!' yells, and people threw things 
at me. I wasn't a real Japanese, they knew, and that upset some people. It was 
partly that I was a gaijin (foreigner), and partly because of my aggressive 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was also because I was an American, and Japan was occupied by America 
then. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, Japanese fans realize it's just the way Americans play and they accept 
it. But it's still difficult to teach young players how to take out an 
infielder or a catcher -- they just don't know anything about contact. 
</P>
<P>
"When I managed here, I taught an aggressive style of baseball, but Japan-born 
managers and coaches still don't." 
</P>
<P>
Yonamine put another made-in-the-USA stamp on Japanese baseball -- the manner 
in which he handled pitchers. Or tried to. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all U.S. observers of Japanese baseball agree that Japanese teams 
overwork their pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Keough, who has pitched for the Hanshin Tigers for several years, said 
that Japanese pitchers are asked to throw every day. 
</P>
<P>
"Batting averages in Japan sky-rocket late in the season, because all the 
Japanese pitchers are worn out by then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Yonamine: "By August, a Japanese pitcher's fastball starts looking like a 
grapefruit coming in. The day after they pitch here, a Japanese pitcher goes to 
the bullpen and throws maybe a hundred pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one thing about the way they play baseball over here I've never 
understood. When I managed, I told my pitchers not to throw for the two days 
after they pitched, so they'd find a catcher and go somewhere else and throw." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese players nowadays are much bigger than post-war players, Yonamine said, 
but not necessarily as athletic. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese leagues have lately gotten into weight training and the players 
eat better than they used to, so they're bigger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've noticed that the biggest players here don't seem to have the reflexes 
of the smaller players -- they have trouble getting around on fastballs." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't foresee a trend of good Japanese players playing U.S. major league 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"There are eight or 12 pitchers here who could pitch in the U.S., and maybe 
eight or 12 hitters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But unless there's a dramatic change in the dollar-yen exchange, it won't 
happen. See, in Japan, a big high school star is looking at a $400,000 or 
$500,000 bonus just coming out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
"The top-line stars over here make much more than they would in the States." 
</P>
<P>
Yonamine's managing career reached its apex in 1974, when his Chunichi Dragons 
won Japan's World Series. On the wall, the photo shows Yonamine being carried 
off the field, literally on his back, by jubilant fans and players. He appears 
to be laughing at the skies. 
</P>
<P>
In his boyhood, he laughed at the skies, too. And the memory is pulling him 
back, to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
And now, after all this time, he wants to go home again. 
</P>
<P>
Try to imagine Lahaina, Maui, in 1940. Wally Yonamine can remember. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an extremely beautiful, quiet, small place when I was a kid," he said. 
"No one came there then. In those days, you wouldn't see a single face in 
Lahaina you didn't know."

CITO GASTON IS GETTING JOB DONE AS TORONTO MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first 45 years of Clarence (Cito) Gaston's life were conducted 
unobtrusively enough. It's a stretch to recall that he hit .318 for the San 
Diego Padres in 1970, with 29 home runs and 93 runs batted in, and that he made 
his only All-Star team that summer. It's a more distant reach to recollect that 
he played eight more National League seasons -- earning a living and making a 
pension, but ultimately drifting off into the anonymity of baseball card 
collector's heaven and eight years as a hitting instructor. He came to like it 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
Two springs ago, in the roiling wake of The Campanis Affair, Blue Jays General 
Manager Pat Gillick approached Gaston and asked if he would be interested in 
managing. Not the Blue Jays quite yet, but winter ball. It would be an 
apprenticeship, servicing both the Jays' belief that Gaston might make a useful 
manager someday and baseball's fresh demand for minority candidates. No matter, 
Cito Gaston wasn't hot on the idea. His father was ill, his second marriage 
(with two children added to his own two) was just getting its sea legs and life 
as a coach wasn't at all intolerable. So he said no. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he wanted to manage," Gillick said, "but he just didn't know when the 
opportune time was for him to do it. From some of the discussions we had, I 
think Cito was worried about the life expectancy of managers. He knew the 
mortality rate could be pretty high." 
</P>
<P>
Gaston said, "It wasn't something I wanted to try at the time. I didn't need 
it. I don't have that kind of ego." 
</P>
<P>
Cut to 1989. Gaston has become the fourth black manager in baseball history, 
the second (after Frank Robinson) since Al Campanis awkwardly and accidentally 
thrust on baseball the issues of minority competence and opportunity. It is an 
ironic twist on progress, for in a time when others (Bill Robinson, Bobby 
Tolan) have voiced their aspirations and still others (Harry Edwards, chiefly) 
have policed the sport's hiring, the Blue Jays have chosen the most reluctant 
of symbols. A man who has always preferred to stand in the background now 
stands for something. Something alive and current and important. 
</P>
<P>
To say nothing of handling the Blue Jays, who for all their latent talent, have 
at times in the past two seasons seemed dead and outdated and insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
"Cito's in a tough situation," Jays veteran catcher Ernie Whitt said. "It's 
hard enough to come in and take a last-place club and turn it around. But he's 
a minority, too, and the microscope is always going to be on him, on every move 
he makes. It's unfortunate that's the case, but that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
For instance: The announcement that Gaston, interim manager since Jimy Williams 
was fired on May 15, would be the permanent manager was made on May 31, when 
the Jays were in Toronto. They returned to Toronto last Monday, to a crush of 
450 media members. They were there principally for the opening of the SkyDome, 
but as long as Gaston was there and he the fourth black manager in baseball 
history . . . So Gaston was inundated. "That part," he said, "has been a little 
more than I expected. That will calm down." 
</P>
<P>
He is a pleasant man, with a deliberate, resonant voice, tinged with remnants 
of a twang from his native Texas. The uniform still fits him in most places (in 
many more than, say, Don Zimmer's does) and if the job isn't quite so snug, 
he'll give it time. Patience is one of his virtues, so he understands the 
madness of representing his race and saving his team all in the first two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Campanis thing happened," Gaston said, "organizations -- this one 
has always been good -- started to go out and hire minorities. But nobody's 
going to force anybody to do something they don't want to do, because that's 
bad business and this is a business. I want to be judged as a manager." And if 
that opens more doors? "That's fine, too. But in the meantime, I'm just trying 
to give off positive vibes all the time, have a winning attitude every day at 
the ballpark. If we lose, we'll get them tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gaston's humility could grow from the manner in which the Blue Jays 
conducted their search. After Williams was fired and Gaston was named interim 
manager, Gillick said it was "99% certain" Gaston's appointment would not be 
made permanent. When Bobby Cox left after the 1985 season, the Jays stayed 
within the system by hiring Williams, their third-base coach, to replace him. 
That decision had eventually produced a team in turmoil and in last place in 
the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
"Not that it was Jimy's fault," center fielder Lloyd Moseby said. "We just 
didn't play for Jimy. We didn't make him a great manager." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Jays didn't plan to test the in-house theory again with Gaston. They 
went after Lou Piniella in a big way, but refused to meet George Steinbrenner's 
demand for a starting pitcher in return for letting Piniella out of his 
contract. White Sox coach Terry Bevington was considered, along with Bob 
Bailor, manager of the Jays' Triple-A team in Syracuse. At least two teams 
reportedly wouldn't let the Jays interview their coaches. So on the last day in 
May, it came back to Gaston, no better than fourth choice. But by then, 
coincidentally, the quiet man had decided he was ready for the job. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays were 13-24 when Williams was fired, 7-7 with Gaston as interim 
manager. They have a winning record since he was named manager for the season. 
"I had always felt it was better for them to go outside, because of what 
happened (with Williams)," Gaston said. "But as time went on, I just found it 
to be a challenge. A lot of us have been here for a long time, trying to take 
this thing all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Gillick is still terse on the matter. "Piniella is the guy we really wanted," 
he said. "But we saw that whole deal fall apart. So we've got this hot seat and 
nobody seems to really want it. So we felt we needed somebody who knows the 
players. Cito does. He can't worry about whether he's our second or third 
choice or whatever. He's our manager." 
</P>
<P>
At least until the end of the season, which is as long as his contract runs. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth inning of last Wednesday's 4-2 victory over the Brewers, Jays 
pitcher John Cerutti lost his shutout on a two-run homer by Rob Deer. He struck 
out Greg Brock for the second out of the inning, but then gave up consecutive 
singles to Charlie O'Brien and Mike Felder. Gaston walked out to talk to 
Cerutti. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked me how I was," Cerutti said. "I told him I was fine." 
</P>
<P>
With the tying run on first base and the Jays suddenly facing the possibility 
of going oh-for-Dome in the first series in their $500-million stadium, Gaston 
left Cerutti in. Why? "I wanted him to get the complete game," Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he also wanted to rest his bullpen, which has been hammered of late. But 
that's not the point. By leaving Cerutti in and letting him finish his game 
(which he did, for only the fifth time in his five-year career), Gaston put his 
signature on the game. He will be a players' coach. Hitting instructors are 
often the players' confidants, a buffer between the manager and his personnel 
problems. Gaston was tight with many of the Jays and that was a concern in 
hiring him. 
</P>
<P>
"It still is," Gillick said. 
</P>
<P>
But the alternative -- a man like Williams -- had failed terrifically. Williams 
was largely uncommunicative and irreversibly at odds with temperamental slugger 
George Bell. "When Jimy was here, it seemed to be uptight all the time," 
pitcher Jimmy Key said. "Jimy tried to shut himself off from the players all 
the time. Cito's with them." 
</P>
<P>
Gaston said, "I'm close to the players, sure I am. But I'm close enough to know 
that if I have to do something that's a little different, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
He has assumed a franchise in a state of flux. The chassis of a team that won 
99 games and a division championship in 1985 remains. But the engine has 
slowed: They lost their last six games to blow the division in '87 and last 
year only a cosmetic 22-7 finish got them 12 games over .500 and within two 
games of the Red Sox. Moreover the SkyDome, with its deep power alleys and 
heavy air (when the roof is opened) is showing early signs of being a pitcher's 
park. Gaston must subtly alter his team -- which relied much on long balls in 
Exhibition Stadium -- to squeeze any last success from this generation of Blue 
Jays. 
</P>
<P>
"To me," pitcher Jimmy Key said, "this team is not as strong as the one Jimy 
Williams took over. But it doesn't need to be totally rebuilt and it's not a 
club that can't win." Especially in the woeful American League East. Some of 
the Jays' re-tooling will be visible (Bell and Moseby have been offered in 
trades); but much will be manipulative. 
</P>
<P>
"This team's got talent," Whitt said. "But it hasn't gone out on the field and 
proved it. You've heard of underachievers and overachievers. We're looking for 
some overachievers." 
</P>
<P>
So start with Cito Gaston, The Coincidental Manager. Pushing through his placid 
softness is a knowing pause. Life is different, now. 
</P>
<P>
"I get here earlier," he said, scanning the Dome, "and I stay later."

NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS SIGN GOALIE, GET DEFENSEMAN WITH FIRST PICK 
</P>

<P>
The Kings stunned Minnesota fans who came to the Met Center to watch the 
National Hockey League draft Saturday by announcing the signing of University 
of Minnesota goalie Robb Stauber to a multi-year contract shortly before the 
selection process started. 
</P>
<P>
The last Minnesota fans heard, Stauber had said he would return for his senior 
season with the Golden Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
But it seems that he had a change of heart when King owner Bruce McNall joined 
General Manager Rogie Vachon in negotiations with him late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really do or say anything that made a difference, I don't think," 
McNall said. "I think maybe the fact I was there made them think it was the 
time for no more games." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had another surprise even before the draft got under way when they 
announced the acquisition of veteran right wing Keith Crowder from the Boston 
Bruins as a free agent without compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Stauber and Crowder will figure into the Kings' immediate plans, so they 
upstaged the Kings' pick of Brent Thompson as their first draft choice. 
Thompson was the 39th choice overall when the Kings drafted near the end of the 
second round. He is expected to play two more years of major junior hockey in 
Medicine Hat, Canada, and, possibly, a year at the Kings' New Haven, Conn., 
affiliate before moving up to provide the Kings with much-needed help as a big, 
strong defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings lost their first-round choice, along with first-round picks in 1991 
and 1993, when they completed the Wayne Gretzky deal with the Edmonton Oilers. 
Saturday morning, Edmonton traded that pick to the New Jersey Devils for Corey 
Foster, a 1988 first-round selection. New Jersey selected center Jason Miller 
of Medicine Hat. 
</P>
<P>
The league's No. 1 pick belonged to the Quebec Nordiques, who, as expected, 
drafted Swedish star Mats Sundin, a 6-foot-3 1/2, 187-pound right wing from 
Sollentuna, a suburb of Stockholm. He still has military time to serve and also 
has two years left on a contract with Swedish Elite League champion 
Djurgardens. But he is a formidable offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
Sundin became the NHL's first European player to be chosen No. 1. Pierre 
Gauthier, head scout for the Nordiques, said: "'We just couldn't let the 
opportunity to pick such a good player pass by. Mats Sundin has the potential 
to become a superstar in the National Hockey League. . . . His personality and 
his character led us to invest in that player for the future of our 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Islanders used the next pick to choose left wing Dave Chyzowski, 
and the Toronto Maple Leafs then used the first of their three first-round 
selections to take center Scott Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
The Winnipeg Jets chose center Stu Barnes at No. 4, New Jersey made right wing 
Bill Guerin of Wilbraham, Mass., the first American drafted, and the Chicago 
Blackhawks made 6-4, 206-pound Adam Bennett the first defenseman selected. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota North Stars surprisingly passed on Czechoslovakian star Robert 
Holik in favor of Doug Zmolek, a Rochester (Minn.) High School star who will be 
attending the University of Minnesota this fall. Zmolek was projected as a 
second- or third-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
That announcement, too, had the fans at the Met Center murmuring. 
</P>
<P>
Stauber, property of the Kings since the 1986 draft, had indicated that he 
would return for his senior season. Stauber won the Hobey Baker Award as the 
country's best college player in 1987-88 and finished last season with a record 
of 26-8 and a goals-against-average of 2.43. 
</P>
<P>
Stauber said that he was not influenced by the $1.2-million contract signed 
Friday by his Western Collegiate Hockey Assn. rival at the University of 
Wisconsin, goalie Curtis Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt like it was the best time for me," Stauber said. 
</P>
<P>
Stauber played in the 1986 U.S. Olympic Festival and has expressed a desire to 
play in the Olympics. Asked if he had given up that dream by turning pro, 
Stauber noted how Olympic rules have been relaxed lately and added: "You can 
always plan your retirement to be able to play in the Olympics. Just because 
you're old doesn't mean you can't play." 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 21, he's the youngest on a long list of King goalies. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Hrudey shapes up as the starter, backed by either Mario Gosselin 
(formerly of the Nordiques and recently signed as a free agent) or Stauber. It 
is looking more unlikely that the Kings will sign Glenn Healy, who is a free 
agent without compensation. Healy, the Kings' starter through most of last 
season, won 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Janecyk retired from the New Haven club late last season, but Rollie 
Melanson is still with the Kings. He has been offered a termination contract, 
so he is a free agent without compensation until the end of the month, when the 
Kings will be able to sign him to that contract or buy him out. 
</P>
<P>
"We signed Gosselin to be on the safe side," Vachon said. "Realistically, we 
didn't think the kid (Stauber) wanted to come out." 
</P>
<P>
But Vachon believes that "you need at least five goalies in your organization." 
</P>
<P>
In characterizing Stauber, Vachon said: "He's a stand-up goalie who handles the 
puck like Hrudey. He moves well laterally. I think he has a superb style to 
play in the National Hockey League." 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Tom Webster said the goalie competition will be good. He also said 
Stauber might be able to challenge Gosselin for the backup spot in Los Angeles 
or might best serve his career by spending time in New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
Crowder, 30, has played all nine of his NHL seasons with the Bruins and was a 
teammate of Vachon. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a kid, and I was at the end of my career," Vachon said. 
</P>
<P>
Vachon likened Crowder to John Tonelli, saying that he plays with a lot of 
heart. Last season, Crowder had 15 goals and 18 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' head scout, Bob Owen, was high on Thompson, particularly because the 
Kings put a priority on big defensemen. Thompson is 6-2 1/2, 175 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a defensive-minded defenseman, a stay-at-home, defender-of-the-fortress 
type," Owen said. "He's a salt-of-the-earth kind of guy who's willing to play a 
quiet role, work hard, move the puck out of his end, play physical." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings did not have a pick in the third round. They used their fourth-round 
selection to take Jim Maher, a 6-1, 210-pound defenseman who is a freshman at 
the University of Illinois Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth round, the Kings picked yet another defenseman, 6-4, 230-pound 
Eric Richard, before trading minor leaguer Alan May to Washington for the 
Capitals' fifth-round pick. They used that selection to draft goalie Tom 
Newman, a senior at Blaine (Minn.) High School who will be a freshman at the 
University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
So, once again, the Kings own the rights to a University of Minnesota goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall of the Kings spent much of the day telling reporters that he 
had no plans to sell the American Hockey League affiliate at New Haven as 
rumors persisted that the Kings would sell New Haven and establish a team in 
Phoenix. . . . Representatives from Milwaukee and San Jose were on the scene, 
reminding everyone in the NHL contingent that they are among the leading cities 
to keep in mind for expansion. . . . The Kings' top draft pick, Brent Thompson, 
is from Calgary. Their top pick two years ago was also a defenseman from 
Calgary -- Wayne McBean, since traded to the Islanders. . . . Funny how some of 
the top picks bomb and some later picks soar. Luc Robitaille, for example, was 
a ninth-round pick in 1984 and the Calder Trophy winner the next year. The 
Kings' fourth-round pick in 1984? Tom Glavine. He's pitching for the Atlanta 
Braves. . . . Robitaille's name continues to pop up in trade rumors and McNall 
continues to deny them. "That's how it goes," McNall said. "For a while, all 
the rumors involved Bernie (Nicholls). Now it's Luc."

It wasn't easy, but Cathy Hearn was doing her best to explain to a puzzled 
newcomer how she manages to stay among the top whitewater kayakers in the 
world, even though she's moved from the suburbs of Washington to rural 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
"Look," she finally said in gentle exasperation, "D.C. is the center of the 
paddling universe, okay? But it isn't the paddling universe." 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe you didn't know that here among the monuments in shining marble, the 
stately boulevards, the oppressive summer heat and the mile-high stacks of 
bureaucratic paper, a world-class sporting dynasty lurks. 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't, you'll find out over this weekend and next as the cream of 
international whitewater racing competes in the first world paddling 
championships ever held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Six hundred slalom and wildwater canoeists and kayakers from 25 nations are now 
convened at the rumbling Savage River, a Potomac tributary in Western Maryland, 
for racing that begins Saturday. Few among them failed to make a stop in 
Washington along the way to pay tribute to some of the best in the game. 
</P>
<P>
It's been 10 years now since Hearn, 31, her brother Davey, 30, and suburban 
Washington neighbors Jon Lugbill and Bob Robison rocked the whitewater world 
with a dazzling display of boating virtuosity at the 1979 worlds in Jonquiere, 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Americans were uncontested champions of the paddling world. 
Lugbill, Davey Hearn and Robison swept the top three places in slalom canoe, an 
event no American ever had won before, and Cathy Hearn took three of the four 
gold medals in women's kayak, which no American had won before, either. 
</P>
<P>
In the decade since, Americans in general and Washingtonians in particular have 
set the pace in the fast-changing sport of whitewater slalom, which in 1992 
rejoins the Olympics for the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, for example, Lugbill and Davey Hearn have finished one-two in every 
slalom canoe championship, Lugbill taking four of the five golds in such 
far-flung places as Bourg St. Maurice, France; Bala, Wales; and Merano, Italy, 
to become the top slalom canoeist of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, lured by U.S. successes, top racers from England, Australia, France, 
Italy, New Zealand and elsewhere have migrated to train for weeks and months 
with Washington's elite on a Potomac River practice course just below Little 
Falls, not 10 miles from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Now come the worlds as partial reward. "The International Canoe Federation let 
us know they would look favorably on an American bid after we did so well again 
in 1983," said U.S. slalom team coach Bill Endicott. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the origins of Washington's whitewater phenomenon, it helps to 
know a bit about the nation's capital, its remarkable river and the highly 
motivated people it attracts. 
</P>
<P>
Endicott, for example, moved to town in the mid-1970s, fresh from a graduate 
degree at Harvard, with an ambition to fix some of the nation's social ills. He 
worked a while as a congressman's aide, then on the prestigious Democratic 
Study Group. 
</P>
<P>
But as an ex-whitewater paddler and Harvard oarsman, he couldn't help noticing 
the beautiful river cascading through his adopted city. Before long, he was out 
playing on Potomac whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
There he ran into Lugbill, the Hearns and a host of other local youngsters, all 
fired up about racing after Silver Spring, Md.'s Jamie McEwan won a bronze 
medal in slalom canoe in the 1972 Olympics, the only previous Olympics ever to 
feature the arcane sport. When the youngsters asked Endicott to coach them, he 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few years, Endicott had quit his career to devote full time to 
coaching, living off a modest trust fund and spending mornings and evenings 
hounding his charges up and down the Potomac with a stopwatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill wound up the perfect coach," said Cathy Hearn. "He provided organization, 
objectivity and helped the overall attitude of the group, but he didn't try to 
tell us what to do. 
</P>
<P>
"But the most valuable thing," she said, "was that he was a tireless, fanatical 
worker. Here was this volunteer killing himself for us. What were we going to 
do in return for him? The feeling was, we'd better deliver." 
</P>
<P>
And they did. In 1977, Robison, then 15, was fourth in slalom canoe at the 
world championships in Spittall, Austria. The Washington-based, two-man canoe 
team of Steve and Mike Garvis also took fourth and Cathy Hearn won a bronze 
medal in the women's kayak team race. 
</P>
<P>
That should have been fair warning to the world, but no one, not even the 
Americans, was prepared for the 1979 tour de force, which signaled the start of 
U.S. domination in a sport practically no one in the nation had even competed 
in before 1957. 
</P>
<P>
By 1981, decked canoes designed by Lugbill, Robison and Davey Hearn were the 
standard for the world, as they are today, and slalom paddling and 
boat-handling techniques the trio devised were miles ahead of anyone else's, as 
they also remain. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 18 years old when I won the world championship for the first time," said 
Lugbill, shaking his head in wonder during a lunch-hour break from his job as 
Potomac River water quality analyst for the metropolitan Washington Council of 
Governments. "That's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Far more remarkable is the fact he remains world champion a decade later, with 
no one on the horizon except perennial Washington, D.C., rival Hearn and recent 
Washington transplant Jed Prentice even remotely likely to overtake him. 
</P>
<P>
Washingtonians have redefined whitewater slalom canoeing. To understand how 
requires a little background on the sport itself. 
</P>
<P>
Whitewater river-running underwent a sea change in the early 1960s with the 
advent of fiberglass boats. Before then, runs through rapids were hair-raising 
affairs in heavy, open, aluminum or wooden boats or folding, canvas-covered 
kayaks that needed patching after every run. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic provided a light, durable, cheap, easily repairable alternative. 
Suddenly, rampaging rivers that had been the province of daredevils and fools 
were approachable by the masses. 
</P>
<P>
A busy racing schedule evolved, with races following two forms. Slalom 
competitors ran 600-yard courses through 25 gates strung in the toughest 
places, with penalties if they touched the gatepoles; wildwater racers went 
five miles or so in a straight shot downriver with no gates, like downhill ski 
racers. 
</P>
<P>
Both disciplines flowered in Europe, where world whitewater championships had 
been held since 1949, but developed more slowly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
McEwan's charge to Olympic bronze in 1972 changed that. "We were out on a 
geological expedition that summer," said Cathy Hearn, "and when we heard the 
news on the radio, I remember saying, 'That's for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Washington, with the largest canoe club in the nation, the 2,000-member Canoe 
Cruisers Association, was just the place for the movement to take hold. And the 
new interest in paddling corresponded to a time of dramatically improving river 
quality as President Lyndon B. Johnson's mid-1960s pledge to make the Potomac 
swimmable began taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
The young Hearns found themselves increasingly headed to the river, where they 
bumped into Lugbill and his brother Ron; Robison; the Garvises; Lecky and Fritz 
Haller; Chris, Mike and Mark McCormick and a host of other would-be world 
beaters. 
</P>
<P>
In the rebellious days of the early '70s, "Our attitude was whatever had been 
done in the past, we weren't going to do," said Lugbill. "Anything that was 
status quo we changed." 
</P>
<P>
Lugbill and Robison became known for their frenetic paddling style, directly 
contrary to European traditions of smoothness and technique. The pair were 
comical figures on the river, crashing and flipping and running out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Lugbill, Robison and Davey Hearn spent their spare time rubbishing 
old boat designs in an effort to shape a better hull. Conventional slalom 
canoes were too big, they decided, so they sawed a smaller kayak in half, 
expanded it to make it legal canoe size, and laid up a decked canoe in its 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters discovered that the sleeker, smaller boat made it possible to 
sneak under slalom gates sideways. That was much faster, and as they perfected 
techniques, Robison accidentally invented the quick "pivot turn" now favored by 
all slalom racers. 
</P>
<P>
Robison demonstrated his pivot to slack-jawed European competitors at the 1979 
worlds. For them, the American nightmare had begun, and old-school European 
slalom canoeists haven't fully recovered yet. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Europeans will win their share of medals on the Savage. The U.S. 
grip has slackened as the best American paddlers aged. Cathy Hearn is a long 
shot, at best, to win a medal this year; after several bouts of shoulder 
trouble, she's only the second-best U.S. women's kayaker behind Dartmouth 
graduate Dana Chladek, who moved to Washington to train two years ago. David 
Hearn at 30 is beginning to suffer aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
The British have a stranglehold on men's and women's slalom kayak events, with 
three-time gold medalist Richard Fox a near lock in the men's division and 
countrymate Liz Sharman the favorite on the women's side. 
</P>
<P>
Americans never have dominated wildwater competition, which remains largely the 
province of Eastern Europeans, and in fact the United States has not taken 
overall national honors at the worlds since 1981, although it's been a strong 
second each year. 
</P>
<P>
But there will be special advantages for the Americans in having the event in 
their own backyard, while Soviets, Czechs, Aussies, French and New Zealanders 
wrestle with the cultural and social discombobulations the Americans long have 
endured overseas. 
</P>
<P>
But the voyage to Maryland's most rural county, with just 25,000 inhabitants 
and millions of trees, should be pleasant enough for foreigners. They'll enjoy 
the best whitewater racing stretch in the east. 
</P>
<P>
At night, the visitors may gaze upon a starlit summer sky, its brilliance 
undiminished by urban haze. And on the way home, they can always stop in 
Washington for a last glimpse of the paddling universe from the other side. 
</P>
<P>
From the center, looking out.

HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO MAKE A DECISION?

<P>
Most, if not all, of the boxing writers sitting near me at ringside last Monday 
night at Caesars Palace scored the Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns fight for 
Hearns. The range was two to four points. I had Hearns, 114-112. 
</P>
<P>
It was an exciting fight, and certainly a more intense fight than I had 
expected to see. Based on what Hearns had looked like in his three previous 
bouts, I expected that Leonard would stop him in the early rounds. 
</P>
<P>
So I was surprised that this one went the distance. And even though my score 
card had Hearns ahead by two points -- even after a 10-8 12th round for Leonard 
-- I wouldn't have beefed if the judges had given it to Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
I do have a beef with the result, however -- a draw. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in 14 months, the Nevada Athletic Commission has called a 
major championship fight in Las Vegas a draw. In other words, after 12 rounds, 
hundreds of punches thrown and two knockdowns, we are asked to believe that it 
was not possible to determine a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for professional boxing to rid itself of draws. A dead heat in a 
boxing match is physiologically and mathematically impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Rolly Schwartz has been in amateur boxing for more than 50 years. He was the 
team manager of the 1976 Olympic team, Sugar Ray Leonard's team, and now 
coaches Xavier University and Golden Gloves boxers in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz says he can't remember when amateur boxing got rid of draws, but says 
it happened long before he got into the sport. In other words, it's possible 
that pro boxing is 100 years behind the amateurs in this area. 
</P>
<P>
"Judges in the amateurs score bouts even on points all the time," Schwartz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is, there're three backup criteria a judge must go to if he's 
scored a bout even. The first one is, which boxer was the most effective 
aggressor? If that's also even, then the second factor is, which boxer 
demonstrated the best style? If that's even, the third factor is, which boxer 
showed the best defense? The point is, the judge must designate a winner. All 
you need is backup criteria." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Hazard, executive director of the New Jersey Athletic Commission, says 
another possible way to eliminate draws is for a judge who calls a fight even 
on points to award victory to the boxer who was the stronger finisher. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that fair? I don't know, but we need to talk about ways to get around 
draws," he said. "What about overall ring generalship? What about defense? 
There are some added criteria judges could look at. I am not, however, in favor 
of asking the fighters to go an extra round." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, two judges scored one-point margins for Leonard and Hearns. The 
third, Dalby Shirley, called it even. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen months ago, at the Las Vegas Hilton, two judges split over Marlon 
Starling and Mark Breland. A third, Elias Quintana, called it even. In 1983, 
also in Las Vegas, Michael Dokes and Mike Weaver fought a 15-round draw. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Jerry Nathanson, a California Athletic Commission member and an 
outspoken opponent of draws, said he was a vote or two away from banning boxing 
draws in California. He's apparently lost support, however, and says he has 
given up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, there will be more draws in championship fights. Count on it. Chuck 
Minker, the Nevada Athletic Commission's executive director, said he was 
untroubled by the Leonard-Hearns draw, and Commissioner Duane Ford said much 
the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Judges look at each round as a (separate) fight," Ford said. "And most don't 
keep a running score. If at the end, it comes out even, then that's how it is. 
If three judgescan't agree, then a draw is a good decision. What's the 
alternative, flipping a coin? Drawing straws?" 
</P>
<P>
No, Duane. Just give your judges a little more ammunition, so they can earn the 
money for the task you're paying them to do -- to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>

CHALLENGERS TO LINE UP AND WAIT FOR SUGAR RAY 
</P>

<P>
Among the spectators seated at ringside for Monday night's rematch between 
Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns was Chuck Daly. The man was enjoying a 
night off from his job as coach of the Detroit Pistons. His team was in Los 
Angeles, awaiting the fourth game of their National Basketball Association 
championship series against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Daly felt confident in the Pistons' 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven 
series if he chose to watch the World Boxing Council super-middleweight title 
bout instead of basketball tapes. But the man suggested he was merely on a 
scouting mission. "I'm looking," he said, "for a knockout punch." 
</P>
<P>
Although both Hearns and Leonard still were looking for the elusive weapon at 
the conclusion of their 12-round bout, apparently Daly found what he came for. 
The Pistons terminated their series in the minimum four games the following 
night, annexing their first championship since they represented Fort Wayne, 
Ind., in the old National Basketball League four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Daly had such heavyweight bangers as Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn while 
the Lakers, much like Leonard, competed without their usual touch of Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Daly was not overlooked in the introduction of celebrities attending the fight 
in the outdoor stadium behind Caesars Palace. Indeed, his name was second on 
the list. The predominantly pro-Lakers (or anti-Bad Boys) crowd dutifully 
booed. But the reaction was mild in comparison to that accorded another 
prominent person seemingly out of his element. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jerry Falwell, in town for the Southern Baptist convention, was 
roundly jeered for his appearance in the VIP section. Only the previous day, 
Falwell had announced he was disbanding the Moral Majority, a 
religious-oriented political action group he had founded. Boxing, however, 
tends to attract the amoral minority, especially when held in such lavish 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few years back, a full house at Caesars welcomed with applause a man in 
a wheelchair identified by the public address announcer as "The Honorable Larry 
Flynt." 
</P>
<P>
The precise source of his honor wasn't explained. But fight fans can be tough 
on outsiders who anger them. Thousands in the Atlantic City Convention Center 
booed Robin Givens before the start of the heavyweight championship fight 
between Mike Tyson, her husband at the time, and Michael Spinks. They were at 
least as unforgiving of George Steinbrenner, who was not present to hear his 
name verbally trashed. 
</P>
<P>
What lent a melancholy aspect to the whole affair was the presence of so many 
boxers who shaped the sport in the 1980s. The decade was running down and so 
were Leonard, Hearns and Roberto Duran, the Panamanian warhorse who has a score 
to settle with Leonard, preferably in the context of a million-dollar 
extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
"The old triangle," noted Marvelous Marvin Hagler, leaving himself out of the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
But Hagler was very much on display, just as promoter Bob Arum intended when he 
tapped the former middleweight champion and Duran as broadcast analysts. 
Leonard, of course, was the key if the seniors were to continue their lucrative 
round-robin series. "I want to fight Leonard, nobody else," Duran said in 
advance of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Sutton had a similar regard for banks. In the current state of boxing, 
Leonard is the key to the treasury. At least, he was. Hagler said his head 
tells him not to return to the ring but admitted his body is in shape and his 
heart still wants to fight. He said he was happy with his career, yet sad about 
the way it ended. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the draw and Leonard's hesitation in deciding his future, 
however, new plans were being hastily drawn. Hearns wants to continue boxing, 
against the advice of manager Emanuel Steward. 
</P>
<P>
Arum determined a fight between Hearns and undefeated middleweight sensation 
Michael Nunn would be a natural. "Of course, Bob Arum would say that," Hearns 
responded. "He's a promoter." 
</P>
<P>
Hearns said a second fight with Hagler would be "meaningful" to him, but it 
might be something less to Hagler and to the public. Meanwhile, Duran wanted no 
part of Nunn, either. "Let (Iran) Barkley fight Nunn," he said, gesturing in 
the direction of the man he beat in 12 furious rounds to win the WBC 
middleweight title and regain his credibility. 
</P>
<P>
At the morning-after news conference, a man mentioned that Nunn claimed he 
could have knocked out both Leonard and Hearns on the basis of the previous 
night's exercise. "He's right," Leonard said cryptically, dismissing the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Nunn was correct in his assumption. But the next move remains up to 
Leonard, despite the most disappointing performance of his career. A 
potentially lucrative third match against Hearns is the first option for Arum, 
thanks to a decision that failed to satisfy even Dalby Shirley, the judge who 
scored the fight exactly even. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard has been in a similar position before. He has made Hearns wait on two 
previous occasions. He made Hagler wait. And now an entire troupe of 
gladiators, all stars of the '80s, awaits Sugar Ray's pleasure. Don't think for 
a moment he's not enjoying the situation even as he contemplates his own 
decline.

SWIM MEET OF CHAMPIONS; 
</P>
<P>
JAGER BATTLES AGE-OLD ISSUE, AND WINS 50 FREESTYLE 
</P>

<P>
Tom Jager, a silver medalist in the Seoul Olympics, said he wants to prove that 
older swimmers can compete in a sport dominated by youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, 24, who works as an aquatics director in Albuquerque, N.M., showed 
Saturday that he is fast enough to win major competitions with a victory in the 
50-meter freestyle during the third day of the International Swim Meet of 
Champions at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, who was edged by Matt Biondi for the gold medal in the 1988 Olympic 50, 
was clocked in 23.74 seconds. Brian Kurza of UCLA finished second in 24.15 and 
Brian Jacobson, 15, of the Bellflower Aquatic Club was third in 24.35. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have scrambled a bit much in my race, and that might have slowed me down 
a bit," said Jager, whose 23.60 was the top qualifying time in Saturday 
morning's preliminaries. Jager, who wants to break Biondi's world record of 
22.14 set during the Seoul Games, said he decided to continue competing to 
serve as a role model for younger competitors as well as help find ways for 
athletes to stay in the sport after they complete their college careers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot still needs to be done in the sport," Jager said. "United States 
Swimming (the sport's governing body in the United States) needs to take better 
care of our athletes than they are doing now so we can continue to train and 
stay in the sport after they complete college." 
</P>
<P>
Still a teen-ager, Janet Evans of Placentia need only worry about winning, 
which she did twice Saturday. Evans, the world-record holder in the 400-meter 
freestyle, won that event in 4:13.55. 
</P>
<P>
France's Laurence Bensimon finished second in 4:19.65 and Francie O'Leary of 
the Click Tucson Swim Club was third in 4:19.65. 
</P>
<P>
Evans held off Mission Viejo High School senior Suzi Burt to win the 200 
backstroke in 2:18.53. Burt, who stayed with Evans during the first half of the 
race, ns was second in 2:22.27, and Natalie Norberg of Industry Hills was third 
in 2:23.51. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good," said Evans, who won the 400-meter individual medley but 
finished fourth in the 200 butterfly Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400-meter freestyle, Poland's Artur Wojdat scored his third 
victory of the meet by edging 1988 U.S. Olympian Dan Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat, who battled with Jorgensen for the lead for most of the race, had a 
strong last 100 meters to win. Wojdat was timed in 3:55.09, Jorgensen 3:56.63. 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat's fellow Pole and Mission Viejo Nadadore swim club teammate Mariusz 
Podkoscielny was third in 3:57.77, and Jorgensen's younger brother, Lars, was 
fourth in 4:00.80.

WORLD CUP QUALIFYING;

<P>
U.S. BOUNCES BACK TO BEAT GUATEMALA, 2-1 
</P>

<P>
David Vanole, the U.S. goalkeeper, was not certain afterward whether he saw the 
ball coming toward him. He did know that it bounced off his knee and away from 
the goal, sparing the United States the embarrassment of another tie at home in 
a World Cup soccer qualifying game. 
</P>
<P>
It is such a slim difference, that between triumph and despair. 
</P>
<P>
Vanole felt the latter in the United States' last qualifying game at Torrance 
in May, when Trinidad and Tobago scored with two minutes remaining for a 1-1 
tie. He accepted blame for the goal, even though it was not entirely his fault. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in fairness to himself, Vanole, who is from Manhattan Beach, should have 
accepted credit for the crucial defensive play Saturday at Veterans Memorial 
Stadium that preserved the United States' 2-1 victory over Guatemala. Instead, 
he called it luck. But that did not make him any less ecstatic. By any other 
name, a victory is still a victory. 
</P>
<P>
The game was saved with less than 13 minutes remaining, when Guatemala's Edwin 
Westphal right-footed a line drive toward the goal from about seven yards away. 
It might have been a difficult play for Vanole even if he had seen it. Because 
he did not, it probably was fortunate that his right knee got in the way. 
</P>
<P>
The ball bounced in front of the goal to Guatemala's Adan Paniagua, who headed 
it back toward Vanole. But he followed that one all the way to end Guatemala's 
last serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
"The initial save was luck," Vanole said. "But give me credit for being in the 
right position. I've got to take credit for something." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was considered necessary for the United States in its attempt to 
qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1950. In a five-team 
qualifying tournament of teams from North America, Central America and the 
Caribbean, the two teams with the best records at the end of the year will 
advance to the 1990 World Cup in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The United States had a 1-1-1 record before Saturday, but only two of its 
remaining five games were at home. So the U.S. players must have been dismayed 
to discover when they arrived here that about one-third of the 10,561 fans were 
cheering for Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
"We had more fans, but they had louder fans," Vanole said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States took the Guatemalan fans out of the game a little more than 
two minutes into it when forward Bruce Murray of Germantown, Md., scored on a 
perfect pass from the right corner by John Harkes of Kearney, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"John should take all the credit," said Murray, who could not capitalize on two 
other scoring opportunities early in the game. "It was an impossible angle, but 
he made it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes later, the Guatemalan fans finally had reason to cheer when 
their exciting young star, Juan Manuel Funes, passed to the right wing to Raul 
Chacon, whose shot caught Vanole out of position and bounced off the left 
corner post for a goal. 
</P>
<P>
The United States scored the winning goal 22 minutes into the 45-minute second 
half, when Eric Eichmann of Margate, Fla., took a header from Steve Trittschuh 
of Granite City, Ill., and kicked it toward the goal from 10 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was headed back out by Alejandro Ortiz, but it bounced off the 
shoulder of teammate Felix McDonald and went back into the goal. The official 
scorer ruled that Ortiz was behind the goal line when he made the defensive 
play. So it was Eichmann's goal. But it would have counted for the United 
States either way. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala probably lost its last chance to rally when Funes was sent to the 
sideline for punching Harkes, forcing the visitors to play a man short for the 
last five minutes.

THE CONTROVERSY AT WARD CREEK; 
</P>
<P>
HYDROELECTRIC PLANT SPARKS ANGRY REACTION FROM RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
TAYLORSVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Rosebush frets on the porch of his rustic house, leafing through legal 
documents and swatting mosquitoes. The mosquitoes are a minor annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a small hydroelectric plant sits behind locked gates on Ward Creek, 
which flows through a forest, down a mountain and through the meadows of 
Genesee Valley, a remote northeastern California community of about 50 rancher 
and retiree families. 
</P>
<P>
Many feel violated by what Five Bears Hydro, Inc., has done to their valley. 
It's too big to swat away, and it isn't hard to find. Just follow the power 
poles and lines that weren't there yesteryear and look for the scar 20 yards 
wide down the mountain, which the developers needed for a 20-inch-diameter pipe 
to divert water from trout to turbine. 
</P>
<P>
The power poles, residents say, were supposed to be underground or out of 
sight. They aren't. 
</P>
<P>
The trout, the California Department of Fish and Game says, were supposed to 
have been protected during the construction. About a thousand were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kossow, a U.S. Forest Service worker, said: "The worst part was their 
trying to hide it." 
</P>
<P>
One resident, Elisa Adler, said: "Ward Creek was once considered the best 
fishing stream in Plumas County." 
</P>
<P>
Rosebush, a logger, said: "I've got pictures of two fish my brother caught in 
'85 -- a two-pound brown and a three-pound rainbow. I walked my brothers down 
to the creek last year and they were real disappointed. It's probably not even 
going to be worth fishing." 
</P>
<P>
The project -- not yet operating -- was conceived in 1981 by Ed McDowell, who 
had been a resident logger since the '50s but was looking for another source of 
income during one of the recurring slumps in the timber business. Five Bears 
was named for five old quartz mines -- Brown, Polar, Cinnamon, Grizzly and Bear 
-- on land McDowell bought in 1979. It was planned to pay back its $400,000 
construction cost in only three years. 
</P>
<P>
Later, McDowell, short of capital, sold his permits from the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission to Developpement, Innovation, Transfert de Technologie, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Electricite de France. 
</P>
<P>
His son Bruce, a former football player at Sacramento State, stayed on to work 
for DITT, but soon the project turned sour. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Meinz, a DFG biologist, said he visited the site last August to check a 
report that a cement truck had dumped more than a cubic yard of concrete mix 
into the stream. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard about it from another contractor (for) another power project," Meinz 
said. "He started complaining about what was going on at Five Bears. 
Apparently, they were trying to keep it quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Game Warden Bill Peters said: "I counted 537 dead rainbow trout." 
</P>
<P>
Nine months earlier, there had been a similar accident, in which about 400 
trout died. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Mensch, environmental services supervisor for the DFG, looked over the 
situation. His office deals with hydro projects that affect fisheries in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"We observed dead trout as large as 12 inches," Mensch said. "It's all native 
trout production, and it appeared to have an outstanding population." 
</P>
<P>
Plumas County is, in effect, a small town of 18,000. It's hard to keep anything 
a secret for long. After hours, the project workers would gather at the 
Taylorsville Tavern, about four miles away, and talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was on the verge of . . . mutiny," Meinz said. "The workers were 
quite upset about that whole project. We started getting calls." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those calls concerned a spill of diesel fuel, possibly contaminating 
the ground water and, indirectly, the stream. Although jobs are scarce in the 
area, some workers quit. 
</P>
<P>
Down on the flats, the creek flows through a ranch owned by Brian Kingdon, who 
has cooperated with locals in projects to save the fishery. Late this spring, 
Kingdon waved down Kossow along the road to tell him something. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any little fish out there anywhere," Kingdon said. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion is divided on how good a trout stream Ward Creek was. Too remote and 
under-fished to be stocked by the DFG, it depends upon its native trout to 
reproduce themselves, but Mensch said that silting from the project has damaged 
much of the spawning bed. 
</P>
<P>
To fulfill terms of the FERC permit, DITT had to commission independent 
surveys, using Thomas R. Payne and Associates, Fisheries Consultants, of 
Arcata, Calif. Payne's initial report in 1985 declared "a rough estimate of 
four to five fish per 100 feet of stream . . . a relatively low density for 
typical trout streams," with no fish larger than eight inches seen. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, after the concrete spills, Payne took another look and found 27 
fish, from two to six inches. He sent his report to DITT, whose vice president 
is Robert Treiberg, with headquarters in Grass Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The claim that the trout population was either irrevocably damaged or ruined 
is simply not true," Treiberg wrote to the FERC. 
</P>
<P>
Meinz said, "I don't agree with that at all. If it had been normal, they would 
have got maybe 100 fish instead of 27." 
</P>
<P>
Payne said his survey was conducted in "pretty crummy (weather) conditions . . 
. (and) "our sampling wasn't anything that could really be relied on." 
</P>
<P>
He plans to return late this summer and again next spring. Meanwhile, he is 
skeptical about claims of big fish being caught in Ward Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very small creek," Payne said. "There are probably some eight- or 
10-inch trout occasionally. (Anything bigger), somebody would be dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
Kossow, who was a biologic technician with the DFG until five years ago, said: 
"I agree that the fish were not large . . . not by any means a trophy fishery. 
Just a typical Sierra stream. 
</P>
<P>
"But the lower section is a nursery area. The huge fish come up from the river 
(Indian Creek) to spawn. I've seen 20-inch fish in there." 
</P>
<P>
Who's right? Maybe it doesn't matter. Beyond the debate of how good the fishing 
was, Ward Creek is a symbol of a little bit of paradise lost. 
</P>
<P>
Mensch said: "It's not a devastation of Northern California's fisheries, but we 
consider every one of those streams to play an important part." 
</P>
<P>
Meinz said that otherwise, he has no current complaints with DITT. 
</P>
<P>
"They've done quite a good job in reconstituting what they'd screwed up," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But a larger question is: Was the power plant feasible in the first place? 
Although it has been in place for several months, it has yet to produce a 
kilowatt of juice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's been enough water," McDowell said. "I think it takes (a 
flow of) three cubic feet per second (CFS) to trigger that thing." 
</P>
<P>
A statewide drought is not the problem, residents say. The Genesee Valley has 
had its normal, abundant rainfall this year. 
</P>
<P>
Mensch doubts that the flow in Ward Creek -- about 3 1/2 CFS -- is sufficient 
to maintain a trout population and run a power plant, and that the FERC 
probably shouldn't have issued a license for Five Bears in the first place. By 
DFG and FERC regulations, the fish come first, with guaranteed minimum flows. 
</P>
<P>
"We set what the fish need and make that recommendation to FERC," Mensch said. 
"We hear all the time, 'You're killing my project.' We don't care (about that) 
one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
But because it is so small and remote, Rosebush said, "A lot of people would 
say that Ward Creek isn't worth wasting your time on." 
</P>
<P>
Even Tom Buckwalter, the Plumas County district attorney, seems to agree. 
</P>
<P>
At the instigation of the DFG, Buckwalter filed a complaint on May 20, 1988, 
against the developers, citing 12 violations of the fish and game code. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Millay, assistant planning director for Plumas County, also produced what 
he called "a fairly impressive list of violations" of construction regulations, 
"looking at a hearing for revocation of their special use permit." 
</P>
<P>
But a year later, like the power plant, the complaints just sit there, doing 
nothing. At the county courthouse in Quincy, the wheels turn slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Buckwalter said, "I've only talked to the (DITT) attorney. That's all I've done 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe those are standard misdemeanors, which are six months and/or a 
$1,000 fine. It ranks quite a bit below child molesting, and I've got four of 
those set for trial right now." 
</P>
<P>
Also, because of a precedent set by a similar case in nearby Shasta County, 
there is a question of whether the state and county have any jurisdiction once 
the developer has been granted a license by the FERC. 
</P>
<P>
As for the residents, they seem clearly overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
"Our county is not a rich county," Rosebush said. "We can't go into litigation 
with these billion-dollar corporations." 
</P>
<P>
The fishery aside, some Genesee Valley residents are sickened by the sight of 
the transmission lines through their land. They are underground on land owned 
by the U.S. Forest Service, which demanded it, but out in the open elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Our gripe is that we wanted to protect the scenic quality of this area," 
Rosebush said. "It was laid out in black and white what the scenic corridor 
was. If they have actually tried to mislead the facts -- if FERC will review 
this -- if they determine that they did mislead them and everybody else, they 
should be forced to remove it." 
</P>
<P>
Treiberg, the DITT executive, completed a 1 1/2-inch-thick report for the FERC, 
responding to the complaints, with copies to the DFG and others interested. 
Treiberg would not speak to The Times but forwarded a copy of the report that 
reflects confidence of the company's legal position. 
</P>
<P>
In a 15-page cover letter to the FERC, he said the company misled no one and 
has no intention of changing anything. He dismissed the opponents' proposals as 
"technically infeasible . . . absurd . . . ridiculous or unsound and 
unacceptable," and generally rejected all demands for mitigation. 
</P>
<P>
The scar where the water tube was laid down the mountain will be reforested, 
according to prior agreement, but that's about all. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the DFG, Kossow was hired by DITT to study the fishery but 
abruptly resigned one day during a field trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We stopped for lunch and they were sitting around talking about how they were 
going to 'handle' this certain official and other problems," Kossow said. "I 
finally got up and said, 'You're the most dishonest people I've ever been 
around.' They just manipulate people. That's what bothered me." 
</P>
<P>
Leo and Janey Leyva are ready to throw in the towel. They came to the valley 10 
years ago, believing they had found a humble retirement home in a pristine 
forest wilderness. Now they have one hope left. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to move," Janey Leyva said. "We have done everything conceivably 
possible. I'm politicked up to my eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd had some financial setbacks, and we found this inexpensive, small piece 
of property with a national forest on one side and a ranch on the other. We had 
total privacy, and it was a backwater road. No one ever passed by except for a 
few neighbors. We thought we could stay here until we died." 
</P>
<P>
Looking out into the valley from their covered front porch, one now sees the 
transmission lines planted along the dirt road, which fords Ward Creek a 
hundred yards down. 
</P>
<P>
"We have fought for 10 years to keep this a dirt road, any time anybody tried 
to make it better," Leyva said. "We wanted to keep the dirt road full of 
potholes to keep people out. And now that these (DITT) people are here, they 
have bought the adjacent 30 acres so they can build a bridge across (the 
creek), and once the bridge is built this place is going to be like a house on 
a street." 
</P>
<P>
Treiberg points out that there always were transmission lines -- those planted 
by Pacific Gas and Electric years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That's absolute baloney," Leyva said. "Theirs are just loaded down with all 
this paraphernalia. The PG&amp;E poles are simple little T's with wire strung 
to them. They're not wonderful, but they serve a purpose. They're delivering 
electricity to us. We've learned to live with it. These (new) poles are doing 
absolutely nothing for the community." 
</P>
<P>
Treiberg says the county and the residents had plenty of warning. Five Bears 
and DITT filed all of the proper advance legal notices of intentions and public 
hearings in local publications. 
</P>
<P>
Noel Folsom, the FERC's branch chief in San Francisco, said: "A project is in 
the application stage for at least a year and usually several years. If the 
county wants to object, they have to do it then. Once it's licensed, it's very 
difficult to force the licensee to make any changes." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Hyland, media specialist at the FERC's main office in Washington, said: 
"We are looking at the complaints." 
</P>
<P>
Rosebush and others believe that the county officials, nearly 30 miles away in 
Quincy, let them down -- in fact, were virtually duped when the project was 
subtly changed after initial county approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Out here, we're almost in the position of being our own watchdogs," Rosebush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Leyva said: "We are equally guilty. They print these little public notices in 
the paper in fine print, and who ever reads them? We could have had input at 
some point, but none of us knew the political process. 
</P>
<P>
"They're covered. They know all the ins and outs, and we're a bunch of 
bumpkins." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the residents formed the Alliance for Indian Creek to present a 
unified front. 
</P>
<P>
"It may prevent situations like this from happening in the future, but I think 
it's too late for this," Leyva said. 
</P>
<P>
One future consideration is a much larger project proposed for Red Clover Creek 
at the other end of the valley "with high-tension towers," Leyva said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ward Creek plant is designed to generate only 980 kilowatts. The 
$38.6-million Red Clover project is proposed for 30 megawatts -- more than 30 
times the size. 
</P>
<P>
"You can just forget about living here altogether if they put that one in," 
Leyva said. "I think it's destroyed forever now." 
</P>
<P>
Rosebush said: "There are projects like this happening all over the state, all 
over the country. The feds can't allow big companies like this to take 
advantage of them." 
</P>
<P>
Mensch, the DFG's hydro specialist, said: "I'm not relating it to this project, 
but what we're finding is that the Small Hydro Act provided a real opening for 
entrepreneurs and schemers to come up with new development schemes and obtain 
permits, which they subsequently sold . . . people not necessarily interested 
in energy production but strictly out to make a quick buck. 
</P>
<P>
"These people picked any streams that were steep. Many of them filed dozens of 
applications strictly by looking at a U.S. Geological Survey topo(graphical) 
map . . . never been to the stream, didn't know what was there, just wanted to 
make sure they got it. In those cases we have seen extreme resource damages." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell said he and his son at first intended to build and operate the power 
plant themselves. When they realized they were in over their heads financially, 
they sold their permits and 100 acres to DITT in 1986, and Ed dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
He has lived in the valley for 30 years. His wife Dolores taught school. So it 
bothers him, he said, that "we've had these people that came here a short time 
ago -- street people with street values -- that haven't had to go out in the 
hills and scratch out a living and don't understand what those of us who have 
had to are faced with." 
</P>
<P>
The project did create jobs in the valley and, McDowell said, the opponents 
don't speak for the entire town. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more people down on Rosebush and Leyva," he said. "They all thought 
they should be compensated some way. They look at these trees and don't want to 
change it. Well, we live here and accept a lower standard of living because we 
like it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Kossow said the Alliance for Indian Creek, with 100 to 120 members, is 
representative of the local attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"We speak for the people in Genesee Valley," Kossow said. "(McDowell) has never 
been to a meeting."

Payne, the independent fisheries expert hired by DITT, said: "The power project 
is all above where any fish would be moving up to spawn. If there were fish 
spawning from Indian Creek (into Ward Creek), they'd be in the low gradient 
area down in the meadow, at least a half-mile or so below the power project."

THIS WRITER QUALIFIES AS A 'GOOF' FOR GOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLEL ITALIE, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the golfing world, a "goof" is someone who drives 400 miles just to see a 
particular foursome, who arrives on the green at 6 a.m. to follow Jack 
Nicklaus, who drops everything for a chance to play 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
William Hallberg is a goof. 
</P>
<P>
"I can be in the middle of writing a story, and it could be going beautifully," 
explained Hallberg, 38, an English professor at East Carolina University and 
author of the novel, "Rub of the Green." 
</P>
<P>
"If some friend of mine called me up and said 'Bill, let's go down and play 
this course, I would say, 'Let me finish this paragraph,' that would be my 
rationalization, and off I would go." 
</P>
<P>
He has collected more than 500 golf novels and short stories, dating back to 
the mid-19th century, and raids bookstores around the world looking for more. 
</P>
<P>
On the walls of his home in Greenville, N.C., hang a dozen or so golf paintings 
as well as framed maps of courses. Hallberg is also the proud owner of several 
"hideous" golf ashtrays, one of them lined with ceramic golf balls, and has a 
closet crammed with gear, including a left-handed mashie made in 1887. 
</P>
<P>
In front of his house stands a hallowed out stump that serves as target 
practice for Hallberg's pitching wedge. His "lawn," or what's left of it, is 
riddled with divots. A shanked pitching wedge resulted in a broken window. Golf 
balls roll around on the floor of his car. 
</P>
<P>
He has traveled from England to Israel in search of the holiest of grails: the 
perfect golf course. Hallberg was so overwhelmed by a course in Scotland, he 
nearly dropped to his knees and wept. By his own count, Hallberg has played on 
more than a thousand courses and is seeking new ones all the time. 
</P>
<P>
How did it ever get this far? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it may be the last bastion of civility in sport," Hallberg said. "It's 
also a sport that requires a different playing field every time. It's also a 
mass participation sport. Folks in their 90s play it. Everyone has some 
aesthetic connection to the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Hallberg, the son of a zoology professor, had a golf course across the street 
when he grew up in Bowling Green, Ohio. He started playing at age 9, at first 
gripping the club like a baseball bat. His game soon improved -- he now lists 
his handicap at about seven -- and his passion began. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the greenness of the sport. I liked the difficulty of the sport. It 
was a sport where you could never achieve perfection. There's infinite room for 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager he read F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story, "Winter Dreams," and 
became interested in golf literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf yields up beautiful short stories," said Hallberg, who compiled "Perfect 
Lies," a collection of golf stories that includes works by Ring Lardner, John 
Updike and Walker Percy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are countless numbers of baseball novels, probably 20 or 30 that are 
very good, but very few good short stories. It's the exact opposite with golf. 
I've got hundreds of golf novels, but they're usually mysteries or kind of 
corny, foolish parodies of the game. Never has there really been a novel that 
seriously explored the metaphorical possibilities of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Not wishing to let baseball have all the glory, Hallberg began writing "Rub of 
the Green," published last year. Hallberg worked on the book for a year and a 
half, at times finding sentence construction as frustrating as the 18th hole at 
Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of times I wanted to tear it up and throw it away. I'm the same kind of 
writer as I am a golfer, I just go back. You hit one good shot and you want to 
go back and play it again. You get one good line you go back to the typewriter 
and say to yourself, 'I can have that kind of day again."' 
</P>
<P>
He limits himself to once a week on the course during the school year, but 
indulges once classes let out, often playing every other day. Hallberg will 
head for Scotland this summer, hoping to discover four or five great unknown 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
"When I fly on an airplane and look out the window, I'm looking for golf 
courses. That's what I do. 'There's a golf course right there, it looks like a 
nice layout.' 'There's a bad one."' 
</P>
<P>
But what makes a great course? 
</P>
<P>
"A golf course that really appeals to me is one that's honed right out of the 
terrain, that doesn't bring in a lot of dirt," said Hallberg, a reviewer for 
Golf Digest. 
</P>
<P>
"The trees that were there are still there. The dunes and mountainsides that 
pre-existed the golf course are complete. The best golf courses compliment what 
nature's already provided."

BANNING BASKETBALL OPENS GAMES WITH WIN ON FREE THROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM DERMODY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Coach Gary Cain's own admission, the Banning High School boys basketball 
team will be inexperienced next season. For openers, all five starters are 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
But if Jabari Anderson has anything to say about it Banning may be a factor 
come November. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who will be a junior, sank two free throws with no time remaining 
Saturday morning to lift the host Pilots to a 51-49 victory over Culver City in 
the opening round of the L.A. Games. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a 6-3 forward who is projected as the team's starting guard, was 
fouled with the clock showing no time remaining. He calmly strode to the line 
and sank both shots to give the Pilots the victory, and a shot at defending 
champion Westchester, which defeated Palos Verdes, 48-41, in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots host Westchester today at 9 a.m. in the second round of the 22nd 
L.A. Games, which previews next year's high school standouts in a variety of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Anderson) is just a 10th-grader who will be a junior when school starts, 
but we've already projected him as our most outstanding player," Cain said. 
"He's going to be a real good athlete for us." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson led all scorers with 14 points, while Julio Muro tallied 13 for the 
Pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester, a small team, was missing its biggest man, 6-8 junior LeRoy 
Anderson, who was attending basketball camp in Long Beach, Nevertheless, the 
Comets played well enough to advance to the second round by beating Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of had our midget lineup in there today," said Comets Coach Ed Azzam. 
" But we were able to jump out to a 12-point lead early and just held them off. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's OK. That's what we're going to have to do this year. If we get a 
team in the 70's and 80's, we don't have the depth to hold them off." 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round basketball action, Mira Costa beat Mayfair, 32-28. Mira 
Costa faces Lynwood today at noon at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne, Rolling Hills, Carson, Hawthorne and Morningside also advanced to 
today's second round action. 
</P>
<P>
In baseball, Redondo Union shut out Bosco Tech, 3-0, and will host Garfield 
today at noon. Carson, the only other South Bay team entered in the L.A. Games 
baseball competition, scored an 11-6 victory over Sierra Vista. The Colts play 
Riverside Poly this morning at 9 at El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance served as the football venue and the Saxons used the home-field 
advantage to score a 12-6 first-round win over Cerritos Village Christian. 
North then forged a second-round, 27-13, victory over University High of Irvine 
to earn the right to face Santiago. Santiago, of Garden Grove, defeated 
Narbonne, 14-0. North hosts Santiago at 1:40 this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The football team from West Torrance also fared well in the opening round, 
scoring a 16-6 victory over Bassett, before coming back in the afternoon to 
rout Gardena, 30-0. The Warriors face L.A. Wilson today at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester surprised defending L.A. City 4-A champion Carson, 22-21. The 
Comets, who advanced to the second round with a forfeit, face Rancho Alamitos 
of Garden Grove today at 2:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside defeated L.A. Jordan, 25-6, and goes on to play L.A. Baptist, which 
defeated Palos Verdes, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
In other first round games, Redondo fell to L.A. Wilson, 18-14, and San Pedro 
was defeated by Granada Hills Kennedy, 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
In softball, West Torrance beat Narbonne, 10-0, and Rolling Hills scored a 13-4 
victory over Pioneer of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay was well represented on the soccer field, where three boys and 
two girls teams advanced to today's second-round action. 
</P>
<P>
In boys competition, Palos Verdes defeated Hollywood, 5-4. Palos Verdes will 
play Crespi of Encino, which beat Inglewood, 1-0, today at 9:45 a.m., at 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance downed Burbank Burroughs, 1-0, and plays Loyola today at 9:45 
a.m.. San Pedro defeated, Claremont, 4-1, and faces Harvard, which defeated 
Leuzinger, 3-2, today at 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In girls' play, Mira Costa defeated El Segundo, 2-1, and earns the right to 
play Chatsworth today at 9:45 a.m. Chatsworth eliminated West Torrance, 4-1, in 
the preliminary round. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro downed St. Bernard, 1-0, and will face Arcadia today at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, a 1-0 winner over Los Altos in the first round, takes on Royal of

COOK PASSES FOR 2 SCORES TO LEAD EAST TO 12-7 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Cook of Newbury Park High passed for 190 yards and two touchdowns to lead 
the East to a 12-7 victory over the West in the 16th Ventura County All-Star 
game Saturday night at Hueneme High. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who has signed a letter of intent to play football at UCLA this fall, 
completed 10 of 17 passes despite playing only a little more than two quarters. 
Cook was named the game's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
The West made a late surge but the East held on when Jeff Moore of Thousand 
Oaks recovered a fumble at the 17-yard-line with 24 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
The East took a 6-0 lead as Cook capped a 10-play, 98-yard drive with a 24-yard 
touchdown pass to Royal's Pat Ledesma with 4:47 to play in the first quarter. 
Ledesma, a quarterback last season who played wide receiver in the all-star 
game, was left uncovered and waited patiently for about 10 seconds before a 
scrambling Cook located him. 
</P>
<P>
The East added a touchdown in the second quarter on what could easily have been 
a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
Cook was pressured out of the pocket and, scrambling, lofted a pass high 
downfield in the vicinity of four West defenders. But it was Royal wide 
receiver James Jones who reached up behind the defenders to grab the ball and 
take a couple of easy steps into the end zone with a 60-yard touchdown 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
"We had nothing to lose, so I threw it as far as I could and he made a great 
catch," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake tailback Keith Burke helped keep defensive pressure off Cook by 
rushing for 96 yards in 18 carries with a stellar performance at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line really opened up the holes for me tonight and it was a 
really great experience," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
The touted offensive potential of the West never got in gear and the team's 
only score came on a trick play. 
</P>
<P>
Hueneme's Carlos Cardenas took a handoff on a fake punt and scrambled 45 yards 
for a touchdown in the third quarter.

SALKELD BATTERED, BUT EAST RALLIES TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East co-Coach Gary Donatella rubbed his bruised rib cage and wondered aloud 
what had gone wrong. If Donatella ever wondered how many stitches there are in 
a baseball, all he has to do is check the divot in his right side, where on 
Saturday a deflected Roger Salkeld fastball slammed into him at about 90 m. p. 
h. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Bernie Milligan All-Star baseball game, in fact, the Sylmar High 
coach even took precautions to make sure something like this wouldn't happen. 
Pregame arrangements or not, however, in the second inning, Donatella was 
temporarily on his knees. 
</P>
<P>
And so was his team. 
</P>
<P>
"Before it started, I told a couple of guys, 'When Salkeld's on the hill, you 
stand here and you stand here,' " said Donatella, who was knocked down while 
standing in the first-base dugout. "I don't know what happened. Call it 
inexperience -- it was my first all-star game." 
</P>
<P>
The shot Donatella absorbed -- a second-inning foul ball off the bat of West 
infielder Terry Hill -- wasn't the only rocket hit off the All-American 
right-hander, but the East rallied from a sluggish start and put the slug on 
the West, 13-5, at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the fourth in a row for the East, which leads the series, 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
As improbable as it sounds, the West held a 3-1 lead after two innings against 
Salkeld, and more than a few wished the Southern Section 3-A Division Player of 
the Year and first-round draft choice could have stayed in the game a little 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Three runs off of Salkeld, we were looking good," West co-Coach Kevin Campbell 
quipped. "Too bad we didn't get him for nine innings." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, after scoring three runs in the bottom of the second -- for the sake of 
comparative analysis, Salkeld allowed only nine earned runs in 108 2/3 innings 
this season -- the West took a 3-1 lead. The West banged out four consecutive 
hits in the inning, including a double to right by Jason Shapiro and singles by 
Pat DeBoer and Jason Jones, all of which drove in runs. The rally raised the 
eyebrows of one team and the hopes of another. 
</P>
<P>
As Donatella can testify, a 90 m.p.h. pitch travels just as fast when it's 
coming the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've got a lot of good hitters and you throw the ball hard, it's going 
to be hit hard," West co-Coach Dave Desmond said. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, who had not pitched under game conditions in two weeks, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit the ball well," he said. "It's an all-star team, the best players in 
the section. They're supposed to hit the ball." 
</P>
<P>
After a leadoff double in the first inning by Jones, Salkeld struck out the 
side before running into trouble in the second. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little surprised by that," Donatella said of Salkeld's second-inning 
struggle. "I asked him if he wanted to go back in after that and he said, 'No 
problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Salkeld -- who earned the victory -- knew something, because the East 
scored twice in the third and four times in the fourth against losing 
right-hander Mitch Cizek of Kennedy, who surrendered seven hits, walked three 
and hit a batter in 1 2/3 innings. Salkeld left after the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Like Donatella, the West could run, but it couldn't hide. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody on this team is a good hitter," said East first baseman Ray Gardocki 
of Hart, who was three for four with three runs batted in and was named the 
game's most valuable player. "We were just having fun, we were all relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
The East put a sleeper hold on the West in the seventh. Trailing, 8-5, the West 
loaded the bases against right-hander Roland De La Maza. However, Mike Murray 
struck out looking on an 0-and-2 curve and Vince Simili grounded to short. 
</P>
<P>
The East scored two unearned runs in the eighth on a two-run single by Jose 
Gallegos of Sylmar to take a 10-5 lead. The West committed five errors in all, 
botched a run-down play that led to a run and stranded a runner in every inning 
but the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"Some weird things happened," Desmond said. "We didn't play defensively very 
well, we missed some scoring chances . . . Maybe the moons weren't aligned or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
A ninth-inning moon shot by East designated-hitter Bobby Hughes gave the East a 
13-5 lead. Hughes finished with two hits and four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it looked promising for the underdog West, especially early. 
Expecting to get plowed under in a harvest of heat, the West was knocked down 
by a bushel of bats. 
</P>
<P>
"But they had the timely hits and we made some errors at bad times," Campbell 
said. "It's an all-star game. Everyone here can hit."

Pitcher Chris Brown improved his record to 3-0 in a complete-game four-hitter. 
He struck out eight, walked one and was helped by standout defense -- Woodland 
Hills East made no errors.

"We stress defense and all our players are capable of rising to the occasions. 
And Chris Brown pitched a magnificent game," said Matt Borzello, Woodland Hills 
East coach.

RISK OF TB EXPOSURE HIGHER AMONG INMATES

<P>
It was bad enough that Antti Haavisto coughed up blood in his prison cell all 
night. He also had to listen to death threats from neighboring inmates kept 
sleepless by his ceaseless hacking. 
</P>
<P>
"Hurry up and die," convicts snarled through the steel bars inside Stillwater 
Prison in eastern Minnesota. "Shut up or we'll shut you up." 
</P>
<P>
Haavisto's lungs were being consumed by tuberculosis, which remained 
undiagnosed through 11 visits to sick call over six months in 1982. Prison 
doctors failed to spot the TB on two X-rays. Although Haavisto was coughing up 
sputum with the consistency of sludge, the doctors told him he had emphysema or 
pneumonia and gave him cough drops to ease the hacking. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to die. I couldn't get air in, and I couldn't cough that 
mud out. I almost drowned twice," said the wheezing Haavisto, a Finnish 
immigrant convicted of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I'd go to eat, I tried to cough up enough stuff so I didn't bother 
anyone. I was afraid they would hate me and beat me up," Haavisto, 64, said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Contagious 
</P>
<P>
Even after Haavisto was diagnosed and released from prison in May, 1983, the 
airborne germ stalked the Stillwater cellblocks. 
</P>
<P>
One year after Haavisto's diagnosis, the prisoner in the next cell came down 
with TB. An outbreak occurred in 1984, when inmates sued the prison for 
deficient medical care, and another rash of infections hit in 1986, when the 
entire prison was finally tested. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, one-third of the 1,200 inmates and at least five guards were 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis is a bacterial lung disease once known as consumption because it 
eats away lung tissue. Scientists estimate that 10 million Americans are 
infected, but the vast majority will never get the disease. 
</P>
<P>
TB is far worse in crowded prisons. Lawyers and inmate advocates say TB 
outbreaks show what can happen when a contagious disease infects a closed 
environment with antiquated ventilation systems and inattentive medical 
watchdogs. 
</P>
<P>
The incidence of TB among prisoners is more than triple the rate of those not 
in jail, according to a May report by the federal Centers for Disease Control. 
In New Jersey, the rate is 11 times higher for inmates; in California, six 
times higher. New York prisons had a sevenfold increase in the disease in the 
10-year period ending in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC recommended these corrective measures for prisons: TB tests at least 
once a year, quick X-rays for inmates showing symptoms and isolation of those 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, federal Judge Diana Murphy said the handling of the epidemic by 
prison officials and the state Department of Health "evidenced a lack of care 
or reckless disregard for the medical needs of inmates." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditions Improved 
</P>
<P>
In January, five years after the lawsuit was filed, she ruled that conditions 
had improved and there was no need to order corrective actions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she severely criticized prison administrators, saying they 
"passed off responsibility to (the) Department of Health, which assigned 
responsibility to the doctors, who denied any role in managing the crisis other 
than (in) providing primary care." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shocking case of negligence," said Stephen Miles of the University of 
Chicago's Center for Clinical Medical Ethics. "Prisoners were not only 
incarcerated but negligently exposed to a contagious disease." 
</P>
<P>
"The prison became a pest hole of tuberculosis infection. Not only was there 
neglect, prison officials turned a blind eye to known facts. There was 
recklessness," said Arlo Vandevegte, attorney for the inmates who sued the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Haavisto apparently brought the TB with him into Stillwater. On his trips to 
sick call, he even suggested the medical staff check for TB. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I think I got some real bad problem. I couldn't talk. I couldn't 
even make a phone call it was so bad," Haavisto said. "I said I got to get out 
of this hole or I'm going to die in here." 
</P>
<P>
Inmate Tony DeGidio contracted TB during the epidemic. His father caught it 
when he came to the prison to visit Tony. 
</P>
<P>
"You're trapped. You don't have a way out," DeGidio said. "We used to tell the 
guards to do something. This guy's got a problem. Treat it or we're going to 
treat it our way. Eliminate him." 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials say treatment and tracking have improved. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have those problems now," said LeRoy Siegel, executive assistant to 
Stillwater's warden. "We responded the way the so-called experts told us to."

BIG MAC'S MYSTERY; 
</P>
<P>
STALLED INVESTIGATION, RUMORS OF HIDDEN FORTUNE ARE VICTIM'S LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Big Mac" -- burly Horace J. McKenna -- has been dead for three months now. But 
authorities are still wondering who killed him and what happened to the 
millions of dollars in cash they believe he was skimming from hidden ownership 
in several nude and topless bars. 
</P>
<P>
And McKenna's son, 23-year-old Michael, is still trying to sort out his 
father's legitimate financial affairs amid rumors that there is illegal money 
buried somewhere or stashed in banks out of his reach. 
</P>
<P>
Big Mac McKenna, 46, was killed gangland-style in the early morning hours of 
March 9 as he slept in the back seat of his limousine. The car was riddled with 
bullets as his driver got out to swing open the iron gates to Tara, the 
$825,000 estate McKenna owned in Brea's Carbon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The Brea police detective who says he interviewed dozens of associates and 
friends of McKenna's, trying to find the killer or killers, recently moved on 
to other cases. Detective Grant Gulickson said he has some suspicions as to who 
might have killed McKenna -- or at least had a motive -- but not enough 
evidence to arrest anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Gulickson said the investigation has stalled because "many of McKenna's 
associates are also crooks" who fear they would implicate themselves if they 
talked about him. Although many of them openly disliked McKenna, who was 
6-foot-6, nearly 300 pounds and never hesitated to throw his weight around, 
they had a "bigger hate for cops than they had a loathe for Mac," Gulickson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna's death has set back a criminal tax fraud investigation that was under 
way at the time of the slaying. McKenna and his partner, Michael Woods, were 
believed to be hidden owners of several nude and topless clubs from which they 
allegedly were reporting only a portion of the income. 
</P>
<P>
While the investigation into Woods' finances is ongoing, "you can't prosecute a 
dead man," Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Senior Investigator Robert H. Hausken 
said of McKenna. However, a civil tax fraud inquiry focusing on McKenna's 
estate is also continuing. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna died just one day after crucial search warrants were made public. The 
warrants detailed how McKenna and Woods allegedly pocketed as much as half the 
profits from such clubs as Bare Elegance, the New Jet Strip and the Star Strip 
near Los Angeles International Airport and April's Cabaret and the Odd Ball in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators estimated that the clubs grossed as much as $2.5 million per 
year. At April's Cabaret, they said, there were two safes: one where employees 
locked up half of the night's receipts and the other a slotted safe -- for 
which the employees had no key -- where they put the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Gulickson said he believes that the money is now stashed. "I personally believe 
a great deal of it went out of the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of McKenna's slaying has led to speculation that he might have been 
killed by someone who did not want him to be able to negotiate with authorities 
by informing on others involved. However, Gulickson said he had no indication 
after McKenna's death that the victim would have aided in the investigation 
and, in fact, thought McKenna might have been a macho kind of man who would 
remain loyal to his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Hausken, who had watched McKenna and Woods for months, said he was disappointed 
when McKenna was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd grown to respect him -- not for the person he was, not like you would 
respect the President or an astronaut. But here was a guy who had built himself 
an empire and he ruled it out of force and fear. . . ." Hausken said. "He was a 
worthy opponent. He really was, and he knew it. He knew we were after him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convicted of Counterfeiting 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, a former California Highway Patrol officer, was convicted in 1976 of 
counterfeiting and convicted in 1982 of a parole violation after he was 
arrested on suspicion of assaulting an off-duty police officer. Hausken said 
jokingly that McKenna was known as "the most successful graduate" of the CHP 
academy because he went on to make so much money. 
</P>
<P>
On another legal front, the probate of McKenna's estate is being overseen by 
his son, Michael, who at 6-foot-9 could easily inherit his father's nickname. 
He now is ensconced as the new proprietor of the secluded Tara. The 40-acre 
estate, built with a "Gone With the Wind" theme, has stunning vistas of Orange 
County, a horse stable and the mock Western town his father was building for 
the amusement of friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I've grown to love it up here. The peace, quiet," Michael said one morning 
recently as he nibbled on stale popcorn and drank Gatorade straight from the 
bottle in the kitchen of the house on top of the knoll at Tara. "I would like 
to keep it." Michael is an only child, and his mother and father were divorced. 
</P>
<P>
The younger McKenna, whose height leaves him with the friendly, loose-jointed 
gait of a basketball player as opposed to his father's intimidating bulk of a 
prizefighter, has strongly defended his father. Although he did not see much of 
McKenna before his death, the son occasionally spent time with him and his 
friends at Tara. He said that if his father was into illegal activities, he 
never knew it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be interested in those kinds of clubs anyway," he said, although he 
conceded they were "great moneymakers, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lives on Estate 
</P>
<P>
Michael now occupies the house with a few of his friends. It is an eclectic 
affair whose main decoration is his father's collection of about a dozen bronze 
sculptures of Western scenes. McKenna has moved these into the living room, 
which is incongruently furnished with feminine French provincial furniture 
(apparently left over from McKenna's marriage), a baby grand piano and a 
gigantic python snakeskin that cuts diagonally across the carpet. The elder 
McKenna had just built a pool on the property and had nearly finished the ghost 
town. He kept 15 horses, mostly Arabians, at the stables just below the house. 
</P>
<P>
Until March 9, Michael considered himself just an average young guy trying to 
make his way in the world. He had just gotten a job as a security guard and 
lived with his father's parents. He surfed. He had a steady girlfriend. His 
only bills were a car payment and car insurance. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the kind of life style that prepared him to deal with his father's 
far-reaching -- and at best confusing -- business affairs. Besides, most of his 
father's financial records had been seized in the probe of his ownership of the 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"You've heard the expression you're dropped off in a pile of (excrement). Well, 
I was about 8 feet under," said the younger McKenna. "I'm only out to 6 feet, 
I'm just breathing again. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned more in three months since this has happened than I think most 
people learn in their lifetimes." 
</P>
<P>
At first Michael tried to keep track of the income and outflow from his 
father's legitimate businesses -- the 4 Star Gym in El Segundo and two small 
apartment buildings. He became so stressed over this and "all of the stuff that 
was on my mind" that he ended up in the hospital one night with acute stomach 
pains. Since then, he has hired a friend to keep track of the books. In the 
aftermath of the slaying, he also broke up with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Don't Trust Anybody' 
</P>
<P>
But Michael also sounded as if he was learning something about how to take care 
of himself. In a recent telephone conversation with his grandmother, the 
younger McKenna told her not to talk to any of his father's pals. Later, he 
said, "a lot of my father's friends, I told them right to their faces that I 
don't trust anybody and I don't trust you." 
</P>
<P>
Michael said rumors of vast wealth found buried at Tara are untrue. Hausken 
said there was speculation that Big Mac had buried money in a sewer main at 
Tara. Workers recently dug a hole as big as a small bedroom in the front yard, 
but Michael said it was to fix a water pipe. He said some money -- he would not 
say how much -- was found in a safe in the house. He has been using it to keep 
the ranch going while the estate is probated, which could take two years. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said he may sell his father's horses -- which he said are worth between 
$2,000 and $30,000 each -- or even get a job to tide himself over until he is 
clear owner of the ranch and his father's other property. As for his father's 
alleged ownership of the nude and topless bars, the young McKenna said he is 
been unable to find any proof of it. And if Big Mac's partner, Woods, has a 
stash of money from the bars, he isn't sharing it, Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if his father actually owned the nightclubs, he said, any such partnership 
between Woods and his father would necessarily have had to have been by a 
handshake, he said. The elder McKenna, as a convicted felon, could not own the 
clubs outright. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no proof, there's no evidence, there's no witnesses to the agreement," 
Michael said, describing the hypothetical partnership. "So in a sense it's like 
if . . . two people got hold of a million dollars and they decided to split it, 
but neither one of them have (possession of) it, it's just sitting there. When 
the time comes they'll split it. If one of them died, the other one got all of 
it. And if the other person had a son, let's say like me, and I came in and I 
knew about it but I had no proof, the guy says: 'No, no, no. It's all mine.' 
And what can you say? You can't say anything. You sit there and say, 'Oh, 
well.' " 
</P>
<P>
The son has his own theories as to what his father would have done had he 
skimmed from the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming there was that much of an income, you've got to think that a man like 
that, if there was that money, he's not going to want to keep it around," 
Michael said. "He's going to want to get rid of it, get rid of it anyway you 
can. In bronze artworks maybe, the pool, the horses, paying out employees. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
But Detective Gulickson said that even if there wasn't hidden cash, there are 
enough assets in the estate to take care of McKenna's son. "I do not think the 
kid is going to have a financial worry for the rest of his life," he said.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be few Father's Day weekends as memorable for Gary and Tony 
Aliengena as the one they spent on this small North Atlantic island nation. 
</P>
<P>
The father-son team from San Juan Capistrano, piloting around the world in an 
attempt to establish Tony as the youngest aviator ever to circumnavigate the 
globe, spent Saturday on the ground, fishing, after 12 days in the air crossing 
the United States, Canada and Greenland on the way to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
After a nine-hour flight Friday across the North Atlantic, the 11-year-old 
aviator was determined to try his luck fishing, and he announced his intentions 
to do so at breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
So Tony, his father and Tony's Soviet pen pal, 10-year-old Roman Tcheremnykh, 
unpacked their fishing rods and set out on Saturday afternoon to test the water 
on a nearby lake. They returned empty-handed. "We just froze," said Gary 
Aliengena, a certified pilot who has accompanied Tony in a one-engine Cessna 
Centurion. "We didn't even get a bite." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their lack of luck at the lake, the stopover in Iceland was anything 
but dull. 
</P>
<P>
It was National Day in Iceland, a day of feast and celebration commemorating 
the nation's independence from Denmark on June 18, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Icelanders, decked out in colorful Nordic dress, jammed 
the parks and streets of this small capital, kicking up their heels to polka 
music, cheering on outdoor wrestling matches and providing a spectacle for 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The Icelandic capital seems a long way from Boston, where Tony began the second 
week of his around-the-world flight Tuesday. More precisely, it was 3,000 
miles, about the same distance he traveled in crossing the United States in the 
first week after leaving John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian crossing was the best so far of the trip, as the entourage flew 
over vast lakes and forests, rich in caribou, bear and moose. 
</P>
<P>
Departing Boston on Tuesday, Tony encountered a large storm system with light 
ice at higher altitudes. The storm system persisted through Maine to the 
Canadian border, where the clouds broke up and the weather was clear all the 
way to Moncton, where Tony and his entourage from one chase plane spent the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
With time dwindling rapidly for the Atlantic crossing, the entourage did not 
get a chance to visit two of Moncton's natural attractions: the Magnetic Hill, 
where cars appear to roll uphill, and the Tidal Bore, where a tidal surge 
occurs twice daily on the Peditcodiac River. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's father and Gunter Hagen, a National Aeronautic Assn. observer aboard 
Tony's plane, spent hours poring over aeronautical charts to prepare for the 
crossing. They also checked out survival gear required by Canadian law for 
transoceanic flights, including life rafts and preservers, wet suits and 
flares. In addition, pilots of each plane brought enough candy to sustain each 
passenger for five days. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Gary Aliengena underwent questioning and an inspection of 
his Cessna by a Canadian aviation representative to obtain clearance to cross 
the Atlantic. The clearance is required in Canada only of single-engine planes. 
</P>
<P>
In a coffee shop at Moncton Airport, Transport Canada inspector Bob Lavers 
asked the 39-year-old Aliengena such questions as how many people he could hold 
on his lifeboat and the types of emergency radios he had on board. Afterward, 
Lavers nodded his approval at Aliengena's preparation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watch Weather 
</P>
<P>
"Just be sure to keep a close eye on weather," Lavers said. "It's a very 
hostile environment up north, and there's a lot of water. If you go down in the 
water (without wet suits and lifeboats), your chances of survival are nil." 
</P>
<P>
Tony's group eventually arrived in Iqaluit, a village with a population of 
3,000, on the shores of an inlet that plunges between the low rock hills of 
southern Baffin Island. 
</P>
<P>
In Iqaluit, formerly known as Frobisher Bay, the weary travelers were 
enthralled to find a world of Inuits, polar bears and 24-hour sun. 
</P>
<P>
During April, Indian natives are drawn from the surrounding High Arctic islands 
for Iqaluit's Toonik Tyme carnival. The carnival, which celebrates the arrival 
of spring, features skinning, igloo building, ice sculpturing and a toboggan 
race. The highlight is the choosing of a Mr. Toonik and a queen. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting at airport at Iqaluit was a delegation of Canadian dignitaries, who 
presented Tony with a polar bear flag and a certificate naming him and his crew 
members to the polar bear chapter of the Charter of Arctic Adventurers. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Tony got a chance to meet some Inuit youngsters about his own age. 
After introducing himself and answering questions from about 50 students of 
Nakasuk Elementary School, Tony then took turns asking questions, inquiring how 
many of the children had dog sleds and how sealskin tents and igloos are made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close Call 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Tony and Roman participated in a school track meet. But the most fun 
for Tony almost resulted in a serious mishap. Tony and some other youngsters on 
the trip had all been invited to drive around on a Hoverjet, which uses a 
cushion of air to glide on a frozen bay. 
</P>
<P>
Tony drove the craft, as did his sister, but when Roman and another boy climbed 
on, they crashed into a ditch. The steering wheel of the Hoverjet was broken in 
the accident, but none of the youngsters were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Greenland, where he stopped for refueling, Tony could not escape the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the terminal at Sondrestrom, a U.S. Air Force base wedged at the head of 
a fiord, the clerks and workers bursted with excitement at Tony's two-hour 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear about the boy on radio," said Asprid Jensen, 24, a postal clerk. "Many 
of the clerks here asked yesterday, 'Where's that boy? Where's that boy?' " 
</P>
<P>
Tony seemed to barely notice the attention, however. Fatigued from his 
four-hour flight from Iqaluit to Sondrestrom, he checked into a hotel room at 
the airport and napped before setting out on his next 860 miles to Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
In Reykjavik on Saturday night, Tony and his father finally acquiesced to a 
little sightseeing. They dined at the Reykjavik Cafe and afterward toured the 
Hofdi House, a government building where former President Reagan and Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev met three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
There was no time to take in any of Iceland's spectacular geologic attractions, 
which include volcanoes, glaciers and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Oslo, Tony is scheduled to rest another day before setting 
out Tuesday on a relatively short 250-mile flight to Stockholm. Later in the 
week, he will visit Helsinki, Finland, before entering the Soviet Union on 
Friday at Leningrad.

LEADERS SEEK VIETNAMESE HOLDING CENTERS TO STALL REPATRIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Unable to persuade Hong Kong, Thailand and other "first asylum" countries to 
change their plans to screen Vietnamese refugees, Southern California 
Vietnamese leaders said Saturday that they will focus new attention on 
establishing regional holding centers to prevent people from being sent back to 
Vietnam against their will. 
</P>
<P>
Returning from the International Conference on Indochinese Refugees in Geneva, 
the local delegates representing Orange County's estimated 100,000 Vietnamese 
said that the fate of tens of thousands of refugees in detention camps 
throughout Southeast Asia remains uncertain because most of the countries 
housing the refugees have refused to reject the policy of forced repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
These first-asylum countries -- Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia 
and British-governed Hong Kong -- account for more than 66,000 Vietnamese "boat 
people" who fled their country hoping to immigrate to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by more than 70 nations, was convened to discuss 
common strategies in dealing with the refugees, and served as a forum for 
expatriate Vietnamese groups such as those from Southern California to press 
for reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Wilson, a Tustin High School physics teacher whose Vietnamese wife is in a 
refugee camp along the Thai-Cambodian border, was a member of a group from 
Orange County that traveled to Geneva in the hope of bringing about change. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who is active in the UCI-based refugee-assistance group Project Pearl, 
said the local delegation distributed a resolution opposing both "screening" 
and forced repatriation policies used by some governments. 
</P>
<P>
Under the screening process, adopted by Hong Kong where nearly 30,000 
Vietnamese have fled, refugees can be declared "economic migrants" instead of 
political refugees and be told to return to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"It breaks my heart to see people who put their lives on the line to flee be 
sent back," Wilson said. "The rule of thumb in Vietnam is if you flee, the 
chances are only 1 in 3 you will live through it, and still people are leaving. 
The screening process is spurious." 
</P>
<P>
"We basically lost our stand as far as screening," he added. "We were trying to 
take the moral high ground. Screening implies forced repatriation." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wilson, others attending the conference were Irvine residents 
and Project Pearl activists Lam Vu, Van-Khanh Le and My-Nga Le; Ban Binh Bui, 
an official of the Council for Refugee Rights and a Westminster businessman; 
and Santa Ana resident Thai Dinh of the SOS Boat People Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The international conference reached no consensus, but the countries housing 
the refugees all indicated that screening would continue and some indicated 
they would resort to forced repatriation for the "economic migrants." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said a new strategy will now have to be developed, one that most likely 
would focus on the establishment of regional holding centers in the 
"first-asylum" countries and operated by international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"At least with an international organization running it, you have some 
assurance of a non-hostile environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One idea, Wilson said, would be to have those declared "economic migrants" to 
spend a period of time in the holding centers, after which they would become 
eligible to be permanently resettled in other countries with relatives, friends 
or loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to avoid them being sent back if they don't want to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the Southern California Vietnamese leaders were joined by 
Vietnamese leaders from across Europe opposed to forced repatriation. There 
were hunger strikes and demonstrations and statements of support from both the 
United States and the Vatican, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) was a member of the U.S. delegation and 
spoke strongly against any policy under which people were forced to return to 
Vietnam against their will. 
</P>
<P>
As for Vietnam, its delegates said they would not accept people forced back by 
other countries, only those who chose to return voluntarily. The dilemma, 
Wilson said, is the thousands of people stuck in camps and holding centers, 
unwanted both by the host countries and the Western nations that have resettled 
thousands of others. 
</P>
<P>
Van Thai Tran, a UC Irvine student and former legislative coordinator of 
Project Pearl, said the outcome of the conference was disappointing but no 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"When we embarked on this project three months ago we knew it would not be 
easy," he said. "We are talking about international policies of countries that 
could care less about democratic principles. But morally, we could not sit on 
our hands and do nothing. We were once former refugees ourselves not so long 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had to jump up and take advantage and scream and yell and do whatever 
we can so these governments will hear us. At least they will know where we 
stand, that we want freedom and a new life for these people."

HIGH FASHION, HIGH-TOPS MINGLE AS UCI CONFERS DIPLOMAS ON 3,059

For his graduation Saturday from UC Irvine, Joseph Imbriano wanted to do it in 
style. 
</P>
<P>
The bow tie of Imbriano's crimson-and-black tuxedo peeked out from beneath his 
black gown as he walked across the stage after Chancellor Jack W. Peltason 
called his name. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good day," said Imbriano, 22, a Garden Grove resident who graduated 
with a double major in biology and chemistry. "On a good day you want to look 
good and feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday was a feel-good day for the 3,059 students who received their diplomas 
from UC Irvine -- the college's largest graduating class ever. In fact, there 
were so many graduates that the university had to have three commencement 
ceremonies -- at 9 a.m., and 1 and 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand family members and friends of the graduates converged on 
Aldrich Park in the center of the campus, taking seats in white folding chairs 
and waiting for the ceremony to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see him?" asked one anxious grandmother, craning her neck to scan the 
sea of dark robes assembled behind the chairs. "I thought I saw him." 
</P>
<P>
As the steady beat of Pomp and Circumstance bounced off nearby buildings, the 
candidates walked down the aisles, two by two. Some wore sunglasses while 
others clutched bouquets of flowers and balloons. High-top sneakers marched 
alongside delicate high heels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parade of Speakers 
</P>
<P>
They were seated, and listened more or less attentively to a parade of 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Student Body President David Hurwitz announced that the gift from the Class of 
'89 to UC Irvine would be a victory flagpole on which the Anteater flag would 
be hoisted each time a university athletic team prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Shepherd, a biology sciences major who was selected as the student 
speaker, urged his classmates "to persevere, to reap our reward as we have done 
at UCI." Shepherd's biggest applause came when he recalled "camping out 
overnight (to register) for classes we didn't want to take from teachers we 
really don't want to know," and when he lamented the university's chronic 
shortage of parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Peltason, taking note of the number of buildings being built on 
campus, predicted that the graduates "will bore your children with stories of 
the good old days when UCI stood for 'Under Construction Indefinitely.' " 
</P>
<P>
Peltason also said that this graduation was symbolic "as a link between old and 
new California." UC Irvine's increasingly diverse student population of Asians, 
blacks, Latinos and others reflects the ethnic future of the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Be sure to keep your individual cultures," Peltason said, "but also recognize 
what we have in common." 
</P>
<P>
Decorum among the students began to erode as Peltason started announcing the 
names of all the graduates. An inflatable Shamu the whale was bounced around a 
few rows before being confiscated by university police. A group of mechanical 
engineering students stripped down to shorts and T-shirts, trading their 
mortarboards for blue-and-white striped baseball caps from which orange tassels 
dangled. 
</P>
<P>
As the mid-morning sun intensified, many of those in attendance took refuge 
under nearby trees and fanned themselves with copies of the graduation program. 
A snack stand selling soft drinks did a brisk business. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two hours after the ceremony began, Peltason finished conferring the 
degrees and the graduates began the hunt for their families. There was much 
hugging, picture-taking and smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"After five years of hard work, it finally came to an end," said a beaming 
Richard Barretto, 23, a civil engineering graduate from Guam. "I'm all set 
now." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember my freshman year when I first came here -- it was hell," said Trung 
Truong, 22, a biology graduate from Huntington Beach. "In your senior year, you 
learn to relax. This is a great day. It's great to be here."

TONY PENA: BUSY BODY IN NEED OF A REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Pena isn't used to having much free time. 
</P>
<P>
He spent four falls playing football, two winters playing basketball and three 
springs playing baseball for Mater Dei High School. He also played four summers 
of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Pena sat out his freshman baseball season to rest. He ended his basketball 
career after playing on an undefeated junior-varsity team as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
His summer schedule indicates Pena isn't slowing up much, however, despite the 
fact he has dropped football from his play list. 
</P>
<P>
Pena graduated from Mater Dei two weeks ago, then spent 10 days relaxing on the 
beaches of Maui. He said he had a good time, which is a good thing. It might be 
the only break he gets this summer, assuming his tired pitching arm holds up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to keep it pretty mellow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He got off the plane from Hawaii Tuesday and played in the Orange County High 
School all-star baseball game that night. Pitching for the South, the 
right-hander gave up three runs in two innings, but was not involved in the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of embarrassed about the game," he said. "But I didn't pick up a 
ball for 10 days before that night." 
</P>
<P>
Pena was selected to play in a game that matched an Orange County high school 
all-star team against a team from Los Angeles County Thursday night. But he 
decided to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pena is supposed to be part of an Angelus League all-star team that 
plays a team of Sea View League all-stars at 3 p.m. at UC Irvine. He isn't sure 
if he will pitch, however. It depends how his arm feels. 
</P>
<P>
Pena also pitches for the Cardinals, a Connie Mack League youth team. He will 
take a break from the Cardinals, to pitch in the U.S. Olympic Sports Festival 
at Oklahoma City. He was selected, along with Chris Sheff of Laguna Hills, to 
play in the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Pena was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the June free-agent draft, but he 
hasn't talked to them. He hasn't really had the time. 
</P>
<P>
Pena signed a letter of intent to play baseball at Arizona State. The Sun Devil 
coaches asked him to do one thing this summer -- rest his arm. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Arizona State) want me to take it easy," Pena said. "They want my arm to 
be strong when I get there in August." 
</P>
<P>
Pena, 6-foot-2 and almost 200 pounds, was impressive this season for the 
league-champion Monarchs. Pena, who throws mostly a fastball and a split-finger 
fastball, was 12-2 with a 0.57 earned-run average. He had 88 strikeouts in 88 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We used him more than we have used any other pitcher here ever," Mater Dei 
Coach Bob Ickes said. "You could tell by the end of the season that he was 
tired. Maybe the best thing he could do is take a rest." 
</P>
<P>
Pena said he noticed that he was losing something off his fastball toward the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's season ended in a 4-2 extra-inning loss to El Dorado, the eventual 
5-A Southern Section champion. Pena entered that game in the fourth inning and 
didn't allow a run until the eighth. Then El Dorado got three consecutive 
singles and a sacrifice fly to score two runs and end Mater Dei's season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd lost a little zip by the end," Pena said. "But I didn't want the season to 
end with me any other place than on the mound, win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
Pena was named the most valuable player in the Angelus League for the second 
consecutive season. He also was The Times' all-county first-team pitcher. As a 
junior, he was 9-0. He was 3-2 as a sophomore, also on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
His 24-4 career record was impressive, but Pena is also proud of another 
pitching accomplishment. He didn't allow a home run in a high school game. The 
feat is even more impressive when you consider that he pitched about half the 
time at Mater Dei, one of the smallest fields in the Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something that I knew about, but didn't really worry about," Pena said. 
"It just seemed that no matter what, the ball would stay in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Pena could have been busier this summer had he not given up a promising 
football career. 
</P>
<P>
Pena, a wide receiver, was second in Orange County with 64 receptions. He 
averaged 17.1 yards a catch and was an all-Angelus League and Times' all-county 
pick as well. He was selected by the Orange County Athletic Directors Assn. as 
the male athlete of the year for his work in football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Pena was asked to play in the Orange County High School all-star game and the 
Shrine All-Star game, which features the best Los Angles area players. But he 
turned down both invitations. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked football a lot," Pena said. "Being a receiver is a lot like being a 
pitcher. When you line up, it's only you and the guy across from you. I like 
that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to lead anybody (recruiters) on. I knew when football ended last 
fall that was it for me. I just had a feeling that baseball was going to be my 
sport. It's where I see my future." 
</P>
<P>
As long as he gets some rest. 
</P>

SANDS OF TIME CAN'T SLOW THIS BEACH VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, Nina Matthies wandered onto a beach volleyball court 
near her home in Manhattan Beach. She didn't realize it at the time, but that 
day at the beach would leave a lasting impression on her. 
</P>
<P>
A long-lasting impressing. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a century later Matthies still goes to the beach to play 
volleyball on weekends. She's no longer a gangly 11-year-old batting a ball 
over a dipping net with her mother and father, though. She's now a mother, wife 
and coach of one of the nation's top collegiate volleyball teams. 
</P>
<P>
And Matthies, 36, is the second-oldest player on the women's pro beach tour. 
She's also among the winningest on the circuit. Matthies and first-year partner 
Elaine Roque rank fourth in the money standings with $4,421 after finishing no 
lower than fourth in their first four tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Some athletes survive tests of time -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Gordie Howe and 
Nolan Ryan to name a few -- but Matthies said she flourishes because of age and 
experience. She stands only 5 feet 6 1/2 inches, but she seems to tower over 
her taller, younger opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Matthies said her intensity keeps her competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"The older I get," she said, "the more intense I need to be. The younger 
players can play on sheer emotion. I have to be intense, or I won't be as good 
as I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Roque understands Matthies' on-court attitude better than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, intense is only the tip of the iceberg," Roque said. "(She) begins 
with intense and then goes further. She's really fiery. She yells and screams a 
lot. All the top players do. 
</P>
<P>
"We're both perfectionists. We always kid each other after a match. We tell 
each other that we shouldn't make any mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Although they didn't play error-free volleyball, Matthies and Roque cruised 
through two matches Saturday at the Huntington Beach Open to advance in the 
double-elimination tournament. They'll meet Dana Point native Janice Opalinski 
and Linda Chisholm, a 1984 Olympic silver medalist, in the winners' bracket 
semifinals today. 
</P>
<P>
Success has come quickly to Matthies and Roque, the second-seeded team in the 
tournament behind Patty Dodd and Brazilian Olympian Jackie Silva. But it hasn't 
come easily. 
</P>
<P>
They faced a problem when they joined forces at the beginning of season -- both 
played the right side of the court. Matthies volunteered to move to the left 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played (the right) side for 25 years," Matthies said. "I thought my game 
was more adaptable. It's been a fun change." 
</P>
<P>
Matthies has seen many changes in beach volleyball. The sport attracts taller, 
quicker players than before. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have any easy matches anymore," she said. "It has changed from a 
casual meet-at-the beach sport to a business. I run and train every day for 
volleyball. It's not something where you get together and bat the ball around 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Marie Stielow, a second-year player, often seeks Matthies' advice. Stielow and 
tour veteran Roxana Vargas dropped a 15-6 decision to Matthies and Roque in the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
"Nina has helped me a lot," Stielow said. "She encourages me and gives me a lot 
of pointers. She's one of the great players on the tour and I look up to her." 
</P>
<P>
Matthies said beach volleyball also provides supplemental income for her 
family. But something other than money keeps her diving headfirst into the sand 
to save points week after week. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make money at this," she said. "The least we've won this year (in a 
tournament) was $750. But you can't do this for the money. You have to love 
what you're doing. That's why I've been able to play for so long. If I didn't 
love it, I couldn't keep going." 
</P>
<P>
Before turning professional in 1975, Matthies played on two national 
championship teams as a freshman and sophomore at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
After quitting school, she competed in four indoor professional leagues, 
including two co-ed organizations. In 1977, she became an assistant coach at 
UCLA, a job she held until accepting a head coaching job at Pepperdine in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Matthies suffered through a 5-21 season in her first year at Pepperdine, but 
has since guided the Waves to five consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost each time in the first round," she said. "But we always play in the 
West regional, and that's one of the toughest." 
</P>
<P>
In the summer, Matthies leaves indoor volleyball behind. She dons her 
sunglasses and swimsuit and heads for the beach. She's played with a variety of 
partners and had an undefeated season with Linda Robertson in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
She said the weekend tournaments give her time to herself, away from her job, 
husband Dan, a firefighter in Santa Monica, and sons Morgan, 6, and Marty, 4. 
</P>
<P>

A PRIMAVERA OF WHOLE-WHEAT PASTA AND FRESH VEGETABLES

When the weather warms up, garden-fresh vegetables and whole-grain products 
begin to sound especially appealing. "Summer is a great time to get into 
high-fiber foods," says Cheryl Hyman, nutrition consultant and spokesperson for 
the California Dietetic Assn. "Abundance makes for a lot of choices, and the 
pairing of vegetables with foods such as whole-wheat pasta is a lot more 
appetizing than a bowl of oat bran." 
</P>

Inspired by classic Italian pasta primavera, the dish shown here combines 
slivers of zucchini, onion and yellow peppers with whole-wheat spaghetti. 
"Traditional Italian food is very health conscious," adds Nicholas, executive 
chef of Pane Caldo in West Hollywood. "More and more, people order dishes with 
no oil, no butter. Upon request, we'll reduce the butter and leave out the 
salt, using herbs and a good olive oil as a substitute," he continues. Low in 
fat and high in carbohydrates, this pasta combination pairs nicely with a 
clean, intensely flavored fresh pea-and-watercress soup drizzled with a little 
tasty -- but, alas, cholesterol-rich -- sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
ZUCCHINI AND ONION WITH WHOLE-WHEAT PASTA 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds zucchini, seeded 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 medium red onions, halved and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 yellow pepper, seeded and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
6 whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 pound whole-wheat spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
Cut zucchini into 1/4-inch-thick strips 2 to 3 inches long. Heat 2 tablespoons 
olive oil in skillet and saute zucchini over medium-low heat until tender but 
still crisp. If necessary, add more oil to prevent burning. Transfer zucchini 
and remaining oil in pan to shallow baking dish. 
</P>
<P>
Add olive oil to skillet, add onions and yellow pepper strips and cook, 
stirring, over medium heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add onions and 
their juices and yellow pepper strips to zucchini, tossing lightly to mix. 
</P>
<P>
In small saucepan, combine vinegar, water, cloves and fennel seeds. Bring to 
boil, reduce heat and simmer 3 minutes. Pour over zucchini and onion mixture. 
Add oregano and basil leaves, cover tightly and marinate at least 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
Just before serving, cook pasta in boiling salted water until tender. Drain and 
turn into greased serving dish. Drain zucchini and onions, reserving marinade. 
Add zucchini mixture to pasta and toss gently. Add reserved marinade to taste 
and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve grated Parmesan over each 
portion. Makes 4 to 5 servings. 
</P>
<P>
NOTE: For variety, different vegetables may be substituted for the zucchini and 
yellow pepper. Some suggestions are julienned yellow squash, red and green 
pepper strips, julienned carrot. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH PEA SOUP 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sliced green onions, green part only 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
1 quart clear chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
1 small potato, peeled and diced 
</P>
<P>
3 cups fresh shelled peas or 2 (10-ounce) packages frozen peas 
</P>
<P>
1 cup watercress leaves, not packed 
</P>
<P>
Salt, white pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 to 1/2 cup sour cream or creme fraiche, if desired 
</P>
<P>
Additional watercress sprigs for garnish 
</P>
<P>
Saute green onions in butter until limp and tender, about 2 minutes in heavy 
saucepan. Gradually add flour and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Add 
broth, cooking over medium heat until mixture thickens slightly. Add potato, 
peas and watercress, cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until vegetables are 
tender. 
</P>
<P>
Remove from heat and puree until smooth in blender container in several 
batches. Return to pan, heat through and season to taste with salt and white 
pepper. (If soup is too thick, additional chicken broth may be added to thin 
slightly.) To serve, drizzle sour cream or creme fraiche in each bowl. Makes 
about 6 servings.
