THIS MAYOR'S CANDID NATURE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: ALEX FIORE HAS BEEN A DRIVING FORCE IN THE CITY SINCE THE '60S, 
AND SOME OF HIS CRITICS HAVE HAD ENOUGH.

Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore loves to talk tough and argue with anyone who 
does not agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
A few local residents refuse to address him at City Council meetings for fear 
that he will embarrass them in public. 
</P>
<P>
"I hide nothing," said Fiore, 64, who retired in 1984 as vice president of 
finance for Rocketdyne. "It's my Italian blood, I guess. If I'm angry, you'll 
know it. If I'm happy, you'll know it. It's my style; I can't help it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is the kind of person who gets impatient at stoplights. If the cars 
do not move the instant the light turns green, he honks. He's never late for a 
meeting, and he expects others to be prompt as well. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his abrupt, abrasive style, Fiore has been elected to six terms on the 
City Council, finishing first almost every time. He's one of the founding 
fathers of the city, spearheading the incorporation movement in the early 1960s 
and helping build Thousand Oaks into what it is today. The City Council has 
appointed him mayor half a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
Although his popularity runs deep, several vocal residents say the veteran 
mayor has overstayed his welcome. A movement is afoot to oust Fiore from office 
if he decides to run for reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
Although his foes agree that it will be difficult to remove the city's eldest 
statesman, activist Dick Booker and attorney James N. Brown said several weeks 
ago that they are searching for a candidate to put up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for a change," Booker said. "He acts like he owns the place." 
</P>
<P>
Heinrich (Corky) Charles, who was fired as a city planning commissioner in 
1978, and County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer have launched bitter attacks 
against Fiore, criticizing him for his support of the controversial Jungleland 
civic center project. 
</P>
<P>
His foes are hoping that the $55.6-million project, which will include a civic 
auditorium and a new government center, will be his undoing at election time. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mayor is confident that he can survive the attacks of his critics 
-- whom he calls crackerjacks and jokers -- this city of 107,000 could be in 
for a few fiery exchanges before the battle in November. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore's involvement in local issues started shortly before the city was 
incorporated in 1964. He settled with his wife, Katie, and their three children 
in a mid-size house, which they purchased for $25,000 in an area called the 
Meadows. The neighborhood was filled with young couples and children, the 
perfect place to raise a family, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But there were problems. It was difficult to get sewer hookups. The water 
quality was poor. The foundations of some of the houses cracked because of 
shoddy workmanship permitted under lax county building codes, Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore became president of the homeowners group and began searching for ways to 
solve the problems. He and others decided that the solution was to form a city. 
</P>
<P>
The group gathered signatures, and the issue was placed on the ballot. It 
passed with about 60% of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
After incorporation, one of the first major measures Fiore introduced as a 
newly elected council member was the city's ridgeline protection ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"You can develop on the floor of the valley and enjoy looking at the hills," 
Fiore said, "or you can build around the hills but leave the floor of the 
valley alone for things like golf courses and parks and farms. 
</P>
<P>
"We had already started in that direction of developing the floor. We thought 
we should leave the ridges pure, and I think we've done that." 
</P>
<P>
Fiore also wanted to preserve the thousands of oak trees that dot the 
hillsides. In the early 1970s, he introduced the city's first measure 
protecting the majestic trees. "The easiest way to build a tract is to bulldoze 
everything," Fiore said. "We wanted the developers to work with the oaks to the 
best of their ability." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Fiore's fight to protect the trees and ridge tops, he has occasionally 
taken pro-development positions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he opposed Measure A, the residents' growth-control initiative 
approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore said he did not see the need for a growth-management ordinance, which 
allows the city to issue only 500 residential building permits a year. The 
mayor said the free market and the council could monitor the expansion without 
a law on the books. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said he didn't like the idea of being "locked into an ordinance 
that was written by neophytes." 
</P>
<P>
"Measure A left so much for interpretation," Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore has also supported several major housing developments -- including the 
MGM Ranch, Lang Ranch and Dos Vientos -- bringing criticism from some of his 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"He's too pro-development for me," said Ken Bauer, a local environmentalist who 
served on Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk's election committee. But Bauer 
said that while he does not agree with Fiore's stand on many issues, he 
believes that Fiore has served the city well. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the utmost respect for him," Bauer said. "No one is as honest and as 
forthright. I don't think there is anyone who works harder at the job than 
Alex." 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Fiore spends much of his time working on the civic center project. 
</P>
<P>
"My main objective if I run again is to oversee the completion of the 
Jungleland project," Fiore said during an interview at his home. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be spending some bucks . . . but we'll get it back and more," 
he said. "I'm trying to do what people want me to do. I get the very strong 
message that people in this community want a civic auditorium." 
</P>
<P>
But a small group of vocal residents have said Fiore and other city officials 
should never have approved the costly project. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council set a $55.6-million budget for the venture, opponents say 
the civic center will cost more than $100 million when it is completed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"Jungleland will be a burden on the city's treasury," said Schaefer, who 
recently lost her reelection bid to political novice VanderKolk. "It was 
impractical, and they should have let the people decide." Furthermore, 
Schaefer, a longtime adversary from their days on the Thousand Oaks City 
Council, said Fiore is nothing but a "schoolyard bully" who insists on having 
his way. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore dismisses the comments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny; you get people who don't live in the city and they just rave about 
it," Fiore said. "Yet you get some people in the city who think you're ruining 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Fiore is extremely sensitive to criticism about the city, and he does 
not like to leave complaints unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every day, he scans the letters to the editor in the local newspaper for 
residents grumbling about Thousand Oaks. He calls them up one by one to defend 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it seems when you read a letter that is real juicy and filled 
with erroneous impressions, they have an unlisted number and you can't get 
them," Fiore said. "That really bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
A few of the residents that Fiore reaches say they appreciate the call. A few 
argue with him for a while and then hang up. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays, he sets up a table at Janss Mall near a hamburger restaurant to 
talk with residents. Sometimes he'll just baby-sit children while parents are 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
He admits that his abrasive style sometimes hurts people's feelings, but he 
says his feelings have been hurt too. 
</P>
<P>
"When people come up and make statements like, 'You're not doing what's best 
for the city,' and you know in your heart that you are . . . you just let go," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a resident addressed the City Council about an apartment complex 
planned for his neighborhood. The resident feared that the project would 
increase traffic on his street. He said he had tried to talk to city staff 
about his concerns but was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore decided to debate the issue. "I've been here for 26 years and he's 
telling me he's been calling the city," Fiore said. "Who has he been talking 
to? I guess I was a little bit abrupt with him. I was just trying to straighten 
him out. I felt bad about it afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Humiliated, the man sat down. But he came back the next week to tell Fiore that 
he did not appreciate being berated in public. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore said he was sorry, but when the man refused to accept the apology, the 
discussion turned into another argument. The mayor asked the police chief to 
escort the man from the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Gorner, another of Fiore's adversaries, said she has not talked to the 
mayor in 20 years because of an argument they had concerning a city project. 
</P>
<P>
"He was rude and said I didn't know what I was talking about," Gorner said. 
"You can't talk to him; he won't listen." 
</P>
<P>
Grant Brimhall, Thousand Oaks' cool and methodical city manager, chuckles when 
he talks about Fiore's fiery disposition. 
</P>
<P>
"He's intense and he's very passionate," Brimhall said. "But he's anxious to do 
the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
"He has helped build Thousand Oaks from a little town of 25,000 or 30,000 to a 
world-class city. I'm sure he has made some decisions he would like to rethink. 
But look around the city; the proof is in the pudding."

QUARRY OPERATING WITHOUT A PERMIT; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLATIONS: THE GRAVEL FIRM'S AUTHORIZATION TO OPERATE EXPIRED IN LATE 1986, 
BUT IT WAITED TWO YEARS TO FILE FOR RENEWAL, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED. 
</P>

<P>
A gravel company near Moorpark with a decade-long history of violating 
quarrying regulations has operated for more than three years without a permit, 
county documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Star Ready Mix, which has raised the ire of its neighbors on Happy Camp 
Road, mines about 800,000 cubic yards of gravel a year at its quarry and 
concrete-mixing plant. The company, one of the largest of Ventura County's 30 
rock quarries, is bordered by a cluster of residences. 
</P>
<P>
The company's operating permit expired in November, 1986, and it waited two 
years to file for renewal, county officials said. The renewal has not been 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
"Their permit has technically expired," said Robert Laughlin, a county planning 
supervisor who manages the commercial and industrial land-use section. 
</P>
<P>
The number of legal and environmental studies required for Blue Star's new 
permit have caused so many delays that it "has introduced a tremendous amount 
of confusion among the agencies involved," Laughlin said. "There's a tremendous 
cloud over the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
During an inspection of the quarry in September, Planning Department officials 
found that Blue Star had expanded its operations without getting permits to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
The company built three illegal buildings, added a parking lot and opened a 
portable concrete-batch plant, documents show. 
</P>
<P>
The company also failed to file an accurate reclamation plan for land that was 
quarried, officials said. State law requires gravel companies to restore 
quarried land to its original condition. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the company has operated after allowed hours since 1980, county officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials closed Blue Star's illegal buildings and wrote the company a warning 
letter, but no other action will be taken pending a Planning Commission review 
of the violations in July, said Todd Collart, who supervises zoning and permits 
for the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Star officials say their quarry has had more than its share of scrutiny 
during the past three years because of complaints from four or five neighbors 
who live in the rural community north of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman John Newton said Blue Star "is under a tremendous 
microscope," yet inspectors have not found any serious violations. 
</P>
<P>
"The county's not having any heartburn over it," Newton said. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints against Blue Star date back to 1978, two years after it began 
operating, county records show. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1978, planning officials found that Blue Star owners needed to 
complete a reclamation plan for the quarry. Two years later, the company filed 
a plan that county officials say is still incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, inspectors found that Blue Star employees were working after the 
company's 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. operating hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Star was notified by letter dated Aug. 7, 1980, that all operations 
conducted on the site after 6 p.m. would have to be discontinued within 30 
days," said a letter addressed to Newton from Bruce Smith, then-supervisor of 
zoning and permits. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors complain that trucks continue to travel in and out of the plant 
after legal hours. 
</P>
<P>
Newton acknowledged that Blue Star has violated its operating hours in the 
past, but said "that's not the case today." 
</P>
<P>
Some trucks occasionally return after-hours because of mechanical breakdowns on 
the road or unavoidable delays at work sites, he said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say the quarry risks legal action by continuing to operate 
past 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We've maintained since the early 1980s that they're not allowed to do that," 
Collart said. 
</P>
<P>
But catching a violation has proved difficult, Collart said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't stake it out 24 hours a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if approved, a new permit may limit traffic on two-lane Happy Camp Road, 
which residents say is beyond its capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Star's original permit issued in November, 1976, indicates that traffic on 
the road would average 170 truck trips per day. 
</P>
<P>
Today, trips have increased to nearly 1,200, according to a traffic study 
conducted in April by an engineering firm hired by one of the residents. 
Residents say trucks roll past their houses nearly every half-minute, 12 hours 
a day, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
The din caused by caravans of trucks coming into and leaving Blue Star exceeds 
rural noise levels, generating as much noise as a busy city street, according 
to a 1988 California Department of Transportation study. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like standing under a roller coaster at Magic Mountain," said Tom 
Schleve, 43, who lives nearby. "It's been a strain on us emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
Excessive truck traffic caused one quarry to be closed last year. Ventura 
County supervisors revoked Somis Sand &amp; Rock's operating permit after 
residents who live on two-lane Balcom Canyon Road complained. 
</P>
<P>
Somis Sand &amp; Rock, which stopped operations in March, was a much smaller 
quarry with fewer trucks. Residents in the area say the trucks made about 300 
round trips a day. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 county public works report indicates that the high volume of truck 
traffic from Blue Star would accelerate the deterioration of Happy Camp Road by 
eight to 10 years. The trucks contribute to 61% of the traffic on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Because the company is outside Moorpark's city limits, it cannot be required to 
pay for repairs, Councilwoman Eloise Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"You could contribute $100,000 to Moorpark, and you wouldn't pay for the damage 
to roads," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the gravel company's original permit, truck traffic on Happy Camp Road is 
not limited, Blue Star's Newton said. The company runs a maximum of 500 
round-trip deliveries a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Blue Star maintain that the quarry was built before the 
neighboring houses and that residents such as Schleve exaggerate to county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Schleve, who has owned his property for nine years, moved onto it three years 
ago. Soon afterward, Schleve began to complain to county officials that the 
number of trucks had increased from the time he purchased his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been three years worth of hell," Newton said. "There are 150 jobs 
threatened because of this guy's antics." 
</P>
<P>
Schleve and his wife, Pat, said they have records to prove that they have a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The frustration is the county expects the homeowner to provide them with the 
proof," Schleve said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple became sleuths in their quest to document their problems with Blue 
Star, carrying videotape equipment during stakeouts. 
</P>
<P>
They have a library of 20 videotapes and 10 audiotapes recording Blue Star 
trucks leaving the plant before 6 a.m. and running stop signs, they said. The 
Schleves also said they videotaped Blue Star workers operating equipment at 
10:30 p.m. on a Friday. 
</P>
<P>
They hired an aerial photographer to take pictures of the Blue Star site. The 
couple spent nearly $20,000 on traffic studies and legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Schleves launched their crusade against Blue Star, they have 
persuaded other neighbors to join the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Cook, 50, a horse breeder who lives across the street from the Schleves, 
said some of the buildings on her 10-acre ranch have foundations built with 
Blue Star concrete. 
</P>
<P>
But since truck traffic began to increase, fewer riders have boarded horses at 
her Triple L Double K Ranch and business has decreased, Cook said. She plans to 
move to Arizona after selling her property. 
</P>
<P>
"This is supposed to be a rural residential area and in the last three years, 
it's turned into a commercial area," Cook said. "Moorpark is ruined for me and 
what I want to do."

LATINOS SLOWLY GAINING GROUND WITH CITY HALL; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: LA COLONIA, CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE CITY BY RAILROAD TRACKS, HAS 
BECOME THE FOCAL POINT OF A NEW ACTIVISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
La Colonia -- a gritty, working-class neighborhood in Oxnard with the city's 
highest concentration of Latinos -- shares the many typical barrio problems of 
gangs, drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
Residents complain of too few police patrols, poorly maintained roads and no 
place but the streets for youngsters to spend their afternoons. These problems, 
they say, are part of a larger issue: the Latino community's difficulty in 
getting the attention of Oxnard City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
But that appears to be changing in the neighborhood that needs the most 
attention. La Colonia, cut off from the rest of the city by railroad tracks, 
has become the focal point of a new Latino activism that organizers say may 
ultimately change the complexion of city politics. 
</P>
<P>
Since April, 1989, the number of participants in La Colonia's neighborhood 
council has jumped from about 20 to more than 100. "We are struggling but we 
are coming along little by little," said Ignacio Carmona, former vice chairman 
of La Colonia's neighborhood council. 
</P>
<P>
Proving that there is power in numbers, La Colonia residents have since started 
to feel that City Hall is paying more attention to their concerns, Carmona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said Police Chief Robert Owens recently met with the council to 
talk about crime in the neighborhood, and Assemblyman Jack O'Connell lobbied 
for and won a $450,000 state grant to build a youth gym in La Colonia. The 
Oxnard Public Works Department recently solved a longtime parking problem that 
caused congestion in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We had issues that needed to be taken care of," Carmona said. "But I guess it 
was just the case of the wheel that squeaks the loudest gets the oil." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 35 active neighborhood councils in Oxnard, said Eleanor 
Branthoover, chairwoman of the Inter Neighborhood Council Committee. The 
grass-roots organization is designed to give residents a coordinated way to 
express their concerns to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is impressed by the number of residents who now show up at La 
Colonia's neighborhood council meetings. "That's a really good turnout," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city began encouraging Latino activism after La Colonia residents asked the 
City Council for more representation and better city services. City officials 
assigned the job of encouraging Latino representation to Karl Lawson, a 
community relations specialist who worked for the United Farm Workers Union for 
11 years before he was hired by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, who said he learned Spanish on the streets of Oxnard, organized a 
door-to-door campaign to encourage Latino participation and promoted the 
neighborhood council in ads in newspapers and on Spanish-language radio 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
However, Latino advocates and city officials believe Latino representation in 
Oxnard is still inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a first step," said Marco Antonio Abarca, an attorney for the 
California Rural League Assistance in Oxnard. "It's really a modest step if you 
think about it. But at least it's a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Abarca pointed out that more than half of Oxnard's population is Latino, yet 
only one City Council post is occupied by a Latino. Last year, when the council 
appointed 22 citizens to an economic advisory committee it selected only three 
Latinos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We make a pretense of being a democracy, but democracy means the 
representation of every person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi said he sees the growth of La Colonia's neighborhood council 
as a good sign, but he agrees that much more needs to be done to establish fair 
Latino representation in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want any part of the city to feel neglected or cut out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said La Colonia -- a neighborhood of mostly older, single-family homes 
in the northeast section of Oxnard -- is physically cut off from the rest of 
the city by the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said he believes the tracks not only form a physical barrier for the 
residents, but a psychological one as well. 
</P>
<P>
During his last campaign effort, Takasugi talked to many residents in La 
Colonia who, he said, "feel they have been cut off from the rest of the city." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, he said, residents have complained about deteriorating 
streets, old and leaky pipes and problems with utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Manuel Lopez, the third Latino elected to the council since the city 
was incorporated in 1903, said the problem of Latino under-representation is 
not unique to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous under-representation in all governments," he said. "A 
lot of strides have been made, but not enough." 
</P>
<P>
He said part of the problem is getting Latinos to believe their voices can make 
a difference. "I think they feel alienated; they feel there is nothing they can 
do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez attributes the feeling of powerlessness partly to racism. For example, 
Lopez said, when he ran for the mayor's seat two years ago, representatives of 
one of his opponents asked voters if they would be ready to have a "Mexican 
mayor." 
</P>
<P>
"People are always looking for reasons not to grant the people their rights," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez predicts that Latino representation on the City Council will not change 
significantly until the city is required by a court decision to elect council 
members by district. Considering recent court decisions involving redistricting 
in Watsonville and Los Angeles, Lopez said district elections may come sooner 
than most anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no such court challenge has been filed. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, a citizens group tried unsuccessfully to gather enough 
signatures to challenge the city's at-large election system, which is accused 
of diluting minority voting strength. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert G. Breezley, an Oxnard paralegal who had headed the Council District 
Initiative Committee, said the group gathered about 3,000 signatures, short of 
the 7,300 needed to put a measure on the ballot that would carve the city into 
six council districts. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure, if approved, would have gradually replaced all of Oxnard's 
four council members, who live in the same predominantly white, upscale 
neighborhood, with six council members from districts of about equal population 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Breezley said the signature drive failed partly because of opposition from 
incumbent council members. 
</P>
<P>
But he has not given up. Breezley is now considering a petition that seeks 
approval of a 15-member city charter commission, which would be asked to draft 
new guidelines for city elections. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines could include district elections as well as the election of a 
full-time mayor who would act as the city's top administrator, Breezley said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and a committee of 40 residents would begin circulating the petition 
within two months. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very good about it," Breezley said.

<P>
COURTHOUSE COSTS TO EXCEED ESTIMATE

<P>
The interior of the East County Courthouse in Simi Valley will cost Ventura 
County $600,000 more to build than originally estimated, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost for the interior of the two-story, 76,800-square-foot 
building is now $7.8 million, about 8% higher than the original estimate of 
$7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The shell of the building was completed last year within budget, at a cost of 
$2,560,767, Ventura County Public Works Agency Director Art Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
The interior is scheduled to be completed in December. It will cost more to 
build the interior of the building than estimated in part because plans for it 
were modified and there was a lack of communication between the architect and 
the county Public Works Agency, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
"The engineer's estimate was just totally wrong and way too low," County 
Supervisor James R. Dougherty said. "We added a lot of things" to the project 
after the initial plans were completed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially we were just planning on carrying out non-jury trials," including 
civil and traffic court cases, said Goulet, who prepared a report on the 
project's cost overruns for Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are so many court cases in the county that officials decided 
that the East County facility should be outfitted to hold jury trials as well, 
Goulet said. Jury boxes were added in three of the five courtrooms, as well as 
jury assembly and deliberation rooms with restroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
With a wider variety of cases being heard, plans for the court's holding 
facility had to be modified to isolate juveniles and inmates who commit less 
serious crimes from hard-core criminals, the report states. Instead of two 
large rooms for men and women, Sheriff's Department officials asked for two 
large and four small cells with security glass and doors. 
</P>
<P>
Several other changes have been made in the interior building plans, including 
energy-saving lighting, heating and air-conditioning systems, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
Goulet blames the architect, Rasmussen and Associates of Ventura, for failing 
to submit periodic cost statements. However, the Public Works Agency should 
have required the company to turn in such statements, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty secured funding in April for the project, even with cost overruns. 
After the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. accused Dougherty and the Board of 
Supervisors of irresponsible spending on the project, the board approved the 
purchase of $300 seats for the courtrooms, instead of the $500 seats originally 
planned. The supervisors are considering the use of plastic laminates rather 
than more expensive wood for cabinets in the building, said John Spilman, a 
spokesman for Dougherty's office. KIM KASH

</P>
<P>
ZONING: THE SIERRA CLUB AND LAS VIRGENES HOMEOWNERS SAY PROFITABILITY STUDIES 
WERE MANIPULATED TO SECURE COUNTY APPROVAL TO ALLOW MORE HOUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of the Paramount Ranch development in Agoura falsified a financial 
analysis to win county approval of a zoning change that would allow 
construction of more luxury houses, according to documents in a lawsuit seeking 
to nullify the approval. 
</P>
<P>
When initial calculations showed that the project would make a profit under 
various designs the proponents did not want to pursue, they inflated the land 
cost so only the project they were pushing would appear financially viable, 
court papers charge. 
</P>
<P>
The first calculations never saw the light of day, while the second version -- 
described as a "sophisticated financial study" -- was submitted to Los Angeles 
County supervisors in December, 1988. The supervisors later agreed to "upzone" 
the property to permit more houses, accepting the study as part of the legal 
justification. 
</P>
<P>
Depositions in the lawsuit also show that while proponents of the project were 
repeatedly telling parks agencies that they were not willing to sell the land, 
they in fact secretly did sell it to a private firm for considerably less than 
parks officials were willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the financial study and the secret sale of the land are contained in 
court papers filed on behalf of the Sierra Club and Las Virgenes Homeowners 
Federation, whose lawsuit against the county is scheduled for trial June 28. 
They are seeking to void the county's decision to permit 150 houses to be built 
on the hilly, oak-dotted property, which parks agencies had eagerly sought to 
buy for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Construction on 
the project has not begun. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in September, contends that the county violated the 
California Environmental Quality Act by transferring responsibility for a 
thorough environmental review to the developers themselves. The purportedly 
rigged financial analysis, the plaintiffs contend, is but one example of how 
the county rubber-stamped the work of the Paramount Ranch developers' 
hand-picked consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what happens when the county delegates preparation of what are 
supposed to be objective, neutral analyses to consultants who are paid by the 
project applicant," said Ann Carlson, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys. The 
county "just went on blind faith and accepted the developer's contentions that 
all these other projects were unfeasible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental quality law requires an objective environmental impact report 
for major development projects. A planning agency may draft the report itself, 
farm it out to consultants or allow the developer to prepare it with 
consultants of his own choice. However, in such cases, the county must 
independently review the work and certify that it is adequate. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities and counties hire consultants themselves, billing the developers, 
but Los Angeles County allows developers to hire and manage the consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the Paramount Ranch consultants were 
more interested in winning approval than in assessing the project, even to the 
point of lobbying the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
But in response to the suit, attorneys for the county and the developers argue 
that county officials at every step independently reviewed the consultants' 
work. As a result, they say, county approval of the project was entirely legal. 
The lawsuit, they contend, is an attempt to block the project so the land can 
be bought for the national recreation area at "a bargain price." 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs' attorneys investigated the origin of the financial study through 
depositions and documents obtained from the developers and their consultants. 
This pretrial discovery also revealed that, prior to approval, the project 
underwent a change of ownership that was not revealed to county supervisors, 
parks officials and other interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
The 320-acre site at Cornell Road north of Mulholland Highway is part of the 
historic movie ranch where many Paramount Westerns were filmed. For years, the 
owner was retired businessman Arthur Whizin, who formed a joint venture with 
developer Brian Heller to build luxury houses on the site. 
</P>
<P>
But the property also was high on the list of the National Park Service, which 
wanted to buy it as an addition to the national recreation area -- the loose 
network of parks and trails stretching from Griffith Park in Los Angeles to 
Point Mugu State Park in Ventura County. Officials wanted to preserve the land 
for its own sake and to protect the adjacent 436 acres of the old movie ranch 
that the park service already owned. 
</P>
<P>
Under county zoning, no more than 103 houses could be built on the land. But 
the developers hired an engineer who concluded that the limit was based on 
inaccurate slope data, and that there was enough flat land to build more 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
Park advocates, including members of Southern California's congressional 
delegation, urged the county to stick to the existing zoning and approve no 
more than 103 houses. Otherwise, they said, the land might be priced out of 
reach of the public. But in August, 1988, the county Regional Planning 
Commission approved a zoning change to permit 159 houses. 
</P>
<P>
The battle then came before the supervisors, who were under strong pressure 
from park supporters to deny the upzoning. Heller had contended all along that 
a smaller project would not be financially feasible. But a key court ruling in 
another case held that such claims must be supported by evidence or the 
approval could be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing before the supervisors on Dec. 15, 1988, Heller submitted the 
"sophisticated financial study" that showed he needed 159 units. The analysis, 
done for Heller by Economics Research Associates, was accepted by the county 
for inclusion in the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently unknown to everyone else at the hearing, Heller and Whizin had 
agreed earlier in the year to sell the project for $13.5 million to Paramount 
Ranch Estates, a firm headed by Northridge developer Ezra Raiten, according to 
sale documents filed as exhibits in the lawsuit. When Heller hired Economics 
Research for the financial analysis, he had the firm base its calculations on a 
land investment cost of $14 million -- close to what Raiten was about to pay, 
according to depositions in the case. 
</P>
<P>
However, when the analysis showed alternative project designs -- such as 
clustering the houses or building fewer of them -- would also be profitable, 
Heller had the analysis redone. This time, he had the consultants use a land 
investment cost of $17.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
With this key assumption changed, the 159-unit plan alone was shown to be 
financially viable. Only this version was submitted to the county. 
</P>
<P>
When Heller's deposition was taken April 9, he was asked where the 
$17.5-million figure came from. "My recollection is that I pulled $17 million 
out of the air," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Heller and attorneys for the county have defended the change on grounds that 
the land was worth considerably more than $17.5 million. Since that is closer 
to its value than $14 million, they say, the change produced a more realistic 
study. 
</P>
<P>
However, the study identifies the $17.5 million as the investment in the land, 
not on the property's estimated market value. 
</P>
<P>
During the Dec. 15, 1988, hearing, Heller was also asked about efforts by the 
park service and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to buy the property. As 
he had in the past and would in the future, Heller said: "I am not a willing 
seller." 
</P>
<P>
But the following day, when the sale became final, Heller had nothing to sell. 
The sales agreement, now an exhibit in the case, called for Heller to serve for 
a year as part-time consultant to Paramount Ranch Estates at $6,500 per month. 
Heller would continue to seek development approvals and would allow his name to 
be used to "facilitate" them. 
</P>
<P>
Following the sale, however, Heller continued to speak for the project and 
apparently no one knew that he was no longer the owner. He referred to 
Paramount Ranch as "my project," including in a January, 1989, letter to 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, whose district includes the site. 
</P>
<P>
The next month, after completing an appraisal, the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy made a formal offer to Heller of $21 million for the property. In 
April, 1989, after supervisors had approved the project with 150 houses, the 
conservancy made another offer -- this time of $19.3 million to reflect the 
loss of nine lots. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, said he knew nothing 
of the sale to Raiten. "The whole farce of it is that all these letters are 
being sent to people who don't own the property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston also said he was surprised that Heller and Whizin had sold to a 
private party "for an amount that we would have cut a check for the next day." 
</P>
<P>
Both Heller and Whizin are longtime Antonovich contributors. Yet an Antonovich 
aide told The Times that "Mike was unaware of the change of ownership of the 
property" until called about it last week. 
</P>
<P>
Heller's continuing pretense of owning the project may have helped get it 
approved, based on his reputation as a builder. The project was heavily 
opposed, but some residents said they supported it, citing the quality of 
Heller's work. Had they known that he had sold his interest, they might not 
have spoken up. 
</P>
<P>
Raiten's past legal scrapes might have been a liability in such a bitter 
development battle. In 1983, the 38-year-old developer served a five-month 
state prison sentence in Chino after pleading guilty to writing bad checks. In 
1986, he pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon after trying to run 
down his mother-in-law and her boyfriend in a car. He was placed on three years 
probation and fined $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Heller and Raiten would not say why they kept the sale to themselves. 
"There really wasn't a good reason" to disclose the change in ownership, Heller 
said. "Regardless of who does it, it's a beautiful project." 
</P>
<P>
Raiten wouldn't discuss it. "Look, I don't have time to talk to you right now," 
he said when asked to comment. "Write whatever you want," and he hung up the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs have introduced exhibits purporting to show that consultants who 
worked on the environmental impact report saw their main job as getting the 
project approved. Among other things, the documents appear to show that 
consultants spent part of their time trying to influence the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"Tickets for Antonovich event. Set meeting w/Mike -- clear the air for Mike's 
comfort level," one hand-written note said. "What can we do to help Mike's 
campaign?" another memo asked. 
</P>
<P>
A third said, "Goals: Ensure both politically and ethically majority of 
supervisors can support" Paramount Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
These notes were culled from the files of Engineering Technology, which served 
as "expediter" for Paramount Ranch and also prepared a formal response to 
comments, a document that is part of the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy M. Brogin, a former senior planner at Engineering Technology who served 
as project manager for Paramount Ranch, denied that the firm saw its role as 
getting permits for its client. In her deposition in April, Brogin testified: 
"My ethics are to provide an objective view of the project to the 
decision-maker." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Engineering Technology kept an eye on the political scene. In November, 
1988, according to one document, it sent Heller a list of political 
contributors to supervisors other than Antonovich. "Please review names to see 
if you know any major contributors to urge them to contact" the supervisors, 
the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The project was approved by the supervisors in March, 1989, on a 3-1 vote, with 
only Supervisor Ed Edelman voting not to upzone the tract. After ratcheting 
down the project from 159 to 150 units, Antonovich voted for it, and 
Supervisors Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum followed his lead. 
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1989, the supervisors received at least $36,995 in campaign 
contributions from officials and consultants involved in Paramount Ranch -- of 
which $29,495, or more than three-fourths, went to Antonovich, according to 
campaign reports. 
</P>
<P>
Engineering Technology, which also has many other clients with business before 
the county, led the way with contributions of $20,600 to the supervisors. Art 
Whizin, Brian Heller and Heller Construction contributed $10,795, all of it to 
Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
In March and April, 1989, Raiten and his Raiten Development, which previously 
had not given to supervisorial campaigns, contributed $1,000 to Antonovich, 
$2,000 to Dana and $1,600 to Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich, Dana and Schabarum have repeatedly said campaign donations don't 
influence their votes. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich contributors "are contributing to his philosophy and to his program 
for what he considers to be good government," said his press deputy, Dawson 
Oppenheimer. "They aren't buying a damn thing."

AIRPORT NOISE REDUCTION HASN'T STOPPED THE CLAMOR; 
</P>
<P>
DISPUTE: BURBANK AIRPORT OFFICIALS SAY STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE NOISE 
'FOOTPRINT' AND COMPLAINTS ARE BOTH DIMINISHING. NEARBY HOMEOWNERS CONTEND THAT 
THE REAL ISSUE IS THE NUMBER OF TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS, WHICH HAVE DOUBLED SINCE 
1978. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unfriendly minuet that has been repeated many times in recent years, 
Burbank Airport has released statistics showing that it is generating less 
noise, only to have homeowner group leaders scoff at the data and counter that 
the noise is actually worse. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same give-and-take that has raged intermittently since 1978, when the 
cities of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena bought the aging facility from 
Lockheed Corp. and promised that the airport would become a good neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials, saying they have kept that promise, this month marshaled 
pages of computer-generated statistics and several noise "footprint" maps to 
prove their case. 
</P>
<P>
The information had been routinely published by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena 
Airport Authority in quarterly reports to its governing board, but was never 
before assembled to cover the entire span of the airport's public ownership, 
spokesman Victor Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
"What the chart showed remarkably to us, and what we wanted to point out to the 
commissioners, was just how far they really have come," Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
"Noise is down, and complaints are down," said Robert Garcin, president of the 
nine-member airport commission. "We are in harmony with the neighborhood, 
except for a handful who continue to complain." 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing but a big lie," said Tom Paterson of North Hollywood, chairman of the 
East Valley Airport Communities Coalition, an anti-noise group formed by nine 
homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport is close to twice as noisy as it was in 1978," said Richard Close, 
president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., who has been attacking airport 
noise since the mid-1970s. "They have broken every promise." 
</P>
<P>
As before, the latest dispute centers on a little-known method of noise 
measurement known as the CNEL -- the Community Noise Equivalent Level. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials call the CNEL a valuable tool for measuring the noise burden 
around the airport, but noise protesters call it a "public relations tool" and 
"totally irrelevant" to what residents experience under the flight paths. 
</P>
<P>
All airports are mandated by the state Legislature to produce CNEL 
measurements, which are based on decibel readings of noise. Burbank Airport 
records noise at 15 listening stations around the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The readings are added together and averaged over a 24-hour period under a 
formula that gives a greater weight to evening and night noise than to daytime 
noise on the theory that jet roar at night is a greater nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically, the daily averages are added and averaged, and the resulting 
averages are used to draw imaginary lines around the airport on a map. These 
lines define noise contours, called "footprints." 
</P>
<P>
The 65 CNEL footprint, for instance, encloses the area in which all the average 
readings are 65 decibels or higher. 
</P>
<P>
When the authority bought the airport 12 years ago, airports in California were 
prohibited from generating noise above 70 CNEL in areas containing homes and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the standard was tightened to 65 CNEL. Like most airports, Burbank has 
never met either standard. 
</P>
<P>
But the state's bite is nothing like its bark; the state Department of 
Transportation regularly gives airports waivers to continue operating after 
conducting lengthy hearings to determine if a good-faith effort is being made 
to meet the noise standard. 
</P>
<P>
And the CNEL maps indicate that the authority is indeed doing something about 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
Garcin noted that the size of the area containing residences and schools in 
which 70 CNEL is not met has dropped from 407 acres in 1978 to 22 acres this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
And telephoned complaints to the authority have also "dropped dramatically," 
Garcin said, from 2,200 calls in 1985 to 318 calls in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying that the airport does not generate noise," he said. "But 
things have improved." 
</P>
<P>
Airport staff members say the shrinking of the noise contour results chiefly 
from the introduction of quieter Stage Three jets, a process that was completed 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank was the first airport in the nation to ban aircraft not built or 
retrofitted to meet Stage Three criteria, the toughest standards now available. 
</P>
<P>
The shrinkage of the 65 CNEL area has been steady but substantially slower than 
the 70 CNEL area cited by Garcin, according to an authority report. 
</P>
<P>
Close, however, contends that CNEL maps are "totally irrelevant. They make 
sense only to a computer. The real issue is the number of interruptions." 
</P>
<P>
Close noted that next month, when USAir is scheduled to add seven flights at 
the airport, the number of daily flights -- each accounting for one landing and 
one takeoff -- interrupting neighborhoods north, south and west of the airport 
will be double the number in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, planes have become somewhat quieter as a result of 
prodding by the Federal Aviation Administration, Close said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fact that each plane is slightly less noisy is unimportant compared to 
a doubling of the number of flights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every commercial jet disturbs residents in a wide section of the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
In response to the authority's oft-repeated challenge to suggest a better 
measure of noise than the CNEL, Close and others say they want to limit the 
airport to a maximum number of flights each day that generate noise above a 
yet-to-be-determined level. 
</P>
<P>
As for the drop in telephoned complaints, Close said, "Everyone has finally 
come to the conclusion that it's a waste of time to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport authority does not listen to local congressmen, to the L. A. City 
Council, to state legislators," he said, listing some of the officials who have 
battled to lower noise from the airport. "So why would they listen to a 
resident?" 
</P>
<P>
In rebuttal to what he termed "the authority's latest public relations barrage 
about lowering noise," Paterson has studied the latest noise report and issued 
a counter-report. 
</P>
<P>
Noise contour maps issued by the authority show that the average noise level at 
a station near Burbank Boulevard, 1 1/2 miles south of the airport, is less 
than at a station on Pacific Avenue, one-quarter of a mile south of the runway, 
Paterson noted. 
</P>
<P>
But Paterson found numerous instances in the authority's data when the same jet 
generated a higher decibel level -- usually in the 95- to 100-decibel range -- 
at Burbank Boulevard than at Pacific Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"These instances we have found show that the CNEL method masks rather than 
illuminates the intensity of a single takeoff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials admit that noise readings will yield such anomalies, but 
insist that the CNEL is the best method of taking into account the variety of 
factors affecting noise impact on the ground, including wind and slight 
variations in flight pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not perfect, and I know it creates confusion," Garcin said. "But over the 
years, I have yet to hear anything suggested that is better." 
</P>
<P>
"From the airport's point of view, the CNEL is a wondrous thing," Close said.

$6-MILLION FIRE WAS SECOND TO HIT COMPLEX IN LANCASTER; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: A GARAGE WAS DAMAGED AT MARBELLA VILLAS ON JUNE 6. SATURDAY'S 
BLAZE LEFT 80 CONDOMINIUMS IN RUINS.

<TEXT>
<P>
A huge blaze that damaged or destroyed about 80 condominiums under construction 
in Lancaster Saturday, one of the Antelope Valley's biggest fires in recent 
memory, was the second suspicious fire at the 9.5-acre site in two weeks, 
authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Arson is suspected in a small June 6 fire, which caused an estimated $5,000 in 
damage to a condominium garage. Investigators identified scarring caused by 
flammable liquids on the concrete floor, said Capt. James R. Nelson of the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department, whose fire station responded to the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's fire, which caused an estimated $6 million in damage to the 127-unit 
Marbella Villas townhouses, was under investigation Sunday by arson specialists 
for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy Barney Villa, of the arson and explosives bureau, said "based 
on the fact of the previous fire" investigators suspect that Saturday's fire 
may have been deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
Villa said investigators have not yet determined the cause of the Saturday 
blaze, at 30th Street West and Avenue K-4. 
</P>
<P>
The status of the June 6 fire investigation was unavailable Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the developer said the company was aware that arson was 
suspected in the June 6 fire, but did not yet know whether it was connected to 
Saturday's blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"We're leaving the investigation to the authorities," said Peter Klaiber, vice 
president of the Hamdan Project Development Corp. of Century City. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday blaze erupted at 2:45 p.m., drawing about 250 county firefighters 
from as far away as La Crescenta and south-central Los Angeles County. Three 
water-dropping helicopters also responded. Two-mile-high plumes of smoke drew 
hundreds of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Six firefighters were treated for minor injuries and released from Antelope 
Valley Hospital Medical Center, said Battalion Chief Robert Mazzocco. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzocco said the fire's rapid spread through 20 two-story buildings also 
contributed to suspicions of arson. He said, however, that 25- to 30-m.p.h. 
winds fanned the fire, hampering firefighters' efforts. It took about 90 
minutes to control the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The fire razed 20 of the complex's 34 multiunit buildings, authorities said. 
The damaged structures were in the wood-frame phase of construction, which made 
them particularly vulnerable to fire, said Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like setting a fire in a fireplace with a lot of kindling," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the June 6 fire at Marbella Villas did not spread as quickly 
because the unit in which it occurred was already plastered. He said a security 
guard reported the fire, which left discoloration and buckling of the garage's 
cement floor, indicating that a flammable liquid was used. 
</P>
<P>
Klaiber said the garage damaged in the earlier fire was not among the 
structures burned Saturday. Company officials will begin assessing the extent 
of the destruction today. About 50 of the complex's 127 units were being sold, 
he said.

THE FAITHS MUST UNITE TO PRESS A VISION OF PEACE; 
</P>
<P>
JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS MUST CALL FOR CONCILIATION AND COMPROMISE ALONG 
THE PATH OF AN EMERGING CONSENSUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The following article was written by Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, Father Theodore 
M. Hesburgh, Rev. Charles A. Kimball and Cherif Sedky. All are members of the 
board of directors of the U.S. Interreligious Committee for Peace in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when there is a strong temptation for the United States to back away 
from involvement in pursuit of peace in the Middle East, it is essential for us 
as American Jews, Christians and Muslims to reassert the urgency for an active 
and sustained U.S. initiative 
</P>
<P>
Recent events in the Middle East -- the massacre of seven Palestinian workers 
near Tel Aviv, the killing of at least 20 Palestinians and the wounding of 
hundreds of others by Israeli soldiers responding to a resurgence of the 
intifada and the attempted Palestinian speedboat attack -- reveal the imminent 
danger of much greater violence in the Arab-Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
despite signs that negotiated peace is more possible now than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Reactions among Americans with close ties to people on both sides of the 
conflict reveal how easy it is to revert to the politics of frustration and 
confrontation despite a shared sense that a new approach is needed. For many 
Arab-Americans, the attacks on Palestinians reinforced the most negative images 
of Israelis as totally unwilling to recognize the Palestinian people, end the 
occupation and accept a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. For 
many Jewish-Americans, the failed beachfront raid by a faction of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization reinforced the idea that Palestinians can never be 
trusted and will never accept Israel's existence. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, one hears calls for the United States to cut aid to Israel or to 
break off the dialogue with the PLO. While understandable in the context of the 
fears and frustrations felt by partisans of each side, these demands are not 
likely to contribute to a more constructive U.S. policy or to peace in the 
Middle East. We fear that such demands will only exacerbate ethnic and 
religious tensions in our society. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed now is not more politics of frustration and confrontation, but a 
new politics of conciliation and compromise. It is absolutely essential and 
urgent that American Jews, Christians and Muslims meet together in dialogue, 
not merely to make us feel better but to build a common vision of Middle East 
peace on which we can unite and urge the Bush Administration and Congress to 
support. 
</P>
<P>
A common vision of peace is possible today. Indeed, the main elements already 
are agreed upon by many important Israelis and Palestinians. According to 
public opinion polls, a substantial majority of Americans supports this vision. 
Key principles of this emerging consensus include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Israel's right to secure borders and peace, based on the Jewish people's 
right of self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Palestinian people's right of self-determination, including their right 
to an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, with adequate security 
arrangements for Israel and all states in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negotiations based on U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, 
involving all parties to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.S.-Soviet cooperation to develop an international framework, process and 
guarantees for a negotiated peace. 
</P>
<P>
It is time for U.S. leaders not only to emphasize the urgent need for 
negotiations, as Secretary of State James A. Baker III effectively did last 
week, but also to publicly support these principles as the only realistic basis 
for peace. For the United States to do less at this point is to leave the field 
to those who foolishly choose the risks of trying to maintain the status quo 
over the risks of pursuing peace and, in doing so, prepare the ground for 
escalating acts of violence and the next, even more dangerous and devastating 
Arab-Israeli war. 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentally, there will be peace in the Middle East when the parties 
themselves agree to make peace. At the same time, Arab and Israeli leaders who 
seek peace agree that outside help, especially from the United States, is 
essential. 
</P>
<P>
Our role as American Jews, Christians and Muslims who believe peace is a moral 
imperative of our common Abrahamic faith is to work together to create the 
climate of urgency and the political space in this country for the United 
States to develop a much more active and sustained policy for peace in the 
Middle East.

FIERCE EYES SHATTER THE DREAM;

AMERICAN JEWS SEE ISRAEL THROUGH A ROSY MYTHOLOGY; ANGRY PALESTINIAN FACES HAVE 
NO PLACE IN THIS HAPPY PORTRAIT.

What do you wear to an uprising, I wondered, when I met Roula Abed Dehouh while 
visiting Palestinian women at Tel Mond, an Israeli prison for security 
offenders. She was tapping her foot on the gray floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I killed a Jew," Roula told me. Twenty-five years old, like me, she was 
going to sit on that cement bench for another 25 years. "I am not sorry for 
what I did, I killed for my people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes were steady. My eyes fell to her feet. I had expected that this would 
be a routine interview for a news feature. But my neck felt hot and my face, I 
imagined, betrayed my sense of Jewishness. 
</P>
<P>
Then I spotted the label. Roula was wearing Reeboks. Pink Reeboks. 
</P>
<P>
Roula kept talking: "I smuggled the gun into Jerusalem and gave it to my 
comrade." And I was thinking: What was someone like her doing wearing our 
trendy sneakers in the first place? "We are proud to be Palestinian women 
fighting for nationhood," she said, and I pictured an army of women, marching 
in pink shoes. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't help it. All the while she spoke about blood, death and 
self-determination, I was concentrating on her pink leather Reeboks. Pink 
clashes with red, I concluded; it's a bad color for an uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Why was I so ridiculous? Why couldn't I meet Roula's fierce eyes? I wouldn't 
look at her and I didn't want to listen to her rage. Like many American Jews 
who grew up after Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, I find 
it easier to latch onto labels, to concentrate on glossy appearances rather 
than on the nuanced reality of Israel's occupation of those lands. 
</P>
<P>
Angry Palestinian faces have no place in the happy portrait of Israel we grew 
up admiring. Our parents rocked us to sleep with dreamy stories of a tiny and 
brave Jewish state: Israeli heroes winning with one rifle to every hundred Arab 
cannons. 
</P>
<P>
We sleepwalked through Israel on teen tours, nudged from historical site to 
modern kibbutz, never encountering a single refugee camp. And somewhere, 
drifting through the fairy tale, we came to understand that this good little 
Israel meant that we, too, were good. 
</P>
<P>
Along came the intifada with its prime-time death footage. Many young American 
Jews, like their parents, just slumped into their couches and complained about 
the biased news media. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the chatter I hear focuses on Israel's image, not on Israel's actions. 
When a rabid Israeli lined up seven Palestinian men and shot them dead, my 
friends' response was: How will they label Israel now? Over dinner, a fretful 
discussion followed about how the press uses active verbs to describe 
Palestinian deaths but only weak passive verbs to report Israeli casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to them, I couldn't help noticing that as the image of the Israel 
they love clashed with the uncomfortable reality, my friends were retreating 
deeper into the irrelevant. Just as I had in the Tel Mond prison, they sought 
distraction in the superficial. Their adrenalin soars over newspaper grammar, 
but the daily "ings," as in clubbings, gassings, jailings, shootings, pass 
unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
We have got to wake up. We're lost somewhere in our parents' bedtime stories. 
If they want to ignore Israel's wrongs and blame distorted press coverage, at 
least they have an excuse for their nearsightedness. Our parents' generation 
grew up during the most precarious time in Jewish history. But our experience 
has been one of pride in a large, strong Jewish state -- strong enough to 
withstand a little criticism. 
</P>
<P>
One can admit that Israel's policies in the territories are wrong and still be 
a good Jew. In fact, we had better open our mouths soon, or we may find that 
Israel's finer qualities, the ones that used to prop up our small chins, just 
might disappear altogether. 
</P>
<P>
We first must find the courage to venture beneath Israel's surface. Drop the 
neat Palestinian-equals-terrorist image and examine the frightening, messy 
reality. If we want to stop pink-sneakered young women from shooting Jews, 
we'll have to wrench our averted eyes from the safe superficialities. If we 
truly want to stop the violence, we're going to have to listen to the story in 
Roula's flashing eyes.

SHAMIR AND HIS NEW CREW: HARDLY LOOSE CANNONS; 
</P>
<P>
FEARS OF EXTREMISM ARE EXAGGERATED. THIS ECLECTIC MIX HONORS WESTERN VALUES AND 
IS STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOV AHARONI, Rabbi Dov Aharoni is Los Angeles president of Americans for a 
Safe Israel and former director of Herut Zionists of America, Likud's major 
U.S. support group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Israeli government led by the Likud Party's Yitzhak Shamir fell in 
March after a parliamentary vote of noconfidence, the Bush Administration could 
barely suppress its glee, anticipating that opposition leader Shimon Peres 
would convert his majority in the Knesset into a pliable government led by the 
Labor Party. Early reports predicted the end of Shamir's career and Peres' 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Americans unfortunately do not understand Israeli politics. If they did, 
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III would have been far 
more circumspect in their earlier criticisms of Shamir. Small blocs are always 
trying to bring down Israeli governments in the hope that they will be able to 
leverage greater power in the new constellation that emerges from the ashes. 
The religious parties, in fact, are now in just such a position. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't always been so. In November, 1988, the religious parties overplayed 
their hands when, perceiving their capacity to hand Shamir a parliamentary 
majority without the participation of the Labor Party, they demanded new 
religious legislation that exceeded the secular majority's tolerance level. 
Shamir then had to ally with Peres. 
</P>
<P>
But when Bush and Baker drove the Israeli government into chaos three months 
ago with their terms for promoting Israeli-Palestinian talks, the religious 
groups saw a new opportunity: They could join Peres in bringing down the 
"unity" governent and then negotiate with Shamir, knowing his bottom line from 
the outset. 
</P>
<P>
The government that has emerged will not be marked by the religious extremism 
feared by its critics. The religious parties, now cognizant of Shamir's limits, 
withdrew a number of the demands they had put forth 20 months ago. They will 
get five ministries, three of which (Religious Affairs, Interior, and 
Education) they have held before. A fourth, Absorption, will simply work to 
integrate new Soviet immigrants into Israeli society. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's government, contrary to his opponents' worst fears, actually offers 
the best possible opportunity to move forward on the panoply of major issues 
that link the United States and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the religious dimension of Israel's new government has been exaggerated 
by its critics, so has the "right-wing" factor. Yuval Neeman, the new minister 
of Science and Energy, is universally recognized as the nation's leader in the 
field. While his Tehiya party does advocate annexing Judea and Samaria, more 
commonly known as the West Bank and Gaza, it has been flexible enough to sit in 
coalitions with Labor. And Ariel Sharon, who lobbied aggressively for the 
defense portfolio, was forced to settle for the housing ministry; defense will 
be in the hands of Moshe Arens, the outgoing foreign minister and former 
ambassador to the United States. Arens is known as both a pragmatist and a 
technocrat with American-bred values. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly little attention has been paid to Shamir's naming of David Levy as 
foreign minister. Levy is a charismatic figure in Israel's majority Sephardic 
community, which is rooted in North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
He is Israel's first foreign minister to speak little English and Americans 
know little about him. He is fluent in Arabic and French; both languages are 
likely to prove important in relations with the Arabs surrounding Israel. Those 
who have followed his career recognize that Levy is the Likud's least 
ideological leader. 
</P>
<P>
In all, it is an eclectic mix -- balancing ideologues with pragmatists and 
religionists with secularists. Americans will be pleased that Israel, which has 
become the last Western outpost of economic socialism, will be committed to 
implementing productivity-based capitalist principles. At the same time, the 
new government will be strong enough to make peace. Observers sometimes forget 
that Labor never signed a peace accord with any Arab government; only Menachem 
Begin's Likud did that. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this new government can offer major breakthroughs. But the Arab world will 
have to present its own peacemakers so that Shamir can talk with someone 
serious about living in harmony with a Jewish state.

One year ago, Secretary of State James A. Baker III called on the Israeli 
government to "lay aside the vision of Greater Israel, stop settlement activity 
and reach out to the Palestinians as neighbors who deserve political rights." 
The Bush Administration pressed the Shamir government to put forward a peace 
intiative and embraced the plan that emerged. Baker sought to lead Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir into a process that would develop a life of its own and 
ultimately result in Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, a lifelong advocate of Greater Israel, has proved too agile. His new 
government, no longer saddled with a Labor partnership, has directly challenged 
the United States with a pledge to "strengthen, expand and develop" settlements 
in the West Bank and Gaza. It is against this policy that the United States 
must define its relationship to the new reality in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of settlements is not merely one of many issues. It is the issue. It 
goes to the absolute core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Who will 
ultimately possess the land? The new Israeli government, which rejects the 
land-for-peace formula of United Nations Resolution 242, is squarely set on de 
facto annexation of the West Bank territory that Israel has occupied since the 
1967 war. This is a formula for a wider conflict with disastrous potential. 
What can the United States do? 
</P>
<P>
Words will not be enough. The United States has long stated its opposition to 
settlements. The Carter Administration branded them illegal under international 
law. The Reagan Administration termed them an "obstacle to peace." And the Bush 
Administration has consistently called on Israel to halt settlement activity. 
None of this has ever made much impression. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, when Israel was seeking $400 million in housing loan 
guarantees, Baker announced that Administration support would require a 
settlement freeze. This linkage was a major departure. But the Administration 
quickly retreated when it became obvious that Congress would balk. 
</P>
<P>
The President is well aware of the centrality of the settlement issue; for him, 
the question is one of political costs and benefits. The White House cannot win 
in Congress on any linkage of settlement to aid unless the President is willing 
to wage a major campaign. If this means fighting a unified American Jewish 
community, the President will not do it. There was not a major Jewish 
organization in the country that supported Baker's effort to link settlements 
to aid. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing this issue on Capitol Hill, it is clear that privately there is 
widespread sympathy for a tougher position but absolutely no willingness to 
take on the political firestorm that such a battle would entail. The truth is, 
it couldn't be won. There are no forces in American politics that could prevail 
against the united opposition of American Jewish organizations on the issue of 
aid. The irony is that most American Jews do not favor the settlements; rather, 
they fear that linking settlements to aid might snowball into a broad erosion 
of America's basic commitment to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
To move forward, what is needed is a way of taking a forceful stand on 
settlements that is not -- and will not be seen as -- anti-Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The President should seek from Congress the authority to establish an Israeli 
trust fund -- an account held in trust for the people of Israel -- and to put 
into it the appropriated monies that are equivalent to what Israel spends on 
the expansion of settlements. This would include both direct expenditures and 
hidden subsidies. The effort would not be to cut aid to Israel, but rather to 
set some aid aside until such time as the country adopts a permanent freeze on 
settlement expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The President might also be authorized to make disbursements from the trust 
fund to support the scores of dedicated Israeli organizations outside the 
government that promote human rights, democratic values and Arab-Israeli 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee, of course, that even this measure would produce the 
desired impact, but it would be a major step forward in establishing American 
credibility in the eyes of both Israelis and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
As it cannot happen without at least some support from the American Jewish 
community, the emerging question with respect to future American policy is: To 
what extent will American Jews distinguish support for Israel from support for 
the policies of the Shamir government?

EDUCATION SECRETARY CAVAZOS' CRITICISM OF LATINO PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos' is making statements that 
Latino parents deserve much of the blame for their children's high dropout rate 
and that they have lost their value for education ("Cavazos Reaffirms Stand in 
Criticism of Latino Parents," Part B, June 5; "Parents' Role Stressed at Latino 
Education Hearing," Part B, June 6). 
</P>
<P>
How do scholars like Cavazos come to think that Latino culture and its people 
don't value education? Does the scientific data support them? Are there studies 
that would challenge this way of thinking? 
</P>
<P>
The most recent empirical research on the topic of educational and occupational 
goals reveals that when students of the same social class are compared, Latinos 
have higher educational and occupational aspirations than whites. 
</P>
<P>
These and other data seem to suggest that Latino parents send, and their 
children come, to school with dreams that they will one day finish college and 
enter a high-status occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Why haven't these dreams been translated into higher educational and 
occupational attainment? Are we starting from the correct assumption if we 
state that all students attend schools of equal quality? If schools are not 
equal, then should we focus on certain school characteristics and show how they 
affect the achievement of Latino students? 
</P>
<P>
A focus on schools might allow the researcher to analyze the relative impact of 
segregated, overcrowded, and under-financed schools; school staffing, 
curriculum, and tracking patterns; and teacher expectations and interaction 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' editorial ("Are Latino Parents to Blame?" April 12) stated that, 
"Cavazos' challenge is not just prodding resistant Latino parents, but 
reluctant public officials (like his boss, President Bush) to ante up more 
money for innovative efforts that help the learning process along." If Cavazos 
and others don't take up your challenge and equalize educational opportunities 
and structures, the conclusion is inevitable that they, not Latino parents and 
students, are the ones who do not value education.

ANOTHER MEGA-SPILL BUT STILL NO ACTION; 
</P>
<P>
LAST WEEK'S NORWEGIAN TANKER ACCIDENT RAISES FEARS OF WHAT'LL HAPPEN NEXT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no easy or cheap solutions to the frightening problem of tanker 
spills, only complex and relatively expensive ones. 
</P>
<P>
But almost all the complex and expensive ones are considerably better than the 
hasty solutions that will inevitably be proposed if the public becomes even 
more frightened about the specter of a supertanker spill spoiling an entire 
coastline or befouling a whole bay. Irresponsible scaremongering? Consider the 
mess, political as well as ecological, in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for serious anti-spill action. Last week more than 4 million gallons 
of oil gushed out of the stricken tanker Mega Borg and invaded the waters of 
the Gulf of Mexico. The accident revived memo- ries of the American Trader 
spill off Huntington Beach in February, not to mention the Exxon Valdez 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon is out of pocket about $2 billion (and counting) for that one. How much 
better it would have been for that company and the industry as a whole -- not 
to mention the Alaskan environment -- if new regulations and procedures had 
been in place to minimize spill damage and to maximize the effectiveness of 
cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts agree that all new tankers should be fitted with crack-resistant 
double hulls. It's still not required. Strong state and federal legislation to 
guarantee adequate accident-contingency plans and appropriate mop-up technology 
still has not been passed. 
</P>
<P>
In California, calls to the state Legislature for a new state oil-spill office 
and a special fund for spill-disaster operations have not been acted upon; the 
job is still consigned to an interagency committee that's in over its head. 
</P>
<P>
Oil is an important energy material, and the oil industry has every right to 
want to be able to conduct its business operations profitably and without undue 
burden. But every business operates within imposed restrictions, regulates 
itself to some extent and does business within the wider framework of the 
overall public interest. Another Exxon Valdez would almost certainly lead to 
panicky remedial legislation that the industry might find far more odious than 
anything currently being proposed. 
</P>

EDUCATION SECRETARY CAVAZOS' CRITICISM OF LATINO PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The criticism of Latino parents by Cavazos was inaccurate, simplistic, crude 
and irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
Students, teachers and parents are equally accountable for attaining 
educational goals. 
</P>
<P>
To single out the parental role as a primary cause of the 40% dropout rate 
among Latino students unfairly cast a perception of negligence upon the people 
most deserving of respect. 
</P>
<P>
The value of learning is a central theme to us. Assimilation requires a daily 
assessment of this value. The Hispanic-American family is not anti-education. 
We are striving to assert our presence within an educational system that is 
culturally biased toward Anglo-American values; individualism, rationalism, 
empiricism. 
</P>
<P>
Adopting English as a second language causes students to make decisions 
regarding attachment and loyalty. English speakers are the public role models 
in the classroom. Spanish-speaking parents are a private resource outside the 
cultural mainstream. Latino students are asked to bridge the language and 
cultural gaps between home and school. The high number of dropouts indicates 
the schools are losing this battle. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos is alerting Latinos to a future of limited opportunity due to low 
educational advancement. To avert this plight parents are calling for 
courageous leadership and not petty backbiting from the nation's top education 
official.

THE CALL OF DEMOCRACY STILL UNHEARD; 
</P>
<P>
WHY DO THE SOVIETS PERSIST IN SQUANDERING SCARCE RESOURCES ON THE SHAKY ANGOLAN 
REGIME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE KIRKPATRICK, Jeane Kirkpatrick is a columnist based in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JAMBA, Angola 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why, having liquidated its East European empire, does the Soviet Union continue 
to pour billions in scarce resources into unreformed, non-European Marxist 
governments that rely on old thinking and old tactics in their effort to 
maintain power? 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviet government is no longer committed to the idea of an international 
class war destined to end with the triumph of Marxism, why in the world should 
it invest such disproportionate amounts in such unpromising places as 
Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola and Cambodia -- places where 
repressive one-party governments manage hopelessly inefficient economies under 
continuing siege by insurgent armies? 
</P>
<P>
Why shouldn't the Soviets accept for these countries the same sort of 
settlement they accepted in Nicaragua and in Namibia: free elections under 
international supervision? 
</P>
<P>
It makes no sense for a Soviet government willing to submit its own majority to 
the test of election to squander resources on such artifacts as the one-party 
dictatorships of Afghanistan's Najibullah or Angola's Jose Eduardo dos Santos. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Angola. No government has any real interest in protecting the sinecure 
of Angola's ruling Marxist regime, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola (MPLA). It is, in any case, extremely unlikely that any amount of money 
or war materiel can finally maintain this government in power. 
</P>
<P>
Former "colonials" call the sorry state of affairs in Angola the result of 
"Africanization." The government blames civil war. Neither is correct. 
</P>
<P>
It is not fair to describe as "Africanization" the process of continuing 
deterioration and decay to which the cities and economy of Angola have 
succumbed in the 15 years since Portugal's abrupt departure. Angola was 
overcome less by "Africanization" than by the very European disease of Marxism, 
with its policies of nationalization, central planning and control, its 
reliance on coercion and its elimination of the market and associated 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
It is also not true, as MPLA apologists pretend, that civil war has caused the 
decay of Angola's economy and the disorganization of its society. The reverse 
is more the case. Luanda is not a city under military attack. It is a city 
ravaged by incompetence, corruption and waste. 
</P>
<P>
Even with 60,000 troops and additional thousands of Soviet, Czech, North Korean 
and East German advisers, and even with military assistance amounting to 
billions of dollars annually, the MPLA has been unable to defeat the challenge 
of Jonas Savimbi and his National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, 
known as UNITA. It is true that UNITA has enjoyed assistance from various 
non-Communist governments in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia -- 
including the United States and South Africa -- but that aid has never 
approached the billions provided by the Soviets and the "world socialist 
system" to the government. 
</P>
<P>
UNITA has survived because its forces are well-organized, highly motivated and 
well-led. The government is simply outmatched. 
</P>
<P>
Of Jonas Savimbi himself, an African head of state said to me, "He is a 
classical hero who lives with his army in the bush and shares its hardships, 
who leads his men into battle and shares their risks. He is also the only 
African who has understood how to sustain a guerrilla war." 
</P>
<P>
Savimbi learned from the master of guerrilla war, Mao Tse-tung, how to strike 
where it hurts most and how to organize his own forces for a long-term 
struggle. He knows how to build a revolutionary army that provides food and 
clothing, schools and hospitals to its soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
He is also sophisticated enough to understand the irony in the fact that he 
practices socialism in Jamba -- UNITA's headquarters town -- while advocating a 
market economy for Angola. "We are an army at war," he shrugs, "not a normal 
society." 
</P>
<P>
His overriding goal now is to end the war and become that normal society. 
Savimbi wants for Angola what Namibia achieved: free elections under United 
Nations supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"Africa needs peace and democratic elections just as much as Europe does," 
Savimbi asserts. "The Angolan people have waited for 15 years for democratic 
elections. It is not reasonable that they should have to wait longer." 
</P>
<P>
What Angolans want is probably what Afghans, Cambodians, Mozambicans, Cubans 
and Vietnamese want as well. 
</P>
<P>
Why should the Soviet Union not cooperate in giving these unfortunate client 
states the same privileges it now accepts for Eastern Europe?

MICKELSON IS OPEN LOW AMATEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two-time NCAA champion Phil Mickelson of University of San Diego High finished 
as the low amateur at the U.S. Open at Medinah, Ill. with an even-par 288. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Mickelson shot an even-par 72. 
</P>
<P>
The only other amateur to make the cut, Dave Duval, was two under at the turn 
but faded to a 43 on the back nine and finished at 293. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson, an Arizona State sophomore, said success wouldn't make him leave 
school and turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
"I will finish my two years and hope to get some exemptions to get this 
atmosphere once in a while," the left-hander said. "It's nice to play against 
the best players in the world." 
</P>
<P>
If Mickelson was a professional, he would have collected $10,022 for his 
showing.

Lean and Mean: The once-hulking Speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas Foley

JACK SMITH: CURSES! SOME THINGS LAST FOREVER AND EVER AND . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fallon Evans, a professor of English literature, writes that he has had a 
vision of the hereafter. It is not a vision of his death, which he expects to 
be very ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Fallon believes he is destined to have an ordinary life and death. He explains 
that he spent World War II as a soldier stationed in Kansas, and the most 
extraordinary thing that happened to him in that time was having three changes 
in uniform of the day before breakfast one morning. That's the sort of exercise 
the officers think up to keep the troops on their toes when there isn't any 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
Fallon's vision is of himself lying in his casket, after all the rituals have 
taken place. 
</P>
<P>
"The undertaker has approached to lower the lid and screw in the last screws 
and my wife has come to take her last look. 
</P>
<P>
"And just as the lid closes, she will see, way down in one corner of the 
casket, one of those white plastic, non-biodegradable kernels that mail order 
houses use to cushion the purchase within the cardboard box. You know, the 
little walnut shaped things that flow out of the box and under tables and 
chairs . . . that show up in the kitchen weeks after, that always appear after 
the trash truck has left . . . those dratty little things that you can never 
get rid of? 
</P>
<P>
"And my wife will sigh and think, 'They beat him in death just as they did in 
life.' " 
</P>
<P>
I have no such vision, since I don't intend to be buried. With my 
claustrophobia it would kill me. I'm going up in smoke. 
</P>
<P>
But I do expect, until my dying day, to be pestered, teased, pursued, 
beleaguered and frustrated by those little plastic pellets he describes. 
</P>
<P>
They are undoubtedly the most fiendish invention of the packaging industry, 
which is by all odds the most fiendish of all industries. 
</P>
<P>
I have seen a lot of them. My wife enjoys mail-order shopping, so our living 
room is never quite free of them. As Evans says, they flow out of the box and 
under tables and chairs, where they resist recapture, only to turn up months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
He calls them kernels, which indeed they are. Some may look like walnuts, but 
the ones I see are more often round or shaped like peanuts. They have almost no 
weight. They are used to fill in the empty spaces in packages. When the package 
is opened they "flow" out, as Evans says. They are light on the air and they 
have an affinity for clothing. They cling to one's pant legs, and if you brush 
them off they float away and land somewhere else, like elusive flies. 
</P>
<P>
You can not pick them up by the handful. They flow out of your hand and hide 
under the sofa. They seem to have minds of their own. There is nothing to do 
but curse them. 
</P>
<P>
As Evans notes, they are non-biodegradable, another bad mark against them. 
Unlike Evans, when he is laid in his casket, they will last forever. When I see 
one on the rug, defiant, mocking me, I am not heartened by the knowledge that 
it will outlast me. It will never disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
I don't even know what these little monsters are called, or who manufacturers 
them. I only know that they are a curse on mankind, and one of the many 
pernicious products of our high technology. 
</P>
<P>
I believe I have already written of the impossibility of opening packaged goods 
-- even a loaf of bread. Fingernails and teeth are helpless against the plastic 
seals. They say, "Tear here," but nothing less than a knife or a pair of pliers 
can undo their indestructible embrace. 
</P>
<P>
I am rather given to dry cereals, which my doctor says were meant for herd 
animals to eat. I am discouraged, though, by the impossibility of getting at 
the cereal through that plastic inner sack without risking the loss of a finger 
by using a butcher knife. Even my wife, who is much better at these things than 
I am, gives up. Sheer strength will not pull those sealed flaps apart. The 
people who think these things up should be boiled in non-biodegradable oil. 
</P>
<P>
I occasionally receive review books from publishers. I despair every time I 
pick up one of those brown cardboard "jiffy" packages with the tongue you are 
suppose to pull to peel the package like a banana. Either I cannot find the end 
of the tongue or when I peel it, it doesn't open the package. Usually I end up 
using a large pair of shears or a large knife. 
</P>
<P>
As for medicines, the ingenious locking devices they think up to make the 
bottles inaccessible to children are nothing less than satanic. Even a plastic 
bottle of aspirin is harder to crack than a safe. And the irony of this 
elaborate precaution is that children don't seem to have any trouble opening 
them.

As for those little plastic peanuts, Evans is right: the only way to get rid of 
them permanently is to lock them in a casket and bury them.

INTO THE NIGHT: 'TRACY' CALLS ON DISNEY WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: The premiere of "Dick Tracy" Thursday at Walt Disney World in 
Orlando, Fla. The screening was at Pleasure Island, the party afterward at the 
Disney-MGM Studios theme park. Why Orlando? California may be the Disney 
empire's home, but Orlando is the New Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Between 3,000 and 5,000 guests; no one had an exact body count. 
On hand were the film's producer-director-star, Warren Beatty; co-stars 
including Dustin Hoffman, Estelle Parsons, Michael J. Pollard, Seymour Cassel 
and Glenne Headly; Disney execs Jeffrey Katzenberg and Rich Frank, plus 
EuroDisney's Bob Fitzpatrick. Co-star Madonna was absent because of a 
"recurring viral infection," a Disney spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Al Pacino stole the movie. And with no Madonna on hand he could have 
stolen the premiere, too. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "Whether it's the first weekend, or the first week, or the first month, 
this is a movie that's going to find its audience." Box office optimism from 
Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Unquoted: The tenaciously youthful Beatty is more monosyllabic than John Wayne. 
"Uh, yeah" accompanied by a hand flutter is presumed to speak volumes. When 
women reporters thrust microphones his way, he looks soulfully into their eyes, 
gently touches their hands and says nothing as he walks by. 
</P>
<P>
Theme: Reportorial excess. Hundreds of press, radio and TV people swarmed the 
Disney-engineered media circus that went on for four days. In addition to 
"Tracy," Disney was showing off the opening of the Dolphin Hotel and two films 
premiering later this summer, "Betsy's Wedding" and "Arachnophobia." The media 
ran the gamut from Radio Free Europe to Progressive Architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: Disney handed out black "Dick Tracy" T-shirts and fedora-style 
straw hats with the suggestion they be worn to the premiere. About 1,000 guests 
did, usually in combination with fluorescent Bermuda shorts and sandals. Beatty 
and Hoffman wore suits with black T-shirts. Katzenberg appeared to be the only 
person within a 200-mile radius wearing a dark suit and a tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Chow: Food stations were set throughout the park with barbecued shrimp, 
seafood cassoulet, roast beef, lamb chops, fettuccine derby and, for the more 
daring diners, "snails California." 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: No Madonna. This seriously dimmed the premiere's star power. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Disney throws parties the way Tolstoy writes novels. From the bus 
caravans to the fireworks display, this was a fiesta on the grand scale. All 
the rides at the park were open, celebs arrived via parade, Hoffman and Beatty 
were immortalized in cement at the Grauman's Chinese reproduction, there were 
two performances of two "Tracy" themed musicals.

POP CAPSULES : THE CRAMPS RECAPTURE INITIAL FRESHNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After floundering through a stretch of erratic live shows, numerous personnel 
shifts, record company woes and the danger of being stuck in a stylistic rut, 
the Cramps hit the Palladium on Friday with a healthy display of full-blooded, 
sexy, silly rock 'n' roll mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Ramones, the Cramps never veer very far from their original game plan. 
</P>
<P>
But behind their strongest album in years, "Stay Sick!," the band has 
recaptured its initial freshness. From Friday's opening blast of the country 
blues staple "Muleskinner Blues," the quartet's obsessive, full-throttle power 
overwhelmed any concerns of stagnation. Add to that an innate sense of 
absurdity -- where else would you find a singer in his early 40s named Lux 
Interior, clad in black vinyl bondage panties with matching stiletto-heel 
pumps, wiggling his lubricious way across the stage while hoarsely croaking 
something called "Daisys Up Your Butterfly"? 
</P>
<P>
With guitarist Poison Ivy distilling a pristine concoction of punky, 
psycho-billy guitar lines as stately as the rhinestone tiara on her head, the 
Cramps remain crown fools of sex-camp grunge-rock, proof that arrested 
development can be its own best virtue.CRAIG LEE

12TH PLAYBOY FESTIVAL TUNES UP FOR A BALANCED OPENING; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: A RANGE OF STYLES AND A MEASURED SERVING OF THE POPULAR AND ARTISTIC 
SHAPE THE START OF A SHOW WITH A CHECKERED HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It began at 2:25 p.m. Saturday, five minutes ahead of schedule, at the 
Hollywood Bowl. In spirit, though, the 12th annual Playboy Jazz Festival 
started in Flagstaff, with the Northern Arizona University Jazz Ensemble, and 
ended in Havana, with Poncho Sanchez and Tito Puente pumping out old-timey 
mambo-style dance music. 
</P>
<P>
In the sense that none of the nine acts offered anything offensive or out of 
place, and that moments of inspiration marked at least some parts of every set, 
this was among the most felicitously planned in the festival's slightly 
checkered history. 
</P>
<P>
The maintenance of that delicate balance between the popular and the artistic, 
the visceral and the cerebral, was kept with very few compromises. True, there 
was no single high point to carry into memory. The audience did not come fully 
alive until 6:15 p.m., during a Tommy Newsom suite played by the Doc Severinsen 
Orchestra, when Bill Henderson spontaneously joined the action and sang the 
blues, flanked by Severinsen and Snooky Young in a "talking trumpets" routine. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Joe Williams, waving a handkerchief during a blues vocal, soon had 
thousands of handkerchiefs blowing in the breeze. The Williams set promised a 
surprise that failed to materialize. With Jay McShann billed as an added 
attraction, it was natural to expect an unprecedented blues duet, but McShann 
stayed at the piano and, even when Williams sang a song McShann wrote and 
popularized, "Confessin' the Blues," the Kansas City veteran never raised his 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
The most adventurous group presented was a quartet composed of pianist Herbie 
Hancock, drummer Jack De Johnette, bassist Dave Holland and guitarist Pat 
Metheny. With routines that veered wildly between total freedom and basic 
three-part chords, and with Holland and Metheny both alternating between 
acoustic and electric instruments, this was a provocative set, chaotic when it 
started but more accessible as it went through a series of unannounced 
originals. 
</P>
<P>
The opening performance by the Arizona band offered inspiring new evidence of 
the team spirit and occasional solo accomplishments of which these college 
groups are capable. Pianist Jim O'Meally brought warmth and conviction to 
"Spirit of Trane." For a finale, the whole band roared decisively through Mat 
Catingup's witty piece, "Blues and the Abscessed Tooth." 
</P>
<P>
The "Tonight Show" ensemble, surely the most seen but least heard band in 
America, earned a rare chance to stretch out, with first-class arrangements by 
Newsom (whose alto sax shared honors with Pete Christlieb's tenor) and Bill 
Holman's new view of "Honeysuckle Rose." 
</P>
<P>
The Tony Williams Quintet, an energetic hard bop group, was noteworthy for the 
promise shown by a fast-rising trumpeter, Wallace Roney, and by the potent, 
driving piano of Mulgrew Miller. Williams, though magnificent as an ensemble 
drummer, insisted on starting almost every number with a long solo; for 
diversion during these stretches you could always catch up on a few features in 
the handsome 104-page souvenir program. 
</P>
<P>
The Chick Corea Trio, running the gamut from his own originals to Coltrane and 
Bud Powell and Monk, represented contemporary acoustic music flawlessly, with 
John Patitucci in his ever-more incredibly nimble form, and drummer Dave Weckl 
superbly supportive. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Eliane Elias blended determination and delicacy in two of her own works 
from the "Cross Currents" album. Surprisingly, she seemed less at ease 
interpreting the works of Antonio Carlos Jobim from her native Brazil. "Waters 
of March" was just a hair too aggressive and "Desafinado" too fast, with Peter 
Erskine's drumming slightly overbearing. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow musicians, notably Wynton Marsalis, have expressed the belief that Miles 
Davis has betrayed the achievements of his definitive years. Possibly Marsalis 
is wise beyond his years and Miles is years beyond his wisdom. Saturday evening 
he offered several passages of genuine beauty, mostly muted, but much of what 
he accomplishes today is limited by the rhythmic and harmonic monotony of the 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has found a new way to avoid talking to his audiences: When someone in 
the band is soloing, he holds up a placard bearing the soloist's first name. 
Kenny Garrett's alto sax tended toward longer phrases than Davis, but he too 
was given to repetition and choppy, staccato sounds. 
</P>
<P>
There was a shock for the 17,951 attendees when emcee Bill Cosby announced: 
"Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Gosa." Since the popular disc jockey died last year, 
this was a chilling moment, assuaged a little when Cosby added the names of 
Sammy Davis Jr., Dexter Gordon and Sarah Vaughan to clarify his oddly worded 
point (but he neglected to include a death as tragic as any, that of 
32-year-old Emily Remler).

ROYAL WINNIPEG BALLET IN 'THE BIG TOP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quick, name a ballet that ends with a young girl waking from a glittering but 
also menacing dream to hug her favorite doll. 
</P>
<P>
If you answered "The Nutcracker," you're right. 
</P>
<P>
If you answered "The Big Top," you're also right. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Lemay's hourlong circus remake of "The Nutcracker" for Royal Winnipeg 
Ballet turns up on Bravo tonight at 6 and midnight, with music by Victor Davies 
replacing Tchaikovsky's score and designs by Mary Robinson Kerr creating a 
spectacular dream world. 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1986 and seen here in a studio performance taped two years later, 
"The Big Top" first shows us little Beth (Leslie Fields) in a sepia-tinted town 
filled with quirky characters: "Twin Peaks" on pointe. Soon, however, a magical 
transformation delivers her to a blazingly colorful circus tent where the 
performers, somehow, keep resembling people she knows. 
</P>
<P>
Backstage, she's threatened by both a lion and a lion-tamer, then defended by a 
clown who looks exactly like her doll -- but you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the idea is sometimes all you get. Lemay's classical 
choreography invariably looks flat and spatially constricted, provoking 
unfavorable comparisons to better-known circus ballets. His teetering acrobats 
pale next to those in Massine's "Parade," for example, and the solo for Sugar 
Plum surrogate Evelyn Hart proves utterly unworthy of her. 
</P>
<P>
The demi-caractere divertissements, however, are often charming -- especially 
the snake trio the poodles and big cats. Besides Hart and Fields, the principal 
dancers include Svea Eklof, David Peregrine, Andre Lewis and Stephen Hyde. 
Norman Campbell directs expertly, combining stage and video effects. LEWIS

THE MET 'RING': A MIGHTY KITSCHY MINISERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't swallow all that hype. Television has suddenly invented neither the wheel 
nor the "Ring." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Opera broadcast of Richard Wagner's mighty, massive, 
sprawling, swollen, poignant, exasperating, uplifting tetralogy, "Der Ring des 
Nibelungen," which begins tonight on local PBS stations, is a milestone neither 
for mankind nor for TV. 
</P>
<P>
We have seen it all before. And we have seen it in a more compelling version. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, PBS traveled to Bayreuth to document Patrice Chereau's 
provocative, even revolutionary staging of the daunting cycle. This was a 
modern production that actually took the drama seriously. Chereau cared and 
dared to explore the sociopolitical implications of the epic as well as the 
obvious mythological convolutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Bayreuth "Ring" was filmed under studio conditions, not at actual stage 
performances. It was shown in this country with weeks separating each 
installment. Still, a hundred years after the premiere, it did offer home 
viewers a vital demonstration of Wagner's unique prowess as composer and 
dramatist. 
</P>
<P>
The Met "Ring," though taped, can claim the dubious advantage of documenting 
"live" performances. The Met "Ring" can claim the definite, domestically 
unprecedented, advantage of presentation on four consecutive nights. Still, it 
looks like a stylistic step into the dark operatic ages. 
</P>
<P>
The production, staged by Otto Schenk and designed by Gunther 
Schneider-Siemssen, is dull and lazy. It represents a fairy-tale trivialization 
of the momentous plot. At best, it is picturesque and quaint. At worst it is 
silly. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the ageless, timeless discourse on greed, the corruption of power and 
the redemption of love. Here is a naive charade in which overworked singers 
must carry spears, sport funny helmets and endure caricature breastplates while 
emitting lusty noises. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible -- unlikely, but possible -- that a Spielberg or a Disney could 
make the "Ring" magical for contemporary audiences on its own literal terms. 
The magic here, alas, harks back to hoary cliches perpetuated by provincial 
German opera houses in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Large, the television director, unwittingly accentuates the negative with 
close-ups that expose too much smoke, greasepaint and scenic fakery. Even 
worse, he often trains his cameras at the wrong face or place at a crucial 
moment. Adding verbal insult to visual injury, the clumsy English subtitles 
occasionally distort intended meanings ("Wo weilst du, Wotan. . . ?"). 
</P>
<P>
If this 17-hour, four-night mini-series has a hero, it must be the Met 
orchestra. The virtuoso ensemble dazzles consistently under James Levine's 
knowing, sometimes ponderous, often majestic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is patently uneven. Nevertheless, it adheres for the most part to the 
best current standards. 
</P>
<P>
James Morris is splendidly mellifluous if unincisive as Wotan. Hildegard 
Behrens offers much emotional, little vocal force as Brunnhilde. Though he 
fakes some top notes and runs out of steam near the end of the climactic love 
duet, Siegfried Jerusalem introduces an extraordinarily intelligent, imposing 
Siegfried, brilliantly offset by the Mime of Heinz Zednik (a Chereau alumnus). 
</P>
<P>
The ever-heroic Jessye Norman plays an ungainly Sieglinde to the bear-like 
Siegmund of Gary Lakes. Christa Ludwig, though past her prime, remains a 
sympathetic Fricka. The lower depths are well staffed by Ekkehard Wlaschiha's 
straightforward Alberich, Jan-Hendrik Rootering's sad and sonorous Fasolt, 
Matti Salminen's fierce Fafner and Kurt Moll's formidable Hunding. 
</P>
<P>
"Gotterdammering" was not available for advance screening. Performances seen at 
Lincoln Center last year suggest, however, that the denouement will contain no 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
This "Ring" is worth seeing, kitschy flaws and all. Any project of such 
magnitude is worth seeing. Still, it remains a "Ring" better heard than seen.

NANETTE BRODIE OFFERS PROGRAMMATIC WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH ZIMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dances in the service of drama, history and image dominated the concert offered 
by the Nanette Brodie Dance Theatre Saturday evening at Cal State Long Beach. 
Each of the six pieces had a program or some handle, making concept and 
intention easy to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
The eleven-member ensemble, mostly female, represented themselves as pigs, 
horses, chickens and hillbillies in "Auction," a romp to bluegrass music and 
the authentic voice of a rural auctioneer. For "Caravan," they dressed in 
flowing fabrics and posed in golden light in front of a cut-out wooden desert, 
bathing their bare arms in silver glitter. A faux-Chinese effort, "Madame Meets 
the Dragon" used masks and a huge dragon head trailing streamers, as well as 
women in silk brocade jackets manipulating increasingly large paper fans; Tony 
Hernandez offered a briefly powerful martial arts demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Any of these works might have been excised from an amateur musical comedy 
production. "A Tribute to Women Aviators" and "The Dream House Dash" combined 
voices and music to accompany groups of women either liberated or homebound. 
</P>
<P>
At its best, as in "La Reve Gotheque," Brodie's work dispensed with dance 
entirely, offering instead a carefully mounted playlet about a Victorian girl 
and the menacing sculpture she tames. Meaningful stares and stomping on stilts 
replace dancing in this work; the terrified girl rips out the statue's eyes and 
then, having second thoughts, replaces them and hugs him. 
</P>
<P>
Brodie's current works are pale and perhaps inadvertent reflections of many 
themes now in vogue among major contemporary choreographers. Her dancers rarely 
get their motors going fast enough to sustain interest. The music was recorded; 
the audience was very small.ELIZABETH ZIMMER

SOVIET RADICALS THREATEN WALKOUT AT PARTY CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radicals belonging to the Soviet Communist Party's Democratic Platform warned 
Sunday that they will walk out of a crucial party congress if it does not adopt 
fundamental reforms, including the abandonment of communism as a party goal. 
</P>
<P>
A national conference of the Democratic Platform, which wants a real end to the 
party's monopoly of political power and pluralism in party ideology, said that 
if its demands are not met, it will break with the Communist Party and form 
another, the first such split since the time of V. I. Lenin, the Bolshevik 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party will be denounced by the masses in the nearest future, and 
if the Democratic Platform remains in it, then it will certainly join the party 
in its collapse," Vladimir N. Lysenko, one of the faction's leaders, said in 
explaining the group's decision. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted at the weekend conference calls on the party to "renounce 
communism as the objective of the Soviet Communist Party and proclaim as its 
goal the building of a democratic society on the principles of freedom, justice 
and solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
It blames the country's multiple political and economic crises on the 
"inconsistency, indecisiveness and either incompetence or unwillingness of the 
leading (party) structures to carry out radical reforms." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Platform will also call for the party's withdrawal from the 
military, the police and other security forces, including the KGB, an end to 
the official status that party committees have at Soviet enterprises and 
organizations and a free press. 
</P>
<P>
It wants the party to become a parliamentary party, seeking power only in 
elections and exercising it only through legislative and executive bodies. 
Anticipating its own break, the Democratic Platform calls for the distribution 
of Communist Party property among the country's emerging political movements. 
</P>
<P>
But Lysenko, a delegate to the congress, predicted that the party, after a 
72-year monopoly of power, will still prove unable to undertake such a 
fundamental renewal. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the Democratic Platform will split from the Communist Party to 
form a new party," he said. "Still, it is very important for us to come to the 
congress because of those millions of Communists who still do not understand 
the essence of the Soviet Communist Party." 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of tactics, the 100 members of the Democratic Platform who won 
election as delegates will remain at the congress, starting July 2, until the 
end to use it as a forum to argue their positions and then try to take 
delegations from several of the Soviet Union's constituent republics -- 
including Estonia, Georgia and Moldavia -- with them as they leave. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to quit the party, proclaim it immoral and set up another 
organization, an alternative," Igor Chubais, another leader, said as the 
majority of delegates to the conference voted to quit if the Democratic 
Platform's proposals are not adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The group believes it might draw as many as 600,000 members -- a fraction of 
the 18 million members of the Communist Party but enough, organizers say, to 
compete in most urban elections. Under a constitutional amendment sponsored by 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, multi-party politics has been allowed in the 
Soviet Union since March. 
</P>
<P>
According to its own polls, the "political theses" put forward by the 
Democratic Platform are more widely supported than the party's official draft 
platform, and the faction's leaders believe that they have the sympathy, if not 
the active support, of 40% of party members and a majority outside the party. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the Democratic Platform's best known supporters -- Boris N. 
Yeltsin, the populist president of the Russian Republic, and Mayors Gavriil 
Popov of Moscow and Anatoly Sobchak of Leningrad -- will quit the Communist 
Party and join the new group remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis of poll results by political scientists at the Moscow Higher Party 
School, the effective headquarters of the Democratic Platform, said that its 
support is far from solid, even among sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
"A significant number of party members, regarding the Democratic Platform with 
approval, do not share many of its ideas," the analysis warned, "but only 
support the fact that an alternative movement has sprung up within the Soviet 
Communist Party." 
</P>
<P>
The character and shape of the new party is also unresolved, and organizers 
said they will probably not hold a founding congress before October. 
</P>
<P>
Although many supporters of the Democratic Platform would like it to become a 
social democratic party in the West European tradition, Vyachelsav 
Shostakovsky, the group's chairman and rector of the Moscow Higher Party 
School, which trains Communist Party officials, said he thinks that another 
philosophy and form will have to be developed. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have the roots or the traditions here in Russia for a social 
democratic party," Shostakovsky said. "It is difficult to predict, with so many 
uncertainties, how things will turn out." 
</P>
<P>
Formation of the Democratic Platform early this year brought demands from 
conservatives within the Communist Party leadership for the expulsion of its 
members, and the party's ruling Politburo set in motion a purge two months ago 
to "cleanse" the party ranks before the congress. 
</P>
<P>
After a few well-publicized dismissals and forced resignations, however, little 
seems to have come of the effort, though the Democratic Platform managed to 
capture only 2% of the 4,700 seats in the election of delegates to the party 
congress. 
</P>
<P>
The mainstream Moscow party organization, whose million members make it the 
largest party group in the country, meanwhile published a pre-congress platform 
of its own on Sunday, sharply criticizing the national leadership for drifting 
into "an ideological and organizational crisis."

FUND-RAISING IS IMPORTANT PART OF MANDELA VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If Nelson Mandela's tour of the United States goes as organizers hope, not only 
will the black South African leader deliver his anti-apartheid message to huge 
audiences nationwide, he also will raise several million dollars to pay for the 
trip and help fund political and social work back home. 
</P>
<P>
Money is very much a part of Mandela's 12-day, eight-city U.S. tour, which gets 
under way Wednesday when he arrives in New York and ends in California on July 
1. 
</P>
<P>
The coast-to-coast trip will incur some mighty costs. But organizers hope 
Mandela will inspire admirers -- from regular folks to Hollywood celebrities to 
corporate giants -- to dish out some mighty donations for the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Those who would market the Mandela name on souvenirs and trinkets have not been 
forgotten. Hundred-dollar silk jackets and commemorative coins are on the list 
of memorabilia under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say the money raised will pay for the trip, which carries a price 
tag estimated at $300,000 to $400,000. The remainder will go to the African 
National Congress, Mandela's organization that leads the fight against 
apartheid, South Africa's system of racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
The importance "is not only that people be able to see and honor Mandela and 
hear his message, but also have an opportunity to concretely donate to help the 
struggle in South Africa," said Mae Ngai, deputy operations director for the 
New York Anti-Apartheid Welcome Committee, which is overseeing preparations 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"So even if that means just $5, we think most people will welcome that 
opportunity to give to the ANC." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, New York and Detroit, $1-million fund-raising goals have been 
set -- the money to be collected through elegant receptions and dinners, 
rallies in sports stadiums and other events. 
</P>
<P>
Whether such fund-raising goals are realistic remains to be seen. Some 
donations are already in hand, but an accurate tally is difficult because the 
fund-raising efforts are decentralized and sponsored by individual groups in 
each city on Mandela's itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the office of Detroit Mayor Coleman Young says $300,000 has been raised 
there through donations from big business and others. In Los Angeles, movie 
studios and production companies have pledged tens of thousands of dollars; in 
New York, singer Billy Joel has booked Yankee Stadium and is lending it to 
Mandela for a rally. 
</P>
<P>
And one of the country's largest unions -- the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees -- is asking affiliates to pass the hat. 
</P>
<P>
But with preparations for Mandela's tour mired in what seems to be a constant 
state of disarray, lofty fund-raising goals may be in jeopardy. Experts in 
fund-raising caution that there has not been adequate time to gear up major 
money collection projects. 
</P>
<P>
Even if money comes pouring in, questions remain as to how much will be left 
after the bills are paid. While some cities are donating services such as 
police protection, organizers will still have to fork over big bucks for some 
items, such as the Coliseum in Los Angeles -- a key venue for Mandela to reach 
a large audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Events like this always cost more than you think," said a veteran fund-raiser 
in Los Angeles. "The big problem here is that they had to put it together in 
such a short time. There hasn't been enough time to organize, find underwriters 
and hit everybody up." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, a financially strapped organization that is emerging from decades of 
banishment, says it needs money to support and repatriate tens of thousands of 
refugees, set up district and branch offices in 14 regions of South Africa, 
launch literacy campaigns, and give job-training classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our needs are enormous," Lindiwe Mabuza, the ANC's chief representative in the 
United States, said in an impassioned plea for contributions during a news 
conference last week in Washington. "We have a grave need for financial and 
material assistance," she said. "And there is no other source of revenue." 
</P>
<P>
Mabuza said the ANC -- outlawed until shortly before Mandela's February release 
after 27 years in prison -- needs everything it takes to convert from an 
underground network to an openly active party: trucks, telephones, bicycles and 
other "instruments of democracy," such as fax machines, television and radio 
stations and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Money raised during the tour will be channeled into one of two funds: the 
tax-exempt Mandela Freedom Fund, established for educational, business and 
communications projects, and the nonprofit Democracy for South Africa, which is 
dedicated to political work. 
</P>
<P>
After New York, Mandela is scheduled to visit Boston and Washington (where he 
will meet with President Bush), Atlanta, Miami and Detroit before he arrives in 
Los Angeles on June 29. From Los Angeles, he travels to Oakland the next day 
and then departs for Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and much of his entourage will travel from city to city on a private 
jet furnished by a company that organizers refuse to identify. The U.S. State 
Department is providing security, and many companies involved in preparations, 
such as public relations firms, are cutting their rates for the tour in 
sympathy to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Others are working free of charge, such as Roger Wilkins, the tour's national 
coordinator. Wilkins is a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a 
Washington-based think tank. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, where Mandela is scheduled to preside over a rally and concert 
at the 90,000-seat Coliseum on June 29, sources involved in preparations expect 
the sales of tickets -- at $10 apiece -- to cover all or most of the local 
costs, assuming most tickets are sold. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are dealing with something like this, you have to make sure there are 
no hidden costs (or) you can wind up sinking the same ship you came to sail," 
said Danny Bakewell, head of the Brotherhood Crusade. The Crusade, along with 
several other organizations, donated $80,000 to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Only 12,000 tickets were sold as of Friday, according to Brenda Shockley, 
project coordinator for the Los Angeles Mandela Reception Committee. But 
Shockley noted that publicity for the event is just beginning. Groups are being 
encouraged to buy blocks of tickets that can be given away to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
If the Coliseum event does cover local costs, a $1,000-a-head reception at the 
old armory building in Exposition Park, scheduled for the same night, would 
generate pure profit, organizers said. Organizers hope to get 500 to 800 paying 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles is absorbing the cost of police services, traffic 
control and other logistics, a spokeswoman for Mayor Tom Bradley's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Bills to be paid include use of the Coliseum, which will staff the event with 
1,625 ushers, ticket-takers, concessionaires and security guards. Organizers 
have budgeted an estimated $200,000 for that, though Coliseum sources put the 
expected cost closer to $165,000. Another expense is 35 rooms for Mandela's 
entourage at the Biltmore, at a discount rate of $106 a night. The hotel is 
waiving the usual $1,800 charge for the presidential suite for Mandela and his 
wife, Winnie, a Biltmore spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is seen as a major source of funds because it is home to a number 
of liberal politicians and wealthy entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic support is coming from "every phase of the entertainment industry 
because people understand what this man stands for," said Paula Weinstein, who 
produced the movie "Dry White Season" and is helping to seek donations from 
studios and production companies. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, a flap erupted over an offer by Coca-Cola to provide a plane for 
Mandela and finance other parts of the trip. ANC leaders rejected the offer 
because of Coca-Cola's holdings in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute underscored a strict condition that Mandela's followers have 
imposed: No corporate donations are to be accepted from firms with investments 
or franchises in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of companies who claim to have left South Africa, what they have done is 
what we describe as a sham disinvestment," said Tandi Gcabashe of the American 
Friends Service Committee in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say several corporations are coming on-board. Among them, Reebok is 
helping to organize the tour, and Xerox Corp. has loaned office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "low-keyed" marketing aimed at capitalizing on anticipated Mandela 
mania is being planned to raise additional money. 
</P>
<P>
Under consideration are items such as $100 silk jackets, all-cotton T-shirts 
(no polyester blends allowed), posters, commemorative silver coins, 
limited-edition bronze busts and coffee table books of photographs taken along 
the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It just dawned on a lot of people that, since this is America, there's going 
to be T-shirts, posters, buttons -- whether authorized or not -- because that's 
the American way," said Stephanie Vardavas, licensing director of ProServ, the 
firm chosen to license and merchandise Mandela tour paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
"And it was best to harness that energy and turn it to the benefit of Mandela's 
cause rather than let energy be dissipated without doing any long-term good." 
</P>
<P>
ProServ, based in Arlington, Va., manages the careers of 250 sports stars, 
including basketball star Michael Jordan and tennis ace John McEnroe, and was 
chosen because its founder and chairman, Donald L. Dell, formerly represented 
black tennis player Arthur Ashe. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last week, few licensing contracts had been issued, and 
manufacturers cautioned that time was running out. 
</P>
<P>
An exception was Costacos Bros. Inc. of Seattle, commissioned to produce 
Mandela posters. Bob Porter, director of production and licensing, said the 
firm will print 50,000 posters initially, probably priced from $5.50 to $7.50 
each. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Joel was booked into Yankee Stadium this week -- but instead 
turned the facility over to Mandela's people for the night of their rally, 
according to Kip Cohen of Bill Graham Presents, organizers of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Carl McCaskill, a press spokesman for the Mandela committee in New York, said 
the goal there is to net $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Private fund-raising events in the city will cost guests up to $2,500 each, and 
will include a dinner hosted by actor Robert de Niro, director Spike Lee and 
comedian/actor Eddie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"Creative fund-raising" is being pursued by Little Steven Van Zandt, a rock 
singer who heads Artists United Against Apartheid. He has asked club owners and 
theaters around town either to donate their take for an evening or have their 
artists perform as a special tribute to Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, most tickets for a rally at the 49,000-seat Tiger Stadium on June 
28 will be sold for $10 or $20 apiece, but a batch of 5,000 will sell for 
prices ranging from $100 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, couples will pay $5,000 to attend a fund-raising reception at the 
Copley Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, where Mandela will address the annual convention of the AFSCME, 
members are being asked to contribute to show their "continued support" for the 
ANC and the fight against racism, said Bob Harman, the union's public affairs 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson reported from Los Angeles and Chen from Washington. Also contributing 
were Times researchers Lisa Phillips in New York, Leslie Eringaard in Detroit, 
Edith Stanley in Atlanta and Anna M. Virtue in Miami.

U.S. MILITARY LEAVES TOXIC TRAIL OVERSEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

ROHL, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States' far-flung network of overseas military bases, operating in 
secret and far outside the reach of American environmental regulation, has left 
a quagmire of chemical contamination all around the globe that will cost 
billions of dollars to correct and will damage American foreign policy 
interests for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the problem of toxic waste dumps created at home by industrial 
polluters has received high-level government attention, the very existence of a 
huge problem overseas is almost unknown outside the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the brook that runs through this small village just beyond the 
runways of Bitburg Air Base has been a dumping ground for unwanted jet fuel, 
chemical solvents and firefighting chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. military installations have polluted the drinking water of the 
Pacific island of Guam, poured tons of toxic chemicals into Subic Bay in the 
Philippines, leaked carcinogens into the water source of a German spa, spewed 
tons of sulfurous coal smoke into the skies of Central Europe and pumped 
millions of gallons of raw sewage into the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
Even as they defended the freedom and security interests of the United States 
and its allies, America's armed forces have bequeathed to their hosts another 
legacy as well, one of enduring environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Defense is not blameless," conceded David J. Berteau, the 
senior civilian Pentagon official in charge of environmental programs. "There 
(are) places where we have not lived up to our responsibilities. We've done 
some dumb things in the disposal of hazardous materials." 
</P>
<P>
Today, with the Pentagon preparing to close scores of costly foreign bases 
because of a deepening budget crunch and easing world tensions, the bill for 
decades of careless and arrogant environmental behavior is coming due. 
</P>
<P>
And the tab will be paid not only in billions of dollars in cleanup costs but 
also in strained relations with many of America's most valued allies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Army and Air Force officials in West Germany have warned that U.S. 
military officers or civilian employees face "the specter of criminal charges, 
especially concerning ground-water pollution." Such charges have already been 
brought in West Germany and Italy, where prosecutors have charged civilian 
employees of the U.S. military with illegal disposal of hazardous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
As the world's most extensive industrial enterprise, the military generates 
huge quantities of hazardous wastes -- used oils and solvents, paint sludges, 
plating residues, heavy metals, asbestos, cyanide, PCBs, battery acid, 
pesticides, herbicides and virtually every other toxic substance known to man. 
American military power plants in Europe also have caused significant air 
pollution and acid rain by burning high-sulfur content coal imported from the 
United States, a result of congressional action in the 1970s to help the 
faltering American soft-coal industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lethal Waste Piles Up 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also creates such special classes of lethal byproducts as 
high-level radioactive wastes from atomic weapons plants, high explosive 
powder, outdated chemical weapons, rocket fuels and ordnance practice ranges 
full of unexploded bullets, bombs and artillery shells. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 2 million men and women in uniform and 1 million civilian 
Pentagon employees stationed in the U.S. and around the globe daily produce 
tons of ordinary garbage, medical wastes, photographic chemicals and as much 
sewage as a large city. 
</P>
<P>
By the Pentagon's own admission, much of this waste has been treated cavalierly 
both in the United States and abroad. A seven-year survey of 1,579 domestic 
bases found 14,401 sites of known and suspected contamination, including 87 
that qualify for inclusion on the Superfund list of the most polluted places in 
America. Cleaning up the messes at U.S. bases will cost at least $20 billion, 
and perhaps as much as $200 billion, according to Defense Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has not even begun to assess the scope of the problem at foreign 
facilities, fearing the staggering cost of cleanup and the wrath of allies. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no systematic effort under way to determine how badly polluted 
America's overseas bases are, the Army -- without even looking formally -- has 
identified 300 contaminated sites in West Germany alone. Of the total, 30 are 
on bases slated for closure and 25 are currently deemed serious enough to 
require expensive long-term remedies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Polluted Sites Known 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has acknowledged that it has polluted soil, streams or ground 
water at every one of its airfields in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy says it does not know the extent of contamination at its many overseas 
bases because it has neither money nor a legal requirement to study the 
problem. The Navy's senior environmental officer conceded that the service is 
aware of a number of polluted sites worldwide but refused to identify them 
because, he said, it would create "problems with host nations." 
</P>
<P>
In disposing of its wastes, the Defense Department both in the United States 
and overseas has followed what it calls "the commonly accepted practices of the 
times." Those practices included, according to Pentagon documents, "discharge 
on the ground into unlined pits . . . or local creeks," "pouring and spraying 
on the ground," "drainage to industrial sewers," "burning during fire 
protection training" and "storage in leaking underground tanks." 
</P>
<P>
The result: thousands of sites where toxic pollution has poisoned drinking 
water, killed fish and birds, befouled the air and rendered vast tracts of land 
unusable for generations. 
</P>
<P>
Some severely contaminated Defense Department sites have become "national 
sacrifice zones," permanently fenced and guarded against any human use. 
</P>
<P>
Hermann Schafer, a brewery worker who lives in the town of Rohl, a scant three 
miles from Bitburg Air Base, complains that human waste, oil, solvents and 
firefighting foam from the base have over the years poured into the Rohlbach, 
the stream that winds through the village, killing fish, vegetation, even 
insects. 
</P>
<P>
"Pipelines from the base end in this formerly natural brook, making it more or 
less a sewer," he said recently. "Nothing can live in it." 
</P>
<P>
The base only last year completed a new sewage treatment plant after years of 
complaints from West German authorities about pollution of the Rohl creek and 
several other nearby streams. 
</P>
<P>
The base, home of 72 F-15 Eagle fighters, also imposes high-decibel pollution 
in the form of deafening day and night jet noise, Schafer complained. Base 
officers said the jets take off and land 150 times a day in good flying weather 
and practice low-level flying over a wide swath of central West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force, with no trace of irony, calls jet noise "The Sound of Freedom." 
Schafer and others call it "air terror" and consider it an affront to West 
German sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens are sick and tired of Americans eating up more and more land and 
putting a burden on them of 24-hour-a-day noise," said Schafer, 52. "We have a 
right to human health in our constitution, and it is constantly stepped on by 
the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
The full extent of the military's overseas pollution remains shrouded in 
secrecy, the result of a deliberate U.S. government attempt to conceal data on 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The only congressional audit on the subject, a 1986 study which uncovered 
significant toxic contamination at U.S. bases in West Germany, Italy and 
England, was quickly stamped secret by the Pentagon and the State Department 
because of the potential diplomatic fallout. Publicizing the information, 
officials argued, could affect sensitive negotiations on the return of leased 
facilities to host countries, which are expected to demand that the United 
States undertake costly cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also worry that evidence of severe pollution at overseas bases might 
intensify calls -- already being heard in West Germany, Greece, Spain and the 
Philippines -- for the Yankees to pack up their noisy, dirty weaponry and go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
A second congressional study, now being prepared, is also expected to be 
classified for national security reasons. Officials familiar with the report 
said, however, that there has been little improvement in the situation in the 
four years between the two studies. 
</P>
<P>
In response to requests by The Times under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act 
for data on contamination at specific foreign bases, the Air Force said it 
could not meet the law's legal deadline and would provide some information at 
an unspecified future date. The Navy did not respond at all. 
</P>
<P>
An internal Pentagon memorandum obtained by The Times called hazardous waste 
contamination in Europe "an emerging political issue" and "a serious budget 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
According to the memo, prepared after a visit in late 1988 to West Germany by a 
senior Pentagon environmental official, "the Air Force has been hesitant to 
identify and investigate sites because of the potential political 
ramifications. They have a technical-political dilemma. If they identify sites, 
do nothing and the Germans find out, they have problems. If they don't do 
anything and the Germans identify (that) the pollution exists, they have 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The memo noted that then-U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Richard R. Burt 
proposed to address the problem by "lobbying the press 'much like the military 
lobbies Congress' to give them good stories to print about military pollution 
abatement and maneuver damage minimization efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Some German officials, however, consider American pollution of their country to 
be more than a mere public relations nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"The extent of contamination on U.S. bases is shocking," said Gernot Rotter, a 
member of the environmentalist Green Party in the legislature of the German 
state of Rhineland-Pfalz, home of the largest contingent of American GIs 
outside the United States. "Up to now, the government in Bonn has done nothing. 
I'm not blaming the Americans as much as the German government, which has 
allowed them to do whatever they want. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's the problem. The military is entirely self-regulating. Militaries 
are always arrogant. They are separate. They speak a different language. They 
have a different culture. They make up their own rules," Rotter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regulation Is Lax 
</P>
<P>
In theory and in policy, the American armed services abroad follow U.S. or host 
nation environmental law, whichever is stricter. In practice, they follow 
neither because U.S. regulation does not reach overseas while military 
installations are generally exempted from host nation laws under basing 
agreements, said Rep. Richard Ray (D-Ga.), chairman of a House Armed Services 
Committee panel that monitors military environmental practices. 
</P>
<P>
"There has not been a thorough or independent review of the Department of 
Defense's compliance with this policy" requiring voluntary adherence to U.S. or 
foreign law, Ray said at a recent hearing on the subject. "And, in addition, 
consistent environmental guidance among the various services did not appear to 
exist within the same host nation." 
</P>
<P>
Berteau, the Pentagon environmental official, conceded that in the past 
overseas military commanders treated wastes negligently, but said the current 
generation of officers is "a lot more sensitive to these issues than previous 
commanders were." 
</P>
<P>
Yet today, seven years after the Pentagon created the Defense Environmental 
Restoration Program to investigate chemical contamination at U.S. facilities, 
the Defense Department has no program and no budget for cleaning up its 
polluted overseas bases, Berteau acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of past negligence at overseas installations, negotiations with 
foreign governments over environmental damages will be tense, expensive and 
perhaps ultimately damaging to U.S. interests abroad, senior military and 
civilian government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're getting into some very sensitive foreign policy questions," Berteau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. commanders responsible for environmental management in Europe have only 
recently begun to devote money to investigating and cleaning up toxic pollution 
on bases there. Maj. Gen. Bill Ray, chief of engineering at U.S. Army-Europe 
headquarters in Heidelberg, West Germany, said he spends about $25 million of 
his $1-billion annual budget on environmental compliance and cleanup. But he 
acknowledged that the sum only begins to address the very worst problems and 
that his environmental activities are "grossly undercapitalized." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force spends $9 million to $10 million a year on environmental 
protection projects in Europe, but such a sum could easily be consumed by the 
cost of cleaning one medium-sized contamination site, according to 
environmental officials at U.S. Air Force-Europe headquarters at Ramstein Air 
Base in West Germany. The service spends a total of $25 million on all 
environmental activities outside the United States, according to Air Force 
officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force's current worst known site in West Germany -- extensive jet fuel 
contamination of ground water at Rhine-Main Air Base near Frankfurt -- will 
cost an estimated $15 million and take at least five years to clean up, 
officials said. Bonn and Washington are negotiating the question of who pays 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. John R. Mullans of the Army Corps of Engineers, in charge of 
environmental activities at the huge Kaiserslautern complex of Army 
installations in West Germany, said there are dozens of known and suspected 
sites of chemical contamination at "K-town's" 16 separate facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the hot spots are motor pool areas where used oils and chemical 
cleaning solvents were simply dumped on unpaved ground for decades, 
contaminating soil and likely polluting ground water. Mullans stated flatly 
that the Army does not have the money to clean up the sites -- or even to pave 
most of the motor pools -- "given the current funding situation." 
</P>
<P>
In another example of how current budget problems contribute to environmental 
degradation abroad, Kaiserslautern was scheduled to get an approved storage 
facility to handle hazardous wastes until they can be safely disposed of at 
licensed German dumps or sent back to the United States for burial. But funding 
for the facility -- and several others like it in Europe and elsewhere -- has 
been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some stuff sitting around for two years," Mullans said. "I now have 
no clear way to get rid of contaminated soil. I've got mounds of it just 
sitting on slabs." U.S. law prohibits storage of toxic waste for more than 90 
days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third World Problems 
</P>
<P>
The military's record in Western Europe, given the relatively high 
environmental awareness among governments and publics there, raises troubling 
questions about its behavior in less developed regions. U.S. forces have 
operated on a large scale for years in such places as South Korea, the 
Philippines, Central America and Southeast Asia, where environmental regulation 
is embryonic at best. 
</P>
<P>
In the few instances when environmental issues have emerged in these parts of 
the world, the news has been bad. 
</P>
<P>
Public health officials in Guam discovered that the Air Force had dumped large 
quantities of the cleaning solvent trichloroethylene (TCE), a suspected human 
carcinogen, onto the ground and into storm drains, contaminating the water 
table that supplies three-quarters of the Pacific island's population with 
drinking water. Tests showed TCE levels at some points in the aquifer to be six 
times the permissible limit. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that the Air Force had 20 suspected contaminated sites on 
the small island, a U.S. territory, while the Navy had at least seven and 
possibly 34 sites. The Navy's illegal dumping and improper handling of toxic 
wastes contaminated soil at the Naval Complex on Guam and polluted the 
shoreline and ocean, the General Accounting Office found. 
</P>
<P>
The situation may be worse in the Philippines, where the United States 
maintains two huge military installations, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval 
Base. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force official in Washington, questioned about environmental compliance 
at Clark, said there is no legal mandate to assess ecological damage on the 
sprawling base and no such survey has been done. He added: "We comply with host 
country laws. In the Philippines, there are none, so we are not in violation of 
any." 
</P>
<P>
Said Berteau: "There is no reason to believe that the activities at Subic were 
any better than at U.S. facilities" in this country. Comparable Navy yards in 
the United States are among the worst sites on the Superfund list. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a horror story out there," Berteau said, "Subic may be it." 
</P>
<P>
With the threat of a Soviet-led invasion of Western Europe evaporating and the 
U.S. defense budget contracting, the United States is planning to close dozens 
of bases in Europe and return thousands of troops, tanks and aircraft to 
America. The United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies 
must now wrestle with the delicate questions of how much pollution the 
departing U.S. forces caused and who should pay to repair it. 
</P>
<P>
"When the threat was perceived to be high, we could do virtually anything," 
said David Lange, chief of intergovernment relations for the U.S. Army in 
Europe. Now, he said, European governments are beginning to demand compliance 
with their environmental laws and insist that the United States shoulder the 
cost of returning military facilities to safe and usable condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, there has been a double standard when it comes to overseas projects," 
said David Wirth, a former State Department attorney now on the staff of the 
New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always a severe foreign policy risk in that. We want to maintain good 
relations with countries where we had bases and are now turning them over. To 
hand over environmental problems we wouldn't tolerate ourselves is a ripe area 
for a foreign policy crisis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The German people are just now becoming aware of the extent of lasting damage 
caused by the hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops based in West Germany since 
the end of the World War II. 
</P>
<P>
There are currently 255,000 American troops stationed at about 1,000 
installations in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans, they see Germany as a U.S. military-industrial laboratory," 
said Olaf Achilles, founder of a small organization in Bonn that monitors the 
environmental behavior of the United States, West Germany and other NATO 
militaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Every German environmental law exempts the military, and the local authorities 
know very little about what goes on on U.S. bases. Our government is so stupid 
and blind to all this," Achilles said. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old urban planner noted the environmental record of the military in 
the United States as documented by the Defense Environmental Restoration 
Program. "Now they know what they've done wrong in the United States," Achilles 
said. "They've done much more wrong outside of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West Germans Upset 
</P>
<P>
Another West German citizen, Wilma Herzog of nearby Gerolstein, expressed 
disappointment that the United States, where she lived for 12 years, has 
treated the German people and the German countryside with such apparent 
disregard for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sadness and shock that America has such a dark side," said Herzog, 55, 
who is organizing a citizens group to address low-level flying and other 
military intrusions. 
</P>
<P>
"They are destroying the environment and torturing the people," Herzog said. "I 
thought the Americans were smarter than this. I thought the Americans were 
better than this."

LITHUANIANS COOL TO SUSPENSION OF SECESSION MOVE

<P>
The proposed suspension of Lithuania's declaration of independence from the 
Soviet Union is likely to meet strong opposition when it is put before the 
republic's Parliament, key deputies warned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Although recommended by the Baltic republic's Cabinet as the only way to break 
the political stalemate and lift the economic blockade that followed the 
declaration, the suspension was sharply criticized at a lengthy Sunday meeting 
of the Lithuanian Parliament's leadership in the capital of Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
"The declaration of independence is untouchable," Kazimieras Moteika, a vice 
chairman of the Supreme Council, the republic's Parliament, said after the 
three-hour meeting. "We are ready to compromise, but not on our independence. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody will support such an appeal. The (independence declaration) is the edge 
we cannot trespass, even temporarily." 
</P>
<P>
Other political leaders also criticized the proposal, put forward by Prime 
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, to declare a "temporary moratorium" on the March 
11 declaration of independence for the duration of negotiations between 
Lithuania and Moscow on the republic's secession from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the republic is very unfavorable toward such a decision," 
another deputy said. "The voters do not like such words as 'canceling,' 
'freezing' or 'suspending.' When I met with my voters, they were telling me, 
'We can last easily for another year.' " 
</P>
<P>
Approved at a Saturday meeting of the Lithuanian Cabinet, the proposed 
"moratorium" represents a retreat by the Baltic republic in order to satisfy 
conditions laid down by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the 
negotiations be conducted solely within the framework of the Soviet 
constitution and legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"This suspension is out of the question," Virgilius Cepaitis, general secretary 
of Sajudis, the pro-independence Lithuanian national movement, said. "How can 
we 'freeze' our independence? 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a decision with a noose around the neck, made under pressure of 
blackmail and violence in the conditions of the economic blockade. It is 
ridiculous to speak about the good will of the Kremlin." 
</P>
<P>
Vytautas Landsbergis, the Lithuanian president, predicted a heated debate when 
the proposal comes before the Supreme Council on Tuesday, but he indicated that 
he will support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very suspicious of Moscow," Landsbergis said. "This will be a 
difficult debate. It is more likely that the Parliament will reject it." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian president stopped short of endorsing the proposal himself, but 
he told Reuters news agency he believes that a compromise with the Soviet 
leadership is now possible. "I hope so," he said, adding that his meeting with 
Gorbachev last week had been friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the possible formulas for discussion," Landsbergis continued. 
"We will discuss this formula and others." 
</P>
<P>
His comments and those of other Lithuanian officials suggested that their 
strategy might be to undertake "talks about talks" so as to win further 
concessions without having to suspend the declaration formally and to blur 
virtually all distinctions between the various stages of negotiations so that 
discussions can move back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
As explained in a government statement, the Cabinet is proposing "a temporary 
moratorium . . . during negotiations with the Soviet Union" of the declaration 
of independence, not just the resolutions and laws adopted after it. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Lithuania are waiting for new initiatives and practical steps 
from the Parliament and the government in the consolidation of our 
independence," the statement continued. "In the opinion of the government, it 
is a favorable time for negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
But Algimantas Cekuolis, a member of the independent Lithuanian Communist 
Party's Central Committee, said he too doubted that the Parliament would 
approve the proposal, probably due to suspicion of Moscow or perhaps in hopes 
of a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with Moscow have always been bad," Cekuolis said. "They have 
broken every agreement that they ever had with us. In the Kremlin, they say 
they are different now. But, I ask you, would you buy a used car from this 
government?" 
</P>
<P>
Moteika, a lawyer, argued that the Lithuanian government's recommendation to 
the Parliament has little legal basis. 
</P>
<P>
"The government did not adopt any decision, nor is this a decree," he said. 
"There, in fact, was no voting on this . . . proposal." 
</P>
<P>
Predicting a heated debate, Moteika added, "There is nothing final in this." 
</P>
<P>
Cekuolis said that Gorbachev has apparently softened his position on Lithuania 
recently because of other problems, including the country's economic crisis and 
the election last month of the populist Boris N. Yeltsin as president of the 
country's Russian Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Western pressure is also having an impact, Cekuolis said. President Bush took 
up the Baltic crisis several times during Gorbachev's visit to Washington, and 
other Western leaders have focused on it as well. The U.S. Congress, meanwhile, 
has said that it will not approve the new Soviet-American trade agreement until 
the economic blockade of Lithuania is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
A compromise began to emerge last week when Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet, 
the country's legislature, that negotiations could begin if Lithuania simply 
suspended its independence declaration for the duration of talks. 
</P>
<P>
Then meeting with Landsbergis and other Baltic leaders, Gorbachev assured them 
of the Kremlin's willingness to negotiate terms for their secession but 
outlined his vision of a commonwealth of sovereign states developing from the 
present Soviet Union as an alternative to go-it-alone independence. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate the Soviet government's good will, Prime Minister Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov ordered partial restoration of the natural gas supplied to Lithuania so 
that a key fertilizer plant could resume production, as well as shipment of 
some other raw materials needed by Lithuanian factories. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining its recommendation, the government said in a formal statement that 
after the last round of meetings in Moscow, involving Gorbachev and Ryzhkov on 
the Soviet side and Landsbergis and Prunskiene on the Lithuanian side, "it 
became clear that the authorities of the Soviet Union are ready to go into 
compromise with the Lithuanian authorities and are actively preparing for 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet said its proposal was motivated by the need "to consolidate the 
Lithuanian state, to get international recognition and to normalize relations 
with the Soviet Union" and would not undercut "the unquestionable right" of 
Lithuanians to re-establish their independence.

About a thousand convicts barricaded themselves in a riot-torn Ukrainian prison 
and took up positions on the roof after police tried to evacuate the rioters. 
</P>
<P>
Two inmates have reportedly been killed in the four-day-old riot. The 
Dnepropetrovsk prison, one of the largest in Europe, holds both convicted 
criminals and suspects, including women and teen-agers. The riot reportedly 
started after some women prisoners screamed that they were being beaten.

Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist Abu Nidal battled with 
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in southern Lebanon, killing at 
least four people and wounding 15, police said. The outbreak was the bloodiest 
between the two factions since a mutiny within Abu Nidal's Revolutionary 
Council of Fatah three years ago. The new fighting erupted in the Rashidiyeh 
refugee camp, south of Beirut, and continued until fighters loyal to Yasser 
Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization 
intervened.

Yitzhak Shamir's new right-wing Cabinet gave former generals Ariel Sharon and 
Rafael Eitan their biggest say in military policy since both were reprimanded 
for actions during the 1982 Lebanon invasion. At its first meeting, the Cabinet 
named Sharon, a former defense minister, and Eitan, chief of staff during the 
Lebanon invasion, to the 11-man ministerial Defense Committee. Sharon, a leader 
of the conservative Likud Party, also was named chairman of a Cabinet committee 
overseeing the immigration of Soviet Jews.

MAN HELD IN DEATHS OF EX-GIRLFRIEND, MOTHER; 
</P>
<P>
KILLINGS: AMTRAK POLICE ARREST HIM AT UNION STATION. HE HAD CHECKED INTO MOTEL 
WHERE VICTIM'S CAR WAS FOUND.

<P>
A 23-year-old man described by authorities as a jealous former boyfriend was 
arrested Sunday in the bludgeoning deaths of a Walnut woman he once dated and 
her mother. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Russell Moon of Walnut was arrested by Amtrak police officers shortly 
after midnight at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, after they received a 
tip from Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives that he was preparing to leave 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Moon was held without bail in the deaths of his former girlfriend, Melitta 
Greig, 22, and her mother, Rose Greig, 53, whose bodies were found Saturday in 
the trunk of the family car. 
</P>
<P>
"When they broke up, Richard wouldn't let go," said Father Bill Leser, pastor 
of St. Martha's Church in La Puente, where Melitta Greig attended parochial 
school and her mother worked as the parish secretary and bookkeeper. "He was 
having a very hard time saying goodby." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Pooley, manager at the Fullerton AMC theater where Melitta Greig worked 
for the last seven months, described her as "bright, outgoing, a pleasure to be 
around, a take-charge kind of girl." 
</P>
<P>
Moon was not initially a suspect in the killings, although detectives planned 
to question him, Sheriff's Sgt. Rey Verdugo said at a Sunday morning press 
conference. He became a suspect Saturday evening, however, when sheriff's 
deputies spotted Melitta Greig's missing Volkswagen Cabriolet convertible in a 
motel parking lot in Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The car's distinctive license plates -- ATTILEM, or Melitta backward -- had 
been removed and stashed in the car, Verdugo said. Moon had registered at the 
motel that afternoon, but deputies did not find him there. 
</P>
<P>
Moon, it turned out, was on his way north, Verdugo said. He had called a friend 
for a ride to the Fullerton Amtrak station, where he boarded a train for Los 
Angeles and then bought a combination train and bus ticket that would take him 
as far as Fresno. He told the friend he was headed for Seattle, Verdugo said. 
</P>
<P>
Moon never boarded his 1:50 a.m. bus in Los Angeles. Watching television, the 
friend's mother learned that authorities were looking for him. Realizing that 
her daughter had just driven him to Union Station, she called the Sheriff's 
Department, which according to Amtrak police Officer Joe Gross, contacted 
station authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Gross said he and fellow Amtrak Officer Miguel Pintos arrested Moon without 
incident and held him for sheriff's detectives. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a relationship severed quite a while back," Verdugo said after 
detectives interviewed Moon Sunday afternoon. "But he seems to have held a 
fascination for her." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they believe the mother and daughter were killed in their 
garage between 1 and 3 p.m. Friday. Rose Greig was last seen about 12:15 p.m., 
when she received a phone call in the parish office and left work abruptly. 
Melitta Greig never showed up for her 4 p.m. shift as a supervisor at the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Greig, Rose's husband and Melitta's father, discovered the bodies in the 
trunk of his wife's car when he came home from work about 1 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A piece of wood and a hammer found in the garage are being examined as possible 
murder weapons, Verdugo said. 
</P>
<P>
According to friends and co-workers, Moon, a student at Mt. San Antonio 
College, met Melitta Greig a few years ago when both worked at an AMC theater 
in Puente Hills. They dated on and off until about six months ago, when Melitta 
broke off the relationship, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
Theater employees said Moon was raised in Modesto and came to Walnut after his 
parents' divorce. They said he would clown and roughhouse with other employees 
and patrons. Once, he lost his job for putting a dead mouse in the cash 
register as a practical joke, said Alice Rogers, a former supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Moon called Rogers and asked if he could come back to work at the 
theater, she said. His job as a sixth-grade camp counselor was about to end, he 
told her. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to come by Sunday and we'd fill out the paper work," Rogers said. 
"Sometimes he would pull some stunt, but he was one of the best workers I have 
had." 
</P>
<P>
For a time, the Greigs served as a surrogate family for Moon. He lived at their 
hillside home for a few months while he was between apartments and he still 
stopped by Melitta's grandparents' home for lunch and to pick up mail, said 
Linda Montoya, the Greigs' next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Moon's arraignment on murder charges is scheduled for Tuesday.

BUDGET CUTS KNOCK AT CLASSROOM DOOR; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL BOARD IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN DECIDING TODAY 
WHERE TO SLASH ANOTHER $101 MILLION FROM NEXT FISCAL YEAR'S BUDGET.

Judith Haut worries about high school students driving along busy, curving 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard if the Los Angeles Board of Education drops bus 
service to help dig its way out of a huge budget hole. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Clark is appalled that her child's magnet elementary school in the 
Fairfax area might have to surrender the state lottery proceeds that provided 
art, music and other special projects this year. 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Luna, a counselor at Roosevelt High School in East Los Angeles, fears 
that cuts in the counseling staff will have a devastating effect on efforts to 
keep minority students from dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
Others shrink from the specters -- of dirtier buildings, bigger classes, fewer 
security aides on crowded playgrounds -- conjured up by a proposed "cut list" 
that would claim 1,300 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As board members struggle to slash another $101 million from the coming fiscal 
year's budget, they are finding it increasingly tough to keep the cuts away 
from the classroom. Unlike the first $119 million board members eliminated 
earlier this year -- largely by juggling funds and cutting 634 district 
administrative jobs -- the choices awaiting them today are "hovering right 
there at the school . . . and that is really, really painful," board member 
Warren Furutani said. 
</P>
<P>
The state's largest school district is not alone in having to cope with scarce 
dollars. Districts up and down California, from Beverly Hills to Richmond in 
the Bay Area to Redding and Yuba City in the north, are looking for ways to cut 
programs and jobs in the face of rising costs and tightened funding from the 
state, which provides most of local schools' money. Grant Union High School 
District near Sacramento has voted to lay off teachers, as has Acalanes, a high 
school district in an affluent Bay Area suburb. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the job of delivering a balanced, tentative spending plan to 
the county by June 30 has been further complicated by the refusal of board 
members Rita Walters and Leticia Quezada to vote for any of the proposed cuts. 
That has put extra pressure on their five colleagues as the 610,000-student Los 
Angeles Unified School District finds itself in its biggest financial jam since 
voters slashed property taxes with Proposition 13 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Quezada and Ms. Walters have taken a powder on (voting on) the cuts, and 
that just makes it all the more difficult for the rest of us," said Roberta 
Weintraub, echoing sentiments expressed by most other board members. 
</P>
<P>
And things could get worse. If the Legislature does not sweeten the governor's 
budget proposals in several key areas for the state's schools, the district 
could find itself short another $80 million by the time the board must adopt a 
final 1990-91 budget of just over $4 billion in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a devastating situation, and board members have a very, very difficult 
job," said Cecelia Mansfield, president of the 31st District PTA, which 
represents district schools in the San Fernando Valley. She, like some others, 
is advocating a state tax increase for schools. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Booker, the district's chief business and financial officer, said the 
board's message to administrators was clear: "The bottom line was keep cuts 
away from schools and classrooms . . . but the amount is so substantial that it 
is not going to be possible to not affect schools." 
</P>
<P>
The board recently hired the accounting firm of Coopers and Lybrand to help it 
overhaul the district and recommend ways to make further cuts. The firm's 
report is to be made public today, when board members are expected to vote on 
at least some reductions. They also will get another $32 million or so in 
alternatives to consider but will vote on those later. 
</P>
<P>
Board members demanded some alternatives to the list drawn up by Supt. Leonard 
Britton and district financial officers after meetings with the board, PTA, 
union leaders and school and community representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe those are the only choices," said board member Mark Slavkin, 
adding that he is not convinced the $33 million recently sliced in a 20% 
reduction of district administration went far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"There is lots here I won't vote for; that's why I want some alternatives," 
board President Jackie Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony at several public hearings held by the board on the suggested cuts 
and calls to district offices provide glimpses of what various cuts will mean. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, many parents and teachers are objecting to a proposal to take 
away the $8 million in lottery funds now distributed among the schools to spend 
as they see fit. The district already spends most of its $112 million annual 
share of lottery profits on salaries and other fixed costs, despite the 
uncertainty over just how much money will be coming from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most emotional testimony has come from employees in areas that 
stand to lose many jobs, many of which are positions held by women and minority 
group members. 
</P>
<P>
How did the district get into the position of having to make what will be 
record reductions? Several factors, including years of exploding enrollment and 
rising costs that constantly outstripped increases in state funding, 
contributed to this year's difficulties. The board also solved -- some say 
ducked -- many of its budget problems in other years by taking "one-time 
savings" and borrowing against reserves or other funds that it was not 
compelled to spend on intended purposes right away. 
</P>
<P>
"We've absolutely depleted reserves and borrowed the heck out of building and 
deferred maintenance and other funds," said board veteran Weintraub. "Booker 
(the budget chief) has been warning us for many years that we were in deficit 
by using one-time money, that those problems would just be waiting for us in 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We always got rescued at the last minute (with added state funds), and that 
makes it difficult to believe we won't be rescued again, but (because of the 
state's own projected deficit this year) we won't be." 
</P>
<P>
Walters and Quezada have angered other board members with their flat refusal to 
vote for any of the cuts. Quezada said she is protesting the lack of 
alternatives and complained that administrators have ignored board members' 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I have as a board member, my only prerogative, is my vote," 
Quezada said. "I guard that, I treasure that, and I use it conscientiously. I 
don't believe in these cuts. I cannot in good conscience vote for them." 
</P>
<P>
And Walters said she warned board members in May, 1989, when all but she voted 
to settle a teachers strike by giving raises of 8% a year for three years. She 
said that teachers deserved the money but that she did not see how the district 
could afford it, especially if the result was to cut other jobs and badly 
needed school services. 
</P>
<P>
"Folks sit there and complain they have no choices," Walters said. "Well, they 
did have choices last year." 
</P>
<P>
Others, including Furutani, say it is irresponsible and inaccurate to blame 
teacher salary increases for the entire, complicated budget problem. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the result of many problems, some of which were there long before many 
of us were even on the board," Furutani said. 
</P>
<P>
Angered at being blamed for the district's budget problems and worried about 
what will happen when their contract expires in another year, United 
Teachers-Los Angeles and other unions have refused the district's request to 
reopen negotiations on this year's salaries and benefits. UTLA has repeatedly 
infuriated district officials by accusing them of "hiding" money and refusing 
to cut administrative "fat." 
</P>
<P>
But recently, acknowledging that the district will be in dire financial straits 
without some help from Sacramento, union leaders joined district officials and 
parents in a campaign to get more state dollars.

WHERE THE CUTS MAY FALL 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the more controversial budget cuts the Los Angeles Board of 
Education is considering as it struggles to erase a projected $220-million gap 
between spending and revenues in the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: SAVINGS 
</P>
<P>
* Cut school police patrols by eliminating 14 unfilled positions and cutting 
131 campus security aide jobs: $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Cut custodial services by 15%, with the resulting loss of 386 jobs. 
Classrooms would be swept every third day instead of every other day and would 
be vacuumed once every three weeks: $12.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Cut maintenance services by 6.3%, eliminating 112 jobs and forcing further 
delays in replacing broken windows and in fixing heating, plumbing, classroom 
and playground equipment and other facility problems: $6.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Cut instructional supports -- such as counselors and librarians -- at junior 
and senior high schools, a loss of 274 positions: $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Cut the number of assistant principals by 56, resulting in less time for 
working with students, parents, teachers and other staff members and increasing 
the duties of other campus administrators: $3.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Eliminate district-sponsored after-school and weekend playground programs at 
senior high schools and reducing them at junior highs: $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Eliminate bus transportation at 28 schools plus a center for pregnant 
students for those who live too far away to walk, cannot get public 
transportation or whose route to school is dangerous: $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Take the California Lottery funds that are distributed to local schools to 
spend as they wish and use the money to help reduce the expected deficit; many 
schools would be deprived of their only "discretionary" funds to buy extra 
equipment or programs for their students: $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Eliminate the smaller class sizes for regular classes that include some 
special education students, eliminating 98 teaching jobs: $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Cut by 15% the instructional materials budgets for kindergarten through 
eighth-grade classes and for special education classes: $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Increase class sizes by two students each in grades 11 and 12, eliminating 
130 teaching positions: $4.8 million.

GANG SWEEPS EARN LOW MARKS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SOUTH L.A.-AREA RESIDENTS ARE UNIMPRESSED BY POLICE ACTION AGAINST 
BLOODS AND CRIPS HERE AND NATIONWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
On the streets of South-Central Los Angeles, in the storefront churches, at the 
seedy liquor stores and outside the modest but well-kept bungalows, the name of 
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms does not ring many bells. 
</P>
<P>
Few residents, from the matronly ladies dressed in their Sunday finest to the 
street-wise hoods in their low-slung jeans, were even aware that ATF agents had 
just completed a high-profile crackdown on Los Angeles-based street gangs and 
their counterparts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But the one thing most everyone knew for sure is that the gang problem has 
become so complex and deeply rooted that the arrest of 174 suspected Bloods and 
Crips members since Thursday had done little for a solution to the violence 
that is wreaked in the African-American community each day. 
</P>
<P>
"They can send the entire FBI force down here and it won't solve the problem," 
said the Rev. Robert Taylor, who had just finished Sunday services at Beulah 
Baptist Church in Watts. "A few hundred more people are in jail this weekend, 
but the school system has 10,000 or 20,000 more children being groomed for the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Eddie Turner Jr., a muscular man with a pink shower cap, a tattooed 
teardrop and wearing a gold hoop through his left ear. The way he sees things, 
from atop his bicycle outside the BM Food Mart in Compton, police sweeps are 
nothing more than a stunt. 
</P>
<P>
"People get killed every day over here," said the 29-year-old former Crip. "But 
all of a sudden the police start rushing around and getting down on everyone, 
harassing them wherever they go. I feel that ain't right." 
</P>
<P>
The ATF crackdown, dubbed "Operation Streetsweep," targeted black gang members 
wanted on an assortment of weapons and narcotics violations in 11 states. On 
Thursday and Friday, the operation netted 135 suspects in Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. It also triggered several 
other anti-gang sweeps in Southern California, including a miniature version of 
"Operation Hammer" by Los Angeles police that resulted in the arrest of 94 over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's trying to get in on the act," said Adrian McThadden, 38, an 
unemployed computer programmer, who was sitting with friends outside a house on 
Piru Street in Compton. "Sometimes I think they're doing it more for themselves 
than for the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, along busy Central Avenue, Lashan Taylor and her three cousins agreed 
that locking up gangbangers did not do any good. 
</P>
<P>
"When they get out, they just go back to doing the same old thing," said the 
20-year-old hair stylist. "They should put them all in the Coliseum or Sports 
Arena and let them fight it out until they all beat each other." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't hard to find people who would tell you what the real problems are: 
broken families, no jobs, poor education and prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
But until some concrete steps are taken to address those deficits, say people 
like James Williams, don't expect maneuvers like "Operation Streetsweep" to win 
any points. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a war in this town," said Williams, 50, who spent the day 
with a dozen friends in front of the W. L. Johnson Hardware store. "You've got 
to be for real if you're going to stop it."

The owner of a $150-million communications satellite stranded in a useless 
orbit, International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, agreed 
Wednesday to pay NASA about $90 million to mount a bold spacewalk rescue 
mission during the 1992 maiden flight of the shuttle Endeavour. NASA has 
tentatively scheduled the flight for February, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Endeavour is also scheduled to carry a science satellite into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The Intelsat 6 spacecraft, the most powerful commercially built television, 
telephone and data relay satellite ever built, was stranded in a useless orbit 
March 14 when it failed to separate properly from the second stage of its Titan 
3 launch rocket because of a faulty Titan ejection system. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to get the satellite away from the spent second stage was to 
separate it from an on-board rocket that was to have boosted the relay station 
toward its planned orbit 22,300 miles above the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue plan calls for Endeavour to carry a new "perigee kick motor" into 
orbit. After the shuttle completes a rendezvous, two space-walking astronauts 
will attach the satellite to the motor.

University of Utah President Chase N. Peterson is retiring at the end of the 
next academic year, largely because of his role in the cold fusion controversy. 
Researchers at the university announced last year that they had developed a 
simple, table-top apparatus that produced more energy than it consumed, 
presumably through a fusion reaction similar to that which fuels the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson has been a vocal proponent of the concept. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, controversy erupted when it became known that a $500,000 donation 
to the school's fusion research center that had been characterized by the 
university as an "anonymous" outside gift actually was the result of a 
Peterson-authorized transfer of money from the school's Research Foundation. 
Peterson on June 1 said that hiding the origin of the donation was a mistake. 
He said he had hoped to avoid jealousy within other departments, but had "hurt 
the credibility of the institute." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson was also criticized for his role in a another funding imbroglio. In 
June, Salt Lake medical equipment manufacturer James L. Sorenson donated $15 
million in pharmaceutical stock to the university with the understanding that 
the medical school and hospital would be renamed in his honor. Peterson was 
forced to return the donation after protests from doctors, faculty and 
students.

If Earth's temperature rises as much as some scientists project, sea levels may 
increase by one foot or more in some areas in the next 50 years, scientists 
said last week. Using a computer model, German researchers examined the oceans' 
response to a global temperature increase of about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit over 
50 years if current rates of carbon dioxide emissions continue. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide is a so-called greenhouse gas because it can act like the glass 
windows of a greenhouse to trap heat in Earth's atmosphere, increasing the 
planet's temperature. 
</P>
<P>
The German simulation looked only at how a warmer climate would affect the flow 
and volume of existing sea water, which expands as the temperature increases. 
The study did not include the greater melting of glaciers and polar ice sheets, 
which could be expected to push sea levels even higher. 
</P>
<P>
In their study published in the journal Nature, scientists from Max Planck 
Meteorology Institute in Hamburg, West Germany, calculated the overall sea 
level rise because of thermal expansion would be 7.5 inches in 50 years.

"I haven't felt a thing, felt it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 -- President George Bush, after he learned he was at risk for glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
If George Bush hadn't been President -- and under the watchful care of his own 
personal physician -- he might very well have not bothered to see an 
ophthalmologist since he hadn't "felt a thing." Instead of discovering he had 
ocular hypertension (elevated pressure within the eye that can lead to 
glaucoma) before it caused any detectable symptoms, Bush might have become one 
of the statistics that has made glaucoma the leading cause of blindness in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 8 million Americans are at risk of vision damage from glaucoma. 
Almost a quarter-million have already lost sight in one eye, and another 70,000 
are completely blind, because of the disease. Just what causes this devastating 
eye disorder is still not known, despite extensive research -- but researchers 
do know that the greatest risk factor for glaucoma is simply getting older. The 
disease occurs most often in those over 40, and affects 3% of those 65 and 
over. This risk is compounded by a family history of the condition, diabetes, 
myopia (nearsightedness), and among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
It is not until extensive -- and irreversible -- damage has occurred that 
glaucoma causes noticeable symptoms. In its earliest stages, as Bush reported, 
afflicted people do not feel or notice anything unusual. But during this 
symptom-free time, a lot is going on within the eye that, if left untreated, 
could lead to blindness. Fortunately, an ophthalmologist can detect early 
changes before sufferers are aware of them -- which is why annual visits are so 
important after the age of 40. 
</P>
<P>
The lens and cornea of the eye are the only parts of the body with no blood 
supply. Constantly flowing between the lens and the cornea is a clear fluid 
called the aqueous humor, which carries nutrients and washes away waste 
products When all is working well, this wash of fluid is carefully calibrated 
by the body so that a constant pressure is maintained in the eyeball. About one 
teaspoon of aqueous humor is produced each day, and the fluid is replaced every 
two hours. 
</P>
<P>
In open-angle glaucoma (the most common type, for which Bush is at risk), 
drainage of the aqueous humor is partially blocked or impaired, so that this 
equilibrium is shifted. Because of the anatomy of the eye, the aqueous humor 
cannot simply flow out, like tears. Instead, the surplus builds up in the 
eyeball, and pressure within it rises (ocular hypertension). If pressure is 
elevated long enough, cells in the optic nerve are compressed and can die, 
resulting in vision loss. At this point, the condition has progressed to 
glaucoma. (Closed-angle glaucoma is an acute, emergency condition caused by 
sudden structural changes in the eye, and requires immediate surgery.) 
</P>
<P>
Initially, increased pressure in the eye leads to a decrease in peripheral 
(out-of-the-corner-of-the-eye) vision. This loss is not detectable in its early 
stages; on a standard eye test, a person could have 20/20 vision and still have 
glaucoma. A special test that measures pressure within the eye, called 
tonometry, is necessary -- and is best done by an ophthalmologist every year. 
To do the procedure, an ophthalmologist applies an anesthetic to the cornea and 
places a special instrument there momentarily to measure the force necessary to 
indent a small area of the cornea. In addition, the doctor examines the optic 
disc (the visible portion of the optic nerve) for evidence of damage. If either 
of these tests indicates the possibility of glaucoma, the patient will then 
need a visual field test, which can detect specific areas of vision loss. The 
results of these three exams are weighed to determine if the patient needs 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In a 24-hour period, normal eye pressure may vary, ranging between 12 and 18 
millimeters of mercury (mm Hg); pressures 21 mm Hg or higher are generally 
considered abnormal. However, there is some debate about when pressure is high 
enough to warrant treatment. Abnormal pressures do not necessarily mean that 
nerve cells have been damaged. The pressure at which, say, Bush would suffer 
damage may be different from that at which, say, Soviet President Mikhail 
Gorbachev would be affected. At the very least, closer monitoring is in order 
if eye pressure is elevated. 
</P>
<P>
The first line of treatment for glaucoma, when detected at an early stage, is 
medicated eyedrops. The drops relieve pressure in one of two ways: by enabling 
more aqueous humor to leave the eye, or by decreasing the production of aqueous 
humor. Glaucoma eyedrops are medication, just like pills, and can cause side 
effects. They should be included when giving a doctor or pharmacist a list of 
the medications a person uses. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, glaucoma proceeds slowly, especially when it is partly arrested 
with drops. However, if the condition worsens, several different types of drops 
may be needed, which increase the likelihood of side effects. If vision 
continues to deteriorate despite medication, surgery -- sometimes with lasers 
-- can be used to open the drain or create an artificial opening. 
</P>
<P>
The course of glaucoma can be unpredictable. To prevent, detect and treat it 
entails commitment to your eyes. As one medical journal put it: "Management of 
glaucoma depends as much on careful observation and consistent follow-up as it 
does on treatment by medical, laser, or surgical techniques. The patient shares 
the responsibility for a satisfactory long-term program." 
</P>
<P>
HOW EYE PRESSURE BUILDS 
</P>
<P>
Aqueous humor -- the fluid that provides nutrients and carries away waste from 
the eye -- flows through the anterior chamber between the lens and cornea. It 
drains through a sponge-like trabecular meshwork, and then is funneled through 
a passageway, called the Canal of Schlemm, to the body's circulatory system. If 
the trabecular meshwork becomes clogged, drainage is impaired and eye pressure 
results.

DONALD COOLLY FORCES A PLAYOFF; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. OPEN: HE WILL PLAY IRWIN, WHO WAITS TWO HOURS FOR TOURNAMENT OUTCOME AFTER 
MAKING 45-FOOT BIRDIE PUTT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hale Irwin ran ecstatically around the 18th green at the Medinah Country Club 
Sunday after making what he estimated to be a 45-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
He knew then that he had a chance to win the U.S. Open. He was eight under par 
for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Donald was still on the course at nine under, and Britain's Nick Faldo 
was eight under after a birdie on the 14th hole. 
</P>
<P>
So Irwin, who started almost two hours ahead of Donald, had to wait. He could 
win outright, lose or be involved in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Donald got the only bogey of his round on the 16th hole, but parred the last 
two holes for an eight-under total of 280, forcing an 18-hole playoff today. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, the two-time Masters champion, is usually a strong contender on the 
final round of major championships. 
</P>
<P>
He was again Sunday on a warm, humid day. However, he bogeyed the difficult 
par-four, 426-yard 16th and finished at seven under, a third-place tie with 
with Billy Ray Brown. Faldo shot a three-under-par 69. 
</P>
<P>
If experience counts, Irwin would have the edge in a playoff. He won the U.S. 
Open in 1974 and 1979, and, at 45, he would become the oldest Open winner if he 
wins again. 
</P>
<P>
Donald, 34, has won only one tournament, the Anheuser Busch last year, in a 
career that began in 1980. Yet he proved Sunday that he was a cool competitor 
under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Win, lose, or draw I'm a winner," Donald said, "but I'd like to be a big 
winner tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The 18-hole playoff begins at 11 a.m. PDT. The last playoff was in 1988 when 
Curtis Strange beat Faldo at the Brookline Country Club in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Strange, the two-time defending champion, didn't charge Sunday. He started his 
round two strokes behind the third-round leaders, Donald and Brown, and shot a 
three-over-par 75. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't play today. I just didn't have it," Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom has there been a more joyous scene at the Open than Irwin's reaction to 
his birdie putt that had to go over a mound while sliding fast to the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin ran madly around the green. He slapped hands with spectators and blew 
kisses. 
</P>
<P>
He made his entrance into the interview tent by jogging delightedly again. 
</P>
<P>
"In my 22 plus years of professional golf I have never made a putt like that to 
win, or come close to winning . . . in a tournament of this magnitude," Irwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin has said that his putting hasn't been the best part of his game lately. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had a difficult putt over a hump," he said. "However, I felt 
comfortable at that distance rather than 12 to 18 feet. I hung it out about 
five feet and it trickled down. It went in sweet as a baby's kiss." 
</P>
<P>
As for his emotional reaction to his putt, Irwin said: 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it was something planned. I don't know how you can remain stoic 
after doing something like that. I certainly couldn't and didn't. There was no 
way I could contain my own excitement." 
</P>
<P>
Donald was faced with a similar putt when he reached the 18th green. It was 
about a 50-footer over the mound. 
</P>
<P>
He gave it a good run, the ball going three feet past the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"It was dead straight, but it wasn't a gimme," said Donald of his three-footer. 
</P>
<P>
He then calmly stroked the ball into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin started the round four shots behind the leaders. He was even par after 
the first nine holes, and then he made consecutive birdies at the 11th, 12th, 
13th and 14th holes to charge into contention. With his birdie at No. 18, he 
finished with a five-under-par round of 67. 
</P>
<P>
Donald was the outright Open leader through 15 holes after a fast start when he 
birdied the par-four, 385-yard first hole and the par-three, 180-yard second 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a pretty boring round, but it's the kind of a round you have to 
play in the U.S. Open," said Donald, who finished with a one-under 71. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the former NCAA champion from the University of Houston, has been 
playing on the tour for only three years. 
</P>
<P>
He got a bogey at the 16th to drop to six under. However, he recovered on the 
the 17th, a par three of 168 yards over water with a sloping green and bunker 
at the back that has menaced players all week. 
</P>
<P>
He hit his nine-iron two feet from the hole and then sank his putt for a 
birdie. He had a chance to get into the playoff if he could get a birdie at the 
18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 15-foot putt that didn't break in for him as he expected, the ball 
sliding past the hole. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Brown then tapped in a two-footer for his par and a share of 
third place. 
</P>
<P>
Before Brown attempted his birdie putt, Donald said to him, "Make it." 
</P>
<P>
"That showed so much class," Brown said later. "That meant a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his encouraging Brown on the 18th green, Donald said: "It's his 
dream, too. He deserved to make it. I could still win in a playoff and, if I 
missed mine (putt), I'd lose." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who shot a par 72, said he wasn't sure that he would hold up under the 
pressure of playing in his first Open, and he was relieved that he did. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin has cut down on his tournament commitments in recent years while 
designing golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he is seemingly at his best on Open courses. He also finished 
third in the 1975 Open when it was held at Medinah. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel Hale Irwin is ready to be put away," Irwin said. "I still feel 
that I'm competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the fact that he would be the oldest Open winner if he beats Donald 
in a playoff, Irwin grinned and said, "It's nice to have an asterisk." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Floyd became the oldest Open champion at 43 when he won at Shinnecock 
Hills (Southampton, N.Y.) in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin was given a special exemption to play in this year's Open. His 10-year 
exemption after winning the 1979 Open had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin said if he hadn't been given the exemption he still would have tried to 
qualify for the Open. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has an edge over Irwin because of the age gap, 45 to 34, Donald 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so. Hale is in great shape. He has been one of the best players 
for 20 years and has played all over the world. He plays a lot like I do. We 
don't play the power game. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be match play situation tomorrow, and I will go out and play the same 
way I did today, just hit fairways and greens," Donald said. "Sounds boring, 
but that's what the U.S. Open is all about. If I try to stuff it down his 
throat I will end up stuffing it down my throat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a chance of a lifetime and I'm going out to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman, Tim Simpson and Mark Brooks finished in a tie for fifth at 283. 
When Norman, who was grouped with Hale Irwin, came into the interview tent, he 
said, "I guarantee you that Hale Irwin has won the tournament." Not yet, 
anyway. Norman had a final round of 69. . . . Jack Nicklaus and Seve 
Ballesteros each had a final round of 76 and finished at 289. Phil Mickelson, 
20, of San Diego, was the low amateur at 288. He won the 1989 NCAA championship 
while playing for Arizona State. . . . Today's playoff winner will get 
$220,000.

JIM MURRAY: DONALD? THERE WAS NEVER A DOUBT

MEDINAH, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who in the world -- in his right mind -- would ever pick Mike Donald to win a 
U.S. Open? 
</P>
<P>
His mother? No, she was on hand, looking worried every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas? Don't be silly. They're too smart for that. This is a guy who has 
won only one tournament in 11 years on tour. This isn't one of your megastars. 
</P>
<P>
An Open isn't that easy to win. Arnold Palmer won only one. Jack Nicklaus won 
four -- in 34 tries. Sam Snead never won any. And he had more tournament 
victories than anyone who ever played the game. 
</P>
<P>
So who would pick a Mike Donald out of this Open crowd? 
</P>
<P>
You're looking at him. Little old me. I picked Mike Donald last Tuesday, two 
days before tee-off, when USA Today asked me who I liked to win the Open. 
</P>
<P>
I had him all to myself. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I have missed sports prognostications. I liked Denver in several Super 
Bowls. I thought Sonny Liston would beat Muhammad Ali. I liked San Francisco in 
the Series last year. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm still alive with Mike Donald. 
</P>
<P>
When that paper asked me for my pick and printed it, one of the people who 
thought it was funny was Mike Donald. 
</P>
<P>
Not any more. Mike is alive and well in this U.S. Open. Nobody's won it yet, 
but Mike Donald is one of two golfers who can in a playoff for the championship 
today. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:55 p.m. Chicago time Sunday, Hale Irwin won this U.S. Open for the third 
time. Or thought he had. 
</P>
<P>
There were still 26 players on the course at the time. But they still had 
Medinah's Hall of Horrors -- Nos. 15, 16, 17 and 18 -- left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin knew these sociopaths were laden with bogeys and heartaches. He had made 
a 45-foot putt on No. 18 to go eight under par and, even though there was a 
fellow out there who was nine under, Hale wasn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
Hale wasn't worried because the fellow was Mike Donald, and Hale was, 
doubtless, one of the ones who who wouldn't pick Mike Donald. In fact, Hale 
obviously threw out Nick Faldo, Curtis Strange, all the Simpsons and Joneses 
and anyone else out there with a three-iron in his hand. When he sank his 
sea-going monster putt on 18, Hale took off on a victory gallop that took him 
around and around the green, high-fiving the officials, blowing kisses to the 
crowd and acting like a man who had won a lottery -- or his third U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Hale liked the idea of being able to sit there in the clubhouse and watch the 
field crash and burn out there. Hale knew the wind was up, the greens were 
drying out, and, if Hale was worrying about anybody on the golf course, it sure 
wouldn't be Mike Donald. 
</P>
<P>
Hale could see what the course was doing to his playing partner, the great Greg 
Norman. He knew what Medinah was capable of -- chopping down your swing, 
scaring you with lightning-fast greens, inviting you to yawning traps with 
downhill slopes in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
Hale buzzed happily down to the media center and scampered a few more victory 
laps down there. All he had to do was wait two hours and get his victory speech 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
He was almost right. The Faldos, Stranges, Jack Nicklauses and Seve 
Ballesteroses fired and fell back. The course had them in its withering 
crossfire. They were being cut down on the barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
But here came Mike Donald. He was dodging bullet after bullet. The guy who was 
70 lifetime tournaments behind Nicklaus, 16 behind Hale Irwin and about $4 
million in lifetime earnings behind Curtis Strange was not wilting. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he cracked. The par-four 16th, a boomerang-shaped torture chamber that 
has more trees on it than some rain forests, mugged him. He had a three-iron to 
the pin for his second shot to a green that looked like something that fell off 
a letter. A three-iron is harder to hit than a house fly in a hot, dark room, 
and Mike Donald dumped it in a sand trap. You knew he was looking at his first 
bogey of the round. But maybe not his last. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 is not a golf hole. It's a public enemy. 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Donald did not give in. He remembers turning to his brother, Pete, who 
was caddying for him. "I could feel my heart really pounding," he recalled. "I 
got goose bumps. I thought, 'This is the Open!' But I told my brother, 'This is 
what I've practiced for 20 years for. This is why I've hit all those balls, 
stroked all those putts.' I said to myself, 'Now, don't get wishy-washy. Just 
play the way you've been playing for 70 holes for two more.' " 
</P>
<P>
He did. He parred in to the clubhouse. He didn't do any dancing on the green, 
he didn't circle the traps (although he had given some thought to somersaulting 
on the apron if he sank his birdie putt). He simply stood there where nobody 
(well, almost nobody) thought he would. Tied for the, by God, lead in the 
United States Open. 
</P>
<P>
And today? Well, he's spotting Hale Irwin two U.S. Opens and a lot of 
experience. But Hale Irwin is spotting him 11 years. Irwin would be the oldest 
winner in Open history. Mike Donald would only be one of the least expected. 
</P>
<P>
If he wins, I'll try not to say I told you so. Nobody likes know-it-alls. But I 
had him in the pool, too.

LENDL SHOWS BECKER HE'S READY FOR WIMBLEDON

<TEXT>
<P>
Ivan Lendl prepared himself for the Wimbledon title he has never won by beating 
three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker, 6-3, 6-2, Sunday for his second 
consecutive victory in the Queens Court grass court tournament at London. 
</P>
<P>
It was Lendl's first victory over Becker on grass and the West German said that 
Lendl played an errorless game on the surface that has frustrated him for so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
"He just played like a perfect player on grass today," Becker said. "One good 
thing about today, he can't play better." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl lost to Becker in the 1986 Wimbledon final and the last two years in the 
semifinals. This victory, just eight days before Wimbledon's opening day, makes 
Lendl the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"Before this match, everybody expected me to win. Now we are even," Becker 
said. "This puts a bit more pressure on his back now that everybody has seen 
that he can play very well on grass." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl swept five matches in the tournament without losing a set, including a 
6-2, 6-4 victory over John McEnroe in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
It was evidence that his two months of exclusive grass court practice, first in 
Australia, at home in Greenwich, Conn., and then for the last three weeks in 
England, could pay off with his first Wimbledon title. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing so much better overall and so much differently than last 
Wimbledon," said Lendl, who won $62,250 for the 1-hour 14-minute win. "This 
easily was the best week I've had on grass, putting five matches together like 
this. Things have been going so well I can't think about anything to complain 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Zina Garrison defeated Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 6-1, to win a 
women's grass court tournament at Birmingham, England, and said she believes 
she can win the biggest grass court championship of all -- Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison needed only 63 minutes to win her first tournament of the season. She 
had reached just one other final, losing to Martina Navratilova in an indoor 
tournament in Washington, D.C., and was eliminated early in the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
Her serve kept Sukova on the defensive throughout the match. Garrison returned 
serve well and ran down Sukova's hardest shots, and pronounced herself ready to 
try for her first Grand Slam tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can keep that up anything is possible -- even winning Wimbledon," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Her best showing at the All-England Lawn and Tennis Club was in 1985 when she 
reached the semifinals. She was eliminated in the second round last year. 
</P>
<P>
Magnus Larsson of Sweden defeated Lawson Duncan, 6-7, 7-5, 6-0, to win a 
$250,000 tournament at Florence, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Larsson won $32,400; Duncan won $19,090. 
</P>
<P>
Amos Mansdorf of Israel defeated Aleksander Volkov of the USSR, 6-3, 7-6, to 
win a grass court tournament at Rosmalen, the Netherlands.

MORNING BRIEFING: U.S. CUP TEAM CAN AT LEAST ESCAPE CELLAR

<P>
The United States might not be the worst team in the World Cup. The United Arab 
Emirates is edging the United States in the Cup's first tiebreaker for last 
place -- the margin of goals scored. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has scored once and given up six goals, a differential of 
minus-five. The United Arab Emirates has scored once but given up seven goals, 
a minus-six. 
</P>
<P>
Each has one more game to play Thursday -- the United States against Austria 
and the United Arab Emirates against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates has a national population of 1.4 million. The United 
States population is 250 million. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: When was the last time the United States won an Olympic gold medal 
in men's basketball outside of North America? 
</P>
<P>
Sweet revenge: Earl Strom, who is slipping into retirement after 33 years of 
officiating pro basketball, told this to Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening 
Sun: "Know what I'm going to do next season? Go to games and boo the referees." 
</P>
<P>
Very L.A.: Jockey Karen Rogers, in the Belmont winner's circle with Dame de 
Soleil for her first victory since being injured in a racing mishap last 
September, had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank (trainer) Red Terrill; my agent, Dominick Delvecchio; and my 
therapist, Lenny Framson -- he put me back together." 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept: Since 1983, USC has won the same number of Pacific 
10 Conference basketball championships as UCLA -- one. 
</P>
<P>
Strike a pose: The vogue for the 1990 World Cup is black thigh-huggers that 
peep out from under the shorts in the manner of tennis star Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers say the aim of the shorts -- similar to those worn by cyclists -- 
is to support the thighs and keep the legs cool when hot and warm when cold. 
</P>
<P>
Questionably vogue: Goalkeepers, who tend to favor longer padded shorts to 
cushion the impact of dives, wear huge gloves these days with a variety of 
surfaces to suit the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1934, most keepers would merely spit on their bare hands and hope for the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
Why not?: Despite being a highly touted college quarterback, Notre Dame's Tony 
Rice was not drafted this year by the NFL. Apparently the feeling among scouts 
was that his arm isn't strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Rice was picked in the 50th round of the June draft by the Angels as a 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Rice has never played baseball, either at Notre Dame or at Woodruff High in 
South Carolina, where, besides football, he lettered in basketball and track. 
</P>
<P>
And on the day he was drafted by the Angels, Rice signed a two-year contract 
with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: 1964 at Toyko. 
</P>

U.S. PLAYERS NEED EUROPEAN STYLE, MIDFIELDER SAYS

TIRRENIA, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only way the United States is going to become competitive in future World 
Cup tournaments is by sending players to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
So says U.S. midfielder Tab Ramos, perhaps the most accomplished of the 22 
American players in Italy and certainly the most realistic about the state of 
soccer in North America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really, really important that we try to have a lot of players go overseas 
after this World Cup because we need to take that next step," Ramos said at the 
U.S. team's training camp in Tirrenia, where it is preparing for Tuesday 
night's game against Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, from Hillside, N.J., started and played well in each of the United 
States' first two matches -- a 5-1 loss to Czechoslovakia in Florence and a 1-0 
loss to Italy in Rome. Unlike some American players, he was not surprised by 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
"I know some people on the team said we haven't played as well as we can, but I 
think we did a good job," he said. "In my viewpoint, we did just about as well 
as we can do. 
</P>
<P>
"As I said before the Cup, we might come out here and play our best game every 
game and lose 3-0 or 4-0. That's just the way it is. Tactically, we're not as 
sound as these teams, and physically we're not as sound, either. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do everything we can to win, but we're outmatched in all 
aspects of the game, and that's something we have to learn. It's a reality; 
it's not something to be ashamed of. We've come through our system at home, and 
our system is not prepared to take on the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a great accomplishment for our team to be here and to come to 
the World Cup. We're going to learn from every game and then take it from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
What that means is using the four years between now and the 1994 World Cup in 
the United States to raise the standard of American play. Ramos says it can 
best be done by encouraging and helping U.S. players join professional teams 
overseas. And even then it's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
"If you come out of college and you're college player of the year, at this 
(World Cup) level it means absolutely nothing," Ramos said. "All it means is 
you might get a trial with a reserve team somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Four members of the current U.S. squad have pro experience in Europe: Forward 
Peter Vermes plays for F.C. Vollendam in Holland; forward Chris Sullivan played 
for Rabo Eto in Hungary and said he probably will join a team in Belgium after 
the World Cup; midfielder Paul Caligiuri played for S.V. Meppen in West Germany 
and forward Bruce Murray played for F.C. Luzern in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Three others -- Ramos, midfielder John Harkes and goalkeeper Tony Meola -- were 
given tryouts by teams in the English League earlier this year and could join 
European clubs after the World Cup. Ramos, in fact, already has an offer on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been talking to a team (believed to be Roda S.C.) in the Netherlands for 
the last three weeks," he said. "They've offered me a three-year contract, but 
I don't want to commit for that long a time." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the loss to the Czechs might have hurt some players' chances of 
gaining a pro contract. If a club is interested in a player, he said, it looks 
for individual skills and tries to assess them in view of its needs. How the 
U.S. team performs is not necessarily a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does Ramos believe the United States is thought of as a pushover by the 
other teams in its group. 
</P>
<P>
"If other teams think of us in that manner, then that's their problem, or their 
prerogative," he said. "I think we're still a good team. We have our best 
players from America here. We try to do our best. We know that when we go back 
home we're still going to be the best players there. 
</P>
<P>
"So you have to put things in perspective. It's nice to play at home where you 
can sort of be a star in your own country, but now we're facing the world, and 
when we face the world the United States is a brand-new country when it comes 
to soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, where his father played 
professionally, was an All-American at St. Benedict's Prep in Newark, N.J., and 
at North Carolina State. He first played for the Under-20 National Team when he 
was 15 and has been a regular on one U.S. team or another since then. 
</P>
<P>
He represented the United States in the 1983 World Youth Championships in 
Mexico, the 1983 Pan American Games in Venezuela, the 1988 Olympic Games in 
Seoul, South Korea, and the first Five-a-Side (Indoor) World Championships in 
the Netherlands last year. 
</P>
<P>
He is a creative force in the U.S. midfield, with the ability to take on 
opponents one-on-one and to beat them with skillful dribbling or a quick change 
of pace or direction. He said he already has learned a lot from this World Cup, 
but the memory of the opening game against the Czechs remains the most vivid. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that caught me and got me really excited was our bus ride to the 
stadium," he said. "We kept seeing Czech flags all over the city and people 
walking around with Czech flags. Then we got to the stadium and saw all those 
American flags. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to tell you, we were as ready for that game as anyone will ever be. We 
came out and for the first 20 minutes we played as well as we can play. We had 
a couple of opportunities to score, but we didn't. That's the way it goes. Over 
the 90 minutes, the Czechs were a much better team and that's why they won. 
</P>
<P>
"The intensity at the World Cup is a lot higher. Every player goes all-out on 
every play. Every play is very important to every player. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the experience I got out of the game was that every time I got the 
ball I got fouled. That's just the bottom line. Whether there was a call or 
whether I got away from the guy, I still got fouled. That's something that we 
have to learn at home. That's something that our leagues have to bring up. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they (top international teams) cool the game down is by fouling every 
time you start to attack. It's not a bad foul, it's just something that stops 
the play and allows the whole defense to get back and it's very hard for us to 
penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think on one play my shirt stretched about five yards. I was about five 
yards ahead of the guy. There wasn't a (holding) foul called there. It's just 
something you have to get used to, and that's why I really do want to play in 
Europe. It takes a lot of experience. I think with a year or two under my belt 
I will do better in the next Cup if I get the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the other countries playing in the World Cup have little or no 
comprehension of the difficulties American players have to overcome, most 
noticeable being the lack of a viable professional league in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the other teams have no idea what we've gone through," he said. "If we 
were any other country and we lost, 5-1, we couldn't go home. We're in a 
situation where if we lose (all three matches), we'll go home and at Kennedy 
Airport people won't know who we are anyway." 
</P>
<P>
A prime example of the relative anonymity of the U.S. players occurred last 
November when the team left Florida for its final, vital qualifying match 
against Trinidad and Tobago, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we left Miami Airport, the lady at the counter said, 'Will the Miami 
Soccer Club please get on the plane.' And when we got to Trinidad there were 
5,000 fans at the airport yelling and screaming, 'No way, U.S.A.' at 1 o'clock 
in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the difference. In other countries, when the national team plays, the 
whole country shuts down. Our country's just too big for that. There's too many 
other things going on. Soccer will never be as big as it is in other countries, 
but I think there's a little room for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer is a way of life everywhere but in the United States. It's something 
you live with. Your team loses, you cry. Your team wins, you don't even go to 
work because you're so happy. You just want to yell and scream all day. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way it is. It'll never be that way (in the United States), but 
hopefully we'll get the sport to the point where people will want to go watch 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important thing is going to be after 1994. Because the 
American people are going to love the World Cup in 1994. They just are. It's a 
great event and they're going to love every game." 
</P>
<P>
Before that happens, however, a little education must take place, Ramos said, 
and the U.S. players must play a key role. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the scope of this World Cup is something that Americans have really no 
idea about," he said. "They don't know what a World Cup is all about. That's 
not something to be frustrated about; that's something that's going to take 
years. I think during the next four years it's very important that our players 
do their job not only on the field trying to become better players but also off 
the field in trying to promote the game. By 1994, hopefully with the guys 
playing in Europe, we'll have a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
Another crucial element, Ramos said, is the success of the American 
Professional Soccer League, still a fledgling outfit at the moment but vital to 
the sport's future in North America after the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't catch up by then," Ramos said, "then we really have no hope."

Captain Jan Ceulemans finished off an impressive night of offensive ingenuity 
with a goal while his team was down one man on Sunday, helping Belgium to a 3-1 
victory over Uruguay and into the second round of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Defender Eric Gerets was ejected just before halftime. But Ceulemans stunned 
Uruguay with a 20-yard shot in the first minute of the second half. Lei 
Clijsters and Enzo Scifo had scored in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan substitute Pablo Bengoechea scored in the 73rd minute when Belgium 
was momentarily playing with nine men because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Scifo had his second strong game in a row to put Belgium among the top 
contenders for the championship. The Belgians have four points in Group E -- 
they also beat South Korea, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Enzo Francescoli and Ruben Sosa, Uruguay mounted a steady attack against 
Belgium in the second half. But Belgium stayed back and packed its defense to 
limit the Uruguayans' space. 
</P>
<P>
"It fully deserved the win," Uruguay Coach Oscar Tabarez said of Belgium. "They 
made no errors, we made a lot in defense." 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay meets South Korea in the final first-round match Thursday, while 
Belgium goes against Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Clijsters finished off a combination play with a powerful 
header to give Belgium the lead in the 14th minute. Ceulemans set up a 
give-and-go with Bruno Versavel and then sent Michel De Wolf deep on the left 
wing. The defender passed to the other side to a charging Clijsters. 
</P>
<P>
The second goal was a solo effort by Scifo, who scored on a swerving 
right-footed drive of 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The early expulsion created lots of problems for us," Belgian Coach Guy Thys 
said. "We had to go back massively in defense." 
</P>
<P>
Gerets had trouble containing Sosa all night and was given a yellow card in the 
37th minute for an illegal tackle. Seven minutes and a few fouls later, Gerets 
again pulled down Sosa and was sent off. 
</P>
<P>
But Ceulemans' goal made it easy. Versavel beat three defenders on the left and 
crossed the ball to the center, where the captain was unguarded. He unleashed a 
hard shot past goalie Fernando Alvez. 
</P>
<P>
Gerets will also miss Thursday's match against Spain.

Italian police 1, English hooligans 0. 
</P>
<P>
Thus ended Sunday the crucial round of the long-awaited, heavily advertised 
Battle of Sardinia -- violent, beer-fueled street theater as a lamentable 
companion of soccer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned, however. There's more to come. The same two teams will meet again 
on Cagliari's streets Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't finished yet. Nobody is thinking about relaxing our alert," a 
police spokesman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday's game had the potential for being the most dangerous. Now that it's 
over that doesn't mean we can sit back and relax," said Graham Newsom, a 
spokesman for the British Ministry of Sport. 
</P>
<P>
The rock-throwing hooligans started strongly before Saturday night's 0-0 tie 
between England and the Netherlands, storming a police barricade in an attempt 
to tangle with peaceable Dutch fans. 
</P>
<P>
After the match, they became surly, growling but eminently movable objects 
shunted out of harm's way by an irresistible force that stopped the hooligans 
in their tracks with tear gas and baton charges. 
</P>
<P>
The winners, some 3,000 members of three national police forces, basked in 
international applause Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm grateful to the police for their swift, tough and decisive action, which 
defused this situation and prevented other incidents -- avoiding serious 
confrontation between English and Dutch supporters," said Colin B. Moynihan, 
Britain's minister for sport, in a statement here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The losers licked their bruises, flexed their tattoos, and consoled themselves 
with refreshments when a ban on the sale of alcohol expired at 8:00 a.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
One hooligan came in exactly at 8, tapping his watch to say that it was time. 
"He bought a two-liter mug of draft beer," said a barman at one waterfront 
Cagliari spa. By midday, there were knots of reeling English stalwarts along 
streets where the first skirmishes began a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The next flash point is expected to come Thursday, when England seeks to assure 
a second-round berth in a decisive match against stubborn Egypt, which tied 
Ireland, 0-0, in Palermo. After four Group F matches, all four teams are in a 
dead heat, but no more than three can advance to the Cup's second round. 
</P>
<P>
Between now and Thursday, neither police nor hooligans are likely to change 
tactics for their final encounter in Sardinia. 
</P>
<P>
The hooligans, whose rampages have made English soccer an international 
scandal, can be expected to come well-oiled, stoked to violence by a few 
skillful organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Of some 6,500 English supporters in Sardinia for the Netherlands game, there 
were 600 to 1,000 in the column that challenged police Saturday on the road to 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Police apparently knew from intelligence reports that trouble was planned, but 
not legitimate fans in the crowd who were caught in the middle when it came. 
"The majority in the group would not have known something was supposed to 
happen," Newsom said. 
</P>
<P>
"The orchestrated incident before the match was a sickening reflection that a 
mindless minority of thugs can bring English football into international 
disrepute," Moynihan said. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy of Italian police, coached by hooligan-wise British police, is to 
strike fast and hard with heavy battalions at the first sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman in police headquarters here Sunday, who declined to be identified, 
expressed satisfaction with Saturday's results. 
</P>
<P>
"They came with rocks -- looking for trouble. We relied on a very strong show 
of force and a quick reaction. It was over very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Said Newsom: "Early intervention avoided worse trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Police detained about 500 English fans after the disturbance and checked their 
identities against the list of known hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
Those who could produce game tickets were shepherded to the stadium under heavy 
escort. About 100 without tickets were turned back to downtown Cagliari and 
warned not to reassemble in large groups, Newsom said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no incidents with Dutch fans. "They have a bad reputation, but they 
have behaved well as a group in the last few years," said Lex Mellink, a 
spokesman for the Dutch police here. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of British and Dutch police, long lines of no-fare buses hustled 
up to 10,000 Dutch supporters directly from the stadium gates to out-of-town 
hotels and camp sites or to chartered planes and ferries taking them to Sicily, 
where the Netherlands plays its final first-round match against Ireland on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that there were no incidents after the game was because of the way it 
was policed," Newsom said. 
</P>
<P>
Italian police said they arrested five English fans Saturday, one of whom had a 
broken leg. They will be tried today on charges of vandalism and resisting 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
A sixth hooligan is charged with theft in an incident not related to the 
disturbance, and five others face charges of drunkenness in Cagliari. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are 31 English fans in Sardinian jails awaiting trial. Three 
others are serving short sentences, a fourth was convicted and expelled and 
eight have received suspended sentences. 
</P>
<P>
British and Italian authorities expect a core of 5,000 English fans will remain 
scattered across Sardinia until after Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Then, depending if and how England advances, the fans -- and the hooligans 
among them -- will follow their team to one of four mainland game sites: Genoa, 
Milan, Bologna or Turin. That is not good news to officials there: All four 
cities are easier to reach for low-budget English fanatics than the island 
Sardinia.

USOC MIGHT BUY EAST GERMAN SPORTS SECRETS

<P>
The United States Olympic Committee's board of directors Sunday voted to 
consider buying training and coaching technology from East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Kostanecki, chairman of the USOC's Sports Equipment and Technology 
Committee, said sweeping reforms in Eastern Europe are forcing the East Germans 
to sell their technology in order to fund their own Olympic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a technological candy store," said Kostanecki, who visited a sports 
research center in East Berlin in April. "But I'm concerned that if we sit on 
our hands too long, people will be hired away, the political atmosphere could 
change, and the window of opportunity will be closed." 
</P>
<P>
Besides developing state-of-the-art equipment for luge, sailing, canoe/kayak, 
rowing and cycling, Kostanecki said the center has developed new ways to 
measure athletes' performances. 
</P>
<P>
The East German technology won't be inexpensive, Kostanecki said, adding that 
the edge it would give America's Olympic athletes would be worth the price. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure it's worth it if you can't do it any other way," he said. "We have to 
realize that we are light years behind in some areas. This is the way you have 
to do it if you want to compete. The ways we've (won) in the past won't work in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robert Helmick, USOC president: "We have to make a decision whether to 
purchase technology and retain some of the technological experts or have our 
own system of development and delivery. My instincts say it will be more a 
program of bringing experts here to help us with development. But this is a 
changing field. It's not like buying a 100 bushels of corn." 
</P>
<P>
Helmick said the national governing body for each Olympic sport would decide 
for itself the best way to acquire the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a separate issue that will probably be answered sport by sport," he said.

Alex Solis had a hard time believing he and Peace didn't win the $109,800 
Inglewood Handicap Sunday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish all the horses I rode would run like that one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his first race in more than eight months, Peace ran well enough to improve 
his record on the Hollypark turf to 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for him, a horse coming off an even longer vacation ran a bit 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Abdu, who hadn't been seen since suffering a leg injury in the Turf 
Paradise Handicap Jan. 28, 1989, was plenty fit for his return. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring his first victory since he won the Col. F.W. Koester Handicap Oct. 23, 
1988, at Santa Anita, the 6-year-old Rusticaro horse set all the fractions, 
then held off Peace in a stretch-long duel. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, the 7-1 shot had beaten Peace, the 5-2 second choice, by a head. 
Mohamed Abdu completed the 1 1/16 miles in a rapid 1:39 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
"It just took time to get him back," said trainer Richard Mulhall after Mohamed 
Abdu won for the eighth time in 15 starts. "But he's a pretty easy horse to 
train. He will train and he will work. Just like Peace. Peace trained well. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a horse that will train and work well, then it's a lot easier to 
get him ready. Especially if it's a good horse." 
</P>
<P>
The even-money favorite in the 1989 Turf Paradise Handicap, Mohamed Abdu pulled 
a suspensory ligament in his left foreleg when he jumped over the front of the 
starting gate. "When they sprung the latch, he was hanging on the gate," 
Mulhall said. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have doubt when they're off that long. Actually, I really thought 
he was coming back better than he was before because he was a lot quieter. He 
used to be very nervous. He was a lot quieter today. He went to the gate well. 
I guess you settle down when you get old. 
</P>
<P>
"Peace made a big move at him, and I knew Gary (Stevens) hadn't asked my horse 
to run yet. They're both good horses and they ran hard. We got him this time. 
I'd been reading how Peace was unbeaten on this turf course, but that's only 
because I've never run here before," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who was aboard for Mohamed Abdu's victory in the Koester, was happy to 
see him back. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mulhall did a hell of a job getting this horse ready," he said. "He was 
dead tight. He wasn't going to let that other horse get by him. I thought it 
was going to be close (when Peace joined him), but I knew he wouldn't quit from 
riding him before. He has an awful lot of try in him. 
</P>
<P>
"I can thank Mr. Mulhall for getting me on the horse because my agent (Ray 
Kravagna) wasn't too keen on riding him because he was coming off such a long 
layoff. I'm just glad we got the opportunity. He's a very aggressive horse and 
he's all right. He sure runs great fresh." 
</P>
<P>
The American Handicap July 4 and a meeting with Steinlen could be next for 
Mohamed Abdu, but Mulhall wasn't ready to commit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility, but we'll have to see how much this took out of him," he 
said. "I've waited a year and a half with him, so I can wait a little bit 
longer if I have too." 
</P>
<P>
Classic Fame, the 7-5 favorite, rallied for third, a half-length behind Peace. 
Silent Prince, the longest shot in the field at 25-1, was fourth. Then came 
Miswaki Tern, Just As Lucky and Shining Steel, who trailed the entire way. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence and Ruhlmann, who will give Charlie Whittingham an extremely 
strong hand in Sunday's $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup, will probably have their 
final drills for the race Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the Californian in his first start as a 4-year-old, Sunday Silence 
worked a mile in 1:37 4/5 Thursday, a day before Ruhlmann went the same 
distance a second faster. "Both horses are doing well and they're coming into 
the race well," said Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
Others set to go in the Gold Cup, which is run at 1 1/4 miles, are Criminal 
Type, who has won the Pimlico Special and the Metropolitan Mile in his last two 
starts; Opening Verse, who is due to arrive at Hollywood Park today; Stylish 
Winner, the runner-up in the Californian; Mi Selecto, who is trained by Angel 
Penna and was fourth in the Pimlico Special; and Santangelo. Weights for the 
Gold Cup will be announced Tuesday. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile, who won the Golden Gate Handicap Saturday, might make her Southern 
California debut in the $250,000-added Sunset Handicap July 23, closing day at 
Hollywood Park. Trained by Ed Gregson, the 4-year-old filly had previously won 
the Yerba Buena and finished second in the Countess Fager at Golden Gate 
Fields. . . . Claimed for $80,000 by trainer Robert Marshall June 1, Solar 
Launch paid immediate dividends for his new connections Sunday. Moved back to 
the dirt after five consecutive turf races, the 3-year-old Sassafras colt beat 
his five allowance rivals by 5 1/2 lengths and equaled the track record of 1:14 
4/5 for 6 1/2 furlongs. No doubt, the record could have been his alone, but 
Kent Desormeaux geared him down in the final yards. . . . Gary Stevens won two 
other races Sunday: the fourth on 2-year-old Deposit Ticket and the sixth on 
8-1 shot Golden Voyager. Fifth in his first two starts, Golden Voyager, who was 
a $1.4 million yearling purchase, won by eight lengths in 1:34 3/5 for the 
mile. . . . Mohamed Abdu paid $17 to win and earned $64,800 for his owners 
Meyer and Mollie Gaskin and Nandor Markovic.

With Approval, Canada's 1989 Horse of the Year, remained undefeated on turf and 
established stakes and course records in winning the $188,800 Bowling Green 
Handicap for 3-year-olds and up at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Perret guided the winner to a 1 3/4-length victory over Chenin Blanc and 
the fast-closing El Senor for his fifth turf victory. 
</P>
<P>
With Approval's time of 2:10.1 on the firm Inner Turf Course bettered by 1 1/5 
seconds the time posted by Overskate in the 1979 Bowling Green. With Approval 
enjoyed a perfect trip racing third behind Chenin Blanc and Kanatiyr through 
the first mile. Midway on the turn, the four-year-old, Canadian-bred son of 
Caro-Passing Mood moved to join the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Once into the final straight, With Approval edged away in the final furlong. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, his eleventh in seventeen starts, With Approval earned 
$113,280, increasing his career earnings to $2,016,380. He returned $4.60, 
$3.20 and $3.00. Chenin Blanc paid $6.00 and $4.80 and El Senor paid $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Genius, ridden by Ricardo Lopez, drew off in the stretch to win the 
$48,510 Isaac Murphy Handicap at Arlington International Racecourse. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, Beau Genius was engaged in a duel for the lead with Black Tie 
Affair and Tom Cobbley, but was able to gain the lead turning for home. Black 
Tie Affair finished second, 4 1/4 lengths behind the winner and three lengths 
in front of the late-closing Triteamtri. 
</P>
<P>
The time for the seven-furlong race for 3-year-olds and up was 1:21 1/5, 
four-fifths of a second off the track record. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the sixth in nine starts this year for Beau Genius. All six 
victories were in stakes. The victory in the Isaac Murphy increases his career 
earnings to $520,550. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Genius returned $5.20, $2.80 and $2.40. Black Tie Affair paid $2.80 and 
$2.40. Triteamtri paid $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
Poleeced took the lead quickly and held off several challenges for a narrow 
victory in the $40,000 Victoria Handicap at Louisiana Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Angelo Trosclair, the 5-year-old daughter of Police Dust moved in 
front soon after the break of the six-furlong race for 3-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
She had a two-length lead after the first-quarter and took a one-length lead 
into the stretch, fighting off challenges by Raise A Mission and Perilous Star 
to win by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
Poleeced finished in 1:10 4/5, paying $12.40, $5.80 and $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
Raise A Mission, a 6-1 choice under David Guillory, was second throughout and 
paid $6.00 and $3.40. Perilous Star, a neck behind Raise A Mission in third, 
paid $3.00. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Steve Pelletier, Poleeced scored her ninth career victory in 28 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 10,694 bet $1,830,288 on the 11-race card.

'NIGHTINGALE' TRIPS OVER ITS CONTENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beware of the trappings. They may garnish but don't constitute Greek or any 
other tragedy. When a play makes more of an impression for its ambience than 
its content, something is rotten with the state of playwriting. 
</P>
<P>
Timberlake Wertenbaker's "The Love of a Nightingale," which opened over the 
weekend in an L.A. Theatre Works at Edgemar production (in association with Peg 
Yorkin), is dedicated to manipulating Greek myth to teach us a lesson -- the 
very same that was harshly taught to Procne and Philomele, two of Athenian King 
Pandion's three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
In the myth, Procne is given in marriage to Tereus, King of Thrace, as a reward 
for his help to Pandion in battling King Labdacus of Thebes. After the 
marriage, however, Tereus falls in love with sister-in-law Philomele, rapes her 
and cuts out her tongue so she won't accuse him. But Philomele finds a way to 
do that anyway and the sisters get vengeance. Of a sort. 
</P>
<P>
The unmerciful gods change these players into birds and fishes: Procne into a 
swallow, Philomele a nightingale (hence the play's title), Tereus a prehistoric 
hoopoe and little Itys, Procne's and Tereus' young son, into a goldfish. 
Wertenbaker doesn't alter this story but uses the power of its sexual politics 
to range freely through compelling issues of rape, conspiracy, censorship 
(symbolized here by inflicted physical silence), chauvinism, war, slavery and 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Heady stuff. 
</P>
<P>
To do this the playwright digresses only cosmetically from the original. Her 
Tereus (Robert Foxworth) is a handsome Thracian boor, a numbing jock. Her 
Philomele (Brenda Varda) is a delicate reed -- impressionable, eager, spirited, 
bendable but not breakable, despite the violence that befalls her. She 
endlessly plays out her anguish with anatomically correct dolls. When the 
lonely and repudiated Procne (Carolyn Seymour) finds her, vengeance erupts -- 
bloody and unstoppable, as much victory as defeat. 
</P>
<P>
It is a potent story that would better have served the playwright if she had 
resisted her own didacticism. Wertenbaker is very Royal Court, not just because 
she is largely a product of that London theater, but because she is so typical 
of it: highly imaginative but self-indulgent, with a tendency to proselytize 
and a habit of going unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
"We begin here because no life has ever been untouched by war," is the play's 
opening line. A good place to start. But the promise of that beginning and of 
the wittily modern exchanges that follow between King Pandion (Basil Langton) 
and his self-centered Queen (Carol Kiernan) is not fulfilled. "He wants to 
stay, I knew it," says she of Tereus, with unconcealed annoyance; nobody wants 
a guest who doesn't leave. "I'll send you some of our tutors," offers the King 
as an inducement. "Our philosophers, I'm afraid, are rather independent." It's 
a relief when all Tereus asks is to marry their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
But this lightness of touch gets a lot heavier. The play soon begins to strike 
poses and broadcast its intentions (much like "Our Country's Good" by the same 
author). The dark "forebodings" of Procne's ladies-in-waiting become 
pronouncements. Shadowy half-statements become posturings. When Procne sends 
Tereus to fetch her sister in Athens, we see the whole thing coming. 
Philomele's casual hand on Tereus thigh marshals his attention and from that 
moment all is lost. When we get to real rain on stage, watch out. 
</P>
<P>
By play's end, Wertenbaker has fallen into most of her own traps, including 
blatant preaching. She returns briefly at the close to the humor of the 
beginning, with Philomele stating flatly that she doesn't like birds or being 
one, and a final image that ends on a child's unanswered question. But it's too 
late. A lot of pretentiousness has floated past by then. 
</P>
<P>
The production, directed by Peter Mark Schifter, is as uneven as the play, 
sometimes even within individual performances affected by the ups and downs in 
the writing. Varda achieves the most modulated and unself-pitying consistency 
as Philomele. But Seymour, in the least defined of Wertenbaker's characters, 
stumbles into sing-song now and then, providing a Procne who ranges from 
affecting to phony. Much the same applies to Foxworth's laconic Tereus who, as 
written, lacks breadth as well as depth. This is a criticism of the author's 
flawed creations, not of these actors' undisputed talents. 
</P>
<P>
A good word here for Roger Guenveur Smith as a sea captain who catches 
Philomele's eye and for Lyvingston Holmes as Philomele's servant Niobe. The 
balance of the company varies as greatly as the script and the real stars are 
the production values: the distinguished multi-venued set (forgetting rain) by 
Victoria Petrovich which ranges from deserted beaches to Victorian theaters, 
lighting by Michael Gilliam, no-period costumes by Catherine Meacham and 
original music by Thomas Pasatieri. They create more mood than Wertenbaker 
dreamed of. It is not their fault if they overshadow her play.

AMERICAN ALBUM: ALMOST HOMELESS: 'MAD HOUSING' IN ATLANTA; 
</P>
<P>
THEIR VOLUNTEER-BUILT SHACKS ARE IN HIDDEN SPOTS BUT HUT-DWELLERS FEAR THEY ARE 
LIVING ON BORROWED TIME.

<P>
Huts may not be houses, but scores of Atlantans call them home. 
</P>
<P>
For three years now, a group of socially conscious architects, industrial 
designers and others, called "the Mad Housers," has been building shacks for 
homeless people. They have erected 87 of the little structures in 
out-of-the-way places around town -- near railroad tracks, under viaducts. Made 
of plywood and measuring 6 feet by 8 feet, the huts are just big enough to hold 
a cot and a few personal possessions. 
</P>
<P>
At one time the little emergency shelters, which have no running water or 
electricity, do not comply with building codes and are considered eyesores by 
many, drew the wrath of city and state officials. During high-profile events, 
such as the 1988 Democratic National Convention, some of them were evacuated. 
Some have been razed. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, a kinder and gentler era has taken hold. Nevertheless, some of the 
hut-dwellers are worried that they will be moved. They live under the Martin 
Luther King Jr. Drive viaduct near downtown and next to the construction site 
of the Georgia Dome. The $210-million, 70,500-seat facility is scheduled for 
completion in 1992 and Atlanta recently won the right to host the 1994 Super 
Bowl there. 
</P>
<P>
The sports news brought great joy to official Atlanta, and visions of the 
Olympics and the NBA All-Stars danced in Mayor Maynard Jackson's head. "This is 
just the beginning," he declared. "We're going to stage the greatest Super Bowl 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
But there was no joy under the viaduct. There was no sadness, either. Only 
cynicism and resolve, the two constant companions of the homeless and nearly 
homeless people who drop out or fall out of society and then live lives of 
repeated displacement. Here, as in other cities, the people on the bottom of 
the socioeconomic ladder often disparage urban revitalization even when they 
are promised that it will help them. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that, eventually, we will have to move," said Roger, who has lived 
under the viaduct six months. Turning to a visitor, he sneered. He said: "I 
have a $10 house next to a $210-million stadium. They don't want me next to 
them. You don't want me next to you." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Roger's neighbors, who had gathered in front of the neighborhood row 
of huts to chat and play bid whist, shouted their agreement. They talked 
passionately and proudly about how they help to guard the surrounding property, 
about how they live as day laborers and scrap collectors and how they shun 
official shelters because they are crowded and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Boasting about how the comrades look out for each other, one man challenged the 
visitor, saying: "I leave my hut with the door unlocked. I bet you can't leave 
your hut without locking your door." 
</P>
<P>
Local officials insist that it is too soon to worry about losing the huts. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has not expressed any plan of action on that," said Jerome Eppinger 
of the Atlanta Office of Human Services, who coordinates assistance to the 
homeless. "We let them know about other facilities. Beyond that, you have to 
let people make their own choice. This is their shelter of choice." 
</P>
<P>
Jody Plummer, a nurse with a community health program, was skeptical. "I 
wouldn't be surprised if they were moved," she said. "It would be really sad if 
the city takes them away and doesn't put anything in their place." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Connor, an architect who is a Mad Houser, believes the "moneywigs" will 
be driven to dismantle the huts "for appearances' sake." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Society is insensitive, or there wouldn't be such a problem with 
homelessness." An estimated 8,000 homeless people live in this city of 420,000. 
</P>
<P>
Under the viaduct, a resolute young man was certain that his hut would be 
destroyed, but he was philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
"When they move us," he said, "we just become more tenacious. We're like 
roaches. We survive."

NON-ENDANGERED SECRETARY: Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.'s recent 
criticism of the Endangered Species Act touched off an uproar among 
environmentalists, some of whom likened him to Ronald Reagan Administration 
Interior Secretary James G. Watt, the bete noire of the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the furor, few demands for Lujan's ouster have been heard. The main 
reason? Knowledgeable environmentalists regard the two Republicans considered 
to be Lujan's most likely replacement -- New Mexico Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers 
and Idaho Sen. James A. McClure -- as conservative ideologues who would be 
harder for them to stomach than Lujan. 
</P>
<P>
Carruthers, who is constitutionally barred from succeeding himself when his 
term is up at the end of this year, is considered a prospect for the Interior 
slot because he was Watt's right-hand man in the department as assistant 
secretary. As for McClure, who is retiring after three Senate terms, 
environmentalists respect him as a formidable adversary, most recently because 
of his crusade on behalf of a proposed nuclear weapons facility in his state. 
His 1988 rating from the League of Conservation Voters was zero. 
</P>
<P>
Next to these two, environmentalists say, Lujan seems environmentally sound. 
"Lujan doesn't always say what we want to hear, but he is capable of doing good 
things," says one veteran environmental lobbyist. "He is not an ideological 
hard-liner." 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON TREADMILL: Like many Washington officials, Senate Republican leader 
Bob Dole and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole, have 
struggled to work physical fitness into their crowded daily schedules. For the 
Doles, the answer is a treadmill, which they say burns off calories and keeps 
them in shape with a minimum of fuss. 
</P>
<P>
So enthusiastic is the senator that he's ready to extol the machine's virtues 
at the drop of a sweatband. Better yet, he'll send you a pamphlet describing 
the device.

One came recently with a note demonstrating that, whatever shape the rest of 
him is in, Dole's famous wit is still in tip-top form: 
</P>

"Here's the information I promised about the treadmill. It's still my preferred 
mode for exercise, and it's the perfect technique for Washington -- spending a 
lot of time going nowhere fast."

<P>
ONE-UPMANSHIP: On the eve of congressional debate on funding for the B-2 
Stealth bomber, the aircraft's foes are launching a publicity blitz to try to 
ground the Air Force's $65-billion flying-wing project. The campaign includes 
television spots, newspaper ads and an intense barrage of anti-aircraft 
hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
At a Union of Concerned Scientists press conference last week where an 
anti-Stealth bomber TV and newspaper advertising campaign was unveiled, the 
foes of the $850-million-a-copy plane engaged in some metaphoric one-upmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Ris, executive director of the union, warmed up the crowd with a 
description of the plane as "nothing more than a flying monument to Donald 
Trump." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) called it "a flying Ft. Knox." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John G. Rowland (R-Conn.) accused the Air Force of pursuing a "Noah's Ark 
theory" -- wanting to buy two of everything. 
</P>
<P>
The wrap-up went to Rep. Tom Ridge (R-Pa.), who accused the Air Force brass of 
insisting on buying obsolete manned bombers capable of penetrating Soviet air 
space because they want "a macho delivery platform" for their nuclear weapons.

BULGARIAN COMMUNISTS ARE EXPECTED TO WIN

<P>
Communists, with support from Bulgarians who favor a slower pace toward reform, 
are expected to clinch a strong parliamentary victory in runoff elections held 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
State television reported some voting irregularities, including illegal 
canvassing near polling stations. But the voting generally appeared to go 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
The 400-seat Parliament, the first freely elected legislature in Bulgaria in 58 
years, will have a substantial number of opposition lawmakers, and their 
presence will mark the end of rubber-stamp approval for policies of the former 
rulers. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists -- who now call themselves Socialists -- were the winners in the 
first round of voting on June 10, garnering 172 seats. They needed to win only 
29 of the 81 seats being decided in the runoffs to gain an absolute majority. 
</P>
<P>
Communist leader Alexander Lilov was a first-round winner, but Prime Minister 
Andrei Lukanov faced a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The main opposition alliance, the United Democratic Forces, won 107 seats in 
the first round, and other opposition groups won 40. The alliance and the 
Agrarian Party, a once docile ally of the Communists, have both vowed not to 
join a coalition with the new Communists. 
</P>
<P>
However, Communist and United Democratic Forces officials have said they might 
form a government of specialists chosen on the basis of their expertise rather 
than their political affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
Polls opened at 7 a.m. and closed at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Dimiter Popov, secretary of the Central Electoral Commission, said the 
commission expects to announce the results Tuesday, the state news agency BTA 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
State television said 75% of the eligible voters had cast ballots shortly 
before the polls closed. In the first first round, 91% voted. 
</P>
<P>
First-round results show that in 22 of the 81 constituencies where balloting 
was repeated Sunday, Communist candidates had a substantial lead over their 
rivals, and in 33 others they had a slight edge.

Voters dealt center-left President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos a political defeat in 
legislative elections Sunday, giving his rightist opposition potential control 
of Congress, according to early unofficial returns. 
</P>
<P>
The victory by opposition parties is likely to bring an end to the political 
calm that has marked this small Andean nation in the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative Social Christian Party of former President Leon Febres Cordero 
gained 11 seats and will control 18 seats in the 72-member unicameral Congress. 
The projections showed Borja's Democratic Left party losing half of its 30 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
The elections are seen as a referendum on the first two years of Borja's 
four-year term in office. His popularity has been undermined by his failure to 
keep a campaign promise to reduce inflation from more than 50% last year to 
25%.

DEATH TOLL REACHES 19, WITH 18 MISSING, AS CREWS DIG IN OHIO FLASH FLOOD 
DEBRIS;

ARE LOCATED.

<P>
The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern 
Ohio increased to 19 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into 
the Ohio River. Eighteen people remained missing. 
</P>
<P>
Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through 
debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they had 
detected human scents, National Guard Capt. Jim Boling said. 
</P>
<P>
Divers worked where the two creeks empty into the Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
One body was found Sunday in debris along Wegee Creek, about three miles from 
where it meets the river, said Belmont County coroner's investigator Chuck 
Vogt. Another was pulled from the Ohio near a bridge at Moundsville, W. Va., 
about 10 miles south of Shadyside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of a man was found Sunday afternoon in the Ohio River, a half-mile 
south of the mouth of Wegee Creek and about seven miles south of Shadyside, 
Vogt said. 
</P>
<P>
That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursday's floods to 19, including 
five children. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three dog teams from four states were searching for victims. The digging 
will continue at least through Tuesday, Fire Chief Mark Badia said. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing you find once you start into these brush piles and piles of trees 
are cars, and they have to be torn apart and searched separately," Badia said. 
"Everything you turn up creates a different situation." 
</P>
<P>
Vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be found alive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody alive out there," he 
said. "You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River." 
</P>
<P>
The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed Thursday night during storms that poured 5 
1/2 inches of rain onto eastern Ohio in 3 1/2 hours. The floods destroyed as 
many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40 others. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of those were later 
found dead, while others notified authorities that they were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also learned that some of those feared missing had moved out of the 
area. Officials were comparing county property lists and data from the Census 
Bureau with information from residents and relatives, Boling said. 
</P>
<P>
That left 18 still missing, Vogt said. The list was not revised to account for 
the third body found Sunday afternoon because the man had not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm 
that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of three bridges over the creeks. 
Badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks, 
forming dams at each bridge. The "dams" broke under the water pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more. The debris broke loose, and 
that's when we got three big gushes of water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As rescue efforts continued, the National Guard cleared roads and bridges 
leading into the stricken area. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen Ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas since 
tornadoes and flooding first struck May 25.

CARDINAL DENIES THREATENING POLITICIANS OVER ABORTION

Cardinal John J. O'Connor insisted Sunday that he never threatened to 
excommunicate Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. He said his 
views on the contentious issue have been widely misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, speaking at St. Patrick's Cathedral, said that many politicians and 
members of the news media had misunderstood a long column about abortion that 
he wrote for last week's Catholic New York, the official archdiocese newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"I never threatened to excommunicate anybody," said O'Connor, who heads the 
U.S. Catholic bishops' pro-life committee and has been an outspoken opponent of 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish everybody would read what I wrote," he said. "I never suggested that 
any other bishop should excommunicate anybody. I have no intention of 
excommunicating anybody. I don't say, in any way whatsoever, that I'm 
threatening politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing in the world I want to see is anyone excommunicated," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Many such officials, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, personally oppose abortion 
but do not seek to impose their beliefs on others. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor wrote: "Where Catholics are perceived not only as treating church 
teaching on abortion with contempt, but helping to multiply abortions by 
advocating legislation supporting abortion, or by making public funds available 
for abortion, bishops may decide that, for the common good, such Catholics must 
be warned that they are at risk of excommunication."

MAYORS CALLING FOR REPEAL OF DEFICIT-REDUCTION LAW; 
</P>
<P>
CITIES: THE LEADERS SAY URBAN PROGRAMS WOULD BE THE FIRST TO BE HIT BY 
GRAMM-RUDMAN CUTS. THEY ALSO SEEK A LOWER SOCIAL SECURITY TAX.

<P>
America's mayors Sunday gave initial approval to a broad and costly domestic 
agenda that asks Congress to repeal the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law and 
to cut Social Security taxes for nearly 120 million workers. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 70 resolutions approved by the U.S. Conference of Mayors' key 
policy committee contain repeated pleas for a multibillion-dollar infusion of 
federal funds for anti-drug, housing, education and anti-poverty programs. 
</P>
<P>
The resolutions endorsed Sunday will go before the full conference of more than 
200 mayors Wednesday. But the panel's decisions are rarely changed 
significantly in those votes, which set the lobbying agenda for the 
organization's Washington staff. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors, who have spent much of the first three days of their six-day annual 
meeting criticizing the federal government for slashing aid to cities, said 
repealing Gramm-Rudman would force lawmakers to confront the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many of our members of Congress are using this as a crutch to hide some of 
the true problems of our economy," said Mayor Paul Soglin of Madison, Wis. "A 
series of budget gimmicks have been implemented." 
</P>
<P>
Under Gramm-Rudman, automatic spending cuts take effect if Congress and the 
White House do not meet specified deficit-reduction targets. The mayors 
complained that city-level services would be the first to feel the automatic 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Conference staff said the mayors group -- if the full conference endorses the 
proposal as expected -- would be the first organization of elected officials to 
call for repeal of Gramm-Rudman. 
</P>
<P>
In calling for the Social Security payroll tax to be cut from 7.65% to 6.71%, 
the mayors panel also called on Congress to remove the cap on outside earnings 
of Social Security recipients and stop using the balance in the Social Security 
trust fund to mask the true size of the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in one tax-related resolution approved Sunday was a statement 
opposing a capital gains tax cut favored by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this year's meeting, big-city mayors have been urging their 
colleagues to be more militant in their lobbying of Washington and to lay claim 
to a good chunk of expected defense savings by warning that urban tensions are 
reaching a boiling point because of cash-poor anti-poverty programs. 
</P>
<P>
Scuttled Sunday was a bid by some mayors to call for a constitutional amendment 
that cities receive a "fair and fixed" percentage of federal revenues if 
Congress refuses to pass a law mandating the revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
That idea had sparked a split Saturday between conference committees on human 
development and urban economic policy, with the latter group prevailing in 
getting the amendment language deleted.

After most of 52 years, Herb Caen announced that this weekend's effort was his

"I never did get a handle on the Sunday column," he wrote with a touch of

</P>
<P>
"Talking about how great old San Francisco was exposed me as the crank and 
grump I was becoming . . . the Baghdad-by-the-Bay stuff . . . wore thin as the 
city changed," he said, concluding: "So, farewell, faithful Sunday readers . . 
. there's a plan afoot to run old Caen columns in this space, and I'll read 
them with great interest, wondering how I got away with it."

VEGAS OPENS A NEW CASTLE OF EXCESS; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE EXCALIBUR, A SUPER-CASINO BUILT BY CIRCUS CIRCUS 
ENTERPRISES, MAY WIDEN THE GAP BETWEEN GAMBLING'S HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even by the standards of Las Vegas, where gaudy is great and hyperbole abounds, 
the Excalibur casino hotel stands out. 
</P>
<P>
Set to open Tuesday morning at the outer edge of the storied Las Vegas Strip, 
the Excalibur has more than 4,000 rooms, the most of any hotel in the world, 
and a casino with a castle motif that combines traditional Nevada gambling with 
a touch of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
At a cost of nearly $300 million, the Excalibur promises to take Las Vegas to 
new levels of adult fantasy and eclipse, at least temporarily, the attention on 
the Mirage, another mega-casino hotel that opened in November with a flourish. 
</P>
<P>
The Excalibur, however, also seems certain to deepen the gulf between the 
casino haves and have-nots. Many smaller, less glamorous casinos in Las Vegas 
either break even or lose money, while the industry as a whole is reporting 
record gambling winnings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Excalibur and the Mirage will be successful, but it will be at the 
expense of the other casinos," said Jim Kilby, professor of gaming at the 
University of Nevada at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Excalibur is another example of the new genre of behemoth casino hotels 
that are more entertainment emporiums and tourist attractions than traditional 
gambling parlors. (Developer Donald J. Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, 
N.J., which opened in April, also belongs in this category.) 
</P>
<P>
"With the Mirage, it's a new era in the gambling business," said William S. 
Fellows, casino industry analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
"The Excalibur is as much an entertainment center as it is a place to gamble." 
</P>
<P>
The Excalibur is a major reason behind the furious hotel expansion that has 
gripped Las Vegas in recent months and made it one of the fastest-growing 
cities in America. It will probably have 75,000 hotel rooms at the end of 1990, 
an expansion of nearly 20% in two years. The mushrooming has raised fears of a 
glut of rooms if the economy falters. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have an infinite number of gamblers," casino industry consultant 
Walter Tyminski noted. 
</P>
<P>
The Excalibur has greatly elevated the profile of its corporate owner, Circus 
Circus Enterprises, which owns casinos throughout Nevada, including its 
flagship on the crowded north end of the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The company's casinos, built largely around circus or riverboat themes, are 
frequented by a budget-conscious RV crowd drawn by low hotel rates and cheap 
meals. The company says it makes its money on the low-stakes gambling tables 
and slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
"They make their money off people who spend $100 to $200 a day," said Lee 
Isgur, gaming analyst for Paine Webber in New York. "Their customers are Mr. 
and Mrs. Middle America who think it's fun to go to a casino." 
</P>
<P>
Excalibur is named after the sword of King Arthur, the medieval monarch who, 
according to one legend, proved he was the rightful heir to the English throne 
by being able to pull the weapon out of a block of stone. 
</P>
<P>
According to another version, Arthur received the sword from a mysterious lady 
who lived in a castle on a lake. Shortly before his death, Arthur had the sword 
thrown into the lake and it was never seen again. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the legend, Excalibur is exploiting medieval nostalgia for all it's 
worth in a pre-opening advertising and promotion blitz expected to cost $2.5 
million. "The hotel . . . will transport guests back in time to the days of 
knights, fair maidens, jousting and feasting," promised a news release. 
</P>
<P>
The castle-like casino building, surrounded by four 28-story hotel towers, has 
everything from a "Canterbury" wedding chapel on the top floor to a dinner 
theater in the round on the bottom, where knights will joust on horseback. In 
between will be restaurants, arcades and strolling entertainers dressed in 
medieval garb. 
</P>
<P>
Circus Circus Enterprises is largely the creation of a publicity-shy gambling 
mogul named William G. Bennett, whose distaste for frills has earned his 
company a reputation as the K mart of the casino industry. 
</P>
<P>
The company typically has made its money by keeping volume up and costs down. 
"It's the time-honored K mart concept," said competitor Stephen A. Wynn, chief 
executive of Golden Nugget, which owns the Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Though it cost $290 million, the Excalibur has apparently not abandoned the K 
mart approach. Rates on the no-frills rooms will be inexpensive by Strip 
standards, as low as $45 a night. 
</P>
<P>
A one-time retailer, Bennett took over Circus Circus in 1974. He has since 
molded the firm into a gambling concern that's as popular on Wall Street as on 
Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Circus Circus Enterprises earned $75.1 million in the year ended Jan. 31 on 
revenue of $522 million. It has had a compounded annual earnings growth rate of 
nearly 20% the past five years. Its stock jumped almost 20% in one recent 
three-week period, though it has since cooled some. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's stewardship of Circus Circus Enterprises has catapulted him into the 
ranks of America's super-rich. Forbes magazine estimated his personal fortune 
at $445 million last fall -- before the latest run-up in the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's ownership in Circus Circus stock alone is worth an estimated $300 
million, based on Friday's closing price of $61.25 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. According to the firm's latest proxy statement, Bennett is the 
largest shareholder, with nearly 5 million shares, or 18%. 
</P>
<P>
Now 65 and with no plans to retire, Bennett is a former World War II bomber 
pilot who until the mid-1960s ran a chain of furniture stores in Phoenix, his 
hometown. In 1965, he joined Del Webb Corp., then a major player in the 
gambling industry. Eventually he became manager of their casinos in Las Vegas 
and Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him in the late 1960s when he was managing the Mint (casino) and I 
was a liquor salesman in town," Wynn recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett later operated a business that leased slot machines to casinos. He 
teamed with partner William N. Pennington in 1974 to buy Circus Circus 
Enterprises. The Bennett-Pennington partnership lasted until 1988, when 
Pennington retired as company president. Pennington, 67, remains a director and 
the second-largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett and other Circus Circus executives are billing the Excalibur as a 
sure-fire winner destined to become a premier tourist attraction. Its location 
on the far south end of the Strip should loom large on the Las Vegas skyline 
for travelers driving in from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope it will become our No. 1 profit maker," Bennett said in a recent 
interview. "It should have a major impact." 
</P>
<P>
If Bennett's latest endeavor ultimately flops, it will come as a shock to 
people outside the firm as well. Investment analysts, consultants and 
competitors alike believe that the Excalibur, with its singular theme and 
ambience, will be a hit from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Investors have been particularly impressed with the success of the Mirage, 
which defied the skeptics and turned a profit from the outset. Equal parts 
casino and entertainment complex, the Mirage has as its primary attraction a 
man-made volcano in its front yard. 
</P>
<P>
After two years of losses, Golden Nugget made $17.3 million in the first three 
months of 1990. According to Wynn, the Mirage is generating about $600,000 a 
day in operating profits. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Cosgrove, investment analyst for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los 
Angeles, said the success of the Mirage "leaves little doubt about turn-away 
crowds for Excalibur. A summer opening, a family-oriented resort and a buoyant 
economy bode well." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the Excalibur will end the exile of the Tropicana, which 
opened in 1957 and was virtually by itself at the south end of the Strip. 
Officials with the Tropicana's present owner, Aztar Corp., think that the 
Excalibur will bring them significant walk-in gambling business for the first 
time since they bought the hotel in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it that we will have the world's largest hotel across the street after 
10 years (alone)," said Paul E. Rubeli, Aztar's chief executive.

JAPAN AND MEXICO BUILDING STRONGER ECONOMIC BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of this huge city are holding their breath -- almost literally -- 
awaiting the outcome of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's three-day 
visit to Japan, which began Sunday. During the visit, Salinas is expected to 
sign a final agreement under which Japan's Export-Import Bank will lend Mexico 
$1 billion to finance the purchase of anti-pollution equipment. The funds will 
be used, in part, for refining equipment that will reduce the sulfur content of 
gasoline and other fuels. Automobiles account for three-fourths of the air 
pollution in this city of about 18 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The loan symbolizes the growing cooperation between Mexico and Japan, a 
relationship that trade experts and diplomats say will only be enhanced by a 
U.S.-Mexico trade agreement. Presidents Bush and Salinas agreed June 10 to 
begin preliminary work on a broad free-trade agreement between their two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Japan-Mexico economic relations, already on the move, have picked up steam 
since Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's visit to Mexico last year. Investments now 
being considered would double the $1.4 billion Japan has already invested in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese auto maker Nissan has begun work on a five-year, $1-billion expansion 
of its Queretaro plant. Industrial giant Mitsui is considering an agreement 
with Petroleos Mexicanos -- Mexico's state-owned oil monopoly -- to build a 
$345-million petrochemical plant. And Japan's Aoki hotel firm is completing 
plans for a hotel in Cancun and is considering sites in Puerto Vallarta and La 
Paz. That does not count the dozen expansion projects under way at the 50 
Japanese-owned maquiladoras, factories concentrated near the U.S.-Mexico border 
that assemble foreign-made components for export to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
More investments and agreements will probably be announced during Salinas' 
visit, predicted Carlos Lalanne, spokesman for the Mexico office of JETRO, the 
Japanese External Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Besides returning Kaifu's visit, Salinas will meet with members of Keidanren, 
the leading Japanese association of private businesses. He has said the main 
purpose of his trip is to attract more Japanese capital to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has already surpassed Brazil to become the major Latin American 
recipient of Japanese investment. Japan ranks fourth among foreign investors in 
Mexico, after the United States, Britain and West Germany. Still, Japanese 
investment represents just 5% of foreign capital in Mexico, compared to the 
United States' two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese interest in Mexico was spurred first by oil -- which still accounts 
for a major part of Mexico's $1.7 billion in exports to Japan -- and more 
recently by privatization of Mexican government- owned enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The government's decision last year to end its monopoly on 42 petrochemical 
products has industrial conglomerates Mitsubishi and Sumitomo considering 
investments in that industry. And, according to Lalanne, Nippon Electric Co. 
may be interested in participating in the investor group that buys Telefonos de 
Mexico, the telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipation of a U.S.-Mexico free-trade agreement could provide an additional 
incentive for Japanese and other Asian corporations to increase the pace of 
investment here, said Ryukichi Imai, Japan's ambassador to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of Japanese investors in Mexico are targeting the U.S. market," 
Hajime Hatano, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry's 
director for Latin America and Oceana, told the Mexican magazine Proceso. 
</P>
<P>
A free-trade agreement would assure access to the U.S. market for goods 
produced by Japanese corporations investing in Mexico, thus making such 
investments more attractive. An agreement -- combined with the geographical 
fact of Mexico's long border with the United States -- would make Mexico a 
magnet for Japanese investors, Hatano said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico realizes, as a Mexican Senate commission found not long ago, that its 
proximity to the United States is its major strategic advantage as a Pacific 
Rim trading nation. That awareness demonstrates a major change from Mexico's 
hope during the 1980s that it could use Japan as a bargaining chip in 
negotiations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have indicated that they will not go for that, so Mexico's goal 
now is to play a key role in a trade triangle in which its partners are the 
major economic powers of the Pacific Rim.

Cineplex Odeon to Sell More Theaters: The movie theater chain said it is 
selling 24 movie theaters in the Carolinas and Tennessee to Carmike Cinemas 
Inc. of Columbus, Ga., for $11 million. Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon announced 
last week that it was selling 38 theaters in five Midwest and Western states to 
Plitt Amusement Co. Inc. of Los Angeles for $31.7 million. Cineplex, which has 
been under financial pressure, will use proceeds from the sales to pay down its 
long-term debt.

Denver Woos Mexicana Airlines: Denver has joined several other cities in the 
quest to wrest Mexicana Airlines' North American headquarters from Los Angeles, 
which newly privatized Mexicana says is too costly. 
</P>
<P>
Denver Mayor Federico Pena and Colorado Gov. Roy Romer have sent letters to 
Mexicana, saying Denver has low-cost office space. The headquarters will create 
210 jobs wherever it relocates. Other cities reportedly in the running for the 
facility include Dallas, San Antonio and Tampa.

CBS RECORDS PLANS AFFIRMATIVE STEPS FOR BLACKS; 
</P>
<P>
MINORITIES: THE PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITY IS AN INDUSTRY FIRST. BUT 
THE NAACP SAYS IT LACKS SPECIFICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than three years after the NAACP raised allegations of widespread racial 
discrimination in the music industry, CBS Records has become the first record 
company to give the civil rights group a written affirmative action proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The record business has lagged behind other industries in signing "fair share" 
economic agreements with the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People that would commit them to be more responsive to black workers and 
consumers. The NAACP has signed pacts with 49 firms since 1982 but has no 
agreements with the $6.5-billion record industry. 
</P>
<P>
Still, an official of the NAACP, which is scheduled to hold its national 
convention in Los Angeles next month, expressed dissatisfaction with the 
three-page proposal signed by CBS Records President Walter F. Yetnikoff. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be more of a testimonial in terms of what they've done than in 
terms of what they are going to do," said Fred Rasheed, the NAACP's director of 
economic development. "Based on my discussions, I don't think we are going to 
sign it." 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP's fair share agreements typically run 10 pages or more and cover 
everything from corporate philanthropy and purchases from black suppliers to 
black employment and setting up a monitoring mechanism, Rasheed said. 
</P>
<P>
Yetnikoff could not be reached for comment. But LeBaron Taylor, CBS vice 
president of corporate affairs and the company executive closest to the NAACP 
discussions, said: "What we have presented is a credible document. From our 
perspective we have satisfied the request of the NAACP." 
</P>
<P>
Only four months ago, the NAACP said it was considering boycotting CBS Records, 
a unit of Sony Corp., after years of fruitless talks persuaded it that the 
record industry was dragging its feet and not providing sufficient 
opportunities for blacks. But the two groups resumed talks in recent weeks in 
hopes of reaching an accord in time for the NAACP's national convention July 
8-12. 
</P>
<P>
Some record companies say they agree with the NAACP's goals, but most have 
either asked for more time to consider fair share pacts or argue that their 
existing affirmative action programs make the agreements unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Black record executives are divided over whether the industry has shown 
progress since 1987, when the NAACP released a 20-page report alleging that 
racial discrimination was "rampant" in the business. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there has been progress -- and meaningful progress," said Tom Draper, 
vice president of community relations for Time Warner Inc. and former vice 
president of black music at Warner Bros. Records. 
</P>
<P>
But Brenda Andrews, a vice president at Almo Irving Music Publishing, said: "I 
think there's a lot more to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said there has been no update on the NAACP's 1987 report, but he 
speculated that since then, there has been little change. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks are still pretty much excluded from the industry," Rasheed said. "There 
are only one or two blacks that have any real decision-making power and 
authority." 
</P>
<P>
Yet recently there has been speculation that one of the industry's 
highest-ranking black executives -- Ed Eckstine, executive vice president, 
talent and creative affairs at Polygram Records -- might become the first black 
to head a major record company other than Motown Records. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Eckstine has gained control over the marketing, publicity and 
video product areas at Polygram, in addition to his previous duties finding and 
signing artists, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
But spokeswoman Dawn Bridges said Alain Levy, executive vice president of 
Polygram, is "playing his cards close to the vest" and is "keeping his options 
open" regarding who will become head of Polygram's U.S. operations. Levy is 
leaving his current post to become, effective Jan. 1, the president and chief 
executive of Polygram N.V., the Netherlands-based parent company.

'English Only' Policy: The federal government sued Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. 
claiming that the retailer's "English only" policy discriminates against 
Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed in U.S. District Court suit in Los Angeles said Sears requires 
employees at its Los Angeles Payroll Center to speak only English and since 
1988 has threatened to suspend workers opposed to the policy. The suit, filed 
on behalf of Leonor Hernandez and other Spanish-speakers, asked for a court 
order barring Sears from the practice and requiring it to pay "relief" to those 
affected by the policy. (Filed June 13, 1990. Case No. 90-3037)

AVON WILL GO CALLING ON CHINA DESPITE POLITICAL CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
JOINT VENTURES: THE COSMETICS MAKER MAY BE THE FIRST MAJOR U.S. FIRM TO LAUNCH 
AN OPERATION THERE SINCE THE TIAN AN MEN SQUARE CRACKDOWN. 
</P>

<P>
Avon Products, the New York-based cosmetics firm plagued by poor earnings and 
takeover threats the past two years, is venturing where few American companies 
have gone recently: China. 
</P>
<P>
Avon has formed a joint venture with the Guangzhou Cosmetics Factory in the 
southern city of Canton to manufacture and sell cosmetics. Avon executives 
already have begun to select equipment for the plant and to develop training 
materials for sales representatives and supervisors. The venture expects to 
launch sales operations by October. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of international investment in China has slowed since the June, 1989, 
massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators at Tian An Men Square in Beijing. Asian 
trade consultants said the Avon deal may be the first major China venture by a 
U.S. firm since the showdown. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of China's aging Communist leadership have urged U.S. businesses 
to forgo investment until Beijing shows signs of improving the human rights 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, U.S. companies concede -- wherever one invests -- that you have to 
take the human rights into consideration," said Timothy Smith, executive 
director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based 
coalition of church-related shareholder groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Has the human rights situation (in China) improved?" he asked. "Is Avon 
following the human rights situation in China?" 
</P>
<P>
But Smith conceded: "There has not been a groundswell of institutional 
investors asking companies to stay out of China." 
</P>
<P>
Avon President James Preston said he considered the views of those opposing new 
American investment in China before deciding to approve the venture. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided that this was a commercial endeavor -- not a political endeavor," he 
said. "The venture will not benefit the government of China; it will benefit 
the women of China and Avon's shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Preston said Avon won't make a profit the first three years, partly because of 
start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President John Novosad, who manages Avon's Pacific operations from Hong 
Kong, said, however, that Avon considered breaking off its talks with the 
Chinese after the crackdown. "I saw the television reports of the violence, and 
my reaction was shock and disbelief." 
</P>
<P>
Novosad said he decided, however, that "the best way to ensure peace around the 
world is through economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
"When people have an opportunity for economic growth, they're less likely to 
throw stones at each other," he said. "I believe that strong economic growth 
and economic opportunities will be very beneficial to the Chinese people." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, signed last January, Avon owns 60% of the joint venture. 
It is making an initial investment of $1 million and plans to increase its 
equity stake as more financing is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement allows for product distribution throughout China, the 
company plans to roll out its sales operation gradually. To start with, it will 
knock on the doors of about 10 million people in the Canton area. It will take 
its sales to other parts of the country later. 
</P>
<P>
Avon will provide the venture with equipment, cosmetics formulas, technical 
expertise and sales and marketing programs. It is licensing technology and 
trademarks to the joint venture firm. 
</P>
<P>
Avon plans to earn convertible foreign currency by exporting cosmetics. 
Initially, the venture will manufacture 80 to 90 skin-care and fragrance 
products. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing facility will begin with about 50 workers, the company said. 
It will train 20 supervisors this summer and hopes to hire 2,000 sales 
representatives between October and March. The sales representatives would work 
on a commission basis. 
</P>
<P>
The venture will pay off if it's handled as well as Avon's other foreign 
operations, said Andrew Shore, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. Avon 
has large operations in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Avon's sales abroad -- the company operates throughout Europe, Latin American 
and parts of Asia -- surpassed domestic sales in 1989. Foreign sales accounted 
for about $1.7 billion and U.S. operations about $1.6 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more sales growth potential on the international side," Shore said. 
"China could become a huge market." 
</P>
<P>
To be successful, however, Avon must develop a savvy marketing plan. 
</P>
<P>
The company uses the slogan "Look how good you look now" in the United States. 
It may use the Japanese Avon slogan, "Right for your skin," in China, company 
executives said. 
</P>
<P>
Avon executives said that Chinese women, once encouraged to eschew makeup and 
Western wear in favor of boxy Mao suits, have been demanding colorful fashions 
and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
The key to whether Avon is successful in China will be its sales force, 
executives say. They say Avon will be the first company to engage in the direct 
sale of mass-produced goods in China. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the start-up effort is a Hong Kong Chinese born in 
Canton. The 12-year Avon veteran has managed the company's Taiwan purchasing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Avon's entry into China does not portend a near-term investment pattern because 
China is still too unstable for many potential investors, said Mike Van Horn, a 
San Francisco trade consultant who specializes in Asian investment. The author 
of "Pacific Rim Trade," a guide book on Asian trade, said he has seen a number 
of American firms pull out of potential deals in China since the Tian An Men 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
"American firms are frightened because they sense the uncertainty in China," he 
said. "Avon's venture is risky because you don't know what's going to happen in 
China; but it's a prudent risk because Avon has so much experience in Asia."

WE'RE NO. 1: Orange County is "the Mecca of mail fraud," says postal inspector 
Kacy McClelland (D6). "When you've got your scheme perfected, here's the place 
you put it in motion." . . . Most crooks either rent space in Newport Beach or 
get a mail drop so they can assume a Newport address. . . . "They are selling a 
dream, the California promise: 'You can be rich quick and live here like we do 
in Newport -- the good life,' " he says. James S. Granelli and Tom McQueeney

THE BATTLE FOR HAPPY TRAILS; 
</P>
<P>
IN NORCO, HORSES OUTNUMBER HUMANS, AND OWNERS STAND UP TO BE COUNTED

NORCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this rural enclave on the edge of Riverside County, it's not so much whether 
you are pro-growth or anti-growth, liberal or conservative. Instead, what many 
say it comes down to is being pro-horse or anti-horse. 
</P>
<P>
But that's no surprise in Norco, a city of 25,000 where horses outnumber humans 
two to one. It is also where one of the most vocal lobbies is the Norco 
Horsemen's Assn., a group of 350 owners of horses and farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
For them, living in Norco isn't just equestrian shows, parades and getting 
saddle sores. Rather, it is a battle to make sure that Norco remains a land of 
happy trails. Their mission: Make sure that Norco stays rural and keep 
developers from going overboard in rustling up the land. 
</P>
<P>
"From past history, in other towns, the horse people have been moved out by 
developers," said Terry Wright, Norco Horsemen's Assn. founder. " . . . If you 
don't fight to keep your rights, you're going to lose them." 
</P>
<P>
Central to their drive is the upkeep of Norco's horse trails, 80 miles of sandy 
paths that line almost all city streets. Earlier this month, the Horsemen's 
Assn. argued for -- and got -- guarantees from the city to target more money to 
improve horse trails. And the group has listed the city's "Ten Worst Trails," 
where paths have been eroded or are dotted with litter. 
</P>
<P>
The Horsemen's Assn. also keeps a watchful eye on city activity, urging new 
businesses to adopt Old West-style facades (even a proposed new Department of 
Motor Vehicles facility will look western), speeding up the process to get 
horse crossings installed at major intersections and arguing for signs to let 
out-of-towners know that in Norco, there are lots of horses and lots of horse 
people. 
</P>
<P>
When rumors spread recently that a builder was thinking about developing 
Ingalls Park, Norco's equestrian center, it brought an irate protest from horsy 
folk all over town, including groups such as the Saddlesore Riders and the 
Norco Mounted Posse. For its part, the Horsemen's Assn. collected 3,000 
signatures against the development, even though no project had been formally 
proposed to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did was not take a chance," said Vic Jensen, Horsemen's Assn. 
president. "We're not giving up one damn more inch of Norco." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, these horse people jealously guard their rights to ride the range. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen told a story about how he attended a Norco Planning Commission meeting 
and discovered a housing development that included plans for "future" horse 
trails, rather than the preferred procedure of dedicating new trails as each 
house was built. 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'Future? No way!' " Jensen said during a recent meeting of the 
Horsemen's Assn. Board of Directors. "If they ain't dedicated, they ain't 
getting it." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes things will slip through," Jensen said later. "We won't let anything 
slip by us." 
</P>
<P>
But vocal horse groups have been a fixture through the years in Norco, which 
bears a horse as its emblem. Many restaurants and retail stores have hitching 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
"The way to fill the council chambers is to talk about doing away with trails 
or licensing horses," said Councilman Steve Nathan. "You'll get a big turnout." 
</P>
<P>
According to some residents who were around in the early 1970s, when one 
councilman got on the bad side of some horse owners, about a dozen of them 
rounded him up from the council chambers, put a noose around his neck and 
threatened to hang him on a tree across the street. As the story goes, they set 
him free after he got good and scared. 
</P>
<P>
Today, horse owners aren't quite as posse-driven. But getting the horse vote 
remains an important priority for local politicos. In City Council elections 
earlier this month, candidates quickly lined up to proclaim themselves as 
animal-keepers. Some say that sort of Norconian patriotism remains an 
out-and-out necessity to get elected. 
</P>
<P>
But candidates had to be careful. According to Wright, one prospective council 
member recommended at a Horsemen's Assn. candidate's forum at the local Sizzler 
restaurant that horse owners carry manure-scoopers to clean up after the 
horses. She was greeted by thunderous boos. 
</P>
<P>
Even the rumor of being labeled as anti-horse can be a red herring. Bill 
Vaughan, who was narrowly elected to the council, said he would probably have 
gotten more votes had not someone spread a false rumor that he wants to do away 
with animal-keeping rights. 
</P>
<P>
"That garbage they put on me, it appears to have turned (voters) off," he said. 
"It hurt me. I should have done better." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . You just don't win a council seat by being against animal-keeping 
rights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And one suggestion was made during the campaign that horses be licensed. 
</P>
<P>
"You have got to be kidding!" board member John Casper yelped when the idea was 
suggested at a recent Horsemen's Assn. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the fears held by horse owners come from past experience. Horsemen's 
Assn. members speak of being "run out of town" in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties because changes in zoning codes prevented them from keeping horses. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, greed is the biggest threat to our lifestyle," said Judy 
Malich, a member of the association. "They do it slowly. They'll do it in bits 
and pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping a close eye is necessary, members say, even if it appears the city and 
the Horsemen's Assn. are in sync in their protection of the rural lifestyle. 
But not everyone who moves into Norco has horses or animals. And some, albeit a 
small minority, are naysayers when it comes to horses. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want the smell, the droppings, the animals," said Barbara 
Carmichael, the president of the local 4-H club and a board member of the 
Horsemen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Carmichael boasts of owning a wide array of animals, including llamas, sheep 
and donkeys. She once seriously considered taking in a baby elephant. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie and Berwyn Hanna, other Horsemen's Assn. members who moved from Anaheim 
a few years ago, figure that unless they keep a close eye on city activity they 
stand to be zoned out of their ranch, which is inhabited by two horses, two 
donkeys and a mule. They also built a western-facade shed, making their back 
yard look like a mini-Calico Ghost Town. Their fences bear an assortment of 
offbeat signs, including one that reads: 'Please don't feed fingers to the 
mules.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a horseshoer and I don't want to move out even further," said Berwyn 
Hanna, who grew up in the Texas panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't stand for this," said Bobbie Hanna, "we're going to become Orange 
County."

Undercover sheriff's deputies posing first as narcotics buyers and then as 
street dealers arrested a cocaine seller and 10 customers in the Scottsdale 
Estates area of Carson, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The area around Scottsdale South Street, from Boot Hill Lane to Cactus Lane, 
was targeted by narcotic deputies from the Carson, Lakewood, Lomita, Lynwood 
and Firestone stations. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a (drug) buy and then they busted the guy they made the buy from, 
then conducted a sting operation" where the deputies posed and street dealers, 
Deputy Rafael Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 arrested included nine men and two male juveniles. They were booked on 
allegations ranging from possession of cocaine to sales of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies also seized a small amount of rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The men were booked at the Carson sheriff's station with bail ranging from 
$2,500 to $20,000. One of the men was also booked for assault on a peace 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The two juveniles were held at the Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, deputies from four stations conducted a similar operation at 
26 locations in Lynwood, Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrested 16 people during the Lynwood operation, including 10 men, 
five male juveniles and one female juvenile, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The action was prompted by citizen complaints and follow-up investigation by 
Lynwood narcotics investigators that led to the targeting of these locations," 
Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 men were booked at the Lynwood sheriff's station and held on bail 
ranging from $2,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
One male juvenile was booked at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall. The five other 
juveniles were released to the custody of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were booked for possession of rock cocaine, sales of marijuana 
and possession of cocaine for sale, he said.

MURAL PROMOTING DICE CLAY MOVIE DEFACED BY PROTESTERS

A huge building mural promoting a new film starring raunchy comedian Andrew 
Dice Clay was splattered with paint Sunday by a protest group that also 
unfurled a banner criticizing the studio chief behind the film. 
</P>
<P>
The mural promoting "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane" adorns the side of a 
multistory storage building in the 3000 block of Grand Avenue along the Harbor 
Freeway. Two callers who claimed to belong to a group calling itself Activists 
Against Sexist Pigs said it was attacked about 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The mural was splattered with paint, and a red banner about 15 feet long was 
hung from the top of the building. The callers said the banner was intended to 
criticize Barry Diller, head of 20th Century Fox studios, which produced Dice 
Clay's film. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a responsibility factor with Andrew Dice Clay," a male caller said. 
"He claims to be a nice guy, but turns around and slams gays, slams women, 
slams people of color. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that the people who are supporting him -- and there are numerous gay 
men supporting him -- they have to be responsible to their communities, not 
just the gays, but women and people of color," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both callers denied that they are promoting censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with censorship," a woman caller said. "Andrew Dice Clay 
has the right to say whatever he wants. But when he engages in (hatred of 
women), he has to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the third attack in recent weeks on advertisements for the 
film featuring Dice Clay, a Brooklyn comic reviled by some for his jokes about 
women, homosexuals, immigrants and others. 
</P>
<P>
The callers said the assault on the mural was carried out by a "diverse group 
of people, men and women, gay and straight." 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, a poster for "Ford Fairlane" outside 20th Century Fox studios was 
splattered with paint by the same protest group. A Dice Clay billboard in 
Hollywood was the first target of Activists Against Sexist Pigs several weeks 
ago.

JAIL INMATE ESCAPES FROM LOCAL HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County Jail inmate was being sought Sunday after she escaped from a 
local hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
JoAnne Gonzalez, 24, escaped at 10:05 p.m. Saturday from Western Medical Center 
in Santa Ana, where she had been taken for examination, Sheriff's Lt. Harold 
Schaffroth said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez had been in custody since early Friday morning on warrants for 
prostitution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffroth, who did not know which law enforcement department had placed 
Gonzalez under arrest, said the woman had been an inmate at the jail when she 
was taken to the hospital for examination. The reason for her visit to the 
hospital was confidential, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, at the hospital, "when the deputy's attention was distracted, she 
slipped her handcuffs and got away," Schaffroth said. "Investigators have been 
assigned to locate Ms. Gonzalez, and she is not considered dangerous to 
others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, who was last seen wearing an Orange County Jail-issue blue jumpsuit, 
was described as being about 5 feet, 2 inches tall, weighing 140 pounds and 
having black hair and brown eyes.

PLANNERS ENDORSE DOWNTOWN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An office and retail project called a "focal point of the downtown area" 
cleared its first hurdle last week, winning the approval of the Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the planners unanimously endorsed a site plan and tentative tract 
map requested by IDM Corp. of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to construct 116,775 square feet of office and retail space 
at the northwest corner of Garden Grove Boulevard and Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
The 8.5-acre site now is largely vacant, and final approval of the project 
still must come from the city's Agency for Community Development and the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
As approved by the commission, the project would be built in two phases. The 
first phase would consist of a five-story office tower and the surrounding 
parking area. That portion would have to be completed before construction is 
begun on the second phase -- three one-story garden office buildings along 
Acacia Parkway on the north and a one-story retail building along Garden Grove 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
IDM's mid-rise office tower would be at the southeast corner of the project, 
across the street from another five-story IDM office building constructed at 
the northeast corner of the intersection in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The project is intended to be compatible with the historic Main Street district 
to the west, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It is the latest of several development proposals for the site. Previous plans 
have all been withdrawn, and the land has stood unused for more than a decade.

HISTORICAL GROUP HONORS NEUGEBAUER 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer spent her 62nd birthday last November 
watching crews move a 74-year-old red barn from its old location to the city's 
new historical park three miles away. 
</P>
<P>
It was the middle of the night, but Neugebauer said she wasn't about to miss an 
event she had worked so hard to see take place. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of her efforts, Neugebauer has been selected to receive an Award of 
Merit from the Conference of California Historical Societies at a ceremony in 
San Luis Obispo on June 22. The veteran councilwoman was nominated for the 
award by members of the Westminster Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being honored for saving the barn, which had stood on the corner 
of Bolsa Avenue and Bushard Street since 1915, Neugebauer will also be honored 
for her efforts in relocating and restoring the Midway City Women's Club 
building last year. Both buildings are slated to be permanent fixtures at the 
Leaora Blakey Historical Park at 8612 Westminster Blvd. The park eventually 
will house a city museum. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to be recognized and even more pleased to be nominated by members 
of our local chapter," said Neugebauer, who is a candidate for Orange County 
supervisor. "This was a team effort all the way." GREG HERNANDEZ

GROUP TRIES TO HELP LEUKEMIA VICTIM, 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four-year-old Dennyelle Von Bargen needs a bone marrow transplant to fight off 
leukemia, but with no medical insurance, her mother could not imagine how she 
would pay a hospital bill that doctors estimate could run to $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Four local businessmen who learned of Dennyelle's plight, however, are hoping 
to make a difference with a carnival planned for Saturday in Fountain Valley's 
Mile Square Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal and our plan is to do something like this every six months," said Dan 
Gibbons, one of the event's sponsors and a Huntington Beach businessman. Local 
vendors have donated food, drinks and prizes to be given away at the carnival, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
The carnival, which will feature about 20 games and booths from noon to 4 p.m., 
will be the first fund-raiser by a fledgling foundation being formed by four 
friends. They plan to call it "I Make a Difference" and intend to devote the 
organization to raising money for individuals rather than causes such as cancer 
or AIDS, Gibbons said. The other group members are Dan Vogelzang, Sam Kuri and 
Doug Sakurai. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful," Dennyelle's mother, Karmen Von Bargen, said of the carnival 
plans, adding that they may help to save her daughter's life. 
</P>
<P>
Von Bargen was preparing to move to Oregon with her three children in late 
April when her daughter's leukemia was diagnosed and the child was 
hospitalized. Without the transplant, Dennyelle's chances of survival are 30% 
to 40%, doctors say. With it, the odds will improve to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
And if the money can be raised to pay for the procedure, Dennyelle's brother, 2 
1/2-year-old Justin, will be called upon to give of himself as well. He will be 
the bone marrow donor. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows he's going to help sissy out, but he doesn't understand everything," 
said Karmen Von Bargen, who is staying with friends in Garden Grove along with 
Justin and another daughter, Autumn, 7. 
</P>
<P>
Dennyelle, a bouncing ball of energy with a fondness for saying "No" and "I 
don't know," does not seem bothered by her situation. In isolation at Childrens 
Hospital of Orange County in Orange, she is surrounded by toys and family 
photos and has earned an affectionate reputation among the hospital's nurses as 
a "wild child." 
</P>
<P>
The transplant procedure, scheduled for next month, involves high doses of 
chemotherapy to induce remission in the leukemia and kill Dennyelle's bone 
marrow, Dr. Felicity Hodder said. Bone marrow collected with a needle from 
Justin's hip bone will be filtered into a blood transfusion bag and returned 
through a tube in Dennyelle's chest, Hodder added. 
</P>
<P>
The bone marrow will circulate through Dennyelle's blood stream and then, if 
all goes well, settle in the right spot and begin to replenish her own supply. 
Bone marrow makes blood cells, which are defective in leukemia cases. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said the group hopes the carnival will raise at least $20,000. SHANNON

PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF; SPEED HUMPS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a scene that has been repeated in many neighborhoods: A once-slow and 
quiet residential street is gradually transformed into a shortcut for motorists 
trying to avoid the congestion packing nearby main routes. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a development that residents of Glenview Avenue and Holbrook Street 
here have fought for more than two years, with hopes of keeping their housing 
tract peaceful and safe. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, their persistence finally paid off. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved six speed humps for each street, and the 
speed-control devices will soon be put in place for a six-month trial period. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just great," said Marcia Clarke, a member of the neighborhood group that 
numbered more than 100 members at times. "I guess the words of wisdom are 
persistence." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many groups that bring concerns before the City Council -- often with 
signed petitions to show community consensus -- these neighborhood residents 
also brought detailed plans and well-researched solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't just pull speed humps out of the hat one day," Clarke said. "We've 
worked real hard to get the information and get everything documented." 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the humps despite reports from the Engineering and Police 
departments and the city attorney against them. Humps are wider and lower than 
traditional bumps that are often found in parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic Engineer Paul Singer said that since humps are not considered standard 
devices for controlling traffic by state and federal authorities, there is 
little documentation of their effectiveness. Singer also warned that since 
there are no formal guidelines for building humps, they might be installed 
incorrectly, leaving the city liable for accidents that might result. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department also added other concerns, noting that skateboarders, 
bicyclists and motorcyclists might use the humps as jumps and that speeding 
motorists could lose control of their vehicles if they are caught off guard by 
the devices. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, with a few thousand vehicles passing through the two streets each 
day, some traveling as fast as 40 miles an hour, the council agreed with the 
residents that it was time to try something. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa and Yorba Linda currently have speed humps on some residential 
streets. The 12 humps planned for Glenview Avenue and Holbrook Street will cost 
about $16,500 and are scheduled to be installed by the start of next school 
year. LISA MASCARO

3-DAY SEMINAR GIVES STUDENTS DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of the weekend, 15-year-old Leslie Rhee knew what she wanted to do 
in life. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo High School sophomore had determined to start her own 
organization to help disadvantaged youth. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rhee, about 139 sophomores from Southern California high schools had 
career paths on their minds over the last few days. All attended the Hugh 
O'Brian Youth Foundation Leadership Seminar, a three-day event created by the 
star of TV's "Wyatt Earp" to bring students face to face with business, 
industry, education and government leaders and to show them how the American 
incentive system works. 
</P>
<P>
For many students, selected to attend the seminar for their leadership 
activities in high school, the event at Chapman College in Orange gave them an 
extra dose of self-confidence and motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest thing about this program is that it teaches that you can be who 
you want to be," Rhee said. 
</P>
<P>
While the sessions, such as "Advertising and Marketing in the 1990s" and 
"Starting Your Own Business," sounded like they came from the Harvard Business 
School, students said the classes helped them think for themselves. And 
students were more than willing to begin considering their planned professions, 
even with much of high school and college ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be a success in life, surround yourself with people who are 
smarter or more talented than you," Don Krampe, president of a Long Beach 
investment firm, told Rhee's seminar group. "You will learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
"You can do anything you want to, have anything you want to, be anyone if you 
believe in yourself," said Krampe, who is O'Brian's brother. "Don't let anyone 
steal your dream." 
</P>
<P>
His message, often repeated over the weekend, got across. One speaker asked 
students if any wanted to be president. About a dozen raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend included a talent show and dance, as well as seminars by leaders 
from such companies as Western Digital Corp., Rusty Pelican Restaurants, 
McDonnell Douglas Pacific and Asia Ltd. and The Times Orange County Edition. 
Students also played the Reward Game, a mock version of Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Two students, Adil Karim of Point Loma High School, and Carrie Hemphill of Los 
Alamitos High School, were chosen to attend an international leadership seminar 
in Minneapolis next month. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students, who said they differ from their peers in that they are 
more concerned about their futures, said the weekend gave them a refreshing 
chance to meet people with the same mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know where we're going to go," said Jennifer Hartman, 15, of Carlsbad 
High School. "We all want something in life. We don't want to just sit on the 
beach and eat." 
</P>
<P>
Hartman and Rhee, along with other members of their seminar group, chatted 
Sunday outside an auditorium at the college, reiterating what they plan to do 
after high school. Hartman said she hopes to go to either Stanford University 
or the University of Washington to study to be a pediatrician specializing in 
childhood diseases. After this weekend, she has few reservations about the 
prospect of eight to 10 years of college. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of nervous about going to school for that long," Hartman said, "but 
not now." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Koehn, 16, of Moreno Valley High School said he had planned to seek a job 
at an engineering or architectural firm. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be an engineer," he said. "Now I'm more open to business. I'm 
more open to starting my own engineering business or architectural firm." TED 
JOHNSON

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER SPECIAL TAX DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With two major residential projects scheduled for development within the next 
18 months, city officials are considering requiring homeowners in all future 
housing tracts to pay higher property taxes as a way of offsetting the costs of 
new public facilities and additional police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will take the first step toward that end today as it looks 
into establishing the city's first Mello-Roos special tax district.

A housing development on the 36-acre area bracketed by Ellis Avenue, Golden 
West Street, Edwards Street and Garfield Avenue is under consideration. Deeming 
it a Mello-Roos Community Facilities District would set future homeowners' 
total annual property tax at 1.41%. First-year taxes would average about $2,366 
in the 113-home tract, according to a report prepared by Deputy City 
Administrator Robert J. Franz. 
</P>
<P>
Current city residents would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the tax-district debate may represent the first step in creating 
a citywide policy to mandate that future homeowners in new developments pay 
higher taxes for city services. After council members decide whether to approve 
this week's Mello-Roos proposal, city planners are expected to turn their 
attention to devising guidelines for similar special tax districts in the 
massive Bolsa Chica and Holly Seacliff developments. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state's Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982, a city may levy 
a special property tax in a specified area -- exceeding the 1% limitation set 
by Proposition 13 -- to pay for improvements such as gutters and storm drains, 
as well as additional police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
The Mello-Roos tax revenue would repay a $2.5-million bond over the next 20 
years to widen and improve Ellis Avenue, now a two-lane farm road west of 
Golden West Street. Money from the bond will also pay for installing gutters, 
sewers and other public amenities, and it will provide $40,000 to $50,000 worth 
of additional police and fire services each year. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves creation of the Mello-Roos district, it would be 
implemented upon approval of the majority of the area's seven landowners. JOHN 
PENNER

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES;

<P>
IS PIONEERING SPIRIT HISTORY IN IRVINE?; 
</P>
<P>
ONLY TIME WILL TELL IF SALLY ANNE SHERIDAN WILL CONTINUE THE TRADITION OF 
INNOVATION SET FORTH BY LARRY AGRAN.

Now what? That seems to be the most frequently asked question in Irvine these 
days. After a hard fought and down to the wire campaign, Irvine Mayor Larry 
Agran narrowly lost his bid for reelection to Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan. 
Along with Sheridan's victory comes a new council majority composed of her 
allies, Art Bloomer and Barry Hammond who each won a seat on the City Council. 
Mayor-elect Sheridan, a real estate agent in her sixth year on the Irvine 
council, has said, "It's time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this was not an election based solely on issues. It was about 
partisan politics and personalities. You know how it is in Orange County: The 
Republicans are the good guys and the Democrats are the bad guys. Sheridan's 
campaign talked about being a Republican. I'm a Republican, too, but that 
shouldn't matter in a nonpartisan race. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the campaign Sheridan waged, it's difficult to know what she intends 
to do as mayor, but her campaign was clear on one point: Vote against Agran 
because he's a liberal Democrat (code words for "he's a bad guy"). The Lincoln 
Club -- an elite group of Republicans based in Fullerton, largely supported by 
money from developers -- spent $25,000 in last-minute mailers, joining Sheridan 
in getting that point across. 
</P>
<P>
I've lived in Irvine for 23 years, and I know Irvine issues: growth, traffic, 
open space and parks, and public safety. But instead of being exposed to the 
candidates' positions on these issues, voters were exposed to a media feeding 
frenzy of personal attacks, most of them aimed at Agran. The candidates for 
City Council -- I was one of them -- were virtually ignored. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder there is uncertainty about the direction of this new council 
majority. Partisan politics obscure the issue-oriented and nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
So just what can we expect from this change in leadership in Irvine? Can we 
really expect a change away from the Agran agenda? I don't think so. I have 
served on the council with Agran and Sheridan for the last two years. Under 
Agran's leadership, Irvine was the first city in Orange County to begin a 
curbside recycling program that now involves 70% of Irvine's eligible 
households. Agran established the county's first hazardous materials management 
and emergency cleanup program in Irvine, which has now been transferred to the 
county for broad implementation. 
</P>
<P>
The council also adopted the first local policy in the nation that mandates 
affordable, quality child care in response to demands created by the two 
wage-earner families that dominate Irvine's population. A volunteer "second 
harvest" is under way, where residents join with Irvine's farmers to glean more 
than 100,000 pounds per year of fresh fruit and vegetables for Orange County 
families who cannot afford to put food on the table. 
</P>
<P>
All these programs were built with a nonpartisan approach and have stood the 
test of time. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the environment. Irvine has become known as America's 
"environmental city" -- an urban community where one-third of the land is 
planned as open space; where the San Joaquin marsh -- 590 acres of the last 
remaining freshwater wetlands in Orange County -- is being saved through city 
leadership coupled with state and private funds. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine is also addressing water conservation through an environmental approach 
to the landscaping of public areas. The council has adopted a policy of 
doubling the number of trees in the city by the year 2000. We're even meeting 
the challenge of reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
Now, under Irvine's newly elected regime, Sheridan says she will, "get back to 
basics" and return city government to the business of "filling potholes." Yet 
the successful programs of recent years have benefited all of us. Programs like 
these would be difficult for any City Council to dismantle. So, what's going to 
change? 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious shift in direction may be the approach to new development. The 
council under Agran took growth control as a mandate from the voters and 
approved fewer than 3,000 new dwelling units. This may change under Sheridan. 
Repeatedly, she has contended that approval of the pending Irvine Co. projects, 
totaling nearly 12,000 new dwelling units in Irvine, is the most effective way 
to combat a severe shortage of housing. 
</P>
<P>
Another significant, but more subtle, change can be described as "initiative." 
Larry Agran thrived on taking the initiative. He is a modern-day pioneer with 
the arrows in his back to prove it. Losing the election was the political price 
he paid for being first. Never mind that 95% of the programs he initiated stand 
out as hallmarks in Irvine's history. 
</P>
<P>
Or that cities throughout Orange County followed in his footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent example of Mayor Agran's initiative is his proposed Irvine 
monorail project. Orange County needs a mass transit system that gets commuters 
to and from work quickly, inexpensively and without polluting our air. Agran 
wanted Irvine to be first. So he led the charge to include the Irvine monorail 
project in the statewide Rail Bond issue in Proposition 116. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Agran's work and the passage of Proposition 116, Irvine is 
eligible for $125 million in matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's new council is faced with picking up where Agran left off. Only time 
will tell if Sheridan will continue the Agran tradition of initiative and 
innovation. For Irvine's sake, I hope she does.

KIRBY-DODD UPSET SILVA-OPALINSKI IN FINAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't fault Karolyn Kirby for stumbling a little with her victory speech after 
she and partner Patty Dodd won the Huntington Beach Open pro beach volleyball 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"The TV crew was asking me all kinds of questions and I wasn't sure what to 
say," Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby may have been at a loss for words, but she and Dodd had no trouble 
upsetting top-seeded Jackie Silva and Janice Opalinski, 15-6, in the final at 
the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd and Kirby, seeded second, became the only team other than Silva and 
Opalinski to win a tournament this season. Silva and Opalinski entered the 
final with a five-tournament victory streak. 
</P>
<P>
It also was the first pro beach championship for Kirby, who is in her third 
year on the tour. Dodd won the Huntington Beach Open with Silva last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so totally psyched," Kirby said. "I think people were getting tired of 
seeing the same team winning. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to beat the best team in the finals and we did. This is sweet." 
</P>
<P>
Kirby, who lives in San Diego, and Dodd, of El Segundo, earned $3,000 each for 
the victory. Silva of Redondo Beach and Opalinski of San Juan Capistrano won 
$2,250 each. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes this so special was that (Kirby) got her first win on the tour," 
said Dodd, who won 13 of 16 tournaments last year with Silva. "I hope it's the 
first of many wins." 
</P>
<P>
Kirby and Dodd also beat Silva and Opalinski, 15-8, earlier Sunday in the 
winner's bracket final of the double-elimination tournament. Kirby and Dodd 
rallied from an 8-5 deficit, scoring 10 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
They won the final in similar fashion, breaking a 5-5 tie with an 8-0 run. 
Kirby finished with 12 kills and Dodd had 11. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was a difficult one for Opalinski and Silva, who formed their 
partnership in April, two weeks before the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit here and I wonder how it feels," Opalinski said. "We would've liked to 
keep it (the win streak) going, but this will motivate me to come back and play 
well next week." 
</P>
<P>
Silva agreed. "It's good for us to lose," she said. "Now we'll take a step back 
and think about our mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
One of their problems was serving. Usually one of the top serving teams on the 
tour, Silva and Opalinski struggled with 10 service errors and had only one ace 
in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wasn't there for us," Opalinski said. 
</P>
<P>
It was for Dodd and Kirby, who had two aces each. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to serve them well because they're both such great ball-control 
players," Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
She and Dodd have had ample time to work on their game plan against Silva and 
Opalinski. 
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time in six tour stops the teams have met in the finals. 
Kirby and Dodd finished second in three previous tournaments this year and 
third in two others. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have our focus the first few times we met in the finals," Kirby 
said. "Patty and I were nervous and we were still getting to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference today was this was the first time we came in thinking we had a 
chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
And now, if they can just work on that victory speech. . . .

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL;

<P>
DOUG LINTON MAKING HIS PITCH TO COME BACK FROM SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With each pitch Doug Linton throws in triple A, he knows he is one step away 
from making it to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But each time he moves his arm forward, Linton also knows he is fortunate to be 
pitching at all. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Linton has a 5-4 record and 3.25 earned-run average in 11 starts 
for the Syracuse Chiefs, the Toronto Blue Jays' triple-A team. He has allowed 
61 hits and has 49 strikeouts in 69 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Although hampered somewhat by a pulled calf muscle he suffered earlier this 
season, Linton has been improving recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel about 85%," he said. "But my arm is getting stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Linton, 24, played at UC Irvine and Canyon High School, and started his minor 
league career in 1987 at Myrtle Beach, one of the Toronto organization's 
Class-A affiliates, and had unimaginable success. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 14-2 record, with 154 strikeouts and a 1.55 ERA in 122 innings, thanks 
mostly to a slider that people in the Blue Jay organization were already 
calling "a big league pitch." Everything seemed to be going well, and by 
mid-August, Linton was promoted to Toronto's double-A team in Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
But as Linton was warming up one day in Knoxville, the dream season dissolved 
into a shoulder ache. The pain continued, sending him to the doctor, where it 
was discovered he had a tear in the rotator cuff of his right shoulder. Surgery 
was performed Aug. 29, 1987, and Linton missed most of the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
Linton returned in the final six weeks of the season to pitch 27 1/3 innings at 
Dunedin, a class-A team in the Florida State League. He was 2-1 with a 1.63 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, I was just learning to throw again and it was depressing," Linton 
said. "I was thinking that maybe I should go back and get that college 
education . . . But then things slowly started to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Linton began last season at Dunedin, where he was 1-2 in 27 innings. He was 
moved to Knoxville and went 5-4 with a 2.60 ERA in 90 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just nice to be back throwing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Linton further tested his arm last winter pitching for a Venezuelan team, going 
5-2, including a shutout in the Caribbean World Series. But Linton did find a 
difference or two playing in South America. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be sitting on the bench and there would be a soldier next to it with, 
like, an AK-47 rifle," he said. "Now that's something we don't see in the 
states much." 
</P>
<P>
Linton's confidence was much improved after a strong winter, but he quickly 
learned another lesson in a minor league spring training game. He had given up 
five runs in the first two innings, when he was told by his coaches that he was 
relying too much on his breaking pitches. 
</P>
<P>
He had three more innings to go and was allowed to throw only his fastball and 
changeup. 
</P>
<P>
Linton retired the next nine batters. 
</P>
<P>
"They say I fall in love with my slider and overuse it," Linton said. "It 
showed me that I can get people out with other pitches, and anyway, I'll need 
everything I've got if I make it up to the big club." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Gary Carter, the current San Francisco Giant and former Montreal 
Expo and New York Met, was a football, baseball and basketball standout at 
Sunny Hills High School, where he graduated in 1972. But in what sport and to 
what college did Carter sign a letter of intent before being drafted by the 
Expos in 1972? 
</P>
<P>
Big time prediction: In 1988, Fullerton College Coach Nick Fuscardo said 
freshman pitcher Alan Newman would reach the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Newman is playing in Class A for the Minnesota Twin team in 
Kenosha, Wis. But he is starting to dominate hitters the way Fuscardo 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Newman, from La Habra High School, is 7-2 with a 1.60 ERA. He has allowed 51 
hits in 90 innings and has 79 strikeouts. He is still battling with control 
though, as his 49 walks prove. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as he stays healthy, he'll get there," Fuscardo said. "He just needs 
time to develop. When he was with us (in 1988), we started him slowly. At 
first, we let him face just a batter, then maybe two and build from there." 
</P>
<P>
Newman pitched in a team-high 21 games for Fullerton but had only 32 1/3 
innings. His most impressive statistic was that opponents hit .100 (15 for 150) 
against him. He was 1-3 with a save and had 49 strikeouts and 34 walks. 
</P>
<P>
"His ball started in the strike zone but just exploded out," Fuscardo said. 
"His ball ran like a dog. He came a long way with us and has kept improving." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Carter was an All-American quarterback and signed with UCLA 
before deciding on a professional baseball career.

COALESCENCE OF BIG-NAME TALENT AT SEGERSTROM HALL

Multidirectional is the term drummer Jack DeJohnette uses to label his music. 
And the eclectic mix of standards, accessible originals and extended free-form 
excursions heard from his big-name quartet Friday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center proved how apt his term is. 
</P>
<P>
In a long, two-set program, DeJohnette, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Dave 
Holland and guitarist Pat Metheny ranged across time and space. Despite muddy, 
reverberating sound in cavernous Segerstrom Hall (a not uncommon problem when 
amplified music is performed in spacious concert facilities), the evening 
combined impressive individual virtuosity with solid, empathetic ensemble work 
into a satisfying, well-varied program. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that this assemblage of all-stars worked so well as a unit was one of 
the evening's surprises. There were no extended, unaccompanied solos that saw 
the other musicians desert the stage while an ego was indulged. Instead, the 
band remained together, trading lines, sharing the lead duties and reinforcing 
each others' work with intelligent accompaniment. This is one superstar quartet 
where the emphasis is on the group rather than the stars. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Metheny, each of the unit's members has experience 
playing for Miles Davis, so it was appropriate that the group opened with 
"Solar," a Davis tune first recorded in the early '50s. This melodic reference 
to a bit of shared history featured Hancock's wily acoustic solo, DeJohnette's 
touch-conscious percussion and -- though it was difficult to hear in the mix -- 
crisp, responsive groundwork from Holland on upright acoustic. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast "Solar" with the contemporary-sounding Metheny-DeJohnette 
collaboration "Nine Over Reggae," which appears on the group's recent release, 
"Parallel Realities." Holland switched to electric bass (something he's ignored 
for the last 15 years), Metheny coaxed glossy synthesized tones from one of an 
array of guitars he used, and Hancock moved to electric keyboards, where he 
added color as well as rhythmic interest from programmed sounds. Despite its 
easy-to-follow beat (which had little to do with actual reggae), the tune was a 
showcase for DeJohnette, who provided an endless stream of embellishments and 
offbeat accents to keep things interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Different still was DeJohnette's "Silver Hollow" (from his 1978 "New 
Directions" recording), a smooth, pastoral piece that opened with a sweet 
acoustic solo from Metheny. DeJohnette's mallet work and delicate tracking of 
the rhythm with subdued hi-hat claps made for a marvel of tasteful reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's high points, though, were two extended, seemingly free-form 
pieces that worked a variety of tempos and high-pitched emotions, combining 
sounds that ranged from thunderous electronic effects to a ringing telephone. 
</P>
<P>
One of these adventurous efforts, the title track from the new album, featured 
Metheny's screaming-yet-melodic synthesizer solo over DeJohnette's breakneck 
tom-tom rolls, while Hancock added muted trumpet tones from his synthesizer 
that recalled (who else?) Miles Davis. The music was accompanied by an 
unnerving light show that must have brought back the Summer of Love and nights 
at the Filmore to more than a few in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the variety of the program was Hancock's "Eye of the Hurricane," 
which featured the pianist's appropriately stormy improvisation; a Latin-tinged 
rendition of Ornette Coleman's "The Good Life"; and, as an encore, Hancock's 
funky "Cantaloupe Island."

SCRATCH AN ADULT, FIND A CRAYON KID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY ALLEN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not that anybody was frightened or outraged to learn Binney &amp; Smith, the 
maker of Crayola crayons, is replacing eight colors, but in the manner of 
sleeping dogs lifting their heads at the first sound of thunder, we paid 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
TV news was all over this story, and USA Today put it on the front page. No 
wonder. Messing with Crayola crayons is like messing with the rainbow or the 
spectrum, with the prism of the American psyche. 
</P>
<P>
The facts: Binney &amp; Smith is replacing blue gray, green blue, violet blue, 
orange red, orange yellow, lemon yellow, maize and raw umber, which will go 
into the Crayola Crayon Hall of Fame in Easton, Pa., according to company 
spokeswoman Lina Striglia. In fact, they will be the only things in the Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
They will be replaced by fuchsia, vivid tangerine, jungle green, cerulean, 
dandelion, teal blue, wild strawberry and royal purple. Only the first four 
will go into the box of 24, five in the box of 32, six in the box of 48 and all 
of them in the box of 64 -- the one with the sharpener -- and, of course, in 
the box of 72, which includes the fluorescents and pastels, but not the 
legendary flesh, which was renamed peach in 1962 when the company recognized 
that flesh comes in different colors. 
</P>
<P>
Not all change is bad. 
</P>
<P>
The new ones sound better, to judge from the names. Besides, even if they 
weren't, it's not as if the company were replacing the original eight crayons 
introduced in 1903, ones you can still buy today in boxes that say "different, 
brilliant colors": red, blue, green, yellow, orange, brown, violet and black, 
double-wrapped in that soft, gripable paper and smelling of rainy days and car 
trips; a smell of paraffin so memorable it's one of the 20 most recognizable 
smells among American adults, according to Binney &amp; Smith (the first two 
being peanut butter and coffee), although it's strange that something that 
smells as distinct as a crayon has almost no taste, just the feel of those waxy 
crumbs in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
We don't need lots of the colors in the bigger crayon boxes -- think what a 
disappointment silver and gold always were. They looked great, you figured you 
could do great ray guns and crowns with them, and then they just came out shiny 
gray and brown. (The company, though, says the "metallics," as it calls them, 
are often mentioned by adults as their childhood favorites.) 
</P>
<P>
We have all crayoned. 
</P>
<P>
Think of this the next time you see some pin-striped executive gliding down the 
sidewalk toward you in all his dignity -- picture him working away at a 
spaceship-monster shoot-out. Know that he felt bad just as you did when he 
broke one and said to himself he shouldn't have pressed so hard and tried to 
pretend it hadn't happened. Finally he had to tear the paper and crayon in half 
to make two short crayons. These always fell to the bottom of the box when he 
put them back, which made the other ones stick up too high, and so those 
perfect rows of crayons that were lined up in the fresh box like organ pipes or 
a choir were ruined. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the pristinity, the virginity, the infinity offered by a brand-new box of 
crayons. And then you'd look around the floor of your room at the end of an 
afternoon of coloring and see the squalid mess of paper and crayons and the 
stuff your kid brother had scribbled on the wall just as you heard your mother 
say the three sentences that awoke you from so many reveries: 
</P>
<P>
"Oh. 
</P>
<P>
"My. 
</P>
<P>
"God." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, after the shock of hearing about the new colors -- the first since the 
fluorescents (hot magenta, ultra green, ultra orange, ultra red, ultra blue, 
ultra yellow, chartreuse and ultra pink) of 1972 -- they sound OK. They come 
out of interviews with 150 kids. The discarded colors are not apt to be missed 
-- they tended to be the ones you used when you ran out of another color, 
except they never quite matched unless you colored the whole thing over. 
</P>
<P>
"Violet purple -- who cares?" says Peter Dunne, 46, a corporate communications 
manager who lives in North Haledon, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
He learned how to color in his cousins' apartment in Brooklyn. "They had a shoe 
box full of crayon pieces, two girls. Girls color better than boys. It was 
there that I learned how to outline areas in the same color. As you get older 
you learn to color in the same direction, instead of like an asterisk. If you 
had to fill in big areas it was best to color in circles that overlapped. If 
you colored until there were layers built up, the crayon clicked when you took 
it off the paper. When you grow up, you can use oil pastels -- they're more 
like lipstick. The color saturation is great but you don't have the edge 
control. Grease pencils are fun. When you were a kid, remember how you'd always 
pull that string back one dot too far? 
</P>
<P>
"I still like to color. If it rains at the beach and you've already bought 
sandals, you go to the Ben Franklin and get crayons and a coloring book, except 
they call them activity books now. I leave them behind at the house, and the 
next tenants come in and their kids say, "Wow, a major leaguer was here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Binney &amp; Smith make 2 billion crayons a year. Crayons begin life when you 
open the box and see that gorgeous chord of color in 72-part harmony (or that 
perfect octet of the original eight). They end up in dusty cacophony under car 
seats, behind bookcases, under porches. They melt on sidewalks and windowsills, 
and they are never the same again. 
</P>
<P>
Your mother carried them in her purse, and after you got tired of looking at 
the tropical fish at the dentist's office, she'd take them out with a coloring 
book and say: "Color me a picture." 
</P>
<P>
You'd come back and show it to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I went outside the lines," you'd say. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best part," she'd say. You still thought it looked stupid. 
</P>
<P>
Your parents told you not to sharpen them in the pencil sharpener because they 
would ruin it; you did anyway, and they ruined it. 
</P>
<P>
You could take a fistful of them and draw a whole bunch of colors all at once, 
and it would look like when the fighters go over at the air show and let out 
the different-colored streams of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
When they got small enough, you peeled the paper off and pushed them sideways 
across the page, but without the label you couldn't be sure what color they 
were anymore. 
</P>
<P>
These things will not change.

L.A. Gear -- A June 13 story in View incorrectly reported the earnings for L.A. 
Gear's second quarter. In fact, the company announced it earned a profit during 
that period, but that its earnings were down as much as 40% from a year 
earlier.

Government medical research is so sexually biased that even male laboratory

today.

"What it's really saying is, it's OK to put women's health at risk," Rep. 
Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on 
Health and the Environment. 
</P>
<P>
She was among critics who say clinical trials and the resulting data are skewed 
in favor of men. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of gender-specific data "communicates to doctors that women really 
aren't that much at risk," she said. As a result, women's problems often aren't 
taken seriously until they reach a critical stage. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institutes of Health has a $7.6-billion research budget this year. 
An NIH advisory committee reported in 1987 that less than 14% of the 
institute's budget went to women's health issues even though women make up more 
than half the population, Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Only $17 million is spent on basic breast cancer research annually, and less 
than 2% of NIH grants for research went to obstetric and gynecological programs 
in 1986 and 1987, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Heart disease and cancers of the lung and breast are the top killers of women.

<P>
The leading conservative on the Soviet Politburo, Yegor K. Ligachev, today 
criticized advocates of a free market and called for a referendum on whether 
the nation should be capitalist or socialist. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev spoke out in an interview published by the Communist Party newspaper 
Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
In two weeks, the party is to open a crucial congress to debate the course of 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's ask the people what direction restructuring should take -- to socialism 
or capitalism. Let's hold a national referendum," Ligachev said. 
</P>
<P>
He outlined a traditional Marxist-Leninist position that contrasted sharply 
with calls for reform being heard in the Soviet media and legislative bodies, 
and he urged that the nation stick with a planned market economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who advocate a free market are pushing us back to private appropriation 
of the results of the labor of other people to their exploitation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have already realized the destructiveness of such 'freedom' at the 
macrolevel, when large units and republics try to secede from an integrated 
community, thereby harming other republics and peoples," he said, alluding to 
the steps toward independence by the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and 
Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reformist weekly Ogonyok published results of an opinion poll 
that indicated diminished support for the Communist Party among Soviet 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the All-Union Center for the Study of Public Opinion. 
It said that of Soviets surveyed last month, 49% believed the Communist Party 
was "losing the initiative."

A pair of storage batteries that either shorted out or overheated sparked a 
fire that filled a Disney film production building in Burbank with thick smoke 
today but caused no injuries and little damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A Walt Disney Co. spokesman said the only people in the building when the fire 
broke out about 5:45 a.m. were security personnel. The fire was doused shortly 
after 6 a.m.

PLO guerrillas swept through a refugee camp in southern Lebanon today and 
disarmed followers of the notorious terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The operation followed weekend fighting between supporters and opponents of Abu 
Nidal within his Fatah-Revolutionary Council group. At least five people were 
killed in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Police said about 100 Palestine Liberation Organization military policemen 
seized all weapons of Abu Nidal's followers in a house-to-house search in the 
Rashidiyeh refugee camp, outside Tyre. 
</P>
<P>
"Abu Nidal's base in Rashidiyeh has been dismantled. He has no followers left 
here," said a police spokesman in Tyre. 
</P>
<P>
He said 40 Abu Nidal loyalists surrendered to the PLO on Sunday, and a dozen 
were arrested in today's operation.

U.S. ENVOY, NOT CIA AGENT, BLAMED IN MANDELA ARREST

A U.S. diplomat based in South Africa, and not a CIA agent, was responsible for 
the 1962 arrest of black leader Nelson R. Mandela, who was incarcerated for 27 
years, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Afrikaans daily Beeld, rebutting a report in the Johannesburg Sunday Times 
that the CIA was involved in Mandela's capture, quoted anonymous "senior police 
officers" as denying that the agency was directly involved in the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said an unnamed staffer at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria leaked 
details of the fugitive anti-apartheid activist's movements to a 
noncommissioned security policeman who was a "good friend." 
</P>
<P>
"The diplomat told the policeman certain things in conversation which led (the 
policeman) to Mandela's trail," a senior officer told Beeld. 
</P>
<P>
That information resulted in Mandela's arrest at a roadblock the night of Aug. 
5, 1962, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times had named Millard Shirley, who was reportedly head of covert 
operations in southern Africa in the 1960s, as the CIA agent who engineered 
Mandela's arrest, quoting retired South African police spy Gerard Ludi. 
</P>
<P>
Ludi speculated that the U.S. government wanted Mandela "out of the way" 
because of his links to communism, particularly the South African Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
"During the '60s, Communist expansion in Africa was one of America's biggest 
bugbears," Ludi said. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley retired in 1973 and died in a car accident in Swaziland in 1988.

<P>
The heirs of the Communist Party have won control of Parliament in Bulgaria's 
first free elections in 58 years, but unofficial results today showed the 
capital firmly in opposition hands. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's ruling Socialists are the only reform Communists to hold onto power 
in an Eastern Europe nation where authoritarian rule gave way to popular 
elections this year after decades of Soviet domination. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Andrei Lukanov today said he was confident that he could form a 
government with broad support. He said he was encouraged by the main opposition 
coalition's support for a government of nonpartisan administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Bulgaria's Communist Party formed the Socialist Party and state-run 
Sofia radio said unofficial final results showed the Socialists won 39 of the 
81 seats at stake in Sunday's run-offs. That would give them them a total of 
211 seats in the 400-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The main opposition alliance, the Union of Democratic Forces, won 37 seats for 
a total of 144, the radio said. Among those were 6 more seats in Sofia to give 
the alliance 24 of the capital's 26 seats, unofficial counts showed. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition in this country of 9 million gets much of its backing from the 
urban intelligentsia, while the Socialists are seen as a force for stability in 
the Balkan country's more conservative countryside.

A Soviet pilot landed a small plane on a beach on the Black Sea coast today and 
requested political asylum, a government official said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass news agency reported in Moscow that an AN-2 plane was hijacked in Izmail, 
near the Ukrainian port of Odessa. 
</P>
<P>
The Turkish official said the pilot was alone in the 12-seat Soviet passenger 
plane when it landed near Kumcagiz village in Kocaeli province at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
There are no airports in the province, and the plane landed on a beach known as 
Kefken, the official said. He said the Soviets immediately asked Turkey to 
return the plane and the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The semiofficial Anatolia news agency identified the pilot as Valeri Yurevic, 
29. He was reportedly taken to a police station for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the pilot had resigned several months ago from his job with an Odessa 
air crew. It did not give further details.

Cuba surprised international analysts today by announcing a

Granma, the official Communist Party newspaper, described the 8.04-million-ton 
crop as a "real labor achievement by our workers." Sugar is the traditional 
mainstay of the Cuban economy, and the island is the world's biggest exporter.

A jury consisting of mostly black women was seated today in the cocaine and 
perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry and was immediately placed in the care of 
U.S. marshals for the duration of the case. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson scheduled opening statements 
in the case for Tuesday morning and said the jurors will be sworn in at that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The judge told them they would collect their belongings and be sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
The panel of 12 people plus 6 alternates includes 13 blacks and 5 whites. There 
are just three men among them. Barry, 54, is black, and a number of prospective 
jurors questioned in the past two weeks said they thought race and politics 
played a role in the investigation and prosecution of the three-term mayor. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the group of 18 won't be told which are jurors and which are 
being held as alternates. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. marshals will transport them between the U.S. Courthouse and an area 
hotel, where they will be housed until the trial is over.

A cease-fire collapsed into virtual civil war in Sri Lanka today, with the 
military accusing Tamil guerrillas of mortar attacks on army bases and the 
rebels saying the air force was strafing villages. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of a cease-fire now. 
</P>
<P>
The (Tamil) Tigers have broken it and we are going ahead trying to recapture 
our installations, defending our positions," a military officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The fresh outburst of fighting threatened to plunge the Indian Ocean island 
back into full-scale civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lankan security forces began large-scale, warlike troop movements and 
strengthened their positions in violation of the terms of the cease-fire which 
came into effect at 6 p.m. on Saturday," the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
They accused troops of setting fire to houses and said the air force had bombed 
and strafed various parts of the northeast. At least seven civilians were 
killed in the attacks, they said. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief lull in hostilities after Saturday's cease-fire, heavy fighting 
erupted between the Tigers and government troops in several parts of the 
northeast province late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 450 people, including rebels, security forces and civilians, have 
died since June 11 when the Tigers launched a spate of attacks on army and 
police bases in the north and east. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the fiercest battles broke out around an army camp in Kiran in eastern 
Trincomalee district. 
</P>
<P>
The military accused the rebels of pounding the camp with machine guns, mortars 
and rocket-propelled grenades and of using an unidentified gas in the 
onslaught.

The newly elected lower house of Parliament voted today to allow the police and 
army to move against anti-government demonstrators who retook a public square 
they were driven from last week. 
</P>
<P>
A senior opposition leader demanded that Parliament investigate the events that 
led President-elect Ion Iliescu to call coal miners in to put down last week's 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people gathered for a second day in University Square to demand the 
ouster of Iliescu, and students said they will go on strike Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Several miles away, another 300 people staged a pro-government demonstration 
outside Parliament, which was guarded by dozens of soldiers and police with 
machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu's inauguration had been scheduled for last week but has been postponed 
amid the turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Of the lawmakers present in the 377-member House of Deputies, only 72 voted 
against the motion to have "the forces of law and order" end the University 
Square demonstration. Seven abstained. 
</P>
<P>
The vote split generally along party lines, with deputies of Iliescu's National 
Salvation Front supporting the motion along with splinter parties loyal to the 
front and the three main opposition parties against. 
</P>
<P>
Passage was virtually certain in the Senate, where the National Salvation Front 
also holds a clear majority. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest began last Wednesday when police broke up an anti-Communist sit-in 
on the square. When the unrest continued, Iliescu called thousands of miners 
into the city, and they used clubs and iron bars to beat anyone they suspected 
of being anti-government. 
</P>
<P>
Six people were killed and more than 500 injured in the unrest, the worst since 
the December uprising that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Student leader Marian Munteanu was moved today from the Emergency Hospital to a 
police hospital after being charged with "instigation and participation in 
violence," according to his opposition group, the Students League.

Three equities markets announced this morning they have reached a definitive 
agreement to trade through the night using a computer network. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the 
Cincinnati Stock Exchange hope to capture some of the trading conducted abroad 
when it is nighttime in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The computer network will be provided by Reuters Holdings PLC. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges expect the system will begin working in two to three years, 
officials said at news conferences in New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The CBOE and AMEX would handle their stock options through the system and the 
Cincinnati Stock Exchange would offer U.S.-traded stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the details of how the system will work have yet to be determined, 
officials of the exchanges said at the press conferences, which were linked via 
television. The CBOE will build and operate the main computer for the system 
and Reuters will build the network that provides traders access to the markets' 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
Other exchanges, specifically the New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo 
Exchange, have been invited to join the system, officials said.

The Supreme Court today let the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate a 
new form of financial trading called index participations. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that gives the CFTC, rather 
than the Securities and Exchange Commission, such regulatory power. 
</P>
<P>
Index participations are contracts of indefinite duration based on the value of 
a group of securities. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC generally regulates securities, and the CFTC has jurisdiction over 
futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said last year that an 
index participation has elements of both a security and a futures contract. But 
the appeals court said the CFTC has exclusive jurisdiction over the investment 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruling was challenged by the American Stock Exchange, the 
Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Options 
Clearing Corp. The latter organization issues options that are traded on the 
exchanges.

The United States should stop nagging South Korea on bilateral trade issues and 
start working with Seoul as a cooperative partner, South Korea's top economic 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. economic relationship should be broadened," Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Economic Planning Lee Seung Yun told visiting American businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than somewhat narrowly focusing on bilateral issues and conflicting 
concerns as in the 1980s, we should strive for a mutually beneficial 
partnership in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
He slammed what he called the "interventionist practices of the United States," 
such as forcing South Koreans to impose so-called voluntary restraints on steel 
exports. "It would greatly help our efforts to reduce government intervention 
if the United States also reduces its government interventions restricting 
imports," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade representative's office over the last few years has threatened 
retaliation under the Super 301 provision of the revised trade act to pressure 
South Korea to open its markets to foreign-made goods and reduce its exports.

Banking sources said the executive was employed in the bank's foreign exchange 
section. He apparently cracked the bank's computer security system and 
transferred the money from the accounts of several clients into his own 
personal account, they said.

The Dance Theater of Harlem has received a $1-million grant and an estimated 
$250,000 worth of marketing expertise from American Express, the group's 
artistic director announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The $1 million, payable over four years, may be used for artistic, educational 
and social programs, said the artistic director, Arthur Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Cooperman, president of American Express Travel Related Services Co., 
said his company aims to help raise the annual funding that allows the dance 
company to perform and reach new audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, facing a potential $1.7-million deficit, the Dance Theater of 
Harlem laid off dancers, technicians and some administrative staff for six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
American Express will also co-sponsor events with local businesses when the 
dance company tours, helping to expand the series that brings children to 
dance. It will give seating preference to American Express card holders for 
some performances. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund announced a $1-million grant 
to the troupe.

2 LIVE CREW IS SUED OVER 'PRETTY WOMAN'

<P>
The controversial rap group 2 Live Crew made an unauthorized derivative 
recording of Roy Orbison's "Oh, Pretty Woman," a lawsuit contends. 
</P>
<P>
Acuff-Rose, a Nashville music publishing firm, said today it refused permission 
to allow 2 Live Crew to record the song but a derivative version appeared on 
the group's album, "As Clean As They Want To Be," the sanitized version of "As 
Nasty As They Want To Be." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not about talking dirty," said Acuff-Rose attorney Eddie Wayland, 
referring to the suit. "It's about copyright infringement." 
</P>
<P>
Named as defendants in the suit, filed in federal court, were band leader 
Luther Campbell and band member Christopher (Fresh Kid Ice) Wongwon. The two 
were also arrested in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., on obscenity charges last week. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as defendants were band members Mark (Brother Marquis) Ross and 
David (Mr. Mixx) Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
Acuff-Rose said it holds the copyright to "Oh, Pretty Woman" -- the song's full 
title -- which was a major hit for Orbison, co-written by the late singer and 
William Dees in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 Live Crew album credits Acuff-Rose and the composers. 
</P>
<P>
The Nashville publishing firm asked for unspecified damages and for the 
forfeiture of all copies of the album.

Late-night talk show host Arsenio Hall has been named TV Guide's first TV

The magazine also cited eight other TV personalities for distinguished work.

magazine said it will make the awards an annual event.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: 'MORNING AFTER' PILL WAS FOUND TO HOLD FUTURE RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, AND TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. I was married until last year and had been on birth control pills. After the 
divorce I didn't plan on needing any contraception for a long time so I stopped 
taking them. 
</P>
<P>
To my surprise I met someone recently I really like and got carried away one 
evening. I remembered that when I was in college the student health center 
provided a "morning-after" contraceptive for such situations. But my doctor 
didn't know what I was talking about when I called for a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily I didn't get pregnant, but I've been wondering what happened to the 
morning-after pill. 
</P>
<P>
A. Several decades ago DES (diethylstilbestrol) was used as a morning-after 
contraceptive. Unfortunately, it often caused nausea and vomiting in the high 
doses required. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, DES posed a long-term threat. Some young women exposed to DES before 
birth, when their mothers took it during pregnancy, develop a rare vaginal 
cancer. Once this danger of DES was discovered, most doctors stopped using it 
as a morning-after pill for fear that if it did not work and a daughter were 
born, she would be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has not approved any medication for use as a 
morning-after contraceptive but some physicians prescribe the birth control 
pill Ovral for this purpose. According to the Medical Letter of Drugs and 
Therapeutics, in the appropriate dose this medication is usually effective 
against pregnancy if it is taken within one to three days after intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Your column once carried a letter from a man who used a prescription 
athlete's foot cream for his itchy and scaly scalp. I think the medicine 
started with the letter "N." I wanted to save the article and ask my doctor if 
he'd prescribe that cream for me to try. Unfortunately, I've misplaced it. What 
was that stuff? 
</P>
<P>
A. The medicine in question was Nizoral (ketoconazole), a prescription 
anti-fungal agent effective for a variety of skin conditions. The cream has 
been shown to work against the scaling and flaking of seborrheic dermatitis. 
People with severe dandruff may also benefit.

WHAT I wonder about today is the rumor that George Steinbrenner is going to

next season. Well, that's what Reggie-ites are whispering on both coasts.

NBC'S LATE-NIGHT show, "Later With Bob Costas," has the CBS titan Dan Rather on 
for two nights -- Tuesday and Wednesday -- and the anchorman rates his 
competitor by saying: "Costas -- he's a hell of an interviewer!" 
</P>
<P>
BEING BOTH a hick and an incorrigible fan, I've never entered those hallowed 
gates of New York's "21" without seeing somebody special inside. The other 
night, the frisson of thrill came from looking up from the table I was sharing 
with Shirley "20/20" Clurman and her writer husband, Richard, and seeing Frank 
Sinatra standing there in black-tied glory. He had just come from his Radio 
City Music Hall concert and left a big table with his wife, Barbara, tycoon 
John Kluge, pal Judy Green, and that Hollywood glamour couple, Jilly and Tom 
Selleck, to come say hello. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing the Presidential Medal insignia in his lapel, Sinatra looked fabulous. 
In fact, he seemed to be more fit than I've seen dear Francis Albert in ages. 
Those of us who thrilled to his music in the '40s and followed his saga through 
the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s, always know he is a very special talent and 
still the biggest star of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
THE TOP-SECRET filming of spring-summer is taking place now on a hermetically 
sealed set at Pinewood Studios, outside London. The Universal movie is a 
contemporary English romantic comedy about the aristocracy, and director David 
S. Ward has quite a cast of dandies and eccentrics working for him -- Peter 
O'Toole, the British phenomenon who has progressed from being merely brilliant 
while drinking to being even more brilliant while sober . . . "Roseanne's" now 
less-hefty husband, John Goodman . . . and the fabled actor John Hurt, who has 
joined the "King Ralph I" cast in the role of the villain, Lord Percival 
Graves. . . . Walt Disney has signed the black British funnyman Lenny Henry to 
a major two-picture deal and (speaking of mega-stars), they hope to put him 
right into the big leagues with Eddie Murphy. . . . Producers Don Saxon and 
Robert Blume are working on a Broadway musical about the TV uncle of us all, 
Milton Berle, and Uncle Miltie is their consultant. (But I thought they already 
made a musical about Milton, titled "Top Banana.")

George Steinbrenner, the shipbuilding magnate and unpredictable owner of the 
New York Yankees, told graduating cadets at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy 
to dare to be different. 
</P>
<P>
"Be the uncommon man and woman," Steinbrenner urged the 119 cadets Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry too much about what you think society dictates, because it's the 
uncommon men of this country that have led it to greatness." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, who has hired 19 managers in the 17 years since he bought the 
Yankees, pressed the graduates to "pursue excellence at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
"There are those who will teach you that to win is a bad word," said the owner 
of the last-place ballclub. "It's not a bad word, but if you prefer to say 
pursuit of excellence, that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner was given an honorary doctorate "in recognition of his service in 
the American maritime industry."

HONUS WAGNER HIT HARD BY REVISION OF STATISTICS; 
</P>

HALL OF FAME: BASEBALL ENCYCLOPEDIA DROPS FAMED SHORTSTOP FROM 6TH TO 7TH ON

The Pittsburgh Pirates are unhappy about changes in Hall of Famer Honus 
Wagner's batting statistics that dropped him from sixth to seventh on the 
career hit list and from 26th to 29th in all-time averages. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, who played for the Pirates from 1900 to 1917, is listed in the eighth 
and latest edition of Macmillan's Baseball Encyclopedia with 12 fewer hits and 
a batting average .002 less than in previous editions. 
</P>
<P>
"What are they going to do, change his plaque in the Hall of Fame?" said Rick 
Cerrone, the Pirates' vice president for public relations. "They're a 
publisher, not a record-keeper; it's not their decision to make. They made the 
change without telling anyone in Major League Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The shortstop is now listed as having 3,418 hits, instead of 3,430, and a .327 
average instead of .329. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner also slipped from fifth to seventh in career doubles, losing eight, 
while Hall of Famer Nap Lajoie gained 10. 
</P>
<P>
The team says changes should have been made with consultation of the committee 
established by former Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti to approve such 
alterations in established records and statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Wolff, the encyclopedia's editor, said the changes resulted from input 
from various sources, including his research staff, the Baseball Hall of Fame 
and statisticians at the Elias Sports Bureau and the Society for American 
Baseball Research. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff authorized the changes because the record committee does not meet again 
until August, well after the book's publishing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff said research has corrected several errors that have slipped into 
baseball's official records over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, the first edition of the book, which is looked upon as the most 
pure record of baseball history by many historians, credits Wagner with three 
more hits than he now has and the same batting average," Wolff told The 
Pittsburgh Press. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in Wagner's statistics were made in the three seasons he played for 
Louisville, 1897-99.

HOT GIANTS CRACKING JUNE SWOON THEORY

How hot are the San Francisco Giants? Let us count the ways after a 9-7 victory 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* The Giants have won eight in a row, their longest winning streak since they 
won 10 straight from Aug. 3 to 11, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
* They are 15-1 this month, their hottest streak since the 1965 powerhouse of 
Willie Mays and Willie McCovey went 17-1 from Sept. 4 to 20. That club won 14 
in a row and finished second with a 95-67 record. 
</P>
<P>
* Convincingly destroying the myth of the June Swoon, the Giants are heading 
for their best month in San Francisco. The record is an 18-5 April in 1971. The 
June standard is 19-11 in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
* They have won nine straight at home, their best streak at Candlestick Park 
since the 1982 club also won nine in a row from July 28 to Aug. 11. The 1990 
Giants lost their first eight at home. 
</P>

* The Giants are averaging 12.4 hits and 7.6 runs with a .328 batting average 
this month. They have collected 10 or more hits 12 times in 16 June games, 
including 15 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* The hitting frenzy has overshadowed a recent stretch of sturdy pitching. The 
Giants have posted a 2.65 earned run average over the last 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
* The team leads the National League with 626 hits and 328 runs. No team is 
playing better against the West. 
</P>
<P>
Things are going so well, in fact, that the giddy Giants are starting to 
believe they might have a better ballclub than the one that reached the World 
Series with a 92-70 record and a blitz of the Chicago Cubs in the 1989 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The major difference from last year's team is the rise of third baseman Matt 
Williams, who extended his career-high hitting streak to 14 games Sunday with 
two doubles and a single. His two RBI gave him the NL lead with 55. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a pretty good groove," Williams said. "I'm getting some bloopers to 
fall in, too. It's not like I'm scorching everything." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody expected such lusty hitting from Williams, basically a hit-or-miss 
slugger in the past. He is batting .474 (27 for 57) during the 14-game binge, 
with four home runs and 20 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a lot of opportunities with guys on base," he said. "The most 
important thing to me is driving in runs."

American Laura Councilor, a first-year jockey, was in serious but stable 
condition today at Calgary Foothills Hospital where she was flown after an 
accident at the Medicine Hat Exhibition &amp; Stampede Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old rider from Phoenix suffered a fractured skull Sunday when she 
was thrown from her mount, Arms Walk Out, and kicked in the head by another 
horse as it tried to jump over her. 
</P>
<P>
"They said that her skull is fractured in two places, one on each side," said 
Councilor's husband, Don. "It could have been a lot worse, that's for sure. She 
can move her arms and legs."

THE 'BATMAN' WHO TOOK ON RAP; 
</P>
<P>
OBSCENITY: LAWYER JACK THOMPSON PUT HIS PRACTICE ON HOLD TO CONCENTRATE ON 
DRIVING 2 LIVE CREW OUT OF BUSINESS. IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA, HE IS LOVED AND 
LOATHED.

<P>
He wears a Batman watch. He drinks from a Batman mug. A large poster of the 
Caped Crusader is taped to his refrigerator door. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman is just a metaphor I use to explain why what I've done has been 
received so well by some people," says Jack Thompson, the real-life crusading 
attorney who instigated the campaign that resulted in rap group 2 Live Crew's 
"As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album being declared obscene by a federal judge. 
(See related article, Page 4.) 
</P>
<P>
"For me," says Thompson, standing in the kitchen of his modest suburban home 
here, "the appeal of the Batman lies in the fact that he was supposed to be a 
private citizen who was able to provide assistance to his government, a lone 
activist who helped authorities do a job that they seemed unable to accomplish 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, Luther Campbell isn't Luke Skyywalker (a stage name he adopted but has 
been enjoined from using by Lucasfilm), he's the Joker," Thompson says. "He's 
peddling obscenity to children and that is why I have to play Batman here -- to 
assist, to cajole and to sometimes embarrass government into doing its job." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, leader of 2 Live Crew, alleges that Thompson's crusade against him is 
a result of Thompson's bitter feelings growing out of the Coral Gables 
Republican's 1988 attempt to unseat Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno, the 
Democrat incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't realize it, but all of this started a couple of years 
ago because one of my groups put out a record in favor of Janet Reno," Campbell 
maintained in an interview at a sandwich shop around the corner from his new 
record company headquarters in Miami. "He lost the election and has been after 
me ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's 1988 campaign tactics were called into question by the Miami Herald. 
At one rally, the Herald reported, Thompson handed Reno a letter with a 
prepared statement, asking her to check the appropriate box: "I, Janet Reno, am 
a * homosexual, * bisexual, * heterosexual." The letter continued: "If you do 
not respond . . . by that date then you will be deemed to have checked one of 
the first two boxes." (Reno declined to comment.) 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Batman alter-ego Bruce Wayne, Thompson is no millionaire philanthropist. 
He is a "born-again" Christian and self-proclaimed "radical conservative 
Republican" who put his legal practice on hold 6 months ago to concentrate on 
driving Miami rap entrepreneur Campbell and his 2 Live Crew out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Following a June 6 federal district court ruling declaring the group's sexually 
explicit album obscene, the 38-year-old anti-pornography crusader has been 
vaulted into the public limelight. He's already appeared on "Crossfire," 
"Nightline," "Donahue" and "CBS This Morning," among others. 
</P>
<P>
His successful efforts to get the album declared obscene in the Southern 
Florida counties of Broward, Dade and Palm Beach have triggered a national 
debate on First Amendment rights and the future of artistic expression in pop 
music. Some have hailed him as a guardian of public morality; others have 
condemned him as a "cultural Nazi." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is loved and loathed throughout Southern Florida, depending on who you 
talk to. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Key Biscayne Presbyterian Church, where Thompson teaches Sunday 
school and attends services regularly, speak highly of him, applaud his efforts 
and clearly seem to cherish his company. 
</P>
<P>
But those in the cross-fire of his crusading activities criticize his tactics, 
distrust his motives and, on occasion, have even publicly questioned his mental 
competence. 
</P>
<P>
Luther Campbell isn't the first person to get in Thompson's anti-smut sights. 
</P>
<P>
Upset by the explicit content of programming by Neil Rogers, a popular shock 
jock on radio station WIOD-AM in Miami, Thompson complained in 1987 to the 
Federal Communications Commission, which subsequently leveled a $10,000 fine 
against the station. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Disney, the station's vice president and general manager, filed a 
complaint against Thompson the following year with the Florida Bar Assn. 
Thompson was accused of harassing WIOD-AM advertisers and Rogers. Under a 
settlement reached in November, 1989, Thompson was barred from talking about or 
coming within 500 yards of the deejay. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's feud with Rogers -- which was well publicized in Southern Florida -- 
may cost him his right to practice law, at least temporarily. On Tuesday, the 
Florida bar will hold a hearing to investigate Thompson's mental stability, 
which was challenged by WIOD attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a few major personality flaws to work out, but I am not crazy," 
Thompson says. "I have to work on tolerance a lot, anger and impatience with 
God and others. Sometimes these things get me into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Known in local Christian circles for his quick wit and feisty temperament, 
Thompson stands about 6 feet tall with piercing blue eyes and a shock of gray 
hair. An attorney who has represented a dozen sexual-abuse victims free of 
charge since 1985, he speaks with the confidence and authority of a champion 
debater -- which he was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Every week, Thompson puts his speaking talents to use hosting a Sunday school 
video seminar before about 20 adults in a classroom adjacent to the Key 
Biscayne Presbyterian Church, which Richard Nixon used to frequent during his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Throckmorton, a 35-year-old trademark lawyer who has known Thompson for 
10 years, insists his friend is misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
"People around here who only read about Jack in the papers think he must be 
like the Church Lady on 'Saturday Night Live' or something," Throckmorton says. 
"But Jack is no prude. The only think that makes Jack any different from you or 
me is that he publicly got mad about obscenity a few years ago and since then, 
he has just never backed down." 
</P>
<P>
Born July 25, 1951, in Ohio, Thompson grew up "around Cleveland," the son of 
upper-middle-class conservative Republican parents. His father was a sales 
representative for an industrial paint firm and his mother was a homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired early on by the writings of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Thompson 
says he braved death threats when he was elected student mayor of his 
3,000-student high school in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, after he campaigned for 
housing desegregation in that all-white community. 
</P>
<P>
Graduating third in a class of 800, Thompson attended college at Dennison 
University in Granville, Ohio, and law school at Vanderbilt University in 
Nashville, Tenn., where he met his wife-to-be, Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
They moved to Southern Florida in 1976, where he subsequently worked for 
Babcock Co., a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser, as a legal counsel in real estate 
acquisition. He spent a year as a fund-raiser for Logoi, a Christian ministry 
that trains pastors for service in Latin America. He also worked for the law 
firm of Blackwell Walker, from which, he acknowledged, he was fired because he 
was considered inflexible. He and Logoi president Les Thompson (no relation) 
offer different versions of his departure. 
</P>
<P>
"The board terminated Jack because he was stubborn," says Les Thompson. 
"Personally, I liked Jack's style a lot, but others felt he had personality 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
"The board of directors doesn't have the same recollection that Les Thompson 
has," Jack Thompson says. "I have nothing but the highest regard for Les 
Thompson and all he has done for the cause of Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson says he decided to get into the anti-obscenity business in 1985, after 
defending Iliana Fuster, a woman who was raped when she was 14 and whose 
husband threatened her life unless she participated with him in the sexual 
abuse of other children. 
</P>
<P>
"Her case touched my heart, because this woman's life and everyone it touched 
was shattered," Thompson says. "When I started researching the problem of 
sexual abuse, I found that one of the causes for it was obscenity, particularly 
obscenity that portrays people who are sexually abused as enjoying that abuse. 
. . . For me, that is what the disturbing component of this 2 Live Crew album 
is. . . . People are always looking for some hidden agenda for my actions, but 
this is what has motivated me. It's not a question of musical taste." 
</P>
<P>
The 1926 two-bedroom, two-bathroom stucco house Thompson has lived in with his 
wife since 1981 is furnished modestly, and includes some antique pieces he has 
restored himself. 
</P>
<P>
The Thompsons' CD and record collections include selections by Sinead O'Connor, 
Tom Petty and Frank Zappa. His bookshelf bears a copy of the Bible and 
Thompson's personal secular favorite, "Witness" by Whittaker Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on a chair in his home office, Thompson says: "People ask me all the 
time, they say, 'Aren't you leading us down the slippery slope of governmental 
control of thought?' And I say, 'No way, the guy who is leading you down that 
slope is Luther Campbell, not me.' 
</P>
<P>
"I submit the idea that there is a greater threat to freedom of expression from 
people who abuse it than those who assault it. I don't pretend to have a 
crystal ball, but if we are headed toward more thought repression in the 
government and from other sources, it's going to be because people fail to 
understand that there has to be some kind of rational limits to what citizens 
are allowed to do to each other." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson conducts his national assault against what he calls the "forces of 
evil" from this cramped office, a converted bedroom. His work station consists 
of a home computer, copier, fax machine and a speakerphone flanked by a file 
cabinet and a bookcase of legal texts. 
</P>
<P>
He says he was introduced to the lyrics of 2 Live Crew by his best friend, Mike 
Thompson (no relation), a conservative talk-show host at Miami radio station 
WNWS. Mike Thompson had received his transcription of the "Nasty" album from 
the American Family Assn., the Rev. Donald Wildmon's Tupelo, Miss.-based media 
watchdog group, in January. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon, in turn, received the lyrics from Robert DeMoss, a "youth culture 
specialist" at the Pomona-based Focus on the Family. But Thompson said he made 
up his mind long ago to distance his campaign from other anti-pornography 
forces within the Christian decency movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not affiliated with any group," Jack Thompson says. "Once you take money 
from an organization then you get tagged with all their baggage. Anyway, I 
think it is sort of in the American tradition to not necessarily be a joiner. 
With something like this, organizational entanglements are not necessarily an 
asset." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson -- whose tireless campaign has led reporters, friends and foes to not 
be surprised by relentless phone calls and faxes, some as early as 6 a.m. or as 
late as 11 p.m. -- says his anti-smut campaign is personally financed. He 
insists the success he has achieved comes from the amount of determination he 
has invested, not dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing doesn't really cost a lot to operate," he says. "It just 
takes the ability to not have to make money, and for the past six months I have 
not made any money. My wife works and is very understanding and has encouraged 
me to do this, because she realizes how bad things are getting." He would not 
specify how much his campaign has cost him. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's wife of 14 years, a trim corporate attorney who works for a large 
firm in Miami, says what Thompson does is his own business. She refuses to 
discuss anything about her husband's crusade, but listens attentively as he 
explains his cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking theoretically, I think there is a cultural civil war going on," 
Thompson says. "You've got Jesse Helms fighting against the NEA, me against 
Luther Campbell and then, of course, there is the American Family Assn. too." 
</P>
<P>
Of all the decency groups in America, Thompson says his approach is probably 
closest to that taken by the American Family Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Like Donald Wildmon, I'm kind of the foot-soldier type," he says. "I try to 
get the job done at the grass-roots level." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson seems so absorbed in his mission that he can break away repeatedly 
from a reporter's question to answer as many as a dozen phone calls in an hour 
from other reporters, and then pick up the conversation exactly where he left 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"My job is not to win these things, but as it says in Ephesians, simply to take 
a stand," he says, as if explaining his drive. "Personally, I believe the world 
is headed toward apocalyptic destruction as set forth in Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
"As a Christian I'm bound to that belief, but in the meantime, those of us who 
have been given the light through the Gospel are required to tell others that 
there is a light and to hold out hope. 
</P>
<P>
"We are required to say (there is) such a thing as right and wrong and that the 
laws ought to be enforced because God has inspired those laws and because he 
has put the world together in such a way that government exists to point people 
God-ward." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he's optimistic that he'll be able to make a difference in what he 
sees as the cultural decay of the country, he responds without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem in America is that obscenity laws are just not enforced," he says. 
"Whether it be with regard to pornographic art or adult book and video stores 
or obscene live performances, people have it in their heads that this stuff, 
because it is between consenting adults, is not harmful. 
</P>
<P>
"My own opinion is that this nation is awaking from a slumber and I predict 
that there will be more prosecutions of obscenity." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on success he has had so far in battling against the distribution of 
the 2 Live Crew album, he adds, "This case is like when Einstein said 'E=mc2.' 
First he said it and then the quantum mechanic theorists came out and said, 'We 
just exploded a bomb in Los Alamos and, guess what, Einstein's equation works.' 
With regard to 2 Live Crew and the psychological impact of the federal 
obscenity ruling in this case, the little mushroom cloud that went up in Ft. 
Lauderdale on June 6 has been seen everywhere in America."

<P>
DISSENT: EXILED STUDENT LEADER CHAI LING RISKS DEATH IF SHE FOLLOWS HER HEART 
BACK TO CHINA. NOW, SHE WANTS TO CARRY THE MESSAGE OF TIAN AN MEN SQUARE TO THE 
WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI FINKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The International House of Pancakes in Alhambra was crowded with breakfasters 
at mid-morning on a weekday. So hardly anyone looked up from their 
silver-dollar pancakes when the small, slim woman trailing a translator, a 
reporter and a photographer walked in. 
</P>
<P>
But in one corner of the restaurant, a look of shock and then joy registered on 
the faces of a middle-aged Asian couple. They rushed over to the woman, shyly 
shook her hand and asked for her autograph in the same awed way that most 
people would greet a famous politician or film star. 
</P>
<P>
While Chai Ling may not be a recognizable name or face to most Americans, she 
is a heroine to many for her role as the primary leader and pasionaria of the 
Chinese Students' Democracy Movement -- the student-led protest that riveted 
the world and riled the Chinese government one year ago this month, ending in 
the massacre of hundreds of demonstrators by army troops and riot police. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a long and painful journey for the 24-year-old Ling from Tian An Men 
Square in Beijing to this coffee shop off the San Bernardino Freeway, a journey 
filled with fear and blood, outrage and exile. 
</P>
<P>
A one-time model young Communist, she has been No. 4 on the Chinese 
government's "21 most-wanted" list of criminals ever since she gave an 
impassioned speech in the square last May that helped mobilize the support of 
the Chinese public for the student demonstrators, who elected her as their 
commander. After the government crackdown, she spent 10 months in hiding -- 
facing execution at any moment -- until she and her student leader husband, 
Feng Congde, who is also on China's most-wanted list, arrived safely in the 
West in April. 
</P>
<P>
Now living in France where the couple has received political asylum, Ling is 
winding up a five-city trip to the United States, her first. She has spoken 
with Vice President Dan Quayle, conferred with Brent Scowcroft, President 
Bush's national security adviser, addressed a rally on the steps of the U.S. 
Capitol and added to tension in Sino-American relations by urging that the Bush 
Administration link the granting of trade concessions to improvements in 
China's human-rights record. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday while Ling's plane was delayed, Asian students at Cal Tech 
patiently waited two hours past the scheduled start of her speech, which she 
delivered in Chinese. Friday night, she was guest of honor at a reception at 
the home of actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Robert Downey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Watching her wolf down a plate of French fries smothered in ketchup, her 
favorite American food, anyone would have a hard time believing Ling has seen 
and done so much. 
</P>
<P>
But when she talks about the democracy movement, her strong will makes her 
appear ageless. For this woman without a country is also a woman with a 
mission: to make sure the world never forgets those who died for freedom and 
those in her homeland who struggle for it still. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Chinese people feel terrible about what your government is doing. 
And the American people, too," says Ling, who reluctantly turns to her 
translator for help when her English fails her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to tell you a small story. Recently, I went to upstate New York and 
stayed in a small hotel. I was drinking in the bar when an American came over 
and asked if I was Chai Ling. He said he had watched TV day and night and when 
he saw what happened in Tian An Men Square, he cried. And he said he now feels 
ashamed of the American government policy towards China." 
</P>
<P>
She pauses to consider the plate of fried eggs which the waitress has just 
placed in front of her. "I don't think I can change the policy. Because it's 
not me who has ties with China. I just want to tell the world what happened in 
China that night, and why it happened, and why it continues to happen now." 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of three children, Ling was born in 1966 in the northeastern 
province of Shandong. Both her parents were members of the Communist Party, and 
she naturally joined the Central Communist Youth League, which singled her out 
as a "model student" while in high school. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until she entered Peking Normal University, where she studied child 
psychology, that Ling became politicized. In early 1987, she joined the first 
massive demonstrations for democratic reforms in nearly 40 years. And though 
her status as a college student would have guaranteed her a position among 
China's elite, she chose to risk it all by speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid at first," she admits. "Because I know that in China the minimum 
jail sentence for counterrevolutionaries is 17 years. But it wasn't my turning 
point. It was the government's turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"My generation grew up since the Cultural Revolution. And because of economic 
reform and the open door policy, we saw many things. We saw the inequality of 
the Chinese system, we saw the corruption among Chinese officials, we saw the 
censoring of the Chinese people. We saw all this, and we felt a responsibility. 
For most young people wanted to do something for their country because this 
type of patriotic feeling is a tradition among Chinese intellectuals. But the 
corruption and inequality in the system was so widespread that students felt 
hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
Like many Chinese students, she says, "I knew I had two choices. One was to 
leave the country and do my graduate work at an American school, which was the 
secure route because I knew I'd have a safe personal future. The other choice 
was to stand up and fight and join the movement. And I knew that if I did that, 
my future would likely be imprisonment." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, she says she realized there was no choice. "Because I really love 
my homeland. But most people think only of their own future, and not their 
country's." 
</P>
<P>
At first, she was merely one of many who joined the April sit-in at Tian An Man 
Square, which the students had organized to protest the government's 
indifference and delays in responding to their demand for more freedom. And she 
was among the handful who began a hunger strike. But then, on May 12, she 
decided that "I must do what I believe, which is to stand up for the Chinese 
people, to say what is right and what I believe is right." 
</P>
<P>
So she delivered an impassioned speech that became the manifesto of the hunger 
strikers, and, later, the last will and testament of the Students' Democracy 
Movement. Her words resounded with some of the same arguments that this 
country's founding fathers uttered in urging rebellion against the British. It 
was as if Betsy Ross had joined the American Revolution not as its seamstress 
but as its spokeswoman. "This nation is our nation, these people are our 
people, this government is our government," Ling told the crowd. "If we do not 
speak, who will? If we do not act, who will?" 
</P>
<P>
So pivotal was her speech that tape cassettes of it were distributed 
nationwide, and hundreds, followed by thousands, of Chinese students and 
workers began participating in the Tian An Men Square protest. 
</P>
<P>
Almost overnight, Ling was elected commander-in-chief of the Students' 
Democracy Movement even though Chinese culture traditionally keeps women in 
positions secondary to men. But, Ling recalls, she felt almost no 
discrimination. "Only a feeling of love and equality, because for many people 
this was the first time in their whole life that they shared the same feeling 
about the future of our country. So that's why it didn't matter who was 
talking, a woman or a man. It was totally new." 
</P>
<P>
And it was as their leader that she stayed in Tian An Men Square during the 
night of June 3 when the army troops and riot police advanced on the 
demonstrators. It was she who told the last 5,000 students remaining a story 
about a clan of a billion ants who had to escape a terrible fire on a mountain 
by holding onto each other and rolling down, even though the ants on the 
outside would burn to death. Then, on the morning of June 4, she led the 
remaining students out of the square and back to the university before she went 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
She describes her 10 months in hiding in China as "a very, very painful period 
when I agonized over what had happened and what I could have done differently 
to prevent it." She still has nightmares of the bodies of children. She hid in 
the homes and offices of "many strangers and organizations who still helped me 
even though they knew the punishment was immediate execution," she marvels. 
"That, more than anything, I think, shows the depth of feeling in China about 
our revolution." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some "really heroic figures" in the French government helped her gain 
asylum in that country. Because she is an "enemy of the state," she cannot get 
word to her family still in China with whom she has not spoken since the early 
days of the student protests. When her name appeared on a list of hunger 
strikers, her father tried to get a message to her, she says, but she was never 
able to answer him. Recently, when a French photographer taking her picture 
told her of the Western custom of Mother's Day, she broke down and wept. 
</P>
<P>
She is sobbing even now. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my father and mother very deeply," she explains, haltingly. "I feel 
sorry that at the moment I cannot fulfill my responsibility towards my parents. 
But as a Chinese, I feel I need to do what is right for the Chinese people. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to be here eating pancakes when my thoughts are back in 
China," she says, glancing around at the breakfasters who, concentrating on 
their food, seem oblivious to her emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"The demonstrations by the students are still going on. No matter how much 
pressure is put on them by the government, it will continue. Maybe even 
stronger."

<TEXT>
<P>
Campaigning for reelection two years ago, U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini fired an 
M-16 assault rifle for the first time. He liked it. 
</P>
<P>
And if his public duties didn't saddle him with mind-numbing three-day trips to 
Estonia and other time-crunchers, DeConcini says he would once more go hunting 
deer and javelina, a type of wild pig. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the 53-year-old Democrat from Tucson seems to fit right in to 
the Arizona landscape, just the way Wyatt Earp once did. 
</P>
<P>
But for some of his constituents and former supporters, DeConcini has strayed 
"off the reservation," as one opponent put it. For them, he is a renegade, a 
betrayer of traditions and rights that stretch even further back than the 
gun-slinging days of the Wild West. By proposing a ban on 14 military-style 
semiautomatic firearms -- like the one used in last year's Stockton school 
massacre -- they believe DeConcini, a conservative in a conservative state, 
joined a dangerous cabal of liberals bent on restricting the right to bear 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, NRA members picketed DeConcini's Phoenix office. Others made 
"nasty" phone calls and "some threats," the senator says. A few mounted a 
petition drive to recall DeConcini. It failed, falling more than 100,000 
signatures short of the number needed to force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
That's not the only flank the low-key politician must worry about. The former 
prosecutor and son of an Arizona state Supreme Court judge is one of the 
"Keating Five," the group of senators under investigation by the Senate Ethics 
Committee for allegedly interfering with federal regulators on behalf of the 
failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. As a result, in one state poll 
DeConcini's dissatisfaction rating rose from 29% to 41% in a three-month 
period. He has vehemently maintained that he did no wrong in the Keating 
affair, one of several ethical scandals that have swept through Congress 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the Keating affair has been a serious political blow, 
DeConcini portrays the vote on his gun ban as an example of the Senate standing 
up to a special-interest group. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no stronger special interest than the NRA and here were guys who said 
no," he declares. "They took money from them, they'd been lobbied and they said 
no." 
</P>
<P>
After a $190,000 media campaign late last year and other damage-control 
tactics, DeConcini, an independently wealthy lawyer with extensive real estate 
holdings, may be bouncing back. An April poll showed that his ratings had 
"stabilized and started to move up" with a majority of voters giving DeConcini 
an excellent to fair rating, says aide Michael Crusa. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest advantage, however, may simply be time. DeConcini doesn't have to 
run for reelection until 1994 and he says he won't decide whether to make the 
race for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
But Earl de Berge, research director of the Phoenix polling organization that 
took both the January and April surveys, notes that political circles in the 
state already are buzzing with talk of possible challengers to DeConcini in 
1994. These rumblings are likely to remain muffled for a while. "I think 
everyone is waiting to see what the ethics committee does," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
De Berge also notes that the state's other senator, Republican John McCain, has 
also been enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal, perhaps making both 
politicians vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the latest improvement, DeConcini's numbers are "not a pretty 
picture" because of his still-high negative rating of 24%, de Berge says. Yet 
in a "routine" election, DeConcini probably would still be electable, despite 
the Keating affair, de Berge adds. 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini's assault-rifle ban, first proposed last year, passed the Senate late 
last month, albeit by one vote, 50-49. 
</P>
<P>
Although the future of DeConcini's measure -- part of a larger anti-crime bill 
that has been held up by parliamentary maneuvering -- is uncertain, the victory 
remains a moment to savor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been there for almost 14 years and (the NRA has) never been rolled once 
on the floor (of the Senate)," he says. "That's the first time they've ever 
been beaten on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
But for the National Rifle Assn., the once unbeatable pro-gun lobby, it was a 
sort of Custer's Last Stand, perhaps the most stunning in a series of recent 
defeats on both state and federal levels, including an assault rifle ban in 
California. Moreover, the NRA had once named DeConcini its legislator of the 
month for his unswerving support of the gun lobby. It also had endorsed him in 
his election bids and given him campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, something happened. But what? Was it a total political 
transformation, as the headlines might suggest? Or was it a case of a 
politician who ultimately discovered he couldn't have it both ways -- and opted 
for the risky road anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Reliving his unexpected victory the other day, DeConcini plumped firmly for the 
latter, portraying himself as a man who broke reluctantly with former 
supporters and with his own long-held principles to advocate a limited gun ban. 
</P>
<P>
Before he introduced Senate Bill 747 he had been "with the NRA on every damn 
issue they've ever had," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The senator is slouched in a chair of his resort hotel room, speaking 
dispassionately about an issue that has added to his already ample political 
troubles. This morning DeConcini seems utterly unflappable. That may have 
something to do with the fact that he and his wife Susan are celebrating the 
birth of their first grandchild. Later in the day, the DeConcinis plan to see 
the baby for the first time. When the senator mentions the savings and loan 
scandal or his new enemies in the gun lobby, he often chuckles and shakes his 
head as if bemused by the tortuous paths of politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't just wake up one morning and say, 'Oh, I think I'll do something to 
tick off the NRA,' " he says. "I thought about it very clearly and I knew what 
I was getting into." 
</P>
<P>
While polls have found that 64% of Arizonans support his gun ban, DeConcini 
suspects that the long-term political fallout may hurt him. "I know the gun 
lobbyists and I know the NRA members here," he explains. "They are single-issue 
people. They're active and they're not going to forget about this, whereas the 
people who like what I did are going to forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
This sentiment is echoed by NRA lobbyist David Conover who notes that the 
50,000 association members in Arizona "are active and relatively hard-line" in 
their opposition to nearly all gun controls. "It's a tough state to be in favor 
of gun regulation," Conover says. While the NRA may work with DeConcini in the 
future, the group is unlikely to ever support him for reelection or turn to him 
for help, the lobbyist says. "All those things are going to be different now." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the NRA "feel I've betrayed them," DeConcini concedes, even though he 
maintains that his measure was a compromise, conceived partly as an alternative 
to harsher restrictive measures by more liberal senators. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, DeConcini says he sought to avoid a full-blown split with the NRA, 
negotiating with the group's lobbyists to find common ground on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Stockton school killings last year, in which drifter James 
Purdy -- armed with an AK-47 assault rifle -- killed five children and wounded 
29 others and a teacher, DeConcini recalls that the NRA came to him for help in 
fighting back calls for a national assault rifle ban. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they were talking to all the members they had who were pro-NRA or pro 
the Second Amendment position," he says, referring to the Bill of Rights 
provision regarding firearms. DeConcini says he rebuffed the approach, 
stressing that his views were shaped by the extensive use of assault weapons by 
drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s DeConcini, then Pima County prosecutor, was tapped to lead a 
statewide law enforcement drive against drugs, the beginning of his public 
affiliation with anti-drug efforts. In the early '80s, he was under 24-hour 
guard for a time because of a death threat he received after he "fingered" a 
Bolivian government minister who was mixed up in the drug trade. In the Senate 
he has introduced a number of bills to turn up the heat on drug dealers and has 
chaired the Senate Drug Enforcement Caucus. DeConcini also was asked by 
President Bush to become the country's first "drug czar." 
</P>
<P>
From this perspective, DeConcini says he gradually came to believe that assault 
weapons in the hands of drug dealers were too dangerous to remain on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the things that weighed on my mind to say I think it's time that we 
try something, notwithstanding my own philosophy toward non-restriction of guns 
and knowing who I was taking on," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the best of all possible worlds, he believes that "any gun restriction 
should be at the state level or local level." 
</P>
<P>
Expanding on this credo, DeConcini suddenly begins to sound like a true son of 
the West. He does not want "a bureaucracy like the FBI or the Treasury 
Department, non-elected people, being able to determine whether you have the 
right to have a gun," he says emphatically. "And that includes semiautomatic 
rifles because I think that this is an invitation for someone to see your name 
there and say, 'Oh I know (him). I remember that son of a gun. Well, I'm going 
to go check his financial background.' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, DeConcini says he revised his gun-ban measure because the NRA objected 
to a provision that called for registration of semiautomatic versions of 
military rifles with the Treasury Department. He also limited the ban to three 
years because the NRA argued against a flat ban, the senator says. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, however, his patience and desire to keep fences mended wore out 
like an old pair of boots. "I got to the point where I got a little frustrated 
with them because they didn't want to negotiate at all," he says. "All they 
wanted was to chop it away." 
</P>
<P>
His last meetings with gun owners were as acrid as powder smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally got upset and then some of them threatened me with a recall in one 
of the last meetings I had with them here," he recalls. "I said, 'Hey, I can't 
deal with you if that's how you're going to deal . . . I'm not here to deal 
under intimidation . . . You're beating up on me and threatening recall and I 
don't appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini still is miffed by the NRA's tactics early on in the battle against 
his gun ban, although the national group did not officially back the recall 
attempt. He was particularly incensed by the "blatant lie" that his bill would 
ban "your standard 12-gauge shotgun." Eventually, the NRA backed off, agreeing 
to "stop sending mail into your state condemning you by name," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In this rancorous atmosphere, DeConcini was uncertain that his measure stood 
even the whiff of a chance when it came up for the May 23 vote. But he was 
convinced that he was closer than his opponents would ever guess. 
</P>
<P>
He credits the last-minute support of Republican John Warner of Virginia and 
Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for the bill's passage. 
</P>
<P>
And his account of Warner's and Bentsen's votes throws light on politics 
between senators: 
</P>
<P>
"I had no necessary clout with Warner. I know him well and know he likes me, 
but I couldn't go to him and say, 'You know, John, what can I do to help your 
campaign or something' and say, 'Gee, will you help me?' . . . Bentsen is 
another one. . . . Here he is, chairman of the finance committee . . . I don't 
have anything that he wants necessarily. We're good friends. We socialize. . . 
. He knew I wanted the bill but I couldn't say, 'I really need this. After all, 
I've done this for you.' There was nothing there. And he just walked in on his 
own, came up to me and said to me, 'You know you're damn right. You've got a 
lot of guts and I really admire what you're doing and I'm going to vote with 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Observers of DeConcini's career are well aware that the gun bill is not the 
first time the senator has shown a capacity for surprising behavior. Three 
years ago, he cast a key vote against the nomination of Robert Bork to the 
Supreme Court, a stand that irked those who saw support of Bork as a litmus 
test of true allegiance to conservatism. In his first term, DeConcini backed 
the Panama Canal Treaty, anathema to many conservatives, after gaining 
concessions from the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini says he has grown used to being depicted "as a cautious, careful guy 
that often stays on the fence until the last minute and then, when I do 
something like Bork or the Panama Canal or (the gun control bill), they say, 
'Oh my God, what's he doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
Such reactions, he says, stem from a misreading of his character. "My way of 
operating is I don't make quick decisions," he explains. "I try to get the 
information and, sure, I'm subject to political pressure, but I try to think it 
out and get a lot of information before I make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his current problems, DeConcini says he continues to like being in the 
Senate. But he quickly adds, "I've got an ego and satisfaction that I want out 
of it. But I don't have to have it. I never had to have it financially. I do it 
because I was raised that way -- do it out of a sense of wanting to 
participate. I'm as political probably as anybody but I don't make my decisions 
based on what am I going to be elected next time?" 
</P>
<P>
He also says passage of the gun bill should muffle critics who argue he has 
lost clout in the Senate because of the savings and loan controversy. 
</P>
<P>
But later, when asked, DeConcini returns almost eagerly to the potential 
pleasures awaiting him outside politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a lot of options," he says. "I'm a native son here. My family's been 
in the real estate business a long time. I own real estate, I like developing 
real estate. I like practicing law. . . . So, I've got a lot to do. And, you 
know, I think about that. I think about it with great joy sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be in La Jolla now. I have a home in La Jolla and I used to have a 
boat and probably when I -- not retire -- but when I get out of public life, 
I'll spend some time in La Jolla and maybe buy a boat." 
</P>
<P>
Is he at peace with himself? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, that's one thing I am," he replies. He adds that his personal code 
helps him maintain inner calm: "Do what you think is right and be honest with 
yourself and your God and your family and things will be OK, even in tough 
times when the ethics committee is looking at you." 
</P>
<P>
Then he laughs quietly.
