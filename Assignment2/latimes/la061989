San Jose police searched for a gunman who killed a 16-year-old Japanese 
exchange student. Ai Toyoshima, who arrived in this country just two months 
ago, died from a gunshot wound to the chest by an unidentified assailant. The 
wounded girl was found by a passer-by in a field behind an elementary school. 
Barely alive, Toyoshima was taken to a hospital, where before she died, she 
described her assailant to a police officer who speaks Japanese. She died at 6 
a.m.

Scientists have for the first time found high levels of ozone and acid rain 
over thousands of miles of virgin rain forests of Central Africa, the New York 
Times said in a report from Freiburg, West Germany. It said the discovery by 
separate teams of scientists from France and West Germany was particularly 
alarming because the pollution exists throughout the year and is comparable to 
levels found in industrialized Europe and North America. The scientists said 
the pollution is largely caused by fires set by farmers and herdsmen to clear 
shrubs and to stimulate the growth of crops and grass.

Sudan's armed forces claimed to have uncovered a plot by army officers and 
civilians to topple the government and return former President Jaafar Numeiri 
to power. State radio did not say how many were involved or how they planned to 
overthrow the elected government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi. Meanwhile, 
2,000 people calling for a return to military rule demonstrated in central 
Khartoum, the capital. Sudanese authorities said last December that they had 
foiled a coup attempt by ex-army officers and civilians who had served under 
Numeiri, who has lived in Egypt since being ousted in a 1985 coup.

Several senior members of the South-West Africa People's Organization who 
fought a guerrilla war for independence for more than two decades returned from 
exile to lead the organization in U.N.-supervised independence elections for 
Namibia in November. Kissing the tarmac after stepping from the plane carrying 
100 returnees, SWAPO Politburo member Hage Geingob said it was "a dream come 
true after 27 years." The returning exiles include a number of senior members 
of SWAPO, including Information Secretary Hidipo Hamutenya and Foreign Affairs 
Secretary Theo Ben-Gurirab. The date for the return of SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma 
has not been announced.

South Korean patrol boats rescued 78 Vietnamese refugees who set their boat on 
fire and jumped into the sea after they were refused permission to land, the 
South Korean news agency Yonhap said. The patrol boats were escorting the 
refugee vessel out to international waters when the 30-ton boat suddenly burst 
into flames and sank off the southern island of Cheju, Yonhap quoted naval 
police as saying. It was not immediately clear whether the Seoul government 
would allow the "boat people" to settle in South Korea.

An Israeli army officer in the occupied Gaza Strip was shot and wounded when an 
Arab gunman opened fire from a passing car. An Arab newspaper vendor was killed 
in the gunfire, an army spokesman said. The attack marked a rare use of 
firearms against the Israeli army in the 18-month-old Arab uprising. In the 
West Bank, Israeli troops shot and killed two Arab youths in separate 
incidents, and an Israeli from the settlement of Ariel was found stabbed to 
death. The Israeli Cabinet, meanwhile, outlawed three fundamentalist Muslim 
groups -- the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hezbollah (Party of God) and Islamic

NEWSMAKERS: IN D.C. STATEHOOD QUEST, JACKSON INVOKES HIGHER LAW

 -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson reached for the teachings of the Bible in his call 
for statehood for the District of Columbia. In a packed church Sunday in 
Washington, the former presidential candidate and civil rights leader said the 
city, which has a population of 360,000, deserves "emancipation and 
empowerment." Although avoiding any mention of reports that he is considering a 
run for mayor, Jackson compared the drive for statehood to Moses' struggle to 
free the Israelites and the emancipation from slavery of blacks. "We should be 
praying, God give us statehood, God give us self-determination," he said. 
Although Rep. Walter E. Fauntroy represents the capital in Congress, he has no 
vote. "In every Western democracy, people in the capital city have voting 
representation in the national Legislature," Jackson said after his speech. 
Jackson has said that he will move to Washington but that he has made no 
decision on a mayoral bid.

 -- JoAnn Pepper has announced that she will seek the House seat left vacant by 
the death of her uncle, Rep. Claude Pepper of Florida. But if she succeeds in 
winning the state Democratic Party's nod, there's another uncle who doesn't 
plan to vote for her. Frank Pepper, the sole surviving brother of Congress' 
leading elderly-rights advocate, said: "At no time was I ever consulted about 
her plans, and it appears she has been talked into something about which she 
knows very little." JoAnn Pepper, 38, the adopted daughter of Pepper's 
sister-in-law, is a federal probation officer in Miami and has never run for 
public office. Pepper was 88 when he died last month.

 -- Three Soviet recovering alcoholics spent their remaining moments in America 
in Plains, Ga., attending a religious class taught at the Marantha Baptist 
Church by former President Jimmy Carter. Sasha, Victor and Volodya -- their 
last names are not used because of an Alcoholics Anonymous tradition -- have 
completed a two-month tour of the United States, attending A. A. meetings, 
visiting alcohol treatment centers and meeting at the White House with Dr. 
Burton Lee, President Bush's personal physician. They are members of "Moscow 
Beginners," the first A. A. unit in the Soviet Union. JAMES MARNELL

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: RECRUITS GET LIFESAVER IN SINK-OR-SWIM BOOT CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounds corny, but young men and women still join the Navy to see the world. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some never see anything more than boot camp and are back on a 
homeward-bound bus after a few frustrating weeks. It costs the Navy time and 
money, and leaves the failed recruit with a lifetime of explanations. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 21% of the 25,292 recruits at the Navy boot camp in San Diego washed 
out. Similar rates also plagued the Navy's other two boot camps, in Great 
Lakes, Ill., and Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman says the attrition rate is "unacceptably high in today's tough 
recruiting market and shrinking manpower pool." It's a stubborn problem that 
has defied numerous remedies. 
</P>
<P>
The latest attempt is a three-month experiment under way at all three camps, in 
which there will be no "drops" during the first 
</P>
<P>
three weeks of the 8 1/2-week training course. Studies show that 85% of the 
washouts fail in the first three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
No more. Foundering recruits are to be targeted for counseling and additional 
attention to provide "added motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Two skills are particularly troublesome: swimming and reading. Remedial 
instruction has been strengthened in both. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors who still cannot swim after boot camp will be assigned to shore duty 
while undergoing further swimming instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of fine young sailors from Kansas and Iowa who've never seen 
water until they hit San Diego," said a Navy spokesman. "We want to give them 
every chance to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the new buckle-down policy, the Navy is also trying a sweetener to 
encourage recruits to tough it out. A fringe benefit phased out in 1979 to save 
money has been reinstituted: a 15-day leave for all recruits who complete boot 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Fans, Cool Cod 
</P>
<P>
Short shots: 
</P>
<P>
It's a good thing that the Padres' Jack Clark has shown signs of emerging from 
his batting slump. The fans were getting hostile. 
</P>
<P>
Last week a group down the third base line held up eye charts every time Clark 
came to bat. 
</P>
<P>
And when a fan spotted an ambulance outside the stadium, he yelled, "Hey, are 
Clark's bats in there? They need some emergency treatment." He wasn't joking. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Greenpeace. The San Diego school system is buying 30,000 pounds of 
Icelandic cod fillet for $56,700. The environmental group had asked that no 
Icelandic cod be bought for school cafeterias to protest Iceland's allowance of 
whale hunting. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Tom Payzant decided to go ahead with the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
His reasons: Iceland has promised to rethink its whaling practices, Icelandic 
cod is cheaper than Canadian cod, and Icelandic cod doesn't have "as fishy a 
taste." 
</P>
<P>
Go Ahead and Sue 
</P>
<P>
Update: First the judges called the Leonard-Hearns fight a draw. Now the city 
attorney has rendered a verdict in Wolfsheimer-Dickey: Wolfsheimer on a split 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Alan F. Dickey, chairman of the Rancho de Los Penasquitos Planning Board, had 
protested that Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer violated the Brown Act by 
strong-arming him into turning off his tape recorder at a meeting of a citizens 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy City Atty. Ted Bromfield says no violation took place because the 
committee was not formed by the City Council and thus is not subject to the 
Brown Act. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the committee does not fit what the council had in mind when 
it decided that a citizens committee should provide recommendations on spending 
$2.2 million in developer fees in Rancho Penasquitos. Wolfsheimer merely formed 
a committee and installed herself as chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Bromfield's decision throws the committee matter back to the council. Other 
council members may have their own ideas on who should be on the committee and 
how it should be run. 
</P>
<P>
Bromfield writes that, should Dickey disagree with his decision, "he is free to 
challenge further action by mandamus," which to you and me is a lawsuit. Dickey 
says he's busy making a living and can't afford a mandamus.

'SHOW ME STATE' READY TO SHOW OFF BILL STACY; 
</P>
<P>
MISSOURI MORE THAN CONFIDENT ABOUT SAN MARCOS PICK

<TEXT>
<P>
The folks who live along this elbow of the Mississippi River don't understand 
all the skepticism and hesitation out in California over Bill Stacy, who was 
selected last week as founding president for the new state university in San 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
They've heard the stories from San Diego County that Stacy wasn't the first 
choice among the students, faculty, staff and community leaders involved in the 
search for the new California State University president. And that's insulting 
to this town, home of the wooded, 116-year-old Southeast Missouri State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy is their Cinderella story, the local boy who made good. Stacy got his 
bachelor's degree here in 1960. He returned as a speech professor in 1967. He 
became a dean. For the past 10 years he has been president. And now, after 
having spent 26 of his 50 years in this town, Stacy's heading west, and, while 
residents say they're happy for him, they also don't want to lose him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Money-Back Guarantee 
</P>
<P>
One faculty member offers this money-back guarantee to his cynical counterparts 
in San Marcos: 
</P>
<P>
If you don't like Stacy after a year, send him back home and we'll reimburse 
you his first year's salary. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Stacy commands awe and respect in this town is an understatement. 
The only debate about him here is whether he can walk on water. 
</P>
<P>
* A former mayor who worked with Stacy in the construction of a joint 
campus-city, $15-million sports and performing arts complex, called the Show Me 
Center, says Stacy's the kind of fellow who works the hardest behind the scenes 
to accomplish something, then gives the credit to others. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bill Stacy has a weakness, I don't know what it is," said Howard Tooke, 
mayor here from 1970 until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
* Faculty members say Stacy encourages professors to follow their intellectual 
instincts in developing new programs, and asks what he can do to help. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never told me what to do in the classroom -- as long as I did what was 
best for the students and I did it right," said Ed Leoni, who was president of 
the academic senate this past school year. "He has an insatiable appetite to 
develop and to progress within reason. We haven't floundered. We haven't taken 
any dead ends. It's been growth with a purpose and a mission. I don't know if 
it's right for us to be this happy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Executive Trappings 
</P>
<P>
* Students say Stacy is an approachable administrator who doesn't surround 
himself with any of the trappings of a university executive. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just the sweetest person. I adore him," said 21-year-old senior Cheryl 
Sebaugh, who got to know Stacy personally because of her scholastic 
achievements on this campus of 9,000 students. "His door's always open if you 
have any problems. And he's always got hugs for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
* Administrators and staff members say Stacy is uncanny in working with 
committees in developing a consensus and a plan of action embraced by everyone. 
He's such an effective mediator, he was asked to referee a longstanding grudge 
between local labor union leaders and management in the region's construction 
trade. As if in tribute to Stacy, the Show Me Center was finished in time and 
under budget. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got great respect from politicians and the community," said Leslie 
Cochran, the university's provost. "He finds the middle ground and pulls people 
together into alliances." 
</P>
<P>
* Community and business leaders credit Stacy for sensitizing this region -- 
where the economy is defined in terms of corn and soybeans, barge repair and 
the manufacture of Florsheim shoes, Kitty Litter and Pampers -- to the impact 
of the Pacific Rim economy. He recruited Japanese and Chinese students to his 
campus and then, on a visit to Tokyo, where he was establishing an overseas 
program for students and faculty from his campus, he paved the way for a 
Japanese firm to relocate here as well. Two others later followed suit. No 
wonder that Stacy spent a year as president of the local Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a golden-tongued salesman -- with brains," said Bill Edwards, a local 
retail businessman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Buildings 
</P>
<P>
* State legislators joke that if Stacy continued to win funding for new 
</P>
<P>
buildings on his campus, it would sink into the Mississippi under the weight of 
all that concrete. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't spend much time talking to him at the Capitol because all the other 
legislators want to talk to him, too," said Mary Kasten, a state assemblywoman 
whose district includes this city of 38,000. "It seemed like nobody could 
resist Bill Stacy." 
</P>
<P>
* Fellow university administrators in the state tip their hat to Stacy, who is 
president of Missourians for Higher Education, a consortium of private and 
public universities and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"He is considered an educational statesman in our state," said Dr. Bill 
Danforth, chancellor of the private and prestigious University of Washington in 
St. Louis, 120 miles north of here. "He's bright, articulate, sensitive, wise 
and balanced." 
</P>
<P>
* People with money are fans of Stacy -- and put their money where their mouths 
are. Stacy formed the University Foundation six years ago, and it has since 
raised $15 million for the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"We admire Bill and his university," said Harry Crisp, who owns the Pepsi Cola 
Bottling Co. serving a five-state region. "He's not a fund-raiser per se. But 
he's such a sincere and outstanding leader, you want to work with him." So 
Crisp and his wife, Rosemary, gave the university a $3-million building in the 
so-called Boot Heel, the southeastern corner of the state, for a satellite 
campus, and gave more than $100,000 in cash for campus development here. 
</P>
<P>
Added Tom Wood, a St. Louis publishing executive and chairman of the University 
Foundation: "Bill's a master at nurturing people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even the Press Likes Him 
</P>
<P>
* Even the region's daily newspaper, where reporters might provide some 
cynicism about the town's biggest news maker, was singing Stacy's praises in a 
farewell editorial Thursday. It read, in part: 
</P>
<P>
"What Cape Girardeau will miss when Bill Stacy departs is a gracious man who 
moved easily between academicians and the less educated, who gave of his time 
at student recitals and Boy Scout meetings and who took as much pride in the 
community as he did in his university, knowing one could not succeed without 
the other. He is nothing short of a class act." 
</P>
<P>
What develops from these snapshots, then, is a portrait of a man who won't be 
damned in San Marcos for what unwanted baggage he'll bring with him, but who 
will need an entire river barge to carry his accolades and kudos. His 
associates say Stacy would rather start fresh in San Marcos as a relative 
unknown and build his own reputation from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his string of successes here, those who know Stacy best say they are 
not surprised he is leaving. There is, indisputably, the challenge of building 
a university from scratch. Furthermore, Stacy's longtime marriage to his first 
wife, Jane -- they have three grown children -- ended in divorce about two 
years ago. His former wife still works on campus as the alumni director, and 
about a year ago Stacy began courting a business professor on campus. The two 
married a week ago, just prior to his appointment to the San Marcos job, and 
friends say the move to San Marcos offers Stacy the chance to start both his 
professional and personal lives anew. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy's biggest initial challenge will be in demonstrating the mettle and 
strength that is belied by his casual, easy-going nature, his associates say. 
Indeed, Stacy's initial detractors in San Marcos during the presidential search 
process said they feared Stacy might be little more than a slick speaker 
without substance. 
</P>
<P>
"There's plenty of steel and presidential timber behind that facade," said Art 
Walhausen, Stacy's assistant on campus here. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wood: "You don't get by without substance for 10 years as a university 
president and still get to leave like he does, on top." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Like a Midwesterner 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Estes, who runs a string of service stations in these parts, is Stacy's 
golf partner and arguably his best friend. "The job of an administrator is to 
communicate, and Bill's the best communicator you ever knew," he said. Told of 
the criticism that Stacy struck some people as a bit too casual to be 
presidential, Estes answered: "People from the Midwest affect everybody that 
way. What you see is what you get with Bill. There's nothing phony about him." 
</P>
<P>
Under Stacy's leadership, old buildings on campus have been renovated and new 
ones built. Faculty salaries have increased. A prized collection of William 
Faulkner works -- including some unpublished pieces -- was donated to the 
university library. The number of campus administrators was decreased. The 
university, founded as a teaching school, is now the single largest supplier of 
computer technicians to McDonnell-Douglas Corp. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy is most lauded for his work in five areas -- politics, community support, 
affirmative action, support for the faculty, and curriculum innovations -- and 
they suggest he is a man for all seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Ever present, say those who know and work with him, is his skill as a 
communicator, facilitator and consensus maker. 
</P>
<P>
He has successfully lobbied in the state Capitol on behalf of higher education 
in general and his own campus specifically. Missouri's public higher education 
system is anchored by the University of Missouri in Columbia. In its shadow are 
Southeast University and its four other sister campuses representing other 
parts of the state. They are governed autonomously by their respective boards 
of regents, and while there is a committee to coordinate the financing of all 
six campuses, each must lobby specifically for its own peculiar needs. Stacy 
has championed the needs of all universities and has excelled in winning 
specific support for his own campus, legislators say. 
</P>
<P>
(Stacy's political savvy stems in part from his familiarity with state 
politicians. The brother-in-law of his first wife was Warren Hearns, a two-term 
governor of Missouri during the 1960s.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show Me Center Saga 
</P>
<P>
Stacy won both state and city support for the construction of the Show Me 
Center on campus -- a multipurpose building that has featured the likes of 
President Reagan, Bob Hope and Tina Turner, as well as tractor pulls, 
professional wrestling, circuses and basketball tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
First, Stacy lobbied state legislators to give the campus $7 million toward the 
construction of the center, out of state bonds approved for capital 
improvements statewide. Once that was done, he enlisted civic support and 
campaigned successfully for a citywide bond issue that contributed an 
additional $5 million to the project, financed by a property tax increase and a 
hotel and restaurant tax. Finally, the university contributed $3 million of its 
own toward the construction of an adjoining student recreation center complex 
featuring such things as indoor track, basketball courts, weight rooms, 
exercise equipment and racquetball courts. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Show Me Center two years ago created perhaps the 
biggest controversy Stacy has had to deal with: a debate on whether it should 
be constructed on the campus or several miles away, alongside an interestate 
highway on property that would have been donated by a regional motel developer 
and would have brought the city greater public exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy wanted it built on campus and prevailed, having argued that the facility 
was primarily for the students' use and should be close to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I think it would have been great along the interstate because of the 
exposure it would have gotten there," said former Mayor Tooke. "But Bill was 
right. It belonged on campus." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ken Newton, editor of the Southeast Missourian newspaper, "The way he got 
the state and city to work together for that center on campus was a real piece 
of work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affirmative Action 
</P>
<P>
In areas of affirmative action, Stacy has surpassed federal mandates for his 
campus. When blacks made up 3.3% of the campus enrollment, he was told to bring 
the figure closer to 5% to reflect the region's ethnic balance. Today, 8% of 
the student body is black; last fall, 10% of the incoming freshmen were black. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the number of black professors on campus increased from four to 18 
after Stacy offered his deans this interesting offer: If you can recruit 
qualified black instructors, I'll hire them as new professors over and above 
your already-budgeted positions. Today, officials say, Southeast Missouri has 
more black professors than the University of Missouri itself. 
</P>
<P>
Instructors on campus credit Stacy for having injected a sense of excitement 
into the curriculum by challenging the faculty to look beyond the tried and 
proven. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for instance, this anecdote from Grace Hoover, who has served as a 
nutrition instructor on campus since 1962: 
</P>
<P>
"I proposed to Bill in 1979 that we sponsor a day-care center for the elderly. 
There was nothing else like it on campus. He supported me on it. It was risky 
and it could have fallen flat, but he was open to the idea. A lot of presidents 
might have said, 'Well, we'll do a needs assessment and see if we can get the 
funding and then we'll consider it.' But Bill is receptive to creative, 
innovative ideas. After he told me I could pursue it, he went out and helped me 
get the money to fund it." 
</P>
<P>
Stacy's most far-reaching contribution to the campus curriculum was the 
restructuring of the university's general education program. Five years in the 
planning, the so-called University Studies Program now calls for each student 
to take two years of general, liberal education before more specifically 
pursuing his major area of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Courses during the first two years share nine objectives, ranging from the 
development of communication and critical-thinking skills to an appreciation 
for aesthetics and responsible interaction with one's natural, social and 
political environment. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching, told the university in an address here last fall: 
</P>
<P>
"This program . . . is, in my opinion, the most creative, most coherent, most 
thought-provoking undergraduate sequence in the United States."

MINISTER SEEKS TO SILENCE CLASS' READING OF PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bothered by the casual profanity in the play being read aloud by her Escondido 
high school English class last month, a 17-year-old senior mentioned her 
concerns to her father and asked for his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
As her father, a minister, glanced through the play's opening act, he said that 
he "found myself becoming as offended, if not more so, as my daughter had 
been." 
</P>
<P>
"There were frequent vulgarities and profanities, and God's name was constantly 
being used in vain," said the Rev. Billy Falling, the founder and head of the 
Escondido-based Christian Voters League, a fundamentalist religious-political 
group. "We don't use that kind of language in our home and my daughter 
certainly doesn't use it, either. It struck me that this was a totally 
inappropriate book to be read aloud in class." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unimpressed by Praise 
</P>
<P>
The play in question was Arthur Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Death of a 
Salesman." Clearly unimpressed by the literary accolades accorded the play 
during the past 40 years, Falling has seized upon the recent episode at Orange 
Glen High School, hoping to use it to launch a crusade aimed at preventing 
Miller's work and conceivably many others from being read aloud in local 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, Falling and his followers will ask the Escondido Union High School 
District Board of Education to adopt a policy stating: "No student shall be 
asked to read aloud in class materials that use God's name in vain, profanity 
or vulgarities. Neither shall teachers or administrators use God's name in 
vain, or use speech using vulgarities or profanities . . . before the students 
of this district." 
</P>
<P>
With CVL members circulating petitions in support of the proposal, Falling said 
he hopes to present thousands of signatures to the school board at its June 28 
meeting to demonstrate that "there's a tidal wave of emotion out there on this 
issue." If the board rejects the measure, Falling warns, he may mount a recall 
campaign against its members. 
</P>
<P>
That prediction and related warning, however, may prove to be as hyperbolic as 
some of Falling's goals for the CVL itself. Established 4 1/2 years ago, the 
CVL was envisioned by Falling as a Moral Majority-type movement to transform 
American politics by refocusing attention on "traditional values," a scenario 
based on forecasts that the group would swell to hundreds of chapters and 1 
million members nationwide by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, there are only 11 CVL chapters in California -- four of them in 
northern San Diego County -- with a total of about 1,100 members. Said Falling: 
"Our plans to go national have been pushed back a bit." 
</P>
<P>
With that less than meteoric rise as a backdrop, some observers have suggested 
that Falling perhaps hopes to capitalize on the present controversy to spur the 
CVL's growth -- an allegation that causes the former Assemblies of God pastor 
to bristle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acting as a Parent 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not doing this as a CVL officer -- I'm doing it as a parent," said the 
49-year-old Falling, an imposing, husky 6-footer with thick, dark hair. "But 
one reason there is a CVL is so we don't have to reinvent the wheel every time 
an issue like this comes along. It gives us an effective method to have our 
voice heard." 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to public perceptions, Falling emphasizes that he is not seeking to 
ban any books from classrooms, but rather only to prevent ones that include 
profanity from being read aloud by students. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a bunch of book-burning censors with a list of books we're trying to 
get off the shelves," Falling explained. "People have a right to read what they 
want. But they shouldn't be forced to read aloud something that offends them or 
is contrary to their beliefs. The issue here isn't book titles or censorship. 
It's profanity." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, view the distinction between a classroom prohibition on 
reading books aloud and an outright ban to be a rather thin one. Adoption of 
the former, they argue, represents a step toward the latter. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly opens the door to the censorship issue," said Dan McLeod, 
chairman of San Diego State University's English department. Falling's "idea 
may seem innocent enough, but it could lead to much more serious and 
distasteful things better left alone." 
</P>
<P>
Falling's proposed restriction, Orange Glen Principal Ed Brand added, would 
"seriously undermine a book's effectiveness and take away a valuable teaching 
tool." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreed With Daughter 
</P>
<P>
"Many teachers believe that reading aloud is critical to improved 
comprehension, to improving reading skills and that it helps to make classes 
more lively," Brand said. "It really would tie teachers' hands." 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido controversy was spawned by the discomfort that Falling's daughter 
Becky felt when "Death of a Salesman" was read aloud by students in her 
12th-grade English class last month. 
</P>
<P>
After his daughter mentioned the incident to him, Falling read a portion of the 
play's opening act and quickly seconded his daughter's reaction to the 
expletives sprinkled throughout the script. Although he read only Pages 11 
through 24 -- roughly one-fifth of the play -- that was enough for Falling 
because, in those pages, he found dialogue laced with words such as goddammit, 
hell and sons of bitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd read enough to know I didn't want to read any more of it," Falling said. 
"I found the language offensive, disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with school officials, Falling asked that his daughter be removed 
from the class and given an alternate reading assignment. Orange Glen 
administrators complied with that request, and Becky Falling -- who did not 
wish to be interviewed -- spent the final three weeks of the academic year in 
the school's library reading another book. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as someone made us aware of the problem, we remedied it within five 
minutes," Brand said. "I think we handled it reasonably and responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Literal Interpretation? 
</P>
<P>
Falling, however, also made an additional request of his daughter's teacher: 
that she cease asking all students to read aloud from "Death of a Salesman." 
When the teacher refused to do so, Falling forwarded his proposed policy to the 
Escondido school board, and has been granted 10 minutes -- he had sought an 
hour -- to argue in its behalf at next week's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
From Falling's perspective, his proposal is simply a literal interpretation of 
a state education policy that forbids the use of profane or vulgar language in 
classrooms by either teachers or students. 
</P>
<P>
The reading aloud of such language in books, Falling argues, "desensitizes" 
students to the impropriety of such behavior and "almost puts the state's 
imprimatur on that kind of offensive language." 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Union Supt. John Cooper, however, argues that the acceptable 
parameters of literature are "entirely different" from those governing 
classroom behavior, adding that it is incongruous to apply the standards of one 
to the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Many classics and widely respected books contain language that would be 
completely inappropriate if used by school employees," Cooper said. " 
'Huckleberry Finn,' I suppose, is probably the most celebrated example of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Meant to Be Heard' 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of SDSU's McLeod, the particular circumstances from which Falling's 
case arose vividly demonstrate the inadvisability and potential pitfalls of his 
proposal. While students' appreciation of any written work would be seriously 
harmed if they could not read it aloud, McLeod said, the effects would be 
"particularly devastating" in the case of a play such as "Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
"A play is meant to be heard -- the sound of a voice is what fleshes out the 
bare script," McLeod said. "Plays or poetry come alive when they're spoken. 
That's also one of the keys to interpretation. You can tell by the way someone 
reads something if he understands it." 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, while those who seek to "sanitize" classroom curriculum 
profess that doing so would enhance the quality of education, their efforts, if 
successful, could have exactly the opposite impact, McLeod argues. 
</P>
<P>
"If people object to occasional profanity in literature and try to keep high 
school students from being exposed to it, kids probably will develop more 
contempt for the unreality of school than they already have," McLeod said. 
"Schools are already criticized by students for not jibing with the world as 
they know it. Trying to strip away any potentially offensive words in 
literature would make the whole experience even more otherworldly." 
</P>
<P>
Aware that civil libertarians and most educators object to his proposal, 
Falling said he hopes to be in a position where "political realities" could 
magnify the strength of his theoretical arguments at next week's school board 
meeting. His hope, Falling said, is to go to the meeting with more signatures 
on his petitions than there were votes in the last school board election. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like them to know that there are enough people upset over this to put 
together a recall if they persist in shoving these things down our throats," he 
said. "That's hardball. But we're ready to play it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Routine Exposure 
</P>
<P>
While not discounting Falling's sincerity or concern over the issue, many local 
educators appear to believe that he has, as one put it, "made a very big deal . 
. . out of a few hells and damns." Most students, they argue, probably are 
routinely exposed to far more profane language in their everyday lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't doubt that this minister and his daughter are offended, and I 
sympathize with them, because I also find casual profanity to be very 
disturbing," McLeod said. "But when you measure their feelings against the 
'What else?' aspect, the questions of what this could lead to . . . I'd rather 
have a few hurt feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, if this girl was so offended by the words she heard read from 'Death 
of a Salesman,' I'd guess that what she hears in the hallways every day must 
really turn her ears red." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to turn that "real world" argument back upon its advocates, Falling 
contends that it supports, not weakens, his position. 
</P>
<P>
"If schools want to teach about the real world, then they ought to show 
students that it's composed of two parts, good and evil," he said. "I know 
which side I'm on. And it's not the same side as anyone who defends profanity."

FAMILY PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Child abuse, abandonment, school dropouts, teen-age pregnancies, gangs, drugs 
and prisons are so often the results of being "unwanted children." This is a 
well-documented fact. Working mostly with Hispanic women in a family planning 
clinic, I am hearing the recent and desperate concern of "what will we do 
without the help of this clinic." 
</P>
<P>
I strongly plead with the governor to restore these much-needed funds for 
family planning, which ultimately benefit us all.

MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC CLOSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I saw the front page I was sickened by what I read: "The long-awaited 
closing Friday of three Los Angeles County mental health centers has 
permanently cut off hundreds of mentally ill people from treatment, triggering 
suicide threats, confusion and frantic calls by frightened mental patients to 
the overcrowded clinics that remain open, officials said." 
</P>
<P>
The state, we are told, did not come through with the necessary funds to 
maintain much-needed mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the values of our politicians and our society? Must they, must we, 
always go where the money is, where the votes are? Where is the compassion for 
our fellow human beings? Is there no decent, caring majority in the halls and 
seats of power? 
</P>
<P>
We look around the world. Every day there are new killers and new killing 
fields. We are shocked and we deplore what is going on -- elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But we have our killers and our killing fields, too. Only our bullets come 
disguised as budget cuts.

A BILL WHOSE TIME HAS COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American parents want safer, affordable child- care programs. The U.S. Senate 
is now debating legislation that might deliver programs that meet that 
description. But the question of how best to provide this care remains in 
doubt. So is the fate of the bill, broadly cast as it is. As fast as its chief 
sponsor, Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), takes care of one objection, opponents 
offer up another. His bill is even more sound now than when it started out, and 
the Senate should vote it on its way. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodd bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and supported by 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine), would expand the amount of 
child care available and provide subsidies for care of children when their 
parents cannot afford it. Working with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas), the 
sponsors have reduced the original bill's direct federal funding for services 
and subsidies, proposing to pay some of the costs through dependent care and 
child health-care tax credits. The total bill remains $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the bill foundered on concerns about federal money going to 
religiously affiliated child- care programs. Churches and synagogues provide 
much of existing day care; backers wanted to preserve those services without 
violating constitutional questions of church-state separation. The dilemma has 
been resolved with a provision that churches and synagogue programs may receive 
federal money as long as they do no discriminate against children whose care is 
publicly subsidized and do not offer religious instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Some governors did not want Washington to write health and safety standards for 
the states. The new bill gets around that by having states set their own 
standards. But it creates an advisory panel to draft model standards that 
states could adopt if they chose. States that adopted model standards would 
qualify for extra grants; states that did not would not. The National Governors 
Assn. now supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and some Republican senators want Congress to pass only a tax 
credit for child care. But "tax credits standing alone simply do not address 
the need for affordable, quality child care for parents in the work force," 
says Marion Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund and a key 
architect of the bill. Bush's proposal would pay an average of $20 a week; 
minimal child care costs at least $75. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans charge also that the Dodd-Hatch bill will prevent parents from 
deciding who will care for their children. The charge is unsupportable. 
Families can use subsidies for care at day-care centers, at churches or 
synagogues or in private homes. It is entirely up to them. The bill actually 
would widen options by encouraging development of more day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
The day-care bill is a splendid expression of an idea whose time has come. It 
should pass now.

MURDER IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After visiting El Salvador with a human rights group and then roaming the halls 
of Congress to lobby against military aid that feeds the death squads and the 
military oppression, we know that this aid will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Congressmen seeking re-election still cannot face the "soft on communism" slur. 
They will vote our tax money to continue the war against the church and the 
people of El Salvador because they cannot define what the slur means. Anyone 
accused of it must be guilty of it unless they beat their chest in public and 
"get tough." We learned that in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, we discovered that even the liberals in Congress are still trapped in 
the left-right syndrome of thinking. "The left won in Nicaragua -- we cannot 
let them win in El Salvador," they say. 
</P>
<P>
Slogans are always better and easier in politics than facing an issue.

A BEIJING-LIKE CRISIS IN RED SQUARE COULD LEAD TO A BEIJING-LIKE SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST CONINE, Ernest Conine writes a column for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush was asked in a news conference the other day whether the events 
in China might have a chilling effect on democratic reforms in the Soviet Union 
and other communist countries. No, he replied, the reform movements will go 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Many commentators agree, arguing that the uprising in China will actually help 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev by demonstrating what can happen when reforms are resisted 
for too long. Events may well prove them right, but it's too early to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
If anything in this world is certain, it is that Gorbachev, who was in Beijing 
when the student demonstrations began, and his Kremlin comrades must view the 
breakdown of order in China with deep misgivings -- and nervousness that the 
same thing could happen in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The initial thrust of the Chinese protests, remember, was to applaud 
Gorbachev's moves toward political liberalization, and to demand similar 
reforms in China. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev tried to copper his bets. On one occasion, while still in Beijing, he 
portrayed the popular uprising as part of the painful but necessary process of 
democratic reform that is under way in all communist countries. But on another 
he sympathized with the beleaguered Chinese leaders and criticized "hotheads" 
who demand change overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"We are struggling with similar phenomena," the Soviet leader said in a 
significant passage. 
</P>
<P>
When the murderous assault on the students and their supporters came, the 
Kremlin did not join the United States and other Western governments in 
condemning the violence. Indeed, a statement rushed by the leadership through 
the new Congress of People's Deputies avoided any criticism of the Chinese army 
or political leaders, calling the events in Beijing "an internal affair." 
Soviet TV-watchers didn't see the pictures shown in the West of soldiers 
gunning down unarmed citizens. 
</P>
<P>
When Gorbachev was pressed for further comment in Bonn last week, he expressed 
hope that the reform process would not fail in China. But he still evaded 
direct comment on Beijing's claim that the student protesters were 
"counterrevolutionaries." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet restraint reflected an anxiety not to upset the normalization of 
Soviet-Chinese relations -- the big achievement of Gorbachev's visit to 
Beijing. But some Soviet observers were quick to say that more was involved. As 
a Lithuanian member of the Soviet congress saw it, the Kremlin was reluctant to 
condemn what happened in China because of the parallel with the Soviet army's 
use of deadly force against protesters in Soviet Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, important differences in the Soviet and Chinese 
situations. Gorbachev is already introducing the sort of political reforms 
demanded by the students in Tian An Men Square. His main political opposition 
comes not from liberals, but from conservatives. The Kremlin must nonetheless 
see some uncomfortable similarities. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising in China was clearly related to the spread of Western democratic 
ideas resulting from the dispatch of thousands of students abroad, the 
large-scale invasion of China by Western businessmen, academicians, journalists 
and students, the loosening of restraints on free speech and the reintroduction 
of private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
To one degree or another, all these things are also happening in the Soviet 
Union -- generating a rise in expectations akin to that which fueled the 
near-revolutionary turmoil in China. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soviet leaders can look into Eastern Europe and see the virtual 
collapse of communist authority in Poland and the looming possibility of a 
non-communist coalition government in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
At home, Communist Party functionaries are still smarting from the 
congressional elections in March, when scores of party officials were defeated 
at the ballot box. Public discontent is growing over the increasing shortages 
of food and consumer goods. Animosities are growing among the Soviet Union's 
non-Russian nationalities -- animosities that, even now, are proving difficult 
to control without oppressive measures. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, as in China, reform has translated into reduced allocation 
of resources to the military. Many Western observers believe that, in China, 
certain military leaders supported the political faction favoring brutal 
suppression of the students in order to win a bigger military budget. 
</P>
<P>
If a similar crisis arose in Moscow, would the Soviet military be inclined to 
play the role of power-broker too? Could the conservatives seize the 
opportunity to halt reform in the name of preserving communist rule? Where 
would Gorbachev himself come down? 
</P>
<P>
The hopeful assumption is that Gorbachev is too well entrenched in power to be 
vulnerable to a conservative backlash and that he, himself, is too aware of the 
Soviet Union's economic problems -- and the help it needs from the West -- to 
consider actions that would create a wave of revulsion abroad. 
</P>
<P>
It's unsettling, however, to remember that it hasn't been long since the West 
was making similar assumptions about China and Deng Xiaoping. It has yet to be 
demonstrated that, if Beijing-size mobs show up in Red Square, communist 
leaders in Moscow will behave much differently from those in China.

OUR COLD PEACE WITH JAPAN; 
</P>
<P>
AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP IS DEVELOPING, TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN M. WEBBER, Alan M. Webber, managing editor of the Harvard Business 
Review, is currently in Japan as a U.S.-Japan Society Leadership Fellow. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan is rapidly becoming America's new Soviet Union. The Cold Peace with Japan 
is replacing the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Economic policy is replacing 
foreign policy as the most critical determinant of national security; political 
allies are becoming economic adversaries. And this sudden new circumstance, so 
unpleasant for economists and politicians on both sides of the Pacific, is 
inevitable and beneficial for both the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Soviet Union has shifted America's attention from 
geopolitics to geoeconomics. In this realm, honest American observers recognize 
a discontinuity of historic proportions: Economic power and world leadership 
have come uncoupled. Japan's dynamic economy has seized the momentum and 
propelled the nation into the first position of global wealth; but Japan has no 
view of its role in the world, no mission or purpose for its new-found economic 
power. Indeed, most Japanese leaders associate the idea of a mission with the 
rise of nationalism and the rise of nationalism with militarism and the folly 
of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
America retains its sense of mission, its moral vision and global purpose. But 
its weakened economic vitality undermines both its credibility and 
effectiveness as hegemonic world leader. The United States and Japan today 
divide the four functions of world leadership: The United States is providing 
global security and the key currency; Japan is assuming technological 
leadership and global financial dominance. The two functions that Japan has 
assumed directly threaten U.S. economic interests, making the current tensions 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
But why are these tensions beneficial for each side and the long-term 
relationship? First, it is clear that Japan needs to change and cannot without 
gaiatsu -- external pressure from the United States. So rapid has been Japan's 
advance from ashes to affluence that virtually every institutional dimension in 
its way of life desperately needs reform, or risk ending up an anachronistic 
victim of Japan's economic success. For example, the Recruit Scandal pointed 
out the need for political reform, not only to purge "money-politicb" from the 
system but also to deal with a democracy in which only one party holds power 
and rural voters have four votes for every one urban vote. 
</P>
<P>
Land reform is essential, particularly in light of the 200% increase in Tokyo 
land prices in the last three years. This land bubble has financed much of 
Japan's push into foreign direct investments and created a whole new class of 
Japanese millionaires. But it has also doubled the cost of buying a home -- 
from the equivalent of 6 years of a worker's salary to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Social reform is on the agenda, for women, immigrant workers, and other 
minorities, as is the need for a new Japanese consumerism. The Japanese 
themselves talk about educational reform, by which they mean less rote learning 
and more academic creativity. But a far more essential educational reform would 
be to break the rigid dominance of the elite universities -- Tokyo University 
in particular -- as the key determinant of ultimate career success. A more 
pluralistic Japan would accept diplomas from a diverse set of universities, 
including non-Japanese schools. And there is the issue of regional economic 
development. While Japan boasts the highest per-capita gross national product 
in the world, the figure, as an average, is misleading. Tokyo is rich. But 
there are major regions of Japan that the economic miracle has left behind. 
</P>
<P>
The need for these basic reforms suggests that Japan's new wealth has created a 
new question: What is the purpose of economic growth in the 21st Century for 
Japan? For the past 40 years, the purpose has been clear: to catch up. Now 
Japan has caught up -- and more. And so the purpose of economic growth today is 
more economic growth. Adversarial pressure from the United States is the only 
way to interrupt this circularity and help the Japanese bring about the reforms 
that they need. 
</P>
<P>
What about the United States? If the U.S.-Soviet contest teaches anything, it 
is the importance to the United States of a clear adversary. For Americans to 
mobilize as a nation, there must be an "enemy at the gates" -- whether in the 
form of a challenge from a Soviet Sputnik or a Japanese semiconductor. The 
kinds of changes that America must make are as fundamental and far-reaching as 
those facing Japan: educational reform, particularly in elementary and high 
schools; worker training and retraining; technological reinvestment; 
restructuring the federal government, and more, including an honest effort to 
address the twin deficits that continue to plague the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
And just as Japan faces new questions about its future, so does the United 
States: What is America for in the 21st Century? America needs a refresher 
course in its own national values and purposes, and a rededication to those 
values in the context of a new world order. In the past, when faced with a 
clear external adversary, the United States has proved its capacity for 
self-rediscovery. Japan now offers America a chance for a new rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the worsening of U.S.-Japanese relations will also prove beneficial 
to the long-term relationship between the two countries. In some respects, the 
two nations are only now coming to discover each other. Gone is the false glow 
of early romance, replaced by a harsher but more accurate perception of 
reality. The United States is seeing Japan as it is -- not as a clone of 
itself, but as a distinct country with its own systems where even such familiar 
terms as "democracy" and "capitalism" are put into practice in wholly 
unfamiliar ways. And Japan is seeing the frailties of the United States, also 
for the first time. The United States is hardly the invulnerable hero that the 
Japanese have so greatly admired for the past 45 years. Nor is it a bottomless 
market, capable of absorbing virtually any volume of Japanese exports. The 
benefit of the Cold Peace is the chance for each side to correct its false 
impression of the other and emerge from a period of greater hostility with a 
relationship based on greater understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly the next 5 to 10 years will witness a worsening of U.S.-Japanese 
relations. Competition for the high-tech, high value-added industries of the 
future will escalate; the Japanese will move aggressively into basic research, 
further threatening American interests; Japan's industrial structure will 
facilitate techno-fusion, the joining of divergent technologies into whole new 
industries. But what will necessarily emerge from this heightened conflict is a 
U.S. strategy for its relationship with Japan -- the first time the United 
States has had such a strategy since World War II. And just as America's 
strategy for dealing with the Soviet Union provided a global framework for the 
period between 1945 and 1990, so America's strategy for dealing with Japan will 
create a new framework for geoeconomics in the 21st Century.

IMAGINARY WEAPON, REAL CORPSE; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE HAVE TRUE REASONS FOR FEAR, BUT NOT FOR DISTORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON JACKSON, Don Jackson, a black police officer, recently retired from the 
Hawthorne Police Department. Earlier this year, followed by an NBC news crew, 
he performed a sting operation investigating police harassment in Long Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most Americans support and applaud the diligent efforts of law-enforcement 
officers to maintain order and secure our streets. Random and brutal crime has 
increased to the point that our reliance on the police is overwhelming. Highly 
publicized incidents of violent street crime have shaken our society to the 
point that we often fear to leave our homes. We cry out to our guardians in 
blue for relief from criminals. Yet in calling on the police as a solution, we 
have commissioned a law-enforcement response against the criminal that too 
often is turned against the law-abiding. I know well the daily threat of 
violence and danger that police officers face. However, no American should 
justify or commend abuses by police officers under the pretense of enforcing 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
While incidents of police abuse are not exclusive to African-Americans or 
people of color, the likelihood of it happening to them is far greater. Black 
youth do not graduate into adulthood without the mark of police intimidation or 
police violence sealed in their memory. Unfortunately for Marcus Donel, his 
recent encounter with the police ended tragically. Unarmed and shot down 
without a trial or conviction, the 30-year-old Hawthorne man's misfortune again 
raises the greater questions: What is legitimate use of deadly force by police 
officers? What are the parameters? Marcus Donel's loved ones grieve their loss 
and await answers to this awful killing. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department has already given its answer to this killing. Less than 48 hours 
after the shooting, sheriff's investigators pronounced the shooting "tragic" 
but justifiable. 
</P>
<P>
This script is not new. Indeed, any kid in South-Central or East Los Angeles 
can recite it to you. A black or Latino man is stopped because he is a "viable" 
suspect in a crime. He is described as being belligerent and aggressive in his 
posture. He supposedly reaches for a weapon or "a flashy metal object." He is 
shot down in the street. No weapon is found. Typically, the man was unarmed, or 
certainly less armed than the police. Nonetheless, it is considered a good 
shooting by police standards. 
</P>
<P>
Though blacks account for less than 12% of the population in the United States, 
they compose nearly half of those killed each year by police across this 
country, according to a 1986 article in Black Scholar Magazine. Absent 
extraordinary evidence, all but a handful of shootings are confirmed as 
justifiable by police officials. Less than 3% of the fatal encounters involving 
police and private citizens in Los Angeles County result in prosecution of the 
officer, according to information provided by the District Attorney's office. 
Lacking legal resources, African-Americans who are the disproportionate victims 
of these encounters are forced to rely on law enforcement's own internal 
investigations, which often result in a questionably objective evaluation of 
the facts and evidence. 
</P>
<P>
History has taught African-American men that to be in the vicinity of a crime 
could lead to a deadly encounter. In the past, lynchings were a frequent 
solution to alleged criminal conduct by African-American males. Today's 
lynching, however, does not take place in the rolling fields of the Deep South. 
Today's lynching takes place on the concrete streets of the inner city. The 
burn of a rope around one's neck is now replaced by the explosion of a metal 
projectile from a gun barrel or the squeeze of the infamous chokehold around a 
gasping throat. The results are the same. And so are the explanations. Here and 
nationwide, the list of victims reads like a war memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The chain of events leading to the use of deadly force follows a disturbing 
pattern when cases are viewed collectively. One situation that stands out in 
nearly every shooting is that the officer feared for his life and the safety of 
others. Does fear for one's safety excuse a mistake or poor judgment? We all 
acknowledge that police officers have good reason to be scared. Yet when fear 
is out of control and clouds judgment, it must be eliminated by training and 
experience. Fear is no excuse for seeing imaginary weapons, imaginary movements 
and imaginary demeanor. Are some officers firing their weapons at 
life-threatening suspects -- or are they allowing fear to alter the 
circumstances that may exist? Fear at times exaggerates the size and strength 
of people who wind up as police-shooting victims. It can also change a beer can 
into a chrome-plated automatic. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances of many shootings by law-enforcement officers over the years 
raise questions about the integrity of police investigations into their own 
alleged misconduct. An abbreviated Southern California roll call: 1966, Leonard 
Deadwyler, unarmed, shot in the chest by a Los Angeles police officer while 
driving his pregnant wife to the hospital. Police said the shooting was an 
accident. 1979, Eulia Love, shot eight times in front of her home in the 
presence of her daughters by Los Angeles police officers. Police, called 
following a dispute over Mrs. Love's gas bill, said she was in the process of 
throwing a kitchen knife at them. 1985, Danny Smith, unarmed, shot seven times 
by Los Angeles and Culver City police officers. They said they thought they 
heard a sliding gun bolt and fired after he failed to raise his hands as 
ordered. 1986, Yusef Bilal, unarmed, shot three times in the back by a 
California Highway Patrol officer. The officer said the shooting was 
self-defense after he scuffled with him. 1988, 18-year old Frank Martinez, shot 
in the presence of his family at their home by Westminster police. The officer 
said Martinez charged at him with a beer bottle. 1988, an African man shot and 
critically wounded by Newport Beach police as he strolled along the beach with 
his wife. Officers said they mistook his portable radio for a gun. 1989, 
transient Betty Jean Aborn, shot 18 times by Los Angeles County sheriffs in the 
Antelope Valley. She had threatened a clerk with a butcher knife after she 
allegedly stole several ice cream bars from a store. 
</P>
<P>
In all of these cases, my question does not focus so much on the officers' 
intent or conduct, as malevolent as they may appear to be. Rather, my questions 
address the processes by which law-enforcement officers reach such speedy 
conclusions about the need for force when the suspect and subsequent victim is 
nonwhite. 
</P>
<P>
The patented excuses do begin to ring hollow. To say in almost every black or 
Latino male shooting that it is correct because an officer saw things that no 
one else saw is an insult to the intelligence of the public. The public must 
seek a higher standard of conduct to prevent these deadly mistakes. Most people 
killed by the police are not gang members. Everyone who exits a car to ask 
questions is not standing in a "karate stance" or with "clenched fists." Police 
officials must raise the integrity of their investigations to a level beyond 
question. It is tragic to think that any citizen in this country, has to fear 
attack by the very police officials who are paid to protect him or her.

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY SENIORS ATTEND RELIGIOUS BACCALAUREATE CEREMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Circumventing a court ruling that prohibits public schools from sponsoring 
pre-graduation ceremonies with religious themes, nearly 100 Santa Clarita 
Valley high school seniors attended a baccalaureate ceremony Sunday at a local 
Baptist church. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita's three high schools canceled their own non-religious 
baccalaureate ceremonies this year because "there was no need to have 
baccalaureate on and off campus," said Clyde Smyth, superintendent of Hart 
Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
The service was initiated and planned by Devin Franchino, Saugus High School 
student body president, who said he wanted fellow graduating seniors to have 
religious inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injunction Upheld 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1987, the state Court of Appeal unanimously upheld an injunction 
issued by an Alameda Superior Court judge in 1983 barring an invocation 
referring to "Almighty God" from ceremonies at a Livermore High School. The 
justices ruled that such an invocation would be an improper state endorsement 
of religion and might offend some members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court upheld the lower court ruling in October, 1987, when it 
refused to hear an appeal of the case. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday afternoon's ceremony, featured speaker David White, a Hart High 
School alumnus and director of the UC Santa Barbara chapter of Campus Crusade 
for Christ, exhorted graduating seniors to "choose God." 
</P>
<P>
"Make the call -- choose God. You can either be out on your own or safe with 
God. These are your simple options. There is no middle ground," White said. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong ceremony also included a Scripture reading and two songs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Prayers 
</P>
<P>
Last year, to comply with the court ruling, the three high schools in the 
district held baccalaureate ceremonies without prayers or religious figures as 
speakers. Community leaders, instead, gave talks on non-religious values and 
ethics, Smyth said. 
</P>
<P>
But Franchino said: "I come from a Christian home, so we felt it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why they can say 'under God' in our flag salute and 'In God 
We Trust' on our money and then not let us mention God at a once in a lifetime 
event like this," he added. Franchino said he approached school administrators 
and asked permission to organize a baccalaureate ceremony off campus. When they 
approved, he sought assistance from the youth minister of his church and the 
leader of a local Christian youth group, Campus After Dark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off-Campus Sponsor 
</P>
<P>
Smyth said the school district already had considered the possibility of 
finding an off-campus group to sponsor religious ceremonies for graduating 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do it legally and had been advised that if a non-district 
sponsoring group held it and it was not a school function, it would be fine," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Franchino said no school funds were used to organize the service, held at Grace 
Baptist Church in Newhall. A printer donated the more than 1,600 invitations 
mailed to graduating seniors from all Hart, Saugus and Canyon high schools. The 
service was deliberately nondenominational so that students from any religious 
background would feel comfortable participating, Franchino said. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon High School Principal Bill White, who attended the ceremony, said he was 
proud of the students who organized the event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful. It demonstrates the return of spiritual values to the 
students," he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROOMMATE FREED IN MAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Antelope Valley man who initially was arrested on suspicion of murder in the 
death of his roommate was released from jail Sunday after detectives determined 
that he may have acted in self-defense, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Greathouse, 63, fatally shot his 47-year-old roommate with a .22-caliber 
rifle during a dispute Saturday night in their desert house about 10 miles east 
of Llano near 233rd Street and California 18, Sheriff's Department spokeswoman 
Kathryn Nielsen said. The victim's identity was being withheld until relatives 
could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives, who initially arrested Greathouse on suspicion of murder, released 
him after determining early Sunday that he may have been trying to protect 
himself and his property when the shooting occurred, Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting, Nielsen added, may have been accidental, but she would not 
elaborate. The case will be presented to prosecutors early this week for a 
final determination, she said.

<P>
Five people were stabbed after a fight broke out among suspected gang members 
at a party in Acton, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador Balle, 25, of Canyon Country; Rubin Magana, 26, of Saugus; Raymond 
Moreno, 25, and Louis Ruiz, 18, both of Los Angeles, were taken to area

FIRST STEP WAS VAGUE, BUT A VOGUE FAD DIPS INTO L.A. 
</P>

To vogue or not to vogue? 
</P>
<P>
It's no longer a question. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles vogued Thursday night at "The Love Machine," a one-night event 
organized by the trendies who run the Apartment club, April La Rue and 
Christian Farrow. 
</P>
<P>
Very few of the late-late nighters attending, however, had any idea what they 
were doing. This was a test run in Los Angeles for the latest urban dance 
trend, which, in New York, incorporates modern dance movement, break-dancing, 
gymnastics, runway modeling, drop-dead fashion and a great deal of attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had to get it going now," La Rue shouted over the heads of the throng 
shoving its way into Palette in West Hollywood, where the hastily organized 
event was held. "We couldn't wait another minute. We have just got to vogue." 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, La Rue's and Farrow's Apartment club will be reopening, after 
a six-month hiatus, at the Stardust Ballroom on Sunset Boulevard and will 
feature regular competitions called vogue balls. From the looks of the 
overdressed mob elbowing into Palette, voguing is here to stay . . . at least 
for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"At last, at last," Cafe Mambo's Mario Tamayo, shouted as he strutted past the 
phalanx of security guards. "It's here!" 
</P>
<P>
But just what is it that is here? 
</P>
<P>
To vogue, according to New York's lexicographer on the scene, Chi Chi Valenti 
(who's composed a glossary of voguing terms), means to dance in a form 
"combining frozen fashion model poses and transitional steps." 
</P>
<P>
To vogue, according to Vogue magazine's editor in chief Anna Wintour, is to 
"send up the magazine a bit. The stiff posing, that old-fashioned studio look 
from the '50s, is what it's about. Although, it's not what the magazine's about 
now." 
</P>
<P>
"Houses" -- groups of 20 to 40 kids who vogue under a name -- are named for 
their founders, like New York's House of Afrika, founded by Renault Afrika 
(bank clerk Renault Verone by day). Or a house may be named for its mentor -- 
the House of (designer) Thierry Mugler or the name might send up fashion excess 
like the House of Extravaganza. Like the dancing itself, voguers poke fun at 
the older, stiffer, formal fashion titles of the '40s and '50s -- House of 
Chanel, House of Dior -- laughing at the grandness, and perhaps hoping for the 
chance to be that grand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to work out a dream in reality," said David Burns, the 
coordinator of Thursday night's "Love Machine." 
</P>
<P>
In New York it is more. Voguing is a way of life for hundreds of kids, mostly 
poor, who belong to the 20-odd recognized houses that compete against each 
other regularly for cash prizes. And this fashionable way of life is run by a 
"father" and a "mother." At first glance, this structured, paternalistic 
society may seem like a chic cult brewing; however, the "kids" who report to 
their house "mother" or "father" are usually in their late teens or early 20s. 
Some of the kids are unemployed, and it is the house mother or father who will 
help them find a job or get back into school. 
</P>
<P>
The houses in New York have been developing for "at least five years," 
according to Burns, who worked on vogue balls there for the last several years 
before coming out to Los Angeles. "Voguing goes back a long time, maybe 20 
years, when it started in Harlem -- black and Spanish kids facing off in 
costumes on speaker boxes. It's going white now, much more trendy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Rock impresario Malcolm MacLaren has already produced a record, "Deep 
in Vogue," which is moving up on the charts, and he is in negotiations with 
Columbia Pictures for a full-length feature on voguing. Thierry Mugler and 
Jean-Paul Gaultier have used voguers in their collections on the Paris runways. 
Claude Montana is next, it's rumored. And film maker Jennie Livingston is 
producing a full-length feature documentary, "one that goes back to Harlem." 
</P>
<P>
But back to voguing in Los Angeles, where no one was quite sure what was about 
to happen inside "The Love Machine." Only four houses were scheduled to "walk" 
on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was the usual club scene inside -- no room to dance, people knocking drinks 
all over each other, beat-thumping, ear-splitting '70s and '80s dance music, 
dark happenings in dark corners. A very few voguers scurried about, wondering 
where to and when. 
</P>
<P>
About 11 o'clock, seven oddly dressed people got up on the stages around the 
central dance floor and began voguing . . . so to speak. The crowd on the dance 
floor was not mesmerized by the woman in the scanty negligee striking vogue-ish 
poses. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a little preview," explained David Burns. "There'll be a show 
later." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they know what they're doing," surmised perennial late-nighter 
Rusty Updergraft, who admitted to only having read about voguing. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetic maven Gale Hayman, disappointed, was expecting "high fashion 
reminiscent of Diana Vreeland." There were only two major hats and no veils. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was getting restless. Dweezil Zappa and his entourage, and John James 
and his, left. At 1:15 a.m., Farrow and Burns decided to get the show on the 
runway. Fourteen voguers stood on the main stage, waiting for their cue -- 
MacLaren's "Deep in Vogue." They waited. They waited, several striking poses 
and trying to hold them. The crowd in the balcony took up a chant: "Vogue, 
vogue, vogue . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The music finally began. And then there was voguing. 
</P>
<P>
And cheering, and clapping, and laughing. "Princess Stephanie" of the Apartment 
House dipped her way across the stage, puckering her lips, ignoring the ranting 
crowd just like a good runway model should. Designer Jerry Jaeger of the House 
of Lovestyle stretched his lanky arms out wide, then threw his head back. 
Eduardo Lucero, a fashion illustrator, and Ramirez, who works at Modern 
Objects, both of the House of Moderns, sashayed across the stage together. One 
poseur after another swaggered, paraded, popped, dipped, spun down the narrow 
runway. Finally, the mother of the Apartment House, April La Rue, bustled out, 
distributing copies of Vogue magazine and Vogue detergent. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes of voguing; it was over. That was it. 
</P>
<P>
Voguing. It's here to stay . . . at least for this summer.

ON YOUR OWN: READERS ADVISE THE DISILLUSIONED CAREERIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD HALPERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mail keeps coming in, responding to the letter from a 40-year-old single 
woman who is highly successful in her career but who sadly wonders, "What have 
I really accomplished? Would the world really come to an end if I disappeared 
tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
Several readers expressed similar disillusionment: 
</P>
<P>
"I teach special education, and I also wonder what I have really accomplished. 
My students move on, and I rarely see or hear from them again. Many drop out; 
some end up in jail. Parents and administrators usually praise me for my 
patience but will unhesitatingly put my head on the chopping block if anything 
goes wrong. Most days I go home to an empty apartment too tired to do much 
other than take a brief walk, eat dinner and watch TV before hitting the bed 
early. 
</P>
<P>
"I am looking for a career that will enable me to take care of myself better. 
That career will include a better social life which may enable me to find a 
male companion." 
</P>
<P>
Another woman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I was a physicist for the government until I was 30. Then I married and began 
a family. I am now 35 with two children, and I intend to play housewife for a 
few more years before returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a family is definitely rewarding, and I feel that my accomplishments 
are real when I look at my children. Another option for this woman is to 
explore how she could serve her community. I think she needs the personal 
contact that comes from helping others." 
</P>
<P>
Other readers praised her pursuit of her career: 
</P>
<P>
"She is extremely fortunate to have a career. The only person you can ever 
really count on is yourself. If she had married, she may have found herself the 
sole support of the family as the result of a divorce, an illness or an 
accident. Her husband could have become a drunk, a gambler or a womanizer. Or 
she may have become bored staying at home and needed more fulfillment." 
</P>
<P>
Another woman spoke of her own frustrations in choosing the family path: 
</P>
<P>
"I am a married woman of 55 who raised three children. Like most women my age, 
a career was not even on my list of priorities. Child rearing was a woman's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"The woman who wrote this letter is the beneficiary of the social progress that 
women my age never dared to dream about. I was the classic good wife and good 
mother. We have two lovely homes, luxury cars, college-educated children and 
lovely grandchildren. But I, too, ask myself: 'What have I really accomplished? 
What did I do with my life that was so important? Would the world come to an 
end tomorrow if I were to die this minute?' 
</P>
<P>
"This woman has to be applauded. She has worked her way through the male 
business hierarchy and has made it. She should rest on her laurels, start 
building relationships unrelated to work, possibly change jobs and, most of 
all, take time to smell the roses. She can still have it all." 
</P>
<P>
Two women gave their solutions to achieving a balance between their careers and 
other needs. One wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I also lived in an elegant condo, wore expensive clothes and took wonderful 
vacations. I became a vice president of my company when I was 40 years old and 
called my friends to go out and celebrate. Everyone was busy. So I went home to 
an empty condo and never felt more alone in my life. The success was 
bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 42, I met the man who is now my husband. At the time I thought he 
was totally unsuitable. He is a blue-collar worker and I, as a professional, 
thought I had to marry a professional man. But the professional men I knew 
weren't interested in marrying professional women. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband was always there when I needed him, unlike my professional friends 
who were too busy with work or with ex-wives and children. I discovered that he 
was my type! He is kind, thoughtful, nurturing and supportive of my career." 
</P>
<P>
And from another woman: 
</P>
<P>
"I joined a support group of people interested in self-actualization, and they 
helped me to choose an area of study totally in contrast to my career. I now 
study philosophy: The study of meaningful questions. What I learn at school I 
bring back to my friends in the support group. My life, once dull, lonely and 
despairing, is now full of wonderful friends whom I really care about -- 
including, especially, myself. Incidentally, my next best friend (besides me) 
is a man I met in the group. We were married just over two years ago."

INTO THE NIGHT

The Scene: "Ghostbusters II" premiere Thursday night to benefit Saint John's 
Hospital and Health Center, with a screening at the Chinese and a party after 
at the Hollywood Palladium. (Tickets warned, "Be there or be slimed!") Columbia 
Pictures execs cruised through the evening with dollar signs in their eyes, 
thinking of a great Sequel Summer. The movie seemed to put everyone in a good 
mood as they entered the Palladium, whose lobby resembled Disneyland's Haunted 
Mansion ride. Many party-goers (paying $350 a ticket) dined and dashed, 
ensuring they headed out while the party was at mid-peak, or even pre-peak. The 
$500,000 that premiere chairman Judy Ovitz hoped to raise will go toward buying 
a Selectron Remote Afterloader (sounds like a "Ghostbuster" prop) for the 
Cancer Center's radiation therapy department. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: "Ghostbusters II" got a thumbs-up from the audience, which 
appreciated its PEV (pure entertainment value). Head-swiveling and deal-making 
were rampant at the screening and the party, as was chatter about who had seen 
the Rob Lowe tapes. The assigned-seating dinner had some grousing about where 
they had been placed in relation to where others had been placed. 
</P>
<P>
Who was there: The movie's stars -- Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, 
Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts; director Ivan Reitman; Weaver's 
dad Pat; James Woods and Sarah Owen; Paula Abdul; Bobby Brown (he performs on 
the sound track); Columbia chief Dawn Steel; Sarah Jessica Parker and Robert 
Downey Jr.; Kevin Bacon and a pregnant Kyra Sedgewick; Jon Lovitz; Phil 
Hartman; Sally Field and Alan Greisman; Norman Lear; Penny Marshall; Candy and 
Aaron Spelling; Tommy Schlamme and Christine Lahti; Barbara and Marvin Davis; 
Catherine O'Hara; Sydney Pollack; CAA chief Michael Ovitz; and a handful of 
nuns from St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
Dress mode: Industry casual -- a sea of suits and horn-rimmed glasses; women 
opted for uptown pants suits, horn-rimmed glasses and serious hair. 
Singer-choreographer Paula Abdul managed to change clothes between the 
screening and the party. 
</P>
<P>
The food: Along Came Mary catered a family-style dinner (everyone serves 
himself from huge platters) that included jumbo prawns with apple cider and 
mustard sauce, boneless breast of chicken stuffed with ricotta sage filling, 
baby asparagus, yellow squash and mushrooms and a peach and blueberry 
feuillette with puff pastry shells, creme Anglaise and vanilla ice cream. 
Thankfully, there was no theme food, like slime punch. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: A big band played on stage through dinner followed by Howard 
Huntsberry (he played Jackie Wilson with dead-on accuracy in "La Bamba"), who 
appears on the "Ghostbusters II" sound track. Dan Aykroyd also did an impromptu 
number on stage, drawing cheers from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: At the screening, a man said to his friend, a party novice: "Now 
remember, the movie is not the thing, the food is not the thing, the atmosphere 
is the thing." Gee, and we always thought it was how fast the valet got your 
car. At the Palladium, Steel watched the throngs saunter into the party and 
remarked, "I feel like we're at a bar mitzvah receiving line." 
</P>
<P>
Favor Rating: Exiting guests were handed a "Ghostbusters II" paperback book, a 
thermal mug with the "Ghostbusters II" logo, a logo pin and a weird toy that 
makes horrible high-pitched noises. Presumably, it can be used when the car 
alarm is on the fritz. 
</P>
<P>
Th-th-th-that's all, folks: A sweaty, portly Aykroyd, when asked for a comment, 
declared: "I've done all the press, I have nothing to say, I had a good time."

NO DANCING IN EMPTY EAST COAST 'BALLROOMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Make Believe Ballrooms. By Peter J. Smith (Atlantic Monthly Press: $18.95; 292 
pp.). 
</P>
<P>
What a surpassingly strange genre this is, these unpleasant little narratives 
of wasted East Coast youth, that Bret Easton Ellis -- in a quote that goes far 
beyond a blurb and into the realms of pontification -- labels "comedy of 
irritation." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis is right about one thing: "Make Believe Ballrooms" is supremely 
irritating. I can't state that strongly enough. "Make Believe Ballrooms" is so 
irritating that you don't get a chance to notice the plot is nonexistent (but 
the author is very talented), until after you've calmed down. 
</P>
<P>
This novel is a hymn of hatred to the whole human race, and Peter J. Smith 
succeeds -- like a bratty little kid, bonking, bonking on one note of the 
piano, until the rest of the assembled company rise up as one and shout, 
"ENOUGH! Get some of your toys and go play outside for awhile. We can't take it 
anymore!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Egregious Errors 
</P>
<P>
The point is: The author has set out to write a fatuous, plotless, stupid 
little novel; he succeeded admirably. Bret Ellis likes it. His publishers must 
have liked it. His editor liked it so much that he let his author get away with 
egregious technical errors like letting the groom walk down the aisle at a 
wedding, or racist inaccuracies like calling three Iranians "Moishe" (thus 
managing to be both anti-Iranian and anti-Semitic at the same time), calling a 
10-year-old sheep a "lamb," and I don't know what all. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, the subheading under the above-mentioned "point" is, of course, this 
is a parochial review, from the West Coast, and all that. On the other hand, 
"Make Believe Ballrooms" is nothing if not a parochial novel, taking the 
position that New York City, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Miss 
Porter's School make up the world. OK. No problem. Maybe they make up the 
world, and maybe the author, publisher and editor are correct in that 
assumption. My parochial answer to that would be: That still doesn't make a 
10-year-old sheep a lamb. 
</P>
<P>
The plot: Hal has a brother, Beck, who is marrying the most-awful nouveau riche 
woman in the world, "Little Lisa Lyman." Hal has a sister, Fishie, who is such 
a competitive swimmer that she shaves her head. Hal, Beck and Fishie drive 
around in a family car named "Son." "Little Lisa Lyman" has a 7-year-old 
brother named "Sir," and a grandma named "Sug," for "Shut Up, Grandma." Hal's 
own nickname is "Children." My, those East Coast folks surely live in the fast 
lane! And when Hal is rescued from his own anomie and ennui, it's by a girl 
from Texas, named "Mary Ann Beavers." (I think that name gets accompanied by a 
readerly sigh and the expostulation, "Ah, Ah! Eternal Youth!") Hal meets Mary 
Ann and is saved from his awful life. Beck is eventually saved from the dreaded 
"Little Lisa Lyman. . . ."

'English Major' Rules 
</P>
<P>
In between the beginning and the end, the indeterminate middle-material of the 
"English major" rules. We get an allusion to Erasmus on page 3, to Percy Bysshe 
Shelley on page 30, three pages of jejune dopiness on Emily Dickinson starting 
on page 16, a kind of interesting salute to Nathanael West's "The Day of the 
Locust," through S.J. Perleman, on page 23, line 16. Also many little jokes 
about machismo-mechanics for those who yawned through English: "Radiator," Hal 
yells, when Son, his car, breaks down. "The diverter value linings redumbrated 
at once! Use the B-900 Vatka Cloaca screws. And a fulcrum hammerhead so you 
won't disengage the bindings!" This is Perleman all right, but Perleman at his 
worst. And it's not just a function of being a young, East Coast, white male 
with no "adventures" to write from. (Joseph Olshan, for instance, fits that 
profile, and writes like an angel.) Peter J. Smith, for reasons of his own, has 
written to irritate, and succeeded. Good luck to him.

Nobu McCarthy today becomes the artistic director of East West Players, the 
second person to hold the title in the 24-year history of Los Angeles' most 
prominent Asian-American theater company. Her predecessor, Mako, resigned after 
an artistic dispute with the company's board last January. McCarthy, a 
Japanese-American actress, appeared with Mako in the movie "The Wash" last year 
and recently directed "Webster Street Blues" at East West. She has also 
appeared in "Karate Kid II" and has taught drama at Cal State Los Angeles.

THE POISON BREW: GLITZ AND GLITTER AT LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are those who view Poison as all flash and no substance, but perhaps the 
secret behind the hard-rock group's success -- it has had two 
multimillion-selling albums -- is that its flash is its substance. The Los 
Angeles quartet filled its Friday Long Beach Arena show -- the last of its tour 
-- with garishly colored lights, more fireworks than the Fourth of July, and 
loads of upbeat, party-down attitude. The Spandex-clad young girls, who 
composed a good three-fourths of the near-full house, couldn't have asked for 
anything more. 
</P>
<P>
However, those who did want more than glitz and glitter were bound to be a bit 
disappointed. Outside of its hits, which include remakes such as Loggins &amp; 
Messina's "Your Mama Don't Dance," there were few good songs to be had, and 
Poison's musical abilities are mediocre at best. This was never more evident 
than during drummer Rikki Rockett's and guitarist C. C. DeVille's pointless 
solos. With their lighthearted, slightly zany personas, these Gypsy-like 
rockers form an entertaining, fun-filled unit, but the whole is greater than 
the sum of its parts. 
</P>
<P>
A few months of life on the road has seasoned the second-billed Bulletboys. 
They still sound way too much like early Van Halen, but singer Marq Torien's 
brash presence has gained polish. Bret Michaels, Poison's frontman, had better 
keep on his toes -- it won't be long before Torien provides some stiff 
competition. JANISS GARZA

Four paintings and 114 prints by Andy Warhol go on the block tonight at 7:30 at 
Butterfield &amp; Butterfield's new Los Angeles auction house, 7601 Sunset 
Blvd. Two 1984 paintings of Michael Jackson are expected to bring the sale's 
top prices of $300,000 to $500,000 -- a far cry from the record $4.07 million 
paid last month at Christie's New York for Warhol's "Shot Red Marilyn." Next in 
line at Butterfield are Warhol's paintings "Endangered Species: Bald Eagle," 
($225,000 to $275,000) and "Blackglama (Judy Garland)" ($130,000 to $150,000). 
Two 1967 silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe ($20,000 to $25,000) are the most 
expensive individual prints offered. A 1974 suite of 10 floral silkscreens with 
hand-applied watercolor is valued at $25,000 to $30,000. Estimates of other 
prints, predominantly from the '80s, range from $2,500 to $20,000. Claudia Puig

PUBLIC IMAGE, NEW ORDER, SUGARCUBES: ATTITUDES IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The red-hot triple-decker tour that hit Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Friday 
and was due to return on Sunday -- with New Order joined by Public Image Ltd. 
and the Sugarcubes -- was in need only of a name to burn its memory into the 
thousands of young, impressionable minds on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Monsters of Post-Modern? Puh-leeze. Wash your mouth out with soap and write new 
wave on the board 100 times, young man. 
</P>
<P>
Woodenstock? Might fit the rather stiff ostensible headliners, New Order, but 
not the two wiry openers. 
</P>
<P>
How about Arrogancefest '89? 
</P>
<P>
Friday's show offered textbook-like, sharply contrasting examples of Attitude 
in Action. The cocky defiance of Iceland's Sugarcubes is certainly the reverse 
image of New Order's stately indifference. Somewhere in between, and much 
harder to figure out, is John Lydon's Public Image Ltd., which seems bent on 
simultaneously mocking and embracing rock cliches -- perhaps parodying its 
audience and itself, the ultimate ironic cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
Both New Order and PiL, for all their original inventiveness, give the 
impression of being trapped at the ends of their envelopes; the latter outfit 
is struggling against it, however distastefully at times, while the former band 
seems to have tastefully given in to its limitations. 
</P>
<P>
PiL's Lydon seems to get a kick these days out of riling his old fans by being 
as "mainstream" as possible, and certainly his music has never been more 
mass-appeal. The band's new album, "9," features slick production complete with 
appealing female backing vocals. On a florescent-designed stage, clad in 
blinding green, the Day-Glo ex-Sex Pistol delighted in leading clapping to the 
beat and bellowing -- with a straight face -- admonitions like "I can't hear 
you!" Does he mean any of this? Moreover, does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
If he's having fun being a caricature of himself, fine. But then where does he 
get off swiping in interviews at other artists who make the same sort of moves, 
only with sincerity? Lydon's greatest talent these days may be as a rock 
raconteur, not a musical mover and shaker, but the set was longer on 
self-conscious silliness than wit. 
</P>
<P>
If Lydon seems to be floundering around at his dead end, at least he's a 
one-of-a-kind personality and always changing, always eminently watchable. New 
Order, on the other hand, will never, ever resort to self-parody because 
there's hardly any self there to parody. Here is a group that delights in 
revealing as little of itself as possible to the audience, at least in a live 
context. What fun. 
</P>
<P>
On record, there is a loveliness to much of the quartet's forlorn post-punk, 
which is neatly divided into two alternating styles, guitar-based minimalism 
(with live drums) and Eurodisco (with drum programming). In concert, nothing 
whatsoever is added to this mix. The same effect can be achieved at home by 
spinning the record and waving colored flashlights at a photo of the band. 
</P>
<P>
The Sugarcubes weren't necessarily any friendlier than either of the two 
headlining bands. When lead singer and trumpet player Einar repeatedly told the 
crowd in his thickly accented English to "Have a nice day! Have 10 nice days!," 
there was no reason to suspect sincerity or a language barrier on his part; 
most likely, he was just being a jerk. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the crowd -- or what crowd had yet made it into the amphitheater from the 
traffic jam outside -- responded quite enthusiastically, and understandably so. 
This young Icelandic quintet has an unerring sense of rhythm and propulsion 
and, in pixieish fellow lead singer Bjork, a wonderful, soaring, catching 
female voice. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the bouncier songs, Einar and Bjork -- looking for all intents 
and purposes like a European ice skating champion -- did indeed bounce, 
unafraid to be a bit goofy. Bjork sings with real emotion in songs like 
"Motorcrash" and "Birthday," emotion you might get caught up in if you didn't 
know that these were actually unemotional, ambivalent anecdotes about, 
respectively, an automobile accident and a possible case of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's too much in this relativistic age to demand morals to their 
stories, which seethe with a cool, amoral detachment under the hot, riveting 
surface. In this show, at least, that compelling surface was enough. 
</P>

LO-TEC'S OFFERING OF LIMON AND WATT PROVIDES A LITTLE TASTE OF HEAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego dance buffs awaited a visit from the renowned Limon Dance Company as 
part of the "risky dancing" series sponsored by the San Diego Foundation for 
the Performing Arts this year. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the risks proved insurmountable, and the debt-ridden foundation 
dropped the Limon troupe (keepers of the flame for deceased modern dance 
pioneer Jose Limon) from the lineup in a desperate attempt to salvage the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Happily for local aficionados, Three's Company's Lo-Tec Series picked up some 
of the slack by featuring Limon's acclaimed principal dancer, Nina Watt, in its 
first concert of the summer. Watt, a galvanizing performer who has danced the 
master's work worldwide since joining his company in 1972, performed two Limon 
dances. 
</P>
<P>
She also included a smattering of Anna Sokolow, another early modern dance 
visionary whose work has been overlooked in San Diego. Although "Escape" and 
"The End?" -- both culled from Sokolow's modern dance masterpiece, "Rooms" -- 
might have come as a surprise to the zealots at the opening concert Saturday 
night, it was a natural choice for Watt, whose modern dance background abounds 
with names from the art form's rich past. 
</P>
<P>
With little in the way of lighting support to heighten the dramatic elements in 
her dancing, and a less-than-ideal sound track blurting out the scores, Watt 
thrust herself into the three-piece program with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
She opened the concert with Limon's "Chaconne," first performed at the 
Humphrey-Weidman Studio in New York back in 1942. Decked out in a black velvet 
evening dress, her fair hair knotted at the nape of her neck, Watt allowed the 
scratchy strands of Bach's violin solo to propel her through its sweeping 
circular phrases. 
</P>
<P>
Watt is the only member of the current company who actually worked with Limon, 
and it shows in her performance. With elegant port de bras and expressive 
dramatic intensity, Watt embodied the very spirit of the Limon style, and 
earned the wild applause that followed her appearance. 
</P>
<P>
A quick costume change and she was back for a pair of excerpts from Sokolow's 
"Rooms." Using fluttering steps that seemed to barely skim the surface of the 
stage, Watt executed the wordless ballet as if shrouded in a dreamy fog. The 
dance is fraught with emotions, and this highly dramatic dancer never failed to 
deliver. Too bad she offered only a fleeting look at this obscure modern dance 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
For her finale, Watt paid homage to the earth mother of modern dance in Limon's 
"Dances for Isadora." The five-movement piece (corresponding to the five 
periods in Duncan's life) are usually danced by different dancers. But with a 
makeshift dressing room in plain view of the audience, and a few appropriate 
hairdo and makeup changes, Watt carried off the entire piece -- beginning with 
Duncan's youthful vitality in "Primavera" and culminating with the brilliant 
image of grief in "Scarf Dance" that symbolizes the dancer's tragic death. 
</P>
<P>
A no-frills solo concert with uncomfortable seats, poor acoustics and minimal 
technical support can never take the place of a full-blown Limon Dance Company 
concert. But last weekend's Lo-Tec performance by Nina Watt was manna from 
heaven for the small band of faithful on hand for the occasion.

JOHNSON LEADS BROUGHTON PREMIERE BY VALLEY SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our rare visits to community orchestras are sometimes illuminating, sometimes 
downbeat. A drop-in at the venerable (in terms of age; it was founded in 1946) 
San Fernando Valley Symphony Saturday night proved invigorating. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Johnson, a young conductor trained in the podium arts at the Manhattan 
School and at Aspen, has led the Valley orchestra since 1985. Four years later, 
what had been sagging community interest and diminishing audiences seem to have 
been revitalized -- not least in the handsome and accomplished playing of the 
instrumental ensemble itself. 
</P>
<P>
The problems, many of them extramusical, remain. The San Fernando Valley still 
has no medium-size (forget full-size) auditorium in which to show off a real 
symphonic band; the present hall, at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, seems 
to swallow more sound than it delivers -- moreover, its lighting resources are 
at once glaring and limited. 
</P>
<P>
And the enthusiastic but not overflowing audience which attended this 
Brahms/Broughton program needs additional recruits: an orchestra named for the 
Valley ought to be serving larger numbers of Valley listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there seems to be much hope in the present status of this ensemble. In 
Johnson's carefully shaped but solid and apprehendable account of Brahms' 
Second Symphony, genuine achievement could be observed: warm, cohesive and 
well-matched string tone; firm choral balances between instrumental groups; 
strong solo voices; overall integration. 
</P>
<P>
And this performance reached its listeners. Each movement succeeded its 
predecessor in thought and profile; the longer musical line, as well as the 
Brahmsian rhetoric, communicated directly. Johnson is a conductor to watch. 
</P>
<P>
She also served well the cause of a 20th-Century melodist, film composer Bruce 
Broughton, whose "Three Incongruities" for violin and orchestra received its 
world premiere on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Endre Granat was the virtuosic and imperturbable soloist in the new concerto -- 
Broughton actually uses that subtitle -- a showpiece of violinistic effects in 
three purposeful, eclectic styles. In the opening, the composer pays homage to 
Bach and Vivaldi; in the lush heart of the work, his self-acknowledged model is 
Prokofiev; at the end, he surveys a number of other, and familiar, finales. 
</P>
<P>
Like Broughton's tuneful and well-crafted film scores, this one works. Johnson 
delivered the premiere with affection and energy. Surrounding it, the 
orchestra, led by Broughton, gave loose and sloppy readings of his "Young 
Sherlock Holmes" Suite and "Themes to 'Silverado.' "

A RARE HANDEL PASTORAL OPERA IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seldom performed, Handel's pastoral opera, "Il Pastor Fido" (The Faithful 
Shepherd), focuses on the amorous goings-on of various mythical country folk. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Howard Posner's informative program notes for the modest production 
given Friday night at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Santa Monica pointed out, 
such a work was "meant to charm, not overpower, the audience." 
</P>
<P>
While this concert performance by the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra of Handel's 
initial 1712 version did in many ways charm, it was difficult for the listener 
to transport himself to the fields of Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
One can understand the financial impossibility of mounting a staged production 
of the work. But it proved impossible to make any sense of the plot without 
burying one's eyes in the libretto. It also took a while to deduce (no mention 
of this in the notes) that the role of Mirtillo, originally for a castrato 
soprano, was being sung by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
But it was perhaps a mistake to worry about plot. After all, Handel's own 
audience concerned itself little with the words of a language they did not 
understand; they came to hear beautiful singing. 
</P>
<P>
Those who came to hear singing on Friday were generously rewarded. Soprano Kari 
Windingstat, substituting for Mary Rawcliffe on a day's notice, brought a sweet 
and limpid tone and superbly artful phrasing, though little apparent emotion, 
to the role of Mirtillo. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Catherine McCord Larsen, as the scheming Eurilla, sang with technical 
agility and a pure, suave sound. As Eurilla's rival, Amarilli, soprano Susan 
Judy conveyed emotions effectively and sang with consistent polish and style. 
</P>
<P>
Contralto Sondra Stowe, whose singing and countenance were fraught with telling 
emotion, sang the role of Dorinda with vibrancy and expressive drama, and 
countertenor Lawrence Lipnik proved equally convincing as Dorinda's lover, 
Silvio. Bass Edward Levy delivered the role of Tirenio with authority. 
</P>
<P>
Sound projection and balances were satisfactory throughout the hall, though the 
acoustics of the church sanctuary made words difficult to understand in the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Maldonado conducted an exceedingly polished and rhythmically secure 
orchestra from the first violinist's stand. TERRY McQUILKIN

Since late 1986, state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) has missed 
30% of the votes he could have cast on legislation, including more than half of 
those logged by committees on which he serves, a computer analysis shows. 
</P>
<P>
That record not only makes Campbell one of the most infrequent voters in the 
state Senate, where the average absentee record over the same period was 17%, 
but it makes him by far the member of the Orange County delegation in 
Sacramento with the highest percentage of missed votes, according to the 
analysis of legislative business conducted between December, 1986, and June 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collected $88 Per Diem 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Campbell and two other Orange County senators missed votes on days 
they checked in at the Capitol and collected their $88 per diem, attendance 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
On the Assembly side, Orange County legislators with the highest non-voting 
rates include Assemblymen John R. Lewis (R-Orange) and Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach) at 14% and 13% respectively -- records that also exceed the 8% average 
for missed votes in the lower chamber during the period covered by the 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and other Orange County legislators contacted by The Times say they 
sometimes missed votes because they were busy pushing other political agendas. 
They cautioned that these statistics should not be taken at face value, 
contending that voting alone does not make someone an effective representative. 
</P>
<P>
They say their voting records should not be viewed as a Sacramento batting 
average, but rather that their performances should be judged like those of the 
baseball player who comes through with a big hit in the clutch. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it all depends on what votes you miss and what votes you make," 
Campbell said. "If you miss (bills) where nobody votes 'no' and they are all 
technical bills, that's not an important issue. But if you miss voting on the 
budget and you miss voting on the key issues of the day, that's where your 
constituents expect you to act," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others disagree, arguing that casting a vote on a proposed law -- no matter how 
inconsequential -- is considered one of the most important aspects of an 
elected official's job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raises Question 
</P>
<P>
"If they are taking per diem and are getting paid, they should be representing 
the people. . . . It just raises a serious question as to what their priorities 
are," said Gus Owen, president of the Lincoln Club, a prestigious Orange County 
GOP support group. "If they exceed 15%, I really seriously question what they 
are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento attorney Robert Naylor, who served in the Assembly from 1978 to 1986 
and was Assembly Republican leader for two of those years, said he believes a 
legislator should miss no more than 10% of his votes, despite a crowded 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Anything more than that, Naylor and others say, leaves a legislator vulnerable 
to the perception that he is not tending to business. 
</P>
<P>
The number of votes missed by each senator and assemblyman since December, 
1986, was compiled by Legi-Tech, a computer tracking firm used by journalists, 
lobbyists, government agencies and companies that have business with the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis indicates whether a legislator votes "yes," "no" or not at all on 
each of the thousands of bills considered each session. This includes rafts of 
non-controversial bills that are usually approved -- all at once -- by 
unanimous consent. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, a senator or assemblyman who misses one of these consent votes will be 
recorded as absent for dozens -- sometimes hundreds -- of bills all at once, a 
method that Campbell and others say is unfair when considering their 
percentages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Procedures Differ 
</P>
<P>
The tracking also makes no allowance for differences in voting procedures 
between the Assembly and the Senate. In the Assembly, a person who misses a 
vote is allowed to add it later to the official record, as long as his vote 
does not affect the outcome of a bill. Senators, however, cannot change the 
record if they miss a roll call. 
</P>
<P>
As a further cross-check to Legi-Tech, The Times reviewed attendance records of 
the three Orange County state senators who scored higher than 10% in missing 
votes. Among the results: 
</P>
<P>
Campbell was the Orange County legislator who missed the most votes, failing to 
cast 3,070 out of the 10,201 possible votes on the floor and in committees. He 
missed 20% of the votes to come up on the Senate floor, and 53% -- 1,704 out of 
3,208 -- on the various committees to which he is assigned. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 state senators, the only ones to have missed more votes than Campbell 
are Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), at 46%; Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles), at 
36%, and William A. Craven (R-Oceanside) at 30%. Records show that Craven, 
however, has often missed votes because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County legislator who missed the fewest votes was freshman 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), at 3%. Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress) and Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos) both missed only 5%. 
Democrat Cecil N. Green of Norwalk recorded the highest voting percentage among 
senators representing Orange County, missing only 6%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collected Per Diem 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Sens. Campbell, Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) 
and John Seymour (R-Anaheim) missed votes on days they were recorded as present 
and eligible to collect their per diem. Campbell missed one or more votes on at 
least 38 such days. For example, he missed 25 committee votes while being 
present May 10. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour missed votes on at least 25 days that he was checked into the Capitol, 
and Royce missed votes on at least 24 days on which he was counted as present. 
</P>
<P>
Among the votes missed by Orange County legislators were measures of local 
interest. For instance, Campbell missed two Senate roll call votes on June 1 
for measures requiring developers to pay fees for the construction of Orange 
County toll roads and bridges, Legi-Tech records show. But as Campbell argues, 
his vote would have mattered little because the measures passed handily, 30 to 
4 and 26 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
Royce and Seymour both missed the May 18 floor vote on a bill that would allow 
the public Irvine Ranch Water District to invest its funds in local real 
estate. Their input would not have changed the outcome, though, because the 
measure passed 23 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the statistics, Campbell said he misses many votes because he 
is busy performing other, less visible but nevertheless important legislative 
duties. For instance, last session he was away from many roll calls to head up 
an ad hoc committee of lawmakers trying to forge a state transportation plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What's More Important? 
</P>
<P>
"So what's more important: working on a transportation problem or not voting on 
a consent calendar vote where there isn't a no vote?" Campbell asked. 
</P>
<P>
He also said his appointment to the board of the California Museum of Science 
and Industry, which is next to the Los Angeles Coliseum, takes him away one 
afternoon a month when he is scheduled to be in the Senate's Health and Human 
Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you miss it (a bill) in one committee doesn't mean you aren't going to 
see it in the next," he said. "And then you are going to see it on the floor, 
if it makes it that far." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, under indictment for allegedly forging President Reagan's signature on 
campaign literature, said his legal problems didn't contribute to his 
lower-than-average voting record. 
</P>
<P>
He said many of his missed votes were actually abstentions in protest to 
liberal-leaning legislation, and he disputed any notion that his non-voting 
record is out of line. 
</P>
<P>
"My abstaining on votes may be a concept that is too difficult for some people 
to understand, but it is completely clear and justified in my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His colleague in the Assembly, Ferguson, said his own voting record has 
suffered because he was forced to miss more than a month of the session earlier 
this year because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ferguson said, he sometimes abstains from voting if he doesn't 
fully understand the issue at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one of those guys who pushes a button just to say he pushed his 
button," Ferguson said, referring to the electronic voting system used in the 
Assembly. "I don't vote on something that I don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had to Catch Plane 
</P>
<P>
Over in the Senate, Seymour, a candidate for lieutenant governor, said he 
missed the May 18 votes because he had to leave the Capitol early to catch an 
airplane. "I had to leave before the consent calendar came up because I had a 
fund-raiser for my lieutenant governor's race in Orange County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, however, said he expects his voting percentage to soon go up, 
especially when the crush of bills hits the Legislature before the 
mid-September adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with me is how you put the numbers together," he said. "The only 
fair way to put numbers together is by an entire session." 
</P>
<P>
Royce said his voting percentage has dipped from the previous session because 
he has been away from the Capitol campaigning in a statewide effort to put a 
court reform initiative on the ballot for June, 1990. He missed 47 Senate floor 
votes on the consent calendar May 25, he said, because he left early to attend 
a 4:30 p.m. news conference in Los Angeles with U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.), kicking off the petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Royce missed 74 votes while making a speech in Kern County about 
the initiative, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Royce said that despite his missed votes, he is still working for his 
constituents by pushing the ballot measure, which includes many of the elements 
in a legislative package that he was unable to get passed last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel this issue is so important that I have made the sacrifice of pushing 
the campaign for the initiative, and as a result, my voting record for this 
session is not as good as it was in the past years," Royce said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MISSING IN ACTION 
</P>
<P>
This is how Orange County's state delegation ranks by percentage of votes 
missed in Sacramento. Tally is from Dec. 1, 1986, to June 15, 1989, a period 
that covers the last and current legislative session. The number of votes 
varies because different lawmakers sit of different committees, each of which 
considers a different number of bills.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unseasonably warm weather greeted 11-year-old Tony Aliengena on Sunday after he 
conquered the North Atlantic on his quest to fly around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano aviator glided to a picture-perfect landing at Oslo's 
Fornebu Airport, following a tedious six-hour flight from Reykjavik, Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the cockpit of his single-engine Cessna, Tony was crowded by 
Norwegian reporters and photographers, who asked him to pose by his plane. 
</P>
<P>
Then, without having to show a passport or clear customs, Tony and his 
entourage of eight were shuttled to a suburban Oslo Hotel, stopping along the 
way for a look at Norway's Royal Palace, home of King Olav IV. On the drive, 
they saw scores of picnicking families and bicyclists brought out by the 
80-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
Oslo's heat wave came as a welcome respite from the bitter cold that Tony 
experienced during his 2,500-mile journey across the icy North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the treacherous crossing that has claimed the lives of other, less 
fortunate aviators, fourth-grader Tony seemed nonchalant. 
</P>
<P>
"No sweat," he said. "It was a piece of cake." 
</P>
<P>
His father, however, was so exhausted that he expressed little excitement upon 
spotting the Norwegian coast, with its shoreline of snowcapped mountains and 
breathtaking fiords. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go out and party, except I am too tired," said Gary Aliengena, 39, who 
along with Tony's mother and sister, Alaina, are accompanying him around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Flawless 
</P>
<P>
The much-feared transoceanic flight proved almost flawless during the 
1,100-mile leg between Reykjavik and Oslo. But like the first, 1,500-mile ocean 
leg between Canada and Iceland, stormy skies at the departure point set a tense 
mood for the flight. 
</P>
<P>
At flying time Sunday morning, dark storm clouds swirled over the Icelandic 
capital of Reykjavik, with intermittent rain and cold wind raging at Tony's 
fragile-looking Cessna Centurian 210. 
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters also warned of a powerful storm front churning its way 
midway across the ocean. Fog and rain from the slow-moving front fogged in a 
refueling base on the Faroe Islands, halfway to the Norwegian coast, forcing 
Tony and a chase plane to continue on without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tony and Dr. Lance Allyn, an orthopedic surgeon from Hanford, Calif., who 
is piloting a twin-engine King Air chase plane, topped off their fuel tanks in 
Reykjavik and hoped that head winds would not exhaust their fuel supply too 
early. 
</P>
<P>
The Cessna's flying range, with an added fuel tank, is 1,500 miles. The King 
Air's range is about 1,400 miles. But Allyn cautioned that strong head winds 
could significantly reduce the flying range of either plane, forcing them to 
detour to Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wished Him Luck 
</P>
<P>
As Tony was taxiing down Reykjavik City Airport, an American Ferry pilot 
watching from a heated flight office nearby shook his head and wished the boy 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not have gone up today in that airplane," said Rod Davis, of Wichita, 
Kan., who has flown the Atlantic about 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
Gudjon Atlason, a flight services manager at the airport, said that each year, 
between five and 10 small airplanes go down in the ocean between Iceland and 
Norway. Of those, he said, only perhaps a third of the passengers can be 
rescued. 
</P>
<P>
The others, said Davis, either become trapped in the capsized planes or go down 
in a place too remote for an immediate rescue. Although Tony and Allyn both had 
life preservers and rafts on board, Davis said that waves of up to 60 feet in 
the Atlantic could make it impossible to remain afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"In 95% of the cases," Davis added. "a plane has crashed into the ocean because 
it ran out of fuel." 
</P>
<P>
"Today (Tony and Allyn) should be scared to death of the North Atlantic," he 
said. "That makes you plan better." 
</P>
<P>
Allyn was clearly nervous as he revved up his engines in preparation for 
takeoff. The flight to Oslo, he noted, was nearly all over open water, whereas 
the earlier leg had been interspersed with islands and the crossing of 
Greenland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Better Be Good' 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that all of us are much more nervous than we need to be," Allyn said, 
adding that he had abstained from drink the previous night in order to remain 
alert. "I figure that since this is our longest water leg, I better be good." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the weather for the flight was not as bad as forecast. While 
departing Reykjavik, both Tony and Allyn popped above the clouds at 7,000 feet, 
instead of the 15,000 feet that had been predicted. Tony reported light icing 
on his windshield as he left the clouds behind and headed into into clear blue 
skies. 
</P>
<P>
The frontal system midway over the Atlantic, while turbulent near the ocean 
surface, was not so treacherous that Tony, who is flying at about 11,000 feet, 
could not weave in and out of the higher clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn, on the other had, could not avoid going through some ice-laden clouds 
that rose to his cruising altitude of 21,000 feet. Allyn's plane, unlike 
Tony's, has sufficient de-icing equipment to lessen the hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the flight, though, they went through skies so clear that fishing boats 
and oil rigs could be identified on the slate-gray ocean below. A particularly 
awesome sight was a portion of the Faroe Islands, where 2,000-foot cliffs 
plunge into the sea from treeless mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Early on in the flight, Tony radioed to Allyn that he was tired and could use a 
nap. But he soon caught his second wind and bantered with Allyn over the 
two-way radio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pretty Boring 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Lance, it's pretty boring up here," Tony complained to Allyn about 
halfway through the flight. 
</P>
<P>
For about 20 tense minutes, as the two planes traversed the storm front, Allyn 
was unable to pick up Tony on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to be through this by now," Allyn, jaw clinched, said as he 
maneuvered his King Air through high cumulous clouds. "It would be nice to hear 
from them." 
</P>
<P>
To Allyn's relief, Tony's bright voice finally crackled over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing pretty good here," said Tony, who was flying about 30 minutes 
ahead of Allyn. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tony and his family were so absorbed with flying that they forgot it was 
Father's Day. Sue Aliengena, riding with Allyn, reminded her husband high in 
the skies. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that today?" Gary Aliengena radioed back in surprise. "I'll be damned, 
someone remembered me." 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena celebrated in Oslo's Hotel Diplomat by ordering a bottle of champagne 
for himself and his wife. Then it was off to bed early to rest up for the 14th 
straight day on the road. The group is scheduled to fly to Stockholm, Sweden, 
for a two-day stay.

ALL RISE FOR MEDIATOR EXTRAORDINAIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated by years of legal stalling and fruitless bickering, Jerrold S. 
Oliver had lost his patience. 
</P>
<P>
Squaring off against two dozen sparring attorneys gathered in his Santa Ana 
courtroom, the Superior Court judge warned: "Pack your bags Monday morning and 
plan on staying here a while -- because you're not leaving here until we've 
settled this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, as one participant recalls, a group of tired yet triumphant 
attorneys emerged from the court with an agreement for Fullerton to pay $2.5 
million to 141 families who alleged that they had been endangered by hazardous 
wastes at the McColl dump site. 
</P>
<P>
A patient, coaxing mediator on some occasions, a hard-driving, relentless 
salesman on others, Oliver, 63, has carved during his 18 years on the bench a 
statewide reputation as a jurist capable of taking on overwhelmingly 
complicated cases and hashing out settlements. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when the volume and complexity of civil disputes have risen 
dramatically, the settlements Oliver has helped achieve have saved litigants 
countless hours -- and county taxpayers millions of dollars -- by avoiding 
years-long trials, court officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Superior Court had an American Express gold card," Assistant Presiding 
Judge James L. Smith said, "I'd give it to Judge Oliver, tell him to take a few 
months' vacation and spend whatever he wants. That's how valuable he is to us." 
</P>
<P>
Some in the legal community criticize his occasionally abrasive, take-charge 
style in settlement talks, a style that one lawyer said inspires a combination 
of "fear and respect" in litigants. But few if any quarrel with the results 
produced by a man deemed Judge of the Year for 1986 by the California Trial 
Lawyers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A $14-million settlement in the McColl dump site case, payments approaching $30 
million to thousands of survivors who claimed the remains of their loved ones 
had been mishandled at Harbor Lawn Crematory in Costa Mesa, the resolution of a 
$150-million lawsuit over the collapse of Anaheim-based Heritage Bank in 1984, 
a multimillion-dollar agreement involving the the huge 1982 Gypsum Canyon fire 
-- all bear Oliver's imprint. 
</P>
<P>
And it was just two weeks ago that the Whittier native scored his latest 
courtroom coup: an $8.5-million settlement gained by more than 900 homeowners 
who maintained that they had been victims of sloppy design and construction 
work at their Laguna Village condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason," said Oliver, who lives in La Habra, "I've always been pretty 
good at appealing to the logic and common sense of people, which is what the 
art of settlements is all about. It's really salesmanship, based on credibility 
and experience." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
52 Co-Defendants Haggling 
</P>
<P>
Just weeks before the Laguna Village agreement, an amiable resolution to the 
dispute had appeared all but impossible, as attorneys for the 52 co-defendants 
haggled over who was to blame for faulty roofing, bad drainage and other 
problems. With no money in hand from the project's developers, the leaders of 
the homeowners group were anxiously preparing to go to court and then endure 
the appeals sure to follow -- with no guarantees of success. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 attorneys in the case were laboring in anticipation of a trial 
that could have lasted 18 months. And Superior Court administrators were eyeing 
their checkbook in expectation of having to spend more than $70,000 to knock 
down courtroom walls and put in a new seating and sound system to accommodate 
the huge number of litigants. 
</P>
<P>
When all that was averted during a frantic three days of negotiations in 
Oliver's courtroom, it was the judge whom attorneys credited for having forged 
a "meeting of the minds" where none had existed before. 
</P>
<P>
And even when a last-minute demand by one of the defendants threatened to 
scuttle the settlement, Oliver appealed to the interests of the entire group in 
open court to help preserve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Allowing People to Explain' 
</P>
<P>
Daniel A. Nordberg, an Irvine attorney who represented the Laguna homeowners, 
said: "His skill has to do with allowing people to explain themselves so that 
they feel comfortable in knowing that people are listening. He's the best at 
that." 
</P>
<P>
By their nature, settlement agreements do not generally leave either side 
completely satisfied, but rather offer litigants the security of a quick and 
certain solution rather than a costly investment in the long and uncertain 
procedure of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
For the 900 Laguna homeowners who agreed to receive $8.5 million over the next 
15 years for repairs and reconstruction at the condominium complex, "it was 
just such a relief to be able to get this thing off our shoulders now," said 
Pat Gummeson, president of the homeowners' association. "To see this through 
another three, four, five years (in court) was just too much." 
</P>
<P>
For the attorneys, the settlement was no less a relief. One wrote Oliver to 
express his appreciation on behalf of both him and his children: "Your efforts 
mean they will be able to see their father during the next year." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experience in Sales 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said his bartering abilities are partly rooted in his days as a salesman 
of agricultural chemicals, after his graduation from Oregon State University in 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
A law degree, three decades in the profession and thousands of settlements 
later, Oliver said the thrill and challenge of selling a compromise to 
often-unwilling parties remains a prime motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've got a stubborn streak," he said. "When someone comes in here to 
me and says, 'We can't settle this thing,' that gets my adrenaline going." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, lawyers who have worked with Oliver said the judge allows them the 
freedom to work out a dispute on their own -- but always under the realization 
that if they stray too far into lawyerly squabbling, he will not hesitate to 
clamp down to get the talks moving. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very no-nonsense judge who is excellent at getting right to the heart 
of these very complex cases," said Betty J. McMullen, a Tustin lawyer who 
worked with Oliver extensively on the Harbor Lawn cremation case. "If it's 
humanly possible to settle a case, he'll do his darndest to get there. He 
leaves no stone unturned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Knows When to Back Off' 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Matz of Van Nuys, lead attorney for many of the homeowners around the 
McColl dump, added: "He knows when to back off and allow the lawyers do their 
thing, and he knows when to step in with a strong hand and take charge. That's 
a talent you can't teach." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some see that as a liability. A lawyer who asked not to be identified 
asserted that Oliver "tends to take control of the case from the lawyers, and 
he'll make demands that aren't necessarily commensurate with the parties' 
concerns." 
</P>
<P>
But Oliver himself said his main tool is not the force of his personality or 
his command of the law -- both considerable -- but rather the cloud of a 
potentially lengthy trial that hangs over settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to have to go to trial with these enormous multiparty cases -- 
it's too draining," he said. "I can plead and cajole and chastise all day long, 
but if I don't have the threat of an open courtroom where we're going to be 
able to try the case, I've lost my best weapon." 
</P>
<P>
A popular and assertive personality with colleagues, Oliver said he once 
considered a run for the state Legislature. But that interest, along with more 
concerted efforts to seek higher judicial posts, fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Politically Active 
</P>
<P>
Oliver had sought the position of presiding Superior Court judge in the early 
1980s, in what one judge recalled as "one of our more hotly contested 
elections," centering on political affiliations. Oliver is a Republican but 
said he does not consider himself politically active. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver also sought a position on the 4th District Court of Appeal; while 
reportedly among the last few finalists, he was passed over several times. 
</P>
<P>
He did have a temporary position at the appellate court this spring, securing 
settlements in about 38 of the 60 cases he handled there. So impressed was 
Presiding Justice Harmon G. Scoville that he said: "I think he's one of the 
finest settlement justices in the whole state." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Oliver said he is happy to continue his duties in Superior Court -- 
with added responsibility as of this month for heading the court's newly 
created unit handling complex litigation. He also plans to continue lecturing 
and conducting legal seminars around the state for law groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy where I am right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to retire in two years, travel and perhaps redevelop his golf swing. 
But he also wants to keep up with his law work through part-time private 
mediation. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you've been in there hammering away at those settlements," he said, "it's 
tough to give it up altogether."

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warner Avenue between Euclid Street and the Santa Ana River is undergoing a 
major reconstruction that will cause traffic slowdowns and detours in the area 
through September. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the $850,000 project, the city of Fountain Valley urged residents 
and businesses to seek alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
The project will primarily affect two residential neighborhoods. One is bounded 
by Euclid Street, Warner Avenue, Newhope Street and the Warner Flood Control 
Channel. The other is bounded by Newhope, Warner, the Santa Ana River, Harbor 
Boulevard and Quartz Street. 
</P>
<P>
Those who normally use Warner to enter and exit their neighborhoods will have 
to use Euclid and Newhope streets.

POSTSCRIPT: CLASSMATES KEEP SLAIN STUDENT'S NAME ALIVE WITH AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the names of the eighth-grade students at Hewes Intermediate School in 
North Tustin are called during graduation ceremonies this evening, one will be 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
But students have made sure that the name of their former classmate, Greg 
Anderson, is not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Greg had almost completed the seventh grade when he was stabbed to death by an 
intruder one afternoon last June, just after riding his bike home from school. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Hewes wanted some kind of memorial to the 12-year-old. Earlier this 
year, they agreed on the idea of creating an annual award to be presented to 
the outstanding writer in the seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg was a good writer," Hewes principal Julie Hume said. "There was a quality 
to the way he expressed himself for someone so young. We have memorial benches, 
trees, gardens for other students who left us, but this was the thing they 
seemed to want to do for Greg." 
</P>
<P>
The memorial award will be presented for the first time Monday during the 
Hewes' annual award ceremonies, at which the school's top students in various 
subjects are honored. 
</P>
<P>
This year, two students will receive the Greg Anderson writing award: 
seventh-grader Jane Park and eighth-grader Lisa Blaydes. The award is going to 
an eighth-grader this year because that would have been Greg's class, Hume 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Each student will receive an engraved medal, and their names will go on a 
plaque kept in the school library. The students raised the money for the award 
themselves by putting change in a pickle jar at the school's supply shop. 
</P>
<P>
Greg's father, Andy Anderson, said he was moved by the students' 
thoughtfulness, especially because Greg had gone to school with them for just a 
year. The Andersons moved to East Tustin the September before Greg was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"It just meant so much to us as a family," Anderson said. "It came from the 
kids, and I think it's a marvelous token." 
</P>
<P>
Greg's stepmother, Carol Anderson, may attend the awards ceremony this year, 
but Andy Anderson said he will probably not go. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe I could," he said, "but I didn't feel like I personally could 
go without having some problems. I didn't want the kids to be upset." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have interviewed hundreds of people but have made no arrests in 
Greg's slaying, which occurred on a sunny Thursday afternoon a little more than 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Greg usually rode his motocross bike home from school about 2:30 p.m., his 
stepmother told police. She was normally at home when he arrived, but on the 
day that Greg was killed she had left the house shortly after 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Greg's sister, now 16, arrived home about 3 p.m. and found him lying face down 
in a pool of blood. A knife was found near his body. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he still hopes that investigators will solve the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any thoughts that they've shoved it on the back burner or 
something," he said, his voice filling with sadness. "It's just one of those 
situations. . . . I haven't asked about what evidence they have, what they 
don't have. It's too painful for me to even get into that part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Greg's father cheered up a bit, though, at the thought of today's award 
ceremony. "It restores my faith in our young kids when they come up with 
something like this," he said.

COLOMBIAN CLAIMING VICTORY IN RACE TO DEVELOP VACCINE AGAINST KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has never been an effective vaccine for malaria, scourge of the tropics 
and killer of millions. 
</P>
<P>
Now, many experts -- although cautious -- agree that rapidly advancing 
knowledge about immunology and malaria has reached the threshold of producing a 
vaccine that can prevent one of the most widespread and troublesome diseases 
ever known. 
</P>
<P>
And in the race to discover a preventive agent, one researcher, Dr. Manuel E. 
Patarroyo, is claiming victory. 
</P>
<P>
Patarroyo has tested his vaccine on hundreds of soldiers stationed in 
Colombia's Amazon lowlands, where malaria is endemic. Until a report on the 
field testing is published -- he has submitted it the journal Nature -- he does 
not want to divulge details, but he smiles triumphantly when asked about the 
result. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't be better," said Patarroyo, 42. "It is extremely positive." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million people a year are believed to suffer from malaria, and 
the annual death toll worldwide is estimated in the millions, with most of the 
fatalities in Africa. Although malaria can be cured with modern medicines, most 
victims lack access to effective treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The need for a vaccine has become more urgent in recent years because some 
varieties of the disease, as well as some mosquitoes that carry it, have become 
resistant to widely used medicines and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, South America, Europe and other parts of the world, 
researchers are applying bioengineering techniques in concerted efforts to 
develop malaria vaccines. Among promising projects are those at New York 
University, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the University of Maryland and the 
Pasteur Institute in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Some research aims at protection from the malaria sporozoite transmitted by 
mosquitoes. Other projects target the parasite at the merozoite stage in which 
it attacks red blood cells. It is believed that any vaccine will have to be 
protective against these different stages in the life cycle of the parasite 
that causes malaria. 
</P>
<P>
According to Patarroyo and other experts, his work is among the most advanced 
blood-stage research being done anywhere. No one else has successfully tested a 
blood-stage vaccine on human subjects, according to Dr. Lindsay Martinez, a 
World Health Organization specialist in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to have shown substantial levels of protection, and that is 
encouraging," Martinez said of Patarroyo's research. 
</P>
<P>
A thin man with a narrow face and a receding hairline, Patarroyo was wearing a 
baggy sweater one recent Saturday morning as he showed a visitor through his 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
He explained the process of isolating merozoites, analyzing their atomic 
</P>
<P>
structure and duplicating key parts of the structure by chemical synthesis. 
Stepping into the chemical synthesis room, he scooped up half a dozen vials 
full of white powder that might be mistaken for baking soda. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it," he said, opening a vial and shaking white powder into the 
visitor's hand. "This is the vaccine." 
</P>
<P>
A vaccine is desperately needed in Colombia and some nearby countries where 
malaria has been spreading rapidly. The Pan American Health Organization said 
it received reports of 1.1 million cases in the Western Hemisphere in 1988, up 
from 931,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In Colombia, the number of reported cases jumped to 101,000 from 55,000 in the 
same period, while Mexico reported an increase to 116,000 from 85,000. In 
Brazil, Latin America's most populous country, the increase was to 565,000 from 
378,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
"We can consider it an epidemic," said Joselio Branco, head of the Brazilian 
Health Ministry's anti-disease campaign office. 
</P>
<P>
Branco said the Brazilian death toll from malaria is not known, but he 
estimated that between 1% and 3% of all cases are fatal. At that rate, up to 
17,000 Brazilians died of malaria in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is preparing to lend Brazil $99 million for an anti-malaria 
program that will include spraying for mosquitoes and treating patients. The 
Brazilian government will match the World Bank funds. 
</P>
<P>
About 95% of Brazil's cases are in the Amazon region, and nearly half are in 
Rondonia, a state the size of Oregon that is being invaded by settlers and gold 
prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
Orestes Muniz, vice governor of Rondonia, said the state's hospitals overflow 
with malaria patients. "Sometimes there are two or three persons per bed," 
Muniz said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Muniz had not heard of Patarroyo's research in Colombia, he said a 
malaria vaccine would be a godsend for Rondonia. 
</P>
<P>
"It would mean a liberation from the nightmare" of malaria, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The histories of Latin America, Africa and Asia are replete with malaria 
nightmares that have frustrated ambitious development projects and decimated 
work forces. 
</P>
<P>
When the French tried and failed to build a canal through Panama in the late 
1800s, malaria and other diseases killed at least 20,000 workers over a decade. 
The United States completed the canal only after controlling malaria and yellow 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
Malaria is believed to have been brought to the New World after the voyage of 
Columbus. In tropical South America, malaria is one of several imported 
diseases that helped reduce Indian populations to a fraction of their former 
size. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the 19th Century, Europeans found that quinine, distilled from the 
bark of the South American cinchona tree, was useful in treating the disease. 
In the 1880s and '90s, they discovered that malaria was caused by the 
one-celled Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
DDT has been used to control the mosquitoes in some countries, but they are 
becoming resistant to insecticide in many areas. And increasingly widespread 
strains of the most lethal malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, have become 
resistant to chloroquine, the most effective drug for treating the disease. 
</P>
<P>
It is the P. falciparum parasite that Patarroyo's vaccine is designed to 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
In Colombia, where P. falciparum infests the southern Amazon area, malaria was 
the registered cause of about 2,000 deaths last year, Patarroyo said. But he 
estimated that the real number of malaria deaths could be three to four times 
that number. 
</P>
<P>
Patarroyo studied immunology at Rochester University under Dr. Gerald Edelman, 
winner of the 1972 Nobel Prize for medicine, and later founded the Institute of 
Immunology at the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Bogota. He now directs a 
40-member research staff at the institute. 
</P>
<P>
The synthetic protein combinations, or peptides, made in the labs are identical 
to the harmless parts of the falciparum parasite that attach to red cells in 
the blood, Patarroyo said. He said the peptides stimulate the release of 
antibodies into the blood, providing protection should the real parasite 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the same principles of chemical synthesis will soon produce 
not only vaccines for other varieties of malaria but also for such diseases as 
tuberculosis and leprosy. 
</P>
<P>
Patarroyo tested the vaccine on monkeys in 1986, announcing the results in 
1987. He then tested it on groups of army volunteers -- first only a few, then 
25, 70, 150. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine was "challenged" by injections of live malaria parasites. Patarroyo 
reported that the protection was generally successful. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine has been field tested for the last nine months on soldiers 
stationed in rural areas of southern Colombia. Patarroyo indicated that none of 
the hundreds of soldiers who received two doses of the vaccine have come down 
with malaria, while many unvaccinated soldiers in the same areas have. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will report on field testing of the vaccine in articles to be 
published this summer. Preparations are being made for more field testing in 
Venezuela and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization asked the U.S. government's Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta to verify the results of Patarroyo's trials with monkeys. 
Dr. Trenton Ruebush, a researcher with the CDC's Malaria Branch, said trials 
with monkeys in Atlanta were unsuccessful, so he and another CDC researcher 
repeated the testing in Patarroyo's laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are finding now is that in the trials being done down here, the 
monkeys do show protective responses to all three peptides," Ruebush said in 
Bogota. "We are satisfied that the antibody levels reported in the literature 
are correct." Patarroyo said the Atlanta failure was the result of flaws in the 
preparation of the vaccine by a private U.S. firm. 
</P>
<P>
Ruebush commended Patarroyo's research. "Dr. Patarroyo's group here has made 
some impressive steps toward the development of an effective malaria vaccine," 
the American said. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he cautioned, "I think it is fair to say that we still are a long way 
from a vaccine that would be used extensively in the field. Even after testing 
it in other countries, a lot of hard work has to be done in evaluation before 
it is distributed to ministries of health."

FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT: TONY CIRCLES THE GLOBE;

<P>
PRESS FINDS BOY AVIATOR LIKES TO ACT HIS AGE

<P>
Some people might relish the attention, but chances are their lives are hardly 
as young and fresh and full of promise as that of 11-year-old Tony Aliengena. 
</P>
<P>
So if this youngster would rather watch cartoons or send a paper airplane 
sailing across a room full of serious-minded adults than appear on national 
television, write it off to the frivolity and innocence of youth. 
</P>
<P>
But Tony cannot escape the limelight, and as the San Juan Capistrano 
fourth-grader continues his quest to become the youngest person to fly an 
airplane across the world, there are few places where he is not considered to 
be news. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make the shy, soft-spoken preteen break into a huge grin on one 
those rare occasions -- like his stop in Moncton, Canada -- when the press 
isn't around to greet his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The Moncton stop stood in stark contrast to his European landfall here and 
United States stops in Salt Lake City, Denver, Lincoln, Neb., and St. Louis, 
where Tony was greeted like a politician on the campaign trail, stepping out of 
his small Cessna Centurion to the flash and whirl of cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting at the airports were throngs of local reporters, as they were here, 
where Norwegian news photographers asked him in thickly accented English to sit 
astride his plane's propeller for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere, reporters have been ready to pounce on Tony with the same questions 
he had answered a dozen times before. Tony has politely fielded the inquiries 
and posed for pictures, but he has quickly tired of the press attention. 
</P>
<P>
At a stop in suburban Boston, it was all Tony could do to pull himself away 
from a card game and do yet another interview with local television, this one 
with WLVI reporter Joe Shortsleeve. 
</P>
<P>
The interview went like this: 
</P>
<P>
Reporter: "How did you pick out where you were going to stop?" 
</P>
<P>
Tony: "Umm, it was the easiest way around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Reporter: "Are you excited?" 
</P>
<P>
Tony: "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Reporter: "Anything else I should have asked you?" 
</P>
<P>
Tony: "No." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Tony dashed off to more enjoyable pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Aliengena, Tony's father, said his son does not like dealing with the 
press because he finds it tiring -- more tiring, it seems, than flying an 
airplane for hours on end. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter, Shortsleeve, said he was not surprised to find Tony so 
unenthusiastic about his trip. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way he was when we interviewed him last year (following Tony's 
record-breaking flight, at age 9, across the United States)," Shortsleeve said. 
"The problem we have, as reporters, is we don't normally interview 11-year-olds 
and can't relate. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if we had an 11-year-old asking him questions, he'd probably do a lot 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Wiesner, a Colorado businessman who is piloting one of the two chase planes 
for the flight, said that as father of a 10-year-old boy, he understands Tony's 
predicament with the press. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've got is an 11-year-old doing a very adult thing like flying around 
the world. But he is still just an 11-year-old kid," said Wiesner, 52, whose 
son, Michael, is accompanying Wiesner and his wife, Janet, on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is always accompanied at press gatherings by his father, a certified pilot 
who is riding with his son in the co-pilot's seat. Aliengena, 39, a real estate 
investor, is close at hand to help Tony field questions. 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the constant grilling from the press, Tony is apt to answer questions 
as he did in Lincoln, when a reporter inquired how long the trip was. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's response: "Umm, it's long." 
</P>
<P>
In the press conferences, Tony's boyishness is underscored by the fact he has 
to stand on a chair to be seen over the lectern. He also needs a booster seat 
in his plane to see out the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is in the habit of horsing around with other members of the entourage 
before and after the press questioning. He is accompanied on the trip by his 
10-year-old sister, Alaina, and 10-year-old Roman Tchermenekyh, his Soviet pen 
pal, in addition to Wiesner's son.. 
</P>
<P>
And Tony is not immune to childish antics. Before a Denver press session, for 
instance, he sent a paper airplane sailing across the room as his father spoke. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is equally unimpressed with big-time celebrity journalists. 
</P>
<P>
When Guy Murrel, the public relations consultant for the trip, arranged an 
interview between Tony and his father and Jane Pauley on NBC's "Today" show, 
Tony responded to the news with typical aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's Jane Pauley?," he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Roman (pronounced Ro-mar) has become almost as much of a media curiosity as 
Tony. At every press conference and public gathering, Tony introduces Roman as 
his pen pal, and Roman is called to the podium, usually wearing an oversized 
baseball cap and a shy smile. 
</P>
<P>
But Roman, who is the son of a powerful air minister who helped approve Tony's 
flight across the Soviet Union, knows little English and usually manages only a 
weak, "Hi, I Roman." He smiled widely in St. Louis, though, when a reporter 
asked through an interpreter what he had liked most about his journey across 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The most exciting thing was the amusement park in California and the cowboy 
saloon in Denver," Roman said, referring to his visits at Knott's Berry Farm in 
Buena Park and a country-western steakhouse in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
After Tony's "Today" appearance in Boston, his interpreter, Maxim V. Chikin, a 
correspondent for the Moscow youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, arranged for 
him to be interviewed by telephone by a reporter for the Soviet news agency, 
Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Later that same morning, he signed autographs for a mob of 300 elementary 
school students who had unfurled the 1,000-foot banner of U.S. friendship 
signatures that he hopes to deliver to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, however, Tony got to do what he really likes: he sat in front 
of the television, along with Roman and the other two children, watching 
cartoons.

MIKE DOWNEY: THE TOOZ COULDN'T SCARE AWAY DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Death should have feared John Matuszak. The other way around makes no sense. 
When the Grim Reaper came by to touch the Tooz on the shoulder Saturday night, 
the big guy should have sprung from his bed, ripped open his hospital gown from 
the neck down, roared like a primal beast and then poured the two of them a 
drink. He should have scared Death to death. 
</P>
<P>
When you consider how many times John Matuszak teased eternity before, toying 
with alcohol and Quaaludes and guns the way he did, working hard and playing 
harder, it is a wonder that he lived as long as he did. Yet, that's the Tooz 
for you; he was a wonder. He was large and furry and ferocious, practically a 
centaur of a man, but there was a wonderful puppy dog playfulness about him, a 
wagging tail and eager pant, that makes his passing all the sadder. 
</P>
<P>
It was more than a decade ago that Coach Paul Wiggin of the Kansas City Chiefs 
had to pound on the Tooz's chest with his fists, had to watch this 6-foot-8, 
300-pound manchild be strapped into a straitjacket and hauled away in an 
ambulance after an overload of Valium and booze. In certain ways, John Matuszak 
was dying to die. His big old heart gave out because it just couldn't keep up 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no way do you cut down a sequoia, and no way does it stand to reason 
that a man of John Matuszak's spirit and structure could be felled after only 
38 years. The Tooz lived longer and stronger in his hitch on the mortal coil 
than many do in twice the time, and he seemed somehow indestructible, even 
though other men his age have continued to excel at athletics. If nothing else, 
at least we can now remember John Matuszak forever young. 
</P>
<P>
The playing, the partying, the posturing, oh, the way this man lived. He liked 
to sneak up behind unsuspecting women and hoist them onto his shoulder, like an 
adagio dancer. One night in San Francisco, the Tooz literally picked up a pair, 
carried them toward a nearby bar -- and forgot to measure the maximum headroom, 
knocking the poor things into the transom. 
</P>
<P>
"You big dumbo! Couldn't you see we wouldn't fit?" one of the women yelled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry," said the Tooz, "but, hey, you got to play with the small hurts, as 
Vince Lombardi used to say." 
</P>
<P>
He would get away with stunts like that, because he could. No one scolded the 
Tooz, either because of that happy-go-lucky charm of his that guaranteed 
forgiveness, or because it would have been like scolding Godzilla for stepping 
on all those trains. John Matuszak simply couldn't help himself. He was what he 
was. Either you accepted it, or you waited until he went away before breathing 
easy. All we can say is, if you knew him, you probably liked him. 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely, the Tooz was out of control at times, no doubt about it. In 
college, at Tampa, Fla., he busted a fellow football player in the chops with 
an elbow during a game of pickup basketball, which eventually cost him $65,000 
in medical and legal fees. Later, in that block-long Lincoln Continental of his 
that stored so many of his worldly goods, Matuszak occasionally stashed the 
machete or the Magnum handgun that he bought on whims. 
</P>
<P>
One night outside Oakland, Kenny Stabler had to pay his roomie's bail, because 
the Tooz had been weaving all over the freeway, shooting at roadside signs. 
When the quarterback got to the jail, he found Matuszak standing outside a 
cell, wearing only three things: handcuffs, his Super Bowl ring and a pair of 
powder-blue, elephant-skin cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my roommate," Stabler said. "I'd recognize him anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
He was hell on wheels, the Tooz was. At the core of his astonishing physique 
and undeniable football-playing ability was the fire of rebellion. Coaches knew 
no way of controlling him. George Allen turned him loose in Washington after 
two weeks. Wiggin watched him nearly kill himself. John Madden fined him 
repeatedly for typical training-camp violations, like having a woman in his 
room, but, seeing as how these were the Raiders, generally the money went 
toward an end-of-the-year team party. 
</P>
<P>
The most publicized infraction of the Tooz's playing career came before Super 
Bowl XV between Oakland and the Philadelphia Eagles at New Orleans. Soon as he 
hit town, Matuszak proclaimed himself gatekeeper and sergeant-at-arms. "I'm 
going to see that there's no funny business," he said. "I've had enough parties 
for 20 people's lifetimes. I've grown up. I'll keep our young fellows out of 
trouble. If any players want to stray, they gotta go through ol' Tooz." 
</P>
<P>
Next night, ol' Tooz was dancing with another player's wife at 1 a.m., and two 
hours later, he was still as lit up as the entire French Quarter. Come morning, 
Raider Coach Tom Flores slapped him with the obligatory $1,000 fine. Far more 
offended was the coach of the opposition, straight arrow Dick Vermeil, who said 
in a huff: "If he was an Eagle, he'd be on a flight back to Philadelphia, right 
now!" 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak nearly busted a gut, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would anybody want to go to Philadelphia in the winter?" responded the 
Tooz. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it was that made John Matuszak whatever it is he was, he was one of a 
kind. He loved being with the Raiders, and they loved him. He was a hothead and 
a sweetheart and a born actor who might as well have been reading his epitaph 
when, in "North Dallas Forty," he screamed at one of his coaches that whenever 
he called it a business, they called it a game, but whenever he called it a 
game, they called it a business. 
</P>
<P>
There is no logical explanation why a man of his proportions subsisted, for 
great periods of time, on bagels smeared with Cheez Whiz and triple shots of 
Crown Royal hooch, or why, when a female friend's pet poodles annoyed him with 
their barking, he fed them sleeping pills until they rolled over and played 
permanently dead. 
</P>
<P>
That was John Matuszak. There is no explaining him, no excusing him. He was a 
one-ring circus, one no tent could contain. The man who terrorized patrons of 
saloons, who got sued for $1.5 million for football-tackling a male stripper on 
a San Francisco stage, was the same man whose parents taped an autographed 
photo on their refrigerator door, one that read: "Best Wishes to Mom and Dad. 
You're the Greatest." 
</P>
<P>
John Matuszak has gone off now, either to steal the devil's pitchfork or to 
bend the bars of the pearly gates of heaven until somebody lets him in. We can 
see him now, lifting female angels onto his shoulder. They'd recognize him 
anywhere.

DODGERS MAKE RUN FOR IT, WIN, 5-3; 
</P>
<P>
GIBSON, GONZALEZ GET THE MOST OUT OF SLOPPY PLAY BY BRAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the fifth inning with the Dodgers leading the Atlanta Braves, 2-1, Sunday, 
it appeared to be merely another high pitch from Zane Smith to Kirk Gibson. 
Merely another ball four on a day in which Smith would walk four. 
</P>
<P>
But as anyone in the National League will attest, Gibson doesn't walk anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The ball escaped catcher Jody Davis and Gibson's walk turned into a sprint. He 
rounded first, rounded second, and finally stopped at third after teammate Jose 
Gonzalez had scored from first. 
</P>
<P>
The man who routinely turns singles into doubles had outdone himself by turning 
a walk into a "triple," firing up the Dodgers and sending them to a 5-3 victory 
before 43,050 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when Fernando Valenzuela won his third consecutive game for the first 
time since April of 1987, on a day when Jay Howell took another step toward the 
All-Star game with his 14th save in 16 opportunities, it was Gibson who stole 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I would pay to see Kirk Gibson play ball," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
"And that's the highest compliment one could pay him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gonzalez: "You know when Gibson is up there, you have to be hustling, 
because he's going to be hustling." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, who jubilantly punched the thick afternoon air with his right hand 
several times after reaching third base, later smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the type of play that really excites me," he said. "I love running the 
bases like that." 
</P>
<P>
After Atlanta's Andres Thomas gave the Braves a 1-0 lead with his ninth home 
run of the season in the first inning, the Dodgers came back with a run on two 
triples (Alfredo Griffin, Mariano Duncan) and a fly ball (Gonzalez) in the 
third. Speaking of aggressive baserunning, when was the last time you saw two 
triples in one inning? 
</P>
<P>
All of this, however, only served to set up the fifth, during which Gibson's 
race began after Gonzalez hit a one-out single to center. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Gibson, who a minute later watched as Smith's ball four pitch zoomed 
inside and nearly hit him, bouncing off Davis' glove and rolling to the 
backstop. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Gonzalez is running, I know he's going to third, so I figure, I've got 
to at least go for second, get a throw down there, see what happens," Gibson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, you've got to force the issue." 
</P>
<P>
What he forced was Davis' hurried throw to second, a throw made with little 
regard for Gonzalez speeding around third. Second baseman Jeff Blauser 
intercepted the ball in front of second base while Smith hurried to cover the 
plate. He arrived at the plate too late, with Gonzalez having already scored. 
</P>
<P>
Smith then mishandled Blauser's low throw. Gibson ended up on third. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I've scored from second on a wild pitch before," Gibson said. "When 
you're running the bases, you've just got to give yourself all options. You've 
got to run hard to first, because if you don't, there's no way you have a 
chance of ever taking second. And you have to run hard to third because you 
just don't know what will happen once you get there." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson later scored on a fly ball by Jeff Hamilton, and then showed he can 
still do the ordinary by turning a single into a double in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John Shelby caught on, turning one base into two in the sixth, 
doubling and then eventually scoring the Dodgers' final run on a botched 
suicide squeeze on which the Braves pitched out but muffed the rundown. Third 
baseman Ron Gant dropped the ball when he was supposed to catch it and tag 
Shelby off third. 
</P>
<P>
All of which might explain why the young and erratic Braves lead the league in 
errors (69) after committing two more. Pitcher Smith, meanwhile, leads the 
major leagues in losses at 1-11. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't catch the ball today," said Brave Manager Russ Nixon. "We catch the 
ball, we win." 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps if they catch a little wind, they win. After Howell relieved 
Valenzuela in the eighth, he found himself holding his breath in the ninth 
after pinch hitter Jeff Treadway singled and pinch-hitter Darrell Evans lofted 
a long fly ball down the right-field line that hooked foul. Evans then struck 
out, and Dion James flied out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela gave up three runs in 7 1/3 innings for his third victory after 
beginning the season with five straight losses. The Dodgers finished the home 
stand 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, West-leading San Francisco took a bold step by trading for 
Philadelphia reliever Steve Bedrosian. Said Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive 
vice president: "I'm not going, 'Oh my gosh, a trade was made today,' " Claire 
said on a day during which two good center fielder/leadoff hitters, the kind 
the Dodgers might covet, were also traded around the league -- Philadelphia's 
Juan Samuel to the New York Mets for Lenny Dykstra. 
</P>
<P>
"We're alive, we're breathing and we have hope," Claire said. "We had reached a 
point where we could have folded, but we didn't. If we aren't getting the kind 
of offense we need, we must manufacture runs . . . and that's what we did well 
(Sunday)."

Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said Mickey Hatcher would return 
from the disabled list tonight, his strained left hamstring having recovered. 
Infielder Tracy Woodson, who will have his right quadriceps muscle examined by 
team doctors today, will likely go on the disabled list. Woodson has only 
played four times, going hitless in six at-bats, since being recalled from 
triple-A Albuquerque June 6. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph was scratched from Sunday's lineup because of a sore left 
shoulder apparently hurt while he was sliding on a first-inning steal attempt 
Saturday. He was replaced by Mariano Duncan, who moved Kirk Gibson out of the 
leadoff spot for the first time in a week and wound up going two for two with a 
double. If there is one player the Dodgers can't afford to lose, it's Randolph. 
He has 20 hits in his last 49 at-bats for a .408 average, lifting his overall 
average to a team-leading .295. Randolph has hit that well only once in his 
13-year big league career, .305 for the New York Yankees in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the crowd reaction, the highlight of a pregame romp by Dodger 
old-timers Sunday was the appearance of Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda (1954-55). 
He sharply grounded the first pitch from Dick Calmus (1963) through the legs of 
third baseman John Kennedy (1965-66) for what was ruled a base hit and then 
took the mound to get the game's only strikeout against the only batter he 
faced, Bill Grabarkewitz (1969-72). In case anybody was counting, a team of 
former Dodgers from the 1955, 1959 and 1981 world championship teams defeated 
the players from the 1963 and 1965 title teams, 6-2, led by a double and three 
RBIs from Reggie Smith (1976-81).

MATUSZAK'S CAUSE OF DEATH NOT YET KNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autopsy Sunday of former Oakland Raider John Matuszak, who died unexpectedly 
at 38, failed to determine the cause of death, said Lilie Shelton, L.A. County 
Coroner's supervising investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Further toxicological and microscopic tests will be taken within the next four 
days, she said. Those tests, which are routine according to the coroner's 
office, include drug and toxin tests, as well as examination of tissues from 
various parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Matuszak's prominence, the tests will be conducted as quickly as 
possible, Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
An investigator close to the situation said it was doubtful drugs were 
involved. A preliminary police investigation found no signs of foul play, said 
Sgt. Tom Toutant. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak's publicist, Kathy Pinckert, said the family asked officials not to 
release information until tests were completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there can be multiple causes for death," she said. "Speculation is 
futile . . . and unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak, who played on two Super Bowl championship teams before turning to an 
acting career, was taken from his Hollywood home overlooking Universal Studios 
to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank Saturday night after suffering massive 
heart failure. He died at 9:39 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak had laid on his bed and fell asleep early Saturday night, his live-in 
girlfriend, Rachel Toni, told Dale Trevillion, director and producer of 
Matuszak's latest film, "One Man Force." Matuszak was snoring when Toni went 
into the kitchen, she told Trevillion. When she returned, Trevillion said, 
Matuszak was not making any sounds. She called paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak's co-star, actress Sharon Farrell, said "One Man Force" was the break 
Matuszak needed to launch his career, but he was upset over the lack of 
promotion in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell, who talked to Matuszak a few hours before he died Saturday, said he 
was "distraught and bitter." 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak returned from a promotion trip in West Germany Thursday, and told 
Farrell that it went well, but he was anxious about the U.S. distribution. The 
film made its debut June 2 at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Trevillion, Farrell's husband who produced, directed and wrote "One Man Force," 
said Matuszak wanted to be a star. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hurting him that he hadn't made it to the top," Trevillion said. 
</P>
<P>
Trevillion said in a television interview, "He looked at supporting roles like 
being on the bench in football." 
</P>
<P>
About the news of the death, Trevillion told The Times: "It was a shock. We 
were just watching his film on the VCR when we got the call that he died. The 
guy is so big and indestructible . . . he's too full of life to be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Trevillion said Matuszak told him that he entered a drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation clinic for 1 1/2 weeks last year after the movie was made, but 
was not experiencing problems recently. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-8 Matuszak, who played with the Raiders from 1976 to 1981, had a 
reputation as a ruffian and a hard-drinking, fast-living man. The defensive end 
was an imposing figure on the field with his black-bearded scowl as he chased 
opposing quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak retired after spending the 1982 season, the Raiders' first in Los 
Angeles, on injured reserve. But he remained an embodiment of the team's outlaw 
image. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hearts go out to the Matuszak family," said Al Davis, owner of the 
Raiders. "It's tragic that their family should have to face this on Father's 
Day." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, in an interview with NBC Sports, said: "He represents the greatness of 
the Raiders, and we share in the tragedy. We tried to stay close to him and 
we'll never forget him." 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak, a native of Milwaukee, started his college career at Missouri but 
transferred to the University of Tampa in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Oilers made Matuszak the No. 1 pick in the 1973 National Football 
League draft. He was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in 1974, then joined the 
Raiders as a free agent before the second game of the 1976 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We had problems with our defensive line because several had gotten hurt and we 
had gone to a three-man line. . . . He just played a great part of our growth," 
Davis told NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very emotional moment when he retired because the team meant so much 
to him," former Raider coach Tom Flores, now general manager of the Seattle 
Seahawks, told Associated Press. "He identified with the Raiders more than 
anybody. He immediately became one of the guys. He was off-the-wall by nature, 
emotional and volatile. But a lot of that was just for effect." 
</P>
<P>
After Matuszak's retirement from pro football, he worked as an actor, starring 
in a short-lived 1985 prime time television series, "Hollywood Beat." 
</P>
<P>
He also appeared in such movies as "North Dallas Forty," "Caveman" and "Ice 
Pirates," and made frequent appearances on numerous television series. 
</P>
<P>
He also wrote his biography, "Cruisin' With The Tooz." 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak, known for his wild partying and off-the-field antics well chronicled 
in the book, had legal problems throughout the years. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested for drunken driving and possession of a concealed weapon in 
Hayward, Calif. in 1981 and in 1984 in Milwaukee for similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
On June 5, 1986, an Alameda County Superior Court jury ruled in favor of 
Matuszak in a $1.5-million lawsuit in which he was accused of beating up a male 
stripper in a barroom brawl. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleged that Matuszak crashed a ladies' night show at a Castro 
Valley, Calif., night club and threw male stripper Daniel Fisher over some 
tables and beat up the master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
The two alleged victims had sought $1.5 million in damages, but Matuszak's 
lawyer argued he was being made a scapegoat because of his fame and financial 
success. 
</P>
<P>
But those associated with Matuszak recently remember him for his kindness. 
</P>
<P>
"What a nice guy," said Carmen Miceli, owner of Miceli's Italian restaurant in 
Hollywood, a place Matuszak patronized. "Everybody loved him. He was a generous 
guy, a big spender. He'd pick up other people's tabs, and sometimes buy the 
whole house a round." 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements are pending until the coroner's deputies complete the 
tests, Pinckert said. 
</P>
<P>
Pinckert said a private family viewing and a church service will be held in Oak 
Creek, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service also is expected to be held later. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak is survived by his parents, Marvin and Audrey Matuszak of Oak Creek, 
Wis.; and three sisters -- Karen Bohlman of Orlando, Fla., Christine Evancy of 
Franklin, Wis., and Dawn Baley of West Allis, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Two brothers both died as infants of cystic fibrosis -- Christopher at two 
months and David at two years. Baley also is afflicted with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak said in his book that for years after those deaths, it pained him to 
be around children, but he eventually conquered the pain and fear. 
</P>
<P>
Bohlman said from the home of her parents that relatives were stunned by the 
death, which she said came with no warning whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was very loved by his family and we will miss him very, very much," 
she said.

SCOTT OSTLER: AS LONG AS GIBSON CAN RUN, DODGER SPIRIT WILL BURN BRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT OSTLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Showtime lives in Los Angeles, and as long as it stays alive, the Dodgers will 
not be out of the pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk (Showtime) Gibson, dropped from his leadoff spot in the batting order 
Sunday when second baseman Willie Randolph took the day off to nurse an injury, 
continued to intimidate, unnerve, outrun and out-think the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
On Old-Timers Day at Dodger Stadium, Gibson inspired memories of one Dodger 
old-timer who was in attendance in spirit only. 
</P>
<P>
"Gibson is a manufacturer of runs," Manager Tom Lasorda said after the Dodgers' 
5-3 win over the Braves. "He is as good at manufacturing runs as anyone I've 
seen since Jackie." 
</P>
<P>
That's Jackie Robinson, for you youngsters. The late Mr. Robinson is best known 
for integrating baseball, of course. But the men he played with and against 
speak reverently of his fire on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody in the stadium ever rested when Jackie Robinson got on base. He was 
daring, arrogant, alert and defiant. He wanted to bother the opposition, rattle 
them, anger them. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson comes at you with the same basic pain-in-the-fanny style. Sunday he 
walked twice, bunted for a hit, stole a base, stretched a straight single into 
a double and caused a Dodger run to score when it shouldn't have. 
</P>
<P>
With Jose Gonzalez on first base in the fifth, Gibson drew a walk, but ball 
four was inside and got past catcher Jody Davis, a wild pitch. Gibson sprinted 
to first, Gonzalez rounded second and broke hard for third, Gibson rounded 
first and broke hard for second, drawing a long throw from the backstop that 
allowed Gonzalez to score. 
</P>
<P>
That's what baseball people mean by manufacturing a run. It's a dull term for 
an exciting play. They make it sound like the run was created in a factory in 
the City of Commerce and shipped via UPS to Dodger Stadium, signed for by 
clubhouse man Nobe Kawano. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, "manufacturing" is the kind of action that makes a day at the 
ballpark worthwhile. As Lasorda said, "I would pay to see Kirk Gibson play 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson has simply been wearing out the opposition. In six games batting 
leadoff, he manufactured seven hits, seven walks and scored six runs. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, still in a leadoff frame of mind despite batting third, he was four for 
four in getting on base, and boy, were the Braves tired of seeing Gibson's 
scraggly face out there on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
When Gibson gets on base, even by a walk, all bets are off, all rules of 
civility are suspended. It's Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
It's roller-derby baseball, although Gibson wishes to stress that what he does 
should not be construed as mindless abandon, but calculated risk-taking. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to baserunning," he said, "is to give yourself the opportunity. If I 
don't run hard to first (on the wild-pitch ball four), I can't try for second. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't run yourself into outs, but you gotta force the issue sometimes. I'm 
running to second (on the wild pitch) because I know Jose Gonzalez is running 
to third, that S.O.B." 
</P>
<P>
S.O.B., of course, is a compliment in this context. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been here a season and a half, Gibson has never embraced the 
SoCal jogging mentality. He has two speeds: Painful Limp, and Damn the 
Torpedoes. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda's insertion of Gibson into the leadoff spot seven games ago may have 
been a move borne of desperation, and it certainly violated the baseball rule 
of never putting your most productive power hitter at the top of the order. But 
it was a masterful move. 
</P>
<P>
As Mike Tyson will tell you, you should come with your most powerful punch 
right from the bell. If I was Dodger manager, I would want to expose the 
opposition to Gibson as quickly as possible. I would not only bat him leadoff, 
I would have him take the lineup card up to home plate, preferably going into 
the dish spikes-high. 
</P>
<P>
Will Lasorda put Gibson back at leadoff in the future? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility, yeah," said Tofu Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
If you've paid any attention to Gibson, you probably know what he had to say 
Sunday about his preference of spots in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
"I could care less," he said. "With my speed, my job is to get on base, move 
the defensive alignments. It changes the game when I get on base." 
</P>
<P>
When Gibson gets on base, you can almost hear the opposition moan and grumble, 
you can almost see them twitch and lean forward just a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is a peaceful, predictable game until Gibson enters the fray. If 
you're on the other team, he ticks you off, wears you out. Who the hell does he 
think he is, sliding into second on an obvious single? Damn hotdog. 
</P>
<P>
If the opposition can't rest, neither can Gibson's teammates. How would you 
like to be the kid, Gonzalez, had Jose sauntered into second base on that wild 
pitch that Gibson turned into a two-baser? 
</P>
<P>
It would have been the last sauntering the young man would have done on this 
team. Gibson would have pulled Jose aside and explained the facts of life, 
i.e.: Know the situation. Give yourself the opportunity. Run, don't saunter. 
</P>
<P>
With Mike Marshall out of the lineup with a bad back and Eddie Murray slumping, 
the only way the Dodgers can stay in the race is through the marvel of 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday they gave a clinic on that facet of baseball, and wherever he was, 
Jackie, the Master Manufacturer, must have been smiling.

<P>
Lopez, who was ahead on all cards, rocked Jackson at the final bell in the

PHILLIES TRADE BEDROSIAN TO GIANTS, SAMUEL TO METS

<P>
The Philadelphia Phillies, who began Sunday as the worst team in baseball, 
traded former All-Stars Steve Bedrosian and Juan Samuel in separate deals that 
could make a major difference in both National League races. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco got Bedrosian, the 1987 Cy Young winner, and a player to be named 
later for pitchers Terry Mulholland and Dennis Cook and minor league third 
baseman Charlie Hayes. The Giants lead the Western Division by one game. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets, unable to lure power hitters Joe Carter or Danny Tartabull, 
obtained Samuel. The Mets, two games behind Chicago in the East, sent center 
fielder Len Dykstra and pitcher Roger McDowell to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that they're trying to make some headway and make things happen and you 
can't blame them for that," Bedrosian, 31, said of the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian, Samuel, Dykstra and McDowell each has had an off-year. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian, who had 40 saves in 1987 and 28 last year, has six this season. He 
was 2-3 with a 3.21 earned-run average and had gotten few save opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel, 28, had been shifted to center field this season after playing second 
base his entire career. He is batting .246 with eight home runs and 20 runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell, 28, had lost his job as the Mets' right-handed closer to Rick 
Aguilera. McDowell is 1-5 with four saves and a 3.31 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra, 26, did not like being platooned in center with Mookie Wilson. Dykstra 
is hitting .270 with three homers and 13 RBIs.

It took Greg Swindell awhile to figure out that he's not like that other former 
University of Texas ace, Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell, relying more on style that speed, scattered nine hits Sunday at 
Cleveland while pitching the Indians past the Kansas City Royals, 4-1, for his 
fifth straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
"In college, he could get in trouble and blow a couple of guys away and head 
back to the dugout," Cleveland Manager Doc Edwards said. "Up here, you can't 
get away with that, but he had to learn that. 
</P>
<P>
"His stuff is about the same as last year, but now when he get in trouble, he 
just keeps pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Swindell won his first six starts last season with a 2.09 earned-run average 
and went on to become the first 10-game winner in the major leagues with a 10-1 
mark on May 30. He lost his next five starts but still finished with an 18-14 
record and a 3.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
His first two months this season are only a little less spectacular. In his 
five winning starts, Swindell (9-1) has lowed his ERA to 2.47. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned how to pitch last year," said Swindell, who struck out six and 
walked two. "I learned I have to use all my pitches in certain situations. I 
can't just rear back and throw." 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson's 16th home run ruined Swindell's shutout bid in the sixth and tied 
the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The tie lasted less than half an inning before Mark Salas hit a two-run homer 
off rookie Kevin Appier (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can hit," Salas said. "It's a matter of getting playing time. I'm 
real happy. Doc Edwards is putting me in there and I'm getting a shot." 
</P>
<P>
"(Appier) got it up and I got the ball in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Joel Skinner's run-scoring single in the eighth gave Swindell another run to 
work with. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, Oakland 2 -- Dave Schmidt and rookie Mickey Weston combined on a 
four-hitter and the Orioles won the last three of a four-game series with the 
Athletics at Baltimore before 46,541 fans -- largest crowd at Memorial Stadium 
since opening day. 
</P>
<P>
The victory stretched Baltimore's lead to five games in the AL East, while 
Oakland leads the Angels by 1 1/2 in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Melvin hit a three-run double in the first inning off Curt Young (2-7) and 
added a run-scoring single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt (7-5) limited Oakland to three hits in six innings, retiring the first 
14 batters. Weston, making his major-league debut, yielded only one hit the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia hit a two-run homer for Oakland in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, New York 2 -- Ruben Sierra drove in three runs and knuckleballer 
Charlie Hough stopped the Yankees as the Rangers averted a four-game sweep by 
winning at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Hough (5-6), who lost eight of his previous nine decisions against the Yankees, 
did not allow a hit until Ken Phelps hit his third homer with two out in the 
fourth. The 41-year-old allowed four hits in eight innings and Jeff Russell 
pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra had an RBI single in the first and a two-run single in the third off 
Dave LaPoint (6-6) as the Rangers won for only the 34th time in 105 games at 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Fletcher had a run-scoring double in the first inning and a sacrifice fly 
in the ninth as Texas reversed two earlier decisions against LaPoint this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 8, Milwaukee 6 -- Gary Gaetti's second home run of the game, a 
two-run shot in the ninth inning, lifted the Twins past the Brewers at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Viola took a 6-3 lead to the top of the ninth, but left after Milwaukee's 
Greg Brock led off with a double. The Brewers tied the score against relief ace 
Jeff Reardon (1-2), who allowed a run-scoring double to Jim Gantner, Paul 
Molitor's run-scoring single and Robin Yount's game-tying single -- all with 
two out. 
</P>
<P>
However, Milwaukee's Chuck Crim (6-4) walked Jim Dwyer with two out in the 
bottom of the ninth before Gaetti connected. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 8, Toronto 2 -- Jay Buhner hit a two-run triple as the Mariners scored 
three runs in the first inning on their way to beating the Blue Jays at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bankhead (4-4) allowed four hits in seven innings, struck out three and 
walked four. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto's Frank Wills (0-1) yielded five runs on six hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Martinez hit a solo homer in the second and Greg Briley added a 
bases-empty shot in the fourth as the Mariners built a 7-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 7, Chicago 4 -- Luis Rivera had four singles and Joe Price earned his 
first AL victory by pitching the Red Sox past the White Sox at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Five of Boston's seven runs off Steve Rosenberg (2-3) were unearned as the Red 
Sox equaled their longest win streak of the season at three straight. 
</P>
<P>
Price (1-2) allowed five hits in six innings. Two of the hits were two-run 
homers by Fred Manrique and Ivan Calderon.

<P>
SOVIET GOALIE TRETIAK VOTED INTO HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Goaltender Vladislav Tretiak became the first Soviet player voted into the 
National Hockey League Hall of Fame Sunday in a selection committee meeting 
described as "one of the most spirited" ever. 
</P>
<P>
Also voted in was center Darryl Sittler, who played more than 12 seasons for 
the Toronto Maple Leafs, two with the Philadelphia Flyers and a final season 
with the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee failed to make an allowed third selection, passing on Bill 
Barber, Ted Green, Steve Shutt and Ed Westphal. It was the first time since 
1977 that the committee had not agreed upon three inductees in the regular 
player category. 
</P>
<P>
Herbie Lewis was also voted in, as a veteran player. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was some anticipation that the selection of a Soviet would be 
met with animosity, especially in light of some of the players passed over, 
there was no second-guessing on Sittler. 
</P>
<P>
Sittler was out for a Father's Day game of tennis with his son in Amherst, 
N.Y., when his wife was sent to give him the news of his selection and get him 
to a telephone for a conference call to the NHL meetings. 
</P>
<P>
He was thrilled, of course, with his own induction, and seemed pleased to be 
inducted with Tretiak. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the questions I'm asked most often when I'm out is who's the best 
goalie you ever played against," Sittler said. "I say I never saw a guy in 
international hockey play as consistently as he did. 
</P>
<P>
"With the way the Soviets are getting involved with the NHL, now, I'm not 
surprised. The world's getting smaller all the time. My congratulations to 
Tretiak." 
</P>
<P>
Scotty Morrison, president of the Hockey Hall of Fame, said that there had been 
a motion a year ago to consider a separate category for "non-North American" 
players. But the feeling was that anyone deserving of induction into the Hall 
of Fame should be judged against the best in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison said the discussion of Tretiak centered not on his nationality but on 
whether he had had to play, game in and game out, under the same intensity of 
competition that NHL goalies faced. 
</P>
<P>
Said Morrison: "It came down to a question of whether he was a good player, or 
whether he was a great player. The selection committee considered him to be a 
great player." 
</P>
<P>
Tretiak, 37, played on 10 world championship teams and three Olympic gold 
medal-winning teams in his long career with the Soviet National Team. He was 
also named MVP of the 1981 Canada Cup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Sittler said that his own selection was "icing on the cake," after listing his 
game-winning goal in overtime of the first Canadian Cup as his most thrilling 
time as a player, his outstanding season with the Flyers (43 goals and 40 
assists in his second year there) as the most satisfying, and his failure to 
win a Stanley Cup in his 15-year career as his biggest disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, now 85, played in the first All-Star Game in 1934. He was a standout 
left winger for the Red Wings from 1928-39 and led the Red Wings to their first 
Stanley Cup victory in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
The players will be inducted at a dinner in Toronto Oct. 3. And Lewis promised: 
"I'll have a group of about 40 -- every relative in the world is looking 
forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
Among the rule changes announced Sunday to be tried in the preseason and voted 
upon by the board of governors in September was a statute of limitations on 
supplemental discipline. That is, when an offense occurs in a game that calls 
for the NHL to review the films, hear testimony and, possibly, hand out fines 
and/or suspension time, the clubs and the league itself will have to initiate 
action within 72 hours of the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the Kings said that Pittsburgh offered to trade veteran 
defenseman Paul Coffey to the Kings for Steve Duchesne and Luc Robitaille, but 
the Kings weren't interested. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Robb Stauber's contract with the Kings reportedly is a five-year deal 
(four years and an option year) worth $1 million, with a $125,000 signing 
bonus.

ANGELUS STARS WIN IN DARING FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unlikely hero and an unexpected play helped the Angelus League all-stars to 
a 6-3 victory over the Sea View League all-stars Sunday in the opening game of 
the Seniors All-Star baseball doubleheader at Anteater Field in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul outfielder Rich Castillo, a late addition to the Angelus League 
all-stars, hit a double down the left-field line that triggered a three-run 
rally in the ninth inning. He was named the game's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't even originally picked to play," said Bob Ickes of Mater Dei, who 
coached the Angelus League all-stars. "I thought he was a second baseman." 
</P>
<P>
The Angelus League all-stars also scored three runs in the seventh inning to 
overcome a 2-0 deficit. The big play of the inning was a daring double steal 
that was executed only after some quick thinking by Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Mark Tacconelli of Servite stole home on the front end of the double 
steal, giving the Angelus League all-stars a 3-2 lead. Afterward, Ickes said it 
took two coaches and two different sets of signals to put the play in motion. 
</P>
<P>
"We never practiced or met before the game because the schools are so spread 
out," Ickes said. "We got together just before the game and went over some 
basic signals like bunting, but there was nothing set for a play like this." 
</P>
<P>
Ickes huddled with assistant Mark McNary of Servite and the two coaches took 
turns giving their respective double-steal signs to Tacconelli, who was aboard 
at third, and Mater Dei outfielder Juan Zarate, who was on first. After Zarate 
took off for second and drew the throw, Tacconelli sprinted down the line and 
beat the throw home. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't expect a play like that in a game like this, so it's perfect in a 
game like this," said Vince Brown of Tustin, who coached the Sea View League 
all-stars. "They certainly had the right guys to make the play happen . . . 
they both can run well." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams received impressive pitching. Estancia's Gabe Javage and 
Saddleback's Mike Arroyos shut out the Angelus League all-stars through six 
innings, limiting them to only four hits. Arroyos, who pitched three hitless 
innings and struck out three, was named the most valuable pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul's R.C. Chavez pitched three shutout innings for the Angelus League 
all-stars, and although Mater Dei's Tony Pena didn't pitch, he contributed a 
double in a pinch-hitting role. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitching was very good," Brown said. "You want to be careful with your 
pitchers in the summer. There's a lot of games, and you have to limit them to 
how much they throw. They all want to pitch as much as they can." 
</P>
<P>
The Sea View League all-stars opened a 2-0 lead after two innings. Leadoff 
hitter Jason White of Estancia scored the first run on a throwing error by 
Mater Dei's Jason Gill and Corona del Mar's Greg Haack drove in the second run 
with a double. 
</P>
<P>
The Angelus League all-stars had three hits in the third inning but failed to 
score off Javage. They got three more hits in the seventh inning and this time 
scored three runs, thanks to some impressive baserunning. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game: 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Coast League 8, South Coast League 1 -- Ron Kortman of Laguna Hills 
pitched the first six innings, allowing a run and four hits for the victory. He 
also had a two-run single to cap a five-run first inning for the Pacific Coast 
League. Kortman was voted the outstanding pitcher of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Helm, a catcher from Laguna Hills, had two hits, scored a run and had an 
RBI single. He was voted the most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast League scored in the second on a single by David Nemeth of 
Mission Viejo and an RBI triple by Scott Vollmer of Irvine.

VOLLEYBALL VICTORY BY DODD, SILVA SPEAKS FOR ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackie Silva uses the word forca, the Portuguese word for power, to describe 
how she and teammate Patty Dodd play on the pro beach volleyball circuit. But 
in any language, their style of play was enough to win the Huntington Beach 
Open on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd and Silva, the tournament's top-seeded team, needed all the forca they 
could find in the championship match against second-seeded Nina Matthies of 
Manhattan Beach and Elaine Roque of Santa Barbara. Using powerful spikes and 
serves, Dodd and Silva rallied from a 6-0 deficit for a 15-8 victory, their 
fourth in five tournaments this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd and Silva finished with a 5-0 record in the two-day, double-elimination 
tournament at the Huntington Beach Pier. They split $3,780 in prize money, 
bringing their tour-leading totals to $9,338 each. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, a two-time Olympian from Brazil, can count her money in English, 
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and even a little Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
When calling out signals during the championship game, Silva of Hermosa Beach 
and Dodd of El Segundo spoke Italian, just to confuse their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Italian, Portuguese, Spanish . . . whatever comes out," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
They also confused Matthies and Roque in other ways. After falling behind 6-0, 
Dodd suggested they begin serving at Roque, who struggled earlier in a 15-2 
loss to Dodd and Silva in the winners' bracket final. 
</P>
<P>
"They were serving tough early," Silva said. "But we remembered she (Roque) had 
a lot of problems with our serves." 
</P>
<P>
Silva's jump serve, which has the zing of a Mike Scott fastball, kept Roque and 
Matthies from setting a return. Silva's five ace spikes had her opponents 
thinking, and blinking, twice. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had a strong game," Silva said. "We just had to stay in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Dodd, a two-time All-American at UCLA, said she and Silva lost their intensity 
during a three-hour break before the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
After their victory in the winners' bracket final, Silva waited for Matthies 
and Roque to battle through the losers' bracket. She and Dodd's husband, Mike, 
the top-ranked player on the men's volleyball tour, played racquetball while 
they waited. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting around for three hours made us a little lethargic," Patty Dodd said. 
"We were anxious to play." Silva and Dodd have had that attitude since 
beginning their partnership this season. Silva has enjoyed success on the tour 
for the last two years, teaming with Linda Chisholm, a 1984 Olympic silver 
medalist, to win 18 of 20 tournaments they entered. 
</P>
<P>
Chisholm and Silva split up last January, after Silva returned from playing in 
Italy. Silva said she wanted to break the team up to create more parity on the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great time with Linda," she said. "She's a great player and we were 
really successful for two years. But I felt my game was a little tougher and I 
wanted to make a change." 
</P>
<P>
So Silva and Dodd formed one of the shortest teams on the circuit. Silva is 
5-foot-7 and Dodd is 5-foot-8 and they must rely on their agility and jumping 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so quick," she said. "We move really well and we always listen to each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
All they need to do is pick a language.

FIRM HOPES TO PASS DRUG TEST; 
</P>
<P>
HYCOR BIOMEDICAL LOOKS FOR WAYS TO GROW WITH DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Charles Tighe, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, 15 million Americans, from airline pilots to schoolteachers, were 
tested for drug use, and even more are expected to face screening this year. 
</P>
<P>
As drug testing becomes more common in our society, questions about the 
accuracy of test results persist, and the debate over an individual's right to 
privacy versus the public's interest in a drug-free workplace continues. 
</P>
<P>
One small company that has grown along with demand for drug testing is Hycor 
Biomedical Inc. in Garden Grove, a maker of such laboratory control products as 
specimen samples used to determine test reliability in the screening process. 
</P>
<P>
Hycor President Richard Hamill concedes that the reliability and credibility of 
drug testing remains problemtic. At the same time, his firm is developing a new 
generation of products that could greatly expand the use of drug tests in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Hycor's new "pinch test" will allow people to conduct a drug test and see the 
results on site. An athletic coach or job supervisor, for instance, could 
administer the test in the field and learn the results within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Hamill, 50, a former executive at G.D. Searle &amp; Co. and Baxter 
International, recently spoke with Times staff writer John Charles Tighe about 
the reliability of drug tests, whether the industry should be regulated and the 
legal challenges to testing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, an agency of the Department of Health 
and Human Services, last year for the first time developed standards for drug 
testing laboratories. Why did they do this? 
</P>
<P>
A. The government got very concerned about the variables of drug testing and 
the credibility of test results that were coming out of the laboratories. There 
wasn't uniformity. At one laboratory, 200 nanograms (a billionth of a gram) of 
cocaine in the specimen would be viewed as a positive. At another lab it might 
be viewed as a negative. The standard couldn't be zero because there are so 
many factors that can interfere with the results, from foreign materials to 
over-the-counter drugs that the person has taken, or the very test itself in 
the way it's performed. So the test result could come out 100 or 200, without 
the person ever consuming the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What happened after the standards were established? 
</P>
<P>
A. Last year, 150 laboratories signed up to get certified by NIDA, and only 25 
of those laboratories passed. NIDA sent samples to all the labs, who ran tests 
on the samples and returned them to NIDA, but most labs didn't meet the newly 
created standards. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the standard? 
</P>
<P>
A. For cocaine, for instance, they've determined the cutoff is 300 nanograms, 
which is an amount that rules out a lot of variables, and above that number we 
say the person is positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why did so many laboratories not meet the standards? 
</P>
<P>
A. A lot of it gets down to the laboratory. How it performs. How its people 
perform. These are big variables in results. In the labs, there are people, 
there is equipment and there are reagents, and each of those can vary during 
the course of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What level of credibility do tests have? 
</P>
<P>
A. There still is a problem. I think until all of the laboratories that are 
doing drug testing are certified by NIDA, there remains the question about the 
credibility of the results that the laboratories report. The certification 
procedure that NIDA went through or that 150 labs went through says something 
about the improvement that is still possible. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does part of the problem come from false positives -- that is, when an 
interfering material incorrectly triggers a positive test for drugs? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. That's still a problem. I think individuals that are tested should be 
interviewed about what other drugs they might be taking. Those medications can 
be as simple as over-the-counter items. That speaks to the technology and the 
limitations of the technology itself. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How can laboratories improve? 
</P>
<P>
A. They can make sure their people are adequately trained and performing their 
jobs correctly, they can use control products and use them frequently during 
the day to ensure that the results are good, that the process is in control. 
And they can apply to NIDA for certification to get that kind of outside review 
of their facilities, their equipment, their people, their training and the 
kinds of reagents they use. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the role of drug testing control products like the ones you make? 
</P>
<P>
A. The controls are substitutes for patient urine specimens. In the clinical 
laboratory many years ago, laboratory directors realized that they could run 
controls through their system periodically during the day and that these 
controls would be in line with the results they were getting from their actual 
patient tests. Then the patient samples had a known level of reliability. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Because the federal government doesn't regulate the testing firms that 
perform job-related drug tests, does this mean anyone can enter the business? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's right. But because of the competition in the services sector, with 
some very well-established large laboratories, I would think that at this point 
in time, they would have to do a pretty good selling job to convince some major 
customers, like industry or the military, that they were capable. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does the industry need to be regulated? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. I think that with the involvement of NIDA and the involvement of the 
professional societies, like the College of American Pathologists, and with the 
American Assn. of Clinical Chemists who run proficiency tests and encourage 
their member laboratories to keep certain standards, the profession manages 
itself. Laboratories are motivated to put out good results. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You have developed your "pinch test" that takes a tiny sample of blood and 
determines drug content. What impact is this test likely to have on the future 
of drug testing? 
</P>
<P>
A. It really gets to the issue of sample integrity. If a test could be 
performed, let's say, in a locker room, as opposed to being put in a container 
and then shipped somewhere else, then there is the opportunity to thwart the 
steps that come between the test site and when the test is performed in the 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Our pinch test is designed for those environments outside the laboratory. I 
think there's a nice area of growth that we've identified. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you concerned that the test might be considered an invasion of an 
individual's rights? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think that now that tests are going to be more easily performed, it is a 
fact of life that a person is going to be subjected to frequent tests. So I'm 
not sure I want to comment on the civil rights issue because our society now 
requires drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is this test a replacement for lab tests? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. It is an initial screening test that will be used in addition to a lab 
test, and the results could signal the need for a further lab screen test or a 
lab confirmation test. It's really going to expand the market. This is because 
if a screening test says that there is a reason for concern, another test will 
be asked for, and that will be sent to another laboratory for confirmation 
testing. So we're really going to expand and be a complement as opposed to 
being a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is the pinch test as reliable as laboratory screening products? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't know the answer to that right now. Our expectations are that it will 
be, and we will have to demonstrate that with test results to the FDA before we 
get approval. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the market for the test? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it has some potential anywhere that a quick indication is needed, 
whether it be in an emergency room, in an industrial employment situation, an 
athletic program or in probation departments. Those are all important markets 
for a quick, easy-to-use test system. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The inside cover of your annual report shows off the pinch test, and below 
it is a photo of a track athlete. Do you think coaches will buy the test to 
check their athletes before meets? 
</P>
<P>
A. The athletic market is going to be one of the markets. I don't know if it's 
the ideal one. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where do you see the test to be particularly valuable? 
</P>
<P>
A. Probation departments are an area we see as a real use for the product. This 
is an environment where individuals may be tested as frequently as weekly. 
Probation departments want to make sure that people on parole remain clean. 
Here they're really looking for an indication. They want to confirm that the 
person is staying free of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
So whether every test of parolees is a screening test or a confirmation test is 
not as significant, because there's going to be a history of test results, and 
any one single test is probably not going to determine the course of events. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What drugs will the tests detect? 
</P>
<P>
A. We're developing separate tests for cocaine, morphine, marijuana, 
amphetamines and PCP. The first one we will bring to the market will be 
cocaine. And for that one we will be submitting our application to the (Food 
and Drug Administration) in another month or so. Our results so far indicate 
that we have a very reliable test. 
</P>
<P>
It's a screening test, so it isn't definitive. Therefore, the kinds of 
decisions that impact people's lives are not going to depend upon our screening 
tests, whereas confirmation tests do provide that kind of assurance. 
Confirmation tests involve a more complex study, which merges two different 
research tools that provide very specific detection. 
</P>
<P>
Confirmation tests are very expensive. They run in the $100-to-$200 range. A 
screening test costs about $25 from the laboratory, and we'll probably sell 
ours to our distributors for between $3 and $5. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Your new test is very easy to perform and could be used by a job supervisor 
or a high school coach. Couldn't anybody buy these tests and interpret their 
results in a broad manner beyond the initial screen that you intend them to be? 
</P>
<P>
A. You're probably right about that. In our labeling we will try to speak to 
that issue. I think the way to be careful and assure that the product is 
properly used and finds its place is through adequate labeling and very careful 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What will the labeling say? 
</P>
<P>
A. The labeling will define the test's use, which we are now studying, and 
provide some instruction to the user as to what significance he or she should 
place on the test results in the absence of further confirmation of that 
particular result. And it will contain a thorough direction insert. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The courts are the main arena for the continuing debate over the privacy 
issues involved in drug testing. Might the courts finally decide how the 
results of rapid, on-site tests like yours can be interpreted and applied? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think there is going to have to be a lot of thought about the procedure. 
For instance, if the result is positive in a screening test like this, can 
action be taken immediately to ban an individual? We don't know how that's 
going to work. Those are questions that have to be dealt with. And I would be 
flippant if I were to say those aren't issues that have to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will there come a time when you'd be brought in to defend the results of 
your product and their consequences? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it's possible. I don't think it's very likely because the product 
will be adequately labeled as a screening test and not a confirmation test. At 
this point we would rather the results be used as an indication, rather than an 
absolute. We would rather that the results be confirmed in a laboratory using 
an acceptable confirmation test. So I'm not sure that it's going to be used 
before a track meet to say that if it's positive you therefore can't compete in 
the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Although you say you haven't been involved in court battles over testing, to 
what extent are laboratories involved in the court issues? 
</P>
<P>
A. Directors of the labs that do a significant amount of drug testing are in 
court weekly defending their test results, which is something that clinical 
laboratories did not have to do before drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there a problem with corporations and others interpreting screening tests 
too broadly? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't know the answer to that. I think this is an issue that NIDA is 
trying to address by developing standards and defining the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Has drug testing caught on outside the United States? 
</P>
<P>
A Elsewhere, drug testing is still not thought to be as necessary as it is 
here. As we go around Europe, the people essentially say, "You have a problem 
in the United States. We don't have a problem here." So, until Europeans 
perceive that the problem is greater than it is, drug testing will not grow and 
flourish and be an important part of decision-making there. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will drug testing continue to increase in popularity in America? 
</P>
<P>
A Yes. The demand will continue to increase, perhaps limited only by 
reimbursement programs and the caps that may be applied to reimbursement 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who are the largest makers of lab drug testing products? 
</P>
<P>
A. Ciba Co. and Abbot Laboratories are the largest producers of testing 
reagents for use in the laboratories. Most of the reagents are controlled by 
the two major companies, which are large, credible companies that are well 
motivated to provide laboratories with good quality material. 
</P>
<P>
For smaller companies, the opportunities are to provide screening materials for 
off-site use and for products used before the screening. 
</P>
<P>
Q. To what degree do you worry about these big companies trying to go after 
your smaller market? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's a concern. They are very formidable competitors. Should they decide to 
expand their product line and move into the pre-screen area, they would be 
tough to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where do smaller companies like yours fit in? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have to look for those little segments that we can do well in. For our 
company, we started by identifying segment in the drug testing area in the 
control side. As a small company we have to be careful about the markets we go 
after because we don't want to go up against the major companies.

U.S. FILMS TROUBLED BY NEW SABOTAGE IN SOUTH KOREA THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

SEOUL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Koreans, who during last year's Olympic Games released nonpoisonous 
snakes in theaters to sabotage the filming of movies distributed directly by an 
American firm, have escalated their campaign by placing deadly vipers in a 
movie house here. 
</P>
<P>
Two salmosa, a Korean variety of viper, were released May 27 into a movie 
theater in Seoul at which "Rain Man," distributed by Universal International 
Pictures, was playing. An additional 19 snakes, seven of them vipers, were left 
inside a bag in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Attendants also discovered four bottles of hydrochloric acid planted in the 
aisles, apparently with the idea that departing patrons would knock them over 
and suffer burns to their clothes, shoes and possibly flesh, Mike S. Pae, the 
film distributor's manager here, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one was injured in the incident, which followed the release May 3 
of nonpoisonous snakes in a theater in Pusan, it precipitated a stern protest 
from the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Culture and Information and 
security authorities were told: 'Something has to be done,' " a U.S. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On May 29 the government announced that it would crack down on violence against 
directly distributed American films, and since then no incident has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
But four years after the two governments worked out what was supposed to be a 
settlement to U.S. complaints about restrictions on distribution of American 
films here, distrust and bad blood continue. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating the pattern of last fall's violence, no one has been arrested for 
releasing the vipers. 
</P>
<P>
Other American movie firms continue to postpone the launching of direct 
distribution of their films here. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-American students, who believe the presence of U.S. troops prevents 
reunification of North and South Korea, have offered to join forces with the 
segments of the movie industry that demand that Korean middlemen be given the 
exclusive distribution rights to American films they had until the 1985 
governmental agreement. 
</P>
<P>
And Korean artists continue to insist that Americans hold off a full-fledged 
entry until they recover from the suppression they suffered under authoritarian 
regimes that ruled from 1961 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Pae said developments earlier this year had encouraged him to believe that 
troubles were dying down. But the viper incident changed his view, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, private guards have been employed in all theaters showing films 
distributed directly by United International. The guards check moviegoers' bags 
and sit in the audience to watch out for acts of sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
When movie theaters in South Korea started showing "Fatal Attraction," the 
first film distributed directly by United International during the Olympics 
last fall, Korean distributors staged demonstrations, tore up screens in movie 
theaters and released non-poisonous snakes in the aisles. Korean newspapers 
cooperated with the sabotage attempts by refusing to accept United 
International advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Only 162,000 Koreans, as a result, viewed the movie by the time it closed at 
theaters nationwide, Pae said. The sabotage, he said, deprived United 
International of "potential profits of $1 million" above its actual net profit 
of $537,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, United International's second film here, "Living Daylights," a 
James Bond thriller that opened Feb. 19, reaped a net of $1.4 million and is 
still playing in regional theaters. "Rain Man," which opened May 4, also has 
taken in a net of $1.4 million and is expected to continue for at least another 
30 days in first-run movie houses, Pae said. 
</P>
<P>
To Pae and his opponents among Korean distributors, who also produce many of 
the low-budget, pornographic films that dominate the Korean movie industry, the 
issue is money. 
</P>
<P>
If "Rain Man" had been sold outright to a Korean distributor, instead of placed 
directly with Korean theaters, Pae said, United International would have earned 
only $750,000, or half of its present net profit. 
</P>
<P>
But to artists like Lee Il Mok, chairman of the Korean Scenario Writers Assn., 
the issue is the survival of Korean movies. 
</P>
<P>
Lee shared critics' disdain for established Korean distributors cum producers. 
Under the old rules that prevailed until the U.S.-Korea governmental agreement, 
the distributors were given the right to import one foreign film for every four 
Korean movies they produced. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to enable the producers-distributors to use the profits from 
showing foreign films -- mostly American -- to underwrite the costs of 
producing Korean movies. Instead, they plowed the bulk of their profit into 
real estate investments and churned out cheap Korean potboilers to fill the 
4-for-1 quota. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, under the censorship that prevailed until President Roh Tae Woo 
took office in February, 1988, movie makers had little opportunity to produce 
high-quality films, Lee said. The Korean Central Intelligence Agency, he said, 
screened all scenarios and checked the final version of every movie. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with new freedom under Roh, "all we want is time to clean up the mess that 
(former Presidents) Park (Chung Hee) and Chun (Doo Hwan) made," Lee said. "At 
the maximum, not more than five years will be needed -- at which time we'll 
welcome anyone." 
</P>
<P>
American authorities view the Korean movie industry as possessing immense 
growth potential against the background of the country's strong economic 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
But Lee said United International had established a reputation for destroying 
local industries in other countries in which it distributed films directly. 
Brazil, for example, went from producing 300 films a year to only three after 
United International started operating there, he charged. 
</P>
<P>
Movie leaders also fear the company because of enactment of the new U.S. 
Omnibus Trade Law with its retaliatory Section 301, Lee said. Eventually, U.S. 
distributors, who have now accepted a 146-day limit on foreign showings in any 
single theater, will persuade the U.S. government to threaten retaliation 
against South Korea to get the limit lifted, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Lee's association of scenario writers is turning to the government, 
which it blames for the troubles of the past, to seek a future for itself. It 
is demanding subsidies and government-financed construction of movie theaters 
that would be devoted exclusively to showing Korean films. 
</P>
<P>
A bill submitted by opposition parties to provide subsidies is now being 
debated in the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said it appeared that "the biggest problems lie behind us." 
Referring to Korean producers-distributors who have caused most of the trouble, 
he said: "Their heart is not in it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"UIP may not have broken into the 1,000-seat movie houses but it has made it 
into 500-seat theaters," he added. Perhaps most significantly, six major Korean 
newspapers started accepting United International advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat added a note of caution, however, saying that the record of U.S. 
trade negotiations with Seoul shows that South Korea "never upholds an 
agreement unless it is forced to." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the end of the newspaper boycott came at the price of a United 
International agreement to run half-page advertisements -- far larger than 
normal -- three times with each of the newspapers for each movie its brings in. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Pae said he was proceeding with plans to bring in more United 
International films at a stepped-up pace. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, theaters that have signed up with United International will 
begin showing "The Accused" with Academy Award winner Jodie Foster. Between 
July and September, the firm will bring in "Twins," "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade" and "License to Kill" and will reissue "Fatal Attraction," Pae said.

CONDO WARS: ANYTHING BUT RETIRING

<TEXT>
<P>
Where the hell are the bills and receipts? Where, where? They keep making 
special assessments -- $5 here and $10 there. It adds up, don't let anybody kid 
you. And they never let you see the books. What -- you're supposed to trust 
them? They sneak around like ants at a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
My wife keeps saying, relax, you came here to retire and all you do is go to 
meetings. But who can help it? Is it so crazy to want to know where the money 
goes? Somebody has to stand up to these people. Liars! Smoothies! Can I say it? 
Finaglers! 
</P>
<P>
Jack Newman is talking. Or it could be Arthur Zank. Or Sol Shaffer. Any one of 
the dissidents. Yes, there are dissidents. This is a condominium: Century 
Village in Pembroke Pines. The brochure says it is a place "where living has no 
limits." Of course there are dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condo Politics 
</P>
<P>
Forget Democrats and Republicans. The most ferocious politics in America go on 
between the unit owners of condominiums. How could it be different? In a condo, 
you own the apartment, but the rest is held "in common," from the chlorine in 
the pool to the weeds under the shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
How can a man's home be his castle when he shares the moat and drawbridge with 
partners? The common good is not every man's ideal, after all. You should see 
some people. They open their front doors and fan in the air conditioning from 
the hallways. Stealing the cool! 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it would be wrong to knock it altogether. Some 16 million Americans 
live in condos, and many think it is wonderful. Let them come to South Florida. 
What goes on! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wild Board Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Board meetings get so wild, people have dropped dead. And the elections. They 
fight for proxies like piranhas. Experts blame retirees for this tumult -- no 
matter where they're from or what they once did. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them sit around and read the Condo Act all day," says Alex Knight, 
chief of the state's Bureau of Condominiums. "They have time to fight. Condo 
politics is like a hobby." 
</P>
<P>
But what the hell do bureaucrats know? Hobby? This is a hobby? This is not 
mountains from molehills. A condo association's management budget can involve 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Down here, many of the condo developments are like small cities. There are 
8,000 people in 75 buildings at Century Village in Pembroke Pines, west of Ft. 
Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
They have their own lake and 18-hole golf course and billiard room with 25 
tables. And dances and live entertainment and mah-jongg club. 
</P>
<P>
And two political factions that get along like the Monitor and the Merrimac. 
Welcome to the aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissident Owners 
</P>
<P>
"Where the hell are the bills and receipts?" Jack Newman, 70, wants to know. It 
is a rhetorical question. The paper work of the recreation building might as 
well be sacred papyrus from the Fertile Crescent, so well is it hidden from 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Newman is sitting among the dissidents in Arthur Zank's condo. Arthur, 61, the 
unofficial leader, rises to secure more potato chips. He says, "99% of the 
people don't care about any of this, but we care." 
</P>
<P>
Sol Shaffer, 63, at Arthur's side, gives the overview. "Worst deal in the 
history of Florida," he says. He is not sure that is dramatic enough: "This may 
sound like bull, but we believe in freedom and justice for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
This is why the dissidents call their newspaper the We the People News. It 
comes out once a month, and you can find people reading it in the clubhouse -- 
retirement living's very own notes from the underground. 
</P>
<P>
Editorials are so venomous they ought to print antidotes beside them instead of 
the usual recipes for stuffed cabbage and ads for podiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty years ago we fought a war to make sure this type of thing could not 
happen . . . " reads one of them as it picks up steam. "Now is the time to 
stand up and be counted among the Good Guys." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek New Management 
</P>
<P>
So what do the We the People people want? For one thing, they want to bring in 
a new management company instead of the one that was left behind by the 
developer. Management? You call this management? 
</P>
<P>
"We know for a fact the lawns are supposed to be mowed 31 times, and we know 
for a fact they only mowed them 24 times," says Sol Shaffer, retired from his 
greeting card and jewelry businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell us sometimes it rained -- we couldn't mow -- and that's an act of 
God. So why are we paying for acts of God?" 
</P>
<P>
And they want their own auditors to review the books of the recreation 
building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conniving Management? 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, they want to end the connivance between young Steve Kittredge, the 
developer's project director, and Kitty Thibault, president of mighty COOPPA, 
the Condominium Owners of Pembroke Pines Assn. 
</P>
<P>
One hand washes the other, and that's a dirty business, complains Arthur Zank: 
"If your window gets broken by a golf ball, try getting it fixed unless you're 
a friend of COOPPA's. Lots of luck to you without help from Kitty." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, is this a Kitty! Kitty Thibault, a.k.a. Goldilocks, is a fraction of a 
generation younger than most here. The dissidents describe her as having the 
demeanor of a cheerleader and the instincts of a ward healer. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait till you meet her," says Sol Shaffer. "Slick, like you wouldn't believe. 
She flutters her eyes at you, you'll think so, too." 
</P>
<P>
"A blond bombshell," says Sol's wife, Marlene. 
</P>
<P>
"She has more energy than any two or three people." 
</P>
<P>
"A blond bombshell." 
</P>
<P>
"Nasty, oh boy." 
</P>
<P>
"A blond bombshell." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Same Things, Over and Over' 
</P>
<P>
But first Steve Kittredge. 
</P>
<P>
The project director covers his face with his hand and then peeks out through 
fingers. "I cannot begin to tell you what it is like to manage one of these 
places," he says earnestly. "Same things, over and over and over." 
</P>
<P>
History repeats on him like a bad meal. Kittredge has worked at older Century 
Villages in other cities nearby and watched the politics take shape, 
predictable as an allergy attack, pesky as a canker sore. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, most people have had no experience with condo living. They 
don't realize that eventually developers move on and unit owners must govern 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the residents devise their own rules. They elect officers who then have 
to worry about the roofs and the catwalks, the water and the sewers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, most retirees want to be retired from such things. Who needs it? 
People treat you like a handyman. They call at 4 a.m. to demand you hear the 
drumbeat of their dripping faucet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jump Into Action 
</P>
<P>
But for some, the call to condo service is rousing as an anthem. They crave the 
action. What, are you going to spend all day at poolside, simmering in your own 
juices like a brisket of beef? 
</P>
<P>
True, condos are a complicated business. You're dealing with maintenance for 
the roads and buildings and such. That's why in 1985, the various Century 
Village associations combined their know-how under an umbrella group, COOPPA. 
</P>
<P>
In the glory days, COOPPA was combative as guerrillas in the hills. People were 
being overcharged by the developer for use of the clubhouse. COOPPA did its 
homework and nailed down the facts as airtight as canned goods. 
</P>
<P>
But no sooner had Steve Kittredge made peace with the rebels than a rival group 
sprang up, the We the People people. They have wrested away the support of at 
least four of the 16 governing condo associations. 
</P>
<P>
Please go get Kittredge some aspirin. "The yelling and the threatening," he 
says. "And this guy, Jack Newman, he never comes in to talk. First thing, he 
files lawsuits. He is, what do you call it, a litigious person." 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, Jack Newman is a retired clerk of the New York Supreme Court. But 
Kittredge does not know this. What he knows is: "The dissidents don't care 
about issues, really, just power. Some of them want to be as big as Kitty 
Thibault. Have you met Kitty?" 
</P>
<P>
Not yet, but it's hard not to sense her presence. Most of the dissidents were 
once Kitty's allies in COOPPA until, for one reason or another, they had 
fallings out, each a story elaborate as the plot of a coup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissidents Join Forces 
</P>
<P>
Then one day late last year, Arthur Zank and Sol Shaffer, never bedfellows 
before, met beside the pool and decided to rally the Outs against the Ins. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 12 or 15 people over for bagels and lox at my apartment," recalls Zank, 
retired from the shirt manufacturing business in New York. "Beautiful bagels 
and lox, really good nova, delicious." 
</P>
<P>
From that savory beginning came We the People, and, ever since, Century Village 
has been in a rift wide as the 7-10 split. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Association Fights Back 
</P>
<P>
COOPPA has its own newspaper for fighting back, four times the size of We the 
People. In the May issue, readers found a letter to the editor from Harriet 
Linar, who lives in Arthur Zank's building. She alleged: 
</P>
<P>
"I caught Arthur Zank on Feb. 14th at 7:30 p.m. shutting the light in the 
laundry room. He also lifted the cover of the washing machine while my laundry 
was in it, which, of course, stopped the machine from operating any further. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him 'Why?' He said, shaking his fingers in my face -- 'It costs money 
to keep the light on.' " 
</P>
<P>
Can such a thing be true? As it turns out, yes. Arthur himself remembers: "She 
asked me, 'How much can it cost?' I said, 'It's not a matter of how much. It's 
that you're spending other people's money!' " 
</P>
<P>
OK, right is right. But that's not the point. The revealing thing about the 
incident is that it happened two years ago, and the COOPPA News has reprinted 
the letter, by Harriet Linar's count, three times. Stop printing it! she pleads 
with them. Arthur and I get along fine now. 
</P>
<P>
Zank concurs. "This is typical of Kitty Thibault's tricks," he says. "Wait till 
you meet her. She talks down to you like a school teacher." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Evil, Sneaky' Person 
</P>
<P>
But it's much more than the speechifying, he says: "Over the years, she has 
become evil, sneaky, slimy, a person of half-truths and half lies," to say 
nothing of the fact that she has sued him for slander. 
</P>
<P>
So finally, as promised, here comes retired businesswoman Kitty Thibault, 
emerging from Steve Kittredge's office. She is a small, radiant woman, lovely 
in a summer dress. "Sour grapes and jealousy started all the trouble," she says 
sadly. 
</P>
<P>
There is the music of civic-mindedness in her voice. "In any political system, 
there is dissension, people nipping at your heels. But if you continue to help 
your fellow man, you'll always have more victories than defeats." 
</P>
<P>
This is just the oil, of course. Soon the conversation gets down to 
particulars, and Kitty serves up the vinegar as well. "There are people around 
here who've never accomplished anything in life and this is their last guttural 
gasp to make something of themselves," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they're not going to take over COOPPA. My shoes are big, and it'll take 
bigger feet than they've got to fill them. And I don't mind saying so!" 
</P>
<P>
She singles out Arthur Zank for special criticism, reciting his name as she 
might a serial killer's: "A spiteful man." Then, unburdened, she settles back 
into her best cheerleader's smile. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is Rancor Worth It? 
</P>
<P>
Ooh, my. This is some rhubarb. But is it really worth it? Is anything worth 
this rancor? And maybe the answer to that belongs to Sol Shaffer, who has a 
secret to share about condo politics. 
</P>
<P>
C'mere. "There is something an outsider doesn't really understand," he says, 
leaning close. "This is all fun. If it wasn't, it would drive you meshugge and 
you'd talk yourself into a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, it must be reported, Sol had a heart attack. "It was the 
stress," says his wife, Marlene. "If it wasn't one thing, it was another. Who 
needs this? I'm sorry we came here. It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Sol will be home in a few days. Thank you, yes, he is doing fine. 
And soon, Marlene says, he will get back into the rough-and-tumble of Century 
Village politics. She says, "We'll get them, if it's the last thing we do."

CHINA IMPOSES NEW CURBS ON TRAVEL ABROAD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China moved to restrict the exit of citizens who have already received 
permission to travel abroad, prompting a small run on foreign embassies today 
by Chinese seeking visas. 
</P>
<P>
Lines began forming at the U.S. Embassy here late Sunday night as word spread 
that the government had ordered Chinese who already have travel permits from 
their government to reapply for permission to leave. Many Chinese seemed to 
believe that obtaining a foreign visa might exempt them from the new rule. 
</P>
<P>
According to state radio and television broadcasts, citizens who have received 
travel documents will have to go back to the office where they were issued. 
Diplomatic observers viewed the rule as a means of blocking the exit of student 
activists placed on government blacklists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Easier to Identify' 
</P>
<P>
"By making people go back to the office where their exit permit was issued, it 
will be easier to identify people they don't want to leave the country," a 
Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known whether by obtaining a foreign visa, Chinese could avoid 
having to reapply to their own government for another exit permit. "It's not 
clear," said a schoolteacher from Henan province who lined up at the U.S. 
Embassy today. "I just don't want to take any chances." 
</P>
<P>
The tightening of travel may be in hopes of reducing Western influence in the 
country, some foreign observers said. China's conservative Communist leaders 
have blamed recent student unrest partly on Western influences. The government 
and army cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tian An Men Square 15 
days ago, leaving hundreds, perhaps thousands, dead and a wellspring of ill 
feelings in the capital and around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from the United States indicate that the hundreds of Chinese students 
living there may stay on rather than return home. 
</P>
<P>
China continued to attack the refuge given to dissident scientist Fang Lizhi 
and his wife, college professor Li Shuxian, by the American Embassy here. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the People's Daily, a government law expert declared that the 
asylum not only violates Chinese rules applicable to foreign diplomatic 
property but also international law. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is "obstructing China from exercising its power of criminal 
jurisdiction," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this not wanton interference in China's internal affairs?" the letter 
concluded, in an echo of the official government complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's state press reinforced reports Sunday that Politburo member 
Qiao Shi, a strong advocate of strict political control, is soon to be named 
Communist Party chief. 
</P>
<P>
The lead article in Sunday's edition of the People's Daily, the official party 
newspaper, reported that Qiao addressed leaders of "democratic parties," which 
are nominal political organizations from China's past. 
</P>
<P>
Such prominent display appeared to indicate that Qiao will succeed disgraced 
party head Zhao Ziyang, who fell from power after he showed sympathy for 
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tian An Men Square. Zhao, who is being blamed 
for "mistakenly" letting student demonstrators get out of hand, has not been 
heard from since April 19. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leaders are expected to meet soon to officially remove Zhao and 
name Qiao as Communist Party general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Qiao, the likely new Communist Party chief, is sometimes referred to by foreign 
observers as "Super Cop" because he has in recent years overseen both party 
discipline and China's vast police force. 
</P>
<P>
He is also reported to have directed the Communist Party's Investigation 
Department, a domestic intelligence-gathering unit. 
</P>
<P>
To the democratic parties, Qiao took a conciliatory line saying that "it is 
very natural that people have different views and doubts," given the prevailing 
"complicated" situation. 
</P>
<P>
During the recent months of political ferment, Qiao showed no signs of sympathy 
for the pro-democracy demonstrators. Nor has he displayed particular tolerance 
of advocates of quickened political or economic liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Western Solutions Assailed 
</P>
<P>
During a speech in March, he lashed out at party members who toyed with 
Western-style solutions to Chinese development problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can do well in promoting the building of the party," he said, "views and 
speeches which hold that reform means only economic privatization, that 
politically, only multi-party systems can be followed and that only wholesale 
Westernization can be implemented . . . will find less and less support." 
</P>
<P>
In words that now have an ominous ring, he added: "Demagoguery and instigation 
by several dissidents who have ulterior motives can never succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was one of the few in memory that Qiao had made on subjects of 
controversy within the party. Usually, he speaks out forcefully on corruption 
and the need to strengthen the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Caution has apparently served him well; his rise to prominence has been 
meteoric. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao nominated Qiao as one of China's five vice premiers in April, 1986. Just 
six months earlier, he had been named to the Communist Party's powerful 
Politburo as well as the Secretariat, the party's executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rapid Rise 
</P>
<P>
The rapid rise marked Qiao as a possible successor to then-Communist party 
chief Hu Yaobang, in part because he was seen as being dedicated to buttressing 
Communist Party rule. During the past decade of economic liberalization, the 
party's grip on the country was seen as weakening. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his appointment as vice premier, the official New China News 
Agency said: "Qiao's appointment indicates the intention of the Chinese 
government to give better guidance to the country's political and legal work." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Zhao, the 65-year-old Qiao has no experience in a major economic 
post, a shift in emphasis that may also signal greater attention to tighter 
political control. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Qiao has held two major jobs concerned with security. He has 
headed the Political and Legal Affairs Department of the Communist Party. That 
means he oversaw the country's Justice and Police Ministries, putting him in 
control of China's security forces, including the 500,000-member People's Armed 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enforcing Martial Law 
</P>
<P>
The green-clad Armed Police have joined soldiers in enforcing martial law in 
Beijing since the June 3-4 bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
Qiao has also headed the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee, which is 
responsible for punishing errant party members. In January, 1986, he headed a 
major drive against corruption in government. 
</P>
<P>
His links to top leader Deng Xiaoping go back at least to the early 1980s, when 
he was brought in to help Deng in reorganizing the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Qiao's security forces have been busy. Eleven death sentences have been 
announced for anti-government protesters charged with burning rail cars, buses 
and army vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The mayhem erupted after troops stormed central Beijing to roust demonstrators 
from Tian An Men Square.

I.F. STONE DIES; 'CONSCIENCE OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and JUDY PASTERNAK, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Author and journalist I.F. Stone, often dubbed "the conscience of investigative 
journalism," died at 81 of a heart attack in a Cambridge, Mass., hospital 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Stone published his first newspaper as a New Jersey schoolboy of 14 and 
proceeded to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted for the rest of 
his life. He worked for seven newspapers, was Washington correspondent for The 
Nation magazine and wrote 13 books. Although his politics were well to the left 
of center, Stone was best known for a conservative-looking four-page paper, The 
I.F. Stone Weekly, which he published with his wife, Esther, for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, he relearned Greek to research a book called "The Trial of 
Socrates," published to favorable reviews and sales last year. Afterward, the 
University of Pennsylvania dropout achieved a longtime ambition by being asked 
to lecture on Socrates at Harvard and several other leading universities. 
</P>
<P>
Stone was the subject of a documentary film, one biography and was called a 
"modern-day Tom Paine" by Amherst college historian Henry Steele Commager. 
Although Stone described himself as an independent radical, "the way he 
practiced journalism was conservative," said Tom Goldstein, dean of the UC 
Berkeley journalism school. Stone got the bulk of his stories by poring over a 
labyrinth of government documents and hearing transcripts that nobody else had 
the patience to wade through. 
</P>
<P>
Many admirers noted Sunday that Stone was ahead of public opinion on many 
issues, ranging from McCarthyism to the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"If you read him in the 1950s and the early 1960s, he was off the beaten track 
in many ways," said New York Times columnist Tom Wicker, who narrated a 1975 
documentary film about Stone's life. "Then the Vietnam War came along and it 
became apparent that the government didn't know what it was doing and would lie 
about it and he'd been saying that all along." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Man of Curiosity 
</P>
<P>
Stone's legendary curiosity about virtually any subject remained strong until 
the end, said his sister, Judy Stone, a San Francisco Chronicle film critic. "A 
few weeks ago, he came out of surgery and the first thing he asked the nurses 
after the anesthesia wore off was: 'What's going on in China.' " 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, he called his brother, Lou, in Philadelphia to tell him how 
pleased he was about interviews with Chinese dissidents that he had seen on the 
nightly news. In fact, he was ahead of the pack on this story too. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he was trying to draw attention to the emerging pro-democracy 
sentiment in China. On a drizzly day, he stood across from the White House in 
Lafayette Park and lit a candle in support of Chinese students. He had invited 
a Voice of America reporter and the ensuing radio story prompted official 
Chinese news agencies to denounce him. 
</P>
<P>
Stone looked like a scholar -- a 5-foot, 6-inch, 140-pound man who wore glasses 
with thick lenses and was often found tearing through newspapers and stuffing 
the scraps into a jacket pocket for future use. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a whole other side to Stone. Into his 80s, Stone was the last to 
leave a dinner party. He spent many Friday nights dancing with his wife to 
1960s rock 'n' roll at a Washington club called Deja Vu. He frequently walked 
four or five a miles day near his home in Washington, said a friend, columnist 
Cody Shearer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Reactions 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, he was a boyish man, not what you'd expect from someone who 
spent his life with documents," said Frances Fitzgerald, author of "Fire in the 
Lake," a highly acclaimed book about Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a tear in my eye," said longtime CBS producer and Columbia University 
journalism school dean Fred Friendly. "He was the conscience of investigative 
journalism." 
</P>
<P>
"He was the scholar of our profession," said James Reston, the former 
Washington bureau chief of the New York Times. And Jack Nelson, the Los Angeles 
Times' Washington bureau chief, said: "He was one of the great investigative 
reporters of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Even conservative author William Buckley praised Stone, although he was more 
measured in his appraisal. Buckley described Stone as an 
"intellectual-journalist-polemicist in confrontation with whom the 
establishment always needed to keep in fighting trim." But he criticized Stone 
for backing Progressive Party candidate Henry A. Wallace for President in 1948 
and for supporting Joseph Stalin in the 1930s and Ho Chi Minh in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Stone was born Isidor Feinstein in Philadelphia on Dec. 24, 1907. But in 1939, 
concerned with the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe and its possible growth in 
the United States, he formally changed his surname to Stone and became I.F. 
Stone. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy reporter in Camden, N.J., Stone saw himself as "a cross between 
Galahad and William Randolph Hearst, rescuing the poor and saving maidens in 
distress," he said in an interview in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting for the Philadelphia Record, the New York Post and The Nation 
magazine, he decried the rise of Fascism in Europe, exposed big business 
chicanery, denounced the treatment of migrant farm workers and criticized the 
Supreme Court for overturning New Deal reforms and for approving the blanket 
internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
He practiced what he preached. Stone gave up his membership in the National 
Press Club in 1941 when it refused to serve a black judge he took to lunch 
there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secret Assignment 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he wrote for three liberal weekly newspapers 
in New York -- PM, the Compass and the Star. On secret assignment for PM, he 
was the first journalist to accompany a group of Eastern European Jewish 
refugees who ran a British naval blockade to "the promised land" of Palestine. 
He expanded the PM articles into perhaps his most moving book, "Underground to 
Palestine," published in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
When the Star folded in 1952, he started his Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
Launched with a $10,000 loan from a New York businessman and Stone's $3,500 
severance pay from the Compass, the Weekly seemed to be starting at an 
unpropitious time. Many government officials were shuddering under attacks on 
their loyalty from Wisconsin's Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
At the start, he had 5,300 subscribers, including Albert Einstein. The price 
was $5 a year. He published weekly for 14 years and biweekly for another four 
after he developed heart problems. When he closed the paper in 1971, he had 
71,00 subscribers, including the Nixon White House. The price: still $5. 
</P>
<P>
Stone was branded a communist because of his criticisms of the Korean War and a 
host of other issues. He was an early critic of the Vietnam War and was never 
afraid to be controversial, even making some skeptical remarks about President 
John F. Kennedy's term in office amid the gush of praise after Kennedy's 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Izzy represents a unique force in American journalism," said Carl 
Bernstein, who had known Stone since his youth and who, with Washington Post 
reporter Bob Woodward, unearthed the Watergate scandal. "At a time when the 
herd instinct ran rampant in our profession, he almost alone remembered what 
being a real reporter was about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Stands 
</P>
<P>
For almost two decades, with self-described "maniacal zest and idiot zeal," 
Stone demonstrated the logic of halting the arms race. Long before it was safe 
to do so, he attacked McCarthyite loyalty purges. He probed the origins of the 
Korean War and made swiss cheese of the Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Stone urged the nation's presidents to devote more resources to 
problems in places like Selma, Ala., than in propping up what he considered 
corrupt regimes in Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
He reminded his friends on the Left of the consequences of thought control in 
Moscow. That cost him subscribers. He pleaded for justice for Palestinian as 
well as Jewish refugees. That cost him subscribers too. 
</P>
<P>
But his independent stance on the issue also won him admirers. "He was often 
cast into the role of a critic because he recognized that this land was meant 
to be shared by two peoples -- the Jews and the Palestinians," said Leonard 
Beerman, founding rabbi of Leo Baeck Temple in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Stone is likely to be best remembered as a reporter who asked questions that 
others didn't think of, poring over documents that others found too obtuse and 
scoring scoops on a shoestring budget. 
</P>
<P>
One of the exclusives he was most proud of was a 1958 story exposing how the 
Atomic Energy Commission had lied about how far from a test site an underground 
nuclear blast could be detected. The question of distance was critical in 
determing whether the test ban treaty was being monitored. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vietnam War Issue 
</P>
<P>
But the issue that brought him widespread attention of many people, 
particularly students, was Vietnam. He spoke at the first Vietnam teach-in at 
Berkeley in 1965 and at the massive march on the Pentagon in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
One of his most moving and briefest pieces on the war, written in February, 
1967, was entitled "More Than Steel and Chrome Could Bear." 
</P>
<P>
Stone asserted that "everything America stands for" and "everything the modern 
world (both capitalist and communist) admires" was at stake in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the Machine, it is the prestige of the Machine that is at stake in 
Vietnam. It is Boeing and General Electric and Goodyear and General Dynamics. 
It is the electronic range finder and the amphibious truck and the 
night-piercing radar. It is the defoliant, and the herbicide, and the 
deodorant, and the depilatory. It is the products and the brand names we have 
been conditioned since childhood to revere. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Down there in the jungles, unregenerate, ingenious, tricky, as tiny as a louse 
or a termite, and as hard to get at, emerged a strange creature whose potency 
we had almost forgotten -- Man. To sit down now and deal with him is to admit 
that the Machine is lost to Man, that our beautifully computerized war, with 
the most complicated devices for killing ever assembled and the most 
overwhelming firepower ever mustered has failed." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, sister and brother, Stone is survived by a daughter, 
Celia Gilbert, a poet; two sons, Jeremy Stone, president of the American 
Federation of Scientists, and Christopher Stone, a law professor at USC, and 
four grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are pending.

<TEXT>
<P>
Controversial Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou lost control of Parliament in 
national elections here Sunday, but conservative challengers apparently fell 
short in their bid to force him from office. 
</P>
<P>
While the rebuff to Papandreou after eight years of hard-sell socialism had 
been expected, the seeming failure by conservatives to win a parliamentary 
majority triggered uncertainty and concern about the Greek political future. 
</P>
<P>
Under a full moon that hung as if painted above the majestic Acropolis, tens of 
thousands of voters streamed through election-dazzled Athens in honking 
procession early today, although the makeup of their new government remained in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
With 53% of the vote counted, official nationwide returns gave the New 
Democracy Party of 70-year-old lawyer Constantine Mitsotakis 45.2% from 7.4 
million eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, called PASOK, ran an expected 
second with 38.5%. A coalition of Communists and leftist had 12.8%, with the 
remaining votes divided among a clutch of minor parties. 
</P>
<P>
"New Democracy cannot form a government because there is a progressive majority 
in Parliament," Papandreou told supporters in the wee hours this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to his supporters, Mitsotakis said voters have "condemned the 
government of scandals and corruption. Mr. Papandreou has rushed to prejudge 
the final results. I'm waiting to see if we can form a self-sufficient 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Pre-election estimates set 47% as the threshold for a Mitsotakis majority, but 
party spokesman Panayotis Lambrias said New Democracy projections showed 
victory with at least 151 seats in the 300-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
However, computer projections broadcast by state television gave New Democracy 
147 seats to 124 for PASOK. The Communists had 29. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Greek constitution, President Christos Sartzetakis must ask the 
leader of the party that finishes first to form a government, in this case 
Mitsotakis. If he is unable to do so, it would become Papandreou's turn to try. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou held a narrow majority in the outgoing Parliament. A victory by 
Mitsotakis without a majority would leave open the possibility of Papandreou's 
continuing in power with the active or tacit support of the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's voting in a mountainous, heavily agricultural nation of 11 million was 
as orderly as the election campaign had been noisy with allegation and 
innuendo. With structural political and economic issues sounding only minor 
keys in the campaign, Mitsotakis made Papandreou the decisive issue. 
</P>
<P>
Promising moral and political "catharsis" to purge a discredited system, 
Mitsotakis hammered at unprecedented financial scandals that have shaken Greece 
under Papandreou, and at the 70-year-old prime minister's front-page love 
affair with a former airline flight attendant half his age. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen government and party officials, including two of the prime 
minister's closest associates, have been jailed or are under investigation in 
embezzlement and procurement scandals involving hundreds of millions of dollars 
in state funds. 
</P>
<P>
Proclaiming his own innocence, Papandreou accused the United States of trying 
to topple him. In emotional campaign appeals, the charismatic Papandreou 
defended the social record of a free-spending government that has improved 
living standards of workers and farmers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, a former UC Berkeley economics professor first elected in 1981, was 
returned to office in 1985 with 45.8% of the vote. New Democracy won 40.8% then 
and the Communists 11.7% in a nation where political life is marked by 
lingering left-right divisions. 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast to Papandreou's aggressive and personalistic socialism, New 
Democracy campaigned for a greater reliance on a market economy and an 
unabashedly pro-American foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis promised to reduce Papandreou-directed frictions between Greece and 
its partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European 
Community, saying in a New Democracy platform statement that the party "regards 
U.S. military bases in Greece as crucial for Greece's own defense and favors 
closer trade and economic relations with the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Prolonged and stressful negotiations with the Papandreou government to renew 
the leases of four American air and naval bases were unavailing. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, has the Greek government thus far failed to honor a court decree 
authorizing the extradition of a Palestinian terrorist wanted by the United 
States for the 1985 bombing on a Pan Am jet flying near Hawaii that killed a 
Japanese teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing American concern about Papandreou's inability -- or unwillingness -- to 
crack down on Arab terrorists who have often found safe harbor in Greece, 
Mitsotakis promised "a strengthening of European and international cooperation 
to combat terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1918 in the town of Chania on the island of Crete, the bland Mitsotakis 
has a reputation of being better on directions than details. Lacking 
Papandreou's popular magnetism, he is described as more effective in private 
than in public: a mediocre public speaker, but a man who puts in long hours at 
his desk without complaint. His foreign languages include German, English and 
excellent French polished during years of political exile in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
A politician nearly all of his adult life, Mitsotakis has served in 11 
parliaments since 1948. His campaign biography describes Mitsotakis, who is a 
graduate in law and economics from the University of Athens, as a Resistance 
fighter against German forces occupying Crete during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis, who lives in a comfortable suburban home uncomfortably close to one 
of the runways at Athens' International Airport, is nicknamed O Psilos -- the 
tall man -- by his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Until a split in 1965 that has colored Greek political life ever since, 
Mitsotakis was a follower of Prime Minister Georges Papandreou, father of the 
man he faced Sunday. He went into French exile when the Greek armed forces 
seized power in 1967, returning after democratic government was restored in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
A minister of economy in the conservative government of Prime Minister 
Constantine Karamanlis from 1978-80, and foreign minister in 1980-81, 
Mitsotakis became president of New Democracy in 1984. He was beaten by 
Papandreou in his first run for the prime ministry the next year.

BUSINESSMAN TELLS OF PAYING $20,000 FOR MONTOYA'S HELP

<TEXT>
<P>
A Colorado businessman said Sunday he had to pay $20,000 to win passage of a 
bill authored by state Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier) and also to pay for 
lavish lunches and a hotel room for a Montoya aide and a "lady friend." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Kerns of Ft. Collins said he later ran out of money and refused to pay a 
$1,500 monthly retainer to Fred Shanbour, a lobbyist recommended by Montoya. As 
a result, he said, the law he wanted passed is now due to expire in the next 
two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
Kerns and his business partner, C.H. Carter, were flown to Sacramento at 
government expense and interviewed for more than three hours Friday by an FBI 
agent and federal prosecutor investigating Montoya and his relationship to 
various lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service is also participating in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, chairman of the Senate Business and Professions Committee, and a 
former top aide, Amiel Jaramillo, were indicted May 17 on 12 counts of 
racketeering, extortion and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
They have pleaded innocent. Their attorneys were unavailable Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a game out there," Kerns said in a telephone interview from his 
home. "It stinks. I thought we were doing what we had to do legally. We were 
told we had to do things for people to show some token of good faith. I didn't 
think it was right to hold a gun to our head." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Panneton, who is working on the investigation, 
declined to comment. "We don't talk about matters until they are in court," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Kerns said, he attended a legislative hearing on his bill in San 
Francisco. Shanbour "suggested highly we pick up the tab for lunch as good 
will" for Montoya and his staff, he said, adding that he was shocked by a bill 
that came to several hundred dollars, as his seven luncheon guests ordered 
lavishly. 
</P>
<P>
Kerns also said he paid, at Shanbour's suggestion, for a room at a swank San 
Francisco hotel for a Montoya aide and what he called a "lady friend." 
</P>
<P>
Kerns and Carter were among a group that operated International Hair Runner 
Inc., which wanted to sell motor homes converted to beauty shops to serve 
elderly and handicapped customers unable to travel to a conventional shop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advice From Board 
</P>
<P>
The state Board of Cosmetology told him he needed a law to allow his mobile 
beauty shops to operate in California. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wrote to every legislator seeking an author. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo responded in a phone call, Kerns said, and he flew to Sacramento to 
meet Montoya, who immediately told him to hire a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I knew this lobbyist was sitting in the office," Kerns said, 
describing his introduction to Shanbour. 
</P>
<P>
He said Shanbour told him over coffee in the Capitol cafeteria he was the only 
lobbyist who could guarantee passage of the bill. Later, at a cosmetology board 
meeting in Monterey, Shanbour asked him for $25,000 for his services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money for Contributions 
</P>
<P>
Kerns said he later negotiated a $15,000 fee. He said Shanbour also wanted 
$5,000 in cash to be distributed in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Kerns said he balked at paying cash. He wrote $3,900 in checks, which was 
distributed to 13 lawmakers, including Montoya, as campaign contributions and 
paid Shanbour another $1,100 in currency for what Shanbour called "extra 
expenses." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened to that money, or who got it," Kerns said. 
</P>
<P>
Shanbour, reached at his Fountain Valley home, corroborated the amounts stated 
by Kerns, but he insisted everything was handled legally. 
</P>
<P>
"I never, never, never took any cash, period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not remember suggesting that Kerns pay for a hotel room for a 
Montoya aide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List of Lobbyists 
</P>
<P>
Shanbour also said he understood that Montoya had given Kerns a list of three 
lobbyists from which to choose, including himself and David Kim. He said he met 
Kerns during his initial trip to Sacramento because he happened to be in 
Montoya's office on another matter. 
</P>
<P>
The $1,100, Shanbour said, was given to him in the form of a check and was to 
pay his son for "leg work" on Kerns' bill. 
</P>
<P>
Kerns said his bill sailed smoothly through the Senate without a negative vote, 
but ran into some trouble in the Assembly. It finally won passage with an 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Kerns said, he and his partners had run out of money, largely 
because of the expense of winning passage of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
He said he refused Shanbour's request for a $1,500 monthly retainer to watch 
legislative activity that might affect his business. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he learned his motor home beauty salon law, won with $20,000 in lobbying 
fees and campaign contributions, will expire under what legislators call a 
sunset provision. 
</P>
<P>
Kerns said he helped with passage of laws and regulations in 13 states "without 
any hassles. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the law amended in Colorado and I didn't need no senator and I didn't 
need no lobbyist," Kerns said. "They realized it was the correct thing to do."

A 4-year-old who shot himself while playing with a gun a week ago has become 
the third Florida child to die in a recent spate of accidents involving 
handguns kept in the home. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Silvio Claud Pierre, died Saturday night in Tampa General Hospital 
after undergoing seven hours of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Florida legislators this week are to consider a bill that would make it a 
misdemeanor to leave a firearm in a place accessible to a child. If a child 
died or was permanently disfigured in a case involving negligence, the offense 
would be a felony with a maximum five-year prison term.

AMERICAN ALBUM: GROWN-UP NEW YORKERS ARE TAKING UP SCHOOLYARD STICKBALL AS AN 
ANTIDOTE TO URBAN TENSION.

<P>
Drenching rain had fallen the night before, and a huge puddle covered half the 
infield as the players climbed through a hole in the wire fence into the 
schoolyard in mid-Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The star home run hitter, a lawyer, was absent because he was stuck in the 
office with a temporary restraining order. But Jeb, half Labrador retriever, 
served as substitute fielder, frolicking in the water as the warm-up for the 
big game began. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Beer reared back on the pitcher's mound, an uneven box he had drawn in 
chalk between two old chewing gum spots on the asphalt. He fired his first 
pitch to David Pliskin, who waited, thin bat cocked, in front of the strike 
zone painted on the school wall. 
</P>
<P>
Strike! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plastic Palm Trees 
</P>
<P>
"In August, we bring out some plastic palm trees. You see the Sangria des 
Townhouse Mountains back there," said Pliskin, a real estate manager, pointing 
to a row of multicolored townhouses beyond the center field fence. "This is the 
Chavez Ravine of the East." 
</P>
<P>
"Quotable! quotable!" kibitzed Beer, a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the return of stickball in New York City. The game of choice of 
generations of youngsters, stickball -- a cheap version of baseball -- had 
fallen on hard times, a victim of suburban flight, urban blight, unremitting 
traffic, general overcrowding and cultural change. Now the game is staging a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Athletic League, which sponsors recreational activities in poor 
neighborhoods, is planning a three-sewer stickball derby this summer, to see if 
strong kids can still belt a ball the distance of three sewers (three manhole 
covers, or about 300 feet). For the last six years, Budweiser beer has 
sponsored an old-timers' stickball day in Manhattan, when a street is closed 
and the game is played as it used to be. The company also hosts a world series 
of stickball on another block. 
</P>
<P>
Grownups can remember playing stickball after school and standing, broomstick 
cocked, on the street behind a manhole cover that served as home plate, trying 
to smash into infinity a small, pink rubber ball nicknamed Spaldeen. Car 
fenders and other manhole covers served as bases. For a brief, shining moment, 
ordinary kids were Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle or Duke Snider. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of Growing Up 
</P>
<P>
Stickball was more than a game; it was a way station on the road to 
self-identity. 
</P>
<P>
"It meant camaraderie, acceptance, proving something to one's self," said Dr. 
David Brook, a Manhattan psychiatrist who grew up playing stickball in the 
Bronx -- and who fantasized about hitting five sewers. 
</P>
<P>
These days, young professionals are taking up stickball as an antidote to urban 
tension. Some old-time purists scoff at the idea of playing stickball in 
schoolyards, but discretion in the face of New York's fierce traffic is the 
better part of valor. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, on a recent Saturday, Beer, Pliskin and Mark Thomas, a soft- drink 
distributor, all 29-year-olds, warmed up with a tennis ball for their 
encounter. (The Spalding Co. stopped manufacturing the pink ball several years 
ago.) They were joined by Jane Jacobs, a benefits consultant with a bright 
smile and a level swing who grew up playing softball in Solomon, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
"Jane saw us playing and she asked if she could get up at bat," said Beer. "She 
started hitting them against the fence. She is really good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Late Arrival 
</P>
<P>
Just as the game was about to begin, Bill Sullivan, 30, arrived fresh from 
wrestling with the restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
He and Pliskin took on the others. (As few as two can play very basic stickball 
-- a pitcher and a batter.) 
</P>
<P>
The contest was close. Jacobs hit a home run, as did Pliskin. The score was 3 
to 3 in the final inning. On the sideline, Cy Beer, a jeans manufacturer, 
cheered for his son and reminisced about playing the game on the streets of 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great. It was a way to relieve the tension of growing up in a crowded 
house," he said. "We were able to get out in the fresh air and develop 
relationships. Some of the friends I am still friends with today. We did not 
have time to get involved in bad things. We were busy playing ball." 
</P>
<P>
For just a moment, Beer's memory spanned the stickball generation gap as he 
imagined himself back at the plate. He said: "I look in the mirror and I see 
this man staring back at me. He looks familiar, but he isn't me." 
</P>
<P>
In the last inning Thomas came to bat. He took a pitch, then another, then 
smashed a long home run -- the winning run -- over the schoolyard fence. As he 
crossed home plate his teammates gave him the high five. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New York Tradition 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, street stickball was a New York City sport. Jonas Halpern, a 
business consultant, played on streets near Coney Island in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great game. You could play it for hours," he said. "We would always 
name ourselves after baseball teams. You were either the Giants or the Dodgers 
or the Yankees. The only problem was some kids would take their moms' brooms 
and chop them up, and their moms would scream." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Halpern moved West. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw another stickball game when I went to Southern California," he 
said. "Most of the homes of the kids I knew had vacuum cleaners. You couldn't 
hit with a vacuum cleaner."

RUSHDIE INTERVIEW NOT NEW, WRITER SAYS

An interview with author Salman Rushdie billed by a British newspaper as his 
first since going into hiding four months ago was actually given last December, 
long before Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death, its author 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to apologize to Salman because of course I hadn't realized it 
would be so sensationalized," New York-based writer Ameena Meer said. 
</P>
<P>
The British newspaper Mail on Sunday published the interview with Rushdie, 
claiming it was his first since last February, when Khomeini called on Muslims 
to kill him for allegedly blaspheming Islam with his novel "The Satanic 
Verses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interview Was Last December 
</P>
<P>
Meer said she interviewed Rushdie last Christmas Eve for the New York-based 
literary magazine Bomb and that her article was in the spring edition, 
published in March. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, the death threat wasn't so serious," Meer said. "The ayatollah 
hadn't issued a death threat. (Rushdie) had just received death threats from 
Muslims in England. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite horrible, and actually a reporter had called me from the Mail to 
ask me when it was done, to ask me more details about it, and she should have 
had the real story," Meer said. 
</P>
<P>
"They completely distorted it," said Bomb editor Betsy Sussler. "It's absurd. 
It was done long before (Rushdie) went into hiding." 
</P>
<P>
She said the interview was sold on Meer's behalf to the Mail about two weeks 
ago for about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in a statement issued through his agents, Rushdie said: "The Mail on 
Sunday's claim that I have 'broken my silence' and given them a new interview 
is wholly false and, in the present situation, highly irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lurid' Version 
</P>
<P>
He said Mail's story was a "lurid and sensationalized" version of an interview 
he gave long before Khomeini's death threat. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "The Mail on Sunday should now admit their deception. I shall be 
taking legal advice." 
</P>
<P>
But the Mail on Sunday defended its claim that the interview was given by 
Rushdie after Khomeini, who died June 3, called for his death. 
</P>
<P>
"The article makes it clear that Mr. Rushdie chose to give the interview to a 
young Indian journalist after the late Ayatollah Khomeini's call for his 
execution," a spokesman for the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the interview had been "recently published abroad" but said it 
was the first to appear in Britain since February.

The interview quoted the Indian-born British author as calling Iran's 1979 
Islamic Revolution a force for evil.

It also quoted him as saying he was saddened by the ban on his novel in many 
Muslim countries. "They're willing to say things about my work which are not 
based on reading," he said in the interview, "but gradually the book will be

CHINA PROTEST MARCH DRAWS 1,500 IN L.A. 
</P>

In one of the largest demonstrations of its kind in Los Angeles, more than a 
thousand people marched in summer-like heat to the Chinese Consulate on Sunday 
to protest the continuing suppression of pro-democracy students in China. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its size, what made this march different from past demonstrations was 
evidence that the protest is becoming a broad-based community movement, leaders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-march rally at MacArthur Park resembled a political convention, with 
brightly colored signs announcing the presence of such diverse groups as the 
San Fernando Valley Chinese Cultural Assn., the Thousand Oaks Council of the 
Chinese Cultural Assn. and the Libertarian Party. Altogether, there were more 
than 150 organizations represented. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest gathering so far in Southern California," said Changqing 
Cao, a Chinese journalist studying in the United States. "We should set aside 
June 18 as a special day." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police estimated the size of the crowd at 1,500, although Chinese 
community leaders released estimates more than twice as large. 
</P>
<P>
The featured speaker was Tong Boning, a student who returned to China when the 
pro-democracy demonstrations began, then was detained briefly by the government 
when he tried to leave after the June 3-4 massacre in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
To those who wondered why the government had released him, he explained that 
"they wanted me to send a strong message to the people in the United States." 
That message, he said, is that Chinese students here should be careful; anyone 
who believes "just because you are in the U.S. that you are safe (should know 
that) we are watching you." 
</P>
<P>
To a cacophony of honking horns on Wilshire Boulevard, the crowd marched to the 
consulate to deliver a protest letter. 
</P>
<P>
"As overseas Chinese and citizens of the world, we strongly denounce such 
uncivilized actions by your government," it read.

House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) expressed outrage Sunday over the 
Chinese government's attempt to deny that a mass slaughter of Chinese civilians 
took place at Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Foley also condemned the death sentences given to eight people accused of 
attacking the Chinese army during the June 4 crackdown on the pro-democracy 
movement in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are outraged as a country about the death sentences, about the suppression 
and about the enormous big lie that the Chinese government is attempting to 
tell about that story," Foley said on NBC's "Meet The Press." 
</P>
<P>
Foley said he believes that President Bush should be more vocal in his 
criticism of the Chinese leadership and consider further actions against the 
Beijing government "if matters turn toward the worse, as they apparently are 
doing."

MEDICARE REFORM NEEDED TO CURB RISING COSTS, SULLIVAN TELLS AMA

<P>
The nation's health chief told the American Medical Assn. on Sunday that a 
Medicare reform plan strongly opposed by the group is a solution to 
skyrocketing medical costs and lack of access to quality care. 
</P>
<P>
Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, 
said that such solutions are better than a total overhaul of the system. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. per capita expenditures for health care are the highest in the world, 
consuming more than 11% of the country's gross national product, "and they 
continue to rise at an unsustainable rate," Sullivan told more than 1,000 
physicians on the opening day of the AMA's five-day policy-making session. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lags in Health Indices 
</P>
<P>
"Yet the United States lags far behind other industrialized countries in some 
basic health indices, including average life expectancy and maternal 
mortality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan told reporters afterward that he had reiterated the Bush 
Administration's support for "expenditure targets" during a meeting with the 
AMA's Board of Trustees earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, aimed at curbing increasing fees by doctors who treat 
Medicare patients, the government would set maximum levels for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James H. Sammons, the association's executive vice president, called the 
proposal "rationing" of medical care in a speech to members later Sunday and 
said he has "personally communicated the medical profession's objections" to 
the White House and to Sullivan.

11-YEAR-OLD PILOT LANDS IN OSLO AFTER 6-HOUR ATLANTIC CROSSING

Unseasonably warm weather greeted 11-year-old Tony Aliengena after he conquered 
the North Atlantic and made a European landfall here Sunday on his quest to fly 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano aviator glided to a picture-perfect landing at Oslo's 
Fornebu Airport, ending a tedious, six-hour flight from Reykjavik, Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the cockpit of his single-engined Cessna, Tony was mobbed by 
Norwegian news reporters and photographers, who asked him to pose by his plane. 
</P>
<P>
Then without having to show a passport or clear customs, Tony and his entourage 
of eight were shuttled to a suburban Oslo Hotel, stopping along the way for a 
look at Norway's Royal Palace, home of King Olav IV. 
</P>
<P>
On the drive, they saw scores of picnicking families and bicyclists brought out 
by the 80-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
Oslo's heat wave, not unlike temperatures in his native California, came as a 
welcome respite from the bitter cold that Tony experienced during his 
2,500-mile journey across the north Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
"No sweat," Tony said of the treacherous crossing. "It was a piece of cake."

DISNEY-STEINBERG 'GREENMAIL' TRIAL NEARS OPENING DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time in 1984, the corporate guardians of Mickey Mouse and his 
friends were besieged by a scary raider. After he huffed and puffed at their 
house, they gave him $59 million to go away. But some stockholders cried 
"Greenmail!" and filed lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The tale of Saul J. Steinberg and his $325-million tender offer for 49% of Walt 
Disney Co. is now about to be dissected in a Los Angeles civil trial. 
Defendants accused of breach of fiduciary duty and other violations of 
California law include Steinberg, Disney Co. and 11 people who were directors 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Other defendants include Steinberg's financial adviser in the deal, Drexel 
Burnham Lambert, and Disney's investment banker, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., both 
New York firms. Drexel's Beverly Hills "junk bond" office also worked for 
Steinberg on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
A class-action suit on behalf of an estimated 60,000 Disney stockholders -- who 
lost money selling their shares on a depressed market -- seeks the money that 
Steinberg gained from his deal. While held by court order in a special fund the 
past five years, the $59 million has grown to about $100 million with interest. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs refer to the Disney buyout of Steinberg as greenmail, a term often 
used when a company buys a major block of its stock from a raider -- paying him 
a premium price to avoid being taken over. 
</P>
<P>
Among the prominent names that figure in the cast of the Disney-Steinberg 
events in June, 1984, are those of junk bond wizard Michael Milken and 
movie-and-casino magnate Kirk Kerkorian. Neither are defendants, but their 
roles are expected to be discussed in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian was a Steinberg ally who had an option to buy Disney's film 
production business for $447.5 million if Steinberg won control of the company 
with his tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who was involved in Drexel's financing for Steinberg, is facing 
unrelated federal criminal charges of racketeering and securities law 
violations in a major Wall Street insider trading scandal. 
</P>
<P>
As much as plaintiffs would like to question Milken on the witness stand, the 
chances appeared dim. Defense attorneys said in court Friday that they were 
informed that when Milken appears Tuesday in New York under subpoena by the 
plaintiffs for his deposition, he will exercise his Fifth Amendment right 
against self-incrimination by declining to answer all substantive questions in 
the Disney-Steinberg case. 
</P>
<P>
If that occurs, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Abby Soven assured 
defense lawyers Friday, she will not allow plaintiffs to summon Milken as a 
witness in the trial just to exercise his constitutional right to remain 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
She also served notice that references to the criminal cases against Milken and 
Drexel would not be permitted before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the limelight of a public trial of the greenmail allegations were 
likely to increase the discomfort index for many involved. 
</P>
<P>
Disney directors named defendants include Ronald W. Miller, former president 
and chief executive, who was a son-in-law of company founder Walt Disney. 
Miller resigned three months after the company bought Steinberg's stock for 
$325 million, well above the market value at that time, and the company's stock 
price fell sharply after Steinberg withdrew his offer. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney stock has soared in value in the past several years with the film 
profits under the management of Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief 
executive, who followed the Miller regime. Since 1986, Disney went from No. 3 
to No. 1 movie company in its share of domestic box-office revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Defendants 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg's uncompleted tender offer for Disney stock in 1984 was for $72.50 
per share. Lawyers for defendant Disney directors assert that the market value 
of a Disney share held in 1984 "now exceeds $370 and continues to climb." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Miller, past and present Disney directors who are defendants in the 
civil case are former Chairman Raymond L. Watson, Richard A. Nunis, E. Cardon 
Walker, Robert H. B. Baldwin, Caroline Leonetti Ahmanson, Philip M. Hawley, 
Ignacio E. Lozano Jr., Samuel L. Williams, Donn B. Tatum and Charles E. Cobb 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The name of Roy E. Disney, a nephew of Walt Disney, also has been injected into 
the pretrial proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorney J. Michael Hennigan told Judge 
Soven on Friday that Milken's personal relationship with Roy Disney, and 
subsequently with Steinberg, marked the beginning of Steinberg's move against 
the Disney company. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Disney, who held a major interest in the firm, resigned as a company 
director in March, 1984, amid rumors he was considering a takeover effort. 
Shortly afterward, Steinberg disclosed a 6.3% holding in Disney stock, which 
later was doubled. Roy Disney said at the time of the tender offer that he was 
not part of Steinberg's group. Eleven days after Steinberg's stock was 
purchased by the company, Roy Disney rejoined the board. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual aspect of the case is that it involves a simultaneous trial of two 
lawsuits with conflicting goals. The suits were consolidated because they 
involve the same set of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In the class action, some Disney shareholders -- alleging breaches in fiduciary 
duty by the company's directors, by Steinberg and by some of the New York 
raider's advisers -- claim the Steinberg profit fund because they lost money 
when they sold their stock after the price collapsed following the buyout of 
Steinberg's interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lengthy Maneuvering 
</P>
<P>
However, in a so-called derivative suit on behalf of the Disney company, other 
Disney stockholders assert that the money should go to the movie company. 
</P>
<P>
For five years, the case has been the subject of pretrial maneuvering. In 
recent weeks, under rules of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the parties 
held mandatory settlement talks but failed to settle the dispute. The case has 
now been assigned for trial, with jury selection expected to start Wednesday. 
Lawyers estimate the trial may run for nine weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Some 20 lawyers crowded into the courtroom late last week to start preliminary 
proceedings. Judge Soven noted that she had no prior knowledge that the case 
was being assigned and that she had "12 feet" of records piled in her office. 
Then she began a process of dealing with a host of pretrial motions. 
</P>
<P>
After the jury is picked, the members will start hearing the parties' opening 
statements about the case. Besides alleging that all defendants breached a 
fiduciary duty to the Disney shareholders, the plaintiffs contend that 
Steinberg, his Reliance Insurance Co. and related companies and Drexel 
illegally "aided and abetted" the defendant Disney directors in the alleged 
breach. The Steinberg defendants, as well as the Disney group, assert that the 
Disney board's actions were fair to the company and its stockholders and that 
its judgments were protected by state law. 
</P>
<P>
However, attorneys for the Steinberg group contend that if the court upholds 
the claims against them, the group is entitled to a judgment against the Disney 
company for its loss.

WARNER CHIEF WOULD RECEIVE $180 MILLION IN NEW TIME DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warner Communications Chairman Steven J. Ross will get a windfall of $55 
million if Time Inc. succeeds in acquiring the entertainment giant for $14 
billion rather than proceeding with the originally proposed merger through a 
stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
If Time buys Warner for the proposed $70 a share, Ross stands to receive $180 
million for his holdings in the company. That compares to the $125 million that 
Ross stood to make under the earlier stock-swap deal. 
</P>
<P>
The calculation emerged over the weekend as analysts more closely scrutinized 
the deal. Separately, Time disclosed more information about deliberations in 
the nine days leading up to the acquisition proposal that was prompted by 
Paramount Communications' hostile bid to purchase Time. 
</P>
<P>
Time and Warner first proposed a merger in early March that would create the 
world's largest media and entertainment company. Time owns such notable 
magazines as People, Money and Sports Illustrated as well as the nation's 
second largest cable television company and the Home Box Office pay-television 
company. Warner owns cable TV systems in addition to its namesake motion 
picture studio and the industry's most profitable recorded music business. 
</P>
<P>
Warner spokesman Geoffrey W. Holmes confirmed the $180-million calculation for 
Ross' holdings, but noted that Ross' annual compensation will be lower in the 
years following the merger because the new deal requires Time to assume so much 
debt. Ross and other top executives already had agreed to peg their bonuses to 
the combined companies' pre-tax earnings, which is a sum derived after interest 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
If the new Time-Warner merger is completed, Ross probably will receive about 
$80 million in a lump-sum payment, with the remaining $100 million paid out 
over almost eight years, Holmes said. The Warner spokesman underscored the fact 
that Ross' actual employment contract hasn't been changed. 
</P>
<P>
In a document filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Time disclosed a 
number of the options presented to its 12-member board before the directors 
unanimously rejected Paramount's offer and voted to bid for Warner. 
</P>
<P>
But just in case the merger with Warner is not consummated, Time has asked its 
financial and legal advisers "to continue to explore the feasibility and 
desirability of various . . . courses of action," including the options 
outlined last week. 
</P>
<P>
Those options ranged from a bid for Paramount, or certain other unidentified 
companies, to various restructuring plans for Time itself. A financial 
restructuring might include payment of a substantial dividend to Time 
shareholders, or Time might repurchase its own shares. Yet another alternative 
would be to place Time's businesses in a joint venture with a third party, the 
document said. 
</P>
<P>
Time also disclosed payment of $6 million each to its financial advisers, with 
another $10 million payment due to each by Feb. 14, 1990. The two firms are 
Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. and and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Time said in the filing that its 82%-owned cable TV company, American 
Television and Communications Corp., filed suit Friday against Paramount in 
Connecticut. The cable TV company alleged that it might be forced to breach 
some of its cable franchising and financial agreements if Paramount completes 
its tender offer for Time before obtaining certain governmental approvals.

CRAIG MCCAW: CELLULAR TELEPHONE INDUSTRY GIANT SHUNS THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent editions of "Who's Who in the West" and "Who's Who of Emerging Leaders 
In America" describe the achievements of a son of the late J. Elroy McCaw, a 
Seattle entrepreneur who built a communications empire. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, though, the listing is for Elroy's first-born son, an insurance 
executive, and not Craig O. McCaw, the second son, who has jolted the big 
regional phone companies by becoming the undisputed leader of the hot new 
cellular telephone industry. After starting out with a small cable television 
concern inherited by the four McCaw sons, 39-year-old Craig McCaw has led the 
way into building Kirkland, Wash.,-based McCaw Cellular Communications into the 
nation's largest cellular company. 
</P>
<P>
The "Who's Who" omission reflects McCaw's almost reclusive style. Despite his 
role as an industry powerhouse, he is little-known outside of the cellular 
business. 
</P>
<P>
He rarely grants interviews and declined to be interviewed or photographed for 
this story. In fact, McCaw has asked other people not to discuss his family 
with reporters. His photograph has never been in the company's annual reports. 
"We ap proach our work with humility and determination to achieve excellence," 
McCaw said in the 1988 chairman's letter. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a corporate giant appears to be a major goal, too. On June 6, McCaw 
Cellular proposed a $5.8-billion tender offer for the 91% of New York-based Lin 
Broadcasting that McCaw Cellular doesn't already own. The acquisition would 
give the company, among other things, Lin's important 35% stake in Los Angeles 
Cellular Telephone Co. and cement its No. 1 position in an industry some 
believe will eventually rival traditional phone service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Principle Passion 
</P>
<P>
When McCaw emerges in public, it is usually to sing the praises of the cellular 
industry. "He is a very good speaker. He's very knowledgeable about the 
industry," said Robert W. Maher, president of the Cellular Telephone Industry 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great believer in this industry. He is very confident that this is a 
good business and that there is potential growth to make this a very big 
industry," Maher added. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas W. Friedberg, a Seattle-based telecommunications analyst for Piper 
Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, said the cellular business is McCaw's "principal and 
consuming interest." 
</P>
<P>
McCaw's other passions are yachting and flying, according to associates. He 
lives near Seattle's Lake Washington and frequently pilots a seaplane and a 
Lear jet. 
</P>
<P>
Known as an extremely aggressive and tough competitor, McCaw is also said to be 
likable, though quiet, socially. "I think he is a very bright and engaging 
person. I enjoy talking to him. He likes to talk about his business," said C. 
Lee Cox, president and chief executive of PacTel Corp., the holding company for 
Pacific Telesis Group's cellular operations and other unregulated businesses. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw is said to have likened himself to the Wizard of Oz at a company retreat 
about a year ago. Not many in the industry would deny that he is a wizard of a 
sort. He defied assumptions just a few years ago that the so-called Baby Bell 
telephone companies, created after the 1986 breakup of American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph, would dominate new cellular business because of their financial and 
marketing strength. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw Cellular now has interests in cellular systems serving an estimated 57 
million "pops" -- an industry market share measure calculated by multiplying 
the number of people in a market area by the percent a firm owns of a company 
serving the area. (If a company owns 50% of a firm serving a market with 10 
million people, it has 5 million pops.) By that standard, McCaw Cellular is 
almost twice as big as Pacific Telesis, the industry's No. 2 company. 
</P>
<P>
To stay ahead of its rivals, McCaw has taken on a staggering amount of debt -- 
about $1.8 billion, according to Security and Exchange Commission filings -- in 
part to finance acquisitions. Most of McCaw's debt is in "junk bonds" arranged 
by investment bankers Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
The borrowing hasn't yet paid off; interest expenses contributed to the 
company's loss of $297 million last year on revenue of $310.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Involvement 
</P>
<P>
"He's a pretty aggressive guy," said Bradford L. Peery, an independent analyst 
in San Francisco. McCaw is "willing to bet the store" to dominate the industry, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
His style resembles that of his father, who also tended to keep his own 
counsel. Although the elder McCaw assembled a radio and television empire, many 
of the operations were sold to pay debts after he died in 1969. All that was 
left for the four McCaw sons was a 7,000-subscriber Centralia, Wash., cable TV 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Today, all of the sons are officers and directors of the firm that grew out of 
that cable operation. Together, they own about 46% of McCaw Cellular, although 
Craig McCaw controls a crucial block of shares. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest, 42-year-old Bruce R. McCaw, is a vice president. He's also chairman 
of Westar Insurance Group. John E. McCaw Jr., 38, is executive vice president 
for acquisitions. The youngest brother, 34-year-old Keith W. McCaw, is a vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Craig McCaw attended Seattle's Lakeside School, where officials declined to 
talk about him at McCaw's request, and later studied history at Stanford 
University. 
</P>
<P>
After taking over the cable television franchise, Craig McCaw bought other 
cable properties and a telephone paging service. In 1982, though, he began 
pursuing cellular licenses and soon acquired interests in partnerships serving 
a number of areas, including Seattle and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the firm sold its cable interests to Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the 
Washington Redskins and the Woodland Hills-based Daily News, and went public. 
</P>
<P>
With a presence in 127 markets today, McCaw now has its eye on Lin Broadcasting 
partnerships in New York, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, along with Los 
Angeles. If McCaw proceeds with its proposed tender offer and completes the 
acquisition, analysts say, McCaw cellular would truly become an industry 
juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
For now, McCaw Cellular is biding its time before launching a proposed 
$120-a-share tender offer, possibly waiting for the price of Lin's stock to 
come down. Lin's stock price shot up to $129.50 after McCaw Cellular disclosed 
its plans, apparently on speculation that another bidder would emerge. None 
has, however, and the stock closed Friday at $122.50.

680 Workers Volunteer to Leave Xerox: Xerox Corp. said 680 employees nationwide 
have joined a voluntary job cut program announced in March. Xerox spokesman 
John Rasor said the voluntary reductions won't guarantee against future layoffs 
but the company had predicted that only 250 to 350 would take advantage of the 
program. In January, Xerox announced a $275-million streamlining program that 
would cut 2,000 jobs. Company officials it had not been decided if the rest of 
the job cuts would come through layoffs or voluntary retirements and 
resignations. The company said the market for cheaper and medium-priced 
electronic typewriters has shrunk much faster than expected, leaving the 
industry with excess capacity.

UAW CHIEF DEFENDS HIS LEADERSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
OPENS CONVENTION IN ANAHEIM BY BLASTING DISSIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of mounting criticism from union dissidents, the president of the 
United Auto Workers strongly defended his policy of increased cooperation with 
auto industry management at the opening of the UAW's national convention Sunday 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address to the meeting's 2,000 delegates, UAW President Owen 
Bieber also blasted the dissidents -- the union's "New Directions" faction -- 
for their failure to understand the harsh realities of international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The union must adapt to the modern environment, Bieber argued, and must be 
willing to establish joint programs with management on the shop floor to 
staunch the flow of jobs overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"To be frank, I think those who say that workers don't want change in the 
workplace, who insist that the old ways were always the best ways, are 
insulting the intelligence of UAW members," Bieber said at the start of the 
six-day conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Replacing 'Raw Antagonism' 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be a basic conflict between the interest of workers and the 
interst of employers," he observed. "But there needs to be something better 
than only conflict and only raw antagonism," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bieber's speech at the Anaheim Convention Center went to the heart of the 
bitter debate now under way between the leadership of the nation's most 
influential industrial union and the upstart New Directions coalition. It is a 
philosophical debate that has brought about the most serious rift that the 
union has experienced in decades. 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents insist that cooperation with management has done little to 
provide workers with job security -- the stated goal of most joint 
labor-management programs -- and instead has subverted the rights of workers, 
reducing the union's power on the factory floor. 
</P>
<P>
The New Directions faction argues that only when the UAW asserts its power -- 
indeed, makes the companies fear it once more -- will the union be able to 
protect its members from layoffs and plant closings. 
</P>
<P>
As Bieber said Sunday, however, the UAW's leadership insists that it can't 
return to such an adversarial strategy. Unless the union works with management, 
the leaders argue, more and more jobs will simply slip overseas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stung by Dissident Charges 
</P>
<P>
"Are we smart enough and strong enough as trade unionists to understand that we 
don't have to embrace the employer, that we only have to care about our own 
members, in order to want to be involved in programs that make the workplace 
function better?" Bieber asked. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Bieber, stung by the dissident charges that he is aligned with 
management, stressed that the UAW is still willing to use its traditional 
tactic of "militant action" when necessary in bargaining with the auto 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not retreat from doing what's right for people, whether it's through 
some joint process or through militant action," Bieber said. "And we will not 
be deterred by those whose political convenience is served by questioning our 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bieber was not afraid to compare his policies with those of 
the union's legendary father figure, Walter Reuther -- especially now that 
Reuther's sole surviving brother has joined forces with the dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
"In an earlier era, there were also people who called Walter Reuther the boss' 
boy, but Walter and his colleagues in this union as a whole did more for 
workers than all of his critics and all of the ideologues put together," Bieber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bieber's supporters praised him for making such a strong stand against the 
dissident movement at the outset of the widely anticipated convention, a 
gathering the dissidents hope to use as a forum from which to launch a more 
organized opposition to the UAW leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a very strong defense, one that was obviously very well received by 
the convention," said former UAW President Douglas Fraser. "I think the 
leadership got off to a very strong start today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setback for Dissidents 
</P>
<P>
Still, leaders of the dissident group dismissed Bieber's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong as hell to gloss over the problems of this union with a glowing 
speech," complained Pete Kelly, president of UAW Local 160 in Warren, Mich., 
and a leader of the New Directions coalition. Immediately after Bieber's 
speech, the union's leadership dealt a sharp political setback to the 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
The convention's credentials committee, dominated by Bieber supporters, denied 
virtually all of the charges of election fraud brought by New Directions 
against the union's leadership in the cases of two dissidents who ran 
unsuccessfully for top union offices this spring. In both cases, the dissident 
group is likely to challenge the election results in court.

Growers Consider Giving Apples Away: As sales of Washington apples hit their 
lowest point of an Alar-plagued year, some growers are considering giving away 
fruit to the poor as a way to reduce supplies and raise prices. One proposal 
includes taking a truckload of Washington apples to New York City and giving 
them away to show how desperate the situation is, said Jim Clements, president 
of the Washington Assn. of Apple Growers.

Illinois Offers $33 Million to Sears: Illinois has offered $33 million to 
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. to keep its retail headquarters in the state it has 
called home for more than 100 years. Sears has said it will announce by the end 
of the month whether its 6,000-employee Merchandise Group will remain in 
Illinois. Speculation for a new site has focused on an area west of Chicago, 
Dallas, and Raleigh and Charlotte, N.C. The Merchandise Group, which has a $411 
million annual payroll and produces about $19.4 million a year in state and 
local taxes, is being moved from Sears Tower to cut costs; the company is also 
selling the skyscraper. Gov. James R. Thompson signed legislation earmarking 
$33 million to Sears' incentive package. The money could be used for land, site 
improvements or infrastructure at any Illinois site. Chicago already has 
offered unspecified incentives to Sears.

Atlantic Entertainment 'Regroups': In the wake of layoffs and missed paychecks 
at Atlantic Entertainment Group last week, Chief Executive Alan Saffron issued 
a statement saying the company "is regrouping and restructuring in order to be 
able to conduct the business of acquiring and distributing films more 
efficiently." In the past, Saffron has said he was unable to raise the capital 
that he promised to bring to the independent film company when he bought it 
last December. Two weeks ago, four of the company's top executives left, and a 
spokesman at the time cited Atlantic's severe financial troubles as the reason.

EXPERTS SAY KRAFT MISHANDLED CONTEST PR 
</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>

<P>
When Kraft realized its "Ready to Roll" contest was flawed and had produced 
more winners than losers, the food company should have decided on a response 
more quickly, public relations experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The contest, in which hundreds or possibly thousands of people "won" the same 
$17,000 Dodge minivan, was a public relations disaster that left Kraft 
officials scurrying for a response when the error was discovered June 11. 
</P>
<P>
"Our advice to Kraft immediately would have been to go public with this thing," 
said Walter Mulhall, co-director of Mulhall-Kemplin Communications. "The way to 
handle things is to offer a lot of explanation and candor, and they're 
certainly not being candid." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, based in Glenview, Ill., offered Thursday to make up for the mix-up by 
quadrupling the number of prizes, giving away cash and adding special drawings. 
But experts said the offer came too late. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that the public understands is that people screw up," said Pat 
Jackson, editor of PR Reporter, an industry magazine. "Kraft should have gone 
public. If they carried it off with humility, they could have gotten the public 
on their side." At least two lawsuits have been filed because of the botched 
contest.

THE ALMIGHTY ATM; 
</P>
<P>
CUSTOMERS FLOCK TO AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES BUT SOME BANKS SAY FUNCTIONS ARE 
UNDER-USED

Spencer Nilson went to Las Vegas a few weeks back and did not bother to take 
any cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Every casino has an automated teller machine," the Santa Monica businessman 
said. "I always know that as long as I've got these access cards, I never need 
to worry about cash." 
</P>
<P>
That could be a dangerous convenience in Las Vegas, but more Americans than 
ever are using automated teller machines, known as ATMs, and no one is more 
aware of it than Nilson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a leading newsletter 
for the credit card and ATM industries. 
</P>
<P>
"People want cash," said Nilson, who carries four ATM cards. "That's the single 
most-used function of any ATM card. People are using them instead of checks. It 
is more convenient." 
</P>
<P>
Convenience has been the chief selling point for ATMs since they were 
introduced in this country more than a decade ago, and the numbers indicate 
that people do find them useful. 
</P>
<P>
Transactions using ATMs have grown every year, reaching 4.6 billion in 1988, 
according to Nilson. There were 138 million access cards in the United States 
at the end of last year, and Nilson projects that the figure will rise to 145 
million in 1990 and 175 million in 1995. There were 67,000 ATMs nationwide in 
1988, a figure that Nilson sees reaching 73,000 in 1990 and 91,000 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9,700 ATMs in California 
</P>
<P>
California leads the nation both in number of ATMs -- more than 9,700 -- and 
number of cards -- more than 24 million. Residents here also are more active in 
using their cards. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Champ, vice president of San Diego-based Star System, said surveys by the 
regional ATM network show that 69% of state cardholders use their cards at 
least once a month, compared to a national average of about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"They really are becoming a method of everyday banking," said Champ, whose 
network provides links to 7,457 ATMs in five Western states and Hawaii for the 
392 banks, thrifts credit unions that belong to Star. 
</P>
<P>
National and regional networks, such as Star, which allow a customer of one 
bank to use ATMs at hundreds of locations, have contributed to the increasing 
convenience of ATMs. Small banks, particularly, like the networks because they 
expand their geographic reach so dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the steady growth, some in the banking industry feel that ATMs have not 
lived up to their promise. They complain that it is difficult to get more than 
half their customers to use the cards regularly, making the expensive machines 
and the computers that run them less cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
The United States lags far behind Japan both in number of machines and 
frequency of use. For instance, although Japan has a population half the size 
of the United States', there are 80,000 ATMs there, according to Nilson's 
latest worldwide survey. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Bond, an expert in boosting card use, said banks are coming up with 
some clever ways to increase use. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm seeing a tremendous surge in enthusiasm," said Bond, who is head of a 
consulting firm in Hartford, Conn., called C. Bond &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Drive-up ATMs are growing in popularity, including at some Security Pacific 
branches, although banks are finding engineering problems in serving vehicles 
of different heights, such as high-axle Blazers and ground-hugging Corvettes. 
Some new ATMs use color display screens, which are supposed to be easier to 
read. Pilot programs use ATMs to dispense postage stamps, travelers checks and 
airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispensing Ski Lift Tickets 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate Bank of Nevada, part of First Interstate Bancorp in Los 
Angeles, is testing ATMs to dispense ski lift tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be working well and be accepted by consumers," said Andrew P. 
Studdert, head of consumer banking for the parent company. "And the lift lines 
move faster." 
</P>
<P>
At seminars she conducts for banks, Bond stresses that the most important step 
in increasing ATM use is talking to customers about their needs and the way 
ATMs fulfill them. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people still look on ATMs as emergency cash machines, and the industry 
has been talking just about convenience," said Bond. "But ATMs also offer 
privacy, no request for an identification, and control over account transfers." 
</P>
<P>
Star System's Champ said an important element in persuading people to overcome 
their fears of ATM technology is providing plenty of live demonstrations that 
consumers can understand. That means using bilingual demonstrators and some 
other twists. One savings and loan had a 72-year-old woman demonstrate to 
senior citizens in Sun City, Calif., how ATMs work. 
</P>
<P>
The next big step in ATM convenience will probably be a link between the 
nation's two largest ATM networks, Plus System in Denver and Cirrus in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The link will mean that a customer of a bank that belongs to either system 
would be able to get cash from any one of the combined 52,000 machines -- from 
Las Vegas to, say, Atlantic City.

MOST ATM FRAUD THE WORK OF THIEVES -- NOT HIGH-TECH WIZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proliferation of automated teller machines has led to a rise in ATM fraud. 
But rather than spawning a new breed of high-tech computer criminals, most 
cases involve the theft of access cards. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there have been some big losses. But they usually turn out to be 
inside jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles last year, Security Pacific National Bank lost $350,000 in an 
unsolved ATM fraud that federal authorities suspect involved a bank employee. 
In another case, a ring of would-be ATM bandits was broken up before executing 
a scheme that authorities said could have netted $14 million from accounts at 
Bank of America. The leader was a computer programmer working on ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
But more than 95% of ATM fraud cases come from unauthorized use of cards or 
other direct consumer fraud, according to a survey last year by the Bank 
Administration Institute, an industry research group. 
</P>
<P>
And while losses in individual cases of lost or stolen cards are usually small, 
they have led to enough complaints from consumers that federal regulators have 
set up guidelines limiting customer liability. 
</P>
<P>
"From the banks' perspective, the regulations are very protective of the 
consumer," said Marcia Z. Sullivan, a lawyer for the Consumer Bankers Assn. in 
Washington. "Even if the consumer is negligent and leaves his or her PIN 
(personal identification number) on the card, there is no way that the 
consumer's negligence contributes to whether or not they get their money back." 
</P>
<P>
The consumer's liability is determined by the promptness in reporting the loss 
of the card or the unauthorized transfers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lie Detectors Used 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, a consumer can limit his or her liability to $50 by notifying 
the bank of the loss or theft within two business days. A customer who waits 
more than two days may be liable for up to $500. Waiting more than 60 days 
leaves a customer responsible for any amount withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Liability for unauthorized withdrawals can lead to disputes between customers 
and banks. Often banks find that family members have made the unauthorized 
withdrawals. Some banks use lie detectors to verify customer stories. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who are not satisfied with an institution's response may complain to 
the consumer division of the agency overseeing the institution. For banks, that 
is either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Federal Reserve Board or the 
Office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. For savings and loan firms, it 
is the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and ATM networks advise several steps for minimizing the chances of a 
loss: 
</P>
<P>
Memorize your PIN. Do not write it down, particularly not on the back of your 
card or elsewhere in your wallet or purse. 
</P>
<P>
Protect your ATM access card as carefully as cash and credit cards. If it is 
lost or stolen, notify your bank or thrift immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid allowing anyone watch you enter the PIN in the machine. Use your body or 
hand to shield the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
Be aware of your surroundings when you use an ATM. Avoid using machines in 
unlighted locations or isolated spots at night.

MEMO: AUTOMATED TELLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent California court case may have a dramatic impact on access to ATMs by 
people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a California appeals court reversed a lower court ruling and 
said banks have a statutory duty under state civil rights laws to provide 
access to ATMs for such people. The case had been brought against a Sacramento 
bank by a man in a wheelchair who said stairs to an ATM blocked his access. 
</P>
<P>
The California Bankers Assn. has been working with state officials for some 
time in an attempt to come up with standards for access to the machines. But 
the bankers feel that the issue was clouded by the appeals court ruling because 
it left unclear the degree of access that must be provided, such as whether 
special access must be provided to one machine at a financial institution or to 
all of them, said Maurine C. Padden, legislative counsel for the bankers group. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, banks expect to spend a considerable amount of money 
redesigning installations to make the machines more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, Bank of America's ATMs have dispensed more than $36 billion in cash 
-- enough $20 bills to reach around the Equator seven times. 
</P>
<P>
B of A has more ATMs than any other bank in the country; it opened its 1,500th 
in April in Del Mar. Since 1979, Bank of America customers have conducted more 
than 975 million ATM transactions, and the bank now processes almost seven such 
transactions a second. 
</P>
<P>
Diebold Inc. of Canton, Ohio, dominates the market for ATM manufacturers in the 
United States with a 46% share, according to Spencer Nilson, publisher of the 
Santa Monica-based Nilson Report. Next are NCR at 20% and IBM at 19%. 
</P>
<P>
Two domestic makers discontinued production last year, and two Japanese firms 
are trying to break into the market. Japan's Fujitsu has a 2% share of the U.S. 
market and Omron, another Japanese firm, has 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Nilson says he does not expect the market shares to change much in the United 
States in the coming years. Worldwide, NCR is the leader, followed by Diebold 
and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
An ATM can cost between $10,000 and $40,000, depending on the sophistication of 
the machine and the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Diebold's $10,000 model simply dispenses cash. For $35,000 or so, a buyer gets 
an ATM capable of multiple functions, such as accepting deposits, issuing a 
written balance statement, transferring money between accounts and paying 
bills. The more expensive machines are the biggest sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are increasingly trying to recover their costs and generate income by 
charging fees for ATM transactions. Nilson says the average is now about 50 
cents, but he expects most transactions to cost $1 before too long. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers may have made their ATMs too well. 
</P>
<P>
Shipments of new machines have remained flat in recent years. Manufacturers had 
expected replacements to take up the slack and make up 50% of the market by 
now. But that has not happened. 
</P>
<P>
Users have found that the machines do not seem to wear out as fast as had been 
expected. The average life of a machine has gone to 10 years from 7 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, replacements accounted for about 35% of ATM installations, according 
to an article this month in Bank Administration, an industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and ATM networks are paranoid about security. 
</P>
<P>
They do not want to talk about how much cash their machines hold, and no 
institution will allow a photograph to be taken off the back side of an ATM for 
fear it would expose the inner workings to would-be criminals. 
</P>
<P>
A writer for an underground publication got a picture of the inside of a 
machine a few years ago, however, and used it to illustrate an article on how 
to break into an ATM. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, industry sources say ATMs in busy locations are loaded with as much 
as $250,000 in cash for a weekend.

The driver of a pickup truck that flipped over on Interstate 5 near San Juan 
Capistrano Sunday -- injuring seven people, including 3 children -- has been 
charged with turning too sharply onto the shoulder of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Lauro Montoya, 27, of Los Angeles, was charged in the accident, which occurred 
shortly after a tire on the truck blew out, according to Officer Carl Twigg of 
the California Highway Patrol. Montoya apparently panicked and swerved onto the 
left hand shoulder, Twigg said, causing the truck to overturn and crack open 
the camper shell in which five women and three children were riding. (Story, 
Part II, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
One of those passengers, 29-year-old Manuela Perea, was in critical condition 
today at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Elizabeth 
Perea, 3, was in satisfactory condition at Mission Hospital with a fractured 
pelvis and right leg. Melissa Bailon, 10 months old, suffered a skull fracture 
but was in satisfactory condition at the Mission Viejo hospital. 
</P>
<P>
One passenger, Janet Perea, 1 year old, was in stable condition at San Clemente 
Hospital. The other injured were treated at San Clemente Hospital and released, 
a spokeswoman said.

Margaret Randall, a writer threatened with deportation from the United States 
for supporting communism, lost a Supreme Court appeal today. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that it is premature to 
consider the constitutional and legal issues she raised. 
</P>
<P>
Her appeal was supported by a number of prominent writers, including Norman 
Mailer, Arthur Miller, Toni Morrison, William Styron and Kurt Vonnegut. 
</P>
<P>
Randall lost her U.S. citizenship after leaving this country in 1961. She lived 
in Mexico, Cuba and Nicaragua, writing about social change and revolution in 
Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to this country on a visitor's visa in 1984 and has been living in 
Albuquerque, N.M., near her elderly parents, and teaching at the University of 
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Randall applied for permanent resident status in 1984, a step toward regaining 
her U.S. citizenship. The application was rejected by an official of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service.

The burned body of a man was found in the office of a Panorama City used car 
dealership that was struck by fire this morning, the Los Angeles City Fire 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 3:30 a.m. at K-9 Motors in the 8800 block of Woodman 
Avenue, said Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo. The fire caused an 
estimated $120,000 damage to the two-story office and garage and to a few cars 
parked near the structure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the victim, whose name was not released, was an employee of 
the dealership and apparently fell asleep on a bed in the office while smoking.

Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. will retire when his second two-year term as chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expires at the end of September, defense officials 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The officials confirmed a report by the industry publication Air Force Times 
that Crowe, 64, was asked by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to extend his tour 
by at least a year but declined. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't formally announced that he's going to retire," a spokesman for the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff said. But other defense officials who requested anonymity 
said Crowe -- now on a tour of the Soviet Union -- has decided to retire at the 
end of this term. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Times said some Pentagon staff members are speculating that Cheney 
will urge President Bush to name Army Gen. Colin L. Powell to succeed Crowe. 
Powell served as national security adviser to former President Ronald Reagan.

No one immediately claimed responsibility, but West German authorities said 
they suspected the Irish Republican Army was responsible.

The two attackers fled after they were surprised by a West German employee at

The employee was hit in the face and investigators later found four more

President Bush, opening a week of White House events focusing on youth, today 
called for a day when every school in the nation will be "safe and drug free." 
</P>
<P>
At a Rose Garden ceremony, Bush honored schools for their efforts to rid their 
corridors and classrooms of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven schools from 24 states and the District of Columbia were honored in 
the annual Drug-Free Schools recognition program, launched by drug policy 
coordinator William J. Bennett when he was secretary of education in the Ronald 
Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"As I look around here today, I see some of the top commandos in the war on 
drugs -- our teachers, community leaders, parents and students," the President 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're the ones winning this war, because you are the ones looking to 
tomorrow, you're the ones who know it takes a clear mind to get a good 
education and lead a productive life. You understand that students have a right 
to learn in drug-free schools."

GOP SENATORS URGE BUSH NOT TO ELEVATE FISKE

<P>
Fourteen Republican senators, including Sen. Strom Thurmond, the ranking GOP 
member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, questioned the party loyalty of New 
York attorney Robert B. Fiske Jr. and urged President Bush today not to 
nominate him as deputy attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not appear that Mr. Fiske shares the basic approach to matters of 
legal and judicial policy which you so effectively articulated in your winning 
campaign for President," the senators said in a letter to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"We therefore respectfully urge you to reconsider this matter and select a 
nominee with a demonstrated commitment to your principles, and those of the 
Republican platform, in these important areas," the senators said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Bush heeds the advice or not, it is clear that Fiske would face tough 
questioning from some Republican senators during Senate confirmation hearings 
before the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, well after the Republicans began circulating the letter to collect 
signatures, Bush appeared to endorse Fiske, who has been recommended by Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
At a gathering of federal prosecutors at the White House, Bush noted that his 
Administration included several former U.S. attorneys in key positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see yet another -- Bob Fiske of New York -- joining our ranks here 
soon," Bush said without elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Serious Concerns' 
</P>
<P>
The 14 mostly conservative senators said they have "serious concerns" about 
Fiske based on his tenure as chairman of the American Bar Assn.'s Standing 
Committee on Federal Judiciary, according to the June 14 letter that was 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
The senators contend that during Fiske's chairmanship, the panel "improperly 
applied ideological criteria to thwart the nominations of various 
well-qualified candidates" that then-President Ronald Reagan had nominated to 
the federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
The senators said Fiske, a pillar of the New York legal establishment who once 
was U.S. attorney in Manhattan, gave liberal organizations the names of people 
under consideration for judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
"Such leaks permitted groups opposed to the President's judicial philosophy to 
attack the candidates and prevent their nomination," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Fiske and the ABA have acknowledged that two liberal organizations were given 
the names of prospective nominees for the purpose of determining if the 
candidates had ever shown bias against women or minorities.

Premier Li Peng said today that none of the nations criticizing China's 
suppression of dissidents would have shown as much restraint, and he honored as 
martyrs three soldiers killed in the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"For more than 50 days our government, army and party were restrained," Li told 
the families of the dead soldiers at Communist Party headquarters, apparently 
referring to the weeks preceding the June 3-4 crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Some countries have attacked us, abused us and created rumors," he said. "Can 
their governments be so tolerant? You won't find one that is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,000 Arrested 
</P>
<P>
Since troops attacked central Beijing to crush seven weeks of protests, more 
than 1,000 people have been arrested and at least 11 have been sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Western intelligence sources and Chinese witnesses say up to 3,000 people were 
killed in the crackdown. The government says fewer than 300 died, half of them 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Since declaring martial law May 20 in Beijing, Li has emerged as the chief 
spokesman for the government's hard-line position against the student-led 
movement for greater freedoms and an end to government corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a special session of the national legislature headed by a more 
moderate official was postponed today. 
</P>
<P>
Wan Li, the chairman of the National People's Congress, had scheduled a 
congress session beginning Tuesday "to discuss issues of people's common 
concern and prompt the government to improve its work." 
</P>
<P>
Wan, who has a reputation as a moderate, called the session before the June 3-4 
crackdown. Some students had hoped it would approve some of the democratic 
reforms they were demanding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No New Date Set 
</P>
<P>
But the congress press office said the session was postponed because Beijing 
had not yet returned completely to normal. No new date was set. 
</P>
<P>
The legislature may be waiting until the Communist Party holds an anticipated 
Central Committee meeting to formally oust party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. 
Zhao reportedly has been stripped of his power for opposing the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
He and party propaganda chief Hu Qili are the only top officials believed 
purged. Wan has supported the crackdown publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The government announced it was expelling the sixth foreign reporter in the 
last 10 days. The official New China News Agency said Joseph Kahn, a part-time 
reporter for the Dallas Morning News, was given 72 hours to leave.

The sponsors of two interstate pipeline companies and Southern California Gas 
Co., the nation's largest gas utility, today said they have settled a four-year 
regulatory dispute, apparently clearing the way for two natural gas pipelines 
into Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Kern River Gas Transmission Co., Mojave Pipeline Co., and 
Southern California Gas Co. must still be approved by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, both Kern River and Mojave would build and operate 
pipelines into California to a point in the desert near Barstow, where the 
pipelines would merge. 
</P>
<P>
From there, both systems would continue in a single, jointly owned pipeline to 
the oil fields of Kern County. There the gas would be burned to produce steam, 
to be used in bringing tar-like oil to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the settlement, SoCal Gas, Kern River and Mojave would continue 
to compete for customers. The companies must first, however, persuade federal 
regulators that sufficient competition remains. 
</P>
<P>
The new pipelines had been opposed by California regulators, SoCal Gas and 
consumer groups on the basis that they would bypass existing utilities, leaving 
customers unserved by the pipeline with a heavier burden.

20% RAISES ANNOUNCED FOR 2,000 CONTROLLERS AT 11 BUSIEST AIRPORTS

Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner today said about 2,100 air traffic 
controllers, technicians and safety inspectors at some of the nation's busiest 
airports will get raises of up to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The raises for Federal Aviation Administration employees at 11 sites in the New 
York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland areas are part of a five-year program to 
retain and recruit workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has said it is difficult to staff those sites because of the high cost 
of living and the tough workload. The raises will mean "some of the highest 
paid people in the federal government" will be working for the FAA, Skinner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference near the nation's busiest airport, O'Hare International, 
Skinner said a controller on the top rung of the seniority ladder makes at 
least $60,000 a year, including overtime. The raises will be added to base pay. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Department officials said the cost of the program will be about 
$5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being short of help, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland 
have many workers who are near retirement. But since the raises were proposed a 
few months ago, controllers in other areas of the country have applied for 
transfer and some who were ready to retire want to stay, Skinner said.

SUPREME COURT OKS DRUG TESTS OF RAIL WORKERS

The Supreme Court today gave railroads broader power to test their workers for 
drugs, upholding routine tests for Conrail employees. 
</P>
<P>
By a 7-2 vote, the justices said Conrail -- the Consolidated Rail Corp. -- can 
require the tests without permitting collective bargaining over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The decision marks the first time that the court has ruled on drug testing by 
private employers. But the ruling is based on an interpretation of the federal 
Railway Labor Act and may not have sweeping impact for other workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sensitive Government Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Last March, in its first rulings on testing for drug and alcohol abuse in the 
American workplace, the court said workers in sensitive government jobs or 
entrusted with public safety can be forced to undergo the tests. 
</P>
<P>
In the Conrail case, the railroad announced in February, 1987, that it 
unilaterally would check for drugs as part of a urinalysis administered 
periodically to workers and also when they returned to work after an absence. 
</P>
<P>
The railway said the need for the tests was magnified by an accident at Chase, 
Md., on Jan. 4, 1987, in which an Amtrak passenger train collided with Conrail 
locomotives, killing 16 people and injuring 174 others. The Conrail engineer 
and brakeman subsequently were found to have been using marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urine Tests Since 1976 
</P>
<P>
Conrail has conducted urine tests since 1976 as part of periodic physical 
examinations administered to workers at intervals varying between one and three 
years depending on the employee's age and job classification. 
</P>
<P>
But those tests were aimed at discovering whether a worker, for example, had 
diabetes and not whether the employee was using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Railway labor unions said adding the drug-screening component to the urinalysis 
is a "major" labor-management dispute as defined by the federal Railway Labor 
Act and therefore must be submitted to collective bargaining.

SOONERS' SWITZER QUITS UNDER FIRE;

<P>
Oklahoma's Barry Switzer, the fourth most successful coach in the history of 
college football, resigned today just months after his program was tainted by 
NCAA probation and criminal charges against some players. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said at a news conference today that he was stepping down effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the Oklahoma football program told the Associated Press 
earlier that Switzer met with the football staff this morning and told them of 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Drained' by Experiences 
</P>
<P>
The source said that Switzer was "drained by things he's gone through in the 
last few months," a reference to the NCAA probation imposed on the school's 
football program in December and three separate criminal incidents that led to 
charges against Oklahoma players earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The source said that Switzer was concerned that he no longer had the "energy 
and enthusiasm" to give to the program. 
</P>
<P>
The source said a leading candidate to replace Switzer was defensive 
coordinator Gary Gibbs and that a replacement could be named as early as 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer has had the top winning percentage among major-college football coaches 
since 1982. His teams won three national championships and 12 Big Eight 
Conference championships in his 16 seasons as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer had been under fire for more than six months, since before the Sooners 
were placed on a three-year NCAA probation in December. Switzer was named in 
four of the 20 violations, but denied knowledge of breaking any NCAA rules. He 
was not penalized by the university. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer already had faced controversy when former Sooner linebacker Brian 
Bosworth wrote a book, which came out last August, saying players used cocaine 
and fired guns at the dormitory. Bosworth, who left the team after the 1986 
season, also referred to NCAA violations and said the Oklahoma football program 
bordered on anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Switzer called Bosworth's claims sensationalism. 
</P>
<P>
The state's largest newspapers called for Switzer's resignation after five of 
his players were charged with felonies earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
One player was charged with wounding another player in a dormitory shooting 
incident. Three players were charged with first-degree rape in an alleged 
dormitory assault on an Oklahoma City woman. And quarterback Charles Thompson 
was charged in federal court with cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer has an .844 winning percentage, with 157 victories, 26 losses and four 
ties.

The St. Louis Cardinals today reinstated right-handed pitcher Ted Power to

</P>
<P>
The Cardinals also announced that team doctor Stan London put McGee's wrist in 
a cast Tuesday. London said the cast would help immobilize the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
McGee last appeared in a game June 6. His placement on the disabled list is 
retroactive to June 7.

Power, 34, comes off the 21-day disabled list. He suffered a pulled left

High water levels of the Ohio River caused organizers today to postpone the 
Thunder on the Ohio unlimited hydroplane race scheduled this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since 1981 that the race has been postponed. Under the 
revised schedule, qualifying will be conducted July 7 and 8, and racing will 
begin at noon on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Theubach, director of the Freedom Festival, said the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers has projected that the river will crest at 35.7 feet on Thursday, the 
day before qualifying was to have begun. "If the river is higher than 22 feet, 
we can't hold the race," Theubach said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not that the river is too deep, she explained. "It's the pits, 
that's all," she said. "The crews have to be able to set the cranes out, and if 
the concrete's under water, you can't set the cranes out."

The Atlanta Braves have reached an agreement with first-round draft choice 
Tyler Houston of Las Vegas that reportedly will make him the highest-paid 
draftee in the National League club's history. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not revealed, but The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported today 
that Houston will get more than the $230,000 bonus received by pitcher Andy 
Benes of the San Diego organization last year. The Atlanta record is a $211,000 
bonus to left-handed pitcher Steve Avery, the third pick in last year's draft. 
The younger Houston batted .485 with 13 home runs and 66 RBI in his senior year 
at Valley High School in Las Vegas. He is primarily a catcher, but has played 
at third base and shortstop.

The owners of the Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Bulls plan to blitz the 
Illinois General Assembly this week for help in building a hockey-basketball 
palace on Chicago's West Side. 
</P>
<P>
William Wirtz and Jerry Reinsdorf wanted to make their case three weeks ago, 
but were held up by Mayor Richard M. Daley, who wanted assurances that 70 
families to be displaced by the new arena would be adequately compensated, The 
Chicago Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The $110-million arena would seat 22,000 people and accommodate 7,000 cars on a 
lot directly south of the current Chicago Stadium. Wirtz and Reinsdorf are 
seeking a state subsidy to build the arena, the Tribune said. Unlike the new 
White Sox stadium on Chicago's South Side, the Hawks-Bulls arena would be 
privately financed.

Computer Associates International Inc. said today it will buy Cullinet Software 
Inc. for about $320 million in stock, a move that will strengthen its standing 
as the world's biggest independent software company. 
</P>
<P>
Computer Associates had $1.03 billion in revenue last year, becoming the first 
software company to reach the billion-dollar mark. Cullinet had revenue of $203 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies get most of their revenue from software that runs on big 
mainframe computers made by International Business Machines Corp., although 
Computer Associates' appetite for acquisitions has carried it into other 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
Computer Associates is headed by Charles B. Wang, who has vowed to increase 
revenue by 30% a year. Its growth strategy has vaulted it ahead of such 
better-known companies as Microsoft Corp. and Lotus Development Corp.
