WOMEN DRIVERS;

<P>
SAFE SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old jokes about women drivers have long been stale, but they've kept coming 
nonstop anyway. Now maybe a new survey will at least slow them down. 
</P>
<P>
Comics years ago would paint vivid pictures of a white-knuckled husband trying 
to teach a wide-eyed wife how to parallel park. In recent years, the jokes have 
become a bit more sophisticated: the smirking remark has been that women should 
be required during driving tests to simulate real driving conditions -- such as 
applying mascara and lipstick in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
A great woman political leader once said that while women are certainly no 
worse than men, "whether women are better than men I cannot say." Well, women 
now can say they are better when it comes to mastering driving in California. 
</P>
<P>
A Times analysis of nearly 179,000 California driver records during most of the 
1980s showed that women generally were much safer drivers than men their age. 
Sixteen-year-old girls had a violation rate one-quarter that of boys the same 
age. Although the worst drivers of both sexes tended to be 18-year-olds, it 
took women until only age 23 to arrive at the statewide accident average -- 
while men didn't reach that average level until they were in the age 35-39 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that after all this time, we've discovered what it is a woman 
wants? She wants to avoid moving violations and accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry it's come to down to this, Dr. Freud. But you never had to drive in 
California.

GOODMAN ON THE SEMANTICS OF THE ABORTION CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I strongly agree with the Bush Administration. Hopefully, clinic officials will 
not be able to give their own advice or opinions and women will not be 
encouraged or discouraged to have or not have an abortion. Many women would 
probably take the advice of a professional because they supposedly know what is 
best, or right.

POVERTY FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
If "Broad Attack on Poverty Proposed," (Part A, June 6), had been about a 
report on alleviating poverty in a foreign country, especially a European 
country, the U.S. government would have advanced financial proposals for 
achieving the ambitious goals proposed by the private-sector leaders. However, 
and lamentably, since this report outlines domestic poverty, the outlook and 
probability for U.S. government funding is dim. 
</P>
<P>
As an American of Mexican descent, I must look with some envy at our government 
appropriations that allocate massive quantities of our taxpayer money to 
foreign aid, while the Bush Administration pays more mere "lip service" to 
pressing and long-neglected domestic needs. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, while the report -- "Three Realities: Minority Life in the United 
States" -- notes that the broad attack on poverty "will require concerted 
efforts by the full range of institutions," it is the federal government that 
must be in the forefront of the attack. Obviously, the U.S business community 
is demonstrating uncanny insight into an impending crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Unless President Bush shows leadership on the domestic poverty issue and its 
root causes -- including misguided (that's putting it mildly) Reagan-Bush 
Administration policies -- I am afraid nothing will change except America's 
ability to compete in the coming world economy.

BEDLAM IN BUCHAREST: BUT WHY?; 
</P>
<P>
ILIESCU GOVERNMENT HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is still much confusion about the origin and sequence of events that last 
week brought to Bucharest the worst violence Romania has seen since the 
December revolution. There is no uncertainty, however, about the persistent 
brutish side of Romanian politics that this deadly confrontation revealed. 
</P>
<P>
President-elect Ion Iliescu's new regime has been shown to be as nearly 
intolerant of dissent as its dictatorial predecessors. Romania's efforts to 
replace authoritarian Communist rule with more open and representative 
government have never seemed more fragile. A party that says it is composed of 
former Communists, and that just last month swept to power with more than 80% 
of the popular vote, could think of no more creative way to deal with 
opposition protests than by a panicky recourse to primitive vigilantism. Most 
of Eastern Europe is democratizing. Romania appears simply to be reverting to 
form. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be explained why the police and army failed to handle the angry 
response when the interim government moved at mid-week to quash what until then 
had been a peaceful anti-Communist protest. Were these forces inactive out of 
sympathy for the protesters, or were they trying to sabotage Iliescu for less 
noble motives? In any event, Iliescu turned to rent-a-mob, calling in miners 
whose loyalty he had secured with a huge pay raise. Besides random assaults on 
the populace, the mob staged well-planned attacks on opposition party leaders, 
headquarters and publications. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Community, whose goodwill and support 
Romania desperately needs, have responded appropriately. Washington says it 
will withhold all but humanitarian aid to show its displeasure, while the EC 
has postponed a trade and cooperation agreement with Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu says his regime is committed to democratic principles. He has yet to 
show he understands the meaning of those words.

A RIGHTS EROSION IN MEXICO?; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT SALINAS HIMSELF NEEDS TO MONITOR THIS SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico is a nation not normally associated with official brutality found in 
places like El Salvador. This is why the recent report on rights violations in 
Mexico by the respected human-rights organization Americas Watch is all the 
more noteworthy. The report merits the personal attention of President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
Americas Watch concludes that, in their zeal to combat drugs and limit 
political dissent, some Mexican police officials have "institutionalized" the 
practice of torturing prisoners. The report also noted that between 1970 and 
1988, 51 Mexican journalists were killed pursuing news stories involving 
official corruption or drug-trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
In a climate like that, the recent threats against Jorge Castaneda, a professor 
at Mexico's national university and a regular contributor to The Times, must be 
regarded seriously. Castaneda's articles have usually been critical of the 
Salinas government. His view on Mexican politics, while not often shared by 
this editorial page, nonetheless deserve a wide audience. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that some Mexicans would rather those views weren't widely heard, 
which may have been why four armed men stopped Castaneda's secretary on a 
Mexico City street last week, questioned her about him and his family and told 
her "this is just the first call. If he keeps it up, he'll really get 
(obscenity)." 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that Salinas defended Castaneda when the incident was made 
public, saying such a blatant effort to stifle dissent is "unacceptable." In 
its report, Americas Watch credited Salinas with trying to improve the climate 
in Mexico by resurrecting a human-rights office in the federal government and 
naming a national commission to oversee its work. But the report warns that 
Salinas must not opt for "form over substance in the promotion and protection 
of human rights." 
</P>
<P>
One way for Salinas to prove he won't is to find, and discipline, the thugs who 
threatened Castaneda.

PROTECT EVEN THE UGLY PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
 WHY AN AMENDMENT IS A DEFEATIST MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week, the House of Representatives will take up the question of whether 
the Constitution of the United States ought to be amended so that Congress and 
the states may prohibit vandalism of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
Any debate of fundamental constitutional protections imposes special 
obligations: partisanship must give way to principle; passion, however deeply 
felt, must be subordinated to that right reason which gave the Framers the 
courage to put their faith in human liberty. If those conditions are met this 
week on the floor of the House -- and it would be an unforgivable breach of 
duty if they were not -- then this attempt to alter the First Amendment of the 
Bill of Rights will be turned back as it has been before. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has arisen because, over the past two years, a handful of 
inconsequential extremists, still clinging to the tattered fringes of the 
lunatic left, have discovered that while no one has the slightest interest in 
their ideas, they sometimes can attract the authorities' attention by burning 
flags. Twice in the past year the U.S. Supreme Court has been forced to declare 
unconstitutional the laws under which flag-burners have been prosecuted. As 
Justice William Brennan wrote for the court in the most recent of those 
decisions, "while flag desecration . . . is deeply offensive to many, the 
government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society 
finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable." 
</P>
<P>
That is as succinct and clear a statement of the First Amendment's guarantee of 
free speech as anyone ever has framed. The charter of which it is a part is the 
most majestic and flexible blueprint for the practical realization of basic 
human rights and liberties ever devised. Today, 201 years after James Madison 
first introduced it on the floor of Congress, it continues to stir the hearts 
of men and women from Prague to Santiago, from Warsaw to Beijing. It has 
survived without alteration both civil and foreign wars, Depression and social 
change unimagined by those great men who wrote it and, most recently, half a 
century of external confrontation with both right- and left-wing 
totalitarianism. It cannot be said by any reasonable person that the threat to 
the national well-being posed by flag-burners -- if it exists at all -- equals 
in the faintest way any of these challenges. 
</P>
<P>
But let us suppose, for a moment, that the opposite is true. Let us assume that 
the flag-burners among us are more than just a trifling handful of clownish 
exhibitionists with an unpleasant penchant for vulgar public tantrums. Let us 
suppose, instead, that they are what they imagine themselves to be: 
revolutionaries intent on the destruction of this republic. What a bitter irony 
it would be, if the Congress of the United States were to hand such people a 
victory they never could have won for themselves -- the subversion of our Bill 
of Rights.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE SWITCHED INTO FAST FORWARD JUST AS HE SEEMED SET TO FALL 
BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Allis, ABC's English color commentator during the U.S. Open, was talking 
about Mike Donald early in Sunday's fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
"Will he pull a Kuts?" Allis asked. 
</P>
<P>
Say what? 
</P>
<P>
Allis compared Donald's lead position to the front-running tactics of Vladimir 
Kuts, the great Soviet distance runner of the mid-1950s. Allis launched into a 
reminiscence about a race at London's White City Stadium in the mid-1950s, in 
which the then-unheralded Kuts bolted to an early lead and won, despite the 
track announcer's repeated assurances that the real race was between Englishmen 
Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher, both Englishmen. 
</P>
<P>
It's a good thing that Allis didn't continue his Kuts analogy through Sunday's 
final holes. There's no telling what he might have done with Kuts' best-known 
race, the 10,000 meters at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, when Kuts played a 
mind game with still another Englishman, Gordon Pirie. In "The Complete Book of 
the Olympics", David Wallechinsky describes that competition: 
</P>
<P>
"Several times (Kuts) sprinted out at a seemingly insane pace, only to have 
Pirie catch up each time. Alternatively, Kuts would slow down, move to the 
outside, and wave Pirie past him. But Pirie refused to bite, preferring to 
remain at Kuts' shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, at the end of the 20th lap, Kuts stopped so abruptly that Pirie was 
forced to take the lead. Relieved of the pressure of having Pirie on his heels, 
Kuts rested for a half lap while he studied his adversary in front of him. 
Then, just as abruptly as he had slowed, Kuts burst past Pirie to take the lead 
for good." 
</P>
<P>
Add Kuts: He set the Olympic record for the 10,000 that day, winning in 
28:45.6. Pirie wilted from the struggle, finishing eighth. Five days later, 
Kuts went back to his front-running style, winning the 5,000 meters in another 
Olympic record, 13:39.6. Pirie was second, 11 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
Last add Kuts: In 1975, he died at age 48 after suffering the fourth in a 
series of heart attacks that began in 1960. Writes Wallechinsky: "Unfortunately 
for Kuts, the experimental training program which the Soviet coaches had 
imposed on him took its toll." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the only NCAA Division I school to win more than one men's 
national championship during the 1989-90 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
Learning from history? Roger Craig, the San Francisco Giant manager, recently 
told Nick Peters of the Sacramento Bee that he was a longtime believer in using 
role players such as outfielders Rick Leach, Rick Parker and Mike Kingery. Said 
Craig: "I remember when I was with Brooklyn in 1955, and we called up a kid 
pitcher named Don Bessent. We probably wouldn't have won the pennant without 
him, and we had a lot of great players on that club." 
</P>
<P>
Craig may be correct in spirit, but the Dodgers won the 1955 National League 
pennant by 13 1/2 games. Bessent went 8-1 and had three saves. 
</P>
<P>
Add Bessent: The 1955 season was his heyday. His four-year major league career, 
mainly as a reliever, ended in 1958. His overall record: 14-7, 12 saves and an 
earned-run average of 3.33. In Game 2 of the 1956 World Series against the New 
York Yankees, he pitched seven innings in relief of Don Newcombe and Ed Roebuck 
and got credit for the Dodgers' 13-8 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bonus trivia question: What was Don Bessent's nickname? 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers' duel: In a recent California League game, the Visalia Oaks defeated 
the Bakersfield Dodgers, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
So? 
</P>
<P>
What made the game special was that a total of 28 batters reached base. Visalia 
had 11 hits (all singles), three walks and two hit batsmen, and left 12 men on 
base. Bakersfield had 10 hits (all singles), one walk and one hit batsman, and 
left 11. There were two double plays, and no one was caught stealing. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The University of Wisconsin, in ice hockey and rowing. 
</P>
<P>
Bonus trivia answer: The Weasel.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

Give me one-on-one golf any time. Neither Hale Irwin nor Mike Donald was up to 
par Monday, but their U.S. Open playoff was tense, tactical and competitive. 
Maybe the PGA Championship, which needs a boost, should return to its old 
match-play format. . . . 
</P>
<P>
As early as the 18th hole, you got the feeling that this was going to be 
Irwin's day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I was rooting for Irwin because, unlike many golfers, he doesn't wear a visor 
with advertising on it. . . . 
</P>

Relief Isn't Spelled W-e-l-l-s: When the Dodgers traded Franklin Stubbs to 
Houston, they got Terry Wells in return. He had been a reliever in the Astros' 
chain the last couple of seasons. As a starter at Albuquerque, he is 5-3 with a 
5.03 earned-run average. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The National League suddenly has become the hitters' league. Last season, 26 
American Leaguers and only 13 National Leaguers batted .300 or more. Sunday's 
averages showed 24 National Leaguers and only 21 American Leaguers batting at 
least .300. And, remember, there are two more teams in the AL. . . .

The Dodgers and Angels are both closer to last place than they are to first. .

Carlos Elliot is a likely opponent for Sugar Ray Leonard in Tokyo in November. 
Carlos who? Elliot, 28, is ranked first in the junior middleweight division by 
the World Boxing Assn. and, at last count, was 24-2 with 21 knockouts. He was 
born in Huntsville, Ala., but has done virtually all his professional fighting 
in Japan. It would be a 10-round non-title bout. . . . Dick Maestro of the 
Official Boxing Record informs me that the heaviest George Foreman has been for 
a fight is 267 pounds for the first bout of his comeback March 9, 1987, against 
Steve Zouski in Sacramento. Gorgeous George got down as low as 235 for his 
seven-round stoppage of Dwight Qawi on March 19, 1988. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another reason to like Marvelous Marvin Hagler is that he was loyal to his 
managers, the Petronelli brothers, in an era when most fighters dump them when 
they start making big money. . . .

Bad News, Good News for 2 Live Crew: Police vice squads aren't the only ones 
with a legal bone to pick with the controversial rap group 2 Live Crew. A 
federal court lawsuit is claiming that the rappers made an unauthorized 
derivative recording of Roy Orbison's "Oh, Pretty Woman." 
</P>
<P>
Acuff-Rose, a Nashville, Tenn., music publishing firm, said Monday that it 
refused permission to allow 2 Live Crew to record the song. However, a rap 
adaptation appeared on the group's album, "As Clean as They Wanna Be," the 
sanitized version of "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." "It's not about talking 
dirty," said Acuff-Rose spokesman Tom Adkinson. "It's about copyright 
infringement." The Nashville publishing firm asked for unspecified damages and 
for the removal of all copies of the album from stores. Spokesmen for the group 
and its label were not available for comment. . . . Meanwhile, the group also 
got some good news Monday. The Sacramento district attorney's office said that 
it did not find "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" to be obscene. The office had 
launched an investigation after recent moves to make the selling of the album 
illegal in three Southern Florida counties and in San Antonio, Tex. GREG

'Alien' Rescue: In the tradition of "Star Trek" and "Beauty and the Beast," a 
group of fans is trying to save Fox Television's canceled "Alien Nation." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers for Quality Television is launching a grass-roots effort to encourage 
fans to write 20th Century Fox President Barry Diller and ask him not to cancel 
the show. "Alien Nation" is the only Fox series on the VQT list of supported 
shows. Spokeswoman Dorothy Swanson said, "VQT feels that Fox made a tactical 
and public relations mistake in canceling this quality show, and believes that, 
with another chance, 'Alien Nation' could turn into a solid hit for that 
network." GREG BRAXTON

SURVIVORS TELL HOW REBELS KILLED 100 SRI LANKA POLICE 
</P>

AMPARAI, Sri Lanka 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was blindfolded, his arms were tied and he was forced face down in the dirt 
with more than 100 other police officers, but Alm Tahir says he was most 
frightened by the mocking laughter of his would-be executioners. 
</P>
<P>
"The women and girls were laughing and clapping," Tahir, 21, recalled Monday 
from his hospital bed here. "Then they shot us." 
</P>
<P>
Police Sub-Inspector Piyeratna Ranaweera remembers another sound when the 
shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was shouting for their loved ones," he said at another hospital. 
"Then there was silence." 
</P>
<P>
The two men are the only known survivors of an apparent massacre of Kalmunai 
police a week ago by Tamil separatist guerrillas. Though wounded, both escaped 
into the jungle before the guerrillas burned their colleagues' bodies, they 
said in separate interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Kalmunai, on Sri Lanka's east coast, was the opening shot in what threatens to 
be a brutal new phase of the civil war in this lush Indian Ocean nation. Citing 
more than 600 dead and two collapsed cease-fires in the last week, the 
government Monday declared total war on the Tamil guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, it is all-out war," Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told 
Parliament in Colombo, the capital. "We will annihilate the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Elam, take over the east and then go for the north." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, as they are called, are demanding a separate Tamil state in the 
north and east. They claim that the nation's Tamils, who are mostly Hindu and 
make up about 18% of Sri Lanka's population of 15 million, are discriminated 
against by the majority, mostly Buddhist Sinhalese. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 soldiers, rebels and civilians have died since the Tigers 
launched their first attacks in 1983. The beleaguered government turned to New 
Delhi for help in 1987, but the 50,000 Indian peacekeeping troops withdrew last 
March after failing to defeat the insurgent ethnic army. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, President Ranasinge Premadasa's government began negotiating a 
power-sharing arrangement and let the Tigers assume many military and civilian 
functions, with the hope they would put down their guns and campaign for 
elections. That fragile peace held until the Tigers' surprise offensive last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Wijeratne still held out the possibility of peace Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I advise the (Tigers) to stop the fighting and come to the negotiating table 
before it is too late," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But peace was hard to find near Kalmunai, about 200 miles east of Colombo, on 
Monday. The seaside town remained under the control of the Tigers, and the 
steady crump of mortar shells and the chatter of small arms fire filled the air 
at Malwate Junction, five miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby villages were deserted. Thousands of refugees were reported in makeshift 
shelters at schools, Buddhist temples and government facilities. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk, a light tank and four armored personnel carriers rushed fresh troops 
to the embattled area, past a tropical tableau of green rice paddies, dense 
jungle and waving coconut palms. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and police at sandbagged checkpoints said they fear that as many as 
750 other police officers also were killed when the Tigers broke the 
13-month-old truce last week and captured 17 police stations, including 
Kalmunai, in the north and east. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a single policeman from the stations has come out," said police officer 
Yumyu Mustaba, who was guarding the main road outside Amparai, the district 
seat. "All were rounded up. All are gone." 
</P>
<P>
"The police are all finished," said an army officer, who asked not to be 
identified. "They are dead." 
</P>
<P>
Fighting was also reported Monday at four army camps in the eastern Batticaloa 
district, and at Trincomalee, in the northeast, which suffered severe damage in 
fighting last week. 
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting also reportedly raged at the Kiran military camp, further 
north, where the military used helicopter gunships to repulse a dawn attack, 
according to the Defense Ministry. A ministry communique Monday said the Tigers 
had lobbed "chemical bombs . . . causing severe physical irritation" into the 
camp. No further details were available. 
</P>
<P>
The week of fighting dashed the tenuous peace that had reigned in Sri Lanka 
since last year, when a government-linked purge crippled a leftist insurgency 
among the majority Sinhalese. More than 30,000 people were reported killed in 
the two-front war last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Colombo said they see little hope of an early end to the 
bloodshed, now that the Tigers have gone back to war. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole phony peace of the last few months was based on the assumption that 
the Tigers would put down their arms," one diplomat said. "Instead, it's clear 
they simply used the last few months to build up their strength." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there are few illusions about the Tigers' intentions in Kalmunai. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sub-Inspector Ranaweera, interviewed in the Kandy General Hospital, 
about 50 miles west of Kalmunai, said several dozen heavily armed Tigers 
arrived at his police post a week ago and demanded that the officers turn over 
their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked us to surrender,' said the 23-year-old officer. "They said if we do 
nothing, they won't hurt us. And that once the government agrees to their 
demands, we will be released. So, we surrendered." 
</P>
<P>
Ranaweera, who was wounded in an arm and ear, said the Tigers loaded the police 
on three buses. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't say anything. They just counted us one by one," he said. "All 115 
were taken away." 
</P>
<P>
The buses were driven to a Tigers camp deep in the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
"When they got us to the camp, they took everyone's name and blindfolded us," 
said Tahir, who was hospitalized in Amparai. "Then they tied our hands behind 
our back and dragged us by the ankles on the ground. Then they shot us." 
</P>
<P>
Tahir, who was wounded in the hip and buttocks, pulled back his tattered shirt 
to show skin rubbed raw by the ground. Deep marks on his wrists indicated that 
he had been tied. 
</P>
<P>
Both men said they passed out and woke up in the bloody heap of bodies. Tahir 
said he hid all night in the jungle before making his way to government lines. 
As he left, he said, the Tigers returned with tires and fuel to burn the bodies 
and the buses. 
</P>
<P>
Tahir, still shuddering, said he only had one thought throughout the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to die," he said softly.

COMPLEX, COSTLY CLEANUPS MAY SNARL BASE CLOSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidio looks more like a park than a military base, with towering 
eucalyptus and cypress trees shading lush lawns and creeks winding through 
1,800 hilly acres above the Golden Gate Bridge and the Pacific Ocean. In fact, 
it soon will be a park: The Army plans to move out in 1995 and turn over the 
nation's oldest fort to the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, beneath the Presidio's greenery lie the products of decades of spills, 
leaks and ill-planned dumping of poisonous chemicals. An estimated 200 fuel 
tanks, many thought to be leaking, are buried at the base. There are three 
known sites of PCB spills as well as several uncharted landfills, their 
contents unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The Presidio is emblematic of the government's legacy at hundreds of federal 
facilities across the country, from Energy Department nuclear weapons 
laboratories and assembly plants to abandoned mines on Department of Interior 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Sam, who is supposed to enforce the environmental laws, is the country's 
worst polluter. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't understand their taxpayer dollars being used to create 
pollution," said Rep. Dennis E. Eckart (D-Ohio). "You have to end the federal 
government's attitude of 'do as I say, not as I do.' " 
</P>
<P>
The price of cleaning up toxic wastes at federal facilities nationwide -- 
perhaps a 30-year task -- has been estimated at between $140 billion and $200 
billion by the White House budget office. The Presidio cleanup alone is 
expected to cost $10 million to $80 million. At California's heavily 
industrialized military shipyards, air bases and weapons depots, the cleanup 
bill may climb into the billions. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the Pentagon studying closure of more than 120 domestic bases, 
pressure is building to speed investigations of the military's toxic problems 
and correct them before the facilities are transferred to civilian use. The 
trick will be finding the cash to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a problem of major proportions that has not been faced," said Rep. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), whose district includes the Presidio. "We have to 
clean up our mess, and we have to do it before we close these bases." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
17 Sites in California 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are the numbers worse than in California. The Environmental Protection 
Agency's list of Superfund sites names 17 Defense Department or Energy 
Department installations in California -- more than in any other state. The 
Superfund, a federal program set up in 1980 to pay for cleaning up the most 
dangerous hazardous-waste sites, identifies places that represent the greatest 
risk to public health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
By September, EPA officials hope to decide whether to propose adding the 
Presidio and 23 other federal installations in California to the Superfund 
sites. A further 154 federal facilities in the state must produce detailed 
reports on their toxic problems. The reports will be reviewed as the first step 
toward determining whether the facilities should be on the Superfund list. 
</P>
<P>
Wastes present at these facilities run from radium (a radioactive substance 
used for illuminated dials) to solvents, pesticides, coolants, paint scrapings 
and old fuel. Waste from these bases has flowed into waterways, settled into 
ground water and drifted into drinking water wells. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much left to be done before we have a complete picture of the 
contamination," said Julie K. Anderson, of the EPA's western regional 
headquarters in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Although private corporations spent much of the 1980s trying to clean the nests 
they had fouled, the military only now is coming to terms with decades of 
environmental abuses and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
The delay is due in part to the Defense Department's long-standing insistence 
that it was not subject to EPA regulation. That position changed in 1986 when 
Congress, over the Ronald Reagan Administration's objections, decided that 
contamination from military sources was, indeed, the EPA's business. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon lost that fight but continues to oppose congressional efforts to 
give state regulators the authority to impose fines and penalties on federal 
agencies that violate environmental laws. Pentagon officials argue that giving 
the states such power would inject politics into highly technical decisions and 
skew cleanup priorities toward those states with aggressive, publicity-seeking 
attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
As the severity of the problem becomes more and more apparent, the Pentagon 
lately has made some concessions to California. The Defense Department recently 
agreed to pay the state Department of Health Services to monitor military 
anti-pollution efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The fee will be only 1% of the cost of cleaning up the military installations, 
but the dollar amount could be large. The cost of removing toxics from 11 
Northern California naval bases alone will be $702.8 million, according to the 
Naval Facilities Engineering Command in San Bruno. That estimate could be 
"low," Randal A. Friedman, who is coordinator of cleanup efforts at Navy bases 
in the Bay Area, warned. 
</P>
<P>
Cleaning up Hunters Point naval shipyard, a Superfund site in San Francisco, 
will cost $94 million. At Moffett Naval Air Station in Mountain View, also on 
the Superfund list, the job is expected to cost $113 million. 
</P>
<P>
At McClellan Air Force Base outside Sacramento, officials have detected in 
ground water the solvent trichloroethylene (TCE), a suspected carcinogen, in 
concentrations up to 13,000 times the maximum safe level. The Air Force expects 
that cleanup bill to reach $100 million by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
TCE has also seeped into ground water below Norton Air Force Base at San 
Bernardino, one of the bases being considered for closure. "The question is not 
whether (TCE) will pollute additional wells but how long will it take for it to 
get there," said Lt. Mark Wright, chief of environmental planning at Norton. 
The Norton cleanup is expected to cost $44 million or more and take decades. 
</P>
<P>
State toxic waste regulators doubt that any of the military bases in California 
conceals an environmental horror story on the order of Love Canal or the 
Stringfellow Acid Pits, but officials have discovered that finding and fixing 
contamination at a military installation is more complex than at most private 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bases) are basically like small cities. They handle everything. They have 
sewer systems. They have underground tanks. They have landfills," said Donald 
Dawlke, chief of the toxic cleanup division the San Francisco Bay Regional 
Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
There are also more types of pollutants. While a company may pollute ground 
water with pesticides, PCBs or solvents, military bases used, slopped and 
dumped the whole spectrum of all-too-familiar toxins along with other, more 
exotic poisons. 
</P>
<P>
At Hunters Point, for example, asbestos, heavy metals, radioactive radium dials 
and sand and paint chips from the sandblasted hulls of ships were dumped to 
fill in 20 acres of tidal lands in San Francisco Bay, in the next cove over 
from Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy left Hunters Point in the mid-1970s and contracted out its ship repair 
business to a local company, Triple A Machine Shop Inc. The San Francisco 
district attorney is prosecuting Triple A on 16 felony counts of illegal 
dumping at Hunters Point. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Navy is back, embarking on an ambitious plan to clean the base. But 
Friedman, the coordinator of the naval cleanup in the Bay Area, said that EPA 
cleanup procedures are cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of study you have to do is incredible," Friedman said. "The process 
is inherently slanted to the conservative side. You don't want to remove 15 
feet of dirt and find out a few years later you should have removed 20 feet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Atomic Fallout Waste 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boxer has called on the EPA to investigate what may be a byproduct 
of the problems left by Hunters Point. In the years after World War II, ships 
contaminated by fallout from atomic tests in the Bikini Atoll were cleaned at 
Hunters Point. 
</P>
<P>
Each year in the 1950s, sandblast waste, paint chips and other radioactive 
trash were encased in concrete-lined drums, shipped 50 miles off San Francisco 
on barges and dumped into the ocean near the Farallon Islands. Now, the drums 
are feared to be leaking into what has been a rich fishery. 
</P>
<P>
Military waste is not confined to federal bases and dumps. Over the years, the 
Defense Reutilization and Marketing Services has sold old chemicals as surplus. 
In several instances, chemicals bought for a few cents on the dollar have come 
to haunt local officials. 
</P>
<P>
At a congressional hearing earlier this year in Sacramento, Los Angeles 
officials told of their continuing efforts to reclaim port-owned land in 
Wilmington where a local businessman stored 40,000 gallons of stale solvents, 
paints, batteries and decontaminants used on chemical warfare components. Some 
of the materials were sold by the El Toro Marine Base in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
David McKenna, a deputy Los Angeles city attorney, estimated that the city has 
already spent $650,000 on the Wilmington cleanup. If the chemicals seep into 
ground water, the cost could exceed $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Solano County is prosecuting a man who bought 35,000 gallons of highly 
poisonous and explosive chemicals at military auctions, starting in 1976, in 
the hope of reselling them. They were stored in a barn near Collinsville, on 
the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals, discovered last year, came from nearby military installations. 
The cost of cleaning up the site topped $1 million, Solano County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Mark Pollock said. 
</P>
<P>
"One spark, and there would have been a hole 200 feet wide. It would have wiped 
out the town of Collinsville," Pollock said. 
</P>
<P>
He and other local and state officials lamented that the law generally 
precludes local authorities from prosecuting the federal agencies responsible 
for selling hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
California has sued to force compliance with state laws in the handling of 
toxic substances at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, near Vallejo, and at Ft. 
Ord, near Monterey. But courts have ruled that the state cannot collect money 
from federal facilities that mishandle toxics. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the state Department of Health Services has the authority to inspect 
federal bases and issue citations. Health officials have found that some 
military officials still have not learned any lesson from the past. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of actions that ended in March, the state Department of Health 
Services cited Mare Island Naval Shipyard, a submarine repair base at the 
northeastern tip of San Francisco Bay, for sloppy handling of wastes. 
</P>
<P>
State inspectors found 13 violations. Two concrete tanks holding 525,000 
gallons of toxins were leaking. A barge held 20,000 gallons of waste oil. If 
the drums ruptured, there was nothing to keep the waste from flowing into San 
Francisco Bay. Perhaps most troubling was that the tanks had been in place 
without proper permits for 13 years and may have been leaking all the while. 
</P>
<P>
"This is relatively routine for federal facilities," said Howard Hatayama of 
the health department's toxic control program. 
</P>
<P>
As the Defense Department studies closing 121 bases around the country, the 
issue of toxics at military bases will loom ever larger. And, if the past is a 
guide, the cost of decontamination will be dear. 
</P>
<P>
In the Marin County town of Novato, two developers in 1985 agreed to pay $45 
million for 400 acres at Hamilton Field, used over the years by the Navy, Air 
Force and Army. But escrow has not yet closed because a 26-acre toxic dump at 
the center of the 400 acres has not been cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Boxer said, those 26 acres most likely will have to be fenced off 
and abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The news that Moffett Naval Air Station, in Silicon Valley, might be closed was 
cheered not only by peace activists (who said it could prove that closing a 
base could benefit the local economy), but by developers also. They saw the 
land reborn as a meticulously planned community with trails fronting San 
Francisco Bay, reclaimed wetlands, a space museum and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
But toxins buried at Moffett threaten to delay any such conversion. The Navy's 
preliminary assessment is that wastes probably have leaked into the ground from 
unlined holding ponds and cracked fuel tanks. Several landfills also contain 
hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Moffett's fences is another Superfund site, one polluted by 
semiconductor manufacturers. These companies say that efforts to clean the 
plume of contaminated ground water have been stalled, first by Navy reluctance 
to acknowledge that it contributed to the problem and now by the Navy's lengthy 
study process. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to start (the cleanup) right now," said Charles Bostic of 
Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. Until Moffett identifies its pollution sources, 
however -- a process that may take two or three years longer -- the companies 
will not begin a cleanup for fear of aggravating a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy is moving as fast as it can, Navy official Richard Seraydarian said. 
He cited complex federal laws governing cleanup bidding practices. "We have a 
lot more hoops to jump through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the bases being considered for closure, none holds more promise than the 
Presidio. Most of the complex will be left as a park. It is unclear what will 
become of the grand officers' quarters, golf course and tennis courts, but 
among the suggestions is one that part of the grounds be leased to a 
university. 
</P>
<P>
The military museum probably will remain and perhaps be expanded. The Presidio 
was first held by the Spanish in 1776, then by Mexico and, finally, by the U.S. 
Army. As the oldest military base in continuous operation in the United States, 
much of its history is clouded and details of its waste problem are not known. 
For example: There are three Nike missile silos on the base, but their contents 
are unknown. The doors are welded shut. 
</P>
<P>
Although transforming the garrison into a park is "the chance of a lifetime," 
said Brian O'Neill, director of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and 
the official in charge of planning the Presidio's future, the Army must first 
clean it up. He said the issue is "at the top" of his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Studies conducted at the Presidio last year by Argonne National Laboratory and 
the Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency found "no imminent or substantial 
threat to human life or the environment." 
</P>
<P>
But the reports went on to say there are more than 200 underground fuel and 
storage tanks at the base, that the locations and contents of many of them are 
not known "with any reliability," and that some of them probably are leaking. 
</P>
<P>
Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), a suspected carcinogen used widely to cool 
electrical transformers, was spilled in at least three spots, and soldiers 
dumped trash at some landfills not yet identified. A 1984 Army study found TCE 
and other chemicals suspected of causing cancer or congenital defects in ground 
water beneath the Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
The worst known contamination is at and near Crissy Field, where San Francisco 
holds its Fourth of July celebrations. The Argonne report predicted that toxins 
under the old landing strip will not reach the drinking water supply, but it 
warned that the "ultimate discharge point of this ground water is San Francisco 
Bay, and marine organisms are thus threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Saul Bloom of the Arms Control Research Center, a private group that advocates 
converting military facilities to civilian use, said of the Presidio: "We might 
have the first national park listed on Superfund."

EN HOD, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actually, there are two En Hods, but one is almost invisible. 
</P>
<P>
The older En Hod, now an Israeli artists' colony, is a village of picturesque 
stone houses set on a wooded hill. It is just off the old Haifa road and is 
clearly marked with a sign to attract tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The other En Hod, an Arab village, is also set among trees, but there the 
similarity ends. There are no signs along the road that leads to it, and it 
does not appear on maps. There is no electricity. Sewage flows into the open 
and down a ravine from a makeshift system of pipes. The streets are unpaved 
and, in the summer, dusty: Appalachia on the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The founders of this En Hod were once residents of what is now the artists' 
colony, and their story has become a symbol of frustration for Arabs all over 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
They fled their homes 42 years ago, during the Israeli War of Independence, 
expecting to return when the war ended. But the new Israeli state has not 
permitted them to return. Israeli painters took over the picturesque houses and 
turned them into studios. 
</P>
<P>
Not only have they been prevented from going home, they have been denied 
municipal status for their new village, and this means no electricity, no 
sewers, no proper schools. 
</P>
<P>
They are refugees in their own country, experiencing in the extreme what many 
Israeli Arabs have come to know: that they do not belong and never will, that 
although they can vote they will never really be part of a Jewish state that is 
in conflict with the Arab world outside -- and within. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed abu Elhijeh, who was born in the older En Hod and is the son of a 
village leader, recently told a reporter: "We want to know, finally, are we 
citizens of this state or not? We want to know, what is the difference between 
us and our neighbors?" 
</P>
<P>
Such questions are being asked more and more by Arabs and Jews in Israel. For 
years, they could be dismissed. But the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip has begun to spill over into Israel proper, not just into the 
streets but into the minds of the 650,000 Arab citizens of Israel. There is 
concern that Israel's Arabs may be drifting into permanent alienation. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab awakening is matched on the Jewish side by hardened attitudes and 
growing suspicion. A poll published at Haifa University recently showed that a 
majority of Israeli Jews favor a ban on Arab representation in the Knesset, the 
Parliament. Three out of four Israeli Jews said they would not work for an 
Arab. 
</P>
<P>
On both sides, the ill feeling has been manifested in hostile words, and in 
some cases, acts. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Arab Israel erupted in unusual violence after an Israeli gunman 
shot and killed seven Palestinian workers at the town of Rishon Le Zion. Masked 
youths hurled stones and gasoline bombs at cars, smashed windows and displayed 
the outlawed flag of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
In Nazareth, the largest Arab city outside Jerusalem, arsonists burned down a 
bank. In Lod, Ramle and Haifa, Arabs took to the streets for the first time in 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned: "I think it ought to be said to the Arabs 
considered citizens of Israel that yesterday and the day before they passed the 
limit of what is allowed. . . . I really hope this won't repeat itself." 
</P>
<P>
The violence came on the heels of a series of nationalistic signals: incidents 
of arson, discovery of an Arab summer camp where Palestinian political songs 
and lore were taught, the appearance of anti-Israeli graffiti on walls, polls 
showing that most Israeli Arabs want a Palestinian state alongside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, some Israeli politicians have made explicit their feelings that 
their Arab fellow citizens are nothing of the sort. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the mayor of the Galilee town of Carmiel complained that Arabs 
were moving in at an alarming rate, threatening the Jewish majority. A Likud 
Party candidate for mayor of Acre campaigned on a promise to expel Arabs from 
the city's historic Crusader-era core. (He lost; Arabs voted overwhelmingly for 
his opponent.) 
</P>
<P>
Colliding attitudes reached a political peak in April when Shimon Peres, leader 
of the Labor Party, came close to unseating Prime Minister Shamir, head of 
Likud. Peres, a leading dove, appeared to have lined up just enough votes in 
the Knesset to take power, among them seven seats held by Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Likud leaders tried to put pressure on supporters of Peres by charging that his 
majority was "non-Jewish," meaning dependent on Arabs. The anti-Arab charge was 
led by Likud's Ehud Olmert, who, ironically, was then the minister in charge of 
Arab welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Peres' majority disappeared for other reasons. He was abandoned by members of 
religious parties who disagreed with his dovish line on settling the 
Palestinian conflict. But the message to Israeli Arabs was clear: Although they 
hold full voting rights, they may not decide the makeup of Israel's government. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a costly event for Israel," said Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist 
at Hebrew University. "The Arabs were told they are not legitimate. It 
confirmed their feelings of inferiority." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics tell a depressing tale of Arab life in Israel. The rate of Arab 
unemployment is estimated at more than 20%, more than twice the national rate. 
Half of the 600,000 Israelis who live below the poverty line are Arab. Five 
percent of university students are Arab, although the percentage of Arabs in 
the population at large is 18%. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Rishon Le Zion incident, Israeli authorities have gone to great 
lengths to counter the argument that Arabs are second-class citizens. Officials 
take pains to point out that Arabs in Israel are better off than many Arab 
citizens of neighboring states. If Arab income is only two-thirds the income of 
Jews, they say, it is because they started at a lower level. The reduced 
municipal budgets for Arab towns are explained by the lower taxes collected 
from the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Jews and Arabs agree that one obstacle to Arab progress in everything 
from social welfare to education to acceptance in high-security jobs is their 
exemption from military conscription. 
</P>
<P>
The army in Israel is not just a military force; military service represents a 
kind of passage to citizenship, a communal rite that conveys full identity with 
the state. A Jewish Israeli who refuses to serve faces ostracism. Arabs, 
already looked on with suspicion, are excluded from this most respected of 
national institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Arabs are not drafted, although some Bedouins and Druze, the latter an offshoot 
sect of Islam, volunteer and serve in special units. No specific numbers are 
available, but the few other Arabs who volunteer for the army are almost all 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Several right-wing politicians have suggested that Arabs not be allowed to vote 
because they do not perform military service. Arab politicians are more 
ambivalent, especially so because the army is used to suppress the Palestinian 
revolt against Israeli rule. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the surface give-and-take over the rights and responsibilities of Arab 
citizens, there are other contradictions. A few years ago, a survey of Israelis 
showed that while 60% wanted to burden Arabs with the same national obligations 
as Jews, fewer than half supported equal rights for them. 
</P>
<P>
Many Arabs have come to believe that they will always be pushed to the back of 
the line, be it for jobs or, as in the case of En Hod, common services. 
</P>
<P>
"We all work in Israel," said Abu Elhijeh, the village leader's son. "We travel 
around and see what is going on. We want to live like other people, like the 
rest of the Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
En Hod was a Crusader outpost that was settled by Arabs in the distant past. In 
1948, when Britain abandoned its hold on Palestine and Israelis and Arabs went 
to war, the families of En Hod conducted raids on the nearby highway to Haifa. 
Armed Israelis took over the village, and most of the residents took refuge 
abroad or with families elsewhere in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But one clan stayed on, on nearby land used for grazing, and formed the nucleus 
of the new En Hod. 
</P>
<P>
These people raised goats and grew olives and were generally ignored by the 
government. Then, in the 1970s, the state put up a fence to keep the village 
from expanding. Trees were planted for a new national park, and the shade of 
these trees killed the olive trees. Goats were forbidden on grounds that they 
damaged the environment. 
</P>
<P>
But the Arabs persisted, and they found a loophole in the building 
restrictions: The fence meant to hem them in obstructed only the march of the 
village up the mountain. The ravine was left unfenced, and the residents began 
to build down, often at impossible angles. 
</P>
<P>
"It took three years to lay the foundation of a house because we had to scrape 
away at the mountainside," Abu Elhijeh said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the village began to lobby for municipal status for its 130 residents. 
This seemed to awaken the government to the existence of Arab En Hod, and it 
was to the village's disadvantage. Instead of helping out, officials sent word 
that three new houses would be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
A sit-in and a sympathetic campaign on television and in newspapers saved the 
houses. But the publicity awakened other Arab communities with similar 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that restrictions on the growth of Arab communities had led to a 
spate of illegal building nationwide. About 40 communities banded together with 
En Hod to solve a problem common to them all, the lack of services. The 
campaign was backed by the New Israel Fund, a North American and Israeli group 
that supports community work and promotes democracy in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Arabs complained that smaller Israeli villages get full services. Also, 
remote Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip are provided 
with roads, water and electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The government says it is studying the requests for recognition, but it points 
out that many of the Arab settlements are scattered and that jurisdictional 
problems abound. Six thousand Arab houses were built illegally, officials 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, there will be no choice; the settlements will be recognized and 
included in some municipality," said Ilan Cohen, an official in the Arab 
Affairs Ministry. He did not venture to guess when that might be. 
</P>
<P>
The common effort of En Hod and the other Arab communities has had a chilling 
effect on the Jews of old En Hod. After years of paying lip service to the 
Arabs' complaints, they have grown hostile now that the Arabs are flexing their 
political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"They are being exploited by leftists and don't know how to stop it," said Mara 
Ben-Dov, a painter, sculptor and 16-year resident of En Hod. 
</P>
<P>
Like others, Ben-Dov fears that recognition of the Arab village will somehow 
mushroom into mass urbanization and clutter the landscape with chicken coops 
and auto repair shops. As it is, En Hod is in dispute with a neighboring Jewish 
kibbutz over the farmers' plans to build a food processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel bad at living in a home that used to be Arab," Ben-Dov said. "All 
Israel was once Arab, so it's impossible to think like that. These things 
happen in war. Look, my parents were refugees, my mother from Austria, my 
father from Yugoslavia. My grandparents were killed by the Nazis. We never got 
anything from it all." 
</P>
<P>
It was a Saturday, and old En Hod was filling up with day trippers pouring out 
of buses. At the Bonanza Restaurant, which used to be the village mosque, the 
pianist, a recent immigrant from the Soviet Union, was playing "Strangers in 
the Night." 
</P>
<P>
The call of the muezzin from less than two miles away, in the other En Hod, 
could be heard, summoning the faithful to mid-day prayers at the mosque the 
villagers have built to replace the old one.

U.S. WILL RELAX MOST HIGH-TECH EXPORT CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration announced Monday that it plans to end Cold War-era 
requirements that U.S. firms obtain export licenses on most of the 
high-technology goods that they ship to other Western countries -- a move that 
will affect about $30-billion worth of trade. 
</P>
<P>
The order, which will become effective in two weeks, is the first formal step 
that the Administration has taken to ease export-licensing requirements on U.S. 
trade with the Western allies, a relaxation that American business has sought 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials said that the deregulation primarily will affect 
three major categories of exports -- computers, semiconductor-manufacturing 
equipment and telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export administration, said that 
the elimination of requirements for export licenses will ease the 
administrative burden for U.S. firms and make them more competitive within the 
Western alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, partly to help ensure that buyers do not re-export the strategic 
technology they receive, the regulations require U.S. exporters to keep on file 
basic information about the firm that is purchasing their products. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, initial reaction from the business community was lukewarm. William 
T. Archey, international vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said 
that the easing is welcome but that it is "tempered" by the requirement for 
added data. He branded the action "an interim step." 
</P>
<P>
The move was taken on the heels of a June 7 agreement by the United States and 
its major allies on a sweeping overhaul of Western restrictions on 
high-technology exports to the Soviet Bloc, expected to ease the way for sales 
of goods needed to modernize Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Congress also is moving to force the Administration to liberalize its rules. 
The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act ordered the White House to streamline previous 
rules. And a new bill by Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) would eliminate all such 
licensing requirements by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
However, Administration policy-makers said that the process was speeded up by 
the allies' accord on East-West trade and by the faster-than-expected movement 
within the European Community to create a single, integrated European market by 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States had not relaxed its restrictions on exports to other 
Western allies, it could have left American producers facing a two-tiered 
export-control process in which U.S. firms were put at a visible disadvantage 
against European firms in their product lines. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the United States next must make sure that its own 
regulations are consistent with those of other Western countries so that the 
allies can adopt common security standards for high-tech exports by next April 
30, as promised. 
</P>
<P>
The relaxation announced Monday will have no impact on current requirements 
that firms obtain licenses when the products they are selling to a Western 
country are to be re-exported to a former Soviet Bloc nation. In such 
instances, previous rules remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that they probably will have to draft special procedures 
for technology and equipment that is destined for East Germany -- particularly 
if that country's scheduled reunification with West Germany is accelerated, as 
seems more and more likely. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials estimated that the relaxation announced Monday 
would eliminate the need for about 20,000 of the 25,000 licenses that the 
agency issued in 1989 for exports to Western countries, including 90% of those 
for semiconductor-manufacturing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe is now opening up, but exports to Western allies still account 
for virtually all the trade in strategically sensitive technology. The United 
States has been among the most stringent of the Western allies in regulating 
the flow of such goods. 
</P>
<P>
The June 7 accord signed by members of the 17-country Coordinating Committee on 
Multilateral Export Controls, known as Cocom, relaxes restrictions on East 
European countries that agree to help enforce Cocom rules. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have agreed to follow Western 
enforcement procedures. U.S. officials said Monday that a team of American 
advisers will travel to those three countries in late summer to set up liaison 
offices and provide on-site inspection.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR;

<P>
BOTH WILSON, FEINSTEIN SEEN AS ALLIES BY LOCAL LEADERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Californians in November will elect a former big-city mayor as governor for the 
first time in more than half a century, to the delight of problem-plagued 
leaders of California's 58 counties and 456 cities who look forward to having 
an experienced ally of local government in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
They will have such a friend regardless whether California voters choose former 
San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, a Republican U.S. senator, or former San Francisco 
Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat. Both nominees have already pledged to 
develop a stronger, more sympathetic relationship between state and local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
If they can deliver, their proposals could lead to the most significant 
realignment of governmental powers in California in decades, and certainly 
since the passage in 1978 of Proposition 13, the property tax-cutting 
initiative that precipitated a major shift of power and finance from city halls 
and county courthouses to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson left the state Assembly in 1971 to win election as mayor of San Diego, 
serving in that post through 1982. Feinstein was the chairman of the San 
Francisco city-county Board of Supervisors in November of 1978 when Mayor 
George Moscone was shot to death, and she automatically succeeded to the 
mayor's office. Feinstein subsequently won election to two full terms ending in 
early 1988. Wilson has been president of the League of California Cities, and 
Feinstein has been a league board member. Since San Francisco is both a city 
and a county, her administration also was active in the County Supervisors 
Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates have made strong statements of support for local government 
programs. Each has vowed to stop the Legislature's practice of dumping 
additional responsibilities onto cities and counties without giving them the 
money or revenue sources to finance such duties. Each has promised to establish 
an intergovernmental structure to involve cities and counties in the formation 
of state policy and budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has gone further than Wilson in supporting the goals of the county 
supervisors -- to suggest, for example, that the state take over all financing 
and administration of welfare from the counties. Wilson told The Times last 
week that he opposes such a move and is more inclined to decentralize welfare 
administration to give counties more discretion in running the system. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates also differ over the creation of a split property assessment 
roll to require businesses to bear a bigger share of the property tax burden 
than residences. Feinstein has said a split roll "makes a lot of sense to me." 
Wilson opposed the split roll because, he said, heavier business taxes would be 
bad for economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Their differences, however, do not dampen the enthusiasm of local officials for 
having two nominees for governor who have experienced their problems firsthand 
as local administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Donald C. Benninghoven, executive director of the League of California Cities, 
said, "They have been on the firing line. They have been major managers of an 
urban area. They understand what it's all about. We're just delighted to work 
with both candidates in coming to grips with issues that need to be dealt 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Larry E. Naake, Benninghoven's counterpart at the County Supervisors Assn., 
said that George Deukmejian also pledged to work closely with local government 
when he became governor in 1983. He established a local-government liaison in 
the Office of Planning and Research. The system "worked pretty well for a 
couple of years, but now has just sort of petered out," Naake said. While the 
local government emissary was a member of the governor's staff, the office was 
in a building away from the Capitol and did not have the access to power 
enjoyed by staff members within the governor's Capitol compound. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has endorsed the supervisors' proposal for a state-local government 
commission that would be involved in the governor's budget process. Naake noted 
that about $13 billion of the current $42-billion state general fund budget 
"finds its way to or through the counties, but we're out of the process." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has talked of creating a body similar to the federal Advisory Commission 
on Intergovernmental Relations with a less-direct role than the supervisors' 
proposal. But in a meeting with California county sheriffs last week, Wilson 
pledged, if elected, to meet with supervisors and other county representatives 
to review the existing structure of government. 
</P>
<P>
"What we intend to do is make sense of what now makes no sense," Wilson said. 
"It makes no sense for Butte County to be on the verge of bankruptcy, saved 
only by a one-time infusion of state funds. What makes sense is to reorder 
priorities and to say that county governments are to do those things that are 
most important. And the most important in my judgment is public safety." 
</P>
<P>
Benninghoven said the form of the bureaucratic structure is less important than 
the governor's personal commitment to the concept. "The best relationship we 
ever had was way back with Pat Brown when cities and counties sat with the 
Cabinet at regular monthly Cabinet meetings," he said, referring to the 
governorship of Edmund G. Brown, 1959-67. "That has never happened before -- or 
since." 
</P>
<P>
The major problem facing counties is the growth of programs such as welfare and 
the courts. A constitutional mandate that the state pay for new or expanded 
services it requires of local government does not apply to such big-ticket 
programs. Naake said that 65% to 70% of all county income was spent on state 
services 20 years ago. Today, the figure has grown to 95% while county income 
has declined. This has put the squeeze on traditional county services such as 
law enforcement, libraries, parks and health care. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just totally eroding our ability to deal with local demands and local 
services," Naake said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1972 state law incorporated into the state Constitution by the Gann 
spending-limit initiative of 1979 prohibits the Legislature from imposing new 
services from local government without also financing them. But the Legislature 
often skirts the requirement by declaring new laws exempt from the financing 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wilson and Feinstein have promised to end this practice, with Wilson 
vowing to veto any bill that puts a new duty on local government without 
providing the needed money. Feinstein has said there is a need for "reliable 
funding for the mandates so that counties won't have to divert money from 
sheriff patrols, fire protection and other vital day-to-day services to pay for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has not said just where the state would get the money. But in an 
appearance before county supervisors during the primary campaign, she said, 
"There can be much more discretion in deciding on what priorities should be 
addressed and what funds should be used." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has said major savings can be achieved through cost controls in the 
provision of medical services to the poor and through preventive health care. 
And local government must be given more authority to set its own spending 
priorities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of Proposition 13 restrictions, the cities have more authority to 
raise needed revenue than do the counties. Thus, the municipalities' financial 
problems are not as severe. The major challenge facing cities in the 1990s is 
growth management, Benninghoven said. "That will require a very close and very 
sensitive new and more effective relationship between state and local 
government. That's going to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the state will have to provide local government with 
long-range direction in the field of land-use planning, Benninghoven said, 
adding: "That's where the state is going to be spending a lot of its 
policy-direction time. . . . I think both candidates frankly realize that."

DRUG CZAR ASSAILS STATE'S NARCOTICS LAWS AS TOO WEAK 
</P>

<P>
Federal drug czar William J. Bennett lectured California legislators Monday, 
criticizing their anti-drug legislation as too weak and deserving of no better 
than a C-minus on the narcotics-fighting grade scale. 
</P>
<P>
"When is the Legislature going to act for the people and govern in a sensible 
way?" Bennett asked at a Capitol press conference during a one-day visit to 
Sacramento. "The Legislature has failed its responsibility for passing tough 
laws. Republicans and some Democrats want to get tough laws through, but 
they've been blocked." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in a speech to the Senate, the director of the federal Office of Drug 
Control Policy said that the most important thing the state can do is to 
increase the penalties for drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"State sentences for drug crimes are much more lenient than federal sentences," 
Bennett said. "California has not met its responsibility to enact tough 
sentencing laws. Thirty-five states have tougher sentencing laws -- and no 
state has more reason for a tough law than California." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said California ought to get tougher on users as well as traffickers. 
He said the state should revoke the professional and driver's licenses of 
convicted drug users and encourage private companies contracting with the state 
to begin drug-testing their employees. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested also that the Legislature recriminalize the possession of small 
amounts of marijuana. "The law is far too lenient. Most people get started on 
hard drugs through marijuana," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats reacted with skepticism. "There have been a number of laws already 
passed to increase the penalties on drug traffickers," said Sen. Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward), chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "But I'm not willing to 
assume that whatever the federal law is we should adopt it. 
</P>
<P>
"I would estimate that Bennett's recommendations would cost about $5 billion," 
Lockyer said. "I want to ask which tax he wants to raise to pay for that." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters also asked Bennett how the state could afford to implement his 
program at a time when California prisons are filled to 175% of capacity and 
the state faces a $3.6-billion budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
He replied that the federal government, which has more than doubled its 
spending on anti-drug programs in California, would help pay for the increased 
law enforcement costs. He also suggested that the state could pay for some of 
the programs by stepping up efforts to seize the assets of convicted drug 
dealers. But he added that the Legislature would have to "readjust your 
spending" to construct more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Bennett praised some California anti-drug programs, such as 
a recent law that regulates the sale of chemicals that could be used to 
manufacture drugs. He also singled out for praise Los Angeles' DARE program, 
which sends police officers into schools to warn students about the dangers of 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
But Bennett said California was not doing enough to combat drugs. He blamed 
this failure on "the obvious resistance from a number of legislators" and such 
liberal lobbying groups as the American Civil Liberties Union.

ASSEMBLY SETS STAGE FOR NEW BUDGET TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURE: BOTH HOUSES APPROVE FUNDS TO RESUME PAYMENTS OF TAX REFUNDS AND 
RENTER'S CREDITS. BUT REPUBLICANS KEEP BILL FROM GOING TO GOVERNOR.

<P>
The Assembly passed and sent to the Senate a $56-billion state budget Monday, 
setting the stage for creation of a two-house negotiating committee that will 
do the hard bargaining needed to close a $3.6-billion revenue gap. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the budget, which had been defeated last Thursday, came on a 54 to 
20 vote that barely gave it the two-thirds majority needed for approval. 
</P>
<P>
The spending plan, opposed by Republicans because they say it cannot be 
balanced without a tax increase, was sent to the Senate for a procedural vote 
required to create the six-member conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, both the Senate and Assembly approved a much-delayed 
$332-million emergency appropriations bill that would allow the state to resume 
payments of tax refunds and renter's credits to more than 300,000 Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans in the Assembly kept the bill from going to the governor because 
some of the money in the legislation would be used to pay for abortions for 
poor women and they want another chance to vote on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted first, passing the appropriations bill 27 to 4. The 
legislation was then rushed to the Assembly, where in a quick vote it was 
approved 56 to 3. However, Republicans complained later that the vote was taken 
so quickly it caught some GOP lawmakers off guard. Democrats agreed to give the 
Republicans a second chance to vote on the measure when the Assembly reconvenes 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Action on the emergency appropriations bill came about two hours after the 
Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, where the legislation has been 
stalled since Thursday, unanimously approved the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The way for passage of the emergency legislation was cleared after Finance 
Director Jesse R. Huff sent a "clarification" letter to committee members 
saying the Deukmejian Administration fully supports the legislation, including 
a $34-million appropriation that will allow resumption of payment of all tax 
refunds and renter's credits. 
</P>
<P>
A Department of Finance official testified last week during the committee 
hearing that the Administration would like additional renter's credit 
appropriations rolled over into the new fiscal year that will begin July 1. The 
reasoning then was that such a move would give the state a stronger financial 
cushion during the current budget year. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Monday, Assistant Finance Director Cynthia Katz said the 
Administration had never intended to hold up the legislation. The extra 
appropriation for the renter's credit was not debated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As for the main budget bill, a group of Republicans once again tried to block 
its passage, as they did Thursday, warning that its approval would be a 
prescription for a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
But Republican leaders joined Democrats Monday in voting for the $56-billion 
budget -- which is about $2.6 billion higher than Gov. George Deukmejian's 
proposed budget -- in order to get conference committee negotiations under way. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for passage of the budget bill, Assemblyman William P. Baker 
(R-Danville) vowed that he will work to close the $3.6-billion revenue gap 
through budget cuts. "We are never going to approve a tax increase," Baker 
promised. "Never." 
</P>
<P>
But other Republicans said they did not believe him. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), openly critical of GOP 
leadership, said, "I am very skeptical of any agreement between the current 
leadership and the governor. I believe that every indication is (the agreement) 
will be some very large permanent tax increases in exchange for some cosmetic 
and face-saving changes in welfare COLAS (cost of living adjustments)." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), on the losing side of the vote with 
McClintock, said even though the budget will undergo substantial revisions over 
the next two weeks, "We want to stop it now before there is a tax increase."

SENATE PANEL OKS SUPERFUND BILL FOR WORK ON OIL SPILLS; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: INDUSTRY LOBBYING IS UNSUCCESSFUL. ACTION ON SIMILAR BILLS IS 
PENDING IN STATE LEGISLATURE.

Oil company lobbyists turned out in force Monday but failed to stop a key 
Senate committee from approving a bill to create a $150-million "superfund" 
plus an unlimited line of credit backed by oil company resources that the state 
could use to clean up oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, another Senate committee postponed action on a similar 
Assembly-passed bill. This measure would create a $64-million superfund and a 
$1-billion line of credit for state borrowing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gov. George Deukmejian has an oil spill cleanup plan, which is 
languishing in an Assembly committee. 
</P>
<P>
The outpouring of bills was sparked by the 1989 Exxon spill in Alaska and the 
British Petroleum spill off Huntington Beach earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators in a two-house conference committee will try to resolve differences 
and produce a compromise bill. 
</P>
<P>
By a 9-2 vote, the Appropriations Committee approved a bill by Senate Majority 
Leader Barry Keene (D-Benicia) to levy a 25-cents-per-barrel tax on all oil 
except that produced by small independents or so-called "mom and pop" 
operations that turn out less than 500 barrels per day. The Keene bill now 
proceeds to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the lack of a quorum, the Senate Natural Resources Committee delayed a 
vote for at least one week on a rival measure sponsored by Assemblyman Ted 
Lempert (D-San Mateo), chairman of the Select Committee on Oil Spill Prevention 
and Response Preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
It would impose an 18-cents-per-barrel surcharge on all oil passing through 
California ports to raise the $64 million and set up the $1-billion line of 
credit for borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
It also would create a new state office to coordinate all oil spill response 
efforts, require tanker safety plans at every oil transfer terminal and require 
unannounced tanker inspections. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's plan, embodied in a bill carried by Assemblyman Eric Seastrand 
(R-Salinas), calls for a $30-million oil spill cleanup superfund financed by an 
oil tax. 
</P>
<P>
It also would require oil companies to demonstrate that they have $500 million 
worth of oil spill liability protection in order to move their product through 
California waters. The state Department of Fish and Game would become the lead 
agency in implementing the law. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen oil company lobbyists showed up for the Senate committee 
hearing on the Keene bill because of the high monetary stakes involved. 
</P>
<P>
Tam Poland of Shell Oil Co. opposed the broad-based tax, arguing, "The more 
often you risk the shoreline, the more often you should pay." 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) shot back, "No matter how you 
see it, we (the consumers) will pay the tax at the (gasoline) pump." 
</P>
<P>
Lifting the cap on the borrowing power was strongly supported by Corey Brown of 
the Planning and Conservation League, who testified: "An oil spill cleanup 
could cost billions of dollars. We want to make sure that the oil industry -- 
not the taxpayers -- pays that cost." 
</P>
<P>
The amendment lifting the cap won on a 7-1 vote.

CAMARENA MURDER TRIAL LIVES UP TO EXPECTATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE JUDGE HAD PROMISED THE PROSPECTIVE JURORS THAT THE PROCEEDING, WHICH 
WILL RESUME TODAY, WOULD BE A MOST INTERESTING CASE. HE WASN'T WRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the first day of trial of four men charged in the murder of U.S. drug agent 
Enrique Camarena, a federal judge in Los Angeles told prospective jurors that 
it would be "one of the most interesting cases on which you will have the 
opportunity to serve." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie's statement was no exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
During the first four weeks of the Camarena trial, jurors have heard about 
powerful, swaggering drug dealers, including one who kept a lion at his house; 
corrupt police officials, including one who "got loaded" on cocaine at a 
narcotics trafficker's home; and a tense standoff between heavily armed 
bodyguards of a drug kingpin and Mexican law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
They have heard an American woman's tearful description of her unsuccessful 
attempt to find her husband after he disappeared in Guadalajara; and the almost 
casual confession of a courier that he transported, by car, $150 million in 
drug sale proceeds from the United States to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
And they listened to wrenching tapes of Drug Enforcement Administration Agent 
Camarena, then 37, pleading with his killers not to torture him anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was in recess for most of last week and is to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Mexican government has reopened its investigation of the 
February, 1985, Guadalajara murders of Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala 
Avelar, as embarrassing allegations about ties between Mexican police officials 
and drug traffickers are raised continually in the courtroom. Those charges, on 
top of the fact that seven former Mexican police officials have been indicted 
in Los Angeles, have added a significant dimension to a trial that was likely 
from the start to rankle relations between Mexico and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The first 50 witnesses to testify in the case have included a bevy of DEA 
agents, an FBI criminologist, a doctor who examined Camarena's mutilated body 
in a Guadalajara hospital, a Mexican lawyer who was shot and nearly killed 
because he helped the DEA and more than a dozen paid DEA informants, most of 
them Mexican and many of whom have engaged in criminal activity and been given 
immunity for their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the informants gave testimony that was not seriously challenged. Among 
them was Juan Fernandez, who said he helped manage a string of ranches for 
Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero and doled out bribes to officials in 
four Mexican law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the six men and six women on the jury are taking copious notes. 
Keeping track of the hundreds of people involved in the case, virtually all of 
whom have Spanish names, is a herculean task. The problem was underscored by 
the prosecution's distribution to reporters of a five-page glossary containing 
hundreds of names of people who will be mentioned during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many of the witnesses have testified in Spanish, requiring their 
remarks to be translated into English. All of the defendants speak Spanish and 
have interpreters at their sides. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second Los Angeles federal trial of people accused of involvement 
in Camarena's murder. Three men were convicted in 1988 and given long prison 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The current trial may prove to be more significant than the first one because 
two of the defendants are accused of being among those that plotted Camarena's 
kidnaping and murder. None of the defendants in the first case was alleged to 
have had such a pivotal role. 
</P>
<P>
Securing convictions of those two men -- Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, 45, a 
Honduran drug kingpin, and Ruben Zuno Arce, 59, a politically influential 
Mexican businessman who prosecutors contend is the key link between narcotics 
traffickers and the Mexican government -- is very important to the DEA, which 
is continuing to investigate Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
The other two defendants are Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, 31, a former Jalisco 
state policeman who is accused of being one of the bodyguards at the 
Guadalajara house where Camarena was tortured, and Javier Vasquez Velasco, 38, 
also a Mexican citizen. He is accused of killing an American writer and a Cuban 
medical student, who were mistaken for DEA agents and murdered just eight days 
before Camarena was kidnaped. Judge Rafeedie has allowed the government to 
combine the two cases, saying there is significant overlap between them. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena's murder and the ensuing investigation has strained U.S.-Mexican 
relations for five years. Numerous DEA officials have complained that Mexican 
law enforcement was slow to help search for Camarena's killers and, at times, 
impeded the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Mexican officials have complained that their U.S. counterparts 
have not given them sufficient credit for the successful prosecutions of more 
than two dozen people in Mexico on charges stemming from Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government also is unhappy about how the trial has gone so far. 
Mexican law enforcement has been portrayed as corrupt as the Chicago police 
during the height of mobster Al Capone's reign in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, serious accusations have been leveled at several other prominent 
Mexican government officials, including assertions that the attorney general, 
Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, was involved with drug traffickers in the 
mid-1980s while he was governor of Jalisco, the scene of Camarena's murder. He 
and many of the other top officials vaguely linked in testimony to the case 
have not been indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Angel Pescador Osuna, Mexico's Los Angeles consul general, contends that 
leveling such accusations at unindicted officials is "very irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Pescador said he worried that if allegations of this type about uncharged 
Mexican officials continue to surface at the trial, it could harm Mexico's 
relations with the United States. The allegations "generate problems that don't 
seem appropriate at this time," Pescador said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an expression in Spanish, 'un pelo en la sopa,' (a hair in the soup) 
which describes this situation," he said. "We don't want to spoil the soup 
because of this," Pescador stressed. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at his office near historic Olvera Street, he said that while 
there may have been problems involving some Mexican law enforcement officials 
and their ties to drug traffickers in the past, times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in 1990," he said. "We want to be sure the U.S. government and the 
American people know there is a new way of doing things in Mexico."

UCLA has backed away from a controversial plan to move its highly touted 
experimental elementary school off campus and into the Santa Monica public 
school system, university officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was abandoned in the face of intense protests from some parents and 
faculty from the Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary School, who lobbied 
state legislators and officials to oppose the move, generating enough political 
opposition to kill chances that the plan would receive the required state 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our concerns all along has been to guarantee (the school's) integrity 
and independence," said UCLA Assistant Vice Chancellor Carlotta Melon. That 
would have required legislation to allow the school to maintain its 
independence while part of a public school system, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the support from the state, we have no choice" but to drop the plan, 
Melon said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was a major victory for the small group of parents and University 
Elementary School officials who had opposed relocation of the historic 
laboratory school, contending it would not be able to continue to function as 
an independent research facility under the supervision of a public school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crucial to keep the school (at UCLA), not just for our children, but for 
the benefit of kids all over the country" who benefit from research conducted 
at the school, said Kathy Seal, mother of a University Elementary School 
student and one of the leaders of the protest. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and Santa Monica school officials have contended that aligning the school 
with a public school district would better allow it to test the relevance of 
its research outside of the rarefied atmosphere of a college campus. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the school -- which tests new teaching techniques on its 450 
students -- would have been built on parkland in Santa Monica's ethnically 
diverse Ocean Park section. It would have operated under the aegis of the Santa 
Monica-Malibu Unified School District, but be staffed and supervised by UCLA's 
School of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed because we really felt we were doing something both to 
assure (the school) of long-term security and to benefit students in our 
district," said Dan Ross, president of the Santa Monica-Malibu School Board. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had a good chance of getting there, and we've been 
short-circuited by politics rather than a good educational study and analysis" 
of the implications of the move, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty of persuading legislators to support the plan -- coupled with 
the likelihood that parents would sue to block the move -- prompted the 
district to abandon the proposal, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary school has operated on the UCLA campus for more than 100 years, 
drawing students of every ethnic group and income level from across Southern 
California. In its ungraded classrooms, where teachers develop their own 
curricula, children of movie stars, politicians and poor families have served 
as guinea pigs to test innovative teaching theories and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations to move the school began after UCLA announced plans to use a 
record $15-million endowment to build a new Graduate School of Management on 
part of the nine acres used by the school. 
</P>
<P>
Melon said plans to build the new graduate school will go forward, while the 
university considers the future of the prestigious lab school. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary school faculty and parents are proposing the university build a 
facility alongside the school to house the Graduate School of Education and 
coordinate lab school research. That would allow the lab school to share its 
findings with schools around the state. Melon said that is only one of several 
options under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of the proposal comes only a few weeks after UCLA was forced by 
community opposition to retreat from some aspects of its plans for a major 
campus expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The university had to scale back a massive, long-range development plan earlier 
this month after Westwood residents and community leaders complained about the 
increased traffic congestion and air pollution the project would generate.

TOP-LEVEL RAISES FIRST TO GO IN SCHOOL BUDGET CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top administrators of the Los Angeles Unified School District will get no pay 
Raises this year, the Board of Education decided Monday night in beginning a 
series of votes designed to tighten the district's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the board grappled with closing an unprecedented $220-million budget 
shortage, a private consultant told board members that, to keep the nation's 
second-largest school district from going bankrupt, they will have to make even 
more painful cuts soon. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Fuller of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, an accounting firm hired by the 
district, and an advisory committee of business leaders said the district must 
find other areas for cutting and reorganizing within the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Because costs are rising faster than the revenues the district gets from the 
state and other sources, it "faces a severe financial crisis which poses a 
serious threat to its financial solvency," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the steps taken so far by the board as it lurches toward a June 30 
deadline to submit a tentative, balanced spending plan have come from one-time 
savings by juggling funds and from cuts in district administration. 
</P>
<P>
The board Monday evening voted to freeze the pay of 111 top administrators, 
whose salaries range from $75,000 to the $164,555 earned by Supt. Leonard 
Britton. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after several hours of often emotional testimony and sometimes rancorous 
debate, the board began slicing into school services. 
</P>
<P>
Going through thick blue and gray "cut books," the board -- in slashing $44 
million -- cut maintenance and custodial services, took away lottery funds from 
individual schools, and increased the size of classes that include some special 
education students. Board members postponed most of the toughest decisions, 
which would involve another $66 million in cuts, until a special session 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the budget crunch -- the school district's worst since 
California voters passed tax-slashing Proposition 13 in 1978 -- pushed board 
members onto a collision course over allocation of the district's court-ordered 
desegregation funds. 
</P>
<P>
The board will not vote until next week on its proposed $2.6-million 
integration spending plan, but members clashed sharply over what to do about 
adding new schools to the list of those eligible for special funds. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, any school in the rapidly growing And increasingly minority district 
that reached a point at which 70% of its students were Latino, black, Asian or 
other non-Anglo, was considered racially isolated and given extra money. The 
funds, designed to pay for smaller classes, extra counselors and special 
programs, are aimed at alleviating harmful effects of segregation listed by the 
court in a 1981 resolution of a lengthy desegregation case. 
</P>
<P>
This year, it appears there may not be enough money to include 21 newly 
segregated schools. The schools, mainly in the San Fernando Valley, Westside 
and other historically Anglo areas, have passed the 70% minority mark. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Rita Walters, who represents South-Central Los Angeles, said it 
would be wrong to give schools in more affluent areas the desegregation funds 
if it means taking money away from those who have suffered the most and 
longest. 
</P>
<P>
But other board members, arguing that bused-in minorities have as much right to 
the special funds as those who stay in their neighborhood schools, said they 
want the entire integration spending program re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
Peter James, the board's attorney for integration programs, said the court 
would probably look askance at any arbitrary effort to change the funding 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the board began condemnation procedures on a 17-acre chunk of 
the former Ambassador Hotel site in the crowded Wilshire District. Developer 
Donald Trump heads an investment group that wants to build high-rise offices 
there and has vowed to stop the district from using the site for a high school.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLED BY CAR HE ATTEMPTED TO SLOW DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was struck and killed Monday when he left a party at a Chatsworth house 
and walked into the street to try to slow down a car that was repeatedly 
speeding by the home, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Chatsworth man, whose name was not released pending 
notification of his family, was killed about 3:30 a.m. when he was struck by 
the car, which then sped away, police said. Officers said they were 
investigating whether the incident was motivated by a dispute at the party that 
resulted in one party-goer's ejection. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if this is a murder or a vehicular manslaughter," Detective Don 
Bellante said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE SAYS CITIES CAN'T BAN MALATHION 
MISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Yaffe issued a court order Monday 
stopping the cities of Azusa, Lynwood and Pasadena from enforcing ordinances 
designed to stop aerial malathion spraying by banning low-altitude formation 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
Yaffe granted a request from the state for a preliminary injunction, saying 
that local ordinances cannot restrict the state during emergency eradication 
programs, such as the one developed for the 11-month-old Medfly infestation in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinances led to a series of polite aerial confrontations earlier this 
year between local police helicopters and the state's squadron of helicopters, 
which need to fly low and in formation to conduct malathion spraying. Pasadena 
police issued two citations against the state's pilots for violating a city 
ordinance. The cases are pending.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DAY-CARE CENTER WOULD COMBINE ELDERLY, 
YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine a day-care center where children and the elderly mix -- sharing meals, 
recreation and activities. At least twice a day, the two groups would break 
from their senior citizen or preschool activities and mingle. 
</P>
<P>
Such a proposal was unveiled Monday by Los Angeles Councilwoman Joy Picus, who 
said at a news conference that she is helping seek funding for a privately 
operated "inter-generational day care center" in the west San Fernando Valley. 
"It will be the first of its kind in Los Angeles and it will carve new roads in 
the care of seniors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If funding comes as expected from charitable organizations, state and federal 
sources and other donors, the center could open by the end of next year, Picus 
said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY REQUESTS STAY OF REDISTRICTING 
RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Los Angeles County on Monday petitioned the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals to stay a federal judge's order requiring the Board of 
Supervisors to redraw district lines. They also asked the court to consider 
immediately an appeal of the historic ruling that the boundaries discriminate 
against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
However, county lawyers have acknowledged that there is little chance the 
appeals court will grant their request. If the petition is denied, the county 
will appeal again when U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's final order is 
signed, possibly in July, county attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Kenyon refused to stay his order and allow the county to immediately 
appeal the case, saying it is "more appropriate for the county to simply let 
this court finish its duties." 
</P>
<P>
The judge earlier this month ruled that supervisors in 1981 drafted a 
redistricting plan that diluted the voting strength of the county's 3 million 
Latinos.

EFFORT TO LIMIT CITY OFFICIALS TO TWO TERMS ABANDONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of a ballot initiative that would impose a two-term limit on Los 
Angeles city officials said Monday that they have abandoned their effort to 
qualify the measure for the November election, but vowed to try again. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the grass-roots coalition of community groups, who had 
planned to deliver thousands of petitions to the city clerk today, said they 
were far short of the 205,000 signatures needed to qualify the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a very good amount of signatures, but not enough," said spokeswoman 
Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the failed campaign will serve as a foundation for a second 
effort, which could begin as early as next month to qualify for the ballot in 
April, 1991. Supporters said, however, that they will go forward only if they 
raise enough money to hire professional signature-gatherers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have discovered that the cynics were right," said Harald Hahn, the group's 
treasurer. "You can't do it on volunteers alone. It is one of the problems of 
volunteer services. Everyone promises you support, but when you need them, they 
may or may not be there." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, called L.A. 2-Term Limit, raised about $35,000, but Lake said it 
needed about 10 times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed charter amendment, elected city officials, who now have no 
limits on their terms, would have been able to serve two four-year terms in a 
row, but would have been required to sit out at least one term before running 
again for the same office. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, City Atty. James K. Hahn, Controller Rick Tuttle and 12 of 
the 15 City Council members would have been blocked from running for reelection 
if the measure were approved by voters. Only Council members Richard Alatorre, 
Ruth Galanter and Nate Holden, who are serving their first full terms, would 
have been able to run again without waiting a term. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the initiative would not disclose how many signatures they 
gathered since launching the campaign in December. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the articles to say why we lost, not what we lost by," said Bob 
Carcia, who coordinated volunteers.

SCHOOL BOARD MOVES TO TAKE AMBASSADOR HOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: REPRESENTATIVES OF DONALD TRUMP, OWNER OF THE SITE, SAY THEY'LL GO 
TO COURT TO BLOCK BUILDING OF A HIGH SCHOOL ON THE MID-WILSHIRE PARCEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District trustees voted Monday to begin condemnation 
proceedings to take over the Ambassador Hotel, despite a prediction by a 
representative of Donald Trump that the developer will win a suit to prevent 
the district from building a high school on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Res, executive vice president for Trump Wilshire Associates, told the 
board the $73 million that the district is offering for 17 acres of the 23-acre 
site is far below the up to $200 million the developer believes the property is 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
She accused the board of "fiscal irresponsibility" for choosing to build a 
school on "some of the world's most expensive property," and predicted that the 
Trump organization will prove in court that the environmental impact report for 
the project is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The district, Res said, "will be embroiled for years in litigation it cannot 
win." 
</P>
<P>
She also accused the board of "sabotaging" efforts to revitalize the 
Mid-Wilshire area by building a school that would drive away businesses. She 
predicted "no school will ever be built on the Ambassador site." 
</P>
<P>
But School Board President Jackie Goldberg accused Trump of putting his 
interests ahead of the welfare of the 3,000 children in the area who spend up 
to three hours a day on buses because there is no classroom space for them in 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Another school board member, Roberta Weintraub, wondered why Trump was so 
opposed to selling the property when he could use the money to pay off his 
growing debts. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell him to settle his problems in New York," Weintraub said to Res and Trump 
attorney, Kevin Brogan. "Stay there and let us get on with the show." 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the board approved a resolution certifying its intent to 
condemn the land under its eminent domain power and seek the money to pay for 
the property. The district can take over the property, but only if it proves in 
court that it paid the fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Mason, an attorney for the district, said it will not seek to condemn 
the property until the board has the financing. The State Allocation Board last 
month approved $50 million for the project, and district officials say they 
will attempt to borrow the rest of the money. 
</P>
<P>
The condemnation vote was previously postponed to allow Trump Wilshire 
attorneys to provide information on how they reached their conclusion that the 
property is worth the $150 million to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg asked Brogan if he had the information, but the Trump attorney 
replied: "We'll do our talking at 111 N. Hill St.," referring to the address of 
the County Courthouse where the battle will now move. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, district officials have searched for a site for a high 
school to serve the students now being bused to other neighborhoods at a cost 
of nearly $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Trump organization, which wants to build a 125-story complex on the 
Ambassador site, has refused the district's offer for the property. 
</P>
<P>
The 69-year hotel, which closed a year and half ago, was home to the famous 
Cocoanut Grove night club and, in its heyday, served as an elegant backdrop for 
Hollywood celebrities, movie moguls, royalty and U.S. presidents.

BROKER IS SENTENCED IN MONEY LAUNDERING; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: A JUDGE GIVES THE MOORPARK MAN 6 MONTHS FOR HIS ROLE IN AN ALLEGED 
SCHEME INVOLVING SAN DIEGO FINANCIER RICHARD T. SILBERMAN.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County investment broker was sentenced Monday to six months in 
federal prison for his role in an alleged money-laundering scheme that 
prosecutors contend was directed by San Diego financier Richard T. Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Ziegler, who was ordered to surrender July 26 to federal authorities, had 
pleaded guilty two months ago to a single felony count. Originally accused of 
executing the complex financial transactions involved in the case against 
Silberman, Ziegler pleaded guilty to violating a federal currency law. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was handed down in San Diego by U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence 
Irving, who agreed to prosecutors' request for leniency. He imposed the 
sentence the day before a jury was to begin deliberations in Silberman's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler, 45, of Moorpark, declined Monday to comment on the sentence or on the 
case. He did not testify at Silberman's trial. According to federal 
authorities, Ziegler was recruited in the alleged plot by a Los Angeles 
financier who was acting on Silberman's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., is awaiting the jury's verdict on seven felony counts. He is accused of 
laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent allegedly characterized as 
Colombian cocaine profits. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Silberman faces up to 75 years in prison. His trial lasted for 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler was originally indicted on five felony charges in the case, counts that 
could have meant up to 35 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
But in a written plea agreement filed April 10, Ziegler pleaded guilty to the 
single count, admitting that he structured a transfer of funds to avoid filing 
the paper work that federal law demands for any transaction involving $10,000 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
He said he took $45,000, broke it into various sums under $10,000 for deposit 
to a San Fernando Valley thrift account and wired it to Hong Kong, to a bank 
account that prosecutors contend was controlled by Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
The $45,000, part of the first $100,000 delivered by the undercover FBI agent 
in the case, later made its way to a Swiss bank account, along with most of the 
rest of the $100,000, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Under complicated new federal sentencing rules, Ziegler's guilty plea to the 
single count meant that Irving should have sentenced him to eight to 14 months 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the 
case, said Monday that the government sought a sentence of only six months 
based on Ziegler's cooperation with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder did not elaborate on the extent or duration of Ziegler's cooperation. 
Immediately after Gorder's reference Monday in court, Irving ordered sealed a 
June 13 letter to prosecutors from Ziegler's defense attorney, San Diego lawyer 
John A. Mitchell, that apparently discussed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Irving did not elaborate, either, in imposing the six-month sentence. The judge 
ordered Ziegler to spend the first three months of the term in prison but said 
Ziegler was to spend the next three months in a halfway house.

Prosecutors had asked Irving to impose a $20,000 fine as well, the maximum

CSU OFFICIALLY RETREATS FROM TAYLOR RANCH; 
</P>
<P>
NEGOTIATIONS: AN INFLUENTIAL UNIVERSITY PANEL RECOMMENDS REOPENING THE SEARCH 
FOR A SUITABLE LOCATION FOR A NEW CAMPUS. APPROVAL WOULD DELAY CONSTRUCTION OF 
A FACILITY BY YEARS.

Citing the likelihood of a lengthy court battle, California State University 
officially retreated Monday from what was once an all-or-nothing ultimatum that 
the controversial Taylor Ranch site west of Ventura is the only acceptable 
location in the county for a new university campus. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis E. McCune, acting chancellor of the university system, said the key 
factor in the university's retreat from its once-tough insistence on the Taylor 
Ranch site was the threat of a years-long court battle by the owners of the 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of unified community support, division within the Ventura City Council 
over the Taylor Ranch site and the anticipated cost of freeway access to the 
hillside site were other factors in a decision to completely reopen the site 
selection process, McCune said. 
</P>
<P>
The university's quiet retreat from its earlier position came just one month 
after Cal State Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, who had issued the Taylor Ranch 
ultimatum last December, was forced from office, but university officials said 
the policy change had nothing to do with her ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision by the owners that they would not sell their property without a 
full condemnation procedure, coupled with all the other factors, makes this a 
very difficult project," McCune said. "It's problematical whether we could ever 
proceed." 
</P>
<P>
The decision Monday to reopen site selection -- a process expected to delay 
construction of any new campus in the county by years -- was made during a 
meeting at the office of the chancellor in Long Beach by an ad-hoc committee of 
trustees charged with finding a campus location. 
</P>
<P>
The full board is expected to approve the recommendation when it meets next 
month, said university Vice Chancellor John M. Smart. The mechanics of 
literally starting over again will be determined by an advisory committee -- 
made up of representatives from cities and county staffs as well as advocates 
and opponents of the Taylor Ranch site -- that will meet in Ventura on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the committee will decide how to evaluate sites, Smart said. He 
said the university will examine sites already proposed as well as new 
locations never before considered. The committee will then narrow the choices 
down and present its recommendations to a consultant who will perform the 
necessary environmental impact studies. 
</P>
<P>
While university officials say the ultimate site for a new campus is now wide 
open, a parcel of farmland at Rice Avenue and the Ventura Freeway in Oxnard is 
one location that is being discussed as a possible option. Another location at 
Rose and Central avenues west of Camarillo has also been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Some Taylor Ranch supporters, including Ventura City Councilman James Monahan, 
took Monday's dramatic shift by Cal State as a sign that the university may 
never build a campus in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the beginning of the end," Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
But university officials stressed on Monday that their commitment to Ventura 
County is strong. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the need is there," Trustee Marian Bagdasarian said. 
</P>
<P>
The university chose the 465-acre hillside Taylor Ranch west of Ventura as its 
preferred location in 1987, after negotiations fell apart for its first choice, 
land owned by the Lusk Co. near Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Ranch heiress Cynthia Wood, her mother and stepfather had previously 
agreed to what Cal State officials called a friendly condemnation, in which 
they agreed to sell their property under the threat that the state would 
condemn it. 
</P>
<P>
That would have allowed the property owners a tax advantage while avoiding the 
need for lengthy court action to take the property against the owners' wishes. 
</P>
<P>
But on May 22, the owners cut off negotiations with the university, officials 
said. Through their attorney, James Hurley, the owners insisted that they would 
fight the state in court to keep their property. 
</P>
<P>
Hurley did not return calls on Monday to explain the owners' change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is more disappointed than we are with this," said Smart, a Santa 
Barbara native who was raised in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Taylor Ranch site will still be included in the environmental 
impact study, it will no longer be the focus of the report, officials said. 
Officials said they will consider sites with a minimum of 200 acres, with good 
freeway access, single ownership and little or no community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the site selection process will make it impossible to meet a 
four-year target date to open a two-year off-campus center, the first phase of 
a campus that would grow over 30 years into a four-year university serving up 
to 15,000 students, Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
He could not project a new date for a university in Ventura County, saying only 
he hopes that it will be "before the turn of the century." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to pull back from the Taylor Ranch site has already had immediate 
effects on the center here, known as the Ventura campus of Cal State 
Northridge, said Smart and campus Director Joyce M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our enrollment curve has already been adjusted," Kennedy said. "We had been 
approved to grow from 125 to 150 full-time equivalent students. That has been 
cut back to 80." 
</P>
<P>
That campus, now located in rented space near Seaward Avenue and the Ventura 
Freeway in Ventura, is bursting at the seams with no more room to grow and a 
long student waiting list, Kennedy said. Monday's decision, the culmination of 
events occurring over the past three months, means that the campus will have to 
survive longer in leased facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Baggerly, executive director of the Environmental Coalition and an 
outspoken opponent of the Taylor Ranch, said Monday that the county can become 
unified in a search for an appropriate university site. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had continued with the Taylor Ranch, it would have killed all the 
opportunity for a university in Ventura County," Baggerly said of university 
officials. "Now, the opportunities are very bright for finding a site." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State performed its first environmental impact report on Taylor Ranch in 
1987, projecting a two-year campus with about 2,000 students. Baggerly and the 
Environmental Coalition filed a lawsuit challenging that study, contending that 
the ultimate size of the campus should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
In a major turning point in the fight against the Taylor Ranch site, Superior 
Court Judge Joe Hadden ruled against the state last November, saying it had to 
prepare a second environmental impact report based on the ultimate 
establishment of a four-year campus. 
</P>
<P>
As opposition mounted from environmentalists fearing additional air pollution 
from students' cars and traffic in downtown Ventura, then-Chancellor Reynolds 
told the county that she was not sure whether the state would go through with a 
second expensive environmental impact report if there was not the necessary 
community support. 
</P>
<P>
In December, she told Ventura County that the state would no longer consider 
alternative sites. It was Taylor Ranch or nothing, she said. Supporters in the 
community rallied, and trustees decided to order a second impact report on 
March 1. By law, an environmental impact report must also consider alternate 
sites, but university officials stressed that their focus was the Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds has since left the university system under pressure for reasons 
unrelated to Taylor Ranch. She is technically still on the staff until July 1 
but has been replaced in her duties by McCune. Smart said her departure is 
unrelated to the trustees' reopening of the site selection.

LIMITS ON SEPTIC TANKS MAY CURB CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that could curb housing construction in the Santa Rosa Valley and 
other rural areas of Ventura County, state water-quality officials adopted new 
restrictions on septic tanks Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy adopted by the California Regional Water Quality Board, 
developers who install septic tanks will, in most cases, have to conduct an 
extensive study showing that they will not contaminate ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Septic tanks catch waste materials from household drains and toilets. Solids 
are trapped in the tanks while liquids are allowed to percolate through the 
earth and into ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Homes now using septic tanks are not affected by the new policy, which was 
adopted after studies blamed septic tanks in part for the presence of nitrates 
and other pollutants in some ground water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to make it a lot tougher for projects with lots of between one and 
five acres to go on septic tanks," said Bruce Smith, of the county planning 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Lots larger than five acres are exempt from the study requirement, and county 
regulations already ban septic tanks on most lots smaller than one acre. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Rosa Valley northeast of Camarillo would be the area most affected, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
About 280 houses on one-acre lots have been proposed for the Caston Trust area, 
Smith said, and applications have been filed or are expected soon for another 
110 houses in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, unrecorded projects cannot proceed until the water study 
is completed, said Nancy Settle, another planning division official. 
</P>
<P>
"The criteria seem pretty tough," Smith said. "Many of these areas may have to 
go on sewers." 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not estimate how much a sewer hookup would add to the cost of 
a house, but said that the sewage plants nearest to the Santa Rosa Valley are 
in Camarillo and Oxnard, so major trunk lines would have to be installed. Such 
a project would be "tremendously growth-inducing" and controversial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The study requirement does not affect individual lot owners who want to build a 
single house, Settle said. 
</P>
<P>
In such cases, she said, septic tanks will be allowed on lots as small as 
20,000 square feet -- a little less than half an acre. 
</P>
<P>
"What the board is trying to address is subdivisions," Settle said. 
</P>
<P>
The new interim policy will apply until the water quality board concludes work 
on a permanent policy, probably in about a year, said Anne Saffell, chief of 
the water board's planning unit. 
</P>
<P>
The policy adopted Monday is less restrictive than one proposed by the board's 
staff in April. 
</P>
<P>
That plan would have required a minimum of two acres for a septic tank and 
would have required developers who use septic tanks to install sewer lines in 
areas deemed likely to need a sewage treatment system eventually. 
</P>
<P>
The policy adopted Monday strongly recommends that developers install sewer 
lines for eventual hookup but does not require them.

DRUG ABUSE CENTER OPENS BRANCH OFFICE

<TEXT>
<P>
Palmer Drug and Alcohol Abuse Program will open its first satellite center in 
the county Friday in Fillmore with $7,500 of the city's Community Development 
Block Grant funds. The nonprofit organization has counseled substance abusers 
and their families in the county from a base in Camarillo since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Director Sergio Castellanos said the Fillmore center at 565 Sespe St. 
evolved from a counseling program begun at Fillmore High School 2 1/2 years 
ago. "We recognize there is a strong need in the area that has gone unmet for a 
long time, both for youths and their families," Castellanos said Monday. "With 
our bilingual staff, we can meet that need." 
</P>
<P>
Castellanos said that the program has received strong community support and 
that he hopes to coordinate efforts with other youth programs in Fillmore, such 
as the new Boys and Girls Club. The satellite center will function initially as 
a drop-in facility where young people can stop to talk, play Ping-Pong or 
listen to music. 
</P>
<P>
Counselor Ed Ramirez, who has been working with local high school students, 
will be in charge of the program. Initially, center hours will be from noon to 
7 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Counseling groups and social activities 
are expected to build as word of the center spreads. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the Fillmore kids have alcohol problems," Castellanos said. While 
marijuana and crack cocaine are present in the community, he estimated that 
alcohol is a bigger issue for many Fillmore teens. "We're also seeing an 
increase in psychedelics like LSD." 
</P>
<P>
Castellanos said parental involvement is a key part of the program and promised 
complete confidentiality for all participants. JANET BERGAMO

A 17-year-old Santee boy was arrested Monday after he stole a school bus and 
led police on a chase through Clairemont and La Jolla, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1:25 a.m., officers saw a San Diego school bus speeding near Mt. Alifan 
Drive and Balboa Avenue in Clairemont, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers signaled for the driver to stop, Robinson said, and when he did 
not, they gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
Police followed the bus until it crashed into a building at Pearl Street and 
Girard Avenue in La Jolla, Robinson said. The driver, whose name was not 
released because of his age, was not injured.

WATER HOOKUP BAN MAY BLOCK PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ojai Redevelopment Agency may not be able to build an affordable housing 
project because of a moratorium on new water hookups in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai City Manager Andrew Belknap said that funding a proposed 21-condominium 
project on North Montgomery Street may be problematic because of the 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is tentatively planning to give $250,000 in housing reserve funds to 
the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., which is building the project. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap has proposed that $20,000 be earmarked to study other methods the 
agency could use to meet its state mandate to provide affordable housing, such 
as funding home improvement loans and loan programs geared for first-time 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose last week when the City Council, acting as the Redevelopment 
Agency, reviewed the agency's preliminary budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The draft budget projects that the agency will have a total of $2.27 million 
available next year with $404,093 set aside for low- and moderate-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap said more funds will also be available for downtown improvements. "The 
agency will continue to be the most entrepreneurial area of the city 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed expenses include $300,000 to buy or improve property for vehicle 
parking, $125,000 to expand a 20-space park-and-ride lot by 60 vehicle spaces, 
$25,000 to study parking needs, $32,000 to upgrade the Arcade Plaza and $43,000 
to bring the Ojai Valley Chamber of Commerce building up to earthquake safety 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from property tax assessments in the redevelopment area is projected to 
reach $450,000 next year, Belknap said, or about $4,000 more than this year and 
$45,000 up from 1988-89 tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The agency should end this fiscal year with a total reserve of $1.67 million. 
The Redevelopment Agency will consider adopting the budget June 26. THIA BELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS JAIL TERM IN DEFENSE FRAUD SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former employee of a defense subcontractor was sentenced Monday to 20 
weekends in jail for his role in a scheme to produce 9 million untested bolts 
for military aircraft, including the B-1 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Whitham, a former shop floor manager for McHaffie Inc. of Sylmar, 
also was ordered by U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima to perform 150 hours of 
community service and serve three years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
Whitham, 37, had pleaded guilty to two counts of making false statements to the 
Defense Department as part of an eight-year scheme to cut costs by producing 
bolts that were not tested. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the longest-running fraud on a defense contract ever uncovered," said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen Mansfield. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for July 2 for the company's president, Norman McHaffie, and 
former quality control supervisor James Hicks.

PANEL ASSAILS BOLD COLORS OF RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restaurant owners Marty Gay and Michelle Sandoval, who successfully turned a 
Ventura sandwich shop into the fancy restaurant Voila, are being criticized for 
their newest restaurant's colorful paint job by advocates of muted colors in 
downtown Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Redevelopment Commission was so appalled at the restaurant's burnt 
orange, green and purple paint job that it has asked the city's Redevelopment 
Agency to consider banning certain colors from downtown buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has yet to take up the request. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the colors came up last week when the Redevelopment Commission 
reviewed the restaurant's sign permit. "The sign is great, but the building has 
got to go," Commissioner William Hattabaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment area has color guidelines for signs, awnings and building 
trim that complement the tan and red-tile theme of the Ojai Arcade, an arched 
walkway in the heart of downtown. But the area has no restrictions on building 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
Gay and Sandoval, both Ojai residents, recently transformed the old Backstage 
cafe into MK's, an eatery with a "Mexican Moorish"-style interior. The same 
bold color scheme extends through the restaurant's rear entrance onto its 
stucco walls that are visible from Signal Street. 
</P>
<P>
Gay said he has had "a lot of positive response" to the bold scheme from his 
customers. "We like the colors, and we didn't think they were offensive," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At its meeting last week, the commission also found that one of the 
restaurant's proposed signs did not meet the rule that all signs be made of 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
Gay said he will redo the sign, but the buildings' colors will remain the same 
until the city orders them changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to change Ojai," he said. "We're just trying to show a style 
that's authentic to Old California." THIA BELL

WATER FIRM FUNDS CONTROVERSIAL VIDEO

<P>
One of the county's three largest water companies has given its reluctant 
support to a video on water conservation that promotes the need to import state 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas Municipal Water District directors agreed last week to contribute $500 
to a 22-minute video produced by the Ventura Economic Development Assn. on 
condition that Casitas not be listed as a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Several board members said they were concerned about how it would appear to the 
public for Casitas to support a video that indicates importing water from the 
California Aqueduct is the best solution to the county's water crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Importing water from the state aqueduct is expensive, and some no-growth 
activists argue that tapping into water from Northern California will open the 
area to unchecked growth. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas General Manager John Johnson said some board members were concerned 
that the video could be viewed as having a pro-growth slant. 
</P>
<P>
"The video was very professionally produced, and it provided good information 
concerning water needs in Ventura County," Johnson said. "There was some 
concern expressed about some of the suggestions in the video and its 
participants." 
</P>
<P>
The association is a consortium of county businesses that support growth in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, the directors said, is that Casitas was asked to contribute 
toward the $10,000 cost of the video after it was made. 
</P>
<P>
"In the future, it should be clear that we will not support something if asked 
after the fact," said board President James W. Coultas. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Bennett, an association member who produced the "Water Awareness Video," 
asked for the $500 contribution last month when he showed the finished tape to 
the water board. He said the production has the support of many other water 
agencies, businesses and individuals in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said Friday he disagrees with the board members' conclusions. "It says 
specifically in the video that it doesn't have a pro-growth slant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end, I make an appeal for state water to be brought in and say it will 
not affect growth," he said. "We say growth is not tied to water, that it is up 
to the political bodies." THIA BELL

10 SOVIET YOUTHS GET WORKING VACATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten young Soviets will arrive July 1 to help the California Conservation Corps 
in Camarillo to build a trail across the Santa Monica Mountains and to restore 
an old Santa Barbara fort, the state youth organization has announced. 
</P>
<P>
During their monthlong stay, the Soviet youths hope to make the rounds of 
Southern California tourist spots, such as Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Because they will arrive with little money, the corps is seeking donations, 
said Terri Kirby, the Camarillo operations officer. 
</P>
<P>
The California Conservation Corps was established in 1976 to provide young 
people 18 to 23 with job experience in return for work on public projects, 
often outdoor physical labor. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo camp competed with its 16 sister camps to host the Soviets, Kirby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet youths primarily will help California crews work on the Backbone 
Trail over the Santa Monica Mountains and the restoration of the Santa Barbara 
Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the Soviet youths' California visit, 30 young people from other 
corps camps will fly to the Soviet Union in August, Kirby said. They are 
scheduled to spend a month near Moscow working on historic restorations and 
parks projects. 
</P>
<P>
None of the corps members from Camarillo are scheduled for the Moscow trip, 
Kirby said. But Paul Magie, assistant director of the Camarillo corps, will 
accompany the group as a staff member. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in offering donations may call 484-4345. JOANNA MILLER

BEACH RESTROOMS TO CLOSE TO SAVE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A majority of the restrooms and some showers at San Buenaventura State Beach 
will be closed weekdays under a plan to conserve water during Ventura's drought 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials hope to save up to 4,000 gallons of water a day by closing the 
facilities, a step they say is necessary to meet Ventura's mandatory 20% 
reduction in water use. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this week, three of the five restrooms at the popular state beach 
will be closed during off-peak hours, said Walt Deleu, chief maintenance 
supervisor for the Channel Coast District. Four of the beach's eight outdoor 
cold showers will also be turned off to conserve water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical toilets will be installed outside the closed facilities and signs will 
be posted nearby directing beach-goers to the nearest open restrooms and 
showers, Deleu said. 
</P>
<P>
The bathrooms and showers will be reopened on weekends and on days when there 
are many visitors to the beach, Deleu said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be very flexible with this," Deleu said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar restrictions are being considered for Emma Wood State Beach, where a 
15% reduction in water use has been achieved by limiting landscape watering, 
Deleu said. 
</P>
<P>
The full contingent of bathroom and hot-shower facilities will remain open at 
Carpinteria and McGrath state beaches, where the installation of a pay shower 
system has led to a 20% reduction in water use. CAROLYN KUSKY

SANTA CLARITA ASKS RESIDENTS TO HELP DEFEAT LANDFILL PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
ELSMERE CANYON: A NEWSPAPER AD URGES RESIDENTS TO LOBBY STATE LEGISLATORS 
AGAINST THE DUMP, WHICH WOULD BE A MILE OUTSIDE THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, which had once cautiously refrained from 
publicly opposing the proposed Elsmere Canyon landfill, has embarked on a 
high-profile campaign to rally residents against the dump, which would be 
located a mile outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita launched the campaign Sunday with a full-page newspaper 
advertisement urging residents to lobby state legislators to support Senate 
Bill 2139 by state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), which would make it more 
difficult for the city and county of Los Angeles to build a dump in Elsmere 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The ad featured a letter, signed by Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, that was sent to more 
than 500 civic groups, clubs and homeowner associations. 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition is formidable and is led by a group of powerful landfill 
proponents including the Elsmere Canyon Corp. (BKK Corp.), City and County of 
Los Angeles and the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
This powerful block of pro-dump interests, the letter said, has repeatedly 
ignored the concerns of Santa Clarita residents, who say the landfill could 
pollute air and ground water and generally destroy the quality of life in the 
Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Without SB 2139," the ad said, "the special interests led by the City Council 
of Los Angeles and County Board of Supervisors will continue to move 
aggressively to develop the Elsmere landfill. The Citizens of Santa Clarita 
must unite to stop this landfill." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council and County Board of Supervisors have approved an 
agreement that would allow the two governments to operate a dump in Elsmere 
Canyon, pending an environmental review of the project. The dump would be in 
unincorporated territory a mile east of the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has put Darcy, an aide to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, at odds with 
her boss, who supports the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The Davis bill would give the state's Integrated Waste Management Board the 
authority to prohibit the city and county of Los Angeles from opening a dump in 
Elsmere Canyon if the two governments fail to comply with a new state law that 
requires every county to create by 1992 a comprehensive plan to dispose of and 
recycle garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also ensure state review of plans for the Elsmere Canyon 
landfill, according to Hunt Braly, a Davis aide. The city and county of Los 
Angeles are "full bore against" the bill and have begun lobbying against it, 
Braly said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the bill was passed by the Senate on May 24 on a 21-13 vote, the 
minimum amount needed to pass. The bill is in the Assembly Committee on Natural 
Resources, and Santa Clarita's lobbying effort is geared toward influencing the 
13 members of the committee. "If everyone would write letters, we would make 
quite an impression," Darcy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly committee has scheduled a hearing on the bill June 25. The ad 
includes a Capitol address and telephone numbers of all committee members. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita council had refused to oppose the dump for more than a year, 
saying it did not want to jeopardize its legal standing to fight the dump in 
court by criticizing the project before the environmental impact report was 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
The council even rebuffed the pleas of the Elsmere Canyon Preservation 
Committee, a citizens group that last fall collected more than 1,600 signatures 
on petitions urging the council to drop its neutral stance and fight the dump. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Board of Supervisors and the Los Angeles City Council tentatively 
approved the dump agreement in the winter, the Santa Clarita City Council voted 
Feb. 13 to oppose the plan. The city-county agreement was made before the 
environmental impact report was completed, thus giving Santa Clarita grounds to 
fight the dump immediately, Darcy said.

PICUS PROPOSES DAY-CARE CENTER FOR YOUNG, ELDERLY; 
</P>
<P>
INTERGENERATIONAL CARE: THE COUNCILWOMAN'S PLAN CALLS FOR THE TWO GROUPS TO 
MEET FOR MEALS, RECREATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Children and the elderly would mingle, enriching each others' lives by sharing 
experiences and perspectives, at an "intergenerational day-care center" in the 
west San Fernando Valley that would be part of a package of care measures for 
senior citizens proposed Monday by Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as child care was the important issue of the 1980s, elder care is going 
to be the important issue of the '90s," Picus told a news conference, noting 
the growing number of elderly Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of Picus' program, the intergenerational center, would not be a 
city institution, but would be run in cooperation with the Valley Senior 
Service and Resource Center, a private group in Reseda, Picus said. It is 
expected to begin operation by the end of next year, with funding expected to 
come from charitable organizations, state and federal funds, and fund-raising 
efforts, Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the first of its kind in Los Angeles and it will carve new roads in 
the care of seniors," Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the center will lie in the interaction between children, who will 
come from lower-income families, and the elderly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The center is still in the planning stages, but Picus aide Jackie Brainard said 
the program would most likely be run by a partnership between a nonprofit 
organization expert in caring for elderly adults and another experienced in 
working with preschool children. 
</P>
<P>
The center would function on two levels. Elderly enrolled in the center would 
participate in activities similar to those at other senior citizen centers, and 
children would have a typical preschool program. But two or three times during 
the day, the two groups would come together to share meals, recreation and 
other organized activities. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what's supposed to really enrich the lives of both," Picus said. 
"Children who are on the site will essentially have grandparents helping them 
enjoy life during the day, and the seniors will get renewed vigor and enjoyment 
in life as they are around the young children." 
</P>
<P>
In another measure aimed at senior citizen care, Picus said she will introduce 
an ordinance in the City Council today that would allow for licensed in-home 
day care for the elderly, patterned after home day-care centers for children. 
Such centers would increase the quantity and quality of elder-care facilities 
and provide families with an alternative for elderly members who are too 
healthy for a nursing home but too ill to be left alone during the day, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ordinance would allow city employees to donate vacation or 
personal-leave days for use by co-workers who need to care for an ailing family 
member and would set up a hot line providing elder-care information. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard said there are about half a dozen intergenerational care centers in 
the United States. The West Valley center will be modeled after a similar 
center run by the Stride Rite shoe company, which was opened earlier this year 
for employees at its corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Stride Rite center is a rare move by business, she said. Picus and 
other elder-care advocates maintain that businesses lose $15 billion a year 
because of a failure to address the need for elder care in their policies and 
employee benefits packages. 
</P>
<P>
Workers must take time off -- often unpaid -- to care for relatives, and the 
stress and emotional drain of caring for ailing relatives decreases worker 
productivity, Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
The burden of care falls most often on women workers, she said. "Many very 
capable, experienced women are forced to leave the work force in order to care 
for their relatives, so that we lose dependable well-trained people," Picus 
said. "Providing for our aging relatives is vitally important to the work force 
today."

STORES MAY DEMAND PRINTS ON CHECKS

<P>
A quickly scrawled signature and flash of a driver's license may no longer be 
enough to cash a check in Oxnard. Beginning in August, some Oxnard 
check-cashing outlets and retail stores will begin demanding thumbprints on the 
front of checks. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud/forgery unit of the Oxnard Police Department hopes that the city's 
most vulnerable merchants will sign up with Operation Chek-Print, a new program 
to prevent forged, stolen and counterfeit checks. 
</P>
<P>
Using new stain-free ink pads, police are targeting check-cashing companies, 
small liquor stores and family-owned markets -- those most susceptible to 
fraudulent checks, said Detective Peter Nicolle of the fraud/forgery unit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's generally at the retail level that we're aiming this," Nicolle said. 
"Crooks will get out of the business of being forgers in Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard is the latest city to begin using a new technology to capture 
thumbprints without offending customers with stained thumbs and discolored 
clothing. The chemical dye used in the special ink pads reacts only with paper, 
leaving no trace on human skin. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not making a mess," said Steve Gordon, vice president of Signature 
Security of Omaha, which began making the dye about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police said they will be able to match suspect thumbprints with those 
gathered by CAL-ID, a statewide computer program that holds the prints of most 
adults arrested since 1970. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

<P>
A former Camarillo bank official has been sentenced to 10 months in federal 
prison and three years probation for embezzlement, FBI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Court Judge Ronald W. Lew also ordered Pamela Sue Nunez, 30, of 
Camarillo to make restitution of $7,931.19 to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nunez had paid back $60,000 of her own volition. 
</P>
<P>
Nunez pleaded guilty to two counts of making unauthorized computerized 
withdrawals from customer accounts and taking the funds for her own use over a 
3 1/2-month period in 1988, FBI Special Agent Gary Auer said. The remaining 
four counts against her were dropped, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunez was an assistant branch manager at Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn., 1656 
Arneill Road, when the embezzlement took place. CAROLYN KUSKY

COUPLE PLEAD NO CONTEST IN INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former secretary in a State Farm Insurance office pleaded no contest Monday 
to charges that she stole more than $250,000 from the company through bogus 
accident-claim settlements, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Rhonda Simpson pleaded to five counts of grand theft and four counts of 
insurance fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Robert Simpson, 39, pleaded no contest to four counts of receiving 
stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan accepted the pleas and scheduled 
sentencing July 9. Under terms of a plea agreement, Rhonda Simpson will receive 
a five-year prison term and her husband a one-year jail term. They must also 
pay restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Rhonda Simpson, who worked for a State Farm agent in Canoga Park, was accused 
of submitting 165 phony claims during 1986-88 and receiving $251,244 that went 
into a joint account with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen S. Licker said Rhonda Simpson would use repair and 
billing documentation from old claim files to produce a new claim, then forge 
the agent's signature and make the draft payable to her husband. She also 
altered copies of the draft sent to State Farm to conceal the pattern of 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud was uncovered by a company claim confirmation program in which a 
small, random sampling of claimants are sent follow-up letters to confirm the 
facts and payment amounts, Licker said. When one claimant denied making the 
claim, an internal audit was launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Simpsons were in Colorado when charges were filed and were extradited to 
Los Angeles to face charges.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLL IN FAVOR OF COURT SITE IS CALLED FLAWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson issued a news release Monday disputing the validity of a 
poll conducted for county officials that said 72% of west San Fernando Valley 
residents questioned favored a proposed courthouse in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said that the poll was "dead wrong" and that the area's residents do 
not want the proposed $37-million judicial complex at Winnetka Avenue and 
Plummer Street, which would have 18 courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"You just cannot build an 18-courtroom structure next to a residential area," 
said Bernson, who represents the Chatsworth and Northridge areas. Other sites 
in the West Valley would be more suitable, including one at Pierce College, 
Bernson said. Pierce College, which is not in his district, was the only 
alternative site Bernson identified in his news release. 
</P>
<P>
The county spent $9,000 to poll about 400 West Valley residents about the 
proposal and found strong support for it, Deputy Court Administrator Robert 
Quist said last week. 
</P>
<P>
However, I.A. (Bud) Lewis, who conducts the Los Angeles Times Poll, called the 
county survey unscientific. It was a "classic case of a loaded questionnaire," 
the nationally known pollster said.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFF-DUTY DEPUTY SHOOTS ALLEGED BURGLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty sheriff's deputy visiting friends in Lake View Terrace shot and 
critically wounded a man who broke into the house, threatened a woman 
acquaintance and attacked the deputy, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Robinson, 25, a deputy for two years, told police that he shot Mario 
G. Thompson, 32, several times in the chest Sunday night after Thompson broke 
into the house in the 10300 block of Foothill Boulevard, Detective Gary 
Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Thompson and one of the four women residents of the house were 
acquainted but refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
After Thompson entered the house, Robinson identified himself as a sheriff's 
deputy and ordered Thompson to leave, but Thompson instead charged the deputy, 
Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
As the two men fought, Robinson drew his service revolver and fired several 
shots into Thompson's upper torso, police said. Robinson was reported in 
critical condition Monday afternoon at Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Milligan said police would present the information to the district attorney's 
office to decide whether criminal charges should be filed against Thompson or 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the two were taken into custody.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO SLAYING OF BOY, 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gregory Scott Smith pleaded not guilty Monday in Ventura County Superior Court 
to murder, kidnaping and arson charges in the death of an 8-year-old Northridge 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 21, of Canoga Park, is scheduled to stand trial on Oct. 22 in the 
slaying of Paul Bailly, who disappeared March 23 after his mother dropped him 
off at the Darby Avenue Elementary School day-care center in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Paul's body was found on fire several hours later in a field in the Santa 
Susana Knolls area south of Simi Valley. Prosecutors allege that Smith kidnaped 
Paul, gagged him with duct tape and strangled him, then set fire to his body. 
</P>
<P>
Smith worked at the Darby day-care center until supervisors fired him March 6 
for playing roughly with children and sometimes deserting them on the 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said the trial will last about a month 
unless prosecutors decide to seek the death penalty, which could lengthen the 
trial to two or three months. Kossoris said his office will decide by July 16 
whether to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren ordered Smith to remain in Ventura County 
Jail without bond until his trial.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHP SEEKS DRIVER WHO CAUSED FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Highway Patrol investigators Monday were seeking a motorist who 
swerved in front of a 16-year-old driver on the San Diego Freeway after a 
running exchange of insults, causing a crash that killed the teen-ager 
instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Reza Moussavinejad of Agoura Hills, who was not wearing a seat belt, died 
when he was thrown from his car as it overturned in the southbound lanes of the 
freeway near Getty Center Drive about 7:10 p.m. Sunday, a spokesman for the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Moussavinejad was driving in the fast lane when a light-blue Camaro swerved 
across all four lanes of the freeway and cut in front of him. Moussavinejad's 
car overturned when he jammed on the brakes to avoid hitting the Camaro, CHP 
spokesman Andy Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-old passenger in Moussavinejad's car, Ray Kushner, who was wearing a 
seat belt, suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Kushner told officers that the two drivers began yelling threats at each other 
near the Ventura Freeway intersection. The verbal exchange continued for 
several miles through Sepulveda Pass, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were searching for the Camaro's driver, described as a white man 
with curly dark hair, a thick mustache and a deep voice.

SHAMIR IMPATIENT AS U.S. FAILS TO BREAK OFF PLO TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: THE PRIME MINISTER ALSO EMPHASIZES HIS POLICY OF INCREASING THE NUMBER 
OF JEWISH RESIDENTS IN THE OCCUPIED AREAS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed impatience Monday with the reluctance 
of the Bush Administration to break off talks with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization over an abortive guerrilla raid. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir also said it is the policy of his new government to increase the numbers 
of Jewish residents in existing settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
But he suggested that no new settlements would be built in the foreseeable 
future, government radio reported, although the principle of colonizing the 
Israeli-held land remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
"More important now is to take care of the existing settlements, to develop 
them, to advance their population," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has pressed for suspension of the U.S.-PLO talks since they began in 
December, 1988, and his campaign was given new life by the failed attack by a 
PLO faction on the Israeli shoreline May 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration characterized the raid as a terror attack and demanded 
that the PLO not only condemn it but expel its architect, Mohammed Abbas, alias 
Abul Abbas, who is a member of the PLO executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the PLO has stopped short of condemning the raid, by the Palestine 
Liberation Front, and made it clear that Abul Abbas will not be expelled under 
pressure from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir wants the United States to make good on its threat to end the talks. 
Under terms set by the Reagan Administration, contact with the PLO depended on 
the group's abandonment of terror tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sure that no one in the United States would dare to say to us that 
again this time they have doubts," Shamir told a group of high school students 
in the city of Petah Tikva. "What do we see? Week after week passes and they 
are still holding consultations, there in the political offices in the United 
States, about whether indeed the PLO is still a terrorist organization." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's statement is the latest round of critical exchanges between the two 
governments. Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged Shamir to 
take up his offer to start peace talks with Palestinians. Shamir has refused 
because the Bush Administration plan would give an offstage role to the PLO, 
which is demanding the formation of a Palestinian state next to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. officials said Monday that President Bush, in a letter, has 
called on Shamir to explain what he is willing to do to revive peace efforts. 
The letter, which included a conciliatory note of congratulations on the 
formation of a new Israeli government, said Bush hopes Shamir remains committed 
to his own plan of last year, which called for elections of Palestinian 
representatives in the occupied areas. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir is at the head of a newly formed right-wing government and has been 
trying to shift the focus of its diplomacy from the question of Israel's rule 
over 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the country's 
relations with the Arab world at large. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks in Petah Tikva, Shamir repeated that his government program 
gives full priority to the successful immigration of Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir also invited Syria's president, Hafez Assad, to come to Jerusalem and 
talk peace. Syria is demanding return of the Golan Heights, which Israel won 
while repelling a joint Arab invasion in 1967 and annexed 14 years later. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Syrian president wants to come to Israel for talks with us without 
preconditions, we will meet him and welcome him," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter delivered a message from Assad 
indicating the Syrian president's willingness to hold peace talks, although 
such negotiations would "obviously include the Golan Heights." 
</P>
<P>
The foreign policy transition in the new Shamir government began roughly, with 
complaints from the new Foreign Minister David Levy that Shamir is dealing with 
Washington without consulting him. According to Israeli newspaper reports, an 
aide to Shamir told Bush Administration officials that talks with Palestinians 
under Baker's plan are out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Levy blocked delivery of a letter to Egyptian officials through 
Israel's embassy in Cairo, the newspaper Haaretz reported. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Levy said the flap was "blown out of proportion."

GOVERNMENT FOES CORDON OFF BUCHAREST INTERSECTION;

ROMANIA: LAWMAKERS EMPOWER POLICE TO INTERVENE, SETTING UP A NEW CONFRONTATION.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-government protesters cordoned off a busy intersection Monday, and one 
chamber of the Parliament empowered police to break up the demonstration, 
setting up the battle lines for a new confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The brutality unleashed against residents of the capital last week has served 
only to embolden anti-Communist demonstrators, who now sense that President Ion 
Iliescu's new government is on trial with Western democracies. 
</P>
<P>
By reoccupying University Square and obstructing traffic, the protesters have 
put the government on notice that the unrest will end only when their demands 
for dialogue on opposition rights are met. 
</P>
<P>
The newly elected Chamber of Deputies voted to give the police power to move 
against the disturbance, but it was not clear when such action might be taken. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is just boiling," said Victor Bradu, a 34-year-old artist at the 
protest, describing the public mood after last week's violence. 
</P>
<P>
Others said there will be no peace in the capital until Iliescu's leadership 
shows some tolerance toward dissent by allowing independent television to 
operate and by lifting restraints on newspapers that have been critical of his 
National Salvation Front. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters contend that Iliescu's party is a haven for former Communists, 
like himself, who claim to seek a path toward Western democracy while 
repressing opponents in the style of their totalitarian predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu last week summoned to Bucharest a horde of miners who rampaged through 
the city for three days, beating citizens at random with crude clubs and rubber 
hoses. They destroyed the headquarters of Romania's two main opposition parties 
and shut down the newspaper Romania Libera and other publications that had cast 
Iliescu and the front as neo-Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The brutal tactics have given credence to the oppositions' accusations against 
the front and united the student and intellectual communities against the 
government that has ruled since the December overthrow of dictator Nicolae 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who love democracy and liberty and fight against communism will not give 
up simply because the current leaders have reverted to the system we had under 
Ceausescu," said Leonte Teodorescu, a history professor showing solidarity with 
the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo Tokes, an ethnic Hungarian religious leader in Transylvania, has 
suggested that Romania may be headed for "a second revolution" to free itself 
from communism. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu is under strong foreign pressure to restore some semblance of democracy 
in his troubled nation or forgo the Western aid and trade benefits under 
consideration for Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult to mend this breach in their image, as it is a very 
severe one," said a senior West European diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the European Community, meeting in Luxembourg, decided 
Monday to postpone a decision on granting special aid to Romania because of the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the U.S. State Department called Monday for the government to 
immediately release demonstrators they wrongfully jailed last week, and again 
warned that U.S. economic aid will be held back until the government respects 
human rights. 
</P>
<P>
At the parliamentary session that convened Monday, opposition deputies insisted 
that last week's violence be investigated.

ROSTENKOWSKI TELLS MAYORS THEY WON'T SHARE IN 'PEACE DIVIDEND'

<TEXT>
<P>
A leading congressional Democrat bluntly told the nation's mayors Monday that 
they stood no chance of getting billions -- or even millions -- more for urban 
programs from expected federal defense savings. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no money for such programs until the budget blockade is broken," House 
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski told the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors. "The 'peace dividend' is already going to be swallowed." 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's address to the more than 200 mayors discouraged a group that for 
three days had been making the case that cities need a multibillion-dollar 
infusion from the federal government to fight drugs, poverty, housing, 
education and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski came home to Chicago to tell the mayors they would be going it 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Yours is not an easy task," the congressman said in a speech blaming the 
Ronald Reagan Administration for most festering urban problems. He said also 
that Congress was far from ready to come to the aid of mayors and that 
taxpayers were unlikely to support higher taxes to help cities. 
</P>
<P>
"He devastated everybody," Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the mayors heard a somewhat more encouraging talk from Sen. Bob Kerrey 
(D-Neb.). Still, even Kerrey said that "peace dividend" money will not "fall 
like manna from heaven" to cities. The mayors' best hope is to sell their ideas 
to voters, much like Reagan sold his military buildup in the early 1980s, 
Kerrey said. 
</P>
<P>
During the weekend, the mayors crafted an ambitious, costly plan for attacking 
urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the plan was a demand that money from the programs come from 
expected defense cuts, with the mayors seeking half of whatever savings 
materialize. Rostenkowski's speech, in effect, made much of the mayors' new 
lobbying agenda appear moot even before it gets final approval Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski said that he personally would support most of the mayors' causes 
but he decided in advance of the speech not to offer an upbeat prognosis.

WOMEN, BLACKS MAKE UP MAJORITY OF BARRY JURY

A jury composed primarily of women and blacks was seated Monday in the racially 
charged cocaine and perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry, who was arrested after 
a sting operation in which the FBI allegedly videotaped him smoking crack. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 18 people chosen as jurors and alternates, one said that she believed 
race played a role in Barry's prosecution, and another expressed reluctance to 
judge a fellow human. A third woman said that she opposed all undercover 
operations but added that she thought Barry "might" have lied to the grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
Opening statements are set for today. The trial is expected to last a month. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the panel sequestered for 
the duration of the trial at an undisclosed downtown hotel, where newspapers, 
magazines and television broadcasts are to be rigorously censored. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual and unexplained ruling, Jackson has said that he will not 
designate which six of the 18 prospective jurors will be named alternates until 
after all evidence is presented and final summary statements are given. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief session Monday morning, attorneys completed exercising their 
peremptory challenges, which allow each side to dismiss without cause a limited 
number of the 81 District of Columbia residents called as potential jurors in 
the case against one of the nation's most prominent black mayors. 
</P>
<P>
The seven potential jurors dismissed by the prosecution were all black. Of the 
12 dismissed by the defense, 10 were white. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, after all the challenges were exhausted, a dozen black women and 
one black man survived the final cut. Of the five whites on the panel, three 
are women and two are men. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the prospective jurors questioned for the trial expressed strong 
opinions about the case, and many more expressed reluctance to serve on the 
jury. But all said under questioning that they would base their decisions on 
the evidence put before them. 
</P>
<P>
"I am generally pleased at your willingness, if not enthusiasm, to serve as 
jurors in this case," Judge Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, one count of conspiracy 
and three felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury by denying involvement 
with drugs.

shut. The work force, which peaked at 2,500 during the Vietnam War, now numbers 
200. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, although demand for grenade casings has taken a dramatic slump, the 
Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant near Modesto may remain active for decades. 
James F. Gansel, coordinator of the toxic waste cleanup of the plant, predicted 
that the Army will be extracting chromium and cyanide from the ground water 
here for the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials have found that even seemingly insignificant military outposts 
can pose mighty problems. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection 
Agency ranked this little-known base as the Defense Department's No. 1 domestic 
problem. A complex scoring system was used to analyze the types of pollutants 
and the risks they present to people and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock," Gansel said, and EPA officials agreed that Riverbank's 
problems pale in comparison to conditions at McClellan Air Force Base in 
Sacramento or at Edwards Air Force Base in Kern County. (Those bases have far 
more sources of pollution and more varied toxins found in greater volumes.) 
</P>
<P>
Ground water tainted with chromium, a suspected carcinogen, has migrated beyond 
Riverbank's boundaries and fouled five domestic wells. If left untreated, 
reports done for the EPA say, the tainted water could, in time, drift into 
Modesto's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Tackett has lived a short walk from the base since 1964. Lately, she 
has taken to drinking bottled water. She is convinced that, after years of 
drinking water from her household well, her body can tolerate no more of it. "I 
feel like it's going to get me," she said of the water. 
</P>
<P>
A block away, Loyd Fanin said that, when he used to drink the water, he would 
become dizzy, get sick to his stomach and have headaches that made him feel as 
if the back of his head was "going to blow off." 
</P>
<P>
The Army has dug a new well to supply the Fanin home, and tests show the water 
is safe to drink. Still, the Fanins say, their symptoms disappeared after they 
switched to bottled drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope," Barbara Fanin said, "that they find (the cause of their symptoms) 
before Loyd and I kick the bucket and people say, 'Well, I guess there was 
something wrong, after all.' "

About 100 sheriff's deputies undertook an intense search for two girls missing 
since Friday, when they left their desert home on a shopping trip with a family 
friend, authorities said. Silver Putnam, 6, and her stepsister, Kristine 
Johnson, 3, were last seen when they left their home in Pioneertown with Alan 
Erickson, San Bernardino County sheriff's spokesman Jim Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, 36, told the girls' mother, Linda Johnson, that he was going to buy 
motorcycle parts. He and the girls left in a white pickup truck that he 
borrowed from Johnson's boyfriend. When Erickson and the girls had not returned 
by midnight, Johnson called sheriff's deputies. An all-points bulletin was 
issued to authorities in areas Erickson was known to frequent, including the 
High Sierra.

BOY, 14, CHARGED WITH MURDER OF HIS SISTER, 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Murder charges were filed Monday against a 14-year-old Anaheim boy after his 
12-year-old sister died earlier in the day from a gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Gema Marie Hubler, who had been comatose since the shooting last Thursday in 
the upstairs bedroom of their Anaheim Shores home, died at 1:30 p.m. at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange after members of her family decided to remove her from 
a hospital life support system. 
</P>
<P>
The brother, Richard Hubler, who had been arrested after the shooting, remained 
in custody in the Orange County Juvenile Hall. Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent Romney 
said the youth will be tried as a juvenile. A detention hearing is scheduled 
for this morning in Orange County Juvenile Court to determine if he should be 
released to his parents pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth declined Monday to elaborate on why police 
sought the murder charges other than to say: "We have enough cause to file the 
charges, from physical evidence and statements." Hedgpeth said Friday that 
detectives have discredited the brother's original story that his sister had 
been shot during a break-in Thursday by "three masked men." 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the youth when they discovered inconsistencies in his statement 
about the break-in and noted that he did not call for help promptly. Paramedics 
found the unconscious girl covered by a blanket, her head wrapped with white 
bandages. 
</P>
<P>
Neither child had been at school the day of the shooting. Police said the boy 
was alone with his sister and had been firing the weapon earlier in the back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said gunshot residue tests of the youth's hands were taken after the 
shooting and that the results should be available in several days. 
</P>
<P>
According to school records and interviews with classmates of both children, 
Gema was a bright sixth-grader who excelled in science, while her brother, an 
eighth-grader, ran with rougher youths and was on the brink of dropping out.

PADRES' OFFENSE IS AWOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notice was posted early Monday afternoon by Garry Templeton, the Padres' 
shortstop and captain. Team meeting, players only. Five o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
The subject? 
</P>
<P>
The official response: "None of your damn business." 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial response: The Padres still are upset at the San Francisco 
Giants, and in particular reliever Jeff Brantley, for his errant pitch Thursday 
that broke Padre catcher Benito Santiago's left arm. But they decided in the 
meeting that they'll pick their spot for getting even, certainly not wanting to 
make it so obvious. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Padres' latest performance Monday, a 2-1 defeat to the Giants at 
Candlestick Park, the Padre hitters should be informed of the possibility of 
further head-hunting directed their way. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that the guys who might be throwing at them will be 
wearing Padre pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, something's got to be done to wake up the Padre offense, because the 
way these guys are going they'll be out of the National League West race by the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, losers for the third consecutive game and sixth time in seven 
games, once again showed that their offense is little better than the United 
States' World Cup entry. 
</P>
<P>
They have now scored just 15 runs in their past eight games, and are hitting 
.170 in the past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Hell, Giant third baseman Matt Williams has driven in 13 runs by himself the 
past eight games. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we're hitting," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said, pointing toward 
reporters around him, "you guys could hold us to four or five hits." 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Wilson hasn't been issued a press credential to anyone's knowledge, but 
considering that until this month, he had won all of two games in his major 
league career, this guy doesn't exactly strike fear in the hearts of anyone. 
</P>
<P>
So what does the guy do? After pitching a one-hit complete game against the 
Padres last week, he shuts them down again for an encore, yielding just three 
hits in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference was that a week ago, he came within three outs of pitching 
a no-hitter against the Padres at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
His no-hitter ended this time when Bip Roberts singled in the first inning, but 
heck, no reason to be greedy, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a guy who couldn't even make the Giants' beleaguered pitching staff out 
of spring training, has now pitched 16 1/3 shutout innings against the Padres, 
yielding a grand total of four singles. The Padres' cumulative batting average 
against Wilson in his two starts this season: .083. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't think he could be doing this," said Padre right fielder Tony 
Gwynn. "But what can you say? Obviously, we're having a tough time with anyone 
that's out there?" 
</P>
<P>
McKeon juggled his lineup Monday trying to find some magic, and even wiggled 
his fingers at them from his office as if giving them mystical powers. 
</P>
<P>
He moved Gwynn to the leadoff spot for the first time this season. Roberts was 
dropped to the No. 2 spot. And Garry Templeton was moved up a notch to sixth in 
the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? Gwynn goes hitless for his third consecutive games for the 
first time this season, extending his hitless skein to 12 at-bats. Roberto 
Alomar goes zero for four, and now is in a four-for-30 skid. And Joe Carter and 
Jack Clark went hitless once again. 
</P>
<P>
It's mighty tough to win ballgames these days when the top five batters in the 
order go one for 17? 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be easy to blame one guy," Padre starter Ed Whitson said, "but right now, 
you've got a whole ballclub struggling its butt off. I give up two (earned) 
runs in eight innings last time, and two runs in seven innings this time, and I 
got two 'L's" to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't frustrated, but the key now is for everyone to 
keep even-keeled. We all have to hang in there and hope this mess comes to an 
end." 
</P>
<P>
The only time the Padres managed even so much as a rally was in the seventh 
inning when Clark led off with a walk, and Mike Pagliarulo hit a one-out 
single. Giant Manager Roger Craig made sure it would amount to nothing more. He 
called upon Brantley, the pitcher who broke catcher Santiago's left arm last 
week with an errant pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Parent studied Brantley. Dug in at the plate. And smoked Brantley's first 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The only trouble was that it landed smack in Brantley's glove, and it happened 
so fast that Pagliarulo had no chance to get back to first, and Brantley had 
the easy double play. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I hit it, I thought, 'Yeah, we got something here,' " Parent said. 
"But it didn't take more than a second for me to say, 'Damn, here we go again.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Really, the only intrigue of the evening occurred in the eighth inning. Greg 
Harris, who already had hit three batters this season, was on the mound. 
Brantley was at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you," Brantley said, "I was thinking of getting hit. But I 
can't worry about that. I'm not going ot change the way i pitch because i hit 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Harris' first pitch simply was a ball that rose high and inside, but 
not particularly close to Brantley. Three pitches later, Brantley grounded out 
to first. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to do something right there," Harris said. "Hey, it's a 2-1 
game. There's a time and place for everything, and this was not the time." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, many of the 26,388 that showed up at Candlestick came to see a 
spectacle instead of a baseball game. They came to see the feud between the 
Giants and Padres, hearing all about the Padres' quotes last week after 
Santiago's injury. Why else did five Bay area columnists show up at Candlestick 
on a Monday night? 
</P>
<P>
But nothing happened. Just a lot of boos. A whole lot of boos. Most of them 
directed toward Clark. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it was Clark last week who said: "You know how I feel about the 
Giants, anyway, I can't stand them. Now, I just hate them that much worse. 
Their time will come, believe me, their time will come." 
</P>
<P>
And now: 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's changed," Clark said, "but the last thing we want to do is spend all 
of our time thinking about the damn Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got enough problems just taking care of ourselves without worrying about 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Parent: "It was kind of funny the way they were booing us. When we were 
being announced, and they announced Jack, they really booed him. For me, there 
was just a smattering of boos. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack turned around and said to me, 'Hey, not bad. It's a start.' " 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Dennis Rasmussen was diagnosed Monday with a strained left 
shoulder, but still is expected to make his next scheduled start Friday night 
in Atlanta. Dr. Cliff Colwell performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test on 
Rasmussen's shoulder, which proved to be negative. Rasmussen left Sunday's game 
against the Dodgers after one inning, returned to San Diego for an examination 
Monday morning, and rejoined the Padres Monday night. . . . It's official. Joey 
Cora, 5-feet-8, 150 pounds, is the Padres' emergency catcher. Cora went to the 
bullpen before the game and caught Andy Benes. How was it, little guy? "Ah, he 
doesn't throw hard enough for me," Cora said. . . . The Padres drafted Alan 
Benes, the high-school brother of Andy Benes, but sorry, Alan Benes is headed 
to Creighton on a baseball scholarship. "I think it was a courtesy pick, more 
than anything," Andy Benes said. "It was nice they did that, though." . . . 
Padre Manager Jack McKeon was under the weather with a cold Monday. . . . 
Despite the fact that the Giants were averaging 7.6 runs a game in June before 
Monday's game, Dusty Baker, Giant batting coach, said: "Even now, we're not 
getting guys in from third base the way we should. We've got the potential to 
be scoring 10 runs a game. . . . Giant first baseman Will Clark has scored in 
13 consecutive games, four short of the National League record held by Ted 
Kluszewski of Cincinnati in 1954. . . . Giant catcher Gary Carter is just one 
game shy of setting the National League record for most games caught, and he is 
eight games shy of collecting his first $100,000 bonus. He receives $100,000 
bonuses for games 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110. . . . The Padres have 
nominated pitcher Bruce Hurst for the Roberto Clemente Award, which is 
presented annually to the player who best represents the game of baseball both 
and off the field through his humanitarian endeavors. The award will be 
announced July 9 in Chicago, the day before the All-Star Game. . . . The Giants 
placed pitcher Atlee Hammaker on the 15-day disabled list and purchased the 
contract of Randy O'Neal from their triple-A Phoenix club. Hammaker is 
suffering from a hematoma (cyst) under his left tricep muscle. Hammaker is the 
10th player -- sixth pitcher -- to be disabled this season. Just how bad is 
Giants' health these days? Norm Sherry, the Giant pitching coach, is suffering 
from a pulled oblique muscle under his rib cage, requiring the Giants to call 
up Larry Hardy, their triple-A pitching coach. . . . Giant third baseman Matt 
Williams, after batting .533 with three home runs and 12 RBIs and a .967 
slugging percentage, was selected Monday as the National League Player of the 
Week. . . . The Giants have juggled their pitching rotation for the Padre 
series. Francisco Oliveras (0-0) will pitch tonight for the Giants against 
Bruce Hurst (3-6) at 7:35; and John Burkett (7-1) will pitch against Andy Benes 
(6-4) at 12:35 p.m. Wednesday.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: 3-D SYSTEMS SECURES ANOTHER MODELING PATENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
3-D Systems, a Valencia company that manufactures machines for rapidly making 
plastic models, said it won a new patent enlarging the scope of the technology 
to which the company has rights. 
</P>
<P>
With the new patent, 3-D said it believes that all "potentially competitive" 
devices by other companies would infringe on its patents. In April, 3-D accused 
Quadrax Corp. of Rhode Island of infringing on its patents and warned that it 
might file suit against the company. Quadrax had declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
3-D's machines combine a computer, laser and chemicals to make the models.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS TOPS JOB SURVEY IN VENTURA COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Job opportunities in the Oxnard/Ventura/Camarillo region will be modest this 
summer, but the employment outlook is more favorable in Thousand Oaks, 
according to a new study by Manpower Inc., a major employment services concern. 
</P>
<P>
Manpower said its survey of employers in the area showed that 17% plan to hire 
more workers this summer, while 10% expect to cut employment and 70% will be 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 3% were uncertain. The survey indicated that the construction, 
wholesale and retail trades planned the biggest additions to their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, 46% of the businesses surveyed told Manpower that they planned to 
add workers. 
</P>
<P>
In Thousand Oaks, meanwhile, 27% of the employers answering Manpower's latest 
survey said they expect to hire more workers, none saw reductions and 73% plan 
to stay at present levels. 
</P>
<P>
Manpower's survey of the greater Los Angeles area showed that 18% of the 
employers anticipate adding workers, 8% foresee staff cuts and 66% plan no 
changes.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
RAVEL SPECIALIST TO OPEN SYMPHONY'S SUMMERPOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Canadian conductor Boris Brott takes the Hospitality Point podium 
Wednesday evening, he will open the San Diego Symphony's SummerPops season on a 
decidedly sophisticated note. His mainly Ravel program, called "Ravel 
Rhapsody," inaugurates the orchestra's 12 weeks of outdoor programming on 
Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Brott has not failed to include "Bolero," the hummable 1928 ballet 
piece that instantly made the composer world-famous (even before he could count 
to "10"). But Brott's Ravel sampler also includes "La Valse" and the Suite No. 
2 from "Daphnis et Chloe," hardly typical pops selections. 
</P>
<P>
Brott, who is music director of the Hamilton (Ontario) Philharmonic, devised a 
program for Canadian television in 1975 to celebrate the centennial of Ravel's 
birth. In addition to hosting the program, the Ravel specialist conducted the 
Toronto Symphony in a concert of the French composer's orchestral works and 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Brott's chief mentor, celebrated French conductor Pierre Monteux, provided the 
eager young Canadian with a direct connection to Ravel's musical world. 
</P>
<P>
"My initial conducting studies were with Igor Markevitch and Pierre Monteux," 
Brott explained. "Monteux had conducted the premiere performance of 'Daphnis et 
Chloe' and was strongly identified with Ravel." 
</P>
<P>
Having spent two years as Monteux's apprentice in Europe, as well as four 
summers at the conductor's summer music camp in Maine, Brott said he felt he 
had gained almost a direct link with the composer. Many of Monteux's Ravel 
scores were annotated during conversations with the composer. 
</P>
<P>
"Monteux's view of Ravel was very classical, that is, he stressed the 
composer's desire to achieve a clear sense of form, as opposed to the blurred 
image of the Impressionist label his music is usually given. Ravel's music is 
conductor's music, in the sense that it plays the orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Brott made his SummerPops debut last season and returned in December to conduct 
a week of the San Diego Symphony's concerts for student audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Last chance for the mighty Wurlitzer. This Sunday, members of the Theatre Organ 
Society of San Diego will bid farewell to the soon-to-be-demolished California 
Theatre with a 2 p.m. concert on the aging movie palace's Wurlitzer theatre 
organ. Four local organists, Chris Gorsuch, Chuck Kramarich, Russ Peck and Greg 
Breed, will perform on the city's second-largest theatre organ before it is 
dismantled and put into storage. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-rank Wurlitzer, which is owned by the society, was installed in the 
California Theatre in 1977, and the first concert was presented a year later. 
According to society member Bob Brooks, the California Theatre's original 
eight-rank instrument had been long gone, having been sold to a local Catholic 
church after talkies made theatre organs obsolete. The society's Wurlitzer came 
from a movie theater in Santa Rosa and was purchased for the society by local 
organ aficionado Preston M. (Sandy) Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, Theatre Organ Society members will remove the Wurlitzer from the 
California Theatre and put it into storage while they locate a new home for 
their prized instrument. According to society president Jackie Cornell, it will 
be out of commission for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the Wurlitzer should go to the North Park or Balboa theatres, it would 
take two to three years before these facilities were ready for concerts. At the 
moment, however, the whole thing is still out in left field. In the meantime, 
we will probably give concerts using electronic organs or meet in members' 
homes that have (theater) pipe organs," said Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
Mazeltov! Friday night at Temple Beth Israel, cantor Sheldon Merel will be 
honored for 10 years of service at San Diego's oldest Reform synagogue. Merel 
is well-known in the local musical community, both for the synagogue's 
excellent music program and for his leadership in local interfaith musical 
concerts. Last month, Merel organized the "Blended Voices" concert at Symphony 
Hall, which put the choirs of five San Diego churches on stage with the Jewish 
Community Center Orchestra and the musicians of Temple Beth Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Rumble in the park. Balboa Park's Spreckels Organ is armed with a new rank of 
pedal pipes whose low roar is equal to the sound of planes landing and taking 
off from nearby Lindbergh Field. On June 10, civic organist Robert Plimpton 
inaugurated the new 32-foot Bombarde in his regular Sunday afternoon recital. 
He demonstrated the new stop's ability to snarl in French toccatas -- Plimpton 
opened his program with Widor's popular Toccata from the Fifth Organ Symphony 
-- and to undergird the fugues of J.S. Bach with fiery accent. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the lowest pipe of the new Bombarde is indeed 32 feet in 
length, and its pitch is a mere 16 cycles per second. (The lowest C on a piano 
is still an octave higher than the low C of the Bombarde.) The term Bombarde 
comes from the French organ-building tradition and denotes the brightest and 
loudest reed stops on an organ. 
</P>
<P>
According to Plimpton, the new Bombarde has added the necessary sonic 
foundation to the brilliant trumpet stops added to the organ over the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to Plimpton's recital, Salvatore Giametta, San Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor's assistant for the arts and cultural affairs, had proclaimed June 10 
as Spreckels Organ Day and praised the works of the Spreckels Organ Society, 
which raised the $50,000 to acquire and install the new Bombarde. Society 
president Vivian Evenson presented to Giametta the new stop and several other 
recent improvements to the Spreckels Organ. The instrument, which was given to 
the city in 1915 by local businessman John D. Spreckels and his brother, 
Adolph, is the world's largest outdoor pipe organ. 
</P>
<P>
Haydn at night. As part of Balboa Park's diamond jubilee observances, the San 
Diego Master Chorale will perform Haydn's oratorio "The Creation" in the organ 
pavilion June 25 at 8 p.m. Under the direction of music director Frank Almond 
and accompanied by civic organist Robert Plimpton, this choral concert 
duplicates a 1915 performance of the oratorio during the Panama-California 
Exposition.

WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conventional wisdom has it that the Germans may become so preoccupied 
reconstructing the eastern half of their soon-to-be-unified country that the 
powerful economic sway they have exercised in the rest of the old East Bloc 
could suffer. 
</P>
<P>
There are strong signs, however, that indicate otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"We're beginning a time when it couldn't be better for us Germans," declared 
Heinrich Machowski, an Eastern Europe specialist at the German Institute for 
Economic Research here. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Germany's continued powerful influence may be all that's really certain 
about East Europe's near-term economic future. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons why: 
</P>
<P>
* Of all the Western economies, none are in a better postion than Germany to 
participate in the revival of Eastern Europe. As command economies fall, German 
business contacts extending back to czarist times in the Soviet Union -- and a 
shared Middle European outlook with the Czechoslovaks, Poles and Hungarians -- 
give them an enormous marketing advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Delivery distances are short and German is, de facto, the lingua franca of 
business in many parts of the region. 
</P>
<P>
* With American banks still smarting from their Latin American experience, West 
German financial institutions, led by the powerful Deutsche Bank, already 
dominate the region. Their influence in directing investment will be 
considerable. 
</P>
<P>
Advisers from the federal Bundesbank now assist East European central banks, 
further extending German influence in these countries as they move toward 
convertable currencies and market economies. 
</P>
<P>
* While West German industry, already working at nearly full capacity, is 
certain to channel much of its energy into reviving East Germany over the next 
year or so, defense-related capacity is likely to free up and could be reshaped 
to meet the future demands of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
* With East Germany, a united Germany inherits a wealth of knowledge, 
experience and existing markets in Eastern Europe, especially with the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Specific enterprises such as the Carl-Zeiss Jena optics works of the Robtron 
electronics combine are key suppliers of high technology to the Soviet Union, 
while about 40% of all agricultural machinery, a third of all pharmaceuticals 
and a fifth of all machine tools imported by Moscow today come from East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This is unlikely to change in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his East German counterpart, Lothar de 
Maiziere, have both assured anxious Soviet leaders that a united Germany plans 
to honor East Germany's existing trade commitments -- even if it means 
extending production of obsolete goods that cannot be marketed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Such a pledge is a double plus for the Germans. It eases relations with Moscow 
yet ensures the jobs of hundreds of thousands of East German industrial workers 
at a time when millions of others may become jobless in the face of competition 
from the West. 
</P>
<P>
* Moscow is pressing Bonn for money and technical help -- lots of it -- as the 
price for a quick Soviet endorsement of German unity and relinquishment of its 
rights in Berlin and Germany that still linger as the result of victory in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
While Soviet pride makes any official, direct quid pro quo unlikely, such help 
is likely to come in the form of economic assistance or credits, either of 
which would add further impetus to a German-Soviet economic relationship 
already rich in potential. 
</P>
<P>
Even before last fall's collapse of communism, West Germany was well entrenched 
in the East, responsible for 20% of all Moscow's trade with the West and more 
than half of Poland's joint ventures with Western companies. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, as Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn ordered the first hole 
cut in the Iron Curtain, Hungarian enterprises had 200 joint ventures with West 
German firms, compared to 20 with American, six with French and about 10 with 
Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
Since the autumn of 1988, the West German government has also extended large 
deutschemark credit lines to Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
(For West Germany, a country that vies with the United States as the world's 
largest exporter, Eastern Europe remains small beer. Total West German trade 
with the region may have jumped 16% last year to $843 million, but this still 
amounted to less than half the country's trade with Italy. 
</P>
<P>
(Two-thirds of East Germany's $55 billion foreign trade, however, is with 
members of the crumbling, Soviet-led Comecon trading bloc.) 
</P>
<P>
While strong cultural, historic and geographic advantages all pull the likes of 
Krupp, Daimler-Benz and machine tool builder Liebherr East, other elements also 
play a role. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans are particularly well-suited to East European conditions, tending 
to accept even marginal profits in order to gain a sales foothold. Unlike most 
American companies, West Germans are frequently content to wait five to eight 
years for decent returns. 
</P>
<P>
Such patience is important, because few of those familiar with present 
conditions in Eastern Europe predict any quick killings. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Eastern European market, long renowned as tough, has 
become only more hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
One warning sign: The Soviet Union and its Comecon allies already labor under a 
collective hard currency debt of $130 billion before the serious business of 
restructuring antique, inefficient industries has even begun. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has suspended foreign debt payment, Poland struggles under the weight 
of large Western loans and for the first time the Soviets have also fallen 
about $6 billion behind in payments to the West. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Moscow, one of German industry's leading figures in 
dealing with eastern business, Otto Wolff von Amerognen, with West German 
Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann at his side, had to prod Moscow to pay 
overdue bills. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no easy money from Eastern economies," said Machowski. 
</P>
<P>
West German bankers, businessmen and economists predict an extremely difficult, 
possibly unstable, transition period in which old state-owned economies are 
forced to adjust to Western competition, shed manpower and scrap obsolete 
plants and build new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at five hard years," predicted Karsten Oschmann, an East Europe 
trade expert at the Cologne-based German Industry Assn. "This is a medium- to 
long-term market." 
</P>
<P>
Current uncertainty makes even vague estimates of future market size virtually 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Says Machowski, "No one knows how expensive the transition is going to be or 
how long it's going to take, but if you look into the 21st Century, it's easier 
to predict." 
</P>
<P>
His scenario: A European Community, with Germany as the economic locomotive, 
will develop extremely close relations with the East, probably forging a free 
trade agreement, such as the United States now has with Canada, rather than 
full community membership. 
</P>
<P>
A slightly more distant, yet important, economic relationship will also develop 
between the Soviet Union and the EC as limits on technology transfers from West 
to East begin to melt in the new spirit of international cooperation and a 
radical overhaul of the Soviet economy begins.

Narrowing the Gap

While there are still horrendous gaps in the level of development between the 
First and Third Worlds, some gaps have closed during the last four decades.

The United Nation's development program's new Human Development Index is a 
composite derived from the performance of each country in three areas: life 
expectancy at birth, the rate of adult literacy, and income for a decent living 
standard. The higher the number, the more desirable the level of human 
development. 
</P>
<P>
2. While economic performance is intimately tied to levels of social 
development, it is equally important how a country uses its wealth. Some 
countries with modest levels of per capita income have achieved high levels of 
human development, while others with rapid growth and comparatively high income 
levels have not shown commensurate improvement in fulfilling basic human needs. 
</P>
<P>
3. Here's a look at some of the countries with the greatest disparity between 
their level of wealth and their human development performance. With 130 
countries evaluated, these figures are based on each nation's ranking in terms 
of gross national product per capita, less its ranking according to the U.N.'s 
Human Development Index. (see below) The lower the rating, the worse the 
country's record of translating its wealth into a comparable level of human 
development.

NOW LANDING IN ASIA'S AIRWAYS: A TRAFFIC JAM; 
</P>
<P>
AIR CARRIERS ARE ADDING FLIGHTS, BUYING PLANES AND STAKING OUT SKY SPACE TO 
KEEP UP WITH THE TRANSPORTATION BOOM.

Air travel is booming in Asia, fueled by a burgeoning regional economy and an 
explosion of tourism. Airlines are flying at capacity, causing profits on Asian 
routes to soar. But the result has been a crush that has left the area's 
airports backed up with the kind of delays common in U.S. airports. 
</P>
<P>
Bangkok is a good example of the rapid expansion of the Asian market. With 
nearly 5 million visitors now stopping in Thailand each year, getting to 
Bangkok can be a hassle. Northwest now has a daily flight to Bangkok, United is 
expanding to 13 flights a week and Delta has started a daily jumbo service via 
Seoul and Taipei. Nonetheless, "we anticipate a really full season," says 
Northwest's Bangkok manager, James P. Reihnoldt. "There's been a phenomenal 
surge in traffic." . . . Competition among the airlines is so hot that the 
Thais are threatening to allow their air traffic rights agreement with the 
United States to lapse Sept. 30 because U.S. carriers are getting more access 
to Thailand than the United States gives the national carrier Thai 
International. Currently, U.S. carriers can fly unlimited flights into Bangkok 
and beyond, but Thai International gets only five flights a week on the 
lucrative Tokyo-Seattle route. . . . Strangely, the Thais are not using their 
unlimited access to Los Angeles, which is considered the most profitable air 
route over the Pacific. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific recently 
inaugurated direct flights to Los Angeles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the boom, airlines are expanding as fast as new aircraft can be 
rolled off the assembly line. According to one study, 50% of the customers for 
Boeing's new 747-400 are in Asia. The planes are the world's largest passenger 
jets and cost upwards of $136 million each. . . . Singapore Airways, for 
example, has taken delivery of 14 of the new jets and has placed further orders 
for 15 more. . . . Japan Air Lines has 20 747-400s on order and options on 34 
more in a transaction that could ultimately be worth $9.3 billion. . . . China 
Airlines late last month ordered 36 commercial jetliners and took options on 36 
more as part of what is reputed to be the largest international deal in China's 
history. . . . Boeing's latest Asian customer is Korean Airlines, which has 
agreed to buy 23 747-400s for nearly $4 billion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trying to cope with all this travel expansion is proving a massive headache for 
the region's airports, which are already operating near capacity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The worst is Tokyo's Narita Airport, which handled 20 million passengers last 
year, a 7% increase. Narita has just one terminal and runway; farmers and 
environmentalists have managed to stall the remainder of the airport's 
construction. . . . Plans are under way to expand Tokyo's other airport at 
Haneda by 50,000 flights a year to 230,000, but most of the increase will be 
for domestic traffic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Seoul is also benefiting from the traffic pileup at Narita Airport, with 
airlines such as American and Delta increasingly bypassing Tokyo completely and 
using Seoul as a regional hub. . . . Delta's service from Seoul to Bangkok 
capitalizes on a new phenomenon: tourism within Asia. South Korea only started 
allowing people under 50 to travel abroad in 1988, and the number of South 
Korean tourists has already hit 1.5 million a year. . . . Last year, 2.1 
million Taiwanese went abroad. . . . The Japanese are still Asia's most 
numerous tourists, with 8.5 million going abroad in 1988. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has announced plans for a $16-billion airport and container port 
terminal off Western Lantau Island to be completed by 1997, just when the 
British colony is reverting to Chinese rule. . . . The new airport will augment 
the legendary Kai Tak airport, which is estimated to reach its saturation point 
in 1994. . . . But the government in Beijing has expressed coolness to the plan 
because of fears it will get stuck with a massive bill, and that has caused 
international lenders to hesitate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a competitor in nearby Macao, the Portuguese colony, which is 
opening a $450-million airport across the Pearl River in 1993. . . . The Macao 
airport offers much less congestion than Hong Kong and easier access to China. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Changi Airport has long been considered the best in the region if 
not the world, from the fitness center in the waiting area to the free local 
telephones for passengers and taxi drivers who are required by law to be 
polite. . . . Changi is building a second terminal that is expected to come on 
stream later in 1990, capable of handling 4,000 passengers an hour. . . . In 
typical Singapore high-tech fashion, passengers will be whisked from one 
terminal to the other by an elevated "Skytrain." . . . Construction on a third 
terminal is slated to begin next year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Just about the only part of Asia left untouched by the air boom is Indochina, 
with both Vietnam and Cambodia still using runways laid down by the U.S. 
military in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Tan Son Nhut Airport in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, is a traveler's 
nightmare, with chaotic boarding lines that frequently end up in shoving 
matches or fistfights. . . . Ho Chi Minh City is now served by Air France, Thai 
International, Air Malaysia, Indonesia's Garuda and Philippine Airlines, but 
reservations can still take weeks. . . . Phnom Penh is served only by Air 
Vietnam and Air Kampuchea operating aging Antonov jets. . . . Thai 
International has sent a survey team to the Cambodian capital to assess the 
airport safety for possible future landings. . . . But Cambodia's political 
isolation is expected to keep air service at a minimum for several months at 
least.

VICTORY ISN'T SUDDEN FOR IRWIN; 
</P>
<P>
BIRDIE ON 91ST HOLE WINS OPEN IN PLAYOFF 
</P>

<P>
Hale Irwin said he had a dream a few weeks ago that he had won the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife can verify it," Irwin said Monday. "So dreams do come true." 
</P>
<P>
It took a while, though, for his dream to become a reality as Irwin and Mike 
Donald were still tied after an 18-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the first sudden-death hole, the par-four, 385-yard No. 1, Irwin sank 
a 10-foot birdie putt to win. 
</P>
<P>
At age 45, he became the oldest player to win the U.S. Open. He also won the 
Open in 1974 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
This victory did not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin was two shots behind Donald after 15 holes and didn't narrow the gap 
until he birdied the par-four, 424-yard 16th hole, regarded as the most 
difficult on the course. 
</P>
<P>
Donald, 34, still had a one-stroke lead going to the 18th hole, but he hooked 
his tee shot into the trees. His second shot found a greenside bunker and he 
was 15 feet short of the cup on his sand shot. 
</P>
<P>
He two-putted from there for a bogey, and Irwin two-putted from 25 feet for a 
par. 
</P>
<P>
So, for the first time since the U.S. Open adopted an 18-hole playoff formula, 
there was sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
Other tour events, including the Masters, have a sudden-death format after the 
regulation 72 holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I must admit that you never know that you'll have the opportunity again," 
Irwin said of his victory. "You hope to, and down inside I thought I would have 
the opportunity, but having it and doing it are two separate events. 
</P>
<P>
"And, for a while, it looked like it would just be an opportunity. I was 
quickly digging myself into a deep hole, and Mike was playing the kind of golf 
that I would have tried to play had I been one or two strokes up. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a great round of golf for either one of us. I think both of us felt 
that it would go right down to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin and Donald, playing in only his fourth U.S. Open after missing the cut in 
two of them, each shot two-over-par 74s for 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a memorable round in that respect, but a grinding, intense one with 
the swirling winds at Medinah making club selection difficult, especially on 
the par-three holes over Lake Kadijah. 
</P>
<P>
Donald had birdied the playoff hole three consecutive times: Saturday, Sunday 
and then earlier Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a suspicion that someone would birdie that hole," Donald said when they 
began the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
However, it wasn't him. He said he didn't quite catch a sand wedge from 118 
yards on the fairway and his shot stopped 30 feet from the cup. He then putted 
to within three feet, opening the door for Irwin to end the match with his 
birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember even hitting the putt," Irwin said, "but just saw it go into 
the hole." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin was, of course, elated, but he didn't charge around the green, 
high-fiving spectators and blowing kisses as he did when he made a 45-foot putt 
Sunday on the 18th green to get into the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, hug his wife, Sally, and daughter, Becky. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the birdie putt on the playoff hole was the clincher. But his most 
important shot probably came on the 16th hole. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was 207 yards from the pin and he hit a two-iron, hooking it around 
trees with the ball landing eight feet from the cup. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin made his birdie putt, Donald got his par, but his lead was cut to one 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
Each player parred the par-three 17th hole, and then Donald bogeyed the 18th 
hole, setting up a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin was in the Open on a special exemption. Open winners have a 10-year 
exemption and his had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Others who have had special exemptions have never won the Open. Ben Hogan made 
the best showing in 1966 by finishing 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin said he had trouble sleeping Sunday night, but didn't knock the 18-hole 
playoff format, saying that it suits a major championship. 
</P>
<P>
He also had some kind words for his less-experienced opponent. Donald has won 
one tour event in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought that Mike Donald could play, but more important, he has 
proved it to himself," Irwin said. "I don't generally feel sorry for an 
opponent, but my heart goes out to him because I know how important it was to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a way to share in this championship, I would always hope that 
Mike would be known as one who was very game and gave it a good effort. 
</P>
<P>
"But he'll be back. He has got some good experience now and that bogey at the 
last hole, as shattering as it may be, if construed correctly, will be a very 
positive learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
Donald shot a 64 in the opening round of the Masters in April and then had an 
82 the second day to shoot himself out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his game really wasn't good enough to compete on that level, but 
he has worked to improve on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I have moved to another level," Donald said. "I hope to go on 
playing good golf. However, nobody remembers who finished second." 
</P>
<P>
Donald said that Irwin's experience of playing in 21 Opens helped him. 
</P>
<P>
"After the 11th hole, he was getting pretty frustrated, but he held himself 
together," Donald said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the par-four, 462-yard 12th hole, Irwin pulled his drive into the deep 
rough. He had a narrow opening through the trees to the green and he pitched up 
short. But he scrambled for a bogey when the outcome could have been much 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin was still two strokes behind at the 14th hole, where they both got 
birdies. 
</P>
<P>
"There was pressure on Hale," Donald said. "If he doesn't make that birdie putt 
(from six feet), I would be up by three strokes." 
</P>
<P>
"Up to that time, I wasn't concentrating," Irwin said. "I was concerned with 
other things, like what Mike is going to hit. But then I began to focus on what 
I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin said he never believed that his age was detrimental to his ability as a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt about myself that tenacity was something I had, that 
never-give-up attitude," Irwin said. "That would apply to most things I try to 
do. You can call it guts, you can call it experience, you can call it a number 
of things. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never abandoned my beliefs. They may have been set aside, or temporarily 
misplaced, but they've always been there." 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Thompson, Georgetown basketball coach, is considering an offer to become 
general manager of the Denver Nuggets after meeting with Nugget owners Peter 
Bynoe, Bertram Lee and Bob Wussler. 
</P>
<P>
USA Today reported that Thompson was offered a $700,000-a-year contract for 
four or five years and was given a chance to gain almost 4% ownership of the 
team, depending on how long he stayed with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say I'll be coaching at Georgetown next year," Thompson said. "That's 
what I believe will happen, (but) we are exploring our options. I think I owe 
it to myself to listen any time somebody proposes something to me." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson has an 18-year record of 423-142. He led the Hoyas to the 1984 NCAA 
title and coached the United States in the 1988 Olympics.

U.S. Attorney Stephen Markman said Detroit Piston guard Isiah Thomas is not the 
target of a gambling investigation or federal criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
"While I am not, of course, able to describe the details of any grand jury 
investigation, given the prominence of Thomas and the attention that this 
matter has received, I would like to clarify the record as best I can at this 
time," Markman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Thomas initiated contact with the FBI after a story about the gambling 
investigation was aired Friday, and he said Thomas has cooperated in the 
ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The report, based on anonymous sources, said checks made out to Thomas were 
cashed at a grocery store owned by a man being investigated for money 
laundering.

FLORENCE, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sun shines most of the time. What rain there is brings a welcome cool. In 
the late, lazy afternoons a mist forms on the Arno and the river itself seems 
to rise and shroud the city's graceful bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Embraced by Florence's serene beauty and calm it is difficult to comprehend the 
actions of soccer hooligans in Cagliari and Milan. Or the rampage of basketball 
fans that left seven dead in Detroit last week. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, relative to Florence's blase attitude toward the World Cup, any 
emotional display generated by sport -- and not by art or music or beauty -- 
seems uncivilized. This passion people hold for sport and art are made odd 
bedfellows this summer in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything the duality of the beautiful and the ugly has emerged as a 
dominant theme in the first 10 days of the World Cup. The graceful and creative 
play of some of the world's best soccer players is surely as artful as 
Michelangelo's rendering of a marble David. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, has the good and bad of the World Cup impinged on the life of the 
Italian people. For some, la dolce vita has been soured in a morass of 
construction delays on roads, overburdened phone lines and, in some cities, 
hordes of nasty soccer fans in too-small T-shirts swilling beer. 
</P>
<P>
Florence has not had this experience. Nationwide, authorities estimate tourism 
is off by 20% to 30%. But in Florence, the number must be higher. After the 
World Cup draw last December, the business community of Florence rejoiced that 
Group A would include Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia and the United States. 
Americans, observed one Florentine restaurant owner, tip well and "are 
well-behaved." 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, there aren't many American soccer fans here, or from any other 
teams in the group. This may account for some of Florence's failure to kick 
into full World Cup frenzy. Part of it is the city itself, and part of it is 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
There are some here to whom the idea of painting your face and screeching at a 
soccer game is disgusting. They have their art, their music and their beauty. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt these are some of the same people who spat upon members of the 
national team when they assembled here. No, there is no lack of passion for 
soccer, just no great interest in the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Those Italians who do bear allegiance to the national team aren't in Florence, 
because the team has based itself in and around Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrians have been commuter fans -- driving into town for the games in 
their well-maintained automobiles, wearing their pointy red and white hats. 
Whatever money they might have spent in restaurants or bars is not forthcoming, 
either, as they seem to be packing their own lunches. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechs aren't here because they have little money to spend on such 
indulgences. Those fans who simply could not bear to miss this have been 
sleeping in their cars and in the Florence train station, cheerily bedding down 
in the hubbub, happy to be a part of this spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechs have been rewarded by their team's fairly remarkable romp through 
Group A. Undefeated Czechoslovakia plays Italy tonight in Rome to determine the 
winner of the group. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechs celebrated doubly last week, having held a free and democratic 
election and beating the United States, a longtime symbol of democracy, on the 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
At least for the Czechs there is stability. For the Romanians there is only the 
fear and uncertainty that comes of too much upheaval and too little news. 
</P>
<P>
It has been agonizing for Romanian players and fans who have seen television 
footage of beatings and mass arrests in Bucharest. Ugliness amid the beauty. 
</P>
<P>
To date some 100 Romanians have requested political asylum in Italy. Some 
Romanians, fearful of returning home, are approaching anyone -- even 
journalists -- seeking a safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
A busload of soccer fans traveled to the town of Telese, where the Romanian 
team is training. When they arrived, the Romanians begged the mayor of the tiny 
town to grant them asylum. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor could only tell them to go on to Rome. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them crying in these last few days," the mayor, Pino D'Occhio, said. 
"It was anguishing for us. Imagine what it was like for them." But there was 
also some gladness amid the sadness. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Romanian fans and officials were invited to the World Cup by the 
Italian government, in recognition of the heroism of Romania's anti-Communist 
revolution last December. Italians of another generation well remember their 
own lives under a Fascist yoke. 
</P>
<P>
And, just when humanity raises its voice the loudest, there is a small cry for 
human decency, too. 
</P>
<P>
Last week a Romanian journalist who saved for 18 months to cover the World Cup 
was robbed of his passport and most of his money. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter, Radu Timofte, slept in his car to save money and thieves in the 
southern city of Bari broke into his car, leaving him only $10. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters and officials, when they heard of Timofte's plight, took up a 
collection in a gesture the Romanian called "beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Beauty, it seems, requires ugliness to give it resonance.

To have a chance to become one of four third-place teams advancing to the 
second round of the World Cup, the United States must beat Austria by at least 
three goals tonight in a Group A game in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not all. 
</P>
<P>
Entering Monday night, the United States needed any two of the following five 
developments in the final week of first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
Group B, Monday -- At least a 3-0 victory by Argentina over Romania in Naples 
and a two-goal loss by Cameroon to the Soviet Union in Bari. Cameroon lost, 
4-0, but Argentina and Romania tied, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Group C, Wednesday -- At least 2-0 victories by Brazil over Scotland in Turin 
and Sweden over Costa Rica in Genoa. 
</P>
<P>
Group D, Tuesday -- At least a 3-0 victory by West Germany over Colombia in 
Milan. 
</P>
<P>
Group E, Thursday -- A South Korea-Uruguay tie in Udine. 
</P>
<P>
Group F, Thursday -- At least 2-0 victories by England over Egypt in Cagliari 
and the Netherlands over Ireland in Palermo. 
</P>
<P>
Shutouts are important in games indicated because goals scored is the second 
tiebreaker. The first tiebreaker is goal differential. All 12 first- and 
second-place teams in the six groups advance. RANDY HARVEY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asked Monday about his soccer team's chances to advance to the World Cup's 
second round, U.S. Coach Bob Gansler acted as though it gave him a headache to 
think about it. His subject when he taught at the University of Wisconsin 
Milwaukee was history, not math. 
</P>
<P>
"The mathematical possibilities would require Einstein at his best," Gansler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Without Einstein at their disposal, U.S. players turned to one of their own, 
defender Paul Krumpe of Redondo Beach, an aerospace engineering major at UCLA 
who quit his job at McDonnell Douglas to play for the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Using a computer at the training camp here, Krumpe discovered a scenario 
involving six combinations of events and 18 teams that would enable the United 
States to become one of the 16 teams in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still within the realm of possibility, but it would be extremely 
difficult," Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
So Gansler has spent the four days since a 1-0 loss to Italy in Rome preparing 
his team for the only variable it can control, a three-goal or better victory 
over Austria tonight in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
Also winless after two games in the four-team Group A, the Austrians have an 
equally long wish list. It starts with a two-goal or better victory over the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer experts would say that Austria has a better chance of achieving its 
desired result than does the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But soccer experts also said before the tournament that the Americans would 
score no goals in their three first-round games. It took them about an hour to 
prove the experts wrong on a goal by midfielder Paul Caligiuri in a 5-1 opening 
loss to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
That might not be much, but it is one more goal than has been scored by the 
Austrians. 
</P>
<P>
With forwards Gerhard Rodax and Toni Polster, the second- and third-leading 
scorers in European professional leagues this season, Austria entered the World 
Cup with one of the most respected offenses. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1-0 losses to Italy and Czechoslovakia, the midfielders had difficulty 
getting the ball to the forwards. That has resulted in frustration and 
dissension that might lead tonight to humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
According to Monday's Presse, a Vienna newspaper, the Austrians "are even 
starting to fear the much-mocked Americans." 
</P>
<P>
With speculation rampant in Austria that he will be fired if his team loses to 
the United States, Coach Josef Hickersberger has announced two midfield changes 
and added a third forward, Andreas Ogris. 
</P>
<P>
Expecting an all-out assault from the Austrians at the beginning of the game, 
the U.S. players said they will employ the same nine-men-back defensive tactics 
that they used so effectively against Italy, but with more assertive 
counterattacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Austria came to the World Cup with high expectations," U.S. defender Desmond 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hold together defensively, we can frustrate them and then get a 
counterattack going. If we score against them first, they might fold." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who did not allow Italian striker Gianluca Vialli a shot Thursday 
night, draws Rodax, the No. 1 scorer in the Austrian League, for this game. 
Defender John Doyle of Fremont, Calif., has responsibility for the larger, less 
mobile Polster, the No. 2 scorer in the Spanish League. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes you wonder about the Spanish League," Armstrong said. "Polster only 
plays with his left foot." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Doyle is more concerned about Polster. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a proven scorer," Doyle said. "Maradona hasn't scored any goals here, but 
you know he's a scorer. Polster will break out of this. I just hope he doesn't 
do it against me." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler said the difference in his team from the first game to the second was 
its level of intensity. Based on practices this week, he said he believes the 
players will maintain the intensity they displayed against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
But he felt it necessary to call a team meeting Sunday night because he was 
concerned the players might be distracted by questions about their future. 
</P>
<P>
Six players -- midfielders Tab Ramos of Hillside, N.J., John Harkes of Kearny, 
N.J., and Caligiuri of Santa Monica, forwards Peter Vermes of Delran, N.J., and 
Chris Sullivan of Redwood City, Calif. and Doyle -- are in the preliminary 
stages of negotiating to play professionally in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Soccer Federation is negotiating a deal for Ramos with Roda, a 
first-division team in the Netherlands. The player with the best prospects, 
however, might be Caligiuri, who has had contacts with two teams, Parma and 
Cagliari, in the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done a lot of talking about what guys are going to do after the World 
Cup," said Vermes, who played for Volendam in the Dutch first division last 
season and is talking with teams in Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's important that we do well as a team. We were all trying to do too 
much individually against Czechoslovakia. Maybe we had professional contracts 
on our minds. 
</P>
<P>
"Against Italy, we realized that we'll look good as individuals only if the 
team plays well. It's important that we keep that in mind against Austria."

TWO BRUINS REPORTEDLY WILL TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two UCLA football players, including a potential defensive starter, have 
announced plans to transfer, a spokesman for UCLA's sports information office 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Gilbert, a sophomore flanker from Huntsville, Tex., will transfer to 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
He played sparingly as a redshirt freshman last season, failing to catch a 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Bates, a 6-foot-4, 215-pound sophomore strong safety from Galveston, 
Tex., has not announced his plans, but told the Galveston Daily News that he 
has visited Houston and has scheduled visits to Miami and Texas A&amp;M. He 
also is considering Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, who two years ago at Ball High in Galveston was considered the nation's 
No. 1 safety prospect, was expected to play next season behind junior Matt 
Darby and senior Eric Turner. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Terry Donahue said at the end of spring practice: "We're 
(alternating) three safeties and Bates is right in the hunt for a starting 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Bates, one of only two Bruins to play last season as a true freshman, told the 
Galveston Daily News: ". . . The bottom line was, UCLA was not the place for 
me."

REALTORS TRY HARDER AS THE SELLING LIFE GETS A LOT TOUGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Real estate agent Therese Marcus is in an enviable position. The top sales 
agent in the Studio City office of Prudential California Realty last year, 
Marcus will likely match her 1989 volume this year, even though the home sales 
rate in the San Fernando Valley and most of the Los Angeles area has plunged 
about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
But Marcus' success won't come without a price. She's working longer hours. 
She's fighting more with clients who refuse to lower their asking prices when 
their homes have been on the market for months. And she won't make as much 
money because she has to spend more to get the sales. 
</P>
<P>
That's a sharp contrast to a year or two ago, when the Southern California 
housing market was soaring and homes sold so fast that agents didn't have to 
bother with the kinds of marketing activities typical in a "normal" market. By 
the time a promotional flyer could be printed, a home was already in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you have to do flyers, more ads, magazines, cable TV shows. I've already 
spent more money, more time than last year," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Southland, real estate agents such as Marcus are feeling the 
pressures of the area's housing market slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most jarring indication that times have become tough for agents was 
the recent failure of the San Fernando Valley's largest residential brokerage, 
Mike Glickman Realty Inc. On June 6, Glickman closed its five offices, laid off 
more than 1,200 agents and filed for bankruptcy liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman's downfall has been largely blamed on overly rapid expansion and a 
failure to change course when the market headed south. Glickman spent 
extravagantly on perks for its agents and continued to give them a 
larger-than-average share of commissions. That strategy became unmanageable 
when the market slowed, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Brokerages and their agents say Glickman's failure serves as a reminder that 
they must adjust to a new market reality. Now that prices have flattened, 
buyers are becoming choosier and more demanding, more likely to ask sellers to 
make repairs or help them obtain financing. And homes take several months to 
sell -- rather than a few days or even hours. Accordingly, brokerages and 
agents say basic marketing techniques and sound business practices are again 
the priority. 
</P>
<P>
"In a hot market, anybody can make money," said Marcus. But now, she said, a 
good sales agent will work twice as hard to find that elusive buyer. Many 
agents say they're going back to their old bag of tricks to drum up business, 
including holding more open houses for prospective buyers, hosting lunches for 
buyers' agents to get more exposure for their homes, and cutting their own 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers and their agents are even offering incentives to buyers' agents, such 
as free trips and cash bonuses. One listing agent offered a seven-day trip for 
two to Hawaii to any agent successful in finding a buyer for a house in Encino 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Brokerage firms say they're re-evaluating basic business practices, with an eye 
toward keeping costs down and sales volume up. At Prudential California, for 
example, corporate overhead is being cut in non-sales-generating areas -- by 
consolidating accounting offices, for example. 
</P>
<P>
However, Prudential is spending more on advertising and promotions. For 
instance, the firm will spend $750,000 this year on a slick new magazine that 
shows off its ritziest properties. It has also stepped up training for its 
agents in negotiation skills. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest firms in the Southland -- Fred Sands Realtors, Jon Douglas Co. and 
Prudential -- say they're looking to lure more foreign buyers and have recently 
aligned themselves with brokerages in Japan, Taiwan and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Some agents have also turned to foreign buyers to compensate for the lack of 
local buyers. Ronald Chang, a Coldwell Banker agent in Arcadia who moved here 
from Taiwan 12 years ago, specializes in marketing homes to other Asian 
immigrants. He has become particularly adept at finding houses that conform to 
his clients' wishes to have good fung shui, a Chinese superstition that 
dictates everything from the direction a house should face to its proximity to 
water. 
</P>
<P>
But Bob LeFever, president of Prudential California Realty's Orange and San 
Bernardino counties region, said these tactics still won't result in the amount 
of profit that brokerages made a year or two ago. "If anyone is telling you 
anything different, they're lying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that an industry consolidation is already under way. Jon 
Douglas, which has hired nearly half of Glickman's former agents and is 
negotiating to take over the leases at some or all of Glickman's former 
offices, recently acquired a small Manhattan Beach brokerage, Thomas &amp; 
Associates, as well. 
</P>
<P>
George Rathman, Prudential California's chairman, said in the past several 
months he has received several calls from other real estate companies 
interested in entering into joint ventures or selling out. Dana Potter, owner 
of Pinnacle Estate Properties in Northridge, said he too has received calls 
recently from three brokerages asking if he would be interested in acquiring 
them. Roger Hance, president of the R. R. Gable Inc. brokerage firm in 
Northridge, said he recently acquired a small Simi Valley brokerage and is 
mulling the purchase of two other firms. 
</P>
<P>
"It will basically be a game of who has the most wherewithal," Hance said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many in the industry believe that if the market continues to slow in 
the next several months, the dropout rate among agents will start to climb -- 
particularly among those who entered the business during the past few years 
when the market was booming. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of people jump on the bandwagon last year and they're all crying 
the blues right now," said Tara Conley, a Coldwell Banker agent in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But signs of a mass exodus aren't yet evident. Both the Los Angeles Board of 
Realtors and the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors say their ranks have not 
declined so far this year. That's partly because many "part-time" agents keep 
their licenses in weaker markets even though they might not be working. But it 
is also because many companies report that they're enlarging their agent work 
forces in order to keep sales volume up. 
</P>
<P>
Brokerages "need to keep their body count up to get those listings," said Erny 
Pickert Jr., president of Norton Realtors in Brentwood. Some offices are 
stacking three or four agents at a desk, Pickert said. These extra agents cost 
brokerages little in overhead, since most agents work as independent 
contractors and are paid only their share of commissions. 
</P>
<P>
But most agents say they're just working harder and spending more time with 
sellers, trying to persuade them to lower their prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an agent three years ago tell me how easy this business was," said 
Bobbie Ross of Jon Douglas' Beverly Hills office. "I've been in this business 
for 18 years, so I just smiled. I wonder if that agent is still working."

DOW TUMBLES 53.71 AS BUYERS 'BOYCOTT' THE MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
STOCKS: SOME ANALYSTS BLAME THE NEARLY 2% FALL ON NERVOUSNESS ABOUT INTEREST 
RATES AND CORPORATE PROFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought it was safe to get back into the stock market, the Dow 
Jones industrial index fell a whopping 53.71 points Monday, the biggest daily 
loss since January. The index closed at 2,882.18, down from Friday's record 
close of 2,935.89. 
</P>
<P>
Although market experts had many explanations for the decline, none could 
account for the size and scope of the nearly 2% drop in the key market 
indicator. 
</P>
<P>
There was some profit taking by investors who rode the market to record highs 
last week. There was some nervousness about interest rates and corporate 
profit. And there was some computer-driven program selling. But, mostly, there 
was little or no buying, according to market experts. 
</P>
<P>
"You had a buyers' boycott," said Jon Groveman, president of Ladenburg, Thalman 
&amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Selling was not heavy -- volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a scant 
133.47 million shares, compared to 205.13 million traded on Friday -- but 
virtually no big players stepped up to the plate to buy, Groveman noted. That 
translated to a slow day of steadily falling prices. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues led advancing issues by a 4-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
What it all means is equally uncertain. Some experts maintained that this was 
the beginning of a longer-term fall that will pull the Dow Jones index down 
another 10% to 20%. Others said it was a temporary setback in the market's 
nearly unrelenting march forward. 
</P>
<P>
Others admitted that they were unsure about the meaning of Monday's slide. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last six to eight weeks, we have had these periodic, one-day selloffs 
on light volume that have amounted to absolutely nothing," Groveman added. "We 
are just going to have to wait and see if the bulls gain control of the ball 
quickly or if we have a more sustained correction." 
</P>
<P>
A number of experts attributed part of Monday's fall to interest rates. Over 
the past several weeks, the stock market has benefited from a growing belief 
that the Federal Reserve would soon lower interest rates to spur the nation's 
flagging economy. But on Friday, the government released figures on industrial 
output indicating that the economy might be stronger than anticipated, which 
could cause the Fed to delay any cut in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investors are waiting to see what happens with corporate profit, 
which has been lackluster since late last year. The bulk of the nation's 
biggest companies will be reporting second-quarter and first-half results over 
the next four weeks. And those results will have a pivotal effect on how well 
stocks fare over the coming months, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
If profit is down, stocks may begin to look expensive, as measured by 
price/earnings ratios or dividend yields. Before Monday's selloff, stocks in 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-share index were selling for about 16.8 times 
earnings and dividend yields amounted to about 3.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"That does not make stocks grossly overvalued, but doesn't make them look cheap 
either," said Gerald Appel, publisher of Systems and Forecasts, a market 
newsletter published in Great Neck, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Program trading also played a role on Monday. About 45 points of the 53-point 
drop could be attributed to nine bouts of computer-driven selling, said Laszlo 
Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates in New York. That wasn't particularly 
unusual activity, Birinyi added, but its effect was magnified because there 
were so few buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every industry group was hard hit in Monday's selloff, including the 
market's recent favorites such as the technology sector. 
</P>
<P>
IBM closed down 1 5/8 at 118 3/4; Software Toolworks fell 4 7/8 to 19; Sun 
Microsystems lost 1 to close at 32 7/8; AST Research fell 1 1/2 to 22 1/4; 
Teradata dropped 1 1/8 to 26 5/8, and Compaq tumbled 4 3/8 to 123 5/8. 
</P>

CREDIT: Bond Prices Decline as Selloff Continues 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell in light trading as the market continued a selloff from last 
week sparked by concern that interest rates won't decline soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 13/32 point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, climbed to 8.46% from 
8.42% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was little economic news to affect bond trading, and the 
market followed its downward path from Friday, when the government issued a 
report showing industrial production rose at a greater-than-expected pace in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
The market interpreted the report to mean that it was unlikely the Federal 
Reserve would act to ease interest rates soon, since the report indicated that 
inflation may be rising. 
</P>
<P>
Falling interest rates can boost the value of fixed-return investments such as 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Takes Beating on Technical Factors 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against most other major currencies, buffeted by technical 
factors and expectations of lower U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar spent most of the day drifting downward in a continued response to 
last week's producer and consumer price reports. The data indicated weaker U.S. 
demand and heightened prospects for interest rate cuts, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
Traders believe that the Federal Reserve, which sets the nation's monetary 
policy, is more likely to nudge interest rates lower to stimulate the economy 
amid signs of a slowdown. Such a move would be bearish for the dollar, which is 
more attractive to investors when U.S. rates are higher.

COMMODITIES: Grain, Soybeans Up After 3-Day Slump 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures rallied on the Chicago Board of Trade, ending a 
three-day slide amid buying prompted in part by concerns about flood damage to 
corn and soybean crops. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, pork bellies extended their recent sharp losses 
while livestock futures were mixed; orange juice futures plunged again; copper 
futures rose, and precious metals were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures settled 2.50 cents lower to 2 cents higher in Chicago, with the 
contract for delivery in July at $3.30 a bushel; corn was 3.50 to 6.25 cents 
higher, with July at $2.865 a bushel; oats were 2.75 to 3.75 higher, with July 
at $1.4225 a bushel; soybeans were 2 to 11.75 cents higher, with July at $5.96 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the buying in the corn and soybean markets represented profit taking by 
traders who sold contracts last week, establishing "short positions," and 
bought them back Monday at lower prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Further buying after the mostly lower opening was prompted by reports that 
heavy weekend rains damaged newly planted corn and soybeans in low-lying areas 
of central Iowa, central Illinois and southern Ohio.

U.S. SUES 8 FIRMS FOR ALLEGEDLY POLLUTING SOUTHLAND COASTLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government on Monday sued eight companies -- including Westinghouse 
Electric, Chris-Craft Industries and Potlatch -- for inflicting damage to 
marine wildlife and its habitat off the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Chemicals released by the companies into the Los Angeles County sewer system -- 
in some cases, as long as 40 years ago -- ended up in coastal waters, the 
government alleged. The suits contend that the companies released the pesticide 
DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs, during the manufacturing process. 
Scientists say both chemicals are highly toxic and cause birth defects to birds 
and marine life. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sanitation districts have been notified that they may also 
be sued next April for damage to marine life for their alleged role in allowing 
pollutants into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Government biologists cited tests showing that fish caught off Los Angeles 
carry "high levels" of the pollutants and that California sea lions and 
bottlenose dolphins have the highest concentrations of the chemicals in their 
fatty tissue of any marine life the agency has seen. 
</P>
<P>
The case could have wide national implications. The government filed suit in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles under a little-used provision of the 1980 
Superfund act that requires certain federal and state agencies to act as 
trustees in pursuing damages from companies that have been accused of 
despoiling publicly owned natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the few times that government regulators have attempted not only 
to require polluters to clean up their mess but also to pay for restoring 
damaged wildlife and natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The lead agency in the suit is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, which is the trustee for federal marine resources. 
Co-plaintiffs are the Interior Department, trustee for the brown pelican and 
other birds, and three California state agencies, which have trustee 
responsibility for such resources as Harbor Lake, a DDT-polluted shoreline body 
of fresh water near the Los Angeles port. The case was filed by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Also named in the suits were Montrose Chemical Corp. of California, Stauffer 
Management Co., ICI American Holdings, Simpson Paper Co. and Atkemix 
Thirty-seven Inc. All eight companies currently operate, or once operated, in 
the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The government said tens of millions of dollars could be necessary to fund 
restoration efforts, including removal and treatment of underwater deposits of 
the pollutants, restocking of fish or the creation of artificial reefs. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of damaging chemicals in marine life raises the difficult question 
of how much animal life and its habitat is worth. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you assess the cost of such damage?" Karl S. Lytz, an attorney in the 
San Diego office of Latham &amp; Watkins, which is representing the Montrose 
Chemical Corp. of California, asked Monday. "We'll certainly be facing a lot of 
novel questions." 
</P>
<P>
"And I think there is potential for this type of law to be extremely 
inequitable," Lytz continued. He objected to "a very select number of 
companies" being held responsible for "a very broad spectrum" of pollution 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The sewer system served far more than just industrial dischargers," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies earlier named as possible lawsuit targets, including Benjamin 
Moore &amp; Co. and several small companies that clean 55-gallon drums for 
chemical storage, were dropped from the case because NOAA found insufficient 
evidence against them, government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"(NOAA) is frankly to be commended for not including us," said Charles C. Ivie, 
an attorney of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, representing Benjamin Moore. "They 
appeared to approach the matter in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists interviewed Monday were generally pleased to see the 
natural-resource damage provisions of the Superfund law put to use. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it is a turning point," said Sarah Chasis, a senior attorney with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council with long experience in coastal pollution 
issues. "Whether it starts a trend elsewhere in the country remains to be seen. 
But it certainly represents a shift from the total lack of action by the Reagan 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Late this summer or early fall, the agencies bringing suit against the 
companies accused of the marine pollution will issue their final 
damage-assessment plan. The plan will detail the methods to be used to survey 
the injuries to natural resources and to establish the cost of restoring them 
to normal condition. This will be in preparation for a settlement or a court 
trial sometime in the next few years.

Bankers Trust Cuts Finance Staff: The New York-based banking firm said it 
expects to save more than $10 million next year by cutting 75 of its more than 
700 corporate finance employees. The move is the latest sign of how brokerages 
and banking firms are cutting back on investment bankers and other personnel 
that handled the mergers and buyouts of the 1980s.

Supreme Court Will Review Texas Thrift Ruling: In a case affecting the 
government's efforts to deal with the S&amp;L crisis, the court agreed to 
decide whether federal regulators can be held liable for supervisory acts in 
running a troubled thrift. The court said it would hear a Justice Department 
appeal seeking to dismiss a lawsuit by Thomas Gaubert, former chairman of 
Independent American Savings Assn., a Texas thrift that was closed in 1987. He 
charged in the suit that the thrift's failure was caused by the negligence of 
regulators.

S&amp;P Cuts Occidental Petroleum Ratings: Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its 
ratings on Occidental Petroleum's debt, citing expectations of weak earnings 
and cash flow. The agency also cited high fixed costs of servicing total debt 
of about $8.2 billion, as well as a $2.50-a-share annual dividend that the 
agency called "very high." It reduced ratings on Oxy's senior debt and 
preferred stock to BBB-minus from BBB, subordinated debt to BB from BBB-minus, 
and commercial paper to A-3 from A-2.

CMS Energy Corp. said Monday that its Midland Cogeneration Venture power plant 
has been sold for $2.3 billion in what is believed to be the largest 
sale-leaseback deal in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Knopick, a CMS spokesman, said 65% of the plant -- built as a nuclear 
facility but later converted to a gas-fired cogeneration plant -- was bought by 
a group of major companies that did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 35% was bought by a CMS subsidiary, with the plant leased back to 
the original partnership that converted it into a gas-fired facility. The deal 
is for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The original partnership included CMS, Dow Chemical Co. and Michigan's largest 
utility, Consumers Power Co., a CMS subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership halted construction of the plant in 1984 after spending $4.2 
billion. It was 85% complete when the facility became mired in financing and 
regulatory wrangles.

MOTOROLA FACES SALES BAN ON MICROCHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorola faces an immediate ban on its ability to sell its most popular 
computer chip, the 68030 microprocessor, under a tentative ruling handed down 
late Monday in the acrimonious patent infringement lawsuits between the U.S. 
firm and Japan's Hitachi Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, U.S. District Judge Lucius D. Bunton in Austin, Tex., ordered 
Motorola to stop selling its flagship microprocessor as long as it infringed on 
Hitachi's patent. However, Bunton immediately stayed the effect of his ruling 
to allow for appeals. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bunton signaled his intention to lift the stay in a formal decision 
expected today. That would effectively prevent Motorola from selling the chip 
until the suits over the chip's patents are resolved. Analysts have said that 
Bunton, who has publicly reprimanded both parties for failing to settle their 
dispute out of court, has used his rulings to spur a speedier agreement over 
the conflicting patents. 
</P>
<P>
The 68030 microprocessor is the brains of many of Apple's Macintosh personal 
computers, as well as systems made by Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. An 
Apple spokesman said late Monday that it was too early to know how the latest 
development would affect its operations. Other companies could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although Motorola does not release sales figures for individual products, 
analysts have said that the 68030 is probably its largest single source of 
semiconductor revenue, contributing about $100 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
A Motorola spokesman said late Monday that the company intends to immediately 
appeal the latest decision and seek a new delay of its effect. "We are dismayed 
that Judge Bunton made this decision knowing full well that the two parties 
have been engaged in earnest attempts to settle this matter," the company said 
in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The legal wrangling started in January, 1989, when Motorola sued Hitachi, 
claiming that the Japanese company was using Motorola secrets in developing a 
series of chips. Hitachi countersued, claiming that Motorola infringed on some 
of its patents in the design for the 68030 microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
In his initial ruling in March, Bunton ruled that both parties had infringed on 
the other's patents and levied fines against both. Bunton also ordered the 
companies to stop selling the offending chips. Later he stayed the effect of 
the ruling.

PATHE SAYS TALKS TO BUY MGM ARE CONTINUING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Pathe Communications late Monday said it was "continuing discussions" about 
details of a plan under which Time Warner Inc. is to back Pathe's $1.2-billion 
bid for MGM/UA Communications Co., despite widespread reports that the talks 
had broken down. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills-based Pathe also confirmed earlier reports that it might extend a 
June 23 deadline by which it was supposed to conclude its $20-a-share tender 
offer for MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe shares fell 50 cents to $3.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, while 
MGM/UA shares dropped 37.5 cents to $18.25 amid persistent rumors that Time 
Warner was pulling out of a deal under which it is to provide $650 million of 
Pathe's financing. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still on," one top Warner executive said of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Another individual close to the discussions said: "We have something between a 
happy marriage and what you're hearing (about a breakdown in negotiations)." 
</P>
<P>
Pathe President Giancarlo Parretti has been struggling to conclude financing 
arrangements for the MGM/UA acquisition, which had been scheduled to close 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's statement, Pathe said a separate company owned by Pathe Chairman 
Florio Fiorini, Sasea Holding, had failed to conclude a sale of shares in Banca 
Agricola Milanese to Centro Nord Commissionaria, which was to have provided $52 
million in financing for the deal. But Sasea and another company owned by 
Parretti raised the financing by selling other securities, Pathe said.

For a couple years, the "dancing" California raisins seemed invincible, didn't 
they? Those rhythmic raisins ranked among the best-loved ads in the business. 
The raisins boogied across everything from pencils to pennants to pajama tops. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the raisin rage has all but dried up. Domestic raisin sales are off. 
And the campaign no longer even ranks among the nation's Top 10. "We can see 
the popularity of what they do has been waning," said Clyde Nef, manager of the 
Fresno-based California Raisin Advisory Board. "Things like Batman and the 
Ninja Turtles really jumped in as replacements." 
</P>
<P>
So what's a wrinkled raisin to do? That is the question that the California 
Raisin Advisory Board will ask itself this week. Should it banish the raisins 
to the advertising graveyard? Or is there a way to salvage the familiar image 
and use it in a fresh way?

Earlier this month, Isuzu announced that it was putting the slicked-back liar 
"Joe Isuzu" out to pasture. And one recent poll even suggests that the macho 
Marlboro Man is slipping noticeably in popularity. Eventually, the creators of 
all successful ad campaigns must ask themselves this agonizing question: When 
do you pull the plug on a popular campaign? 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to blow it by killing a campaign too soon," said Peter 
Stranger, president of the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS, 
the agency that created the "liar" campaign for American Isuzu Motor Co. nearly 
four years ago. "The only thing worse than that is keeping a campaign for too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Isuzu officials debated killing the "liar" campaign for nearly three 
years before making the fateful decision a few weeks ago. "Every year we looked 
at the campaign with and without Joe," said Stranger. Now, with plans to 
introduce three new vehicles in the fall, Isuzu officials decided that, while 
the Joe Isuzu character is great at getting people to remember the Isuzu name, 
he isn't so hot at selling product attributes. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Carpenter, the guy who invented Joe Isuzu, isn't at the agency anymore. 
But Carpenter, now senior creative director at the Los Angeles office of DDB 
Needham Worldwide, agrees that it was probably time for Joe to go. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of sad. A chapter is closing in advertising," said Carpenter, who 
got the idea for Isuzu while in a conference with two other agency executives. 
"But this has to happen to every great campaign." The real problem the car 
maker now faces is how to follow an act such as Joe Isuzu. "It's not easy to 
come up with a memorable hook that puts you in the Top 10," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, executives say, when the copywriter or artist who created a popular 
ad theme leaves an agency, there is no one left to really fight for it. At 
other times, the popularity alone of a commercial character is enough to keep 
it alive. For example, Gerald McGee, managing director of the Los Angeles 
office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, adapted the Pink Panther character for 
Owens-Corning Fiberglas more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he worked at Ogilvy's New York office. "I can't imagine someone 
coming to my door and telling me the panther has been painted out of the 
picture," he said. "I'd feel like a member of my family was taken away." 
</P>
<P>
About four years ago, American Express dropped its often-quoted campaign "Do 
you know me?" and replaced it with the current "Membership has its privileges." 
That, however, was a very tough decision for the client -- -- and the agency. 
"There was a feeling, borne out by research, that 'Do You Know Me?' wasn't 
doing as good a job as it had been," said Robert Neuman, senior vice president 
and creative director at Ogilvy &amp; Mather's New York office, which created 
both campaigns. "But it was obviously painful leaving it." 
</P>
<P>
Far less painful was the decision by Jack in the Box in 1980 to literally blow 
its familiar clown to smithereens in a TV commercial. "Blowing up the clown was 
a very clear symbol that things were changing at Jack in the Box," said Howard 
Cohen, chairman of the Los Angeles ad agency Cohen/Johnson, which continues to 
create ads for the fast-food chain. "When you're up against the McDonald's of 
the world, you have to do something different." 
</P>
<P>
Would Marlboro ever give the Marlboro Man the heave-ho? Not any time soon. But 
a snout-nosed camel with a goofy grin appears to have knocked him off his high 
horse. Camel's cartoon-like "Smooth Character" was the best remembered 
cigarette print ad campaign of 1989, according to a survey of 24,000 people by 
the New York research firm, Video Storyboard Tests. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 and 1984, Marlboro ranked as the No. 1 print ad campaign, according to 
Video Storyboard. By 1985, it had dropped to No. 3, and in 1989, it fell to No. 
5. A Philip Morris spokesman, Andrew White, said Marlboro won't drop the macho 
cowboy. "Marlboro's share of the market continues to grow," White said. "That's 
the only consumer survey that counts."

Ad Agencies Jumping Through NBA Hoops 
</P>
<P>
The National Basketball Assn. is playing hoops with several West Coast 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, NBA officials have had discussions with West Coast agencies 
about creating TV spots for the league when it switches from CBS to NBC next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"The project is being generated by our new network agreement with NBC," said 
Judy Shoemaker, vice president of marketing for the NBA. She said the NBA has 
interviewed agencies nationwide, even though the league is still undecided if 
it will hire any of them. She declined to name any of the West Coast agencies 
under consideration. But industry executives say the two Los Angeles agencies, 
Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates and Chiat/Day/Mojo, as well as San Francisco 
agency Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein, are all under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Said one top agency executive, "On an account like this, it's not the money 
that matters, it's the exposure. Imagine what you could do for a client like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mendelsohn/Zien Tunes in KABC Radio 
</P>
<P>
As radio stations increasingly advertise in other media, their ad business has 
become more coveted. Last week, Mendelsohn/Zien Advertising won one of the most 
sought-after radio accounts in Los Angeles: the $2-million KABC TalkRadio AM 
790 account. 
</P>
<P>
The win is a big one for the agency, which recently lost the $5-million Acura 
Advertising Assn. of Southern California business. Although Western 
International Media will continue to buy media time for the station, 
Mendelsohn/Zien will create ads and help devise a marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to bring a more consistent and concentrated marketing program to the 
station," said Richard Zien, president of the agency. The Shalek Agency 
formerly created ads for KABC. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KABC executives hope the advertising helps to boost ratings. "L.A. 
is probably the most competitive radio market in the country," said George 
Green, president and general manager of KABC. "Advertising can make a 
significant difference."Bonos in This 'Bo Knows' Spot? 
</P>
<P>
Bo knows Bo. That, at least, is the theme of the next Nike TV commercial 
starring the sports superstar. It will air next month during the Wimbledon 
tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In the commercial, Jackson -- who plays a number of roles -- keeps running into 
athletes who look like him. In fact, they are him. Among those he comes across 
are a surfboard-toting Bo, who greets him with, "Hey, dude." Then, there's the 
croquet-playing Bo who greets him with a distinctly British accent. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most unexpected appearance in the spot is by Sonny Bono, the 
former singer and mayor of Palm Springs. When Bo asks Bono what he's doing in 
the commercial, Bono replies, "I thought this was another 'Bo Knows' (Bonos) 
commercial."

Experts to Debate Advertising Morality 
</P>
<P>
How much advertising is hogwash? The answer depends on whom you ask. Next week, 
the advertising industry's chief spokesman will debate "Morality in 
Advertising" with the person some say could be the industry's most vociferous 
critic. 
</P>
<P>
At the Beverly Hilton Hotel, at noon on June 27, the Advertising Club of Los 
Angeles will sponsor a debate between John O'Toole, president of the American 
Assn. of Advertising Agencies, and Bruce Silverglade, legal affairs director of 
the Washington-based lobby, Center for Science in the Public Interest. The 
debate, which will be broadcast on KABC TalkRadio, will also be moderated by 
on-air personality Michael Jackson.

Officials of Chrysler Corp. and Italy's Fiat SpA are in intensive negotiations 
that could result in a major deal between the two companies, industry analysts 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Such a deal could be relatively routine, such as a joint development project, 
or it could involve one of the auto makers buying a stake in the other. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that they're talking to one another," said Shearson Lehman 
Hutton analyst Joe Phillippi. 
</P>
<P>
Phillippi, who said he has heard rumors that Fiat could seek as much as 25% of 
Chrysler with an option to buy 51%, said a pact between them would make sense. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Fiat nor Chrysler would comment on the speculation.

GRADCO SYSTEMS INC. REPORTS $28.6-MILLION QUARTERLY LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gradco Systems Inc., battered by the loss of its largest customer, reported a 
$28.6-million loss for the fourth quarter ended March 31. It also said a group 
of Japanese investors had agreed to buy a 27% stake in its pivotal Japanese 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based manufacturer of sorters for copying machines and printers also 
disclosed that it had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Xerox Corp., 
which with its two foreign affiliates had accounted for more than a third of 
Gradco's business. Xerox now manufactures its own sorters. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco's poor fourth-quarter performance resulted in a $28.1-million loss on 
revenue of $89.5 million for the fiscal year, contrasted with $5.6 million in 
net earnings on revenue of $115.1 million in the previous year. The loss was 
due largely to a one-time, $23-million fourth-quarter charge from a major 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization, which followed a failed effort by Gradco Chairman Keith 
Stewart to take the company private in a leveraged buyout, resulted in the 
shutdown of a Santa Ana manufacturing facility and the transfer of all 
responsibility for copier products -- which account for 70% of the company's 
business -- to Gradco Japan. Gradco said the $26.5-million investment in Gradco 
Japan would come from a group of Japanese institutional investors led by Japan 
Associated Finance Co. (JAFCO). 
</P>
<P>
Stewart called the deal "another step in the process of taking Gradco Japan 
public on the Japanese over-the-counter market."

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP SEEKS BAN ON A COMMON CHEMICAL

<P>
An environmental group called on the Bush Administration Monday to participate 
in an international effort to phase out a commonly used chemical that is 
depleting the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
The Natural Resources Defense Council also urged consumers to avoid buying 141 
products, ranging from artists' varnishes to hornet-killing sprays, that 
contain the chemical 1,1,1-trichloroethane. 
</P>
<P>
Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, have been singled out as the most potent 
ozone-destroying substances. But the council said 1,1,1, as it is known for 
short, is responsible for a large share of ozone depletion because it is 
produced in such large quantities. 
</P>
<P>
About 724 million pounds of 1,1,1 were produced in 1988 by DOW Chemical, PPG 
Industries, and Vulcan Chemical, according to the NRDC. 
</P>
<P>
The group said 90% of the chemical is used in industrial solvents. Consumer 
goods that contain it include Scotchgard fabric protectors manufactured by 
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing of St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
"For most applications, there are alternative products on the market that serve 
the same purpose" both in industry and individual homes, the NRDC said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 70 nations will open a 10-day meeting in London on Wednesday 
to consider revisions to an international agreement that freezes production and 
consumption of CFCs at their 1986 level. The pact, known as the Montreal 
Protocol, also calls for a 50% reduction in CFCs by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
"The most difficult decisions remaining relate to 1,1,1-trichloroethane," said 
David D. Doniger, director of the NRDC's ozone protection project. He said 
options under consideration range from a 25% rollback to a complete phase-out 
in the next 10 years.

DANCE THEATRE OF HARLEM ON FIRMER FOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: AMERICAN EXPRESS MAKES COMMITMENT IN CASH AND MARKETING.

<P>
As the Dance Theatre of Harlem approaches the midpoint of a six-month layoff, 
it received some good news that points toward renewed activity and sounder 
financial footing for the company, which was forced to suspend operations 
earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
American Express Travel Related Services Co. is making a major commitment of 
both cash and marketing services to the company, American Express president and 
CEO Edwin Cooperman announced at a press conference Monday. He described a 
"unique alliance" between his corporation and the company -- a four-year 
commitment that will involve a $1 million cash contribution and an in-kind 
contribution of at least $250,000 in marketing expertise. 
</P>
<P>
"We will also approach our partners in the business community to help us 
sponsor DTH as they tour around the country and around the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Mitchell, the company's artistic director, accepted an oversized check 
representing the first of four $250,000 installments. 
</P>
<P>
The company's 54 dancers, along with some technical and administrative staff, 
were laid off at the end of March, following a highly successful national tour, 
as the company faced a $1.7-million deficit. Mitchell said the dancers and 
staff would return to work Oct. 1, at the start of the company's fiscal year, 
and that they would regroup slowly following the layoff. "We have been through 
the fire, and we have survived to become even stronger and with our sense of 
commitment more firmly resolved than ever," Mitchell stated. His goal is to 
establish a $2-million cash reserve for DTH, as part of his stated intention to 
demonstrate fiscal responsibility. Noting the financial pressures faced by a 
growing number of dance troupes nowadays, he observed that "companies cannot 
continue on the way they have in the past. We need to think more like the 
business community, in terms of insurance." 
</P>
<P>
The American Express contribution follows a recent $1 million emergency grant 
to the company from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The company may perform in Boston in November, but will not begin full-scale 
touring until 1991.

GERSTLER PREMIERE ON FINAL GENERATOR EIGHT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Context is everything -- at least that seems to sum up the final Generator 
Eight program Sunday, concluding the dance festival at the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, how could a piece that had previously smacked of a crank-'em-out 
mentality -- Sarah Elgart's "Sleepless" -- suddenly become the heavyweight of 
this evening? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: by not being placed on the same bill with its look-alikes and by 
landing alongside several very thin, very improvisatory items. 
</P>
<P>
The touted premiere of the program, Tina Gerstler's "Onomatopoeia," boasted 
neither cleverness, nor craftsmanship, nor depth, nor wit, and gave away its 
terminal cuteness at the outset: Five women stroll onstage, warm up as for a 
class and chat with a trio of musicians already in position. 
</P>
<P>
Then, against what is basically a conga solo, courtesy of Brad Dutz, the 
dancers go through their paces -- sprinting, flinging, rolling and sliding -- 
in what now seems the accepted vocabulary of postmodern dance. Appropriating a 
language without addressing syntax or meaning, however, does not bode well. 
</P>
<P>
And in trying to puzzle out the value of Gerstler's contribution -- after all, 
LATC does provide a superior stage opportunity where audiences expect full 
professionalism -- this viewer could find none. 
</P>
<P>
As for her choice of title, well, it was consistently lame. There were nominal 
attempts at representing the instrumental sounds with apt movements -- a gourd 
glissando, for instance, elicited a ratchety motion. A program note offered, by 
way of supposed explanation, the following: "sizzle, slither, sputter, slam, 
pant, drag, patter, zig-zag, barf, whine." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, "Sleepless" had elements of interest. With its pajama-clad dancers 
cavorting in a densely wild nightmare against the cosmic musings of narrator 
Brian Brophy, at least there was an idea to grab onto. 
</P>
<P>
The agenda also included tapper Fred Strickler and Shok-T's "Inverted 
Carnival." DONNA PERLMUTTER

EREVAN CHORAL SOCIETY IN PASADENA PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The local Armenian community is one of the most cohesive and culturally active 
of the Southland's ethnic groups. That was evident Sunday at Pasadena City 
College, where the Erevan Choral Society and Symphony Orchestra of Greater 
Boston presented a program that was reportedly sold out two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Listeners remained enthusiastic throughout the program, and few seemed to tire 
from the long evening. Although most audience members were seated by 7 p.m. 
(the announced starting time), the proceedings did not get under way until 35 
minutes later. And with speeches before, after and during the program, with two 
encores and a 30-minute intermission, it was 11 before the musicians finally 
left the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The program consisted of 30 songs, at best count, about half of them 
nationalistic songs, half of them Armenian popular songs. The Choral Society 
delivered most of the former; these they sang with vibrancy, rhythmic precision 
and clear enunciation. 
</P>
<P>
Founder/director Father Oshagan Minassian and Melik Mavisakalian (from Armenia) 
alternated the conducting duties; both elicited expressive, energized singing. 
</P>
<P>
During the pre-intermission segment, contralto Raissa Megerdichian brought 
style and passion to a number of popular selections (usually the choruses 
backed her up with wordless syllables), that sounded like an amalgam of 
American pop and traditional Armenian music. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, tenor Rouben Matevossian delivered several more such songs 
with resonance, power and considerable feeling, although his hand gestures 
looked artificial. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestral arrangements were slick but undeniably effective and the 
orchestra, which traveled from Boston with the choristers (a few local 
free-lancers thrown in), proved first-rate. TERRY McQUILKIN

LOS ANGELES EMIGRE ORCHESTRA AT EBELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Emigre Virtuoso Orchestra is more emigre than virtuoso, as 
Sunday night's hodgepodge program in Wilshire Ebell Theatre amply demonstrated. 
Still, under the no-nonsense guidance of music director Armen Garabedian, it's 
a solid ensemble capable of making its musical points when given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there wasn't much of a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Soloists dominated the evening. Violinist Daniel Shindaryov offered the Violin 
Concerto No. 4 by Paganini, a work that has little to do with music, more to do 
with empty virtuosic display. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shindaryov handled much of its finger-twisting, bow-bending 
technicalities with impressive dexterity, there were enough rough edges to 
suggest that he (and we) might have been better off with a different piece. His 
cool approach proved welcome in the music's sentimental moments, yet overall it 
made for uninvolving listening. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Khachik Kyurkchian, despite the occasional stumble, brought surprising 
bravura, decisive accents and impetuosity to Chopin's E-minor Concerto; he also 
knew how to give lyrical passages strong direction and spontaneity. The 
orchestra accompanied dutifully and sloppily in the Paganini, with greater 
attentiveness and warmth in Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
Garabedian began the concert with Beethoven's "Egmont" Overture in a clean but 
overemphatic and constricted reading; he concluded with the romping vulgarities 
of Khatchaturian's "Sabre Dance," fleetly and pointedly played.TIMOTHY MANGAN

GRANTS: What protest? Santa Ana's Pacific Chorale is the latest local arts 
group to accept grants from the embattled National Endowment for the Arts. 
After signing a controversial anti-obscenity pledge, the chorale will receive 
$11,500. . . . The pledge isn't really applicable, said chorale executive

<P>
The Presidio looks more like a park than a military base, with towering 
eucalyptus and cypress trees shading lush lawns and creeks winding through 
1,800 hilly acres above the Golden Gate Bridge and the Pacific Ocean. In fact, 
it soon will be a park: The Army plans to move out in 1995 and turn over the 
nation's oldest fort to the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, beneath the Presidio's greenery lie the products of decades of spills, 
leaks and ill-planned dumping of poisonous chemicals. An estimated 200 fuel 
tanks, many thought to be leaking, are buried at the base. There are three 
known sites of PCB spills as well as several uncharted landfills, their 
contents unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The Presidio is emblematic of the government's legacy at hundreds of federal 
facilities across the country, from Energy Department nuclear weapons 
laboratories and assembly plants to abandoned mines on Department of Interior 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Sam, who is supposed to enforce the environmental laws, is the country's 
worst polluter. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't understand their taxpayer dollars being used to create 
pollution," said Rep. Dennis E. Eckart (D-Ohio). "You have to end the federal 
government's attitude of 'do as I say, not as I do.' " 
</P>
<P>
The price of cleaning up toxic wastes at federal facilities nationwide -- 
perhaps a 30-year task -- has been estimated at between $140 billion and $200 
billion by the White House budget office. The Presidio cleanup alone is 
expected to cost $10 million to $80 million. At California's heavily 
industrialized military shipyards, air bases and weapons depots, the cleanup 
bill may climb into the billions. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the Pentagon studying closure of more than 120 domestic bases, 
pressure is building to speed investigations of the military's toxic problems 
and correct them before the facilities are transferred to civilian use. The 
trick will be finding the cash to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a problem of major proportions that has not been faced," said Rep. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), whose district includes the Presidio. "We have to 
clean up our mess and we have to do it before we close these bases." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are the numbers worse than in California. The Environmental Protection 
Agency's list of Superfund sites includes 17 Defense Department or Energy 
Department installations in California -- more than in any other state. Among 
them: the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, which made the list in February. 
</P>
<P>
The Superfund, a federal program set up in 1980 to pay for cleaning up the most 
dangerous hazardous-waste sites, identifies places that represent the greatest 
risk to public health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
By September, EPA officials hope to decide whether to propose adding the 
Presidio and 23 other federal installations in California to the Superfund 
sites. A further 154 federal facilities in the state must produce detailed 
reports on their toxic problems. The reports will be reviewed as the first step 
toward determining whether the facilities should be on the Superfund list. 
</P>
<P>
Wastes present at these facilities run from radium (a radioactive substance 
used for illuminated dials) to solvents, pesticides, coolants, paint scrapings 
and old fuel. Waste from these bases has flowed into waterways, settled into 
ground water and drifted into drinking water wells. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much left to be done before we have a complete picture of the 
contamination," said Julie K. Anderson, of the EPA's western regional 
headquarters in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Tests at El Toro have shown that a carcinogenic grease-cutting agent has seeped 
into ground water. So far, the contamination has not been found in wells used 
for public drinking water. But the Orange County Water District has discovered 
a narrow stream of ground water 3 1/2 miles long stretching from the base to a 
point between Jeffrey Road and Culver Drive in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state officials will begin a two-year study in November to 
determine the extent of the problem at El Toro and devise a cleanup plan. 
Besides the grease solvent, early studies have uncovered evidence of jet fuel 
and paint thinners dumped in several pits at the base. 
</P>
<P>
Although private corporations spent much of the 1980s trying to clean the nests 
they had fouled, the military only now is coming to terms with decades of 
environmental abuses and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
The delay is due in part to the Defense Department's long-standing insistence 
that it was not subject to EPA regulation. That position changed in 1986 when 
Congress, over the Ronald Reagan Administration's objections, decided that 
contamination from military sources was, indeed, the EPA's business. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon lost that fight but continues to oppose congressional efforts to 
give state regulators the authority to impose fines and penalties on federal 
agencies that violate environmental laws. Pentagon officials argue that giving 
the states such power would inject politics into highly technical decisions and 
skew cleanup priorities toward those states with aggressive, publicity-seeking 
attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
As the severity of the problem becomes more and more apparent, the Pentagon 
lately has made some concessions to California. The Defense Department recently 
agreed to pay the state Department of Health Services to monitor military 
anti-pollution efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The fee will be only 1% of the cost of cleaning up the military installations, 
but the dollar amount could be large. The cost of removing toxics from 11 
Northern California naval bases alone will be $702.8 million, according to the 
Naval Facilities Engineering Command in San Bruno. That estimate could be 
"low," Randal A. Friedman, who is coordinator of cleanup efforts at Navy bases 
in the Bay Area, warned. 
</P>
<P>
Cleaning up Hunters Point naval shipyard, a Superfund site in San Francisco, 
will cost $94 million. At Moffett Naval Air Station in Mountain View, also on 
the Superfund list, the job is expected to cost $113 million. 
</P>
<P>
At McClellan Air Force Base outside Sacramento, officials have detected in 
ground water the solvent trichloroethylene (TCE), a suspected carcinogen, in 
concentrations up to 13,000 times the maximum safe level. The Air Force expects 
that cleanup bill to reach $100 million by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
TCE has also seeped into ground water below Norton Air Force Base at San 
Bernardino, one of the bases being considered for closure. "The question is not 
whether (TCE) will pollute additional wells but how long will it take for it to 
get there," said Lt. Mark Wright, chief of environmental planning at Norton. 
The Norton cleanup is expected to cost $44 million or more and take decades. 
</P>
<P>
State toxic waste regulators doubt that any of the military bases in California 
conceals an environmental horror story on the order of Love Canal or the 
Stringfellow Acid Pits, but officials have discovered that finding and fixing 
contamination at a military installation is more complex than at most private 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bases) are basically like small cities. They handle everything. They have 
sewer systems. They have underground tanks. They have landfills," said Donald 
Dawlke, chief of the toxic cleanup division the San Francisco Bay Regional 
Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
There are also more types of pollutants. While a company may pollute ground 
water with pesticides, PCBs or solvents, military bases used, slopped and 
dumped the whole spectrum of all-too-familiar toxins along with other, more 
exotic poisons. 
</P>
<P>
At Hunters Point, for example, asbestos, heavy metals, radioactive radium dials 
and sand and paint chips from the sandblasted hulls of ships were dumped to 
fill in 20 acres of tidal lands in San Francisco Bay, in the next cove over 
from Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy left Hunters Point in the mid-1970s and contracted out its ship repair 
business to a local company, Triple A Machine Shop Inc. The San Francisco 
district attorney is prosecuting Triple A on 16 felony counts of illegal 
dumping at Hunters Point. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Navy is back, embarking on an ambitious plan to clean the base. But 
Friedman, the coordinator of the naval cleanup in the Bay Area, said that EPA 
cleanup procedures are cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of study you have to do is incredible," Friedman said. "The process 
is inherently slanted to the conservative side. You don't want to remove 15 
feet of dirt and find out a few years later you should have removed 20 feet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Atomic Fallout Waste 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boxer has called on the EPA to investigate what may be a byproduct 
of the problems left by Hunters Point. In the years after World War II, ships 
contaminated by fallout from atomic tests in the Bikini Atoll were cleaned at 
Hunters Point. 
</P>
<P>
Each year in the 1950s, sandblast waste, paint chips and other radioactive 
trash were encased in concrete-lined drums, shipped 50 miles off San Francisco 
on barges and dumped into the ocean near the Farallon Islands. Now, the drums 
are feared to be leaking into what has been a rich fishery. 
</P>
<P>
Military waste is not confined to federal bases and dumps. Over the years, the 
Defense Reutilization and Marketing Services has sold old chemicals as surplus. 
In several instances, chemicals bought for a few cents on the dollar have come 
to haunt local officials. 
</P>
<P>
At a congressional hearing earlier this year in Sacramento, Los Angeles 
officials told of their continuing efforts to reclaim port-owned land in 
Wilmington where a local businessman stored 40,000 gallons of stale solvents, 
paints, batteries and decontaminants used on chemical warfare components. Some 
of the materials were sold by the El Toro Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
David McKenna, a deputy Los Angeles city attorney, estimated that the city has 
already spent $650,000 on the Wilmington cleanup. If the chemicals seep into 
ground water, the cost could exceed $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Solano County is prosecuting a man who bought 35,000 gallons of highly 
poisonous and explosive chemicals at military auctions, starting in 1976, in 
the hope of reselling them. They were stored in a barn near Collinsville, on 
the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals, discovered last year, came from nearby military installations. 
The cost of cleaning up the site topped $1 million, Solano County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Mark Pollock said. 
</P>
<P>
California has sued to force compliance with state laws in the handling of 
toxic substances at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, near Vallejo, and at Ft. 
Ord, near Monterey. But courts have ruled that the state cannot collect money 
from federal facilities that mishandle toxics. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the state Department of Health Services has the authority to inspect 
federal bases and issue citations. Health officials have found that some 
military officials still have not learned any lesson from the past. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of actions that ended in March, the state Department of Health 
Services cited Mare Island Naval Shipyard, a submarine repair base at the 
northeastern tip of San Francisco Bay, for sloppy handling of wastes. 
</P>
<P>
State inspectors found 13 violations. Two concrete tanks holding 525,000 
gallons of toxins were leaking. A barge held 20,000 gallons of waste oil. If 
the drums ruptured, there was nothing to keep the waste from flowing into San 
Francisco Bay. Perhaps most troubling was that the tanks had been in place 
without proper permits for 13 years and may have been leaking all the while. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Base Closures 
</P>
<P>
As the Defense Department studies closing 121 bases around the country, the 
issue of toxics at military bases will loom ever larger. And, if the past is a 
guide, the cost of decontamination will be dear. 
</P>
<P>
In the Marin County town of Novato, two developers in 1985 agreed to pay $45 
million for 400 acres at Hamilton Field, used over the years by the Navy, Air 
Force and Army. But escrow has not yet closed because a 26-acre toxic dump at 
the center of the 400 acres has not been cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Boxer said, those 26 acres most likely will have to be fenced off 
and abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The news that Moffett Naval Air Station, in Silicon Valley, might be closed was 
cheered not only by peace activists (who said it could prove that closing a 
base could benefit the local economy), but by developers also. They saw the 
land reborn as a meticulously planned community with trails fronting San 
Francisco Bay, reclaimed wetlands, a space museum and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
But toxins buried at Moffett threaten to delay any such conversion. The Navy's 
preliminary assessment is that wastes probably have leaked into the ground from 
unlined holding ponds and cracked fuel tanks. Several landfills also contain 
hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Moffett's fences is another Superfund site, one polluted by 
semiconductor manufacturers. These companies say that efforts to clean the 
plume of contaminated ground water have been stalled, first by Navy reluctance 
to acknowledge that it contributed to the problem and now by the Navy's lengthy 
study process. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to start (the cleanup) right now," said Charles Bostic of 
Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. Until Moffett identifies its pollution sources, 
however -- a process that may take two or three years longer -- the companies 
will not begin a cleanup for fear of aggravating a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the bases being considered for closure, none holds more promise than the 
Presidio. Most of the complex will be left as a park. It is unclear what will 
become of the grand officers' quarters, golf course and tennis courts, but 
among the suggestions is one that part of the grounds be leased to a 
university. 
</P>
<P>
The military museum probably will remain and perhaps be expanded. The Presidio 
was first held by the Spanish in 1776, then by Mexico and, finally, by the U.S. 
Army. As the oldest military base in continuous operation in the United States, 
much of its history is clouded and details of its waste problem are not known. 
For example: There are three Nike missile silos on the base, but their contents 
are unknown. The doors are welded shut. 
</P>
<P>
Although transforming the garrison into a park is "the chance of a lifetime," 
said Brian O'Neill, director of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and 
the official in charge of planning the Presidio's future, the Army must first 
clean it up. He said the issue is "at the top" of his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presidio Time Bombs 
</P>
<P>
Studies conducted at the Presidio last year by Argonne National Laboratory and 
the Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency found "no imminent or substantial 
threat to human life or the environment." 
</P>
<P>
But the reports went on to say there are more than 200 underground fuel and 
storage tanks at the base, that the locations and contents of many of them are 
not known "with any reliability," and that some of them probably are leaking. 
</P>
<P>
Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), a suspected carcinogen used widely to cool 
electrical transformers, was spilled in at least three spots, and soldiers 
dumped trash at some landfills not yet identified. A 1984 Army study found TCE 
and other chemicals suspected of causing cancer or congenital defects in ground 
water beneath the Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
The worst known contamination is at and near Crissy Field, where San Francisco 
holds its Fourth of July celebrations. The Argonne report predicted that toxins 
under the old landing strip will not reach the drinking water supply, but it 
warned that the "ultimate discharge point of this ground water is San Francisco 
Bay, and marine organisms are thus threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Saul Bloom of the Arms Control Research Center, a private group that advocates 
converting military facilities to civilian use, said of the Presidio: "We might 
have the first national park listed on Superfund."

U.S. WILL RELAX MOST HIGH-TECH EXPORT CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration announced Monday that it plans to end Cold War-era 
requirements that U.S. firms obtain export licenses on most of the 
high-technology goods that they ship to other Western countries -- a move that 
will affect about $30 billion worth of trade. 
</P>
<P>
The order, which will become effective in two weeks, is the first formal step 
that the Administration has taken to ease export-licensing requirements on U.S. 
trade with the Western allies, a relaxation that American business has sought 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County high-tech companies expect to profit from the new rule. Last 
year, the county applied for 3,293 export licenses valued at $6.2 billion, the 
highest percentage jump in value of export license applications in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials said the deregulation primarily will affect three 
major categories of exports -- computers, semiconductor-manufacturing equipment 
and telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export administration, said the 
elimination of requirements for export licenses will ease the administrative 
burden for U.S. firms and make them more competitive within the Western 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, partly to help ensure that buyers do not re-export the strategic 
technology they receive, the regulations require U.S. exporters to keep on file 
basic information about the firm that is purchasing their products. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, initial reaction from the business community was lukewarm. William 
T. Archey, international vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said 
that the easing is welcome but that it is "tempered" by the requirement for 
added data. He branded the action "an interim step." 
</P>
<P>
The move was taken on the heels of a June 7 agreement by the United States and 
its major allies on a sweeping overhaul of Western restrictions on 
high-technology exports to the Soviet Bloc, expected to ease the way for sales 
of goods needed to modernize Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Congress also is moving to force the Administration to liberalize its rules. 
The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act ordered the White House to streamline previous 
rules. And a new bill by Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) would eliminate all such 
licensing requirements by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
However, Administration policy-makers said the process was speeded up by the 
allies' accord on East-West trade and by the faster-than-expected movement 
within the European Community to create a single, integrated European market by 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States had not relaxed its restrictions on exports to other 
Western allies, it could have left American producers facing a two-tiered 
export-control process in which U.S. firms were put at a visible disadvantage 
against European firms in their product lines. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the United States must next make sure that its own 
regulations are consistent with those of other Western countries so that the 
allies can adopt common security standards for high-tech exports by next April 
30, as promised. 
</P>
<P>
The relaxation announced Monday will have no impact on current requirements 
that firms obtain licenses when the products they are selling to a Western 
country are to be re-exported to a former Soviet Bloc nation. In such 
instances, previous rules remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they probably will have to draft special procedures for 
technology and equipment that is destined for East Germany -- particularly if 
that country's scheduled reunification with West Germany is accelerated, as 
seems more and more likely. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials estimated that the relaxation announced Monday 
would eliminate the need for about 20,000 of the 25,000 licenses that the 
agency issued in 1989 for exports to Western countries, including 90% of those 
for semiconductor-manufacturing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
William P. Conlin, president of Anaheim-based Calcomp Inc., which makes 
computer graphic display equipment, said the Bush decision can make U.S. 
high-tech companies more competitive in the international market. 
</P>
<P>
Calcomp, which exported 60% of its total sales of $450 million last year, 
expects the new regulation to make it easier for the company to sell in Western 
Europe. It normally takes two to six weeks to obtain an export license approval 
from the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Advanced Logic Research, an Irvine-based personal computer maker, 
also were pleased with the move. About 30% of ALR's annual sales are sold in 
the international market, most of which go to Western Europe. Last year, it 
applied in excess of 50 export licenses. 
</P>
<P>
"With the elimination of the need for most computer licensing, we can be more 
responsive to our customers in Europe," said Dave Kirkey, vice president of 
sales and marketing for Advanced Logic Research Inc. in Irvine.

POLICE-INS TIES URGED IN SANTA ANA 
</P>

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blaming an influx of illegal aliens for some of Santa Ana's worst urban 
problems, a citizens advisory group Monday called for police officials to "gain 
control over the expanding illegal immigrant population in the city" by working 
closer with federal immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations by the Mayor's Task Force on Neighborhood Standards and 
Preservation comes at a time when other Orange County cities -- most notably 
Costa Mesa -- are deploying a variety of sometimes controversial regulations to 
discourage illegal aliens from taking up residence. 
</P>
<P>
Latino rights advocates were immediately critical of officials in Santa Ana, 
where more than half the city's 235,000 residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"This report seems to be directed not only at undocumented workers but at 
people who are different in general," said Rebecca Jurado, an attorney with the 
American Civil Liberties Union. "This is so ironic, especially since the city 
has such a large number of Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to the City Council, the 16-member mayor's task force 
addressed what it considered the city's five most critical "issues of concern 
for the 1990s": neighborhood overcrowding, the impact of the 
non-English-speaking immigrant population, crime and gang activity, traffic 
congestion and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
But the group's comments about illegal aliens triggered the most controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the size of the illegal immigrant population contributes significantly 
to overcrowding in the schools and creates a severe negative impact on the 
school system," the report states, "more effective management and enforcement 
of immigration policies and regulations is critical to providing a competitive 
educational opportunity for all students in Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
The task force report suggested that the city should work "through its schools, 
social, ethnic organizations and religious institutions . . . to educate 
immigrants to promote cultural harmony. The rights of U.S. citizens and legal 
immigrants must be protected. 
</P>
<P>
"However, it is the recommendation of the Task Force that the Santa Ana Police 
Department increase its cooperation with the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service to enforce existing laws and reduce the disproportionate number of 
undocumented people settling in the Santa Ana area. This will provide the 
community an opportunity to 'catch up with itself' in helping new, legal 
residents assimilate." 
</P>
<P>
Nativo V. Lopez, director of the Latino rights group Hermandad Mexicana 
Nacional, described the recommendations as "a nice way of saying 'conduct raids 
to reduce the number of immigrants in Santa Ana.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," Lopez predicted, "this is going to lead to polarization of the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young said the report's recommendation that police work more 
closely with INS agents was only intended to impact illegal aliens who commit 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about people who are breaking the law," Young said. "Why should 
somebody be released if they are illegal here and are criminals? We have every 
right to have that person removed from Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has always been sensitive to the Latino community. We want to respect 
the rights of thoses who are here legally." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Paul M. Walters said his department already cooperates with the 
INS when it arrests an illegal alien who has committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Walters said the department has an ongoing policy of not cooperating with INS 
agents who periodically conduct sweeps through the city in search of 
undocumented residents. Former Santa Ana Police Chief Ray Davis initiated that 
policy in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Walter said the department will stand by that policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do something like that (conduct sweeps)," Walters said. "We don't 
have that kind of ability." 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights lawyer Jurado noted that Santa Ana police also lack the authority 
to enforce federal immigration laws and that they cannot determine whether a 
person is illegal or not. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman John Acosta said the task force's report "stops short of being 
racist." But Acosta said he is concerned that the group's membership does not 
reflect Santa Ana's population. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that we didn't get a good cross-section of the city. There's no 
Asians and very little Hispanics," Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the task force's 16 members is Latino, one member said.

<P>
The Orange County Transit District on Monday approved a budget of $184.4 
million that includes the addition of 110 positions. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the positions are for bus drivers and maintenance workers being 
added to keep pace with the increase in ridership, which has gone up 40% in the 
last 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The OCTD board recently approved the purchase of 39 buses. 
</P>
<P>
The budget, for the 1990-91 fiscal year, also includes $31.6 million to design 
and purchase land for the Santa Ana Freeway transitway, a network of car-pool 
lanes separated by barriers from the other lanes. Construction on the 
transitway, which will stretch from the interchange with the Orange and Garden 
Grove freeways to the Costa Mesa Freeway, could begin as early as next 
year.SHANNON SANDS

CONVICTION UPHELD IN FATAL BOAT CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appellate court on Monday upheld the involuntary manslaughter conviction of 
Virl Earles, the boat driver who crashed into a concrete buoy in Anaheim Bay 
six years ago, killing five of his eight passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Earles, now 34, has been free from custody during his appeal. He will now be 
ordered to return to court to begin the three-year sentence handed him by 
Superior Court Judge Jean H. Rheinheimer. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. of the 4th District Court of Appeal, who wrote the 
unanimous decision made public Friday, noted that none of the passengers aboard 
the Whiskey Runner were wearing life jackets, which should have caused Earles 
to be particularly cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"The vulnerability of his passengers reflected poorly on his decision to travel 
at such a high speed in a dark harbor," Crosby wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby added that Earles drove the boat "far too fast" and showed "an 
indifference to the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Earles and several friends had been drinking at a restaurant at Peter's Landing 
near Seal Beach on Oct. 28, 1984. They were joined by several others, and the 
group -- nine in all -- decided to travel by boat just after midnight to view 
the Queen Mary in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On the return trip, Earles re-entered Anaheim Bay at a high rate of speed. 
Misjudging the location of the safe-boating channel, he rammed the 20-foot 
craft into a concrete mooring buoy. Earles and three others were injured. Two 
in the group died of injuries received when thrown into the buoy. Three others 
drowned. 
</P>
<P>
Earles, a part-time boat worker from Westminster, testified at two trials that 
a missing marker light in the bay caused him to stray off course. Later, a 
federal judge ordered the U.S. Navy to pay a total of $2.3 million to the 
families of the victims on the grounds that it should have had better markers 
in the channel. But that finding did not exonerate Earles. 
</P>
<P>
A first jury was hung 9 to 3 in favor of acquitting him. But he was found 
guilty by a new jury in a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors alleged that Earles was grossly negligent on numerous grounds: He 
had been drinking and would have been legally drunk if driving a car instead of 
a boat; he drove between 25 and 30 m.p.h. when the posted speed limit in the 
bay was 5 m.p.h., and the boat was overloaded and did not have an adequate 
number of life jackets. JERRY HICKS

GIRL BADLY HURT IN FALL FROM 2ND STORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 3-year-old girl was in serious condition Monday evening after she tumbled out 
a second-floor bedroom window onto an asphalt alley. 
</P>
<P>
The child, Diedre Anderson, had been playing with her two sisters in the rear 
bedroom of their apartment at 1449 E. Grove Ave. in Orange, when she apparently 
climbed on a bookshelf under the window, pulled open the window and pushed the 
screen, her mother Mindy Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I let them look out the window, but always with the window closed," Anderson 
said at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana. "It wasn't locked, but she had 
never opened it before -- she didn't get into things; she wasn't a digger kid." 
</P>
<P>
The child suffered from blunt chest trauma and a fractured skull, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. "It still boggles my mind," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of the apartment complex said that he was moving his trailer when he 
turned and saw the child falling. 
</P>
<P>
"At first she was out cold and then she started crying," Don Benefield said. 
"When the paramedics came, they had to keep poking her to keep her awake." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who said she was in the living room when her daughter fell, said, "I 
didn't know anything was wrong until the guy called me from outside. At first I 
looked out the front, and then I went in the bedroom and saw the window open." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, Vic Anderson, have lived in the apartment since February, 
when they moved from Phoenix. LAURA MICHAELIS and MATT LAIT

GRAND JURY URGES MORE HEALTH FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its third report this spring on health care, the Orange County Grand Jury 
recommended Monday that local officials make public medical services "a higher 
priority" and spend more general funds on community clinics, services to 
pregnant women and county health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a great need" for perinatal care and expanded county health 
services, said Beverly Jacobs, chairwoman of the grand jury's health care 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Grand jurors estimate that 400,000 county residents have little or no insurance 
and often turn to community or county clinics. 
</P>
<P>
County officials responded that they would like to provide more money for 
health care. But citing a $40-million budget deficit this year, they warned of 
cutting services, not expanding them. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is the state is $60 million short, the county $40 million short," 
said Tom Uram, director of the county Health Care Agency. He said the county is 
planning cuts in health care if needed state funds fall through. 
</P>
<P>
Uram added that he has a list of programs he may cut, but that would not 
release it now because "I don't want any panic. You destroy morale when you put 
out a cutoff list." 
</P>
<P>
Don R. Roth, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors, also said there may 
be health-care cuts this year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the grand jury's latest report, as well as an accompanying 
analysis by the firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, three other counties of about 
the same size -- San Bernardino, San Diego and Santa Clara -- spend more of 
their own money on health care, although another comparable county, Sacramento, 
spends less. LANIE JONES

OFFER MADE TO MAN WOUNDED BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Liberian immigrant who was wounded by a police officer's shotgun blast is 
being offered $750,000 to $1.5 million to drop his lawsuit against the city, 
lawyers involved with the case said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement comes as the victim's lawsuit is scheduled to go to 
trial next Monday in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"The offer has been on the table for about 45 to 60 days," said Newport Beach 
City Atty. Robert Burnham, who indicated that the city's offer is "in the range 
of $750,000." An attorney for the victim, Sundaga Bryant, disagreed, saying the 
offer is worth $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred during the Labor Day weekend nearly two years ago. Bryant 
was standing on the beach near the Balboa Pier with his wife, Marlene, about 3 
a.m. on Sept. 4, 1988, when he was shot by Police Officer Derek Duncan. Duncan 
and other officers had responded to a report that a man in the area was 
carrying a sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
City officials concede that Bryant, now 27, was not armed -- he had only a 
radio slung over his right shoulder as he stood with his wife. The shotgun 
pellets that sliced through Bryant have left him with a "totally useless" left 
arm and "very restricted movement in his right arm," according to one of his 
lawyers, Christian W. Keena of Irvine. Bryant also has had surgery to remove a 
damaged colon. 
</P>
<P>
Keena said that Bryant, who once played on the Liberian national soccer team, 
is now unable to provide adequately for his family of four children. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked 2 1/2 jobs," Keena said of Bryant, who now lives in the San 
Bernardino County town of Rialto. "He was a male nurse, he drove a cab and he 
cleaned offices at night. Now he's reduced to a point where he can't even pick 
up a cereal bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, the city attorney, conceded that the shooting was a mistake. The calls 
to police warning of the sawed-off shotgun resulted in the detention nearby, at 
nearly the same time, of a 14-year-old who was carrying a pellet gun. 
</P>
<P>
Keena said the exact timing of when the 14-year-old was detained is important 
because that development may have been broadcast over the frequency monitored 
by portable police radios, including the equipment issued to Officer Duncan. 
Keena said the 14-year-old was stopped "several minutes" before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Potepan, a private attorney retained by the Newport Beach, declined to 
comment on when the teen-ager was detained or whether that development was 
broadcast on a frequency that Duncan could have received. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Burnham said he is confident that a jury would be convinced that 
Duncan, acting on what he knew at the hour of the shooting, did not perform 
negligently. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing last February by the Orange 
County district attorney's office. Sgt. Andy Gonis, a spokesman for the Newport 
Beach Police Department, said Monday that Duncan has been restored to "patrol, 
full duty." DAVID WILLMAN

WIFE DISAVOWED PREGNANCY, MAN SAYS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denying even her husband's suspicions, a woman who was arrested on suspicion of 
killing her newborn baby denied her pregnancy by insisting that her change in 
appearance was due to other medical problems, neighbors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Marchelle Lynn Black, 27, was arrested Sunday afternoon, several hours after 
her husband discovered the dead infant in a plastic bag in the bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Jeffrey Black often asked his wife if she was pregnant but she 
denied it. Jeffrey's father, Richard Black, said he believes that his 
daughter-in-law convinced even herself that she wasn't expecting a child. 
</P>
<P>
"She just kept denying it," Richard Black said outside the couple's 
two-bedroom, white stucco home. "It's amazing what the mind can do. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Black said his son and daughter-in-law had their ups and downs, but 
that "was like any marriage." 
</P>
<P>
"She was just worn out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blacks have three children, ages 3, 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Ann Navarro, a neighbor who said she is Marchelle Black's best friend, said 
she asked Marchelle every day for the past two weeks whether she was pregnant, 
but her friend kept denying it. In the past week, she had grown more tired, 
started walking in a hunchlike fashion and had gotten more nervous, Navarro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Black explained that her change in appearance was due to complications from a 
previous childbirth and that she planned to have a hysterectomy, Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Hospital in Norwalk notified police that Black had been admitted to the 
emergency room Saturday evening. She claimed that she had given the child away, 
but later told police that she had given birth in the bathtub and hid the baby 
in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro said Jeffrey Black, alarmed at his wife's appearance, kept urging her 
to see a doctor. Marchelle would say she made an appointment, but when the time 
came to go, she told her husband and friends that the appointment had been 
canceled, Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro's mother, Angie, said that on Saturday, Jeffrey demanded that Marchelle 
go to the doctor Monday. But later that day, she began hemorrhaging 
inexplicably. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Ann Navarro called her friend "a very good mother." 
</P>
<P>
"She had a lot of stress built up inside of her," Navarro said. "She wanted 
time off from her children . . . she was with her kids day and night." 
</P>
<P>
"To me, I think she was on the edge of a nervous breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
Marchelle Black is being held at Orange County Jail. Cypress police are 
expected to take their case to the district attorney's office today, when a 
decision will be made whether to file murder charges.TED JOHNSON

TREE LOSS IS UNKIND CUT TO RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For 38 years, Joe and Sally White enjoyed the beauty and shade provided by the 
Colorado ash tree that towered above their Anaheim home. 
</P>
<P>
The Whites say they moved to the neighborhood because its tree-lined streets 
made it among the most beautiful in the city. 
</P>
<P>
But now, a homemade tombstone reading R.I.P. sits atop some logs that mark the 
spot where the Colorado ash stood for almost 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a city street improvement project, all the trees on the city-owned 
parkway on the north side of West Broadway were cut down two weeks ago. And the 
south side is next. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a monument to all the healthy trees that were cut down," said Sally 
White, 75. "We feel we were betrayed by the city. We were told only the 
diseased trees would be cut down. Nobody objects to diseased trees being cut 
down, but we do object to perfectly healthy trees being cut -- especially in 
this day with so much concern about the environment." 
</P>
<P>
The tree removals follow more than two years of planning and neighborhood 
meetings that seem to have ended in misunderstandings on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the Engineering Department's intent to go through helter-skelter and 
remove trees," said Arthur Daw, deputy city engineer. "It was our feeling that 
we were doing what the property owners wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Daw said that a study of the nearly 60 oak, palm, ash and huckleberry trees 
lining one of the city's oldest neighborhoods showed that most of the trees 
wouldn't survive the street repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the trees were simply old and diseased and needed to be replaced, he 
said. And even though a number were listed in "excellent" condition, Daw said 
they were likely to have been damaged by the project because the street 
widening would cause roots to be cut and branches to be trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
Given the probable damage to the trees, Daw said he and other city officials 
were under the impression that the neighbors agreed that all the trees should 
go and be replaced by new ones. The city plans to plant more than 90 camphors 
that stand about 12 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
But the Whites and others thought that the handful of healthy trees on each 
side of Broadway would be saved. 
</P>
<P>
The residents said they would have preferred to baby their sick trees back to 
health than wait years for the replacements to grow. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly $1-million project will improve Broadway between Harbor Boulevard 
and Manchester Avenue. The city will build gutters, repave the streets, fix 
some sidewalks and upgrade the storm drains as part of a general improvement 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Daw said an earlier plan to widen the street was discarded after residents said 
they didn't want a bigger street and didn't want the trees removed. The city 
plans to notify residents before the rest of the trees on the street are cut 
down to prevent further misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
Sally White said she and about a dozen of her neighbors will approach the City 
Council on June 26 in an effort to save the other trees.LISA MASCARO

John J. Reeves has fine-tuned his body by playing tough half-court basketball 
three nights a week at the Santa Ana YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
He's not much of a shooter but says he can pop in a 10-footer every so often. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his shooting touch, "he's our hero," said attorney Stewart 
Suchman, 48, of Laguna Hills, one of the jocks who plays hard-nosed ball with 
him during those two-hour get-togethers under the hoop. "He's our inspiration," 
Suchman said. 
</P>
<P>
And no wonder.

Reeves will turn 70 on June 26.

His teammates are young enough to be his children. Maybe his grandchildren.

"I've been playing basketball with the same group of guys for (eight years). 
Most of them don't think about my age," said Reeves, who sometimes gets a 
helping hand if he gets knocked down. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll pick me up," he said, "but if I felt they were showing me preference, 
it would be time to do something else." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves learned to set a fancy pick for the hot shooters and enjoys playing 
defense and making good passes. 
</P>
<P>
How does it feel being the veteran? 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't mind, I don't mind. I can hold my own," said Reeves, who retired 
a few years ago but still works as a consultant for Bekins Moving &amp; 
Storage, his employer for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
He also owns a small advertising agency that he hopes to expand. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been playing basketball ever since I met him," said Mary Reeves, his wife 
of 40 years. They form a mutual admiration society. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way (playing basketball) happens is to be blessed with a good wife 
who lets me do it," John Reeves admitted. He and Mary have two sons and four 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
While he enjoys playing basketball, Reeves said, he was never good or tall 
enough to make his high school team, let alone the team at USC, where he earned 
an industrial design degree. He is six feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Instead he played in pickup games at school and during his service in the Navy 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be a pilot but found out I got airsick and ended up as a 
electrician's mate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his life, Reeves, a self-described jock, played basketball any time 
there was a pickup game going, and when there wasn't, he would play golf or 
softball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of strange, but I get more tired playing a round of golf than 
playing a hard game of basketball," said the Diamond Bar resident, who does 15 
minutes of stretching exercises before each game. "I really don't get that 
pooped playing basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said his doctor gave him some simple advice: "He says if I can do it, 
keep it up, and so far, nothing has gone wrong."

BARNETT WILL REMAIN COACH AT TRABUCO HILLS

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Barnett, football coach at Trabuco Hills High School, said Monday that he 
has turned down an offer to coach football at Big Sky High School in Missoula, 
Mont. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, who has been coach at Trabuco Hills since the school opened in 1985, 
was offered a contract by Big Sky last week after his hiring was approved by 
the district school board. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an opportunity, but it would have meant giving up everything I had 
worked for here," Barnett said. "Montana is where I grew up and I wanted to try 
coaching up there. But I have a lot of support from the parents at Trabuco 
Hills and it would be tough leaving the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett has guided the Mustangs to consecutive Southern Section championships. 
The Mustangs beat Orange for the Division VII championship last fall and 
defeated Woodbridge for the Desert-Mountain Conference title in 1988. CHRIS

GRADCO REPORTS LOSS OF $28 MILLION, SUES XEROX OVER A PATENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

IRVINE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gradco Systems Inc., battered by the loss of its largest customer, reported a 
$28.6-million loss for the fourth quarter ended March 31 and said that a group 
of Japanese investors had agreed to buy a 27% stake in its pivotal Japanese 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based manufacturer of sorters for copying machines and printers also 
disclosed that it has filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Xerox Corp., 
which with its two foreign affiliates had accounted for more than a third of 
Gradco's business. Xerox now manufacturers its own sorters. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco's poor fourth-quarter performance resulted in a $28.1-million loss on 
revenues of $89.5 million for the fiscal year, compared to $5.6 million in net 
earnings on revenues of $115.1 million in the previous year. The loss was due 
largely to a one-time, $23-million fourth-quarter charge resulting from a major 
restructuring announced earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization, which followed a failed effort by Gradco chairman Keith 
Stewart to take the company private in a leveraged buyout, resulted in the 
shutdown of a Santa Ana manufacturing facility and the transfer of all 
responsibility for copier products -- which account for 70% of the company's 
business -- to Gradco Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco said the $26.5-million investment in Gradco Japan would come from a 
group of Japanese institutional investors led by Japan Associated Finance Co. 
Ltd., or JAFCO. Stewart, in a statement, called the deal "another step in the 
process of taking Gradco Japan public on the Japanese over-the-counter market." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has in the past discussed the possibility of making such a public 
offering in Japan, though he had previously described such a step as only one 
of a number of financing measures under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the JAFCO transaction would result in an $18-million gain for 
the first quarter ended June 30, and that the cash would be used to retire debt 
and for working capital. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and other officials could not be reached for comment after Monday's 
announcement, which was made more than a month later than normal and after 
stock exchanges had closed. The company's shares closed up 50 cents at $11.50 
in over-the-counter trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gradco said when it announced the restructuring that it would hurt 
earnings, the $23-million figure was far higher than anticipated and far above 
the $10 million that chief financial officer Steve Nabor acknowledged as a 
ballpark estimate in April. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart confirmed in February that the company had lost a major contract with 
Xerox, and Gradco said Monday that it had lost $21 million in sales as a result 
of Xerox's efforts to make its own sorters. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco said it was seeking damages and an injunction against Xerox Corp. in its 
patent-infringement lawsuit, claiming that it had lost "in excess of $100 
million" as a result of Xerox's actions. Although Stewart said in February that 
Fuji Xerox, a major Japanese maker of copiers, was still a major customer, 
Gradco said Monday that Fuji Xerox and Rank Xerox of the United Kingdom were 
also infringing its patents. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the loss of the Xerox business, revenues for the quarter were down 
sharply. Stewart said that "the company will continue to feel the effect of the 
loss of the Xerox business in the first half of the new fiscal year. However, 
we expect a strong second half as we commence delivery of several new products 
in both the copier and printer markets." 
</P>
<P>
However, when Gradco in February reported an unexpected loss for the third 
quarter, Stewart called it a "temporary decline" that "will not have a lasting 
effect into next year." 
</P>
<P>
Gradco, which went public in 1983, was once a favorite growth stock on Wall 
Street but has experienced wild fluctuations in both its earnings performance 
and stock price over the years. The stock traded as high as $18.50 last 
September on the strength of the buyout possibility but later plunged below $9. 
</P>
<P>
The Pritzker family of Chicago controls about 6% of Gradco's shares and has 
periodically been rumored to be contemplating a buyout. Plenum Publishing Corp. 
of New York took an 8% stake in the company last year. And Stewart has been 
discussing buyout possibilities with Japanese investors since early last year. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco has long relied on its patented moving-bin sorter for mid-sized copying 
machines as its core product, and investors were attracted by the strength of 
that technology and the broad potential in paper-handling equipment for 
copiers, printers and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
But despite a string of acquisitions in the printer field, the moving-bin 
sorter still accounts for a majority of Gradco's revenues. Analysts have said 
the company could be vulnerable if copier manufacturers such as Xerox were able 
to develop an effective sorter that did not infringe on Gradco's patents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GRADCO'S PERFORMANCE 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter ended March 31, Gradco Systems Inc. reported a loss of 
$28.7 million as its revenues plunged 36% to $18.5 million. The company 
attributed the loss to a one-time $23 million restructuring charge.

J.M. PETERS REPORTS 68% DECREASE IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what officials said was a result of the softening market for expensive new 
homes, J.M. Peters Co. on Monday reported a 68% drop in first-quarter earnings 
even as revenues increased 21%. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach-based home builder reported net income of $1.6 million on 
revenues of $67.1 million for the first quarter, ended May 31, of its fiscal 
1991 year, compared to net earnings of $5 million on revenues of $55.5 million 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the earnings report, Peters' stock fell 37.5 cents a share Monday 
to close at $7 on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"Their revenue was up, but the (profit) margin was down, largely because of the 
cost of carrying so much inventory," said Barbara Allen, a housing industry 
analyst with the Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. brokerage in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said Peters is spending about $1 million a month on finance and other 
charges related to maintaining its inventory of about 500 homes and also is 
spending money on buyer incentives and price reductions as it attempts to move 
homes in a slow market. 
</P>
<P>
Peters' low first-quarter earnings, she said, are a result of the company's 
focus in Orange County, where inventories have swelled in the 
$300,000-to-$500,000 price range, in which Peters specializes. 
</P>
<P>
Peters' spokesman Brian Theriot agreed with some of Allen's comments but said 
the company had little choice but to build homes in the last year because it 
had been issued permits and would have lost the allotments had it not used 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a building phase in a number of projects," he said. "And once you 
are in that phase, you are pretty much committed to completing or you can lose 
your permits. It just happens that the areas we are strong in are areas that 
happen to be oversupplied." 
</P>
<P>
Peters has rolled prices back on some homes, especially in the overbuilt South 
Orange County market and offers buyers a variety of incentives, including 
landscaping and decorating allowances that effectively lower the price of the 
completed home, but it does so on a case-by-case basis, Theriot said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that while the company has a total inventory of about 510 
homes, about 170 of them are in escrow, leaving only 340 built but unsold. "So 
that isn't a traumatic level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While many of those escrows are contingent on the buyers selling their current 
homes, Theriot said, the company is confident that most of its homes will be 
sold in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be a slower year -- there is no doubt about that," Theriot 
said. "But it will be a profitable year." 
</P>
<P>
Gross profit percentages on housing sales for the first quarter were 13.4%, 
down from 22.8% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Indicative of the slowdown in the "move-up" market in which Peters specializes, 
the company said it had firm sales contracts for 146 homes during the first 
quarter, down 41.6% from 250 in the year-earlier first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 163 home sales were closed in the first quarter, up from 142 homes 
in the first quarter of fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
J. M. PETERS' PERFORMANCE 
</P>
<P>
A drop-off in the profit margin on home sales from 22.8% in the first quarter a 
year ago to 13.4% in fiscal 1991 quarter cut sharply into net earnings for the 
period, ending May 31, 1990.

JOURNAL WILL PUBLISH ISOPRINOSINE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From A Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Pharmaceuticals said Monday that a leading medical journal has agreed 
to publish a study of the company's drug, Isoprinosine, in the fight against 
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills-based company said it would release further details Thursday 
at a press conference at the International AIDS Conference in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Newport stock has shot up 66% since Thursday and closed Monday at $2.8125 in 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
The article focuses on a Scandinavian study of 866 individuals infected with 
human immunodeficiency virus, some of whom were treated with Isoprinosine. Some 
19 of those patients contracted AIDS within a year, and of these, two were on 
Isoprinosine while 17 were on placebos. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Pharmaceuticals hailed the study as proof of the drug's merit in 
combating HIV, but studies in the United States and the United Kingdom have 
concluded that Isoprinosine is ineffective for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has criticized the company in the past 
for conducting incomplete tests on Isoprinosine and for improperly promoting 
it.

IT'LL BE BUSINESS AS USUAL AT MOLA, EXECUTIVE SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE FAILURE OF CHARTER SAVINGS BANK WILL HAVE 'NO EFFECT' ON NEWPORT 
BEACH-BASED MOLA DEVELOPMENT CORP., ITS FORMER PARENT COMPANY, PETER VON ELTEN 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The failure of Charter Savings Bank last week will have "absolutely no effect" 
on the continuing operations of its former parent company, Mola Development 
Corp., an executive with the Newport Beach real estate firm said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mola will continue to conduct business "as usual," said Peter von Elten, Mola's 
executive vice president and a former Charter director. 
</P>
<P>
The company is awaiting final approval on a controversial 149-acre $200-million 
residential project in Seal Beach for which it has already spent between $8 
million and $10 million to develop plans. A favorable court hearing Wednesday 
and City Council approval on Monday are the final hurdles, Von Elten said. 
</P>
<P>
Mola also is working out a financing deal to start construction on its 
high-rise Mola Centre in Irvine, a $300-million mixed-use project that has been 
in the planning stages for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten said Mola and Charter executives expected the takeover of the thrift, 
especially after Mola decided not to invest any more money in Charter. But he 
denounced federal regulators for saying they had asked the U.S. Justice 
Department to look into the possibility of criminal wrongdoing at Charter, 
which has its headquarters next door to Mola. 
</P>
<P>
When they seized Charter on Friday, regulators said they made a "number of 
referrals" to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
"There certainly shouldn't be any criminal allegation against any individual or 
executive here," Von Elten said. "Mola never used Charter to finance its 
projects. We've conducted ourselves properly." 
</P>
<P>
The referrals for a criminal inquiry "seems to be an action they're taking with 
each and every institution" they seize, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The call for a criminal investigation also took state regulators by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly didn't have any inkling of this," said William D. Davis, acting 
commissioner of the state Department of Savings and Loans. He described Mola's 
owner, Frank J. Mola, as a "very reliable person." 
</P>
<P>
One industry source knowledgeable about the referrals said the request centers 
on two sets of loan transactions. The source would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Both Davis and Von Elten said Charter's 1988 acquisition of failing Merit 
Savings &amp; Loan in Los Angeles became an albatross, especially after the 
federal thrift rescue law, enacted last year, set up tough capital standards. 
</P>
<P>
"The Merit acquisition just killed them," Davis said. "It had a drastic effect 
on their operating ability. They had monthly operating losses that were 
significant. Couple that with the new law's dictates on capital and net worth, 
and they were just not able to recover." 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten also objected to comments made Friday by the Office of Thrift 
Supervision that Charter was plagued by poorly documented files and bad 
management and that it was operating in an unsafe and unsound manner. 
</P>
<P>
In routine examinations, he said, federal agents always praised Charter for its 
clean operations. And any unsafe operating claim is based solely on the 
thrift's low level of capital, its final reserve against losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators determined that, under the tougher standards, Charter had run out of 
capital. They also rejected Mola's offer to add $4 million in capital. 
</P>
<P>
After the new law changed the rules, Von Elten said, "the only question was 
whether we wanted to put more capital into Charter." 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at it real carefully, and we decided we had no further interest in 
being in the S&amp;L industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mola Development, incorporated in 1976, started out by specializing in 
residential projects. During the last six years, it has expanded to commercial 
and industrial developments as well. 
</P>
<P>
It acquired Orange Coast Savings &amp; Loan in 1984, changed the name and 
increased the thrift's assets from $125 million to $450 million. Charter had 
$308.6 million in assets at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
"We saved taxpayers money by taking over Orange Coast Savings, which had a heck 
of a lot of problems, and by acquiring Merit without federal assistance, and we 
turned that around," Von Elten said. "The irony is that if regulators had not 
permitted us to acquire Merit, there would have been no problem at Charter."

MORE COMMUTERS ARE SEEKING, FINDING ALTERNATIVES TO THE CAR LIFESTYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ultimately, it is the individual commuter making a decision to somehow change 
his or her commute, who is going to have the greatest impact on our 
transportation picture. 
</P>
<P>
 -- State of the Commute Report, May, 1990 
</P>
<P>
For Brad Confer, administrative staff assistant for the West Hollywood City 
Council, the moment of decision occurred six months ago when his 1979 Buick 
broke down, again, on Sunset Boulevard during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It just died on the street and I'd had enough," he said. "My car insurance was 
$1,400 a year and I was real tired of being hostage to insurance, gas station 
lines and traffic snarls. I decided to take a year off and see what it's like 
not having a car. So far I have been able to address all my needs." 
</P>
<P>
For Monica Price of the City of Orange, it was the congested drive to her job 
at Burlington Air Express in Irvine. "I just couldn't deal with the traffic on 
the 55 Freeway," she said. "It's bumper-to-bumper from the 91 all the way to 
Costa Mesa. Now my husband and I drive together. We can take the inside 
(car-pool) lane and we just laugh as we pass everybody else. It's a wonderful 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
For Morgan Ferry of Costa Mesa, a computer programmer at Avco Financial 
Services, it was his company's highly promoted ride-share program, offering 
cash bonuses for car-pooling and double cash bonuses for any mode of 
transportation that wasn't a car. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd ridden my bike to work a few times and decided to try it on a full-time 
basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I take an off-road bicycle trail around the Newport back bay -- it's a 
wildlife preserve with rabbits and herons and hawks. I liked it so much, my 
wife Janet has started doing the same thing. The extra pay is a nice incentive, 
but I have to say if they stopped paying me I would still do it. It makes me 
feel good about myself." 
</P>
<P>
These are three voices in a small but growing chorus of Southern California 
drivers who have made the decision to change their commuting habits. If they 
can't kick the habit, at least they can cut down. A few expert traffic-watchers 
detect something new stirring: These recovering single-passenger automobile 
addicts might be the leading edge of a movement to give up car dependency for 
getting to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
The number of drive-alone commuters actually dropped 4% last year, according to 
the second annual State of the Commute Report issued by Commuter Transportation 
Services. At the same time, the level of awareness about alternatives to 
driving alone (car pools, van pools, telecommute, biking) increased 
substantially, as did commuter concern about worsening traffic. 
</P>
<P>
So far their numbers haven't reversed the tide. Based on interviews with 
commuters in five counties, the same report concluded that almost everything 
has gotten worse since last year. The average commute takes 10 to 15 minutes 
longer, freeway rush hour starts earlier and ends later and 79% of Southern 
California's commuters still drive alone in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
But some observers see a flicker of real change. 
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic," said Jim Sims, president of Commuter Transportation Services 
Inc., which has been surveying Southland commuting patterns and perceptions 
closely for two years. "I believe we have some real potential to change 
peoples' habits in terms of the trip to work." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm cheery. There are signs that didn't exist before," said Ralph Cipriani, 
principal planner for regional mobility for the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments (SCAG), whose plans call for a dramatic shift in commute patterns 
by the year 2010. "I think awareness is increasing rapidly that the single car 
isn't going to work anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Even the most upbeat forecasters suggest that the situation may have to get a 
little worse before it gets better. "We are very optimistic over the long 
range," said Dana Woodbury, interim director of planning at RTD, which is 
looking at carrying a 300% increase in public transit commuters over the next 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't become all that inconvenient yet for people to use their cars, but 
it's going to. In the meantime, there's a lot of stuff being put in place to 
accommodate them." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude predicts that "we are on the verge of 
a big breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
A 25-year bicycle rider and environmental activist, he ticked off some of the 
signs of change: "The government policy is shifting very quickly to accommodate 
the needs of the commuter to get out of the single-occupied car. We know not 
everyone will, nor is it necessary, but a significant number of people will. 
</P>
<P>
"We are improving the bus system, we are creating high-occupancy (HOV) lanes on 
freeways, we are inaugurating a light rail system in July, we are providing 
preferential parking for people who ride together or ride in van pools, 
corporations are subsidizing car pools and van pools, we are working to change 
the tax system so corporations are encouraged to assist employees to ride 
public transit or ride share, we have expanded the express commuter bus 
system." 
</P>
<P>
On the side of negative pressure, Braude cited the increasing cost of commuting 
alone. "The cost of accidents, insurance, parking, is greater. The tax on 
gasoline is going up. There are going to be many more economic incentives to 
utilize public transit." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those tangible considerations, Braude, like others, talked about 
a changed attitude stemming from increased environmental awareness, something 
that was mentioned frequently in interviews with commuters and commuter 
watchers. "It's becoming more fashionable to ride-share or use public transit," 
said Braude. "It is becoming more healthy, people feel more human." 
</P>
<P>
In short, the traffic crisis is producing ethical choices. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way Mark Pisano, executive director of SCAG, which co-sponsored the 
State of the Commute Report, puts it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not yet seeing relief from congestion because of increased growth in 
population, automobiles and number of trips," he said last week. "However my 
sense is that we are beginning to see a change in the responsiveness of the 
driving public -- a change from individuals just driving alone to individuals 
willing to car-pool, willing to take transit, more open to working at home at 
least one or two days a week, changing their hours when they go to work." 
</P>
<P>
He characterizes the change as the development of a "congestion relief ethic," 
and he thinks it is the key to unlocking traffic gridlock in Southern 
California. "Just like we turn the light off when we leave a room or turn the 
shower water off when we soap up, in order to conserve energy and water, we 
need to make a conscious effort to reduce traffic." 
</P>
<P>
That is not a new notion for everyone, however. Among the many Southern 
Californians who have long viewed commuting as an ethical choice is Ben Swets, 
32, of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
A commercial photographer who regularly bikes to corporate clients in downtown 
Los Angeles loaded with 20 to 30 pounds of cameras, strobe lights and lenses, 
Swets can be lyrical about his commute style. "I've ridden bicycles all my 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bike is a metaphor for simplicity, and simplicity -- of the way we eat, 
the way we purchase, the way we travel -- implies responsibility. The work of 
pedaling a bicycle is a kind of responsible act toward our society, our 
descendants." 
</P>
<P>
Pedaling downtown along Pico or Venice boulevards, Swets passes cars and "feels 
eternally grateful that I am not sitting down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting alone in a car habitually is sort of like a religious ritual: It 
promotes the notion that we have to consume, that we are living for the goal of 
our own pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the bicycle implies not taking more than your share."

SECRECY OF NEIL BUSH PROBE DECRIED; 
</P>
<P>
'LIFT VEIL' ON QUERY INTO S&amp;L FAILURE, CONGRESSMAN URGES

A House Banking Committee member called on federal regulators today to "lift 
the veil of secrecy" surrounding their investigation of President Bush's son, 
Neil, in connection with a Colorado thrift collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"If it has brought charges against Neil Bush, it should make those charges 
public," Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) said, referring to the federal Office of 
Thrift Supervision. "No law or regulation prevents the agency from revealing 
the charges." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush denied any wrongdoing in the collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. of Denver. He appeared May 23 before the committee, which was 
probing whether his business interests in Colorado conflicted with his role as 
a director of Silverado. He called allegations of conflict of interest 
"frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm calling on the Office of Thrift Supervision to lift the veil of secrecy 
which shrouds this matter," Annunzio said at the outset of the latest hearing 
on the Silverado failure. 
</P>
<P>
Annunzio cited an undated and unsigned internal Office of Thrift Supervision 
document that he said contained proposed charges against Neil Bush. But he said 
no charges were ever brought nor has there been any indication of whether any 
charges will be forthcoming from the government. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I checked, Neil Bush's father was the head of that 
organization," Annunzio said. 
</P>
<P>
"Can any agency of the United States fairly and impartially investigate the son 
of the President of the United States?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Stan Parris (R-Va.) defended Neil Bush, noting that he has declared his 
innocence and citing a May 22 statement by federal regulators that they could 
find no basis for issuing a prohibition on his further involvement in the 
banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
Parris said the document cited by Annunzio "is undated. It's unsigned. It was 
never circulated. It is in fact, a draft. . . . Mr. Bush appeared here 
voluntarily . . . for eight hours. . . . He believes he is innocent of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think . . . it raises the question: Is Neil Bush paying a penalty because of 
who he is, not being given some kind of unique benefits because of who he may 
be?" 
</P>
<P>
One focus of the hearings is the length of time it took regulators to close the 
thrift after problems developed. The thrift was closed in late 1988, two years 
after trouble surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been more costly than regulatory hesitation through the entire 
savings and loan crisis," committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said in 
an opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House blasted Democrats for the S &amp; L crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"A big part of the problem here is that in the dead of night a few years ago, 
the Democrats pushed through a bill raising the limits (of coverage for insured 
deposits) to $100,000 a person," said White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater. The increase was part of a broader, bipartisan bill to overhaul the 
entire S &amp; L industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm saying the Democrats have a big role in it," he said.

<P>
Juvenile court judge today denied permission for 14-year-old Richard Hubler to 
attend the funeral of the 12-year-old sister he is accused of murdering. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler was arrested last Thursday and charged with the shooting death of his 
sister, Gema Marie Hubler, in their Anaheim Shores home. 
</P>
<P>
The girl died Monday at UCI Medical Center after being removed from a life 
support system. 
</P>
<P>
The blond, lanky Hubler remained in handcuffs during a detention hearing this 
morning at which Orange County Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson explained 
the charges against him. Hubler will be tried as a juvenile. If convicted of 
murder with a firearm he could be held by the California Youth Authority until 
he is 25. 
</P>
<P>
The judge denied without elaboration a request by Hubler's attorney, Deputy 
Public Defender Sharon Petrosino to permit Hubler to leave Juvenile Hall to 
attend Gema's funeral on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Marty Enquist said Hubler was on probation for another 
offense at the time of the shooting and should be kept in custody until his 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"He has committed past acts of a violent nature, and the violence in this case 
certainly speaks for itself," Enquist said.

A man demanding to be taken to the United States today hijacked a Soviet 
airliner with 60 people on board and threatened to blow it up, authorities 
said. He later surrendered and sought political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
The 55 passengers and five crew members safely left the aircraft, parked beside 
a runway at Helsinki airport and surrounded by police. The hijacker gave up an 
hour later after talks with Finnish officials through a cabin door of the 
twin-jet Tupolev 134. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet Deputy Aviation Minister Mikhail Timofeev identified the 
hijacker as Oleg Kozlov, 22. Timofeev said the man had threatened to blow up 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Finnish Interior Minister Jarmo Rantanen said that no explosives were found on 
the plane but that the hijacker "had a bomb-like object under his jacket." 
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports persisted that three people were involved, and Finnish 
authorities said they were holding the 55 passengers overnight for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Finnish Radio reported without explanation that three men were arrested but 
that only one was suspected of hijacking. Rantanen told the radio: "We thought 
that he had two assistants, but we are not so sure now." 
</P>
<P>
All the passengers were Soviets, Rantanen said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane had been en route from the Latvian capital of Riga to Murmansk on the 
northern Kola Peninsula when it was hijacked.

The United States has agreed to return to Japan a small portion of the land 
used by U.S. military bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, 
officials announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Land totaling 2,500 acres in 23 sites will be returned, according to an interim 
report released by the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee on Realignment and 
Consolidation of U.S. Forces Facilities on Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
The report listed part of a practice area at the northern end of the island, 
part of Camp Hansen in central Okinawa, and part of the Kadena ammunition 
storage area and Yaedake communications facility in northeastern Okinawa as 
being among the sites to be returned. 
</P>
<P>
The land being returned, however, makes up only a few percent of 62,000 acres 
taken up by U.S. military bases on Okinawa, a U.S. territory from 1945 until 
its reversion to Japan in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
American bases take up 20% of Okinawa prefecture's main island, and until the 
mid-1970s were the Okinawans' most important source of income. 
</P>
<P>
Of 50,000 U.S. troops in JapaN, about 35,000 are stationed on Okinawa.

Separate suspicious fires erupted within minutes of each other in five 
buildings occupied by Rutgers University fraternities, fire officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, but 21 students were left homeless by the blazes, all of 
which were reported between 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. Monday, said Deputy Fire 
Chief James Riley. 
</P>
<P>
"These were very suspicious fires," Riley said. "They were practically 
simultaneous. We don't have any idea who lit them yet. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
All the fires were out by 1 a.m. today, although campus authorities ordered the 
fraternities to appoint students to stay up all night and guard the houses, 
said Teresa Loser, dean of fraternity and sorority affairs at Rutgers.

A judge said poems by an Israeli Arab incited violence and today placed him 
under house arrest. It was one of the strongest steps against an Arab citizen 
during the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Israel radio said the judge also ordered that any poetry by Shafik Habib be 
submitted to the military censor before publication. 
</P>
<P>
Habib, a 49-year-old accountant, said in a telephone interview that police were 
"trying to set a precedent. We are in a democratic country. There should be 
freedom of expression." 
</P>
<P>
He called the action "a very serious move against an Arab intellectual." 
</P>
<P>
An Arab legislator demanded a parliamentary debate on the action against the 
poet. "This regime is very weak if they are afraid of words," legislator Abdul 
Wahab Darousha said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamal Kawwar, chairman of the Palestinian Israeli Writers' Union, said Habib is 
the first Israeli Arab citizen to be arrested for his writings.

PULL CHIP OFF MARKET, MOTOROLA ORDERED

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge today ordered Motorola Inc. to pull a key computer chip off the 
market, dealing a setback to the company in a legal battle over trade secrets 
with former partner Hitachi Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The order will also prevent Hitachi from selling its own microprocessor in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola said it will immediately appeal the decision by U.S. District Judge 
Lucius D. Bunton of Midland. Bunton's order was released in Austin, where 
Motorola's MC68030 microprocessor is made. 
</P>
<P>
A microprocessor is a computer chip that handles the processing functions in a 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement from its Schaumburg, Ill., headquarters, Motorola said it 
expects a patent appeals court to stay Bunton's order. The company said it is 
confident that it will continue to provide an uninterrupted supply of its 
market-leading microprocessor to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Bunton banned the sale of the chips March 29 and fined both companies, saying 
they violated each other's patents. 
</P>
<P>
But he stayed the order a day later after Motorola argued that the chip ban 
could devastate outside computer makers that depend on Motorola microprocessors 
to run their machines. 
</P>
<P>
Today's order lifts the stay. The judge said the companies have been given 
enough time to settle on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"The parties have chosen not to forge a settlement in the interim, and this 
court is not inclined to continue its indulgence," Bunton said. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola contends that Bunton's order gives Hitachi unequal bargaining power in 
any settlement negotiations because, as Bunton said in his order, Motorola's 
processor is more "commercially viable" than Hitachi's. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi said it needed the injunction because Motorola could continue to design 
around the MC68030, which would eliminate any incentive for Motorola to settle 
the patent infringement dispute.

The Belgian national airline Sabena today said it had suffered an operating 
loss of more than $36 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the results before the group's annual stockholders meeting, Sabena 
Chairman Carlos Van Rafelghem said: "We won't be able to go on living through 
such situations." 
</P>
<P>
Sabena, British Airways and Dutch KLM last year set up Sabena World Airways. BA 
and KLM each have 20% stakes in the new operating company. 
</P>
<P>
The company's senior vice president, Gerard Spinnox, said the outlook for 1990 
is not good, saying the airline could be heading for an overall loss of $42.8 
million for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Rafelghem said Sabena's flight operations had been "marginal" for the year. He 
said the company may have to "disinvest" in the coming year.

Stocks of defense-related industries plunged on the London International stock 
exchange today in response to the British government's announcement it will 
slash an estimated $1.03 billion from the military budget. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Procurement Minister Alan Clark said in Parliament late Monday that 
inflation had placed extraordinary pressure on the military's running costs, 
prompting that $1.03 billion be trimmed from the $36.25-billion defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
The government also said the cuts were due to the easing of East-West 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit by the news was British Aerospace, which lost a $906-million order 
for 33 Tornado fighter-bombers. British Aerospace stock tumbled 37 cents a 
share to $8.60, but managed to stage a slow recovery around midday. 
</P>
<P>
Setbacks were suffered by other companies linked to the manufacture of 
Tornadoes, a nuclear-capable aircraft designed for attacking the Soviet Union. 
Tornadoes are built in the northwestern English town of Warton in cooperation 
with Italian and West German firms.

Cable News Network plans live broadcasts of most events during Nelson R. 
Mandela's visit to eight U.S. cities beginning this week, but other networks 
will limit most coverage to regular news programs. 
</P>
<P>
CNN spokesman John Bianchi said CNN will report live on the South African black 
nationalist leader's June 20-July 1 visits to New York, Boston, Washington, 
Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
He said separate scheduled events involving Winnie Mandela will be taped for 
showing on regular news programs. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is to be guest at a special "Town Meeting" to be taped Thursday at City 
College of New York for broadcast that evening on ABC, and will also appear on 
the network that night as a guest on Ted Koppel's "Nightline." ABC was 
undecided about further live coverage as of Monday noon, spokesman Arnot Walker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said CBS will cover the Mandela visit "if news 
warrants" but planned no prior announcement. 
</P>

NBC plans regular coverage and is undecided whether to cover live the African 
leader's scheduled address to a joint session of Congress next week, said 
network spokeswoman Catherine McQuay. His arrival in New York on Wednesday will 
be broadcast live on the NBC "Today" show, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is scheduled for two appearances Friday on PBS, a live 15-minute 
interview with co-host Robert MacNeil on "The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour" at 7

Despite a setback from the U.S. Supreme Court, country music star Hank Williams 
Jr. plans to continue his fight against a woman who claims to be his father's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The high court Monday let stand a ruling that Cathy Yvonne Stone, 37, a country 
music performer known as Jett Williams, is entitled to have her fight for some 
of the late country music legend's royalties put before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the court left intact an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that 
declared Stone an heir to the elder Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear the case -- this is not a judgement 
-- and we're simply going to seek other remedies," said Merle Kilgore, Hank 
Jr.'s manager. 
</P>
<P>
Stone was born in 1953, five days after Hank Sr. died at age 29. Her mother, 
Bobbie Jett, and Williams had signed an agreement months earlier in which he 
acknowledged that he might be the father of the then-unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said she has won the five-year fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's as big a victory for my father, Hank Williams, as myself," she 
said. "This is what should have been done in the beginning."

LIZ SMITH: 'TRACY' IS GREAT; DISNEY CAN FORGET ABOUT JITTERS 
</P>

BEFORE Warner Bros. released "Batman" last year, I thought we'd seen the height 
of studio public relations jitters. Everybody connected was one big basket 
case. But Warner Bros. relaxed after "Batman" pulled in its first $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
This behavior, however, is nothing compared to the nail-biting, hair-pulling 
and hand-wringing that has occupied the executives at Disney over the last 
month as their star-director-producer Warren Beatty and his "Dick Tracy" stood 
champing at the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think, observing all this, that Disney was "up the creek," that the movie 
had come in millions over budget and that its creator-protagonist had sunk 
every last cent of his own into the film and would be run out of Hollywood on a 
rail if "Dick Tracy" weren't an unqualified hit. Not so. Disney is doing great, 
the movie came in within the $30-million budget, and Warren is rich, rich, rich 
and will remain a big power in the movie biz no matter how "Dick Tracy" fares 
at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
SO, WITH that out of the way, how is the movie? It's absolutely dazzling! A few 
people here and there don't care for it, but believe me, they are not the norm. 
Here is a movie so visually stunning and so unique in concept that dialogue and 
story can be and are minimal. The real stars of "Dick Tracy" are not Beatty and 
Madonna but cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, production designer Richard 
Sylbert, costumer Milena Canonero, makeup men John Caglione Jr. and Doug 
Drexler. (The latter have created the fantastically grotesque faces of the 
immortal Chester Gould characters: Flat Top, Lips Manliss, The Brow, Little 
Face, Pruneface, Spaldoni.) 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Big Boy Caprice, played with manic, comic vulgarity by Al Pacino. 
Also, there is Mumbles, with Dustin Hoffman doing the mumbling in what has to 
be a little inside joke between Hoffman and Beatty. It is a real measure of 
Beatty's power that he managed to assemble a truly great cast in these 
character roles -- William Forsythe, Paul Sorvino, Chuck Hicks, R. J. 
Armstrong, James Caan, as well as Dick Van Dyke as the D.A., Charles Durning as 
the Chief, etc. 
</P>
<P>
GLENNE HEADLY, as Tracy's true blue girlfriend, Tess Trueheart, is simply 
marvelous -- wry and sexy. 
</P>
<P>
And "The Kid," Charlie Korsmo, is the best acting find after years of our 
wallowing in "kid stuff."

ASK DR. RUTH: GUILT COULD MAKE SELF ORGASM A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Q. I am a 35-year-old woman, happily married for seven years. Our sex life is 
OK, but I am seldom orgasmic unless I masturbate. My problem is that I get a 
terrible headache right after reaching orgasm through masturbation. My 
gynecologist says there is no medical reason for this. If masturbation is 
supposed to be normal, why am I having this problem? And what can I do about 
it? 
</P>
<P>
A. It is not possible to answer this with so little information. If I had you 
here in my office, I would ask many questions. You might be suffering from 
guilt because you believe, deep down, that masturbation is sinful or wrong. I 
cannot determine this is your problem, however, simply from reading a brief 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
Does your husband ever masturbate you to orgasm? And if he does, do you still 
get headaches? If the answer is "no," I am inclined to believe you have a 
psychological, not a physical, problem. 
</P>
<P>
But still, I am worried that you might have a medical problem your gynecologist 
is missing -- perhaps because you did not present the facts clearly to him. Try 
again. If there is absolutely no medical problem, see a psychotherapist. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I am a 25-year-old woman. My husband had an affair while I was pregnant with 
our first child. He apologized and wept. I forgave him. Now I've had the baby, 
a beautiful boy. He is 6 months old. We are having sex again, but I am not 
enjoying it. I want to know if it is common for women not to enjoy sex for a 
long time after childbirth. Or, am I not able to let myself go with him in bed 
because of the affair? 
</P>
<P>
A. While some women eagerly anticipate resuming sexual relations, others do 
need more time after childbirth before they are ready to engage in sex again. 
That may be true for you. 
</P>
<P>
However, I suspect your situation is compounded by the affair. Some people, 
both men and women, find it hard to have good sexual relations with a partner 
who has cheated on them -- even though they have "forgiven" the partner. 
</P>
<P>
Suppressed anger may periodically surface in you for some time to come. 
Unfortunately, you are taking that anger out on yourself. You are having sex, 
but not letting yourself enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
You must go talk to a psychotherapist right away. You need to identify your 
feelings and talk about them. Your husband's tearful repentance may have made 
it difficult for you to express your own sadness and anger.

New York First Lady Matilda Cuomo signed two agreements today to expand 
scientific and medical exchanges between her state and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is always a great pleasure for me to return to the country of my parents, 
relatives and friends -- especially to take part in efforts to deepen the 
friendship between Italy and New York state," Cuomo said shortly before signing 
the documents. 
</P>
<P>
The wife of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is on a weeklong visit to promote children's 
rights, economic and cultural exchanges and the 500th anniversary of 
Christopher Columbus' discovery of America. 
</P>
<P>
She signed the accords as the co-chairwoman of the New York State program that 
promotes cooperation with Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Under one of the agreements, Italy's National Research Council will exchange 
information and scientists with the New York State Science and Technology 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Through another accord, the Italian council will set up research fellowships 
with the Graduate School of Public Health at the State University of New York 
and share information on health issues. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo told reporters that she also was working with Italy's hot line to aid 
abused children. New York State will participate in Italy's first national 
conference on child abuse in May, 1991, she said.

THOMPSON HASN'T DECIDED ABOUT BECOMING MANAGER OF THE NUGGETS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Thompson said today that he still hasn't decided whether he will leave 
Georgetown, where he has coached for 18 years, to become general manager of the 
Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is considering an offer worth more than $6 million from the NBA team. 
Reports said he was presented with a four- or five-year deal worth $700,000 per 
year and as much as 4% ownership of the Nuggets. That percentage would be worth 
about $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think I'm considering an offer, you're absolutely right. If you think 
I've made up my mind, you're absolutely wrong," the basketball coach said at a 
news conference at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he was just starting to talk to Georgetown officials about the 
offer and would not set a timetable on making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's agent, David Falk of Arlington, Va.-based ProServ, was in Chicago 
today, as were Nuggets General Counsel Glen Grunwald and team President Carl 
Scheer. But Thompson said the three had no plans to meet. 
</P>
<P>
"David's not there on my behalf," Thompson said at a news conference at the 
school. "He also happens to represent a young man named Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
Scheer confirmed that an offer was made to Thompson, adding: "The ball's in his 
court." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time an NBA team has tried to woo Thompson from 
Georgetown, where he has a 423-142 record and guided the Hoyas to the 1984 
national championship. Several NBA teams have approached Thompson, including 
the New York Knicks and Seattle SuperSonics, Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an annual thing with John," Falk said. "Where it goes from here is up 
to John. There have been discussions, but no agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Falk, who also represents Jordan, Patrick Ewing and Boomer Esiason, said 
Thompson already has had two meetings with Nuggets owners Peter Bynoe, Bertram 
Lee and Bob Wussler, the last a lengthy Sunday session in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bynoe's only comment was: "The organization stands by the statement of Carl 
Scheer. I am not at liberty to discuss the details of our meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said in Monday's late editions of USA Today: "I would say I'll be 
coaching at Georgetown next year. That's what I believe will happen, (but) we 
are exploring our options. I think I owe it to myself to listen any time 
somebody proposes something to me." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson earns more than $400,000 as Georgetown coach and has a contract with 
Nike Inc. that pays him about $250,000 a year.

YUGOSLAVIA ADVANCES TO 2ND ROUND BY DEFEATING UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

<P>
Yugoslavia qualified for the second round of the World Cup finals with a 4-1 
win today over the United Arab Emirates, underdogs in Group D of the soccer 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Two goals by Darko Pancev, a replacement for the injured Srecko Katanec, and 
one apiece by veteran Safet Susic and Robert Prosinecki gave Yugoslavia the 
victory it needed to advance from the round-robin stage for the first time 
since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Striker Ali Thani Juma caught Yugoslav goalkeeper Tomislav Ivkovic flat-footed 
to score a goal for the Emirates, but the team's final appearance at its first 
World Cup was marred by injuries and the disqualification of a player with a 
red card. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Thani limped off at halftime and leading midfielder Nasser Khamis Mubark 
also had to leave in the first half after a foul which earned Yugoslav 
midfielder Dragoljub Brnovic a yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
The UAE was reduced to 10 men in the 77th minute when Khalil Ghanim received a 
red card for a foul on Pancev. 
</P>
<P>
"We created a lot of opportunities," Yugoslav Coach Ivica Osim said. "But on 
the other hand we had problems in defense, where there was a lot of 
nervousness." 
</P>
<P>
Susic put the Yugoslavs, twice World Cup semifinalists, ahead after just four 
minutes. He ran down the center to meet a heavily angled cross pass from the 
right from Refik Sabanadzovic and headed home as goalkeeper Mohsin Mohamed 
Faraj jumped in vain. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, the Yugoslavs went ahead, 2-0. Pancev won the ball just 
outside the goal area after a mistake by Nasser and turned to shoot to the 
right of the diving Mohsin. 
</P>
<P>
As the Yugoslavs began to ease up, the UAE, which lost all three games in the 
group, scored a goal in the 21st minute. Adnan Khamis Talyani crossed the ball 
for Ali Thani to head past the surprised Ivkovic. 
</P>
<P>
But Ali Thani's joy did not last. He limped off, supported by two coaches, at 
halftime after injuring his left leg and was replaced by Fahad Khamis, himself 
not long recovered from a groin strain. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavs returned after the break determined to keep pressing, and within 
the first minute Pancev put them ahead, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Zlatko Vujovic crossed to the center where Pancev beat defender Khalil 
to the ball and slotted it home. 
</P>
<P>
Misfortune struck the UAE when Khalil, one of their strongest players, was sent 
off for a foul off the ball on Pancev. He had already received a yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
Khalil's absence proved costly when Prosinecki , a 79th minute substitute for 
Sabanadzovic, scored the fourth goal in injury time when he brought down a high 
crossing pass and looped the ball over the heads of the UAE defenders. 
</P>
<P>
The victory put the Yugoslavs into a second-round match against Belgium or 
Spain in Verona.

The U.S. national soccer team bowed out of the World Cup today when Austria 
recovered from losing a man ejected in the first half to battle to a 2-1 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Speedy forwards Andreas Ogris and Gerhard Rodax, two of three strikers in the 
lineup, scored goals in the second half as Austria's experience proved too much 
for a young American team in game marked by ferocious tackling and yellow 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Murray scored the second U.S. goal of the tournament when he converted a 
cross by Tab Ramos in the 82nd minute. 
</P>
<P>
Eight players were cautioned by the referee in addition to the red card given 
to Austrian Peter Artner for a nasty tackle on Peter Vermes. 
</P>
<P>
The result eliminated the United States which lost all three games in Group A, 
while Austria gave itself an outside chance of reaching the second round after 
losing its first two matches. 
</P>
<P>
The first half was marked by rugged tackling by both teams that saw five 
players given yellow cards and an Austrian ejected. 
</P>
<P>
The United States created several chances early on with John Harkes and Ramos 
controlling the midfield but failed to convert them into goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans had a goal-coring chance as early as the third minute but Vermes 
fired over the bar from close range after a free kick. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its need to score goals, Austria lacked urgency and midfielder Manfred 
Zsak received a yellow card in the 22nd minute for taking too long over a free 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
Americans Paul Caligiuri and Jimmy Banks and Pecl were also shown yellow cards 
before the interval after some untidy challenges. 
</P>
<P>
As the match became more heated, Artner was sent off by Syrian referee Jamal 
al-Sharif in the 34th minute for a vicious two-footed kick on Vermes's leg that 
left the American writhing in agony. 
</P>
<P>
However, instead taking charge of the game with a man advantage, the United 
States was forced to defend desperately as Austria stepped up the pressure and 
seized the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Ogris opened the scoring in the 51st minute when he outpaced Banks and sweeper 
Mike Windischmann in a solo run down the left and prodded the ball over Meola 
with his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Rodax increased the score to 2-0 in the 63rd minute when he stroked 
home a cross by Michael Streiter who burst down the right and cut back a pass 
that split the U.S. defense. 
</P>
<P>
The United States scored its second goal of the tournament after 82 minutes 
when Ramos ran the ball down the right into the penalty area and hooked the 
ball back for Murray to fire in a shot that struck Lindenberger's legs and 
trickled over the line. 
</P>
<P>
In the Colombia match, An 89th-minute goal by substitute Pierre Littbarski 
seemed to have sealed the game for West Germany, but Freddy Rincon charged into 
the penalty box three minutes into injury time and fired a shot underneath 
goalkeeper Bodo Illgner. 
</P>
<P>
Four players -- including three from Colombia -- were carded in one of the 
worst-tempered games of the tournament. The Colombians displayed delightfully 
flamboyant soccer skills but ruined the effect with flagrant fouls and 
theatrical play-acting when they were tackled.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Uli Derickson, a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines, became an overnight 
heroine in June, 1985, when terrorists hijacked TWA Flight 847 with 153 
passengers and crew en route from Athens to Rome. The flight was diverted to 
Beirut then Algiers then back to Beirut and then back to Algiers and finally 
back to Beirut. Most passengers were released during the ordeal, but 39 
American men held 17 days were freed June 30, 1985. Derickson argued with the 
hijackers to get humane treatment for the hostages and refused the hijackers' 
demand that she identify the Jewish passengers on board. One passenger, Robert 
Dean Stethem, 23, a Navy petty officer and diver, was murdered by the 
hijackers. In a 1985 story in People Magazine, Derickson described the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 20 minutes were the most volatile. I was in the cockpit. The flight 
crew wanted to see if we had fuel to make it to Beirut, and the hijackers said, 
"It doesn't matter. Go until the fuel runs out." And they're beating the flight 
engineer (B. Christian Zimmermann) with a gun. Every time he or the co-pilot 
(Philip Maresca) picked up a mike they beat them over the head with a gun. And 
I'm getting pretty upset by this point. I kept crying and then I stopped, and I 
kept shaking, you know, involuntarily, your nerves do funny things to your 
body. You're freezing cold and then you're awfully hot, and the hijacker said 
to me: "What are you nervous about? I told you I'm not going to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
On buying fuel in Algiers: 
</P>
<P>
 There was a lot of shouting between the ground crew and the cockpit. The 
ground crew wanted to get paid for the fuel. They are screaming for cash or a 
credit card, and the hijackers are threatening to kill one passenger every five 
minutes if we didn't get fuel. The captain turns around and says, "This is 
ridiculous." The co-pilot is bright red in the face, screaming his lungs out to 
the the ground (crew) not to be so stupid, we don't carry a charge card. So I 
ran back to the cabin and asked, "Does anyone have a credit card?" As I was 
shouting this, I said, "What's wrong with me? I've got a Shell card." So I 
asked for permission to go to my purse, and I got out my card and gave it to 
them. They put 6,000 gallons of jet fuel on my Shell credit card, about $5,500 
worth.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crowd roared as a thin, spectacled man in a blue flannel suit came through 
the pillared doorway of a downtown convention center. Flashbulbs popped, 
television lights came on, and reporters homed in with their microphones. The 
premier of Quebec, Robert Bourassa, was about to address the Canadian people. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not at all charismatic," said Montreal newspaper editor Paul-Andre 
Comeau, but that doesn't matter. Robert Bourassa isn't just any Canadian 
politician, and these aren't ordinary times north of the 49th parallel. 
</P>
<P>
The Quebec premier leads one of the country's largest provinces, with a fourth 
of the Canadian population. It's the only province where the majority speaks 
French, and now, Quebec's Francophone separatists are once again on the move. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa has opposed separatism in the past, but times change, and so may he. 
These days, when Bourassa speaks, people not only listen -- they pick apart his 
words, seeking clues to what the future may bring. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show that about half of all Quebecers now favor some sort of realignment 
with English Canada. The number has grown sharply over the past few months, as 
the country has debated whether to amend the constitution in ways that would 
give more power to Quebec. A package of amendments faces a June 23 deadline to 
either be ratified by all 10 provinces or die. 
</P>
<P>
French-speaking Quebecers feel they need the extra constitutional powers 
because they constitute a threatened minority within Canada. But many English 
Canadians think the amendments are too generous to their Francophone 
compatriots, and two provinces, Newfoundland and Manitoba, have been 
threatening not to sign them in time. 
</P>
<P>
If the amendments die, many Quebecers are likely to conclude there is little 
point in staying with English Canada. They will call on Bourassa to defend 
their province's honor, and Bourassa will have to decide how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, the constitutional amendments are ratified, 
middle-of-the-road Quebecers are likely to accept continued union with English 
Canada and go on about their business. But hard-line "nationalist" Quebecers 
will keep up the pressure on Bourassa to test the constitutional amendments in 
court, to show that they really mean something. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec nationalists will also call on Bourassa to go into talks on additional 
constitutional amendments -- some may be called this fall -- with an even 
longer wish-list for their province. Quebecers want greater powers over 
education, television and radio programming and construction of huge 
hydro-electrical dams without federal environmental interference. Bourassa will 
be damned in his own province if he doesn't take up the fight; damned in 
English Canada if he does. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa, the product of a Harvard legal education and advanced economic 
training at Oxford, is a pragmatist with all the elan and personal magnetism of 
a tax lawyer. So he is unlikely to do anything radical in either case. While 
there has been widespread speculation that the constitutional battling might 
prompt him to call a referendum on Quebec independence, those who know him best 
think he'll take a middling approach. 
</P>
<P>
"If one looks at his political career, one generally gets an impression of 
someone who avoids rash actions and tries to achieve compromise," says Kenneth 
McRoberts, a professor of political science at York University and author of a 
political history of Quebec. "He is someone who is quite cautious and concerned 
with maintaining his electoral position." 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't to say that Bourassa would do nothing. The premier is a close 
observer of public-opinion polls and bases his policy decisions in large 
measure on what he finds in the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, for instance, he tried to bridge the gulf between Quebec nationalists, 
who wanted a ban on English-language signs in the province, and minority 
English-speakers who said such restrictions would infringe on their civil 
rights. He banned the signs outdoors, authorizing their use indoors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a weird compromise," said Comeau. English and French-speakers both 
grumbled about the straddle, but they took to the streets only once over the 
issue. "He knew where the opposition was coming from and how strong it was, and 
that's why he made that compromise. He followed the direction of the polls." 
</P>
<P>
Observers who have watched Bourassa walk the linguistic balance-beam in the 
past think he'll do the same thing now, if Quebec separatism really does take 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll try to solidify popular support on some option that's midway between 
sovereignty and the status quo," said McRoberts. 
</P>
<P>
The premier knows better than most Quebec politicians what can happen to a 
leader who lets himself be swamped by public opinion. Just 14 years ago he was 
about the most despised man in all the province. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Quebec's provincial assembly had elected him premier for the first 
time; he was just 36 years old and seriously unprepared for the job. Quebecers 
ended up holding him accountable for the many problems of the time -- 
insurrection, kidnapings and even the murder of a provincial Cabinet minister 
by radical separatists; a walkout by 200,000 government employees, the biggest 
in Canadian history; runaway expenses for the 1976 Montreal Olympics; soaring 
cost overruns on an enormous hydro-electric project in northern Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
By 1976, Bourassa's government was in ruins. He called an election that year 
anyway, and his Liberal Party took its worst drubbing in a century. Bourassa 
even lost in his own constituency. Worse yet, the separatist Parti Quebecois 
won, and set about designing a medium-term strategy for achieving political 
independence. English Canadians and federalist Quebecers blamed this, too, on 
Bourassa. It looked as though the young, ambitious technocrat was finished, at 
the tender political age of 43. 
</P>
<P>
After his humiliating defeat, Bourassa moved to Belgium, another bilingual 
country, and studied the dynamics of the European Common Market at the Institut 
des Affaires Europeennes in Brussels. He reflected on Flemish-Walloon relations 
and kept office space at the local Quebec representative bureau, where he could 
keep abreast of politics back home. 
</P>
<P>
"He really had one goal: To get in touch with civil servants from the European 
Community and to get in touch with European politicians," says Comeau, who 
happened to be living in Brussels at the time. "Politics was the only thing he 
was interested in. He thinks about politics. He dreams about politics. His 
whole life revolves around politics. His main goal was to stage his comeback." 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, the Parti Quebecois government had organized a province-wide 
referendum on its proposed plan of "sovereignty-association," which would have 
established political independence from the rest of Canada but continued 
economic ties. The federal government of the time, headed by Prime Minister 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was doing whatever it could to frustrate the 
separatists. 
</P>
<P>
Trudeau, a Liberal, made stirring speeches about the need for one great nation, 
united from coast to coast. But Bourassa re-surfaced in Quebec just in time to 
make his own, unemotional, anti-separation pitch, arguing from a strictly 
economic point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa's study of the European Economic Community had convinced him that two 
separate countries couldn't share the same currency, as Quebec and English 
Canada would have done if sovereignty-association went ahead. He told Quebecers 
as much, and plumped for what he called federalisme rentable, or "profitable 
federalism." It was a simple cost-benefit analysis that claimed Quebecers got 
more from Ottawa in transfer payments and subsidies than it paid in taxes and 
that Quebec's standard of living would fall if independence were achieved. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party hierarchy may not have liked having the once-disgraced 
Bourassa around, but it couldn't ignore someone willing to travel every rough 
road in the huge province, speaking in any high-school gym or church hall where 
people would listen to a federalist line. In the end, Quebec voted against 
sovereignty-association, and Bourassa had once more ingratiated himself both 
with his party and the voting public. In 1983, he became party leader again, 
posting the biggest winning margin in Liberal history. In 1986, he once again 
became premier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an astonishing comeback," says McRoberts. "It's a bit like Richard Nixon 
losing (the gubernatorial race) in California in 1962, and then coming back and 
winning the presidency in 1968. I can't think of anyone else in Canadian 
politics who has done this." 
</P>
<P>
But however ardently Bourassa may have fought 10 years ago to keep Canada 
together, his cold-blooded vision of "profitable federalism" has left him open 
today to the suspicions of English Canadians -- and the hopes of Quebec 
nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
What if the Canadian economic picture should change and Quebecers should 
conclude that they no longer get more out of confederation than they put in? 
Some already claim this is so, thanks to a one-year-old free-trade pact between 
Canada and the United States. The free-trade agreement has encouraged the 
development of north-south business links, rather than east-west ties. 
</P>
<P>
"Bourassa is a conditional federalist," said Guy Laforest, assistant professor 
of political theory at the Universite de Laval in Quebec City. "We're all 
conditional federalists. There comes a time when, if Canada doesn't give us 
enough, well, fine. Our first priority is to Quebec."

CRITIC AT LARGE: MICHAEL CAINE SPEAKS VOLUMES ON ART AND CRAFT OF ACTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the time of Konstantin Sergeyevich Alekseyev Stanislavsky's "An Actor 
Prepares" in 1926, a book still sold and read, hundreds of volumes have been 
published on the art/craft/profession of acting. 
</P>
<P>
The advice ranges from something close to psychoanalysis self-taught and 
self-inflicted to simple adages like "Don't bump into the furniture." James 
Cagney summed it all up by suggesting that what you do is plant your feet 
solidly, look the other actor in the eye and tell the truth. The nonagenarian 
wonder, George Burns, has confirmed this in his act and in print, saying that 
honesty is the key to acting. He adds: "If you can fake that, you've got it 
made." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Caine, who almost single-handedly helped Cockney and other down-market 
accents to supplant the splendidly cultured tones of the BBC as the standard in 
British stage and screen performances, has made nearly 70 movies since "A Hill 
in Korea" in 1956. He worked in provincial theaters, in the West End and in 
television dramas until his film career took off with "Zulu" and "Alfie." He 
knows the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Caine did a one-hour BBC special on movie acting. His 
thoughts have subsequently been refined into a book, "Acting in Film" (Applause 
Books, edited by Maria Aitken, $14.95, illustrated). 
</P>
<P>
It's wonderful reading, even for those who would not dream of playing "Let's 
pretend" in front of a camera, let alone in front of a live audience. Caine's 
guidance, aimed at novices still dreaming of the big break, can also give 
hardened critics fresh insights to what it is they're seeing up there on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
Caine, as he has proved on innumerable talk shows, is sardonically funny. In 
print, he is sensible-funny. On making the most of small opportunities, he asks 
the actor to imagine doing a scene in which another character offers a cup of 
tea, and the actor's response is "Yes, please." On the face of it, pretty 
nothing. But think about it, Caine advises. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say you would have prefered coffee. The minute the other actor says 
'tea,' your eyes change because you'd really like coffee." Or maybe, Caine 
speculates, the character can't afford to offer you a drink, or thinks you're 
an alcoholic and shouldn't have a drink. Whatever. The line is still "Yes, 
please," but your eyes can make your face more than a bland mask. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll seem a maniac if everything sets you off," Caine adds, sensibly. But a 
little creative thought can lead to a more interesting performance. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Hitchcock, asked once about an actor's work, said that the actor did 
nothing well. In characteristic Hitchcock fashion, it was a compliment. He 
meant that the actor reacted well when other actors were speaking. Caine is 
very high on reacting well. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen and react," he says. "If you're thinking about your lines, you're not 
listening. Your lines should sound like spontaneous conversation, not like 
acting at all. And that comes from active listening." 
</P>
<P>
In general, says Caine, "Less is more. That's the hottest tip I can give any 
young actor. To do nothing at all can be very useful in extreme reactive 
situations." Adopt a blank look if, say, you find your wife murdered, and "The 
audience will project their own emotions on your face." 
</P>
<P>
Keep the action and the bits of business simple, Caine advises. The actor is 
going to have to repeat them endlessly, often days apart. The golf club that 
leaps from the right hand to the left hand can mean an expensive retake and 
make the actor drastically unpopular with producers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
The best acting is invisible, but it is still acting, and the best actors are 
in a sense, Caine suggests, inspired thieves. He based Frank, the alcoholic 
university lecturer in "Educating Rita," on two friends of his, one who had 
been to university (as Caine never had), the other who was famous as a 
carouser. 
</P>
<P>
"When becoming a character, you have to steal," Caine says. "You can even steal 
from other actor's characterizations, but if you do, only steal from the best. 
If you see Vivien Leigh do something, or Marlon Brando or Robert De Niro or 
Meryl Streep do something that fits your character, steal it. Because what 
you're seeing them do, they stole." 
</P>
<P>
Early in his career, critics complained that Caine appeared in too many films, 
and not always prime material either. But there was more than financial thirst 
in his decisions, Caine says. "I did as many films a year as I could, to get 
the experience," he explains in "Acting on Film." 
</P>
<P>
"Success," it may surprise some to hear, "comes from doing, not waiting, not 
negotiating, not counting lines, not weighing credits. Do it, do it, don't wait 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
Caine admits to being vain, and admits without false modesty that he is a star, 
but he says, "Movie stardom is not necessary. From my own experience, not a lot 
of it is recommended." But being a good actor is worth all it takes. 
</P>
<P>
He might one day turn to directing -- after the stardom, and he'll know when 
the time is right. "If I'm a star, I get a script and they say, 'We know it's 
about an Australian dwarf but we'll change it a bit.' If I'm on the way down, 
they'd say I was too short to play in 'The Michael Caine Story.' Maybe then 
I'll direct."

LEON REDBONE ARRIVES HERE WITH A NEW GRIPE; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONALITY: THE CANTANKEROUS SINGER, FRESHLY RILED BY A CROSS-COUNTRY TREK, 
BRINGS HIS MAVERICK BRAND OF MUSIC TO THE COACH HOUSE WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOHN PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Leon Redbone, who has a general distaste for airplanes, arrives in Orange 
County this week at the end of a cross-country journey in a van with just his 
road manager, his musical equipment and a stack of books. Midway through the 
excursion, from a motel in Weatherford, Okla., he called to weave a diatribe 
against modern music, the sordid states of radio and TV, artists who take 
themselves too seriously, and incompetent drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In the same low, slow near-drawl with which, for the last two decades, he has 
re-created the lost era of turn-of-the-century American music, Redbone 
suggested, among other things, that TV be used as a driver-education tool. 
</P>
<P>
"They should run public service announcements for people to get in the right 
lane," he explained indignantly. "Some people have no concept that if someone's 
behind you, there's no reason to stay in the left lane. 
</P>
<P>
"But some people just completely ignore you. They haven't a clue. They think 
you're some crazy person wanting to run them over. . . . There are all these 
people out on the road who don't know when to move over to the right lane, and 
something needs to be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
So there. 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, Redbone, who has always blazed his own artistic trail 
unapologetically, would prefer that other musicians also stay out of his path. 
</P>
<P>
"All the music I hear today is just rude, loud noises," he said, "whether it's 
country, rock 'n' roll, middle-of-the-road or whatever. It all sounds the same. 
Just this extremely loud, horrible sound. All of it has this huge drum, just 
beating it out. It's completely useless to me. You turn on the radio, and all 
you hear is drums." 
</P>
<P>
As we close in on the end of the century, Redbone remains immersed in its 
beginning. But to dismiss this mustachioed crooner in white hat and dark 
glasses as a man out of time is to miss the point of his art: 
</P>
<P>
In shunning everything deemed hip by the rest of the music world in favor of 
very unfashionable tunes from minstrel shows, ragtime and Tin Pan Alley -- 
which he performs with humor and unassuming, impeccable authenticity -- Redbone 
has fashioned a body of work that is timeless and universal. 
</P>
<P>
His fascination with the pre-jazz era most recently has led him into exhaustive 
study of one Emmett Miller, a pioneering minstrel performer of the 1920s and 
'30s. Miller's renditions of "Ghost of the St. Louis Blues" and "Right or 
Wrong" inspired Redbone to record versions on his latest album, "Sugar." He'll 
be highlighting material from "Sugar" Wednesday at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has become "almost an obsession with me," he said. "The story for all 
these years has been that there's no information available on Emmett Miller at 
all. They'd all forgotten about poor Emmett. 
</P>
<P>
"Emmett was a wonderful song stylist. He has contributed to pop music much more 
than anybody has imagined. He introduced a lot of numbers that became standards 
during the '20s, '30s and '40s. . . . Certainly, the most memorable versions of 
those songs are his recordings." 
</P>
<P>
Redbone takes issue with music historians who would maintain that minstrel 
shows were not a seminal influence on early jazz. On the contrary, Redbone 
feels that Miller was "more of a jazz musician than any jazz musician today." 
</P>
<P>
"And he wasn't even a musician," he pointed out. "He was a song stylist." 
</P>
<P>
The minstrel shows, despite their racist overtones, "influenced all the jazz 
musicians of that period," Redbone continued. "And it's interesting that very 
little is known about (them) today. Today, jazz musicians don't have a 
knowledge of where the music really came from. A lot of them believe jazz 
started in 1935, but that's not so. They sometimes even gloss over jazz in the 
'20s." 
</P>
<P>
Redbone said he is thinking about compiling his findings into a book on 
Miller's life and music. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if anyone would be interested in it," he acknowledged. "But it 
should be of great interest. It's part of our musical heritage." 
</P>
<P>
He's also toying with a few other projects, including a radio show devoted to 
the music he loves. Redbone would be host, and he would do it his way. "Just to 
play these things which sound strange to the uninitiated ear (would not get) 
the point across," he said. "I'd like to do something that is both entertaining 
and informative, so people would get some sense of what I like about this 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Redbone's voice can be heard on several television commercials. He 
rejects some artists' contention that commercials compromise a performer's 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people consider it beneath your artistic endeavor. And it can be. But I 
don't compromise myself. I don't advertise food products I wouldn't eat or 
something I wouldn't use. The main thing is I can't take myself too seriously. 
If I did, I wouldn't be doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Redbone sings Wednesday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $18.50. Information: (714) 496-8930.

Robert Reischauer has a toy skunk in his office. Lift its tail, and what do you 
see? The letters C-B-O. 
</P>
<P>
CBO -- the Congressional Budget Office -- is used to being the skunk at Capitol 
Hill's picnic. Its job is to translate the lofty dreams of lawmakers into the 
hard currency of taxing and spending. And, in these days of perennial federal 
deficits, the numbers usually don't add up. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep score," said Reischauer, who has been in his job as head of the 
Congressional Budget Office for a little longer than a year. "More often than 
not, that makes us the bad news bears." 
</P>
<P>
But, for all its nagging of Congress, the CBO is its most trusted source of 
nonpartisan analysis and reliable budget forecasts. The outspoken Reischauer, a 
49-year-old liberal economist and only the third director in the CBO's 15 years 
of existence, is determined to maintain that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I have to curb my tongue," he said. "But it's absolutely critical to 
our success that CBO be seen as having no ax to grind." 
</P>
<P>
That is especially important now that contentious budget summit negotiations 
are under way between the Democratic-dominated Congress and the 
Republican-controlled White House. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, known its for rose-tinted economic thinking, has further 
strained its credibility in recent months by being forced to admit that its 
deficit projections earlier this year were off by at least $20 billion, and 
probably closer to $50 billion. The CBO's original forecasts, in contrast, are 
proving to have been relatively close to the mark. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the CBO is riding high again after several years of waning 
influence. It lost clout in 1987 under the revised Gramm-Rudman budget law. It 
was hurt even more when an institutional and political stalemate between the 
House and Senate left it without an official director for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
"CBO's credibility was never low, just its influence," said Stanley Collender, 
a longtime budget analyst who is at the Price Waterhouse accounting firm. "Bob 
has helped bring it back as a player." 
</P>
<P>
Reischauer, a graduate of Harvard with a doctorate in economics from Columbia 
and the son of Edwin O. Reischauer, famed Japanese scholar and former U.S. 
ambassador to Japan, seems to have been born to be CBO director. He was present 
at its creation, signing on as its first employee under Alice M. Rivlin, who 
brought him along from the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, when 
she was named the CBO's original director in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed at the CBO through 1981, rising to become deputy director. After 
that, Reischauer was a senior vice president at the Urban Institute until 
returning briefly to Brookings in 1989, before leaping back into the fray at 
the CBO. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we have found the best person for one of the most challenging 
jobs in Washington," Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) said 
at the time of Reischauer's appointment last March. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Reischauer makes a joke of his decision to return to a government 
post. "My wife says I keep celebrating my mid-life crises by taking big pay 
cuts." The CBO director receives a salary of $89,000. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with a playful and self-deprecating wit, Reischauer works well with 
both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. He has managed to repair much 
of the damage done to the CBO's prestige during the period when it lacked a 
director and was forced to rely on acting officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't hard," he cracked. "Compared to nobody, I'd have to be at least a 
little bit of an improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Reischauer acknowledged that his colorful personality, helpful as it may be to 
restoring the CBO's high profile, also has gotten him in hot water on occasion. 
Earlier this year, on the day after President Bush's budget was released, he 
was quoted prominently as saying: "It's a 'Play It Again, Sam' budget. We've 
seen this before." 
</P>
<P>
"I heard from members about that," he said. "It was perceived as partisan. I 
didn't mean it in a partisan sense, but I've learned how careful you have to be 
in this job." 
</P>
<P>
And Reischauer can't imagine doing anything else right now. "For someone who 
cares about policy analysis, this has it all . . . . As long as the budget is 
the name of the game, I've got the best seat in town."
