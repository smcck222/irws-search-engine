On her first day on the job at Loyola Marymount University, Justine Clancy 
received a million post cards. 
</P>
<P>
What Clancy inherited, as the head of the university's special collections 
section, was possibly the world's largest deposit of "wish you were heres." 
</P>
<P>
"There are about a million," she said, "though we've only catalogued one-third 
of them in the three years I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
Clancy said the Oakland Public Library previously had claimed the largest post 
card collection. That cache, however, amounts to no more than half a million. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Loyola's missives were a gift from one person, the late photographer 
Werner von Boltenstern, who also founded an international post card collectors 
group (deltiologists, they call themselves). He donated the cards in the 1960s 
with the proviso that the treasure never be broken up. 
</P>
<P>
The cards were promptly forgotten and sat in filing cabinets for two decades. 
But when Clancy came to the university, she saw them as a unique reference 
source with historic value. 
</P>
<P>
Curiosities on display include German cards dating to the early 1800s, "Wanted" 
poster/cards of bad guys in the Old West, cards made of metal and linen, even a 
78-r.p.m. Christmas recording by Rosemary Clooney that is stamped into a card 
advertising a 1956 Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Among local oldies, Clancy found a 1905 leather greeting that shows a man and 
woman sitting on a hammock with the inscription, "I'm having a fine time in Los 
Angeles." (It looks like it was a clear day.) 
</P>
<P>
Is Clancy still accepting donations? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," she said, "but, ideally, the person would also donate some cabinetry to 
hold them." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California was the birthplace of kookie automobile commercials, 
beginning with dealer Earl (Madman) Muntz, who dressed in Napoleonic hat and 
red long johns in the 1940s and shouted: "I want to give them away, but Mrs. 
Muntz won't let me. She's crazy!" 
</P>
<P>
There followed such offbeat television characters as Les ("Get off your couch 
and come on down to Hermosa Beach") Bacon, Chick Lambert with his dog Storm, 
and Cal Worthington with his non-dogs named Spot. So the employees at Glenn 
Thomas Dodge in Long Beach are only upholding tradition with their distinctly 
1980s approach. They rap-sing their television pitch. Honest. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen people phoned The Times Sunday night to report a mysterious 
aerial sight in the Encino area. "Two large bright orange lights, right next to 
each other," one caller said. "They moved away for a few seconds, then came 
back." 
</P>
<P>
No explanation yet for the spacemen who got away, as usual.

AL MARTINEZ: A GUN IN THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris tells the story like he is repeating a segment from a dream in which 
every detail remains brilliantly clear. 
</P>
<P>
He can recall seeing a movement of the pale blue curtains in his bedroom that 
day and the patterns of light and shadow created by sunlight streaming through 
a window. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers a trace of his wife's perfume in the air and the fact that their 
dog Oscar was barking in the distance. He remembers hearing a hammer pounding 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Accidents happen on just those kinds of days. Ordinary days. Days of no 
expectations. Tuesday mornings or Thursday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
We talk about it, Chris and I, because this isn't a dream he's discussing. 
</P>
<P>
He is telling me about an actual incident so chilling that it needs no 
surrounding drama to be etched in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
It was the day Tessie found her daddy's gun. 
</P>
<P>
Tessie's real name is Theresa, and she is one of those 3-year-olds who, like a 
hummingbird in flight, is never at rest. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find her climbing up a tree or trying to get to an upper shelf in the 
closet or crawling into a barrel head first with her feet sticking out. 
</P>
<P>
Tessie's mother, Della, left her alone for five minutes one day in their Santa 
Monica home while preparing for a party. She returned to the kitchen to 
discover that Tessie had painted the front of the refrigerator with clam dip 
and a basting brush. 
</P>
<P>
You get the idea. Tessie, her mother says, is into everything. Including places 
where guns are hidden. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only a moment that I didn't have my eye on her," Chris says, trying to 
assuage his immense feeling of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taking a day off because I'd hurt my back. Della was out shopping, and 
Tessie was home with me. I was putting a videotape on so she could watch 
cartoons. How long can something like that take?" 
</P>
<P>
Long enough for Tessie to scoot out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Chris went through the house calling her name, but you can call Tess forever 
and she'll ignore you. Some kids are like that. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't you answer me?" you can ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Because," they'll say. Just because. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she couldn't be far," Chris says. "I checked behind the couch where she 
likes to hide and in the bathroom where we keep the cat. Then I went into the 
master bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
He found Tessie. She had his gun in her hands. It was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Chris sees it in freeze frame, a moment isolated in time while a message is 
flashed to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tessie!" 
</P>
<P>
 She had the snub-nosed .38-caliber revolver pointed toward her, looking into 
the barrel. A tiny thumb was on the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
He would say later that the first thought that flashed through his head was How 
could this happen? 
</P>
<P>
Chris was careful about the gun. He kept it locked in a cabinet next to his 
bed. He had the only key dangling from a bracelet on his wrist. Somehow he had 
failed to lock the cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"How could I do that?" he asks in an anguished tone. "I'm the kind of guy who 
double-checks the stove at night to make sure all the burners are out. How 
could that happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Tessie!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was a question never answered. He only knew at that terrifying moment that 
his daughter, an imp with short hair and a smile like a spring morning, danced 
on the brink of eternity. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen other kids danced on that same brink in the L.A. area during the past 
year. Fourteen times guns in the house were accidentally turned on them. Four 
of them died; one is in a coma; the others are maimed for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tessie!" 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze frame ended. Chris exploded into action. In less than the time it 
takes for a leaf to fall, he had the gun away from her and Tessie in his arms. 
And he was crying. 
</P>
<P>
They were tears of relief. 
</P>
<P>
By what caprice does Tessie live and another child die? Who decides? What sets 
the standards? Chris could only guess. Tessie was OK. That's what mattered. 
</P>
<P>
There is no longer a gun in the house, and Chris wonders what he'd do if an 
intruder forced his way in. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he says. "I only know I'll never own another weapon." 
</P>
<P>
We are in his back yard watching Tessie play in the sandbox. Suddenly, for no 
apparent reason, she makes a dash for a back fence and is halfway up before 
Chris can get her down. 
</P>
<P>
He is shaking his head as he carries her back to the sandbox. Tessie is 
laughing. There is sunlight in her hair.

A CASE OF MISPLACED PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By having arranged travel to Cambodia and Vietnam, Lindblad Travel Inc. has 
been the object of heavy fines, exceeding $75,000, for violating the Foreign 
Assets Control Regulations. "I find it unjust and wrong," Lars-Eric Lindblad, 
president of the company, told the New York Times. So do we. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that there was a technical breach of the law. That is 
implicit in Lindblad's guilty plea. His license from the Treasury Department 
for travel to the two nations had expired. An undercover agent of the U.S. 
government was used to expose the unpublicized trip, arranged for Lindblad's 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
The energy devoted by the federal government to the matter is in itself 
evidence of bad judgment and misplaced priorities in Washington. The 
legislation in question is intended for the narrowest application to prevent 
transfers of assets to nations deemed in belligerent status. To use the law to 
try to bar Americans from travel anywhere is an unreasonable restriction on the 
norms of freedom which the United States affirms for all people. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of money earned by Vietnam and Cambodia for receiving the visitors 
was insignificant and could in no way affect the security of the United States. 
But the silliness of this prosecution cannot but undermine confidence in those 
responsible for implementing the rule of law.

PEPPER: MAVERICK CONGRESSMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his article "Decency and Vision Made Claude Pepper a Congressional Maverick" 
(Op-Ed Page, June 2) on the career of Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), Roger Morris 
made some very dubious statements about the late congressman's actions during 
the Cold War period. 
</P>
<P>
In defending Rep. Pepper's "courage" in withstanding American anti-Soviet 
"hysteria," Morris does not take into consideration that Pepper's defense of a 
moderate policy towards the Soviet Union came at the height of the Stalinist 
terror. 
</P>
<P>
The years immediately following World War II saw the Communist coup in 
Czechoslovakia, the show trials to crush "Titoist" deviation throughout Eastern 
Europe resulting in the torture and hanging of dozens of innocent persons, as 
well as the "doctors' plot" and the assault on intellectuals within the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
These were all controlled and masterminded by Stalin and carried out by his 
associates. In addition, there was the North Korean invasion in 1950 by a 
client state of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
I bring these incidents up to illustrate that a "moderate" and "reasonable" 
policy towards the Soviet Union advocated by Rep. Pepper and others including 
Henry Wallace was not courageous but naive in the extreme. 
</P>
<P>
Let us remember Claude Pepper for his work with Social Security and government 
aid and assistance to senior citizens not for his mistakes of 40 years 
previous.

DERSHOWITZ ON LEFTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his piece bemoaning the silence of the "extreme left" on the massacre in 
Beijing, Dershowitz uses a deceptive and irresponsible device. By condemning 
Kunstler, Chomsky and others for what they didn't say, Dershowitz is free to 
infer from their unstated positions whatever is most convenient to his thesis. 
</P>
<P>
In doing this, Dershowitz departs significantly from professional ethics. Most 
important, if a journalist phones someone for an interview -- Dershowitz had 
his assistant make the calls -- and the interviewee is not there or refuses to 
respond to the call, the writer is forced to stick to previous statements or 
other verifiable evidence. Instead, Dershowitz bases his condemnation of the 
extreme left partially on Chomsky's secretary who said, "He has no comment." 
And by dragging in the totally irrelevant fact that Chomsky once defended a 
Holocaust denier, Dershowitz's attack becomes transparently personal. 
</P>
<P>
These devices may do the trick on the Morton Downey show, but if Dershowitz 
deployed such arguments in a court of law, his opponents would rip him to 
shreds. As a professor of law he no doubt knows that, which makes his absurd 
representation of the extreme left's position on China all the more 
irresponsible.

SOCIAL SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen Walton's views are correct ("Social Security Costs to Workers," letter, 
June 6). 
</P>
<P>
I am self-employed, and this year will be 58. My wife will be 60. The lobbyists 
for us do a disservice to other working people and taxpayers in petitioning for 
more and more benefits for all the elderly, regardless of need. 
</P>
<P>
During retirement I believe we are entitled to repayment of the Social Security 
contributions we made and which were made on our behalf plus earnings. No more. 
No less. In the event of our deaths prior to becoming eligible, these funds 
belong in our estate. 
</P>
<P>
We feel obliged to pay taxes to help less fortunate people who lack individual 
Social Security account funds, personal resources, and family support. 
</P>
<P>
Like Walton, I object to paying taxes to help comfortable people be more 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Congress should restore and enhance the IRA deduction. Further -- we should not 
vote for congressmen and senators who boast: "I never voted against an increase 
in Social Security benefits."

MORNING BRIEFING: SPARKY, WHAT WAS THE FUSS? SPIKES AREN'T MADE FOR WALKIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sparky Anderson, suffering from exhaustion, was sent home to Thousand Oaks 
to rest, he presumably was tired of losing games in the American League East. 
Dave George of the Palm Beach (Fla.) Daily News offers another reason. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the Yankees who sent Sparky packing. It was Wockenfuss the Terrible. 
Wockenfuss the Vincible. Wockenfuss, the rag-armed manager of the Toledo Mud 
Hens. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing a harmless exhibition game to Class-AAA Toledo might not have been the 
last straw if not for the horrible image of 40-year-old John Wockenfuss on the 
mound, mowing down Detroit hitters with what amounted to batting practice 
meatballs. In 12 major league seasons, he caught and played first base, but 
never pitched. Yet on this torturous night in Toledo, Wockenfuss was the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
"Detroit insiders say Sparky's decline began in earnest that night. Within days 
he was unable to sleep. Tremors took hold of his hands. Doctors sent Anderson 
home a week later to rest, play golf and basically make the world go away. 
</P>
<P>
"Napoleon had his Waterloo. Sparky had his Wockenfuss." 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute: Said St. Louis Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog: "The Dodgers 
can't score like they did without Pedro Guerrero in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
When Guerrero went on the disabled list June 5 last year, the Dodgers had a 
winning percentage of .580. In his absence, the percentage was .600 until he 
returned July 29. When he was traded to St. Louis on Aug. 16, the percentage 
was .561. From there to the end of the season it was .660. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What distinction does Cy Young hold in World Series history? 
</P>
<P>
Not so Strange: Curtis Strange, with his second U.S. Open victory, made another 
two-time winner, Hale Irwin, look good. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when others were trying to decide whether Seve Ballesteros or Greg 
Norman, or some other foreigner was the best golfer on the planet, Irwin said 
after Strange won the Memorial: "Curtis is the best player in the world today." 
</P>
<P>
Add Memorial: Each year, host Jack Nicklaus honors one of the golfing greats, 
and he invited Ben Hogan to be next year's honoree. Hogan turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Sun-Times quoted Hogan as saying from Ft. Worth: "I told them I 
don't travel anymore. I thanked them for the invitation, but I asked them to 
please put it off until I was dead if they want a memorial. I don't want to be 
memorialized." 
</P>
<P>
It's all in the hands: While others were arguing whether the Boston Celtics 
needed another strong man up front or a shooting guard to replace Danny Ainge 
next season, Kevin McHale told the Boston Globe: 
</P>
<P>
"I keep telling people this league has changed in the last few years, but 
nobody's listening. The game belongs to the teams with the great ballhandlers. 
L.A. has the best there is in Magic Johnson. Look what Chicago has done since 
they put the ball in Michael Jordan's hands. Detroit has one of the best 
backcourts in the league with Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams that had great years are the ones that had guards who could 
penetrate, break down the defense and then move the ball around to the right 
people. I'd love to see us get that kind of player." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Pitching for Boston of the American League, he lost the first 
game in World Series history to Pittsburgh, 7-3. He came back to win two games 
and Boston won the best-of-nine series, five games to three. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Johan Kriek, 31, after beating Michael Chang, 17, in a grass-court 
tournament in the Netherlands, asked if they had met before: "We played once 
before in the juniors. I was in the under-18s and he was in the under-2s."

Former Philadelphia Phillie reliever Tug McGraw lined a two-run single in the 
fifth and final inning Monday to give the National League an 8-7 victory over 
the American League in the eighth annual national old-timers baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Lanier and Johnny Logan opened the bottom of the fifth with singles, 
advanced as Ed Kranepool bounced out to short, and scored when McGraw singled 
against Bobby Shantz. 
</P>
<P>
The American League had taken the lead in the top of the fifth against McGraw 
when Roy Sievers' bloop single over second scored Bill (Moose) Skowron. 
</P>
<P>
The hitting stars for the National League were former Chicago Cub Billy 
Williams, who went 2 for 3 with two runs batted in, and Dick Allen, 2 for 2 
with two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The American League was led by former Detroit Tiger catcher Bill Freehan and 
former New York Yankee Phil Linz, each with two RBIs.

SAILING: LONG BEACH RACE ATTRACTS TOP SAILORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Roberts 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not difficult to attract top sailors to an event if the organizer offers 
fair winds, efficient race management, nifty trophies and a minimum of protest 
hearings so as not to interfere with the nightly parties. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Bruce Golison has attracted 122 competitors to his fifth Audi/North 
Sails Race Week at Long Beach starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The last couple of years, Golison has had trouble keeping entries out of the 
event, holding the limit to 100 to keep it manageable. This year, with race 
management help from the Alamitos Bay Yacht Club, he lifted the ceiling and 
added a Swan class for eight of the classic racer-cruisers, luring 1970 
America's Cup defender Bill Ficker of Newport Beach out of semi-retirement to 
skipper Richard Long's Flyer, a Swan 57. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sutphen, who has been Dennis Conner's trial boat helmsman in the last few 
America's Cups, will sail another. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the event has attracted significant numbers from outside 
the immediate area -- five from San Diego, seven from Ventura-Santa Barbara, 
two from San Francisco and two from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Seven classes, aligned for Performance Handicap Racing Fleet ratings from 39 to 
174, will use two courses beyond the east end of the Long Beach breakwater. 
There will be a working man's race at 4 p.m. Friday, the first of two races 
Saturday at 11:30 a.m. and the final race Sunday at 11:30. 
</P>
<P>
There will be two new events within the event. The Audi Yacht Club Challenge is 
for three-boat teams, competing with combined scores, and the Lydia Kent 
Memorial Trophy is for family crews -- a minimum of three, including the 
skipper. 
</P>
<P>
As before, the winner of the most competitive class will get the Audi Quattro 
Trophy, which was won by Steve Flam in the fiery J-35/Schock 35 fleet last 
year. This year the Schocks outnumber the Js, 16 to 11, in the no-handicap 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
There also will be a North Sails racing clinic at 9:30 a.m. Friday and a 
Durgan/Wake electronics seminar at noon -- both at the Hyatt Edgewater Hotel 
and both free to the public. 
</P>
<P>
One disadvantage Golison has in not running his event through a yacht club is 
that he has more work to do himself. One advantage is he can run it any way he 
likes -- and the sailors seem to like the way he runs it. No marine 
professionals are allowed to steer boats, unless they own them. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest plus the last couple of years has been an alternative penalty 
system, allowing competitors to absolve themselves of fouls without enduring a 
protest hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Transpacific Yacht Race drew 50 entries, including Bob McNulty's Cal Cup 
winner Chance, a Santa Cruz 70, and the venerable Ragtime, to be sailed by 
owner Pat Farrah's son Mike and Mike Elias. The biennial race to Honolulu 
starts Friday, June 30 off Point Fermin at 1 p.m. . . . Randy Smyth and Tom 
Blackaller, each holding a victory in the Salem ProSail series for 40-foot 
catamarans, go at it again at Newport, R.I., this weekend. . . . Sailing on TV 
(ESPN): Friday, 4:30 p.m., Boating World; Saturday, 9 a.m., the "12-Meter 
Challenge" at Sydney when Dennis Conner ran aground and lost to Iain Murray; 
Monday, 5 p.m., Russ Silvestri's $50,000 victory in the Ultimate Yacht Race 
series at Corpus Christi, Tex.

PLAYA VISTA DEVELOPER TO CUT BUSINESS SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to complaints that the project was too massive, the new lead 
developer of Playa Vista, the residential and commercial development planned 
just south of Marina del Rey, announced Monday that the space designated for 
shops and offices will be reduced significantly and the number of residential 
units will be increased. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson C. Rising, who heads the development team for Maguire Thomas Partners, 
said the amount of office space will be reduced by nearly 1 million square 
feet, to about 5 million, and the amount of retail space will be reduced by 
nearly 300,000 square feet, to about 680,000. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the Westside Pavilion shopping mall at Pico Boulevard and 
Overland Avenue is about 1 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The single most important thing we can do is improve the jobs-housing balance. 
We want to create a community where people work, live and play," Rising told a 
group of about 500 community members at the Airport Marina Hotel in Westchester 
on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of residential units will rise by about 2,300, to about 
11,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes apply only to about three-quarters of the 957-acre parcel 
that was part of the estate of the late billionaire Howard Hughes. Plans for 
the remaining 209 acres are not expected to change substantially. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wildlife Habitat 
</P>
<P>
Much of the tract consists of open fields and wetlands that are home to a wide 
variety of birds. 
</P>
<P>
The changes represent a victory for residents living near the project and for 
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who defeated former Councilwoman 
Pat Russell in 1987. Russell's support for the project was widely viewed as a 
major cause of her ouster. 
</P>
<P>
As part of her campaign, Galanter said she would fight to have the project 
scaled back, even though it had already been approved in 1986 by the city and 
the state Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also includes 2,400 hotel rooms and a 40-acre marina with up to 900 
boat slips. As part of the plan, the previous lead developer, Howard Hughes 
Properties Inc., agreed to set aside 175 acres of wetlands and 41 acres of sand 
dunes and bluffs as a nature preserve. Hughes also pledged $10 million to the 
National Audubon Society to restore and maintain the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Election Sent Message 
</P>
<P>
Galanter's victory, however, signaled that the city would almost certainly seek 
to reduce the size of the development. Last August, Galanter called for a new 
environmental impact report, the preservation of a larger portion of wetlands 
and a 40% reduction in the amount of office space. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Maguire Thomas, whose other projects include the 73-story First 
Interstate World Center now under construction in downtown Los Angeles, bought 
into the project for an undisclosed sum and took over as managing partner. 
Hughes Properties, a subsidiary of Summa Corp., remains as a limited partner. 
JMB Realty Corp., which owns and built much of Century City, also purchased an 
interest in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Rising has been meeting with community groups since February to get public 
comment on what changes should be made in the project. Rising said his proposed 
changes will be turned over to designers and architects, who will develop a 
more specific, though not final, plan within about a week, Rising said. That 
plan will then be available for further public comment.

WITT CAUTIONS AGAINST CUTTING FRAUD UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The case of the foot doctor who wasn't and offered bogus cures is just one 
investigation Bill Newsome recalls. The phony podiatrist ended up in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome, in his more than five years as head of the city attorney's Consumer 
Fraud Unit, has seen everything from street scams to fraudulent packaging plans 
by Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, formed in 1973 to address citizens' complaints and those from 
regulatory agencies, receives 2,000 to 2,400 calls a month. It also faces the 
prospect of elimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Officers Sought 
</P>
<P>
The spending plan for fiscal year 1990, proposed last week by City Manager John 
Lockwood, does not include the $535,000 annual budget for the fraud unit. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts, which are intended to allow the city to hire an additional 140 police 
officers, would cut $21.8 million from an array of programs over the next two 
fiscal years, including $7.5 million in fiscal 1990. Lockwood, who has proposed 
a spending plan of $930 million for the fiscal year, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council approves eliminating the fraud unit, the city attorney's 
office would still handle consumer complaints, City Atty. John Witt said. But 
it "would not be in a position to commit the resources" to consumer affairs the 
way the unit does, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If choosing between a drunk-driving case and a consumer complaint, the 
drunk-driving case would receive priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes Across-the-Board Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Witt said he is opposed to across-the-board cuts in his department because it 
might affect resources for prosecuting violent crimes. If cutbacks in the city 
attorney's office are necessary, Witt said, he would prefer that individual 
programs be cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt (the Consumer Fraud Unit) was a valuable program -- it keeps 
the marketplace free. But, while consumer protection is an important aspect, 
when you get down to making a judgment call, you have to go with crimes of 
violence," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer protection unit also investigates unlicensed contractors and 
medical services, and violations of the sanitary code. The three attorneys and 
three investigators assigned to the unit would likely be absorbed elsewhere in 
the department, Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
The unit currently handles civil and criminal consumer fraud cases. If it is 
eliminated, the city attorney's office would probably pursue only criminal 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
In civil matters, the consumer would be "left to his own devices," Witt said, 
even though a civil matter is "usually not feasible for most people." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the unit, combined with the low priority that would likely be 
assigned to consumer complaints, leaves one message if the cuts are approved, 
Witt said: "Buyer beware." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, that might not be enough, said Newsome. Statements on packages 
that list weight, volume or unit count are sometimes false, intentionally or 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these packages are shipped all over the United States, and the 
consumer is not getting what he pays for," Newsome said. "The only way to find 
out is to bring a scale in there. You don't carry a scale with you when you go 
to the grocery store. The courts have ruled that consumers should not be 
required to bring in scales." 
</P>
<P>
The stiff penalties that the unit can impose on violators are also a source of 
revenue for city coffers, Newsome said. About 50 to 100 cases annually result 
in settlements. In 1988, about $420,000 in fines and penalties were assessed, 
not including restitution paid to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Come a Long Way 
</P>
<P>
"We literally put the money back in their pocket," Newsome said. "We also 
monitor people to make sure the money is paid back. I've got cases 10 years old 
that are still getting money back" to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
The unit has come a long way since its inception in 1973. In those days, it 
consisted of one attorney equipped with a telephone. Today the unit's 
investigators do their own police work and go undercover to corroborate 
consumer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
As the number of commercial enterprises and the area's population have 
increased, so has the caseload, Newsome said, who also stressed the deterrent 
value of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Word will get out in the industries that a case has been prosecuted. The 
deterrent value is immeasurable. Within certain industries, there is an 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
In one recent suit, three grocery chains settled false-advertising cases 
brought jointly by the San Diego Consumer Fraud Unit and the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office for ads offering "unlimited double coupons." The 
settlement June 9 stipulated that the stores -- Ralphs Grocery Company, Alpha 
Beta Company and Safeway Stores -- without admitting wrongdoing, are 
permanently barred from using the word unlimited in advertisements when the 
service is actually limited. The stores paid fines of about $32,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome said the program is also a benefit to legitimate businesses because it 
prevents unfair competition. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Ed Struiksma said he hopes the council will recognize the value 
of the program to the public and not make an issue of whether or not it 
generates revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that it provides people the last line of support against unscrupulous 
business practices," Struiksma said. "I'm hopeful that the council doesn't cut 
it, period." 
</P>
<P>
The council will hear budget arguments Thursday.

GANG MEMBER SENTENCED FOR KILLING CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS and EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South-Central Los Angeles gang member was sentenced Monday to a term of 17 
years to life for the playground shooting death of a 9-year-old boy who was 
caught in a gunfight between rival gang factions. 
</P>
<P>
The June 24, 1987, death of DeAndre Brown, who was playing in a sandbox at Mt. 
Carmel Park at 70th and Hoover streets, caused such widespread community 
outrage that several witnesses came forward and identified Damon Thompson, then 
17, as the triggerman. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the continual gang activity in the wake of the shooting prompted 
some to initiate a campaign to rename the park for the dead boy. 
</P>
<P>
So when word spread of the sentence imposed Monday against Thompson -- just 
five days short of the second anniversary of the shooting -- residents of the 
neighborhood rejoiced. 
</P>
<P>
"Great! He deserved it," said the dead boy's foster mother, Shirley Dorsey. 
"Maybe this will stop the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
One staffer at Loren Miller Elementary School, where the victim was a 
fourth-grader, added: "This is one killing that no one's forgotten. We still 
remember the boy fondly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acrimonious Debate 
</P>
<P>
The boy's death even figured in the sometimes acrimonious debate over the 
Police Department's war with street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, South-Central Los Angeles community and political leaders 
decried the attention, and police manpower, directed to the gang-related 
shooting death of college student Karen Toshima in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
While the Police Department marshaled 30 detectives to track down the Alhambra 
woman's killer, the community leaders wondered why similar resources were not 
assigned to the repeated incidents of gang violence in some of the city's 
poorest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a suspected gang member, Durrel DeWitt Collins, was arrested on 
suspicion of murder in the death of Toshima, who was a student at Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rival Gangs 
</P>
<P>
In refuting arguments from some black activists, police officials pointed out 
that a task force of detectives, aided by tips from area residents, arrested 
Thompson about 12 hours after DeAndre was gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
Although the park itself has had few gang-related problems, it is in an area 
contested by two rival gangs, the Menlo Gangster Crips and the Hoover Crips, 
area residents said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the shooting of DeAndre Brown told police that several members of 
the Menlo Gangster Crips, including Thompson, walked to a corner of the park 
and fired through a chain-link fence at several Hoover Crips members, who 
returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster, who was more than 100 yards away, was struck in the neck by a 
single bullet and died half an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, now 19, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder earlier this year, 
court officials said. Under the sentence imposed Monday by Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Marsha N. Revel, Thompson was remanded to the custody of the 
California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resentencing Possible 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Shapiro, said Thompson could serve up 
to seven years in the CYA. 
</P>
<P>
If Thompson proves troublesome during that time, CYA authorities could send him 
back to court for resentencing. Then, he presumably could be sent to state 
prison to serve the reminder of his 17-years-to-life sentence, Shapiro said.

CCDC WARNS CITY OF TARNISHED IMAGE IN $2-MILLION BAILOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reluctant Centre City Development Corp., the agency in charge of downtown 
redevelopment, agreed Monday to help the city of San Diego out of its budget 
shortfall by accelerating its loan payments by $2 million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
But in doing so, directors of the nonprofit corporation warned that the city 
risks tampering with the image of downtown on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
A perception that the City Council intends to continually dip into 
redevelopment funds could potentially drive away investors, lenders and bond 
holders, who form the crucial financial foundation behind downtown's 
revitalization, according to the board. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Patrick Kruer said he is worried that private financial backers of 
redevelopment projects will grow wary of investing in downtown if they believe 
redevelopment funds can be used as a "slush fund" to bail out the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We can send the message we think it's a mistake" to draw on CCDC funds, said 
board president John G. Davies, who stressed that the $2 million should be 
viewed as a one-time expenditure to help alleviate a budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Part of a City' 
</P>
<P>
While there was unanimous agreement among the seven board members about the 
bail-out money, member Janay Kruger said it's important to note that 
redevelopment is part of the city and shares its problems. "We are part of a 
city that is in trouble," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Only last week the City Council, groping for ways to pay for a larger police 
force and solve its budget woes, raised the possibility of demanding early 
repayment of about $65 million in loans advanced over the last two decades to 
CCDC, the redevelopment agency it created to oversee downtown's rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council wants to add 140 officers to the police force during the 
coming fiscal year, at a cost of $7.5 million, plus another $14.3 million the 
following year. Additionally, the proposal includes construction of two new 
police substations, at a two-year cost of $14.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Lockwood has proposed deep and wide-ranging budget cuts -- 
including elimination of the city's after-school recreation program and 
abolishment of the city attorney's fraud unit -- to help fund the hiring of 
more police. 
</P>
<P>
It was with that backdrop the CCDC board of directors met in special session 
Monday to consider the City Council's demand to seek early repayment of its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to Pay Debts 
</P>
<P>
Under a previous agreement between CCDC and the city, the redevelopment entity 
was scheduled to begin paying back its debts in the fiscal year 1992. The CCDC 
staff, led by its top administrator, Pamela Hamilton, recommended accelerating 
that schedule by two years, starting in the 1990 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined by Hamilton, the agency would pay the city $1 million in 1990 and 
another $1 million in 1991, and then make payments as originally scheduled, 
which includes an increase to $3 million in 1994. Much of that latter money is 
earmarked to help the city plan for its new civic center in Centre City East, 
and Hamilton warned that any tampering with that amount or any new financial 
demands placed on the agency by the city would have a negative impact on 
financing for the new City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The board of directors -- all of whom are appointed by the City Council, which 
under state law actually serves as the redevelopment agency -- recommended cuts 
in CCDC's 1990 budget of $1.175 million. (It made no specific decisions on 
reductions to the agency's 1991 budget.) 
</P>
<P>
The reductions, which the City Council will discuss at a budget workshop on 
Thursday, are not in major programs. For example, $600,000 would come from 
money set aside to improve Broadway by adding banners to the light poles, as 
well as improving the light standards themselves and median dividers on the 
heavily traveled thoroughfare and replacing the sidewalk in front of the 
Spreckels Building at 121 Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the cutbacks would be $250,000 set aside for a new sidewalk 
outside the YMCA on Broadway; $200,000 budgeted for negotiations with Santa Fe 
Realty, and $125,000 CCDC hopes San Diego Gas &amp; Electric will pick up for 
other sidewalk improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton had suggested the agency turn over $800,000 budgeted for curbs, 
gutters, sidewalks, street lights and trees in the Gaslamp Quarter, but the 
board decided against that, saying redevelopment of the Gaslamp, which has 
limped along for years, should remain a priority. 
</P>
<P>
While the recommended cutbacks are minor in scope, the directors were worried 
that the perception may be worse than the reality. "We don't want to give the 
impression we're changing courses," Kruer said. Davies said one possible 
long-term ramification could be lower bond ratings for CCDC, which would mean 
paying higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Verge of Expansion 
</P>
<P>
Board member Tom Carter said that, for all of downtown's recent success, 
redevelopment is not done yet and that, in fact, CCDC is on the verge of a 
major expansion into other areas of downtown. He also said the city was hurting 
itself by tapping into redevelopment funds because the city receives many more 
dollars from private investors downtown than the city puts in, a technique 
known as leveraging. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Manager Maureen Stapleton said the City Council hadn't specified 
exactly how much it wanted from CCDC, and that it's up to the council to decide 
whether to accept CCDC's recommendation or alter it. 
</P>
<P>
There were questions raised last week about whether the city could use revenue 
derived from CCDC because some it came from federal grants and included 
restrictions of how it could be spent. But Stapleton said the $1.175 million 
suggested by CCDC could be used for either the hiring of new police officers or 
for construction of the substations.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RAW SEWAGE SPILLS INTO STREET, RIVERBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 gallons of raw sewage spilled into the streets of a Santa 
Clarita Valley neighborhood and flowed into a nearby dry riverbed after 
construction materials clogged a major sewer line Sunday night, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage backup occurred in the area of Santa Clara Street and Honby Avenue 
about 8 p.m. when a 21-inch underground pipe became clogged by chunks of 
concrete and rock. The untreated sewage flowed into the intersection of the 
streets and drained into a ditch before settling in the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
It took crews more than four hours to get the line flowing again, and the 
cleanup took until Monday afternoon. After the cleanup, authorities said there 
appeared to be no environmental or health hazard.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ST. JOSEPH LEAVES TRAUMA CARE SETUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank withdrew from Los Angeles County's trauma 
network Monday, leaving officials from nearby hospitals fearing an increase in 
the number of critically ill patients they must treat. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not adding any more staff to handle the expected increase, but 
psychologically we're gearing up," said John McConnellogue, director of 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center's emergency department. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph officials announced in April that they were dropping out of the 
network because of a lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We will no longer have a general surgeon on duty 24 hours a day like before," 
a St. Joseph spokeswoman said. "But we will still have a full basic emergency 
department." 
</P>
<P>
Ten of 23 hospitals have dropped out of the county's trauma care network since 
it was formed in 1984.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WITH BB GUN SHOT BY DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies opened fire on a suspected drunken man in Bellflower who 
pointed a BB gun at them outside his house, wounding him slightly with 
ricocheting bullets, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Ecchervarria, 46, treated for wounds to his left earlobe and left hand, 
was arrested on suspicion of exhibiting a firearm with intent to prevent 
detention by police, Deputy Roger Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies had been called to investigate a disturbance at Ecchervarria's house 
at 10:20 p.m. Sunday, Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
The man appeared in the doorway armed "with what appeared to be a .45-caliber 
semiautomatic pistol," Hom said. "He pointed the pistol at the deputies." 
</P>
<P>
One of the deputies fired a round but missed the gunman, who darted back into 
the house. Shortly afterward, he came back out still armed with the gun and 
assumed a "crouching, combat-style position," Hom said.

<P>
The San Diego City Council Monday placed new constraints on door-to-door 
solicitors by passing a law prohibiting soliciting from sundown to 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A council committee had endorsed the idea of prohibiting soliciting beginning 
when it gets dark -- defined legally as half an hour after sundown -- but 
Councilman Bruce Henderson urged an even tighter policy. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said many people don't want to be bothered by solicitors in the early 
evening, and that many elderly residents are frightened.

CHINESE GODDESS OF LIBERTY STATUE TO BE MOVED TO CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Public Works agreed Monday to help relocate a 23-foot-high replica 
of the Goddess of Democracy to City Hall's Spring Street entrance for three 
months, moving it from its current perch on a Civic Center footbridge. 
</P>
<P>
But officials and local artists said after the meeting they will also explore 
the idea of moving the statue -- a copy of the one destroyed by Chinese troops 
in the recent Beijing massacre -- to a more permanent home in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
"The selection of a site is a subtle choice," said Bill Laserow, former 
president of the local chapter of Artists Equity Assn., a national visual 
artists service organization. "We're lacking the equivalent of a Tien An Men 
Square here. There's no obvious site." 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-pound wood and plastic foam monument, designed by artist Tom Van 
Sant, was hastily erected by association members last Monday atop a pedestrian 
bridge linking City Hall East and the north end of the downtown mall near the 
Los Angeles Children's Museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Questions 
</P>
<P>
The statue, which was installed without city permits, raised immediate safety 
questions with police and fire officials. But the Board of Public Works, at the 
urging of officials including Councilman Michael Woo, agreed to cut through red 
tape and gave permission for the statue to remain for a week. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's meeting, the public works board insisted that the statue be moved 
so that pedestrians could again use the bridge. But board members hastened to 
add that they would continue to cooperate by allowing the statue to be moved to 
an alternate location. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-0 vote, board members agreed to move the replica, and bolt it down for 
90 days, on a landing of the Spring Street entrance to City Hall. The move, 
officials said, will take place next week after the return of Van Sant, who is 
in Washington this week to testify before a congressional committee on 
arts-related legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," said Artists Equity Assn. board member Arte Gross, after the 
vote. "Our first choice was to have it on the bridge, but how can you object to 
having it on the steps of City Hall?" 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, public works board member Dennis Nishikawa, who was asked to 
supervise the move, said that he and Equity members also will explore the idea 
next week of moving the statue to Chinatown. Talks will be held this week with 
Chinatown community leaders to gauge support and locate possible sites, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Laserow said that the makeshift statue could remain intact for up to 20 years 
if a fiberglass coating is applied. He also said that a fund-raising effort may 
be organized to raise $250,000 from government or private sources to create a 
permanent marble version of the monument.

STALKER DEFENSE STRIVES TO CREATE DOUBT ON JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense lawyers in the Night Stalker trial rested their case Monday, clinging 
to the hope that they have persuaded jurors that the wrong man is being 
prosecuted for the serial murders. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure hope so," Ray G. Clark, a lawyer for defendant Richard Ramirez, said 
when asked if he believed that the defense effort has created a reasonable 
doubt in the Los Angeles Superior Court jury's mind. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Clark and co-counsel Daniel V. Hernandez since May 9 have 
elicited much testimony regarding unidentified blood, hairs and fingerprints 
found at some of the 15 scenes of the so-called Night Stalker crimes that may 
not have belonged to either Ramirez or his alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who testified on Ramirez's behalf was his father, Julian 
Ramirez-Tapia, who said his son was in El Paso, Tex., visiting relatives at the 
time of two of the alleged attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The father's surprise testimony contradicted that of a Burbank woman, who 
identified Ramirez in court as the man who robbed and raped her May 30, 1985 -- 
a day that the suspect, according to the senior Ramirez, was in Texas. The 
Burbank woman also identified as hers pieces of jewelry taken in the predawn 
attack that police later recovered at the El Paso home of Ramirez's sister. 
</P>
<P>
Another defense witness, Sandra Hotchkiss, a convicted burglar, told the jury 
that she had committed up to 25 residential burglaries in and around Los 
Angeles with Ramirez and found him to be amateurish and nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers have also elicited testimony intended to persuade the panel 
of seven women and five men that eyewitness identifications of Ramirez had been 
made under less-than-ideal circumstances -- including the intensive news media 
coverage immediately after the suspect's arrest -- thus allowing witnesses to 
focus on Ramirez at the police lineup and subsequently in court. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one defense witness, Elizabeth F. Loftus, a University of 
Washington psychologist who studies memory and eyewitness identifications, 
testified that academic research shows that stress or extreme fright can often 
cause impairments or mistakes in eyewitness recall. 
</P>
<P>
Loftus also said cross-racial identifications are often more error-prone than 
in cases where both parties belong to the same race. (Of the eight prosecution 
witnesses who have placed Ramirez at a Night Stalker scene, three are Latinos, 
as is the suspect. The others are either Asian or Anglo.) 
</P>
<P>
Loftus conceded under cross-examination that eyewitness identifications are 
typically more accurate if a victim had more than a fleeting encounter with an 
attacker, as did several of the survivors of alleged Night Stalker attacks. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Ramirez, 29, faces 13 murder charges and 30 other felony counts -- 
including attempted murder, burglary and assorted sexual assaults -- all 
stemming from a series of brutal night-time attacks throughout Los Angeles 
County, mostly in the spring and summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Attys. Phil Halpin and Alan Yochelson said they 
plan to take about three court days in calling prosecution witnesses during the 
rebuttal phase, beginning this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The opposing lawyers are then expected to spend most, if not all, of next week 
meeting with Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan to hash out the wording of 
jury instructions. That will be a crucial phase because, according to Halpin, 
more than in any other phase of a criminal trial, unsatisfactory jury 
instructions are a major reason for appellate court reversals. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda is a long-scheduled vacation for the first full week of 
July. It thus appears that it will be July 10, at the earliest, before closing 
arguments are made and the case goes to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, which began Jan. 30, Halpin and Yochelson called 137 
witnesses. They sought to tie Ramirez to the Night Stalker crimes by presenting 
eyewitness identifications, fingerprints, shoe prints, firearms evidence and 
the defendant's own incriminating statements. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've presented a case that is clear and straightforward," Halpin 
said. "I'm satisfied."

JAIL TRUSTY ESCAPES FROM HONOR CAMP

<TEXT>
<P>
A jail trusty serving time for auto theft escaped Monday afternoon from the 
Descanso honor camp after he was granted an unsupervised visit with a female 
friend, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth H. Learned, 25, was due to have been released on probation by January. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Roger Jacobs of the Descanso jail said Learned was visiting with the woman 
about 3 p.m. when they suddenly left the site and were last seen driving away 
in a small, red foreign car. 
</P>
<P>
The companion had signed a visitor request card that listed her name as Doris 
Wendt of Escondido, Jacobs said. But when deputies searched that home later in 
the day, they did not find Wendt or Learned. 
</P>
<P>
Learned remained free Monday night.

PRECEDENT SOUGHT IN RAPE CASE; 
</P>
<P>
'GENETIC FINGERPRINTING' ON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The validity of so-called "genetic fingerprinting" went on trial here Monday as 
Orange County prosecutors sought to become the first in California to use a 
criminal suspect's genetic makeup as evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear that individuals are genetically unique," Dr. Oliver A. Ryder, 
a scientist with the San Diego Zoo, testified at a hearing on the admissibility 
of genetic evidence in criminal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
But in more than three hours of intense questioning, the defense attorney for 
Danny Harris, accused of 46 counts of rape, sexual molestation and burglary, 
sought to refute that theory by showing potential inaccuracies in the testing 
and interpretation of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was the first in Orange County to explore controversial legal 
questions surrounding genetic fingerprinting -- a new practice seen as a 
scientific boon by prosecutors and a dangerous and unreliable precedent by 
defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2nd Round of Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the Harris case are to return July 24 to begin a second round of 
testimony before Superior Court Judge William R. Froeberg. The judge ultimately 
must decide whether prosecutors can offer at Harris' upcoming trial genetic 
evidence that purportedly links the 39-year-old Buena Park man to about 18 
rapes and a series of other violent crimes around the county. 
</P>
<P>
First devised in England four years ago, the process of genetic fingerprinting 
uses samples of blood, semen or body tissue to establish an individual's 
genetic code or DNA pattern, a blueprint for all living organisms. Backers of 
the process maintain that, with the exception of identical twins, each 
individual has a unique genetic pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Genetic fingerprinting, considered by prosecutors more reliable and readily 
available than standard fingerprints in identifying perpetrators of sexual 
assaults and violent crimes, has gained only limited acceptance in a few courts 
around the nation. And it has never been allowed into evidence in California. 
</P>
<P>
But backed by a strong endorsement in January from state Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp, local prosecutors in Orange, Ventura and Alameda counties all now are 
seeking to introduce genetic evidence in pending criminal cases, according to 
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis D. Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're successful in this (Harris) case in getting (genetic fingerprinting) 
into evidence, it'll certainly make it that much easier the next time around," 
said Bauer, explaining the precedent-setting importance of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner's Department already is making plans 
to set up its own genetic fingerprinting laboratory. Only four now exist in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Tremendous Tool' 
</P>
<P>
Larry Ragle, director of forensic sciences, said Monday that the Sheriff's 
Department department has now raised about $45,000 from the private sector for 
the project. That is far short of the $200,000 needed to start the lab by the 
end of the year, but Ragle said he is hopeful that the Board of Supervisors may 
approve additional funding next month. 
</P>
<P>
"This (genetic fingerprinting) would be a tremendous tool for us to have in our 
investigations," Ragle said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, county officials face stiff opposition from some 
members of the scientific and legal defense communities who assert that 
prosecutors are trying to rush an unreliable process into action. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing in the Harris case, defense attorney John D. Barnett sought 
to show that the genetic fingerprinting process is riddled with the potential 
for erroneous results. 
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the ability of Dr. Ryder -- a vertebrate geneticist who has 
worked extensively with DNA testing in studying wildlife at the San Diego Zoo 
but is not a forensic scientist -- to testify adequately on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing Ryder's testimony, Barnett said later: "There's simply insufficient 
scientific agreement on the ability of life codes to predict matches (between a 
genetic pattern and an individual) . . . These life codes are still under 
tremendous scrutiny. And right now, there's just too big a risk to take in a 
criminal case." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Bauer acknowledged that, without the aid of the DNA evidence, he 
would be significantly hampered in trying to prove to a jury that Harris was 
responsible for a series of violent assaults in Anaheim, Fullerton, Santa Ana 
and Garden Grove dating back to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer would not elaborate on the genetic evidence in the Harris case. But 
Barnett said prosecutors have already indicated they plan to introduce semen 
specimens, which they claim conclusively tie Harris to at least five of the 18 
rapes for which he is charged.

<P>
Preservation-minded homeowners were treated to 99-cent burger specials Monday 
as they announced that a 1950s-style coffee shop next to the gas station will 
be added to their monument application when it is considered Wednesday by the 
city's Cultural Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are seeking monument status for the southeast corner of Ventura and 
Laurel Canyon boulevards as a way of preventing a developer from demolishing 
the gas station and carwash and building a $15-million mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a commission member visiting Studio City to inspect the carwash 
and gas station commented to residents that their application might be 
strengthened if it included the 28-year-old Tiny Naylor's Restaurant along with 
the automotive facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Googie' Look 
</P>
<P>
The coffee shop is built with a modernistic look known as the "Googie" style to 
preservationists. It uses angular steel beams that form wing-like exterior 
supports for the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The nearby carwash has a similar look. Residents say its three 55-foot-tall 
boomerang-shaped steel beams honor the Valley's car culture and form a fitting 
"Gateway to Studio City." 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant operators rolled back the price of hamburger-fries-and-Coke specials 
to 1963 levels Monday to help monument supporters reminisce while they filled 
Tiny Naylor's vinyl-covered booths. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, the coffee shop was one of the few restaurants in the southeastern 
Valley that was open around the clock. So it was a popular hangout for 
teen-agers growing up in the 1960s, said Jack McGrath, organizer of the 
save-the-carwash campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1960s, all the kids around here came here," agreed Sunny Gillis, 43, a 
1963 graduate of North Hollywood High School who lives in Burbank. "Coming here 
was like going to the circus or going fishing with your dad. This is where you 
fell in love, got beat up, got drunk. And all that could happen before lunch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clubs Met There 
</P>
<P>
Linda Knieps, 41, a member of North Hollywood High's class of '65, said the 
coffee shop was a favorite meeting place for social clubs that were popular on 
campus. "I was a member of the Chanteclair's. It was the most fun to come here 
after football games or club meetings. I was really upset when I heard that a 
mini-mall might be built here. We don't have enough nostalgic landmarks left." 
</P>
<P>
Tiny Naylor's officials -- who served about 300 hamburger plates during a 
90-minute period Monday -- pledged to spend $75,000 to restore the coffee shop 
to its 1960s splendor if commissioners make the restaurant a monument. A 
cultural designation would prevent developer Ira Smedra from demolishing the 
corner for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"You remember the counter and the tile and the soda jerks? That's what we'll 
bring back," Randy Peters, the restaurant chain's chief operating officer, told 
reporters -- including a Voice of America broadcaster preparing a report for 
European listeners. 
</P>
<P>
The old-fashioned look won't apply to the menu, however. A hamburger, fries and 
a Coke will cost $4.50, officials said.

PARAMEDICS GET LIFESAVING DEVICE; 
</P>
<P>
2 FIREFIGHTERS WIN BATTLE FOR USE OF BLOOD-SUGAR METER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a six-month effort, two Carlsbad firefighters have won approval from 
emergency medical authorities to require all county paramedics to carry a 
pocket-size device that could help save lives. 
</P>
<P>
The device, a small meter that measures blood-sugar levels, will provide vital 
information to paramedics in the field -- especially those treating unconscious 
stroke victims or diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kinkade and Chris Heiser, who are also paramedics for the Carlsbad Fire 
Department, recently won the approval from the San Diego County Emergency 
Medical Services advisory committee, which helps set medical care protocol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick, Accurate Diagnoses 
</P>
<P>
Guidelines that Kinkade and Heiser have written to instruct paramedics on the 
meter's use will be submitted to the advisory committee today. 
</P>
<P>
Once the guidelines are incorporated into the protocol in early September, all 
county paramedics will be required to use the meter. 
</P>
<P>
Kinkade said the device should prove most valuable in helping paramedics make 
quick, accurate diagnoses for stroke victims or diabetics in emergency 
situations, whose survival often depends on fast treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Determining whether a person is unconscious as a result of low blood sugar -- 
as in the case of a diabetic -- or is suffering a stroke can be difficult for 
paramedics, because symptoms for both can be nearly identical, Kinkade said. 
</P>
<P>
But treating the cases identically, as protocol currently dictates, can have 
grave consequences, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Administering dextrose, a form of glucose, can quickly resolve the diabetic's 
problem, but recent studies have shown that such treatment can cause brain 
damage in the stroke victim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Eliminate Guesswork 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, failing to raise a diabetic's low blood sugar level could 
lead to a coma. 
</P>
<P>
The meter should take the guessing out of the diagnostic process, Kinkade said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, protocol demands that we give dextrose to a patient without knowing 
whether the person is suffering from a stroke or hypoglycemia," Kinkade said. 
"We're doing this while there are studies suggesting that, in a stroke patient, 
a glucose solution can cause brain damage and may increase the mortality rate 
of that patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you that this will save X many number of lives," Kinkade said. 
"But it's so easy to use, it costs about $2 a test. . . . There's really no 
reason not to use them." 
</P>
<P>
Although pleased that paramedics will soon be using the meters, Kinkade, as 
well as members of the diabetes community, question whether the six-month 
effort to win approval was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The meter has been widely employed by diabetics for more than five years to 
monitor blood-sugar levels and by hospitals nationwide. Paramedics in Orange 
and Riverside counties are already using the meter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Month Test Period 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee required the Carlsbad paramedics to conduct a two-month 
pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
During the test period between March and May, paramedics measured patients' 
blood-sugar levels by using the meter and compared the results to those from 
traditional hospital laboratory equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Kinkade said that on a rating scale that considered 1.00 perfect (meter and lab 
results matched in every test case), the two types of meters that were tested 
scored well: .83 and .81. 
</P>
<P>
"That may not be perfect, but right now we're just guessing and hoping that 
we're right," Kinkade said. "The meter, added to our training and other 
assessment tools, improves our diagnostic ability greatly." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the county's paramedic units will be responsible for purchasing the 
$130 device and a supply of meter strips. (A box of 50 costs $25.) They may 
charge a fee to the patient who is treated with the meter, Kinkade said.

MONITOR GETS BOOST FROM BUSH'S STAND ON POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the mid-1980s, the U.S. market for Monitor Technologies' air-pollution 
monitoring equipment deteriorated so severely that the San Diego-based company 
was forced to actively pursue foreign sales in Europe and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
But prospects for U.S. sales during the 1990s picked up dramatically last week 
when the Bush Administration carried through on a campaign pledge by promising 
to enact new environmental legislation. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bush Administration's environmental initiative results in tougher 
pollution controls, then Monitor will be "a company with the right product at 
the right price at the right time," according to Larry Selwitz an industry 
analyst with Newport Beach-based Cruttenden &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting for Controls 
</P>
<P>
Bush's promise to address acid rain and the growing problem of urban pollutants 
that create smog was good news for Monitor, according to Irving Katz, director 
of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. "Monitor has always been 
waiting" for increased pollution control spending to occur, Katz said. "It 
looks like finally it's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
But despite Bush's promise to institute stricter pollution controls, foreign 
sales will, for the foreseeable future, continue to generate a majority of 
Monitor's revenue during coming years. Europe and the Far East accounted for 
nearly 80% of Monitor's $11.1 million in 1988 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The worldwide market for pollution-monitoring equipment hit about $450 million 
during 1988, according to the McIlvaine Co., a Chicago-based company. However, 
the market will grow to $700 million by 1993, with more than 50% of the 
monitoring market occuring in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's environmental message -- if it results in new 
environmental legislation -- will benefit Monitor and its competitors, 
according to Robert McIlvaine, who tracks environmental spending. Bush's 
proposed acid rain controls, for example, "will mean (the addition of) a 
substantial amount of monitoring equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Monitor won't experience "a big spurt in revenue" because of increased global 
concern about pollution, but it will "enjoy good consistent growth in the 10% 
to 15% range," Selwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor reported $282,366 in net income and $3.2 million in revenue for the 
first quarter ended March 31. It reported $253,221 in net income and $3.2 
million in revenue for the like quarter a year earlier. However, last year's 
first quarter net income was bolstered by a $70,752 extraordinary item. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor's stock, which just months ago traded as low as $4, closed down 37.5 
cents on Monday at $7.375. The company's stock recently hit a 52-week high of 
$8.125. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury Asset Management Group Ltd., a British investment company, recently 
acquired a 5.2% stake in Monitor. The British company bought 95,000 shares 
between May 2 and May 9 at prices ranging from $4.87 to $5.38, according to a 
Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The purchases were made as an 
investment, and Mercury might acquire additional shares, according to the 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth E. Years on Monday suggested that 
Mercury's investment was part of the growing, worldwide awareness that mankind 
cannot continue to ignore environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
To Years, that growing awareness was underscored by British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's recent statement that environmental affairs are one of the 
"great challenges" of the coming decade. That statement was a bold departure 
for Thatcher, who has largely ignored environmental affairs during her eight 
years in office, Years said. 
</P>
<P>
But Years described Thatcher's newly found environmental awareness as only the 
first level of a three-tier process that must be completed before the English 
market for Monitor's automated pollution-monitoring equipment expands. 
</P>
<P>
"The rhetoric has to be there," Years said, "But, as important, laws have to be 
passed and then those laws have to be enforced." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, while Years welcomed Thatcher's environmental fervor, he doesn't 
expect the British market to grow until laws are passed and British regulators 
force companies to spend money on cleaning up the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts tend to agree with Years' analysis. "There is a growing awareness of 
acid rain, the greenhouse effect and depletion of the ozone layer," Selwitz 
said. "But Monitor's dilemma over the past few years has been that the funding 
just hasn't been available to do the monitoring and clean-up." 
</P>
<P>
Monitor is tracking the three-tiered environmental process in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
In Germany -- one of Monitor's most important markets -- politicians moved 
beyond rhetoric several years ago when they passed strict laws that call for 
monitoring equipment to be installed on some 10,000 industrial smokestacks. But 
Germany's environmental agency has not yet begun to enforce those environmental 
regulations, in large part because they would make German products more 
expensive than those in neighboring countries where pollution controls are not 
yet mandated. 
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, however, government officials are committed to enforcing the 
country's strict pollution-control measures. The Taiwanese government has 
mandated that spending for environmental controls equal 2% of the country's 
gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
The lapel pin that Years wears underscores the importance of Taiwan to Monitor: 
The colorful pin bears the symbol of Taiwan's environmental affairs agency, 
which recently was elevated to a cabinet-level position. "It's happening in 
Taiwan," Years said. "It's not just rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
Monitor's dependence upon foreign sales was not an accidental development. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market for environmental monitoring equipment was "largely dormant" 
during the Reagan Administration, according to Paul F. Stenberg, Monitor's 
air-quality market manager. That sales lull was caused by the "hands-off" 
policy that the Reagan Administration adopted when it came to increased 
regulation of business. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, U.S. companies -- including the utilities and petrochemical 
companies that buy the bulk of pollution-control equipment -- simply didn't 
build a lot of new plants during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Monitor turned to other nations that were beginning to adopt 
stricter environmental controls. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor has largely recovered from an aborted entry into the automated visual 
inspection equipment industry. Monitor in 1985 envisioned the automated 
inspection market as a way to augment its flagging pollution-monitor business. 
</P>
<P>
However, in August, 1986, Monitor discontinued the automation business, and it 
since has recorded a $2.2-million provision to cover costs of disposing of the 
inspection product line. The division was dissolved in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become strong again," Years said Monday. "We've kept our nose to the 
grindstone."

TAKING GASLAMP DESIGN TO NEW HEIGHTS? SOME HOPE NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dispute between city planners and Gaslamp Quarter property owners over height 
limits in the historic downtown district is fast approaching a City Council 
showdown, with the character of the zone's future development very much in the 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the issue lies in the 60-foot height limit -- with an extra 15 feet 
allowable under certain conditions -- that the city wants to keep in place for 
the 16 1/2-block district that straddles 5th Avenue from Broadway to Harbor 
Drive. Backers say the height limit is essential to preserve the character of 
the Gaslamp, where 81 of 90 buildings are 60 feet high or shorter. 
</P>
<P>
The Centre City Development Corp., the city's redevelopment agency; the city 
Planning Department, and the Historical Site Board, a citizens advisory group 
on matters of historic preservation, all back the 60-foot limit. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is whether or not we are going to respect the historic character of 
the district and live up to our own policy direction," said senior city Planner 
Ron Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposing side is the Gaslamp Quarter Council, a group that includes 200 
business and property owners. The group has proposed an amendment to the 
ordinance that would allow certain projects to include "tower elements" of 
heights up to 125 feet, set back from the street to accommodate hotel, 
apartment or condominium development, said Craig Lee, executive director of the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the Gaslamp Quarter Council proposal, the 60-foot limit would be 
observed in all new Gaslamp development except in projects south of Island 
Street and on parcels of half a block or more in size. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said that taller heights are appropriate on 5th Avenue south of Island 
because the area contains few buildings of historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels and residential towers would generate more foot traffic in the quarter, 
he added, bringing more business to Gaslamp shop owners while discouraging 
panhandlers and homeless people from congregating. 
</P>
<P>
"We need flexibility to bring special projects into the quarter," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to vote next month on the proposed ordinance 
amendment. The opposing sides concede that some kind of amendment is needed 
because the existing law allows the city planning director to grant exemptions 
to the height limitations at his discretion, without specifying how much and 
under what circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's vote will directly affect three proposed projects that would 
exceed existing height limits. The farthest down the planning pipeline is the 
Brunswig Square Project, planned for the full block bounded by 5th and 6th 
avenues and J and K streets. Principals Ed Murphy, Michael Farres and architect 
Bruce Dammann hope to build a 300-room, 13-story hotel on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The taller height is necessary, Dammann said, so the $28-million hotel project 
can compete in the "view-oriented" hotel market. 
</P>
<P>
Another project, a 200-foot-high condominium tower, is being developed by Neil 
Senturia for property bounded by 4th and 5th avenues, the Santa Fe Railroad 
tracks and K Street. Senturia is also developing the twin-tower One Harbor 
Drive condo project for a site nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Wolfsheimer, a San Diego attorney who represents Senturia, said the 
Gaslamp area may die economically "unless we do something to attract more 
people to the quarter. . . . This property, located just across Harbor Drive 
from the 120-foot San Diego Convention Center (now under construction) needs 
some height to attract people to live down there. We think it might be the 
catalyst to get Gaslamp moving." 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the 12-story Horton Park Plaza hotel on 5th Avenue at E Street, a 
75-year-old building formerly known as the Jewelers' Exchange, have proposed 
building a second tower of equal height on an adjacent lot. 
</P>
<P>
Lee argues that judicious exceptions to the height limit should be allowed if 
for no other reason than the fact that a handful of the historic buildings in 
the area, such as the Horton Park Plaza and the St. James Hotel, already exceed 
the cap. 
</P>
<P>
Planner Buckley disagreed, saying the tall buildings in the Gaslamp are 
"historical aberrations" and should not be used to justify new construction of 
tall buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The district was created to preserve the unique character and scale of 
Gaslamp, and if you start making exceptions, you jeopardize that," he said.

ESCROW FIRM'S CUSTOMERS GET A PORTION OF SEIZED FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months after state officials seized an Encino escrow firm, the Escrow 
Shoppe, and froze $5.5 million of customers' money, the customers are finally 
getting their money back -- but not all of it. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Russell A. Greenwood, a court-appointed receiver looking into the 
Escrow Shoppe's books, unfroze most of the money but withheld 10% of each 
customer's amount. Why? Judy L. Hartley, a senior lawyer with the state 
Department of Corporations, which licenses escrow firms, said up to $450,000 of 
the money might still be missing. 
</P>
<P>
The Escrow Shoppe had about 350 pending transactions when it was seized. 
</P>
<P>
One customer, David Fein, said he was glad that he was finally getting his 
cash, but was annoyed that 10% of his money is still being withheld because of 
continuing confusion over the Escrow Shoppe mess. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think by now it should be cleared up whether there are missing funds 
or not," said Fein, who had sold his house in Woodland Hills just as the Escrow 
Shoppe was seized, and whose five-figure profit on the sale was frozen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holding Money 
</P>
<P>
Escrow firms such as the Escrow Shoppe help ensure that buyers and sellers of 
real estate meet certain conditions, such as obtaining a title search, and hold 
documents and cash transferred between the parties until the sale is completed. 
</P>
<P>
When the Department of Corporations seized the Escrow Shoppe in mid-March, it 
alleged that the firm made $3 million in unauthorized payments and that about 
$200,000 of customers' funds might be missing. The agency alleged, among other 
things, that the firm had shifted money from some pending escrows to pay 
customers closing other escrows -- all without authorization by the customers. 
</P>
<P>
The state also froze the customers' money to get an accurate accounting of the 
Escrow Shoppe's assets. 
</P>
<P>
But as the state probe continued, the customers grew furious. With their money 
frozen, they could not complete their transactions unless they put up more 
money. Their financial and housing plans were thrown into chaos, and 
authorities could not predict when the money would become available. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley said 10% of the customers' money was still being withheld "to cover 
possible shortages," but said she had no additional details. Susan Allison, a 
lawyer for Greenwood's office, would say only that "we have to pursue what are 
some unexplained transactions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Criminal Action 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Bianco is the owner of the Escrow Shoppe and one of her attorneys, 
Thomas Warden, said he was aware of the state's concern about the possible 
shortages, but that he had no details. He also noted that there is no criminal 
action pending against Bianco, nor is she facing any formal proceedings by the 
Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
However, the indications of further shortages appear to be at least partially 
related to a civil suit filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles by a real estate 
partnership named Los Angeles Martinique Investments. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Martinique filed its suit May 1 against the Escrow Shoppe, Bianco 
and another firm owned by Bianco named Encino Equity Services. 
</P>
<P>
Encino Equity is a so-called "accomodator" firm used in commercial real estate 
deals. Specifically, when a group wants to sell one property at a profit, and 
reinvest that profit in another property without having to pay taxes on the 
profit in the meantime, it must use an accomodator to hold the profit as a 
third party until the money is reinvested. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Los Angeles Martinique pursued just such a deal. According 
to its suit, the partnership sold a Hollywood apartment complex in February for 
a $451,000 profit, using the Escrow Shoppe as its escrow firm. Then it turned 
over the profit to Encino Equity -- which had been recommended by the Escrow 
Shoppe -- as its accomodator, as it searched for a new property in which to 
invest the funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apartment Purchase 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, it found a new apartment building to buy, and asked Encino Equity 
to deposit the partnership's $451,000 for its purchase of the new property. But 
Encino Equity never turned over the money, the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, on March 20, the Department of Corporations seized the Escrow 
Shoppe. The partnership's lawsuit accuses the defendants of fraud, breach of 
contract and negligence, among other things, and asserts that the Escrow Shoppe 
and Encino Equities were insolvent and that the defendants' "secret intent" was 
not to complete the transaction, "but rather to close both businesses and to 
retain the sale proceeds for their own use." 
</P>
<P>
The two firms, Bianco and the other defendants denied the suit's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Martinique is not among the Escrow Shoppe customers getting 90% of 
its money back. Why? Los Angeles Martinique's attorney Howard Grady explained 
that technically it was out of escrow, it had closed the sale of the first 
apartment building, and its money was not part of the $5.5 million in the 
Escrow Shoppe's trust fund that was frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the major players in the Escrow Shoppe mess are spreading the blame 
for why the customers' money had to remain frozen for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley of the Department of Corporations said her agency had to go to court to 
get the necessary records because of delays by the Escrow Shoppe, Encino Equity 
and their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
But Warden said his people cooperated, that the state's court action was 
unnecessary and that the delay was caused by the receiver Greenwood, who was 
"very slow in doing his accounting." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Moore, president of Townsgate Escrow in Thousand Oaks, which took over most 
of the Escrow Shoppe's pending deals at the state's request, said the Escrow 
Shoppe deserves some of the blame. He said their files "were horrible . . . 
they were in all kinds of disarray," which made checking their accuracy more 
difficult.

PACOIMA FIRM FINDS ITS NICHE IN AIRPLANE MOCK-UPS FOR FILM AND TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Alfred Hitchcock's 1966 thriller "Torn Curtain," Alf Jacobsen plays a ship 
steward delivering a radiogram to scientist Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes into the movie, Jacobsen disturbs Newman and his fiancee, played 
by Julie Andrews, in their cabin with a knock on the door and hands Newman a 
slip of paper with a mysterious message on it. One minute and 10 words later, 
Jacobsen's part ends. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen, who acted under the name Burt Brandon, gets a lot more movie action 
these days. Airline Film &amp; TV Promotions, a Pacoima company he owns with 
partner Byron W. Schmidt, is Hollywood's main non-studio provider of mock-ups 
of 747s, DC-10s and other airline-related equipment used by directors in 
commercials, television shows and films. 
</P>
<P>
Airline Film and TV is in a business in about as narrow a niche as they come. 
Few airlines use their planes even for their own commercials, and for other 
entertainment projects filming on an actual plane tends to be clumsy and often 
prohibitively expensive. Grounding a single jumbo jet can cost an airline as 
much as $150,000 a day in lost revenue. So directors usually film inside of 
mock-ups such as the ones owned by Jacobsen and Schmidt. They also use a fake 
ticket counter and boarding gate Jacobsen and Schmidt have in the warehouse, 
and sometimes buy file footage of airliners from them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daily Rate 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen and Schmidt charge a daily rate of $2,500 to $4,000, depending on the 
type of mock-up being used. The cost is less on days when film crews and 
designers are setting up scenes than on days when actual filming occurs. 
</P>
<P>
The airliner mock-ups in their warehouse resemble wooden skeletons of planes 
without wings or tails. The cabin of their mock 747 is about 30% the size of a 
real one. Inside, it resembles a real airliner, with such touches as movie 
screens that can be hung from the front of the cabin, kitchens, restrooms and a 
spiral staircase inside of the first-class section. Various production tricks 
can be used to make "sky" show through the windows. 
</P>
<P>
"To the camera eye, it is absolutely realistic. You can't tell the difference," 
said Bill Alenson, an advertising executive with United Airlines, which 
frequently uses Airline Film and TV's warehouse to film commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes filming resembles real life as well. Jacobsen and Schmidt recalled 
that one extra in a television series two years ago needed an airsick bag after 
he and the other extras were asked to pretend they were being tossed around by 
turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,000 Commercials 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen and Schmidt estimate that since forming their company in 1974, their 
mock-ups have been used in 1,000 commercials, 250 television shows and 100 
feature films. The company has grown to about $700,000 a year in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Recent films that have used their equipment include "Midnight Run" with Robert 
De Niro and Charles Grodin and "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," a comedy 
starring Steve Martin and John Candy. Last month, NBC aired the television 
movie "The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story" starring actress 
Lindsay Wagner in the story of the 1985 TWA hijacking in Greece. A large part 
of the film was shot at a studio using an Airline Film and TV mock-up, which 
was disassembled and hauled by truck to the studio. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Pacoima warehouse also contains equipment used in some memorable 
Hollywood scenes. The fake cockpit used in producer Howard Koch's "Airplane!" 
comedies sits in the warehouse. Jacobsen and Schmidt helped ready the cockpit 
mock-ups for the two films, "Airplane!" in 1980, with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as 
the co-pilot, and "Airplane II: The Sequel," in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In one part of the warehouse is a mock-up of an old Constellation airliner that 
Marilyn Monroe sat in during a scene in "How To Marry a Millionaire." One of 
Fred Astaire's last performances, an airline commercial with Gene Kelly, was 
filmed in one of their mock-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Airline Film and TV Promotions is an outgrowth of a promotion business Trans 
World Airlines once operated in Van Nuys. In the 1950s and 1960s, TWA made 
available mock-ups to directors in exchange for plugs in movies, which explains 
why in so many film characters always flew TWA. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen, 52, a native of Norway, and Schmidt, 64, a native of South Dakota, 
met while working for the TWA operation. 
</P>
<P>
As an actor, Jacobsen said, he had plenty of roles, mostly small ones. He 
appeared in 248 television shows, including "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea," 
the "Batman" television series and "General Electric True," a CBS show launched 
by Jack Webb in 1962 that lasted just 33 episodes. Jacobsen also appeared in 
five feature films. Schmidt was a marketing and promotions executive who went 
to work for TWA in the early 1950s soon after graduating from the USC. 
</P>
<P>
The two men formed their company 15 years ago, initially working under contract 
to TWA and then going off on their own in 1979, the year they moved their 
operation to Pacoima. TWA is no longer involved in the mock-up business, and 
today Jacobsen and Schmidt own many of TWA's old mock-ups. 
</P>
<P>
To keep their equipment up-to-date, the two partners regularly attend auctions 
to bid on damaged or surplus airplane gear. They recently bought a row of 
coach-class airplane seats for $200, compared to about $7,000 for a new row. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason the mock-ups are popular with directors and producers is 
control and cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Easy to Shoot' 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy to shoot there," Koch said. He said that although he has shot 
inside of a real plane before, he finds it easier and less costly to use 
facilities such as the one Jacobsen and Schmidt own. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting at airports is still popular. Phillip Ewbank, superintendent of 
operations at Los Angeles International Airport and once LAX's liaison with the 
film industry, said typically there are about five projects a week filming at 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
But it can be costly and, for some directors, troublesome. The basic costs of 
shooting at the airport can range from $1,000 to $5,000 daily, which includes 
such fees as a permit, paying for security guards and electricians and parking. 
An additional amount is usually paid when a specific airliner's facilities are 
used. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest cost is insurance. To shoot in a plane can require an insurance 
policy for tens of millions of dollars in coverage. At LAX, the amount of 
insurance coverage required by the airport alone ranges from $500,000 for 
shooting outside a terminal away from the airfield to $4 million if they are 
shooting in an area where there are planes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Problems 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is noise and security -- film crews must be watched so they 
don't accidentally violate security. Loud noises can also happen at any time, 
although directors can often record dialogue again and insert it into a film. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen and Schmidt said that as a result, directors and producers often find 
mock-ups the best alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Joe Public probably thinks it is real," Jacobsen said. "I don't think 
people conceive these things as mock-ups, except executives at studios, airline 
executives or directors because they know you can't shoot some of these shots 
on a regular plane."

PROGNOSIS IS PROMISING FOR HOSPITAL GEAR LEASING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul E. Stevenson spent much of his life searching for satisfying work -- and 
coming up short. 
</P>
<P>
He traded stocks, helped produce a few low-grade movies (including "The 
Incredible Two-Headed Transplant" with Bruce Dern) in the 1970s and helped 
develop a drip-irrigation system for home use. Once, when his money ran out, 
Stevenson drove a cab in Los Angeles for a year. He also spent several years as 
a lawyer, but gave it up. 
</P>
<P>
"I never liked the practice of law," he said. "I have an adventurous spirit." 
</P>
<P>
By 1981, he was running a now-defunct company, Paramedical, that distributed 
hospital equipment. Stevenson and three other Paramedical officers decided to 
form their own company, ATI Medical in Glendale, to rent medical equipment to 
hospitals. Each one chipped in $1,000 to get it started. 
</P>
<P>
Their timing was prescient. Government health agencies were just beginning 
their now-widespread cutbacks on reimbursements to hospitals for patients' 
care. So hospitals' budgets for buying new equipment were cut, prompting them 
to increasingly rent gear as needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Surged 
</P>
<P>
The result: ATI's business has surged. Its annual revenue has jumped an average 
72% over the past four years; in its fiscal year that ended July 31, its 
revenue totaled $25.8 million, and in the first nine months of fiscal 1989, 
ATI's revenue already had reached $29 million, up another 56% from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
More important, ATI lately has bolstered what had been its relatively low 
profit and profit margin. In fiscal 1988, ATI earned $571,146, a mere 2 cents 
per dollar of sales. But in the first nine months of fiscal 1989, ATI's profit 
totaled $1.51 million, or 5 cents per sales dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the products that ATI rents sell for less than $10,000. They include 
incubators for babies, blood pressure monitors, exercise equipment and 
intravenous products. But ATI avoids such big-ticket items as X-ray and CAT 
scan machines because if ATI could not consistently rent them, "you're going to 
be paying through the nose and I don't want to take that kind of risk," 
Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
ATI has 48 branch offices nationwide, 440 employees and 3,600 customers. And 
Stevenson's days of hauling taxi fares are long behind him. Now 61, his 10% 
ownership of ATI's stock has a current market value of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevenson, as ATI's chairman, president and chief executive, still has to 
watch his step. To accommodate the hospitals' feverish demand for rented 
equipment, ATI has borrowed heavily to buy the rental equipment. "You can't 
rent what you don't own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$25-Million Debt 
</P>
<P>
As of April 30, ATI's long-term debt totaled $25 million, nearly four times 
bigger than its net worth -- that is, its assets minus its debts -- and up from 
less than $1 million only three years ago. A sharp rise in interest rates, or a 
sudden slowdown in business, might make it difficult for ATI to pay its debts. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson is unruffled. He noted that rental/leasing companies typically have 
debts that far exceed their net worth because they must repeatedly build their 
inventory of equipment to rent. (Indeed, two truck-leasing companies, RLC Corp. 
and Ryder System, also have high debt-to-equity ratios.) He also said ATI's 
interest cost on its debt is a manageable 18%-22% of its total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as risky as it would appear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't always been easy, either. A year ago, Chase Manhattan Bank made a 
commitment to lend $25 million to ATI, but had not yet actually turned the 
money over to the company. Nonetheless, ATI bought several million dollars 
worth of equipment. But at that last moment, Chase decided not to lend the 
money, leaving ATI's finances "very strained" and forcing the company to 
scramble for a loan elsewhere, according to ATI's 1988 annual report. 
</P>
<P>
Was ATI guilty of spending what it did not have? "Sure," Stevenson said. "But 
we couldn't have built the company from zero to $40 or $50 million without 
being a little anticipatory in terms of getting equipment." In other words, 
without hoping for a good roll of the dice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Richer I Get' 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Stevenson wants ATI to keep growing a robust 50%-60% a year. Why? "When 
you have a growing company, everybody working there is a lot happier," he said. 
"Secondly, the faster it grows, obviously the richer I get, and I like that 
idea completely." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, a burly, no-nonsense type, lives in Las Vegas because he tired of 
Southern California's crowded freeways and because Nevada has no state personal 
income tax. 
</P>
<P>
He kept ATI in Glendale, however, because "Wall Street doesn't like companies 
located in Nevada because it thinks if you're in Nevada, you're going to be a 
Mafia company or you're a gambler, which 
</P>
<P>
is absurd," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He commutes to Glendale about once a week, but prefers staying out of his 
workers' way. "My theory of managing a company is that I like to see every 
decision made at the lowest possible competent level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevenson also has some strict work rules for his employees. "I tell people 
when they come to work for me that they can get fired for three things: If they 
kiss my ass, if they write a memo or if they rent to an individual," he said. 
Individuals tend to sue over problems with their equipment more than hospitals, 
he said, and memos are a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rented to Studios 
</P>
<P>
After Stevenson and the others started ATI, they persuaded investor Michael 
Kaufman to put up $200,000 to get the company going. Kaufman, who owns 12% of 
the company, remains a director, and two of the other three original investors, 
Stephen W. Case and Lester W. Grove, are ATI vice presidents who own about 10% 
and 11%, respectively, of its stock, according to ATI's latest proxy statement. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, ATI rented half of its equipment to Hollywood studios, which used 
them as props in such shows as "St. Elsewhere" and "Dynasty." But entertainment 
rentals now account for only 2% of ATI's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
ATI sold its first stock to the public for $2 a share in 1986. The stock traded 
at nearly $14 before tumbling in the 1987 market crash, but this year it's been 
climbing again and closed Monday at $10.75 a share on the American Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the stock and the company growing, Stevenson has other hurdles to 
overcome. ATI competes against three other major rivals in the hospital 
equipment-rental market: Medirec in Salt Lake City and Universal Hospital 
Services in Bloomington, Minn., which are both privately owned, and PRN, a unit 
of publicly held Mediq in Pennsauken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
For years, each of those companies operated fairly close to home, thereby 
dividing the equipment rental market into regions that each dominated. But ATI 
helped change that by opening a series of branches across the country, 
prompting its competitors to expand as well and so creating national 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Until ATI stepped into the block, there was really no head-to-head competition 
between any of the major players," said Dennis Tolman, Medirec's vice president 
of national accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Yet ATI's rapid growth means that the company has had to fill its offices with 
lots of new employees, which jeopardizes Stevenson's ability to maintain 
consistent service nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have good people in every single office," Stevenson conceded. "We're 
not magicians. When people turn out to be not what we thought they were, we get 
rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
All four of the major rental companies have benefited from the industrywide 
surge in hospitals' demand for rented products. Tolman estimates that 
industrywide rental revenue amounts to nearly $300 million a year and is 
growing by 50% or more a year. 
</P>
<P>
But there's disagreement over whether ATI's growth means that the company has 
been snaring market share away from the other three players. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Wenell, vice president of marketing for Universal Hospital Services, 
said: "The fact that we've continued to expand ourselves and have not been hurt 
or displaced by them shows their growth is in addition to ours, not at the 
expense of ours." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Been Painful' 
</P>
<P>
But Tolman conceded that ATI has taken market share from Medirec and the 
others, and said, "It's absurd that they could be new and only pick up 
brand-new clients." But with everyone enjoying growth, "it has not been painful 
for any of the other three competitors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, ATI's growth occasionally prompts people to sound out Stevenson on 
whether ATI is for sale. Is Stevenson interested? 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them I have two ambitions," he said. "Either I'd like to be nice and 
rich" if the right buyout offer came along, or "I would like to build a Fortune 
500 company out of $1,000" if no offer is forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to them," he added. "I also tell them they're not going to buy it 
cheap."

Comedian Dom DeLuise has left the Music Center Opera cast of "Orpheus in the 
Underworld" to go to New York where his mother is critically ill. He was 
replaced in the performances Saturday and Sunday by Roderick Cook, who received 
a 1987 Tony nomination for his acting in "Oh Coward!" Cook will continue to 
cover the role of Public Opinion, pending DeLuise's return to the production, 
which closes July 2. ALEENE MacMINN

Actor William Hurt and the attorney for his former lover screamed at each other 
during cross-examination Monday on the opening day of a palimony trial in 
Manhattan Superior Court. Hurt took the stand without looking at ballerina 
Sandra Jennings, the mother of his 6-year-old son, Alexander. Jennings, 32, 
claims she and Hurt, 39, lived together as common-law husband and wife for 
about two years, mostly in New York, and she seeks half of his $10 million in 
earnings. As attorney Richard Golub asked about the relationship, Hurt said he 
told Jennings he wasn't going to be married again because "I had gotten 
burned." "What do you mean by burned?" Golub pressed. "Scorched," Hurt said as 
the courtroom erupted in laughter. "Scorched?" Golub asked. "Wounded. Hurt," 
Hurt said. "Body heat!" Golub screamed, invoking the title of one of Hurt's 
movies. Hurt's faced flushed with anger. "Get off it!" the actor shouted. Golub 
told the court he intends to prove that Jennings has a common-law marriage to 
Hurt. The actor's attorney, Martin Shelton, says the claim is concocted without 
the slightest basis in fact. ALEENE MacMINN

The Casino Royale, the last theater in downtown Washington showing X-rated 
pornographic movies, has become the victim of urban development. Workmen moved 
in over the weekend to prepare to demolish the theater that is located two 
blocks from the White House. The marquee still listed the last double feature, 
"Bring on the Virgins" and "Passionfest." The theater and an adjoining adult 
bookstore are giving way to an office building. The Casino Royale was in the 
heart of the block which until recently also had a massage parlor and clubs 
featuring nude dancers and X-rated videos. Two other theaters in the Washington 
area still show full length adult films. One is in a northeast neighborhood and 
the other is in a shopping mall in the city's Virginia suburbs. ALEENE MacMINN

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FIRST-TIME DIRECTORS MAKE IMPRESSIVE DEBUTS AT EUROFEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

New films by such masters as Ermanno Olmi and Jacques Rivette plus impressive 
directorial debuts from Max Von Sydow and composer Michel Legrand highlight the 
sixth American Film Institute's European Community Festival, which runs Friday 
through June 29 at the Fine Arts in Beverly Hills. As before, the overall 
quality level is higher than that of the AFI's FilmFest, and at a time when 
markedly fewer foreign films are released, the EuroFest may be your one chance 
to see even the best of these offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the festival at 6:45 p.m. is Olmi's "The Legend of the Holy Drinker," a 
droll, gentle fable of beguiling beauty and religious mysticism starring Rutger 
Hauer. He plays an alcoholic vagrant with a tragic secret who receives an 
unexpected blessing, yet each time he attempts to repay it he encounters 
unexpected obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
If there's no good reason beyond the obvious commercial one for this film to be 
in English -- the setting is Paris, and Hauer plays a one-time coal miner from 
Silesia -- at least the dialogue is easy and colloquial. Hauer has a low-key 
power, Paris never looked so enticingly sleazy and romantic and "The Legend of 
the Holy Drinker," adapted from the Joseph Roth novel, is a winner -- a literal 
one having won the Italian Oscar equivalent of Best Film, Direction and 
Cinematography. (It screens again on Saturday at 12 noon). 
</P>
<P>
Rivette's "The Gang of Four" (Saturday at 3, Sunday at 2) is his usual fiercely 
demanding interplay of art and life as a group of young acting students become 
caught up in the mystery and danger engulfing a former colleague and housemate. 
"The Gang of Four" on the one hand recalls Rivette's "Paris nous appartient" in 
its evocation of paranoia and "L'Amour fou" on the other, with the students 
finding themselves playing roles in life as well as on the stage. As long (160 
minutes) and grueling as it is, "The Gang of Four" is worth the effort, and 
Rivette's young actresses lighten the journey with their loveliness, talent and 
individuality. The caring, detailed delineation of these young people coping 
with everyday life while ardently pursuing their dreams evokes both humor and 
compassion. Cast as the girls' exacting teacher is the exquisite Bulle Ogier, 
one of Rivette's favorite actresses. 
</P>
<P>
With the pure enchantment of "Katinka" (Saturday at 7), Max Von Sydow proves to 
be as skilled a director as he is an actor. This irresistible period piece, 
adapted from a novel by Herman Bang and set in rural turn-of-the-century 
Norway, is a beautifully told story of the love that develops between a young 
stationmaster's wife (Tammi Ost) and the handsome new manager of the largest 
estate in the area (Kurt Ravn). The past comes vividly alive in Von Sydow's 
loving observation of both daily life and hearty holiday celebrations. There's 
something of Renoir and, not surprisingly, much of Ingmar Bergman in this film, 
and for all the emotions Ost and Ravn stir in us over their predicament, they 
above all earn our respect for their old-fashioned sense of honor and 
responsibility, especially in regard to Ost's good-natured husband (Ole 
Ernest). 
</P>
<P>
Spanish film maker Antonio del Real's leisurely "The River That Was" (Sunday at 
6 p.m.) follows a group of loggers, headed by Alfredo Landa (star of "The Holy 
Innocents") as they guide thousands of logs down the River Tajo from Paralejos 
de las Truchas to Aranjuez. The time is 1946, and this will be the last such 
journey before trucks are to start transporting the logs. A war-weary Irishman 
of partial Spanish descent (a reflective Tony Peck) joins the loggers, whom he 
discovers to be a hearty, honorable band of free spirits at odds with a 
corrupt, fascist society. At times the film, for all its pastoral beauty, feels 
overly long and tedious, yet there's no denying that its slow pace matches the 
tempo of a way of life it depicts with such concern. 
</P>
<P>
Also screening is "The Tall Guy" (Friday at 9:10), which stars Jeff Goldblum as 
an American actor in London and which was unavailable for preview, and two 
disappointments, "Paperback Woman" (Saturday at 9, Sunday at noon) and "The 
Woman Who Dreamed" (Sunday at 8:30). More about EuroFest films, including the 
Michel Legrand film, in next week's Special Screenings. For further 
information: (213) 856-7707, 652-1330.

KID BEAT: 'DEAR GABBY': PAIN OF GROWING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Take a teen to see "Dear Gabby" at the Santa Monica Playhouse and don't be 
surprised if memories of your own bewildering adolescence come winging back to 
you. 
</P>
<P>
This unusual theater piece, subtitled "The Confessions of an Overachiever," 
movingly articulates the loneliness and confusion of growing up "without an 
instruction booklet." 
</P>
<P>
Alex (Alex Cohen) is a bright 16-year-old who glibly writes the "Dear Gabby" 
advice column for her school newspaper. Writer's block sets in when Alex begins 
seeing the letters as more than "a challenge for my semantic prowess" and 
realizes they represent real people in pain. Pain that she shares, but tries to 
hide. 
</P>
<P>
Shana (Shana Feste), writes that she can't fit in and has no friends; Liz (Liz 
Dean) loves Obi (Obi Ndefo) but feels trapped tied to one boy. She can't bring 
herself to hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
Loren (Loren Fierstein) is anxious about her sister's (Heather Ross) drug use 
and dependence on drug-using friends, while Aisha (Aisha Wagle) is bothered by 
her friends' classroom cheating. 
</P>
<P>
Written and directed by Chris De Carlo and Evelyn Rudie, the language of the 
play is both playful and literate, exploring ethics and societal contradictions 
with multisyllabic alliteration and plentiful quotations, from Shakespeare to 
Marshall McLuhan. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there is a danger of pretentiousness and condescension, but neither is the 
case here. While not a medium for hard-core concerns, such as gangs, suicide or 
pregnancy, there is surprising realism in the play's soft approach that tells 
teens they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
The gutsy ending is a direct appeal to audience members for a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
There is little of the self-consciousness that usually tags non-adult 
productions. The staging, designed for a tiny space, is fluid, and the red, 
black and white makeup and costumes are striking. 
</P>
<P>
The nine outstanding young actors, ages 12 to 18, students of the Playhouse's 
Young Professionals theater training program, are from the original 1988 
"Gabby" cast that recently toured Canada. Three casts now take the show into 
schools and are planning more international tours. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1211 4th St., Santa Monica, Thursday through Sunday only, 7:30p.m. $12-$15. 
(213) 394-9779.

AN APPEALING 'FUNNY THING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Something appealing, something appalling." 
</P>
<P>
That's what we're promised in the opening number of "A Funny Thing Happened on 
the Way to the Forum." Fortunately, California Music Theatre's "Forum," at 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium, offers more that's appealing than appalling. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a foregone conclusion, considering some of this group's recent 
productions, such as its recent "Kiss Me Kate." One big improvement is the 
audibility of the words. Nearly every phrase in Stephen Sondheim's score and 
the Burt Shevelove-Larry Gelbart book can be understood. 
</P>
<P>
The performances deserve to be understood too. The production is held together 
exceptionally well by E. E. Bell's Pseudolus, the wily Roman slave who hopes to 
win his freedom by uniting his young master Hero (Richard Waterhouse) with the 
dim-but-winsome object of his affections (Heather Lee). 
</P>
<P>
Bell looks so much like Zero Mostel, the original Pseudolus, that separate 
pictures of the two actors in the souvenir program look as if they could be 
depicting the same man. But Bell's Pseudolus has his own distinctive sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
With his ample double chin and twinkling eyes, Bell looks downright jolly. His 
conniving has a soft edge; when he sings of how he wants to be free, it's 
genuinely moving. Even his leering seems rather innocent. He zooms about the 
stage with precision and sings with power. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Tucci's Hysterium, the house servant who becomes a reluctant 
co-conspirator with Pseudolus, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, exactly 
where he should be. 
</P>
<P>
Barney Martin's hangdog face is perfect for the role of Senex, the hen-pecked 
master of Pseudolus' household. Waterhouse and Lee are amusingly blithe as the 
young lovers; Lee in particular has adroit comic timing. "For us, there will 
never be happiness," she says with a sigh. "We will have to learn to be happy 
without it." Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Ritschel looks properly crass as the procurer. Harvey Vernon plays the 
aged neighbor with the same sense of vaudeville style that prevails throughout 
the production. Kelly Britt is a sharp-tongued harpie. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Netherton doesn't make the full-scale impression, vocally or physically, 
that Captain Miles Gloriosus ought to make. There were a couple of errant 
moments in Ward Carlisle's lighting design. The opening number wasn't quite as 
funny as you would expect "Comedy Tonight" to be; wasn't Jeff Rizzo's musical 
direction a little too slow at the top of the show? 
</P>
<P>
Generally, though, director Gary Davis and Rizzo deliver a smartly paced and 
sung "Forum." Best of all, for those who remember the most recent "Forum" at 
the Pantages, there is nothing resembling Mickey Rooney's stage-hogging. Now 
there was something that was more appalling than appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 At 300 E. Green St., Pasadena, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Saturday 
and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m., through July 2. Tickets: $15-$30; (213) 
410-1062.

POLLUTION: SMALL-TOWN PROFILE IN LARGE PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Who's Killing Calvert City?," a "Frontline" documentary airing tonight at 9 
on Channels 28 and 15 and at 10 on Channel 50, we get a close look at the 
citizens of a small, one-industry Kentucky town reaping a bitter legacy from 
the hometown product. 
</P>
<P>
The local industry: chemical manufacturing. The legacy: pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Although producer Michael Mierendorf somewhat stacks the deck in favor of 
environmentalists, this is not a one-sided issue: There are many residents who 
feel the pollution controversy has been blown out of proportion, that it is not 
nearly as serious as environmental activists believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Calvert City" also shows that this is not simply an environmental issue. The 
chemical plants have brought prosperity to the rural area; many residents fear 
that a "pollution panic" could ruin the town's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
One of the constants that run through "Calvert City" is that nobody has got a 
clear idea of exactly what is going on. "We don't know what's being discharged 
from the plants. We don't know what's being discharged into the air or seeping 
into the ground," says Don Harker, head of the state Environmental Protection 
Agency's waste division, a man who presumably should know. 
</P>
<P>
This lack of information ultimately becomes "Calvert City's" strong suit, a 
subtle point in an otherwise not-subtle show. 
</P>
<P>
If the experts can't measure the impact of this toxic waste, then maybe it's 
time for everyone -- chemical manufacturers, government agencies, citizens -- 
to get some clear answers before proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
The woes of this small town do not exist in a vacuum. In an era when toxic 
pollution is a world-wide problem, "Who's Killing Calvert City?" is a 
small-town profile with much larger implications.

U.S. EMPLOYEES TAKING IT SLOW IN RETURNING TO CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA and GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Spear, his wife Liang and their two children took off from Ontario 
International Airport at 9 a.m. Monday, bound for Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Spear was returning to his job as manager of an international subsidiary of 
Unison Group, a San Bruno, Calif., company that advises foreign firms about 
doing business in China. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt the Japanese hadn't pulled out many of their businessmen," said his 
father, James Spear Sr. "He felt for the long term he should be there." The 
decision has his parents, who live in Covina, worried. 
</P>
<P>
Spear is one of a few American businessmen trickling back into Beijing. Two 
weeks ago, U.S. executives and their families abruptly packed up and fled China 
when the government massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators began in Tian An 
Men Square on June 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coordinated Effort 
</P>
<P>
Occidental Petroleum's staff of five is back in Beijing. Dependents of the 
company's 75 U.S. mine workers in China, who also were evacuated, "are now 
being told that they can or may go back at their convenience," said a spokesman 
for the Los Angeles firm. Pitman Potter, a Graham &amp; Jones attorney, headed 
back to Beijing on Monday, but his wife and child stayed behind in the States. 
</P>
<P>
The return of some U.S. personnel is occurring amid a coordinated effort by the 
Chinese government to lure foreign businesses back with assurances that things 
are back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
"A few companies are either contemplating going back or possibly sending one 
person back as a scout," said Richard Brecher, investment manager at U.S.-China 
Business Council in Washington. "Just about everyone has been contacted by the 
Chinese, primarily by their Chinese partners. They are all echoing the similar 
'all is well, business is normal, what are you waiting for? Just come on back.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Despite such assurances, most other U.S. companies are proceeding cautiously, 
mindful of the State Department advisory against travel to China and the 
warning from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that the Chinese government may use 
returning businessmen as fodder for propaganda purposes to show that business 
has not been disrupted. State-run television has featured interviews with 
Japanese and European businessmen who either stayed or have recently returned. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe business is normal or could be normal," Brecher said. "We are 
suggesting people train a critical eye on these statements coming out of China. 
It takes more than good words to make a good healthy investment environment in 
China; it always has, now more so." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow and Cautious 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. companies are taking such a cautious attitude. Chrysler, for example, 
has tentative plans to send its Beijing Jeep staff back no earlier than July. 
The eight American employees and their families are scattered in Hong Kong, 
Australia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We're businessmen, not politicians, and (we) don't appreciate being used for 
propaganda or anything else," said Richard H. Ott, vice president for 
Chrysler's Beijing Jeep joint venture. "We have a business in China, it has 
done quite well, we have many friends in the business community." 
</P>
<P>
Ott said in a telephone interview from his home in Michigan: "Nothing is firmed 
up yet. We've been invited by phone, by letter and by fax. We're taking a slow 
and deliberate entry. We're observing how things go first, to assure safety 
first." 
</P>
<P>
The communications from Chrysler's Chinese partners, according to Ott, say "the 
counterrevolutionaries have been put down and business is normal in Beijing. 
How soon can you come back?" 
</P>
<P>
He and another Chrysler official plan to return to Beijing first, before 
calling the rest of the staff back. "Our own desire is to make sure things are 
safe to go back. We also have a man stationed in Hong Kong right now, meeting 
with others companies in the same status we are." 
</P>
<P>
The government crackdown disrupted production at the Chrysler plant for one 
week. Ott said it is difficult to translate that loss into dollars, but that 
the Chinese government is pushing to make up the lost production. 
</P>
<P>
Arco's staff of five Americans is still in Hong Kong after evacuating Beijing. 
"We have no plans to send them in yet," a spokesman said. "As far as we know, 
they have no communications with our people in China asking us to come back at 
this time. We just want to see what develops. We don't want to expose people to 
any danger. We're just being cautious." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picking Up the Pieces 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto said it has no immediate plans to return the 
20 employees that it removed from Beijing and Shanghai. "They have not returned 
and right now we have no plans for them returning," said Joan Tharp, a 
spokesman for the computer and electronics giant. 
</P>
<P>
Spear's father did not like seeing his son return to Beijing so soon. "We would 
have liked to see them spend more time here until at least the State Department 
had made further comments and other American businesses were returning," said 
Spear's father. 
</P>
<P>
Spear, 33, was worried that foreign companies would try to take away Unison's 
business. "He was concerned that if they didn't get back there would be other 
countries there to pick up the pieces," his father said. "He felt strongly that 
the best thing American business could do at this point is to get back to China 
and try and recover." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach sent Gareth Chang, vice president 
for Asia/Pacific operations, to Hong Kong last weekend to help the aerospace 
company decide when it is safe for its 50 China-based employees to return to 
the mainland from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of when we will go back is one that is being addressed on a daily 
basis," said Don Hanson, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
He said employees now waylaid in Hong Kong are eager to return to China. "That 
question was asked of all employees assembled in Hong Kong, and I'm told the 
answer was unanimous: They want to go back." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas is building twin-engine MD-80 jets in a joint venture with 
Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments in Fullerton said it anticipates sending its employees back 
to Beijing shortly. The medical equipment company ordered at least three 
employees to get out of China and go to Hong Kong or Singapore. 
</P>

ESCROW FIRM'S CLIENTS TO GET PARTIAL REFUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
10% OF FUNDS TO BE HELD FOR 'POSSIBLE SHORTAGES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Three months after state officials seized an Encino escrow firm, the Escrow 
Shoppe, and froze $5.5 million of customers' money, the customers are finally 
getting their money back -- but not all of it. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Russell A. Greenwood, a court-appointed receiver examining the 
Escrow Shoppe's books, unfroze most of the money but withheld 10% of each 
customer's amount. Why? Judy Hartley, a senior lawyer with the state Department 
of Corporations, which licenses escrow firms, said up to $450,000 of the money 
might still be missing. 
</P>
<P>
The Escrow Shoppe had about 350 pending transactions when it was seized. 
</P>
<P>
One customer, David Fein, said he was glad that he was finally getting his 
cash, but "annoyed" that 10% of his money is being withheld because of 
continuing confusion over the Escrow Shoppe mess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Should Be Cleared Up' 
</P>
<P>
"I would think by now it should be cleared up whether there are missing funds 
or not," said Fein, who had sold his house in Woodland Hills just as the Escrow 
Shoppe was seized and whose five-figure profit on the sale was frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Firms such as the Escrow Shoppe help ensure that buyers and sellers of real 
estate meet certain conditions, such as obtaining a title search, and hold 
documents and cash transferred between the parties until the sale is completed. 
</P>
<P>
When the Department of Corporations seized the Escrow Shoppe in mid-March, it 
alleged that the firm had made $3 million in unauthorized payments and that 
about $200,000 of customers' funds might be missing. The agency alleged, among 
other things, that the firm had shifted money from some pending escrow accounts 
to pay customers closing other escrow accounts -- all without customer 
authorization. The state also froze the customers' money to get an accurate 
accounting of the Escrow Shoppe's assets. 
</P>
<P>
But as the state investigated, customers grew furious. With their money frozen, 
they could not complete their transactions unless they put up more money. Their 
financial and housing plans were thrown into chaos, and authorities could not 
predict when the money would become available. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley said 10% of customers' money is still being withheld "to cover possible 
shortages" but said she had no additional details. Susan Allison, a lawyer for 
Greenwood's office, would say only that "we have to pursue what are some 
unexplained transactions." 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Bianco is the owner of the Escrow Shoppe and one of her attorneys, 
Thomas Warden, said he was aware of the state's concern about the possible 
shortages but that he had no details. He also noted that there is no criminal 
action pending against Bianco, nor is she facing any formal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The indications of further shortages appear to be at least partly related to a 
civil suit filed May 1 in Los Angeles Superior Court by Los Angeles Martinique 
Investments, a real-estate partnership, against the Escrow Shoppe, Bianco and 
another firm owned by Bianco named Encino Equity Services. 
</P>
<P>
Encino Equity is a so-called accommodator firm used in commercial real estate 
deals. Specifically, when a group wants to sell one property at a profit and 
reinvest that profit in another property without paying taxes on the profit in 
the meantime, it must use an accommodator to hold the profit as a third party 
until the money is reinvested. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Los Angeles Martinique pursued such a deal. According to its 
suit, the partnership sold a Hollywood apartment complex in February for a 
$451,000 profit, using the Escrow Shoppe as its escrow firm. Then it turned 
over the profit to Encino Equity -- which had been recommended by the Escrow 
Shoppe as its accommodator -- as it searched for a new property in which to 
invest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escrow Shoppe Seized 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, it found a new apartment building to buy and asked Encino Equity 
to deposit the partnership's $451,000 for its purchase of the new property. But 
Encino Equity never turned over the money, the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, the Department of Corporations seized the Escrow Shoppe. The 
partnership's lawsuit accuses the defendants of fraud, breach of contract and 
negligence, among other things, and asserts that the Escrow Shoppe and Encino 
Equity were insolvent and that the defendants' "secret intent" was not to 
complete the transaction, "but rather to close both businesses and to retain 
the sale proceeds for their own use." The two firms and Bianco denied the 
suit's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Martinique is not among the Escrow Shoppe customers getting 90% of 
their money back. Los Angeles Martinique's attorney Howard Grady explained that 
technically it was out of escrow, it had closed the sale of the first apartment 
building and its money was not part of the $5.5 million in the Escrow Shoppe's 
trust fund that was frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the major players in the Escrow Shoppe mess are spreading the blame 
for why the customers' money had to remain frozen for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley of the Department of Corporations said her agency had to go to court to 
get the necessary records because of delays by the Escrow Shoppe, Encino Equity 
and their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
But Warden said his people did cooperate, that the state's court action was 
unnecessary and that the delay was caused by Greenwood, who was "very slow in 
doing his accounting."

Weyerhaeuser Selling Unit: Tacoma, Wash.-based Weyerhaeuser Co. is selling its 
profitable gypsum wallboard business. The move is another in a series of sales 
by Weyerhaeuser to divest itself of businesses that "fall outside the company's 
desired strategic focus." The timber company announced at its April 20 
shareholders meeting that many operations would be sold. The gypsum mine and 
wallboard facility in Briar, Ark., is the third-largest such facility in the 
United States, with annual production capacity in excess of 600 million square 
feet and annual sales of more than $35 million. The plant employs 223 workers.

Mosbacher Defends Get-Tough Approach: Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher 
defended the Administration's get-tough approach to opening foreign markets to 
American products, saying the effort must be made to correct huge trade 
imbalances. In an address at the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute, 
Mosbacher called last year's U.S. trade deficit of $120 billion unacceptable 
and said more has to be done to reduce the imbalance. Mosbacher defended the 
Administration's decision last month to target Japan, Brazil and India for 
erecting barriers to sales of American goods.

Trump's Bid for Casino Temporarily Stopped: After a brief hearing, U.S. 
District Court Judge Rosemary Gambardella issued a temporary restraining order 
blocking Donald J. Trump's $63-million bid to buy the debt-ridden Elsinore's 
Atlantis Casino Hotel. Creditors who hold mortgages on three of the Atlantic 
City casino's parking lots asked for the order. The creditors said they weren't 
given adequate notice of details surrounding the proposed offer. Judge 
Gambardella scheduled another hearing for June 29.

2 COMPETITORS JOIN FORCES IN BID TO PIPE GAS TO CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owners of two proposed pipelines to bring natural gas from Wyoming and Texas 
into Southern California proposed Monday to join forces, a key strategic move 
in the ongoing competition to peddle natural gas to Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the Kern River and Mojave pipelines -- until now competing bitterly 
against each other for federal permission to build interstate lines into 
California -- said they agreed to merge their pipelines at Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
The jointly owned portion of pipe carrying up to 1.1 billion cubic feet of 
natural gas per day would then proceed toward the Bakersfield area, where some 
would be used in the oil fields and the rest would be diverted for other 
commercial or residential use. 
</P>
<P>
A third party to the Kern-Mojave deal is Southern California Gas Co., which 
agreed to buy Wyoming natural gas from the interstate pipeline to serve its 
customers. The gas company would be able to buy the California section of pipe 
in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance is a major step in a long-running process of determining which of 
half a dozen pipeline projects will ultimately win federal permission, 
customers and financing deemed necessary to begin construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compete With PG&amp;E 
</P>
<P>
By joining forces, the Mojave and Kern projects appeared to create a major 
competitor for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. of San Francisco. The utility's 
pipeline subsidiary, PGT, has signed up enough customers to fill a proposed 600 
million cubic feet per day pipeline that would run directly from Canada into 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"There are now clearly two front-runners," said Michael Day, deputy general 
counsel of the California Public Utilities Commission, which earlier this year 
instructed the various developers to work out deals among themselves. "This is 
the start of the end game." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC will recommend a favored pipeline or combination of lines, but the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the final regulatory voice. 
</P>
<P>
A PGT spokeswoman dismissed the Kern-Mojave venture as little more than the two 
developers' original plans "in a new hat." She said SoCal Gas -- which has 
refused to buy space on PGT's proposed pipeline -- would pay a higher price for 
gas brought in by the pipeline announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big New Market in Kern 
</P>
<P>
However, the PUC's Day noted that the Kern-Mojave project could bring in gas 
directly from three regions -- Wyoming, the U.S. Southwest and Canada -- a key 
advantage in the view of state officials seeking to geographically diversify 
California's energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
The rush to build gas pipelines stems from the big new market for natural gas 
in Kern County's oil fields and, more recently, from spot shortages in Southern 
California, and new environmental pressures to replace oil with natural gas in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
The oil firms need natural gas to generate steam that they pipe underground to 
help bring Kern's tar-like crude oil to the surface. But they want to contract 
for their gas directly through interstate pipelines -- such as the Kern and 
Mojave proposals -- that aren't subject to what the oil firms view as the 
erratic regulatory behavior of the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
The Kern and Mojave pipelines together have apparently signed up most of the 
oil companies and have enlisted SoCal Gas as well, enough to put the Kern 
project above its feasibility "threshold" of 500,000 million cubic feet of gas 
per day, said an aide to Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Wyoming has agreed to subsidize the building of any pipeline to 
California that carries at least 350,000 million cubic feet of Wyoming natural 
gas per day. Sullivan has been lobbying Californians on the virtues of gas from 
his state. 
</P>
<P>
One drawback to the Kern-Mojave project could be its size. Some question 
whether the state will need an extra 1.1 billion cubic feet of gas per day, and 
the cost of unused capacity would ultimately be borne by ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the PGT and Kern-Mojave proposals appear to have the upper hand in 
terms of customers, a third venture -- the Wyoming-California Pipeline Co. -- 
is the only one to date with a pipeline permit from the federal commission. But 
it has only managed to win commitments to buy 100,000 million cubic feet per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen anything that would change our plans," said a spokesman at 
Coastal Corp. in Houston, owner of the Wy-Cal project. He promised an 
announcement soon detailing "one or more" additional customers. 
</P>
<P>
Mojave's proposed pipeline would originate in Topock, Ariz., near the 
California border, and would have an initial capacity of 400 million cubic feet 
per day. The line would be able to bring in additional supplies from the 
Southwest, the major source of California's present gas supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Mojave is owned jointly by Enron Corp., Houston, and El Paso Natural Gas Co., a 
subsidiary of Burlington Resources. 
</P>
<P>
The Kern River pipeline would begin in Opal, Wyo., with an initial capacity of 
700 million cubic feet per day. It is a joint venture of units of Tenneco of 
Houston and the Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla.

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Steven Morris has resigned as publisher of the Daily News after nearly 
two years in the job. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, 37, declined to comment on his resignation. Lynne Jewell, public 
relations manager for the newspaper, also declined to answer questions on why 
Morris resigned, except to say that he plans "to pursue other business 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
Morris' resignation comes amid a period of labor strife at the Woodland 
Hills-based newspaper. In April, reporters, photographers and copy editors 
voted overwhelmingly to elect the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild as their union 
representatives after a three-year organizing drive. Contract negotiations 
opened last Wednesday, a Guild spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris was named publisher in August, 1987, by the newspaper's owner, Jack Kent 
Cooke, a sports and cable television multimillionaire who bought the newspaper 
for $176 million in 1985. Morris, previously vice president of advertising at 
the Denver Post, succeeded Byron C. Campbell, now publisher of the Record in 
Hackensack, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke, who once owned the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings, could not 
be reached for comment. Jewell said the announcement was made by James Lacher, 
executive vice president of Jack Kent Cooke Inc. Lacher is a top executive in 
Cooke's organization. 
</P>

In the six months ending March 31, the Daily News had circulation of 183,402

fiscal first-quarter profit plunged 98% from a year earlier on a 7% decline in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter ended April 30, United Education's net income dropped to $24,000 
from $1.1 million, while its revenue fell to $20.6 million from $22.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
United Education blamed the declines on relatively low unemployment rates, 
which reduced enrollment at its training schools, and higher interest costs.

DRUG TESTS FOR RAIL, AIRLINE WORKERS OKD; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH COURT SAYS FIRMS DON'T NEED UNIONS' PERMISSION FOR EXAMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled Monday that railroads and airlines may administer drug 
tests to employees without first negotiating the issue with their labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-2 decision is the court's first ruling on drug screening in the private 
sector and could affect hundreds of thousands of workers in the two industries. 
</P>
<P>
Although Monday's ruling was based only on interpretation of the federal 
Railway Labor Act, and is not likely to affect other workers in the private 
sector, it clearly shows that the court majority views mandatory drug testing 
as a relatively minor imposition on employees. 
</P>
<P>
The high court said that adding a drug test to a routine urinalysis does not 
represent a major change in the union's contract and therefore does not demand 
collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
The decision allows rail companies to proceed with regular testing of about 
275,000 train workers, and it will prevent unions from blocking the proposed 
testing of 500,000 employees of the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Transportation Department ordered the airline companies to 
prepare an extensive drug-testing program for pilots, flight attendants, 
security personnel and ground crews. By Aug. 18, the companies must submit 
their plans to the Federal Aviation Administration, and testing is to begin by 
the end of the year, an FAA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the Supreme Court upheld government-imposed drug testing for workers 
whose jobs require them to operate dangerous equipment, carry firearms or 
combat illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Union attorneys argued that such testing violates the Fourth Amendment's ban on 
unreasonable searches by government agents. 
</P>
<P>
In a companion ruling handed down the same day, the justices specifically 
upheld a government requirement that train crews be tested for alcohol and 
drugs after an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board reached an opposite conclusion in 
a decision announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The board, in an interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act, said that 
a company may impose drug tests on job applicants, but not on existing workers 
without bargaining with the union. 
</P>
<P>
Although the NLRB covers most union workers, employers remain free to challenge 
this conclusion in the federal courts and eventually in the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The high court ruling Monday involved Conrail, the Consolidated Rail Corp., 
which cited a series of train accidents that were blamed on crew members' 
impairment by drugs or alcohol when it announced in February, 1987, that it was 
adding a mandatory drug test to the employees' annual physical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
The existing contract between Conrail and its unions allowed for physical 
exams, but union lawyers said that the inclusion of drug testing was a major 
change that could not be implemented without the union's approval. 
</P>
<P>
Conrail disagreed, saying that the new tests were only a minor change under 
terms of the Railway Labor Act and could be implemented unilaterally by the 
company. After a federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled for the union, 
Conrail appealed to the Supreme Court (Conrail vs. Railway Labor Executives, 
88-1). 
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry A. Blackmum said that Conrail's action was "arguably justified by 
the terms of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement" and therefore is not 
a major change in the contract itself. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling leaves the unions with the option of filing a grievance against 
Conrail and requesting that an arbitrator stop the testing. Had the unions 
prevailed Monday, testing would have been stopped until the unions agreed to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed, but not surprised," said Lawrence Mann, a lawyer for the 
rail unions. "The voting lineup was the same as in March." 
</P>
<P>
Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall dissented, as they did in 
the March ruling involving railroads. 
</P>
<P>
Union officers opposed the new drug-testing program, Mann said, because "we 
didn't get protections for accuracy and reliability." Congress is considering 
legislation that will require a second test of positive samples, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conrail operates in the Northeast, but railroads around the nation have adopted 
similar drug-testing programs, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Monday, the high court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rejected the government's appeal to reinstate the mail fraud conviction of 
former Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel (U.S. vs. Mandel, 88-1759). Mandel, who 
already has been released from prison, won a lower court ruling overturning his 
1977 conviction based on a 1987 Supreme Court decision on mail fraud. 
Government lawyers argued that the 1987 ruling should not be used 
retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Struck down a Connecticut law requiring that the price of beer sold there 
be as low as in any neighboring state. On a 6-3 vote, the justices said that 
such a law interferes with interstate commerce (Healey vs. Beer Institute, 
88-449). 
</P>
<P>
APPEAL REJECTED -- A mother can be tried for using only prayer to treat a dying 
child, the court ruled. Page 16.

THATCHER PARTY ROUTED IN EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives were reeling Monday after 
British voters, selecting delegates to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, 
France, gave the party its lowest share of a national ballot this century. 
</P>
<P>
As the final returns were announced, Thatcher aides tried to dismiss the 
convincing victory by the rival Labor Party as a routine protest vote midway 
through the prime minister's third successive term of office. 
</P>
<P>
Independent analysts acknowledged that the practical effect of the Tory defeat 
may be minimal because of the Strasbourg body's limited powers. But they said 
the psychological impact could be crucial, strongly confirming a buildup of 
Labor momentum first suggested in public opinion polls earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher avoided the press during a normal working day Monday, but she termed 
the election results "disappointing" in a handwritten note to the Conservative 
Party chairman, Peter Brooke. Brooke conceded that he "may well have made 
mistakes" during a heavily criticized election campaign and offered to resign. 
</P>
<P>
An ebullient Neil Kinnock, head of the Laborites, burst into song in his native 
Welsh language at an early morning champagne victory celebration. Labor had 
promoted the European elections as a referendum on Thatcher's policies. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Kinnock dismissed the possibility that the prime minister can still turn 
the tide with a widely anticipated reshuffling of her Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't got many aces to put in place of the jokers," Kinnock said. 
Referring to Thatcher, he added: "The one card in the pack that won't be 
reshuffled is the queen. And it is the queen that is their most basic 
weakness." 
</P>
<P>
Kinnock charged Thatcher's government with "arrogance" and "superficiality" and 
said of the prime minister's anti-socialist legislative program: "She has gone 
much too far." 
</P>
<P>
If the vote for delegates to the European Parliament were repeated in a British 
general election, according to an analysis by British Broadcasting Corp. 
television, Labor would emerge with a 26-seat parliamentary majority. That 
compares with a 100-seat majority that the Conservatives currently hold in the 
650-seat House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
Britons went to the polls to elect their representatives in the European 
Parliament last Thursday. But the last returns were not announced until late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The final count showed that Labor won more than 40% of the vote, up nearly 4% 
from its showing in the last European elections in 1984. Thatcher's 
Conservatives, meanwhile, got slightly more than 34% of the votes cast, down 
sharply from almost 41% five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The results mean that Labor will send 45 of Britain's 81 representatives to 
Strasbourg, compared to the Conservatives' 32. In 1984, the figures were just 
the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining four British seats went to small nationalist parties in Scotland 
and Northern Ireland. In all, there are 518 members of the Strasbourg assembly 
elected from 12 West European nations. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its limited powers, the European Parliament has been described by 
some as a toothless forum for inflated oratory or, at best, the conscience of 
the Continent. However, it is playing an increasingly visible role as Europe 
tries to tear down barriers to free movement of goods and people by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher has been an outspoken critic of those who want to see the European 
Community evolve into a political entity more akin to a "United States of 
Europe." She fears that leftists in the European Parliament might push through 
legislation that could undermine the anti-socialist political revolution she 
has engineered in Britain since first taking office in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, Labor activists hope to use their newly won clout in Strasbourg 
to put political pressure on Thatcher. One newly elected delegate gleefully 
predicted that he and his Labor colleagues at the European Parliament will make 
Thatcher "tear her hair out" in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deeply Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
The government's secretary of state for Scotland, Malcolm Rifkind, conceded in 
a television interview here that he was "deeply disappointed" after Scottish 
Conservatives lost the two Strasbourg seats they previously held. However, 
Rifkind stressed that the party has come back from mid-term defeats in the past 
to win "thumping" victories in general elections -- "and I have no doubt the 
same will happen this time." 
</P>
<P>
The government is not required to call a new general election until 1992, 
giving it as much as three years to turn the political situation around. 
Another ameliorating factor in the Strasbourg results was the unusually low 
voter turnout, 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rifkind's Cabinet colleague, Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson, took a 
more cautious line. 
</P>
<P>
"We've not done well," he said. "This is a warning to the government. . . . We 
have got to get inflation under control. We have got to stick together. We have 
got to make sure the electorate understands the consequences of electing a 
Labor government." 
</P>
<P>
What has been termed the Thatcher "economic miracle" has appeared to be 
unraveling of late, with inflation climbing to an 8.3% annual rate, the highest 
for any European Community nation. Also, labor strife seems to be on the rise, 
symbolized by the transportation unions that have been disrupting London train, 
bus and subway traffic with a series of 24-hour strikes throughout the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Former Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, a vocal and longstanding 
Thatcher critic, blamed the loss on "scare-mongering" by the prime minister. 
Her warnings against allowing the European Community new powers that could 
override national interests backfired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister has always underestimated the importance of the European 
Parliament," Heath added. "She treats it with contempt." 
</P>
<P>
The political left also made gains elsewhere in balloting for the Strasbourg 
assembly, apparently winning a wafer-thin parliamentary majority. Socialists 
picked up 15 seats in the European Parliament while the center-right parties, 
which had dominated, lost 33 seats. 
</P>
<P>
The one exception to the Parliament's leftward drift occurred in West Germany, 
where the far-right Republican Party, enlisting strong support in the 
conservative southern state of Bavaria, was projected to win six seats. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest winners, however, were the environmentalist Greens and their 
allies, which nearly doubled their Strasbourg representation to 39 seats from 
20 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Greens made an exceptionally strong showing in Britain as well, gaining 15% 
of the popular vote. However, they could not muster a plurality in any 
electoral district, and because of this country's winner-take-all system, 
Britain's Greens will not be represented in the new European Parliament.

1 CHEMICAL SKEWS DATA LISTING STATE FIRST IN TOXICS, OFFICIALS EXPLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A government survey released Monday showed that the volume of toxic pollutants 
emitted into the air, water and underground wells of California far exceeds 
that of any other state. 
</P>
<P>
But government officials said that finding represents an exaggerated picture of 
the state's performance, noting that the chemical principally responsible for 
the state's poor showing is no longer regarded by the Environmental Protection 
Agency as toxic. 
</P>
<P>
If that chemical -- sodium sulfate -- were excluded from the government 
assessment, the state's emissions of toxic substances would rank ninth in the 
nation, well behind Texas and Louisiana, which then would head the list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
26% of U.S. Total 
</P>
<P>
The assessment is contained in a government report that seeks for the first 
time to provide a national inventory of more than 300 cancer-causing and other 
hazardous chemicals released by manufacturing facilities into the air, land and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Of 22.6 billion pounds of toxic chemicals emitted into the environment in 1987, 
California was responsible for 5.8 billion pounds -- about 26% of the national 
total, the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
But about 90% of the state's total derived from a Central California plant's 
vast emission of sodium sulfate, which was removed last week from the 
government's most-hazardous list because of its apparent lack of toxicity. 
</P>
<P>
The facility, a Kerr-McGee chemical plant in Trona, Calif., 180 miles northeast 
of Los Angeles, takes sodium sulfate from dry Searles Lake and uses it in the 
production of a variety of products, including potash and soda ash. 
</P>
<P>
Among the products is sodium sulfate itself, which is known as salt cake and 
used in detergents and the paper-pulping process. But most of the chemical, 
about 3.7 billion pounds, is discharged into surface water each year, while an 
additional 1.5 billion pounds is injected into underground wells. 
</P>
<P>
Sodium sulfate was included in a list of more than 300 toxic chemicals that 
Congress required industry to monitor closely under a 1986 law. But senior EPA 
officials said Monday that they believe listing the chemical as toxic was a 
mistake by lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Basically Innocent' 
</P>
<P>
"We think sodium sulfate is basically innocent," Charles Elkins, director of 
the agency's toxics program, told reporters at a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Other toxic pollutants released in greater volumes in California than in most 
other states included toluene, arsenic, lead and lead compounds and a variety 
of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Separate EPA estimates of toxic emissions into land, air and water across the 
county had already been made public. But the release of the comprehensive 
"toxics release inventory" Monday marked the first time that the agency had 
analyzed many of its findings by geographical region. 
</P>
<P>
The survey will be released publicly through a new computer database maintained 
by the National Library of Medicine. Under the program, individuals can use 
library facilities to obtain information about toxic pollutants released at 
facilities near them. 
</P>
<P>
Among the available information will be estimates of the volume of toxins 
released at each site and an explanation of the health hazards each chemical 
may pose. 
</P>
<P>
No official assessment will be made of the health risk posed by toxic releases 
at individual industrial sites, even though preliminary EPA studies have 
identified more than 200 sites believed to pose a particularly high risk of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Agency officials emphasized Monday that such studies are not final but said 
that they believe it important for the raw information about toxic emissions to 
be made public. 
</P>
<P>
The new database, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said, is a "breakthrough 
that will facilitate citizen involvement in assessing the risks of toxic 
chemicals and developing community strategies to prevent pollution." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a separate list of major toxic polluters, based on EPA data and 
released by a leading environmental group Monday, lists a Compton plant among 
the nation's 30-largest sources of cancer-causing air pollutants by volume. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Crain Industries facility released more than 1 million pounds of 
methylene chloride, according to the report by the Natural Resources Defense 
Council. The chemical, a solvent used as a paint remover, is classified by the 
EPA as a "probable human carcinogen." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Crain could not be reached for comment Monday on the report. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the nation's top-ranking producer of toxic air pollutants -- an 
Eastman Kodak Co. facility in Rochester, N.Y. -- emitted nearly 9 million tons 
of methylene chloride that year, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The National Resources report is based on industry reports to the EPA. An 
earlier list of polluters, drawn from preliminary EPA data based on health 
risks from certain chemicals, included several Southern California facilities 
but not the Crain Industries plant.

INSURERS SEEK TO KEEP TERRITORIAL RATINGS; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 103 HEARING WARNED CHANGE COULD HIKE COSTS IN SUBURBAN, RURAL AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance industry representatives Monday urged state officials holding 
hearings on the implementation of Proposition 103 not to prevent companies from 
basing auto policy rates primarily on where a driver lives. 
</P>
<P>
Industry witnesses also said at the first of four days of state Insurance 
Department hearings that the companies should be given "maximum flexibility" in 
rate setting, despite a provision in the landmark insurance initiative making a 
driver's record the prime criterion. 
</P>
<P>
However, late in the day, one company, 20th Century, diverged from others, 
suggesting a formula whereby the state insurance commissioner could weight 
pricing factors according to a literal reading of proposition 103, thus 
radically reducing the importance of where a policyholder lives. 
</P>
<P>
Both department hearing officers and representatives of other companies 
expressed surprise that 20th Century, the state's sixth-largest seller of auto 
insurance, had become the first company to accept possible erosion of the 
so-called territorial rating system. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies warned that, while such a change would mean premium decreases 
for urban areas, which pay the highest rates under the territorial rating 
system, it could mean big increases for suburban and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
According to a controversial clause in Proposition 103, rates for auto 
insurance policies "shall be determined by application of the following factors 
in decreasing order of importance: (1) the insured's driving safety record, (2) 
the number of miles he or she drives annually, (3) the number of years of 
driving experience. . . , (4) such other factors as the commissioner may adopt 
by regulation." 
</P>
<P>
The fourth category could include not only territorial rating, but make and 
model of automobile and a driver's age, sex and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign that resulted in a narrow victory for Proposition 
103, the industry argued that the initiative would virtually end the 
territorial rating system and prompt rate increases in all but four of the 
state's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
After the election, however, some insurance company lawyers started trying to 
figure out how to interpret the rating clause in such a way as to change the 
basis by which rates are set as little as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the department, with Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie absent 
from the hearing but pledging to read all the testimony, began the hearing 
process of deciding how to interpret and apply the clause. 
</P>
<P>
For once, some consumer organizations, aware that a major move away from 
territorial rating would mean higher rates for many Californians, appeared 
hesitant to say what they thought the commissioner ought to do. Even Harvey 
Rosenfield, author of Proposition 103, sent written testimony suggesting that 
territorial rating ought to be allowed to continue in some form. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bill Press, representing the Los Angeles County Task Force on 
Automobile Liability, called for outright elimination of territorial rating. 
Press, a television commentator, is a prospective candidate for insurance 
commissioner when the post becomes an elective one next year. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers who testified took several positions. 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as four industry trade association representatives, urged that 
territorial rating be kept as a prime factor in setting rates, notwithstanding 
the language of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of some companies, particularly State Farm, the state's largest 
seller of auto insurance, urged several possible interpretations of the 
language of the clause that would, in effect, leave territorial rating and most 
other present rating criteria, such as make and model of car, in place, thus 
affecting prices little. 
</P>
<P>
The State Farm representatives handed out a series of estimates of what they 
think would happen if rates depended solely on driving record, miles driven and 
years of driving experience. 
</P>
<P>
According to the estimates, rural Northern Californians would pay 33% more for 
auto insurance, suburban and rural San Diego residents 19% more and San Jose 
residents 15% more, while Central Los Angeles and Beverly Hills residents would 
pay 62% less, Santa Monica and Malibu residents 44% less, Anaheim residents 15% 
less and Torrance residents 12% less. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm warned further that if make and model of car were no longer to be 
used as rating criteria, the owner of a Ford Escort in Central Los Angeles and 
Beverly Hills would pay 90% more to insure the vehicle, while the owner of a 
Rolls Royce would pay 92% less. It also suggested that, if age were no longer a 
permissible factor, adult drivers would pay 11% more and youthful ones 48% 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Such results would be highly unjust, the State Farm speakers said, suggesting 
three separate interpretations of Proposition 103 that they said would avoid 
such injustices. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm had by far the longest and most comprehensive presentation. By the 
time its representatives got on, all nine television channels that had been 
present earlier had left, as had most other members of the news media. 
</P>
<P>
One hearing officer commented afterward to The Times that it is inevitable that 
some "tortured" interpretation will eventually be used by the department, in 
order to prevent wild fluctuations of prices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Approach 
</P>
<P>
When 20th Century's representative spoke, he took a different approach, 
suggesting a weighting formula whereby Proposition 103 could be applied without 
a tortured interpretation of language. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Curley, senior vice president of 20th Century, said that Gillespie could 
order 30% of pricing determination be based on a driver's safety record, 25% on 
miles driven, 20% on years of driving experience, 15% on where a policy holder 
lives, 7% on type of car driven and 3% on the number of cars in a household. He 
did not discuss what such a system would do to prices. 
</P>
<P>
Other insurers in the room were highly critical of such an approach. They said 
the state does not keep good enough records or keep records long enough to give 
solid indications of what a driver's safety record really is.

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great cities change slowly, over decades, and so it is difficult to name the 
year when San Francisco finally lost its war with Los Angeles. Perhaps it was 
1958, when the O'Malleys saw the future and moved the Dodgers south instead of 
north. Perhaps 1971, when the Fillmore closed its doors. Or 1986, when the Bank 
of America fell from grace, revealing San Francisco to be a fading center of 
high finance. 
</P>
<P>
One can argue about these things, but there is no doubt that one of the great 
urban rivalries of this century has now ended. San Francisco is slowly being 
drawn into orbit as a satellite of Los Angeles. This may be regarded with a 
sense of vindication or with some sadness, but the truth of it can be seen 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Just go to The Top of the Mark, a place that once symbolized so much about San 
Francisco. This grand old room occupies the highest floor of the Mark Hopkins 
hotel, which in turn sits at the very pinnacle of Nob Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Once the city's banking and railroad barons came here to survey their kingdom 
and dance away the night. They don't come here anymore, of course. The Top of 
the Mark is now a quick stop for the tourist buses. 
</P>
<P>
From the windows, as big as movie screens, you can look over the city that only 
a century ago was the unchallenged center of the Pacific slope. Look north and 
you can see the city's port, a place now empty of ships, the old docks filled 
instead with lobster restaurants and bric-a-brac stores. The ships themselves 
have long since gone to Oakland and Long Beach. You will nowhere see the name 
of Crocker Bank, one of the city's first great banks, because Crocker no longer 
exists. The Southern Pacific Railroad, the original junkyard dog of 
corporations, is operated out of Chicago now. Del Monte Foods is controlled 
from Florida. The once imperial Bank of America has become a tenant in the 
granite-faced skyscraper it formerly owned. 
</P>
<P>
No one is claiming that San Francisco is about to become another Cleveland. The 
streets of the city still are filled with people of money munching bran muffins 
as they push their way through the crowd. South of Market Street new hotels are 
abuilding. No, the decline of San Francisco is another sort. It has to do with 
the loss of mass, of urban throw weight. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Walker, a geographer at UC Berkeley, studies the rise and fall of 
cities. One day recently he ticked off the reasons why San Francisco should 
never have lost its rivalry with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco had a great, natural port, it had water supplies, had railroads 
and banks filled with money from the gold rush. Los Angeles had none of this. 
And yet Los Angeles now completely dominates the western United States, and San 
Francisco has been reduced to a regional center. No one really understands how 
this happened. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there are probably lots of reasons for San Francisco's fall, but I 
have a favorite theory. It has to do with urban narcissism and how that can 
lead a city into dissipation. There is nothing wrong with municipal 
handsomeness, of course, and some cities -- Paris, for example, or even Seattle 
-- have managed to accept their beauty without becoming obsessed by it. Cities, 
like people, need a reason to get up in the morning and these cities never 
forgot that truth. San Francisco did. 
</P>
<P>
Have you ever listened to San Franciscans congratulating each other simply for 
living in the city? Or the stories they tell about New Yorkers or 
Washingtonians who threw it all over and came here to live on salaries half 
their previous size? Living in San Francisco is like going out with the 
prettiest girl in high school, the one who has convinced herself she doesn't 
have to be smart or know computers or shoot pool. All she has to do is remain 
forever pretty. 
</P>
<P>
But prettiness is all about staying the same, about dreading change, which is 
what San Francisco did while other cities were grabbing the future. San 
Francisco didn't bother with containerized shipping, and the port moved to 
Oakland. Trade with Japan was ignored and the Japanese car companies all put 
their American headquarters in Los Angeles. The city didn't woo the aging J. 
Paul Getty when it had a chance and the old man built the richest museum in the 
world in Malibu. I have my own favorite milestone in all this. It is 1977, the 
year tourism became the largest business in the city. This was the point when 
San Francisco turned prettiness into a profession. It was the point of no 
return. From 1977 on, the city's old roles ceased to matter and it began the 
sordid game of wooing outsiders to pay its keep. This city, once the ruler of 
all it surveyed, had joined the ranks of Honolulu and Las Vegas.

President Roh Tae Woo on Monday threatened the six economic ministers in his 
Cabinet with dismissal if they fail to resolve South Korea's growing economic 
problems. The threat came as the government lowered its forecast for economic 
growth and declared war on spiraling wages. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting of ruling party and government leaders, Roh -- whose promise in 
June, 1987, to transform South Korea from authoritarian to democratic 
government unleashed demands for large wage increases -- ordered the ministers 
to overcome labor strife, stagnant exports and sluggish investments "with a 
resolve to resign en masse if you fail." 
</P>
<P>
"If present economic difficulties persist," Roh told the group, "grave problems 
will appear next year . . . and our economic achievements of the past 30 years 
will burst like a bubble." 
</P>
<P>
Roh expressed his concern over the economy -- the increase in the gross 
national product fell to 5.7% in the first three months after three consecutive 
years of more than 12% growth -- as Deputy Prime Minister Cho Soon presented 
lower forecasts for the year. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint news conference with the other five economic ministers, Cho said 
that since late 1987, wages have skyrocketed 62.5%, far surpassing productivity 
gains of 32.2%. He said that "the outburst of demands for compensation by 
workers is reaching a dangerous point." 
</P>
<P>
Cho, who also heads the Economic Planning Board, said the government is 
determined to hold future annual wage increases to under 10%. In return, he 
promised that the government would, in effect, freeze the foreign exchange rate 
at its present level of about 666 won to the U.S. dollar. Cho said the won, the 
value of which appreciated 15.8% last year and 2.3% through the first five 
months of this year, will be stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Policy Promise 
</P>
<P>
Although Korean officials, including Cho, have said previously that they would 
halt the appreciation of the won, which makes Korean exports more costly in 
dollar terms, Cho's making the pledge in exchange for wage restraints elevated 
it to a policy promise to the Korean people. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze promised to exacerbate a continuing dispute with the United States, 
which had a trade deficit of $8.6 billion with South Korea in 1988. Only last 
month, Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford told the Senate that the United 
States will pursue negotiations to obtain a commitment for further appreciation 
of the won. 
</P>
<P>
Washington was also reported to be demanding that South Korea adopt a more 
market-oriented foreign exchange system in place of its government-controlled 
calculation of the won's value based on a "basket" of foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech to party and government leaders, Roh complained that "production 
setbacks caused by labor disputes may be directly to blame for the difficult 
economic situation. But the never-ending demands of even doctors, teachers, 
bankers, clergymen and journalists -- not to mention farmers and laborers -- 
have become a key element aggravating the economy." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Trade and Industry Ministry announced that labor strife had cost 
the nation $4.7 billion in production losses, including $1.1 billion in 
exports, through June 12. Between January and May, exports in dollar terms rose 
only 6.7%, compared to 29.6% in the same period last year. In terms of volume, 
exports declined 4.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Cho announced that the government will offer businesses a 10% tax reduction for 
investment in domestically produced factory equipment and a 3% cut for imported 
equipment for one year starting July 1. More loans to finance exports were 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming both the wage spiral and the won's appreciation for diminishing South 
Korea's international competitiveness, Cho said the government is lowering its 
target for real growth to 7.5% this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new goal was only half a percentage point lower than the original 
forecast, it is the first time in four years that the government has been 
forced to lower the estimate. In 1986, 1987 and 1988, when the South Korean 
economy grew by more than 12% a year, and again this year, the government had 
forecast that real growth would be 8%, after subtracting for the effects of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Cho also lowered estimates for surpluses in trade and in current accounts, the 
sum of trade and such non-trade transactions as shipping, tourism and 
insurance. The trade surplus, which amounted to $8.9 billion last year, was 
expected to fall to $4 billion, while the current accounts balance will decline 
to $8 billion from last year's $14.3 billion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investment Off Sharply 
</P>
<P>
After rising 12.2% last year, the economy suddenly slumped to 5.7% growth in 
the first three months of this year. Investment was also off sharply, to 2% 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
The new goals lowered expectations for exports by $2 billion to a target of $68 
billion. That sum still represents an increase of 12% but pales in contrast to 
a robust 28% spurt last year. 
</P>
<P>
Cho did not spell out how the government would hold future wage increases to 
within 10%, and he stopped short of reinstituting government guidelines for 
wages. Until Roh's promise to democratize South Korea, made to quell violent 
anti-government demonstrations when he was a presidential candidate, South 
Korea's authoritarian governments had actively intervened in labor-management 
negotiations to suppress wage increases. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Cho said, a "national wage coordination council" composed of labor, 
management and government representatives will be established "to suggest 
reasonable wage increases in line with rises in productivity." He also pledged 
that the government this year would restrain to within 10% both the increase in 
the price it pays farmers for rice and the wage increases it approves for 
bureaucrats and employees of state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breaking the Cycle 
</P>
<P>
He appealed to South Koreans to cooperate to "break the vicious cycle of high 
wages, high prices and low economic growth," and he warned that a continuation 
of 20% annual pay increases would spur both inflation and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, South Korean workers received wages below those in all three of its 
major Asian trading rivals. But last year, its average monthly wage of $633 was 
tops among the so-called Four Tigers. The average was $598 in Taiwan, $547 in 
Singapore and $544 in Hong Kong, the Economic Planning Board said. 
</P>
<P>
Ro Sung Tae, director of research coordination at the government-financed Korea 
Development Institute, predicted in an interview that failure of the economy to 
show significant recovery by the July-September quarter would induce the 
government to initiate pump-priming measures and devalue the won to promote 
exports.

U.S. TO EMPHASIZE VERIFICATION MEASURES AT NEW MISSILE TALKS IN GENEVA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In one of several modifications to U.S. proposals for a treaty reducing 
long-range nuclear weapons, President Bush announced Monday that the United 
States will propose speeding up discussions on verification measures to police 
compliance with any new accord. 
</P>
<P>
Bush held out the possibility of putting some of the verification measures into 
effect even before U.S. and Soviet negotiators reach agreement at the Strategic 
Arms Reduction Talks in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The President plans to outline this and other relatively minor changes in the 
U.S. bargaining position to congressional leaders today, a senior 
Administration official said. U.S. negotiators then will lay out Bush's new 
proposals Wednesday at the first formal negotiating session in Geneva since 
Bush took office in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Round Under Way 
</P>
<P>
A new round of talks opened Monday with an 80-minute procedural meeting, after 
which Richard R. Burt, who succeeded Max M. Kampelman as chief U.S. negotiator, 
said he had described Bush's "overall approach to arms control, emphasizing the 
President's commitment to reducing the risk of nuclear war." 
</P>
<P>
Burt, former U.S. ambassador to West Germany, added that both sides have agreed 
to "maintain the confidentiality of the negotiations" by not publicizing 
details and their give-and-take. 
</P>
<P>
The new Soviet negotiator, Yuri K. Nazarkin, pronounced himself "satisfied" 
with the first meeting. Burt described his Soviet counterpart, who replaced 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov, as a "low-key problem solver." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, several Administration officials said that tentative decisions 
on some of the major obstacles to a strategic arms treaty, such as whether to 
abandon U.S. opposition to mobile land-based missiles, also were made over the 
weekend by Bush and his top aides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congress to Be Consulted 
</P>
<P>
They will be the basis for consultations with Congress members in coming days 
before being "fine tuned" and announced over the next week or two, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see what Congress is prepared to do," said another senior official. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's statement Monday suggested that the Administration is prepared to 
abandon its opposition to mobile land-based missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Bush repeatedly stressed the goal of greater "stability" in the strategic 
balance. And one way to enhance stability is to permit mobile missiles, because 
they are relatively secure from enemy attack. There is less incentive to "use 
them or lose them" in time of crisis, in the jargon of nuclear strategists, 
than there is for fixed missiles, whose silos are more vulnerable to surprise 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is split on which kind of mobile missile to build, the 10-warhead MX 
that would be moved on railroad cars, or the single-warhead Midgetman that 
would be carried on truck-like vehicles. The Soviets already operate both types 
of weapons, but the United States has neither. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has asked Congress for funds to deploy the MX on rails while 
continuing to develop the Midgetman. The Administration wants authorization for 
one or both weapons before it changes its opposition to mobile missiles at the 
negotiating table, lest it remain without either weapon while the Soviets are 
free to deploy both. 
</P>
<P>
The White House has not yet begun such consultations with Congress, however, 
according to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.). 
</P>
<P>
Aspin said that the Administration could get a commitment of full support for 
both the MX and the Midgetman. But he urged the Administration to craft a new 
strategic arms proposal "to ensure that if we don't build one kind of mobile, 
the Soviets couldn't either." 
</P>
<P>
In its recent reviews of arms control policy, the White House has been looking 
for a new approach to the arms talks that would place a Bush stamp on the U.S. 
position and take advantage of the Soviets' apparent willingness to accept arms 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in his announcement that much of the 400 pages of draft treaty 
already negotiated would stand. But he added that "modifications will be 
proposed in some cases," and he "reserved the right to introduce new 
initiatives aimed at further enhancing security and strategic stability." 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of agreeing on procedures to verify compliance 
with a new treaty. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States will also propose that the two sides make a special effort 
to agree on, and to begin implementing as soon as possible, certain 
verification and stability measures drawn from proposals that both sides have 
already advanced," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, insisted that this does not mean that 
verification will have priority at the talks, and he emphasized that agreement 
on such measures is not a condition for completing a treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on verification stems from the Senate's suspicions that the 
Soviets may cheat on the recent treaty banning ground-launched, medium-range 
nuclear missiles. The Senate ratified the treaty last year, but only after 
extensive debate. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a START treaty dead on arrival on Capitol Hill," said Ronald F. 
Lehman, director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. 
</P>
<P>
But critics fear that the focus on verification, whether intentional or not, 
will divert attention from the remaining obstacles to a treaty. 
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, Nazarkin, the Soviet negotiator, said that from the Soviet 
perspective, "issue number one" at the current session would be linking the 
proposed 50% cuts in the long-range missiles to the strict observance of the 
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Toth reported from Washington and Tuohy from Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STRATEGIC ARMS REDUCTION TALKS: STARTING AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-Soviet talks on cutting long-range nuclear forces have resumed in Geneva 
after a six-month recess. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS: 
</P>
<P>
New chief delegates are Richard Burt and Yuri Nazarkin. Burt, a military expert 
and former U.S. ambassador to West Germany, replaces Max Kampelman. Nazarkin, 
who has been Soviet envoy at 40-nation Conference on Disarmament dealing with 
chemical weapons, replaces Yuli Vorontsov. 
</P>
<P>
THE AIM: 
</P>
<P>
START -- or Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -- is intended to cover nuclear 
weapons with which superpowers can strike each other's home territory, 
including: sea-and land-based ballistic missiles and heavy bombers. 
</P>
<P>
In this round, delegates likely to first review agreements contained in 
400-page draft text that commits both sides to cuts of up to 50% in strategic 
nuclear arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
PREVIOUS PROGRESS: 
</P>
<P>
Among the agreements in earlier rounds are lowered ceilings of 6,000 nuclear 
warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles -- missiles and bombers -- for each side. 
</P>
<P>
STICKING POINTS: 
</P>
<P>
Among remaining disputes are mobile land-based missiles, the counting of cruise 
missiles carried by bombers, sea-launched cruise missiles and the Pentagon's 
space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars," missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
NEW PROPOSALS: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. to suggest speeding up discussions on verification measures and putting 
some of those measures into effect before final agreement on a treaty is 
reached.

HONG KONG OFFICIAL WARNS BRITAIN TO KEEP DOORS OPEN OR RISK CHAOS

A senior adviser to the Hong Kong government warned Monday of chaotic 
consequences if more than 3 million Hong Kong people are denied the right to 
settle in Britain after the colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very difficult for the British administration to run this place 
(if the) population is resentful of being deprived of the one thing that would 
give them confidence," Lydia Dunn, the colony's most senior politician, told a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, a member of the Executive Council, which advises Hong Kong's governor, 
called on Britain to fulfill a "moral obligation and a constitutional 
responsibility" to the people of Hong Kong. She said confidence in the 
territory was severely hurt by the bloody suppression of China's pro-democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn and senior legislator Allen Lee leave for London next Monday to lobby 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and members of Parliament for what they call 
an "insurance policy" for the 3.25 million British subjects here. 
</P>
<P>
She said there would not be a mass exodus of Hong Kong people to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that Hong Kong people do not want to leave Hong Kong. Hong Kong is our 
home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Special British passports available to 3.25 million people in Hong Kong do not 
entitle the holders to live in Britain. The rest of the colony's 6 million 
people were not born here and are not entitled to any British passport.

<P>
Lu Xun, Chinese writer, 1926 
</P>
<P>
Along with the pageant of arrests, interrogations, confessions and handcuffings 
shown night after night on state television, there have also appeared scenes of 
raids on printing presses in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The machinery is shown being pulled out of dark rooms in monotonous housing 
projects and loaded on army trucks -- another example of the relentless pursuit 
of "counterrevolutionaries" by security forces. 
</P>
<P>
The raids are basically an effort to monopolize the spread of information. The 
government is trying to ensure that its version of violence during the June 3-4 
assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in and around Tian An Men Square is the 
only one. 
</P>
<P>
The state-run press is also being brought into line in a clampdown of a 
different sort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical Reporter 
</P>
<P>
During a television broadcast Monday, an announcer read a letter from a 
reporter criticizing notions of a free press that surfaced here in the days and 
weeks preceding the attack on Tian An Men. 
</P>
<P>
After viewing the official version of events that have been broadcast here 
nonstop since June 4, the reporter repented his participation in pro-democracy 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
"What is freedom of the press?" he asked in his letter. "Is freedom of the 
press meant to be counterrevolutionary? Is freedom of the press to subvert the 
government? In the whole world, is there any nation that permits this kind of 
press freedom? 
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, the media can curse the President but absolutely not 
overturn the government." 
</P>
<P>
The statement is evidently meant to put an end to resistance by many Chinese 
journalists to martial law. Some reporters had participated in anti-government 
demonstrations before June 3-4. During some demonstrations, the usually tight 
reins on television were loosened and reporters took the opportunity to show 
all of China unimpeded scenes from the square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Virtual Strike 
</P>
<P>
Others have reportedly been on a virtual strike since the attack, in which the 
army killed hundreds, perhaps thousands of demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The tightening of controls on the press and underground publishing will 
undoubtedly make it difficult for protest literature to surface in the wake of 
the Tian An Men killings. 
</P>
<P>
In 20th-Century China, such protest writings have a history of appearing in 
response to similar political cataclysms -- the May 4, 1919, student movement 
against the Qing Dynasty, for instance, and the series of student protests 
against the Nationalist government in the 1920s and 1930s, many of which were 
brutally suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, many students found in their demonstrations an echo of the May 4, 
1919, movement. A song written by Beijing students last month ended with the 
chorus: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold high the banner of May 4th. 
</P>
<P>
 The May 4th spirit will forever live. 
</P>
<P>
 Uproot feudalism and bureaucracy 
</P>
<P>
 From the motherland!" 
</P>
<P>
Often, links to such past struggles are forged by allusion, a favorite literary 
device employed by Chinese writers. 
</P>
<P>
After the attack around Tian An Men Square and on Changan Avenue, Beijing's 
main east-west thoroughfare, students at several campuses in Beijing hung 
banners bearing the inscription: "Blood debts must be repaid in kind." 
</P>
<P>
The slogan alluded to a line from Lu Xun, one of this century's leading Chinese 
writers. He penned the words in response to a massacre of 40 anti-government 
student demonstrators in 1926 at the hands of the Nationalist government. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the conclusion of an incident, but a new beginning," Lu wrote of 
that crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
For many Chinese, the literary link to the past is as important as possession 
of the square itself: It is the difference between viewing the deaths of 
hundreds of demonstrators and their supporters as an isolated incident or 
seeing it as part of a temporarily frustrated but still vital tide. 
</P>
<P>
However, getting rid of the printing presses will at least narrow the chances 
that essays, poems, and stories will circulate freely inside China. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, especially after the Democracy Wall movement of 1979, writings 
published abroad kept the literature alive. Dissident words from this spring 
are already seeping from China into Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Chai Ling, a Beijing Teachers University student who was one of the leaders of 
the movement, sent a recording of her thoughts to Hong Kong before she went 
into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
"What can we do to bring back those students who were sacrificed?" she 
wondered. "Their souls will always remain on Changan Avenue. They'll never come 
back. Some of them were very, very young. They'll never come back." 
</P>
<P>
Her words, too, also recalled protest literature past. Compare, for example, a 
poem by writer Wen Yiduo written after the deaths of students at Tian An Men in 
1926: 
</P>
<P>
 "See there, whose children are those? 
</P>
<P>
 They're hardly adolescents, are they? 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
 Aren't those bayonet wounds on their heads? 
</P>
<P>
 By tomorrow, the city of Beijing will be full of ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
The government seems acutely aware of the significance of such allusions and 
has tried to separate Tian An Men, 1989, from repressions of the past. 
Officials insist that no one was killed on Tian An Men Square during a night of 
bloodshed that ended at dawn June 4. That someone might have been killed 
elsewhere seems not to matter. By government admission, people were killed 
along the length of Changan Avenue, the boulevard that cuts across the north 
end of the square -- although the official account distinguishes between "the 
people," who were killed by accident, and "thugs" and "counterrevolutionary 
rioters" who were gunned down in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Any rival account is blasted as "rumor-mongering." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Chinese believe this account may not be the point; it puts them on 
notice about what they are supposed to believe. Already in Beijing, people 
willing to discuss the Tian An Men massacre sometimes begin their replies with, 
"I have heard a lot of rumors." It is one way to avoid taking a stand.

HIGH COURT PERMITS PROSECUTION IN FAITH-HEALING DEATH 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court, rejecting an appeal by a Christian Scientist from 
California, indicated Monday that the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of 
religion does not prevent the criminal prosecution of a mother who used only 
prayer to treat her dying child. 
</P>
<P>
The justices let stand a unanimous state Supreme Court ruling that last 
November cleared the way for trial on manslaughter and child endangerment 
charges of a Sacramento woman whose 4-year-old daughter died of acute 
meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Review Cases 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the high court has not specifically ruled on whether a faith 
healer is exempted on religious grounds from government prosecution, but the 
justices recently have refused to review a variety of state prosecutions 
involving parents who fail to get medical care for seriously ill children. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a second California case, the justices said that the California 
Highway Patrol may not be sued for damages for the rape and murder of a young 
woman by a CHP officer. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the high court ruled 5 to 4 that neither a state nor its officials 
may be sued in state court for violations of a citizen's constitutional rights. 
Apparently applying that ruling to a case growing out of the 1982 murder of 
23-year-old Robin Bishop, the high court Monday dismissed a $100-million suit 
against the CHP and its officials for failing to supervise the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Both cases were rejected without comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the religion case (Walker vs. Superior Court of Sacramento, 88-1471), the 
high court appears to accept the view of the state Supreme Court that the 
Constitution fully protects religious beliefs but not religious conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the justices let stand a state court decision calling for a trial 
on whether the followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon used fraud in recruiting 
new church members. Lawyers for Moon had argued that the First Amendment's 
guarantee of the "free exercise" of religion forbade such a trial. 
</P>
<P>
In the case dismissed Monday, attorneys for Laurie Walker of Sacramento argued 
that the First Amendment does not permit government prosecutors to decide 
whether she acted reasonably in relying on prayer, rather than doctors, to cure 
her ailing daughter. They contended also that California law is unclear because 
one section of the state code was amended in 1976 to exempt parents from child 
neglect charges if they relied on "treatment through spiritual means." 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1984, Walker's daughter, Shauntay, developed a fever and began 
vomiting. On the fourth day, she developed a stiff neck, a symptom of 
meningitis. Ignoring neighbors' pleas to get medical treatment for her child, 
Walker relied on prayers by a Christian Scientist. After 17 days, the child 
died of bacterial meningitis, an infection that can be cured with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was charged with involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment. If 
convicted, she could face up to six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the state Supreme Court said that Walker's religious beliefs, 
although sincere, do not exempt her from prosecution. "Parents have no right to 
free exercise of religion at the price of a child's life," Justice Stanley Mosk 
wrote for the court. The appeal of that decision was rejected Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the highway patrol case (Bishop vs. Gwaltney, 88-527), the parents of Bishop 
contended that CHP officers were aware of the fact that patrolman George 
Michael Gwaltney stopped attractive female motorists and tried to force them to 
have sex with him. On Jan. 11, 1982, Bishop was driving from Los Angeles to Las 
Vegas on Interstate 15 when she was stopped, raped and murdered. 
</P>
<P>
After two mistrials in state courts, Gwaltney was tried in a federal court, 
convicted and sentenced to 90 years in prison. California permits suits against 
its own officials but, because of the delays in Gwaltney's prosecution, 
Bishop's parents waited too long under state law to file such a claim against 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of cases, the Supreme Court has allowed local government officials 
to be sued for violating constitutional rights, but not state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's 5-4 ruling in a Michigan case (Will vs. Michigan State Police, 
87-1207) closed the door to damage suits against state officials that allege 
violations of federal constitutional rights.

The U.S. Supreme Court Monday refused to hear the case of author Margaret 
Randall, who renounced her U.S. citizenship in 1967 when living in Mexico and 
is fighting in court to regain it. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'm disappointed," Randall said of the court's opinion. "But 
eventually we will win because there are many people in this country who 
believe in freedom of speech. It is part of our culture as Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Randall's fight to regain her citizenship has been tied up in immigration 
courts since 1985, when Al Giugni, the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
director in El Paso, Tex., ruled that she could be deported because of her 
communist-leaning writings. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court rejected Randall's appeal to hear her case on the aspect of 
its constitutionality only. Her lawyers were arguing that the real issue is not 
whether the author and photographer could remain legally in the United States 
but whether there is freedom of speech in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Randall, 52, was born in New York City, moved to Mexico in 1961 and married a 
Mexican national. She said she renounced her American citizenship in 1967 in 
order to get a job in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The former faculty member of the University of New Mexico and author of more 
than 40 books moved from Mexico to Cuba, where she lived for 11 years, gaining 
an international reputation as an advocate of women's rights in the Third 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Randall moved from Cuba to Nicaragua in 1981 to write about women in that 
country. In 1984, she returned to Albuquerque on a vistor's visa to be with her 
elderly parents.

PROSECUTORS URGE PRISON TERM FOR NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Government prosecutors declared Monday that former White House aide Oliver L. 
North "has not indicated one iota of remorse" and should go to prison for his 
conviction on three felony charges in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
In legal papers filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell four days 
before North is scheduled to be sentenced, prosecutors charged that North sees 
himself "as being above the law and beyond reproach" and, in making public 
appearances around the country, "continues to profit from his notoriety." 
</P>
<P>
Convicted on three of nine felony counts last month, the retired Marine 
lieutenant colonel could receive up to 10 years in prison and $750,000 in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's defense attorney, declined comment on the 
prosecutors' statement. However, Sullivan has been submitting material to the 
court under seal to argue leniency for North and will make a public statement 
before Gesell imposes sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notice of Appeal 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan also has served notice that he is appealing North's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
In their sentencing memorandum, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and three 
associates who tried the 12-week case told Gesell that "the most striking thing 
about North's posture on the eve of sentencing is his insistence that he has 
done nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
They cited North's post-trial claim that the jury's verdict represented "a 
partial vindication" of his conduct, and that he will "continue the fight" 
until he is exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the prosecutors said, "North's lack of remorse is particularly 
troubling in view of the fact that he continues to travel throughout the 
country, like a politician on the stump, giving speeches and discoursing on his 
defiance of Congress." 
</P>
<P>
North's appearances have commanded an average fee of $25,000 each. His 
associates say that the proceeds, together with contributions toward a legal 
defense fund, are being used to defray legal bills estimated at $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that an unspecified "term of incarceration is appropriate and 
necessary," the prosecution's statement urged Gesell to "consider the 
seriousness of North's abuse of the public trust, the need for deterrence, 
North's failure to accept personal responsibility for his actions, his lack of 
remorse and his perjury on the witness stand." 
</P>
<P>
Although North was charged with perjury, he was not convicted of that charge. 
He was found guilty of altering and destroying top-secret documents, helping to 
mislead Congress and illegally accepting the gift of a $13,800 home security 
system. 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution contended that "with supreme faith in his ability to 
deceive, North took the witness stand and perjured himself" with a false story 
claiming that he had a cash box at home and had not pocketed any Contra cash 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
North "apparently sees nothing wrong with alteration and destruction of 
official national security records," the prosecutors added, describing such 
crimes as "designed to protect himself and his associates, not the national 
security." 
</P>
<P>
Stressing the deterrent effect of a prison term, the government's statement 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"After a nonpolitical trial and a nonpolitical verdict, the court in its 
sentence should alert all government officials that such activities are indeed 
unlawful and that, if officials engaging in such conduct are caught and 
convicted, the punishment will be severe." North was "not a scapegoat," the 
statement concluded, and he "cannot simply rely on real or imagined 
authorization of illegal conduct and expect to escape responsibility."

BUSH SALUTES 3 SCHOOLS' DRUG FIGHT

President Bush saluted three California schools Monday for their efforts to 
provide a drug-free learning environment for children. He singled out the Live 
Oak Elementary School and declared that "every school in this country can be 
safe and drug-free." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Live Oak school in Sutter County, Bush also honored the 
Bella Vista Elementary School in Shasta County, and the Parkway Middle School 
in La Mesa near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony in the Rose Garden, Bush painted an idyllic portrait of Live Oak: 
"The residents fill only five pages of the phone book. One traffic light. No 
hospital, no jail. Just a drugstore, a few restaurants, a post office." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "drugs got into the school and things went downhill fast," until 
the school developed "a drug-free education program that is gradually 
influencing the face of the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
Honoring teachers, principals, community leaders, parents and students from 
schools throughout the nation, Bush said: "You understand that students have a 
right to learn in drug-free schools." 
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, in a commencement speech at Cheltenham High School in a suburb of 
Philadelphia, Bush exhorted the 331 graduating seniors to show the same 
idealism and devotion to country that led Chinese students to confront armed 
soldiers and die for democracy.

WILDCAT STRIKES IDLE COAL MINES IN NINE STATES 
</P>

Wildcat strikes hit coal fields in four more states Monday, keeping a third of 
the nation's union miners out of work despite a back-to-work request by United 
Mine Workers leadership, a union official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Telegrams have gone out," said UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts, breaking the 
union's long silence on the impromptu strikes that have shut down more than 300 
mines. "I'm sure that that has taken place throughout the union." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the order, mines in Alabama, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio were hit 
Monday for the first time, bringing out 5,000 more United Mine Workers members 
in a sympathy walkout for striking Pittston Coal Group employees. 
</P>
<P>
That brought to more than 27,000 the number of miners on strike against coal 
operators in nine states, not including the 1,800 picketing Pittston in a 
contract dispute. The UMW has about 80,000 active members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the telegrams were sent because the miners are violating a 
national contract signed by UMW members. He said the union must enforce that 
pact. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a serious situation," said Jeffrey W. Weber, a spokesman for AMAX Coal 
Co.'s mine in Keensburg, Ill., where 655 miners joined the walkout Monday. "If 
you look at the big picture, it's very counterproductive to the future of these 
miners." 
</P>
<P>
As has been the case with previous walkouts, the UMW gave companies no official 
reason for the wildcat strikes, but most presumed they were related to the 
Pittston dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said Monday in an interview from Tazewell, Va., that the union presumed 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just speculation on our part as to why they're out, but people from the 
field are very upset on fines that have been assessed against the union" for 
civil disobedience in the Pittston strike, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia was taken off the wildcat list Monday when 794 Island Creek Coal Co. 
employees returned to work at mines in Buchanan County. They had been out since 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back in full swing," said Island Creek spokesman Noel Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the wildcat strike's end in Virginia, other industry officials pointed 
to the new walkouts and said there was no way to expect an end to the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's pretty unpredictable," said Steve Anderson, a spokesman for 
Westmoreland Coal Co., which had 850 workers out last week but only 100 -- all 
in West Virginia -- on picket lines Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider the expansion over the weekend, I find it hard to believe 
(that it's ending)." 
</P>
<P>
The more than 27,000 miners off work included 16,000 in West Virginia, 3,900 in 
Alabama, 2,500 in Pennsylvania, 1,750 in Indiana, 1,270 in Kentucky, 1,100 in 
Ohio, 650 in Illinois, 338 in Missouri and 200 in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
The unauthorized walkouts began last week after a UMW rally in Charleston, 
S.C., to protest Pittston's failure to sign a nationwide contract and to 
protest fines and jail terms assessed against union members in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Pittston wants its own contract that would include mandatory overtime, Sunday 
work and a cut in pension benefits. The UMW insists that the company sign the 
national contract, which would require Pittston to pay into the national 
pension fund and keep mines closed on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,600 UMW employees walked off their Pittston jobs in Virginia and West 
Virginia on April 5 after working more than 14 months without a contract. The 
strike spread to Pittston's Kentucky operations Monday, idling an additional 
200 UMW members.

Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) said Monday that he "routinely" sends 
letters to African and Caribbean heads of state asking them to employ 
black-owned firms like that of his friend and campaign contributor Mamadi 
Diane. 
</P>
<P>
But he strongly denied a report in the Journal of Commerce that he hinted at 
possible retaliation in a letter to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni last 
August complaining that Diane's Washington-based firm, Amex International, 
Inc., was not hired as an agent for U.S. food aid sent to Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Dymally has a major role in 
the allocation of $1.5 billion in assistance under the "Food for Peace" 
program, which provides grain and other commodities to needy nations at 
concessionary loan rates. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no apologies for advocating employment of Diane, head of the 
Zaire American Research Institute, who accompanied him to Zaire on one of two 
trips last year that were paid for by that African nation. Diane, he said, is a 
friend he has known since coming to Washington as a member of Congress in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Diane contributed $1,500 and his wife gave $1,000 to Dymally's 1988 
congressional campaign. "A lot of people contribute to my campaign," Dymally 
said in a telephone interview. "Do you expect (Republican Whip) Newt Gingrich 
to contribute to my campaign?" 
</P>
<P>
Dymally said he and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus regularly 
try to help black business firms. 
</P>
<P>
"Who in this country is going to help a black firm in trouble? A white 
congressman from Louisiana?" he asked. "If a black member of Congress can't do 
it, who can?" 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated last Aug. 24 to Museveni, Dymally protested the decision by 
Uganda not to select Amex, a firm that now is the agent for Zaire and three 
other African nations in the food aid program. Uganda selected a white-owned 
firm to handle its shipments of food aid. Agents buy the food, arrange for 
transportation and are paid a percentage of the cargo's value as a commission, 
a spokesman for the Agency for International Development said. 
</P>
<P>
"President, it is our hope that you will intervene in this matter and instruct 
your Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs and the Ambassador of Uganda in 
Washington, D.C., to correct this regrettable situation and consider nominating 
Amex as Uganda's agent in the U.S. for all food aid-related programs," Dymally 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Urging pan-African solidarity throughout the world, he suggested that hiring 
Amex would benefit Uganda's cause in Congress and in the executive branch of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to assume, for instance, that when African-Americans are supported, 
they in turn are compelled to respond more appropriately to their duty of 
supporting the efforts of African countries in Washington, through their 
contacts with the Congress and the Administration," Dymally wrote the African 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was an implication of retaliation if Uganda did not retain Amex, 
Dymally replied: "Of course not." And he said: "These letters are sent out 
routinely to heads of state. I met with the President (Museveni) on two 
occasions and never mentioned it. I never sought any special treatment (for 
Diane). 
</P>
<P>
"In this climate of ethical hysteria, if you sleep with your wife, it's 
regarded as a conflict of interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally said the letter mistakenly was sent on a letterhead of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, which he formerly chaired. But he said the caucus 
also tried to persuade African nations to hire black lawyers and lobbyists, 
adding: 
</P>
<P>
"We had the entire caucus meet with Les Aspin," chairman of the House Armed 
Services Committee, "to help a black vendor in my district."

Youths wielding firearms, Molotov cocktails and other weapons went on the 
rampage in the Soviet Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, causing some deaths 
in the latest outbreak of violence in the nation's outlying republics, Tass 
news agency reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the youths tried to seize public transport vehicles, a police station 
and other key points last weekend in the city of Novy Uzen, east of the Caspian 
Sea. It suggested that the violence was still going on. 
</P>
<P>
The agency did not say what caused the flare-up Friday night, but earlier 
reports of trouble in the area said young people were angry about better 
working conditions enjoyed by employees temporarily in the area, probably 
ethnic Russians. 
</P>
<P>
"There were attempts to seize the city police station and the water supply 
system," Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been instances of arms being used, as well as Molotov cocktails. 
There have been deaths." 
</P>
<P>
Tass said that rioters, also armed with sticks, iron bars and rocks, "are 
attacking homes, stores and administrative buildings and beating up passers-by 
in residential areas and on city streets." The wording suggested that the 
unrest was still out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Public transport had been halted and many shops and industries were closed 
down. 
</P>
<P>
The rioting was the fifth outbreak of violence in the last year in the Soviet 
Union's volatile southern republics. 
</P>
<P>
It followed 10 days of violence in neighboring Uzbekistan this month in which 
at least 97 people died. Witnesses said Uzbeks hunted down minority Meskhetian 
Turks, burning homes, raping women and mutilating corpses. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the trouble in Novy Uzen, an oil and gas producing city of about 
120,000, had initially been controlled but flared up again. 
</P>
<P>
The Young Communist League daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said that young people, 
in talks with local authorities, had complained about "unequal pay between 
temporary workers and residents and the difficult social conditions in the 
(Mangishlak) peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the violence in Uzbekistan, more than 90 people have died in clashes in 
Armenia and Azerbaijan since early 1988 over the disputed territory of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
In Soviet Georgia, 21 people died when troops used gas and shovels to end 
several days of nationalist demonstrations in the capital, Tbilisi. 
Disturbances have also been reported in the Central Asian republic of 
Turkmenia. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1986, at least two people died in the Kazakh capital, Alma Ata, in 
clashes that erupted after the appointment of an ethnic Russian to replace the 
republic's longtime Communist Party chief. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov last week said unemployment has played a role in the 
Uzbekistan violence, saying one in five adults in the riot-torn Fergana Valley 
had no job. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, authorities pledged to create jobs, clean up pollution and grow more 
food in that region to stem the economic and environmental problems behind the 
unrest.

More than two years after a judge ruled that Mississippi's method of electing 
judges violated the federal Voting Rights Act, eight black judicial candidates 
are on the ballot in elections today. Also on the ballot are three proposed 
constitutional amendments. One would eliminate the long unenforced poll tax 
law. In April, 1987, U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. of Jackson, 
Miss., ruled that the state's judicial districts discriminated against blacks 
and ordered some districts redrawn. The ruling was upheld by the U.S. 5th 
Circuit Court of Appeals.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EMPLOYERS UNITE TO PUSH RIDE-SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to relieve downtown Glendale traffic congestion and improve air 
quality, 15 major employers have moved to seek state money for a computerized 
ride-sharing program. 
</P>
<P>
The businesses formed a corporation called the Glendale Traffic Management 
Assn., which represents the first coordinated effort by private businesses in 
conjunction with the city to reduce street congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The group is attempting to meet a June 30 deadline to apply for a $60,000 grant 
in matching funds from the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Chamber of Commerce has been working with businesses and the city 
since January to form the association to help employers meet state-mandated 
rules imposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to reduce the 
number of automobiles that employees drive to work.

YOU CAN'T TELL THE NEW PHILLIES WITH A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Len Dykstra, Roger McDowell, Dennis Cook, Terry Mulholland, John Kruk and Randy 
Ready are all on the Philadelphia Phillies' roster, but you wouldn't know it 
without a new scorecard. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Lee Thomas wasn't kidding when he promised to shake up the 
foundering franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who joined the Phillies last June 21, listened and watched as his club 
sank to the worst record in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He saw his pitchers give up too many walks, wild pitches and gopher balls. He 
cringed at the mental mistakes -- throws to the wrong base, stupid base-running 
and runner after runner left on base. 
</P>
<P>
On May 29, 39-year-old slugger Mike Schmidt set the overhaul of the Phillies in 
motion when he retired in San Diego, saying his skills had deserted him. 
</P>
<P>
Then Thomas acted. 
</P>
<P>
On June 2, Thomas sent outfielder-third baseman Chris James to the San Diego 
Padres for outfielder-first baseman Kruk and infielder Ready. 
</P>
<P>
It was just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Thomas sent ace reliever Steve Bedrosian to the San Francisco Giants 
for Cook and Mulholland, a pair of 26-year-old left-handed pitchers. He also 
got minor-league infielder Charley Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
About half an hour after the Giants' deal, Thomas struck again. 
</P>
<P>
This time he sent outfielder Juan Samuel to the New York Mets for center 
fielder Dykstra and reliever McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies may still finish with the worst record in baseball, but Thomas has 
made sure it won't be with the same old cast. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Nick Leyva wasted no time deploying his new players, tabbing Cook and 
Mulholland for the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland is listed to start in Tuesday's twi-night doubleheader against St. 
Louis and Cook probably will start Thursday. Dykstra, who platooned with the 
Mets, takes over center field on an everyday basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Cook and Mulholland can pitch here," Thomas said. "They may take some 
lumps. But they both have outstanding arms." 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive Dykstra gives the Phillies the leadoff-type hitter they have 
sought. He has a reputation for making things happen, and Leyva said he likes 
the look of Dykstra, Tom Herr and Von Hayes in the first three spots of the 
batting order. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, McDowell replacing Bedrosian as the bullpen closer appears to 
be a lateral move. But the main reason the Phillies could afford to let 
Bedrosian go is they rarely had late-inning leads to protect. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian, who won the NL Cy Young Award two years ago, is 2-3 with six saves 
in only 23 appearances this season. He had only nine save opportunities and a 
3.21 ERA. McDowell is 1-5 with four saves and a 3.31 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
All players involved appeared to understand the moves. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian and Samuel leave a no-win situation for teams with excellent chances 
of winning their divisions. Cook, Mulholland, Dykstra and McDowell are going to 
have to learn how to live, at least initially, in the world of the losers. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're (the Phillies) trying to make some headway and make things 
happen. You can't blame them for that," Bedrosian said. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel, a two-time NL All-Star second baseman, had been switched to center 
field this year to make way for Herr. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready for it," Samuel said. "Sure, you want to stay where you started. 
But it's part of the business." 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland was happy to change teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great for me," he said. "While I felt I was not wasted with the 
Giants, I would have liked to do more for the team. There were a lot of older 
players ahead of me. And the Phillies are looking to the future." 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who beat Cincinnati on Saturday, said "as long as I get to pitch that's 
all that matters. The Giants had too many good left-handers all logjammed 
together. Have the Phillies bettered themselves? We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra tried to be philosophical about going from a contender to a loser. 
</P>
<P>
"Every team has highs and lows. Obviously this team can't get any lower," he 
said. "I think I've come at a good time, because there is no way to go but up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be getting a chance to contribute every day and that's all I've wanted. I 
don't know what it's like to lose. And it's not something I want to learn." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell admitted he has struggled this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe a lot of it comes comes from not being given the opportunity 
to pitch with the Mets like I've had in the past few years," he said. "I 
haven't been pitching in many key situations and that is difficult to adjust 
to."

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE DECIDES TO CHANGE NAME

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saddleback Regional Chamber of Commerce is changing its name to the South 
Orange County Chamber of Commerce, effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The new name reflects a natural progression of the chamber's growth, which 
serves several communities in the southern part of the county, according to the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The change is not intended to interfere with other local chambers, said 
executive director Pat Crockett. Instead, the South Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce will try to help the smaller chambers by expanding its existing 
services and adding new ones, which will be announced in July, officials said.

An 18-year-old Fullerton man was killed and his passenger injured when their 
vehicle overturned, ejecting both men, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Mark Steven Villegas, suffered head injuries in the one-car 
accident, which occurred shortly after midnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Villegas, who drove a 1969 Datsun 510, was westbound on Chapman Road near 
Melody Lane when he apparently struck a curb and lost control, Placentia Police 
Sgt. Jay Fricke said. 
</P>
<P>
The car rolled over, ejecting Villegas and his passenger, whose name was not 
available Monday. Police are trying to determine whether Villegas was driving 
at an unsafe speed, Fricke said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither man wore a seat belt, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Villegas was pronounced dead hours later at UCI Medical Center in Orange. His 
passenger was transported to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, Fricke said.

COUNTY POLICY IN LAND SWAPS QUESTIONED BY GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury Monday questioned a real estate policy in which a 
landowner seeking to swap property with the county is sometimes allowed to 
choose the appraiser who establishes the value of both parcels. 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, the landowner must choose the appraiser from a list provided 
by the county and must pay the appraiser's fee. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Love, deputy director of the county General Services Agency, said the 
policy only applies to cases in which a single landowner is interested in the 
county property which cannot be sold on the open market. Love said those cases 
represent fewer than 5% of the county's property transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury report said, however, that "this selection and payment process 
can lead to a loss of impartiality on the part of the appraiser." The report 
also said that property officials in San Diego and Riverside counties do not 
allow an outside party to choose the appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ensure Objectivity' 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury's administration committee recommended that the county look into 
the practices of other counties "and develop a real estate appraisal procedure 
that ensures adequate appraiser independence and objectivity." 
</P>
<P>
Bill B. Wills, chairman of the committee, also mitigated the findings, however, 
by saying he did not believe that the practice was as serious as he first 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me the county has been well served by the process," Wills said. 
"We're recommending that they check other counties to see how they handle it, 
but I personally think they will find this is a good policy that they have." 
</P>
<P>
Wills said there is an advantage because it deters people who aren't serious 
about a transaction by requiring them to pay the appraisal fee. And, he said, 
it can prevent disagreements over the appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wills said, there is "an appearance of a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Procedure Defended 
</P>
<P>
Love said he will respond to the grand jury's recommendation, which is only 
advisory, and check with other counties about their policies. He also defended 
the county's current procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"We're only giving them a list of appraisers that we have confidence in," he 
said. "The list is developed based on our staff experiences." 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage is also that the developer is paying the fee rather than the 
taxpayer," Love said. And, he said, it avoids disagreements that require the 
parties to seek a second appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not quite sure what the conflict is," he said.

ORGANIZERS OK RELOCATION OF GAY FESTIVAL TO CITY'S PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Organizers of Orange County's first gay-pride festival, once planned for a 
regional park in Santa Ana, said Monday that the event instead will be held in 
the city's Civic Center Plaza, averting a possible clash between fundamentalist 
Christians and gays. 
</P>
<P>
However, a parade planned as part of the two-day event on Sept. 9 and 10 raised 
new concerns for conservative Christians, who threatened to protest if the 
route was outside the confines of the downtown Civic Center. The exact route 
for the parade was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that Civic Center Plaza will afford us the facilities necessary to 
produce the type of event which we have been developing," Janet Avery, 
president of Orange County Cultural Pride, said Monday of the compromise to 
relocate the planned festival. Avery's organization is staging the festival and 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
Avery said the organization did not "bow to the pressures" of conservative 
religious leaders by moving the event. "We have not been put out of public 
view," she said. "We find this an acceptable compromise. We are in downtown 
Santa Ana and at the legal and government hub of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The gay-pride event will include a film festival, historic displays, live 
entertainment, food and merchandise booths and a dance pavilion. The parade, 
expected to feature floats, marching units, motorcycles and cars, is schedule 
to start at noon, Sunday, Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Avery said Santa Ana City Manager David N. Ream contacted the Rev. Louis P. 
Sheldon, head of the Anaheim-based California Coalition for Traditional Values, 
about the civic center location for the festival. She said that Sheldon, who 
headed up the opposition to the event earlier slated for Centennial Park, has 
"indicated that, based on the compromise, he will cease organized political 
pressure against the city regarding the event." 
</P>
<P>
But Sheldon, contacted late Monday by The Times, said he was unaware a parade 
had been planned as part of the gay-pride festival and said he would be 
"vehemently opposed" to the parade if it were to be held outside the confines 
of the Civic Center Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell you this, if they parade on the public streets around the 
plaza, there will be thousands of people there protesting," Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon said Monday that the Civic Center is an appropriate place for the 
festival because it was out of residential areas where children might be able 
to view the activities. But he added that he has never agreed to a parade in 
the streets outside the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Avery said they will have fully trained security monitors plus Santa 
Ana Police Department officers patrolling the festival and the parade route. 
But she added that she never expected any "riots" or trouble at the event. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Orange County Culture Pride received approval from the 
city's recreation department to hold the event, which organizers have said is 
the county's first gay-pride festival. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was followed by complaints from conservative Christian leaders 
and neighborhood residents, who said gays and lesbians should not be allowed to 
hold the event in the public park, a place they contended was designed for more 
traditional family activities. 
</P>
<P>
Letters and telephone calls from residents opposing the event at the park in 
May prompted Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young to question whether the city 
should allow the festival to be held. Young had expressed concern that there 
would not be sufficient police and firefighters to control a confrontation 
between event participants and potential protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real unhappy about the parks that are there for quiet time and recreation 
becoming a focal point for controversial issues," Young told The Times last 
month. "From the publicity I'm seeing, there might be hundreds and hundreds of 
people protesting on both sides. If that kind of activity is taking place, it 
shouldn't be taking place in a community park." 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference called Monday by Avery, two other groups -- Christopher 
Street West/Los Angeles, organizers of the annual Los Angeles gay-pride 
celebration, and Long Beach Lesbian and Gay Pride Inc., who stage the annual 
gay-pride event in Long Beach -- presented the Orange County group with two 
checks totaling $15,000 for license fees and deposits that the city requires to 
hold such an event.

DRIVER CITED AFTER CRASH THAT HURT 7

The driver of a pickup truck that flipped over on Interstate 5 near San Juan 
Capistrano Sunday, injuring seven people, including three children, has been 
cited for turning too sharply onto the shoulder of the freeway, authorities 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lauro Montoya, 27, of Los Angeles was cited in the accident, which occurred 
shortly after a tire on the truck blew out, according California Highway Patrol 
Officer Carl Twigg. 
</P>
<P>
Twigg said Montoya apparently panicked and swerved onto the left shoulder, 
causing the truck to overturn and crack open the camper shell in which five 
women and three children were riding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Critical Condition 
</P>
<P>
One of those passengers, 29-year-old Manuela Perea, was reported in critical 
condition Monday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
Elizabeth Perea, 3, was reported in satisfactory condition at the same hospital 
with a fractured pelvis and right leg. Melissa Bailon, 10 months, suffered a 
skull fracture but was listed in satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya and four passengers were treated and released at San Clemente Hospital. 
One passenger, Janet Perea, 1, was in stable condition, according to a hospital 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The group, all residents of Los Angeles, was headed to Tijuana for a shopping 
trip, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
According to CHP spokesman Sam Haynes in Sacramento, state laws require minors 
under 12 to be accompanied by an adult when riding in the rear of a truck, but 
there are no safety restrictions on adults. If camper shells are permanently 
attached, no adult supervision or safety restraints for rear passengers are 
required under the law, Haynes added.

The state Senate on Monday approved a bill that would let Orange County 
residents vote on a proposal to raise their sales taxes to pay for new jail and 
courthouse facilities. 
</P>
<P>
By a 26-6 vote, the Senate approved the bill by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach) that would allow the county, with approval from most of its voters, to 
impose a half-cent sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would be used to pay off bonds issued to build and furnish juvenile and 
adult detention facilities and courthouse structures. Part of the tax money 
could also be used to operate the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The bill now goes before the Assembly.

McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Co. said a new version of its Series 6000 
minicomputers operates 70% faster because of improvements in the microchips 
used in the machines. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana-based unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp. said the improvements to 
the Series 6000 were made possible by the development of advanced computer 
chips designed by McDonnell Douglas engineers and LSI Logic Corp., a Milpitas, 
Calif., firm. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Bryga, director of marketing for the computer unit, said the Series 6000 
improvement represents "a sizable investment and is indicative of the company's 
commitment" to the series. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana unit had 1988 sales of more than $350 million.

O.C. PERFORMING ARTS CENTER BROADENS MUSIC MENU, BOOKS 2 FOUNDERS HALL CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
In a move designed both to beef up its musical menu and to make greater use of 
its facilities, the Orange County Performing Arts Center has booked two 
small-scale concerts, one jazz and one classical, in the 299-seat Founders Hall 
theater for the weekend of July 22-23. 
</P>
<P>
The Turtle Island String Quartet, a Bay Area group acclaimed for its 
genre-jumping blend of classical musicianship with improvisational jazz 
technique, plans two shows July 22, at 7:30 and 10 p.m. On July 23, pianist 
Armen Guzelimian and three members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic will give a 
recital at 4 p.m. of quartets by Brahms and Faure. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to use Founders Hall, which is chiefly a rehearsal room, is "a way 
to recognize artists we couldn't recognize in the larger hall," Center 
President Thomas R. Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The Turtle Island quartet represents the more significant departure from a 
Center tradition that has featured mostly well-known, low- or no-risk 
performers on its Big Band and contemporary jazz series in the 3,000-seat 
Segerstrom Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The quartet is a relatively new group that has had little exposure outside 
serious jazz circles. Its members are as likely to draw upon bluegrass, 
American and international folk music and rock -- elements that have been in 
short supply at the Center since it opened in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Center performance will not be a foreign experience for the group. 
"We've played all different kinds of venues," cellist Mark Summer said in a 
recent phone interview from his home in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played as part of a chamber music series at Stanford. We didn't know 
how that was going to go over because it was more of a classical audience. And 
we played on a chamber music series in Chicago. . . . People seem to be 
responding well, even when they haven't heard us before." 
</P>
<P>
Violinist David Balakrishnan (the group has a standard string-quartet lineup of 
two violins, viola and cello) was nominated for a Grammy Award last year for 
his arrangement of Duke Ellington's "Night in Tunisia." And Times jazz critic 
Leonard Feather named the ensemble "instrumental group of 1988." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of artist everybody here believes we want to feature as they 
develop and come into prominence," the Center's Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
However, on the few occasions that the Center ventured away from its regular 
diet of ballet, classical music, opera and musical theater bookings to offer 
pop and jazz shows, it has taken some criticism for the lack of adventuresome 
bookings. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea behind bringing in the Turtle Island quartet is another way of coming 
at that problem," Kendrick acknowledged. "It's not the same as trying to put 
Bernadette Peters or Peter Allen in (Segerstrom Hall). 
</P>
<P>
"The other concern we have is the smaller group, the one that is not known and 
cannot sell tickets for the larger hall. . . . (It) is maybe even more 
important to expose those groups that do not have the (widespread) visibility. 
We are very interested in that." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said these bookings represent an interim measure to broaden the 
Center's artistic scope while awaiting the planned construction of one or two 
more theaters of different sizes that would give the arts complex greater 
flexibility and range. "We would like to broaden the range for our core 
audience, and we would like to bring new people in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Center officials have frequently cited competition from the Pacific and Irvine 
Meadows amphitheaters for the kind of pop acts they would like to book into 
Segerstrom Hall, but Kendrick said he does not anticipate bidding wars with 
local concert clubs over acts envisioned for Founders Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can call what we would be doing competition," he said. "It's 
in such a limited, short form (for the Center), while it is their (the clubs') 
consistent fare. I don't think art centers create competition -- they generate 
more interest in the arts. The more opportunity there is, the more interest 
there is." 
</P>
<P>
But Ken Phebus, booking agent at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, the 
county's leading rock, pop and jazz concert club, said: "Anybody who's got a 
stage and seats is competition to me." 
</P>
<P>
"My job is to book this place ever day of the month with a potential sellout 
show," Phebus said. "If we end up bumping heads on a particular act, we intend 
to get it. That's true if it's the Celebrity Theatre (in Anaheim) or the 
Performing Arts Center or the Marquee (in Westminster) or Jezebel's (in 
Anaheim). If we want it, we're going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
But -- after repeating that the availability of Founders Hall is severely 
limited because of its primary function as a rehearsal hall -- Kendrick said: 
"If these shows are successful, we would try to maximize the use of that hall. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"If this doesn't work, that doesn't mean we will not try again. If this works 
in this area, I think, for instance, there are emerging country singers who are 
not suited to Segerstrom Hall that we could consider." 
</P>
<P>
The July 23 recital in Founders Hall will feature Guzelimian and violinist 
Mitchell Newman, violist Ralph Fielding and cellist Barry Gold. They will play 
Faure's quartet in C minor and Brahms' quartet in G minor.

O.C. THEATER AND FILM/JAN HERMAN: DIRECTOR AARON OPENS GROVE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the sweeping changes at the Grove Shakespeare Festival -- which has 
dropped its associated Grove Theatre Company designation, and has adopted a 
unified, indoor-outdoor schedule running through December instead of dual, 
year-round programming -- one of the things that remains unchanged is the 
theatrical collaboration with guest director Jules Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
When the festival launches its 11th annual Shakespeare season Friday with 
"Romeo and Juliet" under the stars at the 550-seat Festival Amphitheatre in 
Garden Grove, it will mark the third consecutive year that Aaron has directed 
the opening play. Last year, he staged "Richard II" and the year before "Julius 
Caesar." 
</P>
<P>
"I keep coming back for two reasons," Aaron said in an interview last week. 
"One, it lets me stay in touch with the greatest playwright in the language, of 
course. Two -- and I can't emphasize this enough -- the Grove is such a 
well-run company and cares so much about what it's doing that I find working 
here a pleasure, which I can't say often elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
A wiry artist of seemingly indefatigable energy who favors loud shirts and an 
earring in his left earlobe, the 46-year-old transplanted New Yorker is among 
the busiest stage directors in Southern California. For that matter, few 
directors anywhere in the country can claim to work as often as he does. Over 
the past 12 months, Aaron has staged 10 productions while also heading the 
graduate directing program at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
That torrid pace has taken him from South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa to the 
Public Theater in New York, from New Mexico Repertory in Santa Fe and 
Albuquerque to the Actors Theatre of Louisville, Ky., to name a few of the 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, when "Romeo and Juliet" is up and running, it will be Aaron's third 
production simultaneously on the boards in the greater Los Angeles area. He 
currently has "A Night at the Catskills," a musical revue at the Las Palmas 
Theatre, and "Hard Copy," an original musical comedy by Sam Harris at the Coast 
Playhouse, both in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Though Aaron has built a reputation for staging new and off-beat contemporary 
plays, having done more than 40 original works by such writers as John Guare, 
Elizabeth Diggs, Mayo Simon and Richard Strange, he tends to prefer his 
Shakespeare in period. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, I'll do what I would call 'concept Shakespeare,' where I'll 
update," he says. "One time at Calarts, I set 'Midsummer Night's Dream' in a 
San Francisco advertising agency for the first act and a Marin County ashram 
for the second. That added humor and a certain relevance to the play. But I 
normally avoid that sort of thing. After all, Shakespeare's plays speak for 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Still, bringing them to life on the stage requires "a theatrical equivalent" to 
"the emotional stakes of the play," he says. And so he always seeks an 
emblematic image to convey thematic content. Then, with his designer, he tries 
to work that image into the physical setting of the production. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the set for "Romeo and Juliet" consists of a huge sword plunged 
vertically into a sun-baked Italian street, dividing it in two, because the 
tragedy is about a pair of teen-age lovers in Verona forced to deal with "the 
remnants of a feud" between their families (the Capulets and the Montagues), 
and with their own fatal passion for each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a stark and vivid way of showing what's going on," said Aaron, 
adding that a bloody cloth spills over the stage, and the hilt of the sword 
also serves as a balcony above the street. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, "Richard II" had a turntable set to evoke the idea of a giant sun 
dial, so that Richard and Bolingbroke were seen as opponents caught up in the 
sweep of time and history. Richard's throne also became a coffin, suggesting 
that death and destruction are implicit in kingship. 
</P>
<P>
In "Julius Caesar," the physical embodiment of a theme about the corruption of 
overweaning power and the loss of values was more elaborate. The set included a 
series of dramatic columns and a large statue of Pompeii beneath which the 
famous oration scene unfolded. A huge map torn off the front of the stage at 
the opening of the play also framed the action. 
</P>
<P>
"The second act was virtually a deconstruction of the first," Aaron recalled. 
"The columns were broken down. The map was burnt and became a ground cloth. The 
statue was decapitated. Ultimately the ghost of the murdered Caesar appears on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The two comments on his Shakespeare productions that he most treasures, the 
director said, are "that they're clear and they keep your attention." 
</P>
<P>
But if Aaron aims for dramatic clarity, his methods have nonetheless been 
nurtured on the recondite scholarship of a trained intellectual. In fact, his 
career in the theater began far from the smell of the grease paint. 
</P>
<P>
With a doctorate from New York University in drama criticism and history -- his 
thesis was about "game ritual and the theater of the absurd" -- Aaron set out 
in the late '60s to become a literary gadfly. He began writing for such 
academic journals as Tulane Drama Review, Performance From Yale and Performing 
Arts Journal. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, he was living in a loft on New York's lower East 
Side, where he staged an environmental production of Jean Genet's "Deathwatch." 
His first effort, it gained him notice in the Village Voice as an experimental 
theater director. Soon, he was hanging out with Leonard Melfi and staging the 
work of that quintessentially downtown playwright of the absurd. 
</P>
<P>
Between his Off Off Broadway productions and his work at Yale Repertory, where 
he directed Chekov's "The Seagull," Aaron managed to squeeze in some 
co-directing for public television. "My life got so hectic I decided it might 
be good for me go back to academia," he recalled. That led him to Southern 
California, where he accepted an invitation from UC Riverside in 1974 to run 
its new graduate drama program. By 1981, he switched to the faculty at Calarts. 
In the meantime, he found himself directing again in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Aaron has worked in Orange County not only at the Grove (where 
he also directed "Vikings") but with even greater frequency at South Coast. He 
has done five Second Stage productions there ("She Also Dances," "Goodbye 
Freddie," "Life and Limb," "Cloud Nine" and "Marry Me a Little"), as well as 
three staged readings ("Elaine's Daughter," "American Beef" and "Bang Bang 
Blues"). 
</P>
<P>
"The way my life is nowadays I would make more money just directing," said 
Aaron, who lives in Silver Lake Hills. "But I enjoy teaching. And I think my 
work is much stronger because of it. You have to apply what you tell others to 
do. It keeps you fresh." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he is about to take a six-month "creative sabbatical" from Calarts to 
explore TV directing. That will leave him just enough time to put "Catskills" 
on tour to Las Vegas and Atlantic City after its Hollywood run ends in July and 
to work with Harris on "Hard Copy" rewrites in August. "We've got New York in 
mind," Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
And let's not forget Long Beach. He'll stage the opening play for the newly 
formed Long Beach Repertory's first four-play season, which will begin either 
in October or February. The date and the title are still being decided. 
</P>
<P>
Before then, he will take his first vacation in four years -- a two-week fling 
in Italy after "Romeo and Juliet" opens. "Believe it or not," he said, "the one 
thing I will avoid there completely is the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 "Romeo and Juliet" opens Friday at the Festival Amphitheatre, 12852 Main St., 
Garden Grove. A preview will be offered Thursday. All curtain times are 8:30. 
The show runs Thursdays to Sundays through July 15. Tickets: $16 to $23 ($10 
for the preview). Information: (714) 636-7213.

RECORD-BUSTING OPENING FOR 'GHOSTBUSTERS II' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer

<P>
Soaring temperatures must bring out a taste for slime, or at least ectoplasmic 
eradication, according to this weekend's box office figures. "Ghostbusters II" 
burst ahead of all other films in ticket sales and broke records for the 
biggest non-holiday weekend opening. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sequel played on 1,073 more screens than its supernatural 
predecessor, and ticket prices have increased by more than 22% since the 
slimebusting foursome made their debut in June, 1984. Roughly 2 million more 
people went to see "Ghostbusters II" than saw the opening weekend of the first 
"Ghostbusters," which went on to become the highest-grossing comedy of all time 
at $220 million. The latest installment garnered about $29.5 million in ticket 
sales on its first three days out, beating the original "Ghostbusters" which 
grossed $13 million, according to John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations 
Inc. which compiles box office figures. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghostbusters II" also set an all-time record for a one-day opening, netting 
about $10 million on Friday, according to industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of "Ghostbusters II" also provides the first hit under the 
aegis of Columbia Pictures' president Dawn Steel and will undoubtedly firm her 
position as studio chief. One of Steel's first moves after becoming president 
in October, 1987, was to reinstate the sequel, which had languished on the 
shelf during the brief administration of British producer David Puttnam. 
</P>
<P>
Puttnam, who had said he did not believe in high-priced sequels, tangled 
publicly with Creative Artists Agency over the film and had discussed making 
the movie with other, lesser-known actors to keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
The sequel, which, like its predecessor was directed by Ivan Reitman and stars 
Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver, 
premiered Friday and can be seen on 2,410 screens across the country. The first 
"Ghostbusters" premiered on significantly fewer -- 1,339 -- screens. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for "Ghostbusters II's" first three days narrowly beat out those for the 
opening wekend of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which made about $29.4 
million its first Friday through Sunday, breaking all records for a sequel. 
("Indiana Jones" opened on the four-day Memorial Day weekend and earned more 
than $46 million Friday through Monday.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty exciting," said Columbia Marketing President Buffy Shutt "I think 
we expected a big opening. But, it's always a wonderful surprise when you have 
the biggest three-day gross ever." 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales for No. 2 "Jones" dropped to $11.7 million, down 27% from last 
weekend. "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" dropped to $7.1 million, down 60% 
from its opening two weekends ago, and landed in the No. 4 spot. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "Dead Poets Society" -- a drama starring Robin Williams as 
an eccentric poetry instructor at an East Coast prep school -- gained by about 
20% and remained in third place. It was in third place last week when it was 
only playing in 687 theaters and kept its hold on that spot this week after the 
number of theaters showing it was upped to 1,091. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend the ghost-busting quartet will face more competition when Warners' 
much-hyped "Batman" swoops into theatres Friday. Also opening this weekend is 
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."

TV VETERAN TOM PATCHETT TRIES LIFE AS A PLAYWRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New playwright Tom Patchett has only one major fear about the debut of his play 
"Wolverines." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people to say: ' "ALF" Producer Writes Play,' " Patchett said. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the production of "Wolverines," which will enjoy a limited run of 
workshop performances at the Tiffany Theater Thursday through July 9, is a 
playwright's dream: The writer completes his first play and then -- instead of 
having to wait for financial backing from a producer -- takes a chunk of money 
out of the bank, hires the actors, rents the theater and puts on the show 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
But Patchett, 48, also worries that this improbable formula for his theatrical 
debut may destroy his chances for a fair critical reaction to the play. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most novice playwrights, Patchett has had a pretty good day job during 
recent years: He has worked as a writer and producer on such TV series as "The 
Carol Burnett Show," "The Bob Newhart Show," "The Tony Randall Show" and 
"Buffalo Bill," co-wrote the films "The Great Muppet Caper" and "The Muppets 
Take Manhattan" with then-partner Jay Tarses and, most recently, is the 
co-creator and co-executive producer of NBC's popular comedy series "ALF," 
about a furry, wise-cracking alien who lives in suburbia with a human family. 
</P>
<P>
Though his successful TV career has made his dream of presenting "Wolverines" 
possible, Patchett's nightmare is that his play might fall prey to unfair 
criticism because (a) he's footing the bill and (b) the theater world tends to 
frown on television writers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a danger of (critics likening the production to) 'Let's put on a play 
in your uncle's barn' -- I mean, I'm renting a theater and saying, 'Isn't this 
going to be great?' " Patchett said uneasily. The play is directed by Dennis 
Erdman, who directed the recent Tiffany Theater production "How the Other Half 
Loves," and is produced by Stephanie Hagen, an associate producer of "ALF." 
</P>
<P>
Patchett, who continues his television career as partner with Kenneth Kaufman 
in the 6-month-old Patchett-Kaufman Entertainment production company, winces 
when he reveals the price tag for 12 performances of "Wolverines," a tragicomic 
tale of festering family resentment set in the snowy woods of Patchett's native 
Michigan. "I think production is going to cost in the neighborhood of 
$40-$45,000," he hedged during a conversation at the new company's Culver City 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it's going to cost $80,000, " he admitted a few seconds later. "It 
just sounds like so much, I couldn't say it -- I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Patchett, who majored in theater at college in Michigan, also worries that his 
TV credentials may poison critics against the play. "If I'm going to make it as 
a playwright, I've got a lot to overcome, including my career in television," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's in my imagination, but I've seen reviews written (of TV writers' 
plays) where it's just excessive, the criticism. And it has nothing to do with 
television -- either the play works or it doesn't. Either it's sitcom-y, or it 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to worry about it, but I don't want to mislead people. I don't 
want people to . . . expect to see an episode of 'ALF' -- or something that is 
not realistic, that doesn't have any grit or shock or 'language' -- and say: 
'This isn't our kind of show, dear -- we'd better go.' I think (the play) is 
quite unlike what people would expect me to write about. That's what I like 
about it. I wanted to do something that was grittier than you're allowed to do 
on television, to see if I could." 
</P>
<P>
"I waited a long time to write a play at 48," Patchett mused. "If I had started 
this 20 years ago instead of trying to get a career going as a money-making 
writer, I might have written my 10 plays by now. But there is something called 
the golden handcuffs; you (make money) so you can do what you want to do later, 
and then you never do it." 
</P>
<P>
Though Patchett is proud of his play, he seems torn between wanting the outside 
world to see the play and warning that it is still a work-in-progress. He 
refuses to call the Tiffany production an "opening," prays that the critics 
won't show up, and hopes the play will eventually be workshopped at a venue 
such as the Manhattan Theatre Club or the Long Wharf Theatre before he calls it 
finished. "I'm looking for a stamp of legitimacy from the theater world," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You sort of lose an objectivity, in a way (by writing for television)," 
Patchett continued. "Even if you can think up funny things and put them in a 
situation that is palatable for television, you wonder if it's real. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Wolverines' is familiar territory to me. I know the atmosphere, I hear the 
voices, I've heard the cliches. . . . I really don't think I've told any sitcom 
lies in this and I'm sort of depending on the truth to carry it. If I'm going 
for a cheap joke here and there, I hope it sticks out like a sore thumb so I 
can get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
Patchett hopes that "Wolverines" will launch the playwriting career he wishes 
he'd begun at 25, but he also has no plans to give up on TV. Among 
Patchett-Kaufman's current projects are "Working Girl," a comedy for NBC based 
on the feature film, starring Nancy McKeon. The network has ordered 12 
episodes, although the show has not yet won a time slot on the schedule. 
Patchett also continues as "ALF" co-executive producer with Bernie Brillstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the excitement, I like the people, I like the deals, I like the laughs, 
the comedy -- it's wonderful," Patchett said of his decades in television. "I 
don't think I'll ever just go to the beach house and write plays. I'll always 
write them -- I'll just be able to dictate them to somebody else."

"Even though we've shortened the schedule to six months, it will be our most 
ambitious season," Grove artistic director Thomas F. Bradac says. 
</P>
<P>
And the most expensive. The projected budget comes to $850,000, Bradac says -- 
considerably more than last year's $570,000 and higher than the $660,000 
projected for the season in January. 
</P>
<P>
Bradac calls the budget "realistic," nonetheless. He expects the theater to 
cover the difference with more subscriptions, modestly higher ticket prices and 
higher attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to do about $100,000 more in ticket sales at the box office than last 
year," Bradac says, "which is an increase of about 25%." 
</P>
<P>
The Grove has 2,200 season ticket-holders. It is projecting 2,600 by the end of 
June and hopes to have 3,000 by the beginning of August, Bradac says. Partial 
to full subscriptions range from $30 to $175. 
</P>
<P>
The previously reported schedule has been finalized as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare -- July 15 to 22 (Amphitheatre) 
-- directed by Jules Aaron, starring David Anthony Smith as Romeo and Sue Doupe 
as Juliet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Songs of War" by Murray Shisgal -- July 5 to Aug. 5 (Gem, a world 
premiere) -- directed by Jerome Guardino, starring Steeve Arlen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Cyrano de Bergerac" by Edmund Rostand -- July 20 to Aug. 12 (Amphitheatre) 
-- directed by Bradac, starring Charles Lanyer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Heathen Valley" by Romulus Linney -- Aug. 16 to Sept. 16 (Gem) -- directed 
by Philip Killian, not cast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" by Shakespeare -- Aug. 24 to Sept. 16 
(Amphitheatre) -- directed by Victor Pappas, not cast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Scoundrel" by Gregory Mortensen, an adaptation with music, from "The 
Alchemist" by Ben Jonson -- Oct. 4 to Nov. 4 (Gem) -- directed by Bradac, not 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Twelfth Night" by Shakespeare -- Nov. 21 to Dec. 23 (Gem) -- directed by 
David Herman, not cast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "A Child's Christmas in Wales" by Jeremy Brooks and Adrian Mitchell, 
adapted from a Dylan Thomas reminiscence -- Dec. 8 to 10, 15 to 17, 22 to 24 
(Amphitheatre) -- directed by Daniel Bryan Cartmell, not cast. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Itzin, who had been expected to play Cyrano, landed a role in "Nutt 
House," a Mel Brooks sitcom for NBC with Cloris Leachman and Harvey Korman. 
</P>
<P>
"They start shooting around the end of July, just when 'Cyrano' will be going 
into tech rehearsals," Bradac says. "We're sorry to lose him, but we've got a 
fine replacement." 
</P>
<P>
Lanyer, who will play Cyrano, was seen as Prospero in "The Tempest" at the 
Grove in 1985 and in "Haut Gout" at South Coast Repertory in 1987. He also 
appeared in Elizabeth Swados' musical "Alice in Concert" starring Meryl Streep 
at the Public Theater in the early 1980s. (He sang "The Walrus and the 
Carpenter" with Amanda Plummer). 
</P>
<P>
Arlen, the lead in "The Songs of War," is perhaps best known for his 
co-starring role in "La Cage aux Folles" on Broadway. He will be joined in the 
Shisgal play by Juliet Landau, Connie Danese, Raymond Lynch, Hale Porter and 
Paul Keith. 
</P>
<P>
Killian ("Heathen Valley") recently staged the Los Angeles production of 
"Tamara" and "All My Sons" at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Pappas ("Two 
Gentlemen") won a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award this year for his 
production of "South Central Rain" at the Tamarind Theatre. And Herman ("12th 
Night") staged last season's Space Age "The Comedy of Errors" at the Grove.JAN

The widow of Sweden's assassinated Prime Minister Olof Palme identified 
defendant Christer Pettersson in court as the man she saw seconds after her 
husband was fatally shot and she was wounded more than three years ago. Lisbet 
Palme, grazed by one of the bullets that killed her husband on the night of 
Feb. 28, 1986, as they walked home from a movie in Stockholm, said Pettersson 
stared at her and her husband with hostility after the shooting and then fled. 
She did not see Pettersson carrying a gun, however, she said.

BILL WOULD EXPAND HEALTH CARE FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) introduced legislation that would expand Medicaid 
health-care coverage to thousands of low-income children and pregnant women at 
an estimated annual cost of $1 billion. Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee, is attempting to provide Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and to 
children under age 6 in families whose income is 185% of the poverty level -- 
$22,385 for a family of four. Under legislation enacted last year and being 
phased in during fiscal 1989 and 1990, Medicaid coverage is guaranteed to 
pregnant women and infants under age 1 in families whose income is at the 
poverty level -- $12,100 for a family of four. Bentsen's bill would expand 
coverage to an additional 300,000 pregnant women and to 1.6 million children 
under age 6 in fiscal years 1990 and 1991, his office said.

David (Moochie) Welch has been convicted in Oakland of the 1986 pre-dawn 
rampage that left his former girlfriend and five other people dead. An Alameda 
County jury found Welch guilty of breaking into the home of 17-year-old Dellane 
Mabrey, his former girlfriend and the mother of their young son, and shooting 
her to death with an Uzi assault rifle. Also killed in the Dec. 8 attack were 
Sean Orlando Mabrey, 21; Dwayne Miller, 4; Kathy Walker, 34; Darnell Mabrey, 
20, and Valencia Morgan, 3. Because the jury found that special circumstances 
were involved, Welch faces the death penalty or life in prison.

Iran's presidential election will be held July 28, three weeks earlier than 
planned, and the new president will begin his four-year term before the 
official October starting date, the Interior Ministry announced. It gave no 
reason, but the move appeared aimed at speeding the transition of power after 
the June 3 death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. It would consolidate 
control under his successor as spiritual leader, President Ali Khamenei, and 
Khamenei's likely successor as head of state, Parliament Speaker Hashemi 
Rafsanjani.

Federal judges and senior executive branch employees should get pay raises, 
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) declared. "It may well be that they'll 
recommend that we phase out honorariums over a period of years with perhaps an 
increase over a period of years starting in the next Congress for members of 
Congress," Foley said at a political fund-raiser in New York. Foley's comments 
are the first indication that Congress is willing to reopen the politically 
volatile issue. The House in February, mindful of a public outcry, killed a 51% 
hike for judges, executives and legislators.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said he has asked Cardinal Miguel Obando y 
Bravo to mediate between Nicaragua and the United States to open the way for 
dialogue between the bitterly opposed countries. Obando y Bravo has often been 
critical of the leftist Sandinistas. The cardinal said the church is ready to 
take any steps to help bring peace to Nicaragua, torn by eight years of war 
against U.S.-backed rebels. Meanwhile, Washington accused Managua of trying to 
prevent monitoring of its elections by requiring Americans to get visas before 
entering the country.

After an 11-year hiatus, pianist Van Cliburn resumed his public performances to 
thunderous applause with a Philadelphia concert dedicated to two late friends. 
Before performing his first selection, Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1, Cliburn 
told the audience of 12,000 that "this is a very sentimental evening for me." 
The pianist dedicated the concert at the Mann Music Center to conductor Eugene 
Ormandy and Fredric R. Mann, a former U.S. ambassador who headed the concert 
festival there from 1949 until his death in 1987.

OVER-30 BASEBALL LEAGUES PROVIDE 12,000 PLAYERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RELIVE 
THE PAST AND HAVE SOME FUN

Many of the baseball trophies and awards are in boxes somewhere now, replaced 
on the desktops by pictures of the children, or grandchildren. The scrapbook 
pages have yellowed a bit, and maybe some of the memories have, too. 
</P>
<P>
But please don't bother Frank Jelincich with that sort of thing. That's for old 
men, and Jelincich doesn't consider himself old. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every Sunday for the last three years, Jelincich has made his way to one 
baseball field or another, wearing his uniform proudly. And almost every Sunday 
his name has been on the starting lineup card as the designated hitter for the 
California All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
Jelincich is 72. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Mens Senior Baseball League (MSBL), a hardball organization that 
provides dreams for children over 30 who firmly believe that baseball diamonds 
are forever and softball diamonds are for never. 
</P>
<P>
Jelincich, who plays with men about half his age, is unusual in terms of age. 
But the MSBL doesn't really measure age as much as enthusiasm, which is why 
Jelincich epitomizes the essence of a league that has only two requirements: 
</P>
<P>
 -- You must be over 30. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You must be under 30, at heart. 
</P>
<P>
The MSBL is the brainchild of Steve Sigler, 39, of Jericho, N.Y., who created 
it in 1986 as an alternative to softball. Sigler had not played baseball in 
more than 20 years. "Just because a person is 30, 35, 40 or older doesn't mean 
he loves playing baseball any less," Sigler says. 
</P>
<P>
The MSBL has blossomed to more than 12,000 players. The first league, made up 
of four teams, was on Long Island. Today, Long Island has 46 teams. 
</P>
<P>
By July of 1988, the MSBL had grown to 150 teams in 20 leagues in 20 U.S. 
cities. Today, less than a year later, there are 825 teams in 80 leagues in 80 
cities, including some in Canada, the Dominican Republic and the Virgin 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people organizing teams in Japan and Holland, too," said Sigler, a 
financial officer for a stationery company. 
</P>
<P>
California, the state with the most MSBL participants, has 86 teams and nine 
leagues. The winner of these and other league titles will go to the second 
annual MSBL World Series in Phoenix to play six games in four days next fall. 
Last year, the Sioux Falls Mount Rushmores, a South Dakota all-star team, won 
the over-30 championship and, in the over-40 division, Woodland-Davis defeated 
Sacramento in an all-California final. 
</P>
<P>
"The popularity of this is unbelievable," said Val Lewis, president of the 
12-team Sacramento League. "The problem isn't getting enough teams, it's 
getting enough facilities. We've gotten so many calls that we have to slow down 
our promotions." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 47, a civil engineer who has a baseball team living in his home -- he 
has 11 children -- condemns softball and its acceptance as the sport for 
middle-aged men. So do his friends. MSBL's motto is, "Don't go soft; play 
hardball," and the players figure that if they didn't play softball when they 
were young, why should they play it now? 
</P>
<P>
"We're already looking toward developing a 50-and-over league because it's hard 
to imagine our future without baseball," Lewis said. "This is keeping a bunch 
of us young. Unless we're dead, I don't see any reason why we can't keep doing 
this past 60." 
</P>
<P>
Some players say that over-30 baseball provides an escape from everyday 
pressures, and Sigler calls it "very therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
Most players, however, are playing for a different reason. They are rounding 
the bases in pursuit of the past, attempting to rediscover their youth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're living out dreams and fantasies," said California Assemblyman Tom 
Hayden, 49, who plays for the Hollywood Stars. "This generation wants to bring 
baseball back. The baby boomer generation is holding onto its childhood." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gary Zive, 32, a construction manager in Orange County and president of 
the 12-team Los Angeles-Orange County League: 
</P>
<P>
"We're all kids again," Zive said. "There is a special feeling to putting on a 
uniform again. We have a new lease on our baseball lives, and I'm reliving a 
dream. There's a great element of fantasy here." 
</P>
<P>
Said John Frietas, 44, president of the Northern California Old-Timers' League: 
"This is resurrecting our youth. It enhances your whole being to know that you 
can still do it again. It's an incredible, wonderful feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The MSBL rosters are sprinkled with names of former major league players, 
although no ex-pro can play unless he has been out of baseball for at least 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a dream come true," said Ron Dunn, a former Chicago Cub who is 
president of the 20-team San Jose League. 
</P>
<P>
Other one-time pros include former Cub Jose Cardenal, playing in the 13-team 
Chicago League, and former Boston pitcher Bill Lee, playing in the four-team 
Vermont League. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Barr, once of the San Francisco Giants, and Lowell Palmer, formerly of the 
Philadelphia Phillies, play in the Sacramento League. Both Barr and Palmer are 
pitchers who prefer being on the hill to being over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in the majors, it was a combination of pressure and fun," Barr, 41, 
said. "The emphasis now is on fun. If I make an error, 4 million people won't 
read about it the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
The league with the most former pros is the eight-team Old Glories League in 
the Dominican Republic, which features Rico Carty, Juan Marichal, Cesar 
Geronimo and Frank Taveras. Although most of the games are between teams who 
have no former pros, they still draw an average of 5,000 fans a game. The 
Dominicans will send an all-star team to the World Series, in which they 
finished third last year. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, people thought it was just an old-timers' game and that we would 
drop balls and laugh," said Humberto Franco, the 48-year-old president of the 
league. "But this is serious baseball. We don't drop balls, and if we do, we 
certainly don't laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, former major leaguers Luis Tiant and Orlando Cepeda played for teams 
in Sacramento, but they have defected to a new over-35 league in Florida. That 
eight-team league will be made up exclusively of former pros and is scheduled 
to begin its 72-game schedule Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
That former pros would play in the MSBL speaks volumes about how competitive it 
is, especially because they are often not the best players. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a group of San Jose all-stars without former pros defeated the 
University of Santa Clara, 11-6, in an exhibition game. Santa Clara, a Division 
I team, later finished its college season with a 43-18-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out and some of their guys were overweight and our guys didn't take 
the game as seriously as if it were another college team," said Mike Cummins, 
Santa Clara assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"But those guys had some tools and they got our attention pretty quick."

SPORTS AGENTS ARE SENTENCED FOR SIGNINGS

A federal judge sentenced sports agents Norby Walters and Lloyd Bloom to prison 
Monday, saying he hopes their punishment helps bring "the rule of law" to 
big-time college sports. 
</P>
<P>
Walters and Bloom were convicted in April of signing athletes before the 
athletes' college eligibility had expired, and of threatening some of the 
athletes with harm if they sought to break the agreements. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George Marovich said that the involvement of the agents, 
particularly Walters, with an organized-crime figure weighed heavily in his 
decision to sentence Walters to five years in prison and Bloom to three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't dream of breaking the law. That's not who I am," an almost 
inaudible Walters told the judge before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom said: "I am deeply sorry for what I've done. If I can be given a second 
chance, I'd like it." 
</P>
<P>
Marovich said that although "there were no heroes" among the athletes and 
universities involved in the trial, Walters and Bloom still must pay. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered each to serve five years' probation after leaving prison. 
Bloom also was ordered to finish paying back $145,000 to Paul Palmer, a running 
back with the Kansas City Chiefs who had sought to invest the money with Bloom. 
Walters was ordered to forfeit $250,000 to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 57, and Bloom, 29, were convicted April 13 of racketeering, conspiracy 
and mail fraud after a five-week trial. Each had faced up to 55 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing, Walters and Bloom were released on bond for 30 days, 
pending appeals. Lawyers for both agents said they would appeal the convictions 
and sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The agents were accused of: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paying athletes thousands of dollars to sign secret representation 
contracts before their college eligibility had expired, a violation of National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Threatening some athletes with harm, including broken legs, to keep them 
from breaking the agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cheating major universities out of scholarship money through the NCAA 
violation, which made the athletes ineligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
Walters and Bloom were convicted of all counts except two of four mail-fraud 
charges, which concerned the defrauding of the universities. 
</P>
<P>
Marovich said the case was notable for "the absence of any easily identifiable 
good guys." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said: "I do want to give fair warning" to athletes, sports agents, 
university administrators and others involved in college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"You may be playing in a different ballgame and it might be called hardball. . 
. . There is a previously unrecognized player on the field -- the rule of law."

<P>
Attorney Dan Webb, representing Bloom, said after the sentencing that he was 
gratified that the judge apparently agreed that "these universities are a 
cesspool of corruption, that they have destroyed amateur athletics in America." 
</P>
<P>
Marovich said he was particularly concerned about the link between Walters and 
Michael Franzese, a jailed member of a New York organized-crime family who 
testified that he helped finance the sports-representation business started by 
Walters and Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
"The infiltration of organized crime in this activity was an integral part of 
determining the sentence," U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Walters represented entertainers for more than 30 years, and sought to 
represent athletes with Bloom only during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Walters said Monday that he had "lost every penny" of the nearly $1 million he 
invested in the sports business. "I didn't threaten anybody," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-three players who signed with Walters and Bloom avoided prosecution by 
agreeing to cooperate with the government, to perform community service and to 
reimburse their schools for part of their scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Cris Carter of the Philadelphia Eagles pleaded guilty in 
September to mail fraud and obstruction of justice. He said he took $5,000 from 
Walters and Bloom in 1986 while a junior at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
In April he was fined $15,000 and ordered to perform 600 hours of community 
service.

BLUE JAYS BATTER ANGEL PITCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angel pitching staff has been taking a beating lately. Until Monday night, 
it wasn't a matter of bruised earned-run averages, though. They were winning, 
yet still experiencing the agony of the feet, shins and ankles. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Chuck Finley became the third Angel pitcher in four days to be hit with 
a batted ball, but the Blue Jays did more damage to Angel pitches than pitchers 
in an 8-1 victory in front of 24,430 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto scored four runs off Finley, whose departure was hastened in the sixth 
by a sharp grounder off the bat of Tony Fernandez that struck him on the inside 
of the right ankle. Fernandez, the first batter of the inning, subsequently 
scored to break a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Before Finley hobbled off, however, Kelly Gruber and George Bell also had 
crossed the plate and then the Blue Jays began to batter the Angel bullpen. 
Toronto finished the game with 15 hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck's ankle is fine. We took him out because he lost his composure," Manager 
Doug Rader said. "He's going through a tough time, but it appeared he was 
trying to win two games in one outing." 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who joins Bryan Harvey and Greg Minton on the Angel hit list, was 
examined by team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum. The injury was diagnosed as a 
contusion, and Finley should be able to make his next start. Harvey took a shot 
on his right foot Friday, and Minton was struck in the right shin Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rader also exited early, after being ejected by home plate umpire Al Clark. 
With two on in the eighth, Clark called Devon White out on strikes and quickly 
waved the Angel center fielder toward the dugout when he began to protest. 
Rader rushed from the dugout to argue, and quickly earned his first ejection of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"A player has a right to voice his objection and it's up to the umpire to take 
it for a while and then get on with the game," Rader said. "What's Devo 
supposed to do? Go right back to the dugout with his tail between his legs?" 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty much how the Angels went in the eighth. Failing to take a cue 
from his riled manager, Wally Joyner meekly grounded into a double play to end 
the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Finley (7-6) is 0-4 this month, but his performance hardly qualifies as a 
classic June swoon. White's fourth-inning solo homer was the only run the 
Angels have scored in the last 29 1/3 innings with Finley pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who had pitched into the seventh inning or later in 11 of his first 13 
starts, didn't last that long Monday. But who knows how things would have 
turned out had he been able to avoid Fernandez's grounder. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck is going through a very frustrating time," Rader said. "It would help if 
we got him a few runs, that's for sure, but it's part of the education 
process." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays scored in the third inning, but they did not look powerful. Kevin 
Batiste led off with a bunt. Finley fielded the ball cleanly but then whirled 
and fired wildly to first. Batiste advanced to second. Nelson Liriano 
sacrificed and Junior Felix lined out to center to score Batiste and give the 
Blue Jays a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto starter Dave Stieb (7-3) did not allow a hit in the first three 
innings, but the Angels had their first hit -- and first run -- in the fourth 
when White hit his first pitch over the right-center field fence to tie the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
But the Blue Jays knocked Finley out in the sixth. Fernandez hit the shot off 
Finley's ankle and then White appeared to misjudge Gruber's line drive to 
left-center. White took a bad angle in his attempt to cut off the ball and it 
skipped past him and bounded to the wall. Fernandez scored and Gruber jogged to 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Bell followed with a double down the left-field line to score Gruber and one 
out later, Manny Lee singled to center to score Bell. That was it for Finley, 
who gave way to Dan Petry. 
</P>
<P>
Petry gave up three consecutive hits -- including Felix's two-run homer into 
the second deck in right-center -- without getting an out in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
And by the time Willie Fraser was summoned, the Blue Jays led, 6-1, and were on 
their way to their first victory in seven games against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser didn't exactly restore order. Fernandez took second on a passed ball and 
scored on Bell's single off the glove of shortstop Dick Schofield. Pat Borders 
singled to right, and Lee hit a ground-rule double that scored Bell to make it 
8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto, which sent 10 batters to the plate, left the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone knew we hadn't beaten them this year," Toronto Manager Cito 
Gaston said. "We didn't talk about it, but we all knew it. This time, we got 
good pitching, good hitting and good defense." 
</P>
<P>
It was good enough for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tony Armas, who has been on the disabled list since May 16 with a strained left 
hamstring, was reinstated Monday and outfielder Dante Bichette was optioned to 
triple-A affiliate Edmonton. Bichette, whose surprising numbers this spring 
(.388 with four homers and 14 RBIs) convinced Manager Doug Rader to include him 
on the 24-man, opening-day roster, had only one hit in his last 16 at-bats and 
his average had slipped to .195. Bichette said he had been anticipating the 
move for "two or three weeks," but that didn't seem to lessen the blow. "I 
guess it's for the best," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rader said that a number of factors -- not the least of which is Claudell 
Washington's success against left-handed pitching -- have diminished Bichette's 
playing time. "We originally thought that if we could get Dante 200 to 250 
at-bats, being up here would be a bigger plus than having him play every day in 
triple-A," Rader said. "But I don't see how in the world we can get him that 
many in this situation. He's way out of sync at the plate and the only thing 
you can forecast is more of the same. And that's counter productive. Now, if we 
have to press him into service because of an injury, he'll be better prepared." 
. . . Armas said he feels good but doesn't want to play first base anymore 
because "I stretch or pull a muscle on every play." He needn't worry. "Tony's 
reflexes aren't suited to first base," Rader said. "We're going to keep him out 
in the patch (outfield) from now on."

A PLACE TO SKATE; 
</P>
<P>
COUSINS HELPS DEVELOP FOUNDATION TO EASE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF COMPETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN LE BATARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robin Cousins, winner of more than 20 international figure skating 
competitions, among them the 1980 Olympic gold medal in Lake Placid, vividly 
remembers his struggling days, before trophies and glory, when success actually 
ranked above survival on his priority list. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Cousins chose between his family and skating, his family finishing a 
close second. He moved from his home in Birmingham, England, to London, alone 
at 17, and lived there for two years, sharing his $14-a-week apartment with a 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
"I was living in what amounted to a converted closet," he says today. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers having a bedroom, a bathroom and a Bunsen burner, which, 
considering the barren surroundings, almost qualified as furniture. He 
remembers walking to a nearby skating rink every day at 5 a.m. and working in a 
department store afterward so that he could finance his skating. He remembers 
that, despite his efforts, he was getting the same amount of training in one 
week that most of his competitors were getting in a day. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Robin Cousins remembers, which is why he has helped develop the Foundation 
for International Ice Skating Advancement in the hope that future champions 
won't have a past they might prefer to forget. 
</P>
<P>
With Cousins as the vice president and program developer, the foundation offers 
opportunities to talented youngsters who might not otherwise be able to afford 
top-level training. In the skating world, the better you become, the more it 
costs; but the foundation offers an alternative for those who have a wealth of 
promise, if not money. 
</P>
<P>
"This is being run by the heart, not the pocketbook," said Cousins, who has 
been working with the foundation in Blue Jay, near Lake Arrowhead, for the last 
three years, although he still performs from time to time in skating shows. 
</P>
<P>
Supported by corporate-sponsored scholarships worth $35,000 a year, the 
foundation gives athletes a place to live year-round. Tucked among the pine 
trees is a multimillion-dollar facility -- 10 acres and expanding -- complete 
with dormitories, ice rinks, weight rooms and a 360-degree jump harness, which 
allows skaters to practice difficult jumps without fear of falling. 
</P>
<P>
"In this country, if you can't afford skating, you won't be skating very long," 
said Doug Mattis, who is on scholarship along with 17 others. "I can honestly 
say that I wouldn't be skating right now if it weren't for the foundation." 
</P>
<P>
Mattis, 23, of Philadelphia, is ranked ninth in the United States and shooting 
to become one of the top three American males to make the world championship 
and Olympic teams. Like the others, his diet is carefully monitored by the 
foundation's 40 professional instructors, and he is required to adhere to a 
strict off-ice program that includes ballet, dancing and weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
He and the others don't have much time for anything outside of skating. Mattis 
is up at 5 a.m. for breakfast and on the ice until 7:45. He works in the Lake 
Arrowhead Hotel's accounting department until 11:45. At noon, he's on the ice 
again until a little after 4, and then he works again at the hotel until after 
6. He must then begin some off-ice training, and he's lucky if he's in bed by 
11. 
</P>
<P>
And Mattis, believe it or not, has it easy. He doesn't have to worry about 
studying. Not so with Cameron McCoy, a 15-year-old from Lancaster, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy is enrolled in the Antelope Valley Independent Study Program. She goes to 
school once a week for an hour to be tested and pick up a week's worth of 
homework. Last February, on the night before the U.S. Championships in 
Baltimore, McCoy locked herself in her hotel room and began preparing for what 
she called the biggest competition in her life by doing a week's worth of 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little behind," said McCoy, an A student who hasn't been in a normal 
classroom setting since seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gilbert Holmes, president of the foundation, there is a request 
before the school district for an arrangement that would allow athletes to go 
to school within the facility. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy sees her parents only on weekends but has been living away from home 
since she was 12. Before then, her mother would get up at 3 every morning to 
take her to the closest available rink, two hours away. The younger McCoy, 
sounding more like an adult than an 11th-grader, says moving away from home was 
just one of the many sacrifices she has made in pursuit of glory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not missing out on my childhood," she said. "This is preparing me for 
adulthood, showing me self-determination. Sometimes I do feel like I'm missing 
out, but then I go out and skate, and it feels wonderful. The thought just 
disappears." 
</P>
<P>
The motivation, of course, is becoming a champion. The foundation doesn't put a 
price tag on that opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main goal is not to make champions," Holmes said. "But our country will 
certainly have more champions with foundations like this."

SCOTT OSTLER: CHEAP AS THE SHOTS MIGHT BE, AT LEAST THE PRICE IS RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Deep thoughts, cheap shots and bon mots . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At the official retirement ceremony of Oklahoma football Coach Barry Switzer, 
will his former players honor him with a 21-handgun salute? 
</P>
<P>
You knew that when Switzer announced his retirement, there would be those who 
would portray him as a courageous martyr to the flawed and antiquated National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. system. If you knew that, you probably also knew that 
the first person to portray Switzer that way would be Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
He says he was frustrated by NCAA rules that do not "recognize the financial 
needs of young athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the behavior of many of Switzer's players, the NCAA rules also do 
not recognize the sexual, automotive, pharmaceutical or ballistic needs of 
young athletes. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing his retirement, Switzer said, "I finally decided the time has 
come for new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
I agree with that statement, except that Barry should have left out the new. 
</P>
<P>
Attention Dodger management: 
</P>
<P>
You have a wonderful stadium, clean and pretty. You have a scoreboard that is a 
delightful dinosaur in that it always displays the game's linescore, never 
gives way to commercials, as does the annoying scoreboard in a nearby stadium 
that I won't name because I wouldn't want to embarrass the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
You also have a nice video screen-message board, on which you show us amusing 
baseball blooper footage of players diving into grandstands and impaling 
themselves on umbrella tips. 
</P>
<P>
You even took my advice years ago and installed TV monitors over the concession 
stands, to make more bearable those three-inning waits for nachos. 
</P>
<P>
All you need to complete the package is a large board displaying 
up-to-the-minute scores of other games. I know, you flash the scores on the 
message board, but I'm always looking away and wind up having to ask five 
people before I find one who saw the Giant-Astro score. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodgers in a title race, and many fans interested in the big baseball 
picture, you really need an other-games scoreboard. For a state-of-the-art 
example, you might want to check out Wrigley Field in Chicago, which installed 
such a board about six decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Also, on the video screen, between innings, how about showing us videotape 
highlights of other games being played that very night? Thank you, thank you so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
On the Detroit civic traitor scale, the only person higher up than a guy who 
drives a foreign car would be a beloved local sports superstar who has an 
endorsement deal with Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
I'm speaking, of course, of Isiah Thomas. He signed with Toyota last year to 
appear in their ads, explaining that he tried to sign with an American auto 
company but was rejected. Many other Detroit sports figures do auto ads, 
including Sparky Anderson and Chuck Daly, but for American cars. 
</P>
<P>
One Detroiter expressed his disapproval with Isiah last year by dumping 20,000 
Ford truck tires on Zeke's front lawn. The tires clashed with the landscaping, 
so Thomas had them removed. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the Pistons had won their recent championship, Toyota ran a 
full-page ad in each Detroit newspaper, featuring an enormous photo of Isiah -- 
a congratulatory tribute from one king of the compacts to another. 
</P>
<P>
A famous name in Laker history was in the news recently. It didn't rate big 
headlines, except maybe in Milwaukee, but the Bucks elected not to renew the 
contract of veteran guard Sidney Moncrief. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney had a very nice 10-season career in Milwaukee, showing great leadership 
and averaging as many as 22.5 points. But he is 31 years old and has been 
plagued with injuries in recent seasons, so he will slip away, either to 
another club or into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Moncrief has a special place in Laker lore. It is all but forgotten that the 
Lakers, up first in the 1979 draft, weren't sure who to pick. Should they go 
with Moncrief, a great-attitude young man from Arkansas, a truly beautiful and 
high-flying off-guard type who would perfectly complement the Lakers' young 
point guard, Norm Nixon? 
</P>
<P>
Or should the Lakers go for a teen-age kid who had played only two seasons of 
college ball, who had questionable National Basketball Assn. speed, jumping and 
shooting ability, and whose ballhandling skills might well clash with those of 
Nixon? 
</P>
<P>
At least one high-ranking Laker executive held out for Moncrief. But Jack Kent 
Cooke, in his last official duty as Laker owner, ordered his staff to draft 
Earvin (Magic) Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
It's really not a bit funny that some NBA writers covering the finals were 
referring to the leg-injury-stricken Lakers' quick exit as "swoon over my 
hammy."

NEWSWIRE: KEATING SIGNS WITH TIGERS, WILL SKIP FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Keating, the No. 3 receiver last fall for UCLA's football team, signed a 
professional baseball contract with the Detroit Tigers and will skip his senior 
football season. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've decided to make baseball my career, I figured it was time to 
concentrate solely on that and give that 100% of my effort," Keating said 
Monday. He caught 23 passes for 341 yards and five touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, 21, batted .266 in 52 games this spring for the UCLA baseball team, 
with six home runs and 24 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Considered to be an exceptional center fielder, he was a fifth-round draft 
choice of the Tigers, who assigned him to their Class-A New York-Penn League 
affiliate at Niagara Falls, N.Y. He is expected to report in time for the 
Rapids' game tonight against the St. Catharines (Canada) Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who probably would have been a reserve receiver again this fall behind 
starters Mike Farr and Reggie Moore, said he didn't believe that he had a 
future in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could have accomplished much more in football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he contemplated a return to UCLA this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back and forth," he said. "Then, (the Tigers) came back and gave me a 
little more money and guaranteed (they would send me to) instructional league. 
They showed they were going to take the time to work with me. That was the 
deciding factor."

The body of former Raider John Matuszak was flown home to Milwaukee, where his 
family will hold funeral services Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders will also hold a memorial service, although no date has been 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak, 38, died Saturday night after suffering heart failure. An autopsy by 
the Los Angeles County Coroner's office failed to determine the cause of death 
and a department spokesman said that the results of toxicology tests may not be 
known until next week.

Jockey Earlie Fires became the first rider in the 98-year history of Chicago's 
Hawthorne Race Course to win all six of the races in which he rode. 
</P>
<P>
Fires, 42, won the second and fourth races and then the sixth through the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The last rider who went six for six at a Chicago area track was Monk Overton, 
who had a perfect day at Washington Park, July 10, 1981. The Hawthorne record 
of seven winners on a single card was set by Johnny Heckmann, Oct. 1, 1956, but 
he had eight mounts.

DECISION ON EXPANSION TO COME IN DECEMBER

<P>
The National Hockey League Board of Governors will decide whether to expand in 
their December meeting, league President John Ziegler said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But the league will not decide details such as when and where until a later 
date, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler, in a wrap-up session at this week's annual congress, also reported on 
the status of two tours planned with the Soviet Union and defended the strategy 
behind the league's television contract with SportsChannel America. 
</P>
<P>
The board also voted to approve the transfer in ownership of the Hartford 
Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
King owner Bruce McNall, a member of the NHL's expansion committee, said the 
committee will be ready to inform the board in September whether it will have a 
recommendation for the December meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler said in Toronto last April that he expected the league to expand by two 
or three teams in the near future. He said Monday that that was an opinion, and 
not an official endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was time that I should express a personal opinion," Ziegler said. 
"I believe that the momentum is in that direction . . . my discussions with 
owners show a clear commitment to growth. . . . I thought the issue of 
expansion would be considered favorably." 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler said Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Atlanta, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Seattle, 
Portland, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, Anaheim, Dallas and Houston have 
expressed interest in starting a franchise. He also said there was interest 
from the Soviets and the Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee has probably as good a chance as any of getting one of possibly three 
franchises, although San Jose has been most visible in its lobbying efforts at 
these meetings. San Jose is also believed to have a good chance. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee has an impressive new NHL-sized arena that is home to the Admirals, 
an International Hockey League team that is the affiliate of the Vancouver 
Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
The Admirals are looking for a new coach, and former King coach Robbie Ftorek 
has been mentioned as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The Calgary Flames and the Washington Capitals will be playing exhibition games 
this fall in the Soviet Union -- in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and Riga. Four 
Soviet teams will play in the United States against all 21 NHL teams in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler is confident that both tours will take place, but there have been 
glitches. 
</P>
<P>
Travel plans for the trip to the Soviet Union have hit similar obstacles that 
caused the proposed USC-Illinois football game in Moscow to be moved back to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're entrapped in the kind of bureaucracy that Mr. (Mikhail) 
Gorbachev is trying to cut down," Ziegler said. "The problems are with the 
charters and tours we're trying to arrange for the fans. The teams are 99% 
set." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have indicated that they do not want to play at Buffalo because of 
their displeasure over the defection of their star, Alexander Mogilny, who 
hopes to play for the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
In defending the league's choice of SportsChannel over ESPN this time last year 
-- a decision that left many areas, including Los Angeles, with blanks on many 
hockey nights -- Ziegler said: "We can't prove it, but we are absolutely 
convinced that we doubled our viewership by sending telecasts into homes 
interested in hockey." 
</P>
<P>
The idea, he said, is to broadcast to areas where the TV will be tuned to the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when the league voted for SportsChannel over ESPN last year, 
SportsChannel planned to be in 10 to 12 million homes by the end of the season. 
They made it to 8.5, possibly 9 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have some gaps where we are not in markets where hockey is known," 
Ziegler said. "SportsChannel knows this is a high priority for us, and it's a 
high priority for them." 
</P>
<P>
There are two years left on the SportsChannel contract in the United States. 
Ziegler said the league went with a short-term contract because of the changing 
state of the cable TV market. He said when it comes time to negotiate again, 
the NHL will have at least two strong competitors bidding for national rights. 
</P>
<P>
As trade rumors bounced around and theories about the signing of free agents 
were discussed, the level of Bernie Nicholls' recent contract, reported at 
$750,000 a year, was becoming a measuring stick. McNall was accused of 
upsetting the league's pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
But McNall said the figures on Nicholls' salary were misleading. He said that 
it could be quoted in the "700 range" if all possible bonuses and incentives 
were figured in and if deferred money was not discounted to present value. 
</P>
<P>
McNall, however, declined to put a number on the contract that would not be 
misleading. Asked if it had to be more than $600,000 a year -- because that is 
the reported figure on Dave Taylor's contract and Nicholls has indicated that 
his salary is now second only to Wayne Gretzky's -- McNall said that figures 
reported on Taylor have been misleading, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The salaries I think are out of line are the salaries and signing bonuses 
going to some of the rookies," McNall said. "Based on those salaries, Wayne 
Gretzky is the most underpaid guy in the league." 
</P>
<P>
For the ninth consecutive season, the NHL increased attendance. A total of 
13,745,183 fans attended regular-season and playoff games this season, 
representing an increase of 18%. With a nudge from the Forum's record 
attendance, league average attendance went up from 14,577 a game to 14,906.

UAW LEADERS HOLD CONTROL IN ANAHEIM DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
ATTEMPT BY DISSIDENTS TO ALTER CONSTITUTION OF UNION BEATEN BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leadership of the United Auto Workers asserted its authority on the second 
day of the union's convention in Anaheim on Monday and quashed the efforts of a 
growing dissident faction to alter the union's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Top union officers said their hard-line approach toward the dissidents in the 
first two days of the UAW convention at the Anaheim Convention Center shows 
that they have no plans to compromise with the fledgling opposition group. 
</P>
<P>
"They have done damage to this union, and that is an unforgivable sin," said 
UAW Vice President Don Ephlin, director of the union's huge General Motors 
Department. "Why should we throw a bone to them?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflect Union's Leadership 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the international union later said Ephlin's comments reflect 
the position of UAW President Owen Bieber and the rest of the union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The group of internal dissidents, called New Directions, has sharp 
philosophical differences with the union's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents oppose the UAW's new willingness to cooperate more closely with 
management in the auto industry through Japanese-style "team-concept" labor 
agreements and other joint programs. They argue that such programs have led to 
speed-ups on assembly lines and heavier workloads, but have not provided the 
job security originally promised by management. They charge that the UAW's 
present leaders -- unlike the union's legendary architect, Walter Reuther -- 
have accepted the corporations' views on international competition, to the 
detriment of the membership. 
</P>
<P>
"Walter Reuther organized the membership of this union around its own agenda, 
but today the union is being organized around the corporations' agenda," said 
Jerry Tucker, a UAW regional director and leader of New Directions. 
</P>
<P>
But Bieber and other union leaders argue that labor-management programs are 
needed to remain competitive in the global marketplace, and they criticize the 
dissidents for failing to understand the harsh new competitive realities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chance to Launch Opposition 
</P>
<P>
The dissident movement had hoped to use the six-day convention as a launching 
pad for a more organized opposition to the UAW leadership. The dissident 
leaders planned to challenge election results in several recent races for top 
union positions and to force a debate on a range of collective bargaining and 
fundamental political issues facing the union. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, the New Directions group has been soundly defeated at every turn. 
On Sunday, most of their appeals of election results were rejected by the 
convention, ensuring the defeat of Tucker and another dissident, both of whom 
ran for top union positions this spring. In both cases, the dissident group is 
likely to challenge the election results in court. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the dissidents were defeated in their bid to change the UAW's 
constitution to call for the direct election of top union officers by the 
union's rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
The rank and file now elects delegates to the convention, who then elect the 
UAW's president and other officers. 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents argue that a direct election would spur debate on the basic 
issues facing the union. But the leadership responds that a direct election 
would open up the process to outside interests and would lead to expensive 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the direct election resolution was soundly defeated, and the 
dissidents had to acknowledge that they did not have enough power to win any of 
their convention-floor battles with the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a one-party union, there is no doubt about that," complained Pete 
Kelly, president of UAW Local 160 and a leader of New Directions. "But I don't 
think we came here thinking we could win. We came here to organize our group, 
to organize local union leaders into a group that can win in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly added that New Directions still expects to announce this week that it 
will create a more formal opposition organization, with a staff, to carry on 
the dissident movement's work after the convention.

IT'S A TRICKY CALLING, BUT THESE SELF-APPOINTED MERGER EXPERTS ARE MORE IN 
DEMAND THAN EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Mention, just in passing, that it's been a while since you've had a date, and 
their eyes light up. They know someone who's just perfect. Someone who will 
treat you better than those bums (or prima donnas) you used to see. Someone who 
will understand your slobbery Great Dane, need to work late occasionally, child 
with dirt-caked fingernails, (fill in the blank). 
</P>
<P>
They arrange a meeting, suggest an exchange of telephone numbers or invite you 
both over for a simple, absolutely no-pressure dinner. Just in case. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every one who's single seems to know at least one of these 
self-appointed matchmakers, zealous fixer-uppers who aren't in it for the money 
but for the sheer joy of proving Noah had a point about pairs. And, of course, 
for the chance to show that they're good enough at matchmaking to make a date 
work at least through dessert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some 'Don't Find Each Other' 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter, some say, of demand not locating supply. "There are a lot of 
wonderful people in the world who just don't find each other," says Judie 
Framan, a Sierra Madre public relations consultant and self-described 
matchmaking maven. "And it's a yenta's job to help." 
</P>
<P>
While there's no research-based profile of these self-appointed merger experts, 
psychologists say helpful, nurturing personalities lean toward the practice. 
"Being able to help is important to their self-image," says Gary Emery, a Los 
Angeles psychologist. For matchmakers, "there's great satisfaction in 
connecting people," adds Irene Goldenberg, a UCLA family psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Women are more likely than men to practice matchmaking without a license, a 
random search for such people suggests. And at least one Jewish woman, public 
relations consultant Renee Miller, believes it's an ethnically ingrained 
practice, one she learned at her parents' knees. Whatever the habit's origin, 
most matchmakers stay with it. Framan, for instance, began fixing people up 
about 25 years ago, soon after her father took her to see "Fiddler on the 
Roof." Shari Able, a West Los Angeles psychologist-writer, arranged dates for 
five friends for her high school senior prom and hasn't stopped matchmaking 
since. Barbara McFadden, an Oakland matchmaking maven, laughs that "matchmaking 
is a disease." 
</P>
<P>
As that comment suggests, the life of a self-appointed matrimonial agent is not 
easy. It's not all wine, roses and blissful strolls through Bullock's china 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the job, matchmakers will tell you, is to cajole the less-than-willing, 
hold the hands of the mortally wounded ("I don't want to get hurt again") and 
calm the commitment-phobics ("It's just dinner, not a proposal"). Matchmakers 
learn quickly to focus on strong points. ("No, he's not 6 feet tall, but he's a 
gourmet cook and treats his mother like a queen.") 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, matchmakers say they notice an increased willingness on the 
part of single friends to accept blind dates, perhaps because long working 
hours, long commutes and sprawling geography hinder the hunt for dates. And the 
risk of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases may have persuaded many 
singles of the desirability of a predate personal reference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doing the Footwork 
</P>
<P>
Matchmakers definitely make the job easier, especially for those who feel they 
don't make a good first impression and balk at asking for a phone number, notes 
Marc Schoen, a Woodland Hills psychologist. "If that first meeting is arranged 
by the matchmaker," he says, "some of that difficult footwork is already done." 
</P>
<P>
There are a million ways to ease people together, matchmakers will tell you. 
</P>
<P>
Framan prefers to host a dinner party of several people, mixing the seeking 
singles in with couples and others. That's more gracious and less awkward than 
simply throwing two people together, she believes. And it's less disconcerting 
for her husband, Elliot, who finds her matchmaking efforts embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
McFadden, on the other hand, regularly discusses her hobby with her husband, 
Chuck, whom she accuses of being a closet matchmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Another marriage broker who recently printed a four-page flyer to accompany her 
birthday party invitation, describing guests by occupation and avocation but 
not by name, gently forcing people to mingle and -- who knows? -- find someone 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pointed Out New Car 
</P>
<P>
Some matchmakers are even sneakier. Consider the Los Angeles hairdresser who 
scheduled a haircut for a single father's son right before a single mother's 
appointment. She made sure everyone was introduced and instigated some small 
talk -- "Oh, my. Your sons are the same age." Next, she discreetly pointed out 
the father's shiny new Jaguar parked outside the salon. 
</P>
<P>
Other matchmakers are more straightforward, simply asking for permission to 
give out names and phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
And some matchmakers are successful because they practice reverse psychology, 
however unwittingly. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, Bobbie Minami, a Torrance social worker, talked about a 
wonderful woman friend to another friend, Rholan Wong, a Pasadena public 
relations executive. His interest sparked, Wong asked for the woman's number. 
Minami refused, explaining: "I don't think you're suitable for each other." 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of challenge Wong couldn't resist. "I kept after her and 
finally got her friend's number," he recalled recently. He asked out the mutual 
friend, Debbie Yim, for dinner. Several months later, over dinner at Casa Lopez 
in Gardena, Yim accepted Wong's marriage proposal. Married three years, they're 
the parents of 2-year-old Derek. And Wong's happiness is music to any 
matchmaker's ears: "I'm married to the most wonderful woman in Los Angeles," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defining Success 
</P>
<P>
Most other matchmakers have similar success stories. "I have five successful 
matches to my credit," crows Framan, who defines success as marriage or a 
longterm relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Some matches turn out successfully despite the fact they didn't look at all 
promising initially, matchmakers concur. Psychologist Able, for instance, 
thought long and hard before suggesting a blind date between her dentist friend 
and her film editor friend. She thought the dentist, accustomed to working in 
sterile conditions, might find the film editor too untidy for his tastes. But 
then she noticed the editor's immaculate cutting-room floor. Today, the couple 
are married with two children. 
</P>
<P>
For every success story, of course, there seems to be a disaster story. Framan 
remembers fixing up her entomologist friend and her artist friend. A match that 
seemed a natural, she explains, because both loved opera. "I got great reports 
from both after a trip to the opera," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The next date, they told her, was a picnic. How quaint, Framan thought. But the 
romance soured quicker than potato salad on a 100-degree day. "The 
entomologist's idea of a picnic was completely different than the artist's," 
she explains. "This man never went anywhere without a butterfly net. And she 
hated bugs. She was furious later. How could I introduce her to this 
barbarian?" 
</P>
<P>
"Barbarian?" Framan protests, still a hint of disappointment in her voice. "He 
likes opera." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quit After Three Dates 
</P>
<P>
McFadden can sympathize. She and her husband, after much deliberation, 
introduced two mutual friends. "We were both of the opinion it would go," 
McFadden says. Her prediction seemed sound after Date 1, which went well. "I 
really thought I'd done it," McFadden says wistfully. "But three dates and he 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
When a Los Angeles man fixed up two mutual friends, he thought they were a nice 
match. But he hadn't bothered to poll them about the ideal speed of courtship. 
"I was blamed when the man started to move too fast," says the matchmaker, who 
abandoned the practice immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, singles who rely on their friends as matchmakers expect too much. 
When it comes to post-date complaints, Able thinks she's heard them all. "He's 
too short, too educated, too involved with his kids, not involved enough. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
"Matchmaking is risky business," acknowledges psychologist Emery. "It might not 
work out. Or it might work out," he quips, "and then they can really hold you 
accountable." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are downsides to the matchmaking game, especially between 
friends. Those who rely on matchmakers too much can become "passive daters," 
Schoen says, never looking around themselves for potential dates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living Vicariously 
</P>
<P>
And matchmakers can become too invested in their work, perhaps living 
vicariously through their efforts, or becoming even more disappointed than the 
couple when a romance fails. There's the danger, too, of giving single friends 
the idea that you don't think of them as "whole" people simply because they're 
not married or in a relationship, psychologists say. 
</P>
<P>
For both matchmakers and matched, a middle-ground approach seems best, experts 
say. For the matched, they advise: Don't rely so much on matchmakers that you 
stop searching for dates yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Advice for the matchmakers: Be cool. "If you do fix someone up, it should be a 
very casual situation," UCLA's Goldenberg says. "And a date doesn't have to be 
dinner. It can just be coffee." 
</P>
<P>
Difficult as it might be, matchmakers should stay as uninvested in a budding 
romance as possible, psychologists add. They should stifle the urge to ask for 
minute-by-minute accounting of the date, along with the urge to phone the next 
day "just to say hello." 
</P>
<P>
Even if they have to sit on their hands a while.

EXPENSE ACCOUNT LIVING: CHARGE! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
There were sympathetic snickers in some parts of town after City Controller 
Rick Tuttle scolded Department of Water and Power officials who had tried to 
dine elegantly on city expense accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Outrageous," Tuttle huffed about a $1,013 lunch for 25. "Unreasonable," he 
raged recently, denying payment of an $879 dinner tab for 12. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeff Wald, for one, wasn't angry. "I laughed when I read about the DWP," 
says the president of television and management at Barris-Guber-Peters. "Those 
Power Department guys should have had a power lunch. Someplace like Morton's or 
Spago, instead of the Jonathan Club. They didn't show any power at all." 
</P>
<P>
Wald is one of many who understand that expense account lunches -- and dinners 
and wardrobes and laundry and limos -- are the oil that greases much of Los 
Angeles life. Without T&amp;E tabs (travel and entertainment accounts), many of 
the city's seemingly rich would live just as modestly as the rest of us. And 
let those who have never taken home a pencil or made a personal phone call from 
the office cast the first stone. 
</P>
<P>
Wald remembers bygone days when expense accounts paid for chartered yachts on 
which he held power meals. But now, "this is a publicly owned company and we 
don't spend stockholders' money frivolously," he adds. "Nobody here even flies 
first class -- I exclude myself, of course." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multiple Meals 
</P>
<P>
Producer Rob Cohen says most filmland types wouldn't relate to Tuttle's ire. 
"Many executives double and triple-book their meals," he explains. "They have 
multiple breakfasts, lunches and dinners. They go to the Polo Lounge, then they 
take a 7:30 and a 9:30 dinner, all of which they pay for and put on their 
expense accounts." 
</P>
<P>
Why eat thrice in one night? "It's partly a sense of grandiosity, and partly a 
way to pack more business into the day in a context in which the parent company 
pays for it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who produced "Witches of Eastwick" and is working on "Bird on a Wire" 
with Goldie Hawn and Mel Gibson, thinks Los Angeles' expense-account phenomenon 
may never fade. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood," he says, "is a town of illusion, and one of the greatest illusions 
of all is the glamorous public life that people lead. Almost all of that is 
paid for by studios and expense accounts." 
</P>
<P>
There's a positive side to it, he claims. Expense account meals are "a kind of 
upper-class welfare system in which people who are doing well take people who 
are not doing well out to a public place" where everyone who sees them thinks 
they're all doing well. 
</P>
<P>
So much for glamour folks whose sense of ethics might be affected by the need 
to keep their images afloat. But what about more righteous types, like 
journalists, who sometimes risk their lives to bring America the news? 
</P>
<P>
"They can be the worst," Peter Greenberg says with a laugh. Greenberg, a Los 
Angeles-based syndicated columnist, says expensive meals are of minor interest 
compared to some of the tall tabs submitted by foreign reporters at a news 
magazine where he once worked. A favorite story, he says, concerns a 
correspondent who did such good work that no one questioned his huge expense 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
"One night, this guy made a pretty bad mistake. He drank heavily, got into his 
Lancia and hit a local gendarme on the way home," Greenberg says. "Magazine 
execs rescued him from jail and almost fired him on the spot -- not because he 
drank and hit a policeman, but because they couldn't figure out how he could 
afford a Lancia unless it was from padding his expense account." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Large Taxi Bill 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg also likes the absurd tale of the magazine reporter who did a story 
on "a day in the life of an aircraft carrier," then submitted a $435 taxi bill. 
"Why did he use taxis on that assignment?" the accountants asked. "Do you know 
how immense an airline carrier is?" the reporter shot back. Greenberg says the 
reporter got paid, in appreciation for his wit.

The Japanese contingent in Los Angeles doesn't like to do deals over meals. 
They prefer to play golf while getting business done, says Kiku Kurahashi of A. 
T. Cosmo and Co., a local firm that makes commercials for Japanese clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing golf with colleagues is one of the most elitist things to do" among 
the Japanese, she says, adding that the "ultimate" treat for visiting Japanese 
tycoons is "to be taken to a great golf course at a prestigious country club." 
</P>
<P>
Kurahashi says Los Angeles affiliates of Japanese-based firms often maintain 
corporate memberships at golf clubs here, so business visitors can head 
straight for the links. Expense account business gifts also tend to focus on 
golf equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cars in the Budget 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, tales are legion of high-priced cars charged to corporate 
expense accounts, although those who tell the stories don't want to be quoted 
and can't prove they're true. Apocryphal or not, there is, for example, one 
story circulating about eight BMWs allegedly purchased for one film; the cars 
disappeared -- driven home, the story goes, by members of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing also seems a big expense-account indulgence. Rick Pallack, a Sherman 
Oaks menswear shop owner, says some networks provide expense account clothes 
budgets for news anchors and other celebrities who "have to look good." Other 
top shopkeepers in town say sales of high-ticket fashions would drop 
precipitously if expense account spending were seriously curtailed. This, 
though most corporate employees -- even the top dogs -- technically are not 
permitted to put clothing on expense accounts. "If they see a blouse they like, 
they buy it and then cover the cost by faking one or two high-price lunches on 
their next expense account," one retailer says. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most publicized examples of a dispute over expense accounts and 
clothing occurred in 1981. Dennis Stanfill, then chairman of Twentieth Century 
Fox, accused Fox Television chairman Harris Katleman of submitting restaurant 
expenses supported by invoices, which, in fact, represented charges at a Paris 
clothing store. That problem was resolved when Marvin Davis took over the 
studio, where Katleman is now president of television production. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, employees feel entitled to a particular purchase, even if 
the company refuses to pay. A classic case, cited by Wald, involves a music 
company executive who lost his favorite $150 hat at a concert. He bought a new 
hat, charged the company by expense account but was refused reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
"Three times he tried and was rejected," Wald recalls. "The fourth time, he 
inflated his expense report with $150 worth of allowable items and wrote a note 
saying 'You find the hat.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Watch 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the salaried president of the nonprofit Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. 
made what she called an "error in judgment" by charging a $5,000 Rolex watch on 
a credit card provided to her strictly for business use. That same year, San 
Francisco's top welfare official, on an annual salary of $93,000, resigned 
after charging $2,141 in restaurant bills to a $4,000 city fund intended to 
help feed the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Though some cases of expense account abuse are clear, lines between right and 
wrong, between chicanery and crime, tend to blur in many discussions of their 
use. 
</P>
<P>
But ethics, defined by Webster as "standards of conduct and moral judgment," is 
just beginning to be taught at business schools. And Business Ethics only 
recently became a mandatory course for students at Harvard's graduate school of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Tuttle's office continues to set a "reasonable and prudent" standard 
for employees' expense account dinners by "calling a number of places" 
considered appropriate. Like The Velvet Turtle, where Tuttle reports a meal can 
be purchased for $5.95 to $13.95.

A North Hollywood teen-ager died this morning after a possibly gang-related 
shooting at a Pacoima housing project, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old boy, whose name was not released pending notification of his 
family, was found at 12:30 a.m. lying in the intersection of Carl Street and 
Carl Place in the San Fernando Gardens housing complex, Detective Al Ferrand 
said. The youth had been shot in the upper body and was taken to Pacifica 
Hospital of the Valley, where he died a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand said that there was no known motive for the attack but that the 
intersection where the youth was found is a known hangout for Pacoima gang 
members. He said detectives were still attempting to find witnesses to the 
shooting.

SPONSORS AVOID WALTER'S RADIO SPECIAL ON ABORTION 
</P>

<P>
National advertisers are refusing to buy commercial time on an ABC radio 
network special hosted by Barbara Walters that will deal with the topic of 
abortion, ABC executives said today. 
</P>
<P>
But ABC executives said they intend to run the program even if no paying 
sponsors turn up before the 54-minute special airs Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be the topic," said Lou Severine, senior vice president of sales 
for the ABC radio network. "They are scared to death of the abortion topic. . . 
. They just don't want to be involved with any controversy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear of Offending 
</P>
<P>
It is the latest example of advertisers backing way from programs that have 
either offended or risk offending individuals or groups who are increasingly 
vocal about their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC television network, for instance, had to cut prices to find buyers for 
ad time in the made-for-TV movie "Roe Vs. Wade," which ran last month and dealt 
with the case that led to the Supreme Court's 1973 decision that legalized 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers have also backed out of shows such as NBC's "Saturday Night Live" 
and the Fox television network's "Married . . . With Children" after 
individuals or groups complained that they were offended by sexual references 
or profanity in the shows. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC television network canceled two reality-based shows earlier this year 
because no advertisers signed up. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Farley, executive producer of the upcoming radio special on abortion, 
said no one has called for a boycott in connection with the special. 
</P>
<P>
The show will feature Walters as moderator for a panel that will include two 
people from each side of the abortion question and will invite listeners to 
call in with comments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is different. This is the news. It will be a straightforward, fair and 
balanced discussion of the issues," Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
Severine would not identify any of the sponsors refusing to buy some of the six 
minutes of national ad time on the program. He said the only buyer was ABC's 
"20-20" television program, which bought a one-minute spot. 
</P>
<P>
He said the unfilled national ad time will be used for public service 
announcements such as anti-drug or anti-crime messages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$6,000 Per Minute 
</P>
<P>
The time was being offered at a rate of $6,000 per minute, he said. No effort 
was made to reduce the price to attract sponsors. "It was never really the 
money," Severine said. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Giordano, senior vice president at the ABC radio network, said 144 radio 
stations, including stations in 21 of the nation's 25 biggest radio markets, 
have agreed to carry the abortion special and should attract an audience of 1.1 
million adults. 
</P>
<P>
He said there were some local stations that were reluctant about carrying the 
program because of the topic.

BROTHERS EXPECTED TO FACE MURDER COUNTS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH DEATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach police are expected to seek murder charges against two 
brothers who are suspects in the beating of their cousin who died of injuries 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Saldivar, 34, and his brother Pedro, 29, were booked on suspicion of 
murder after their cousin, Mario Guzman, 39, died at Huntington Humana 
Hospital. The two allegedly used their hands and feet to beat Guzman, following 
an argument at 5 a.m. on Sunday, said Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Bill 
Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics were summoned nearly five hours after the fight, and Guzman was 
treated in the hospital's intensive care unit. When his condition worsened 
Monday afternoon, hospital officials called Huntington Beach police. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman died in the operating room, before surgery could begin for his chest and 
abdominal injuries, according to hospital spokeswoman Joyce Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
Police do not know what sparked the fight, and several witnesses -- other 
relatives who shared the apartment with the brothers and Guzman -- refused to 
say, according to Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy to determine the cause of death was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco and Pedro Saldivar, both employed as laborers, were being held in the 
Huntington Beach city jail.

A political crisis and new elections loomed today as conservative leader 
Constantine Mitsotakis was given three days to form a government but was 
rejected by a possible left-wing coalition partner. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mitsotakis' New Democracy Party and the communist-dominated leftist 
alliance, which together won nearly 60% of Sunday's vote, say a new government 
first must punish those responsible for the scandals of the defeated socialist 
administration of Premier Andreas Papandreou. 
</P>
<P>
But the alliance of the pro-Soviet Greek Communist Party and the Greek Left 
Party, which finished third, turned down Mitsotakis' offer to join in an 
interim government that would investigate the corruption.

SWINDALL CONVICTED OF LYING IN PROBE OF MONEY LAUNDERING 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Rep. Pat Swindall was convicted today of nine counts of perjury for 
lying to a federal grand jury about a money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old conservative Republican, who served two terms in Congress from 
Atlanta's suburbs before being defeated in November, could receive up to five 
years in prison plus fines of $250,000 on each count at sentencing Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Swindall left the courtroom saying he was "numb, disappointed, but not terribly 
surprised," as his wife, Kim, stood behind him, wearing a lilac maternity dress 
and clutching his hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have Been Forgiven' 
</P>
<P>
"I had said months before that I had gotten into something," Swindall said, 
referring to a tearful apology he issued after the case became public last 
year. "I confessed publicly and openly, and for that I feel I have been 
forgiven by God and my constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to do whatever I have to do. If I have to go to prison, I'll go 
to prison and I'll have a good attitude about it." 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated 17 hours over four days after nearly four weeks of 
testimony. Swindall was indicted in October on 10 counts of perjury. U.S. 
District Judge Richard C. Freeman dismissed one count during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The former congressman was accused of lying to a grand jury in 1988 about his 
1987 negotiations with an IRS agent posing as a drug-money launderer and with 
Swindall associate Charles LeChasney, later convicted of money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Swindall was found guilty of perjury for denying that he 
had been told that the $850,000 he was seeking from the agent to finish 
building his luxurious home contained proceeds from drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Planned 
</P>
<P>
Swindall's chief attorney, Richard Hendrix, said he will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Swindall, a lanky, boyish lawyer, went to Congress in 1984 from the city's 
affluent eastern suburbs as a conservative, fundamentalist Christian. Under the 
cloud of the perjury indictment, he lost to Democrat Ben Jones, who appeared in 
"The Dukes of Hazzard" television series. 
</P>
<P>
The jury heard secretly taped conversations with the undercover agent, Mike 
Mullaney, in which Swindall was told that the $850,000 "certainly" included 
drug money and that he would be part of an operation to "wash" cash. Swindall 
proposed that a mortgage company be set up by LeChasney as a "buffer" to allow 
him to "borrow" the agent's money. 
</P>
<P>
In their last conversation after Swindall had received a $150,000 advance, he 
told Mullaney, "If Charles wants to launder y'all's money, fine. But I can't do 
that. . . . I can borrow the money from Charles." 
</P>
<P>
Swindall was a largely unknown lawyer and furniture store owner when he was 
elected in an upset in 1984, toppling veteran Democrat Elliott Levitas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Biblical Score Card' 
</P>
<P>
Swindall, a Presbyterian, took his campaign to evangelical churches, 
distributing a "Biblical score card" in his race against Levitas, who is 
Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
In his two terms, Swindall staunchly voted with the Reagan right and acquired a 
reputation as somewhat of a gadfly, voting against such popular programs as 
school lunch funding and aid to African famine victims. He filed a brief with 
the Supreme Court advocating the teaching of "creationism" in schools.

The United States has urged China to grant clemency to demonstrators sentenced 
to death in Beijing and Shanghai and to pardon those who were arrested in 
pro-democracy protests, the White House said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Sentences of death in Shanghai and Beijing could only deepen the wounds of the 
past few weeks," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in 
announcing that the U.S. appeal had been delivered to Chinese Ambassador Han Xu 
on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater declined to say what, if any, steps the United States might take if 
China goes ahead with executions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intensify Condemnation 
</P>
<P>
The White House announcement came on the heels of demands in Congress and 
elsewhere that the United States intensify its condemnation of Chinese 
repression and consider further sanctions against the Beijing government. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Han was called in to the State Department to hear what the 
spokesman called "the strong United States position." 
</P>
<P>
Hinting at worsening relations between Beijing and Washington, Fitzwater said 
"the United States raised this subject in the spirit of a country that has 
worked with China over the past two decades to improve relations." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that human rights are universal, and our duty to comment on them is 
great," Fitzwater said.

VATICAN PICKS 5 LAYMEN TO RUN TROUBLED BANK

<P>
The Vatican today turned over the management of its scandal-tainted bank to 
financial experts not connected with the clergy, ending the 20-year presidency 
of American Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. businessman and bankers from Italy, Spain, Switzerland and West Germany 
were named to the bank's supervisory board. They will select a director and 
deputy director, also laymen. 
</P>
<P>
"In principle, laymen should be more competent in financial affairs than 
clerics," said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
The appointments take effect immediately, Navarro said. They were the latest 
step in a sweeping management reform announced in March that also established a 
special commission of five cardinals for the bank, which is formally called the 
Institute for Religious Works. 
</P>
<P>
The reform abolished the post of president, which has been held since 1969 by 
the 67-year-old Marcinkus, a native of Cicero, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Marcinkus, long a Vatican power, retains another post, the equivalent of deputy 
governor of the Vatican city-state. 
</P>
<P>
Warrants for the arrest of Marcinkus and two lay Vatican bank officials were 
issued in 1987 after Italian prosecutors charged them with being accessories to 
the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano, a Milan-based bank that 
collapsed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But the arrests never were carried out. Italy's Constitutional Court ruled that 
a Vatican-Italian treaty precluded any interference by Italian authorities in 
the affairs of the Vatican, an independent city-state. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican denied wrongdoing in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano but agreed in 
1984 to pay $250 million to its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Named to the supervisory board were Angelo Caloia, chairman of Italy's 
Mediocredito Lombardo; Philippe De Weck, former chairman of Union Bank of 
Switzerland; Jose A. Sanchez Asiain, co-chairman of Spain's Banco Bilbao 
Vizcaya; Theodor E. Pietzcker, a director of West Germany's Deutsche Bank, and 
Thomas M. Macioce, former chairman and chief executive officer of Allied Stores 
Corp. in New York.

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., the textbook publisher that fended off a 
hostile takeover bid in 1987 but tripled its debt in the process, said today 
that it will sell its theme parks and land holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the sale of six theme parks, including Sea World in San Diego, 
and others in Florida, Texas and Ohio, will allow it to substantially reduce 
its debt and boost investment in its publishing and insurance businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Harcourt also owns two other parks in central Florida -- Cypress Gardens, and 
Boardwalk and Baseball. The company's real estate holdings include land 
surrounding its three Florida parks and Sea World in Texas, as well as land 
next to Orlando International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An About-Face 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale represents an about-face for the company. Harcourt, which 
sold about $370 million in assets in the fourth quarter of 1987, including a 
magazine publishing business, previously said it planned no other asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst expressed surprise at the announcement for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought the theme parks were not strongly connected to the media 
business. However, they adamantly denied that they had any intention of selling 
them," said J. Kendrick Noble Jr. of PaineWebber Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Noble noted that the parks did not perform as well as expected in 1988, and he 
said that may have influenced the company's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The parks accounted for $338 million of Harcourt's $1.8 billion in revenues in 
1988, and showed an operating profit of $61.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut Expenses 
</P>
<P>
However, Harcourt dramatically cut expenses at the parks last year. In August, 
the company trimmed 700 jobs at its six parks.

A Chrysler Corp. spokesman said today that the auto maker will begin returning 
its handful of U.S. workers to Beijing this week after being assured by Chinese 
officials that the situation is safe. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris said the nation's No. 3 car maker will return 
two U.S. consultants to Beijing Jeep Corp. starting this week and eight U.S. 
employees next month. 
</P>
<P>
"The chairman of Beijing Jeep is telling us things are safe and that things are 
returning to normal," Harris said. "He has said the parts flow seems to be 
normal and the demonstration seems to be over." 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler pulled its U.S. workers out of Beijing on June 5, just after the first 
shooting in Tian An Men Square.

Three union leaders jailed for encouraging strikers to block mine entrances 
were freed today after promising to obey a judge's restrictions, raising hopes 
for an end to a wildcat walkout by 27,000 miners in nine states. 
</P>
<P>
The United Mine Workers officials said after leaving the judge's chambers that 
they can win their dispute against the Pittston Coal Group despite the judge's 
ban on tactics such as sit-down demonstrations to block coal trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"This strike is still building," said strike coordinator Marty Hudson as a 
cheering crowd of about 35 striking miners and family members waited outside 
the court of U.S. District Judge Glen Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no white flags on these hands. We're going to win this strike. We're 
not turning back," Hudson said.

The Pentagon plans to begin paying the full cost of national weapons 
development, a major shift that could save defense contractors billions of 
dollars a year, defense officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The officials confirmed remarks made by Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood 
in an interview with the Washington Post. Atwood said the department will make 
the recommendation to the White House as part of a Pentagon management review. 
</P>
<P>
No specific dollar savings for industry were announced. Under a practice begun 
by the Ronald Reagan Administration, many defense companies pay up to 50% of 
the cost of developing specific weapons.

SANTA MONICA RUNNERS CAN'T COMPETE AGAINST NATIONAL TEAMS, FEDERATION SAYS

Olympic champion Carl Lewis and three club teammates on an 800-meter relay team 
were barred from an international track meet this weekend by the sport's U.S. 
governing body, British officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The British Amateur Athletics Board said it had been told by The Athletics 
Congress, U.S. track's ruling federation, that Lewis and three other members of 
the Santa Monica Track Club had been refused permission to compete. 
</P>
<P>
TAC denied, however, that it banned the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the power to ban athletes at a meet on British soil," Pete Cava, 
a public information spokesman for TAC, said at the organization's headquarters 
in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"Our contract with the meet promoter calls for the national team to compete, 
and the four athletes are not on our four by two relay team." 
</P>
<P>
"We told the British that if they wanted a four by two relay team from the 
United States, the national team would supply one." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, the Soviet Union, West Germany and Britain meet at Alexandra 
Stadium Friday and Saturday in one of the major events of the European track 
season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Set Sights on France 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Lewis' business manager, Joe Douglas, said Lewis and his teammates 
will try to set a world record in the 4x200 meters in France Friday instead. 
</P>
<P>
"If they won't let us run there, (in Birmingham) we will go to St. Denis 
(France) and try to break the world record there," Douglas told Reuters news 
service. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is we won't have any competition. If we had run in England, the 
Soviets have a good team and we could have possibly set the record there. Now 
it will be more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, Olympic 200-meter champion Joe DeLoach and Danny Everett, all from the 
Santa Monica Track Club, did not compete in the U.S. track and field 
championships last weekend in Houston, where the U.S. team was picked. The 
fourth Santa Monica runner, Floyd Heard, won the 200-meter run at the meet with 
a 20.9 clocking. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica athletes and TAC have been feuding, but Lewis has denied he 
boycotted the meet. Everett was graduated from UCLA on the day of the finals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Running as Independents 
</P>
<P>
The four planned to run at Birmingham as an independent squad to try to break 
the world record in the 800-meter relay. They would have run against four 
national teams, including the British squad led by Linford Christie, who 
finished second to Lewis in the Olympic 100 meters last summer. 
</P>
<P>
But the British board said it had been told by TAC executive director Ollan 
Cassell that U.S. club teams would not be allowed to run against national teams 
in meets where a U.S. national squad was competing.

GIBBS CHOSEN TO REPLACE SWITZER

University of Oklahoma officials today chose defensive coordinator Gary Gibbs 
to replace Barry Switzer, who resigned Monday as football coach at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
The university's regents will vote on the selection Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary Gibbs is one of the outstanding young coaches in the United States 
today," interim President David Swank said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Played on Sooners Team 
</P>
<P>
Swank said Gibbs, who played for the Sooners in college, also understands that 
the university's mission is to educate the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, 36, appeared confident about taking on a job he said he had always 
desired. He brushed off questions about the pressure involved in following 
Switzer, the most successful coach in Oklahoma's history. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Gary Gibbs. I know what I can do," Gibbs said. "Your comparison is your 
comparison. We're going to go forward and make this thing happen." 
</P>
<P>
Swank recommended Gibbs over two other assistant coaches -- Merv Johnson and 
Jim Donnan. He said the choice was difficult to make. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said he would evaluate his options before deciding what changes will be 
made in the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be in complete control of the football program," Gibbs told the news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We will once again make people proud to associate with the University of 
Oklahoma," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs noted the problems that have plagued the football program in recent 
months, including the arrest of five players on a variety of charges and the 
NCAA probation imposed in December. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Remove That Cloud' 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to remove that cloud," Gibbs said. "If we perform the way we're 
capable, if we do those things . . . we're going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Switzer had recommended that the next coach be promoted from within. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs' only college experience -- as a player and a coach -- has been at 
Oklahoma. He played linebacker on the 1974 national championship team and has 
moved his way through the ranks as an assistant coach, becoming defensive 
coordinator in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"OU has a history of young coaches rising to the top," Athletic Director Donnie 
Duncan said. "In the years to come you'll understand why I made the 
recommendation to name Gary Gibbs as head football coach."
