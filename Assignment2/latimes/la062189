NEWSMAKERS: EXPERT TUTORS SCHOLARS WITH A CRASH COURSE IN CIVICS

President Bush offered a lesson in civic responsibility to 141 teen-agers who 
are this year's Presidential Scholars. Calling them "some of the best and 
brightest students in American education," Bush said: "While already you've 
done much, I know you will do more -- and not for yourselves alone, but for 
nation and neighbor." Bush was joined by his wife, Barbara, and Secretary of 
Education Lauro F. Cavazos for the White House ceremony. The scholars were 
chosen by a commission. They were treated in Washington to a five-day whirlwind 
of seminars, speeches, dinners and festivities that concludes today.

 -- Buckingham Palace has some uninvited guests. A spokeswoman for Britain's 
royal family said that experts had been called in to fight off Guernsey carpet 
beetles, whose hairy grubs are munching their way through carpets in several 
rooms. But she declined to comment on reports that the insects had also 
devoured dresses belonging to the Duchess of York, the wife of Prince Andrew. 
Pest control expert Peter Bateman said the grubs, nicknamed "woolly bears" 
because they are covered in brown hairs, are "fairly tough little blighters." 
He added: The beetles "are often brought into homes in second-hand clothing, 
but I don't think Her Majesty would have too much of that around."

 -- In the 30th anniversary year of his best known artwork, Frank Gasparro is 
still not a household name. Gasparro designed the tails side of the penny that 
replaced the wheat-back penny in 1959. His initials can be found to the right 
of the Lincoln Memorial's base. Occasionally when he gets a penny in change, he 
will point out his work to the cashier. "I'll say: 'I designed it, you can see 
my initials if you've got good eyesight,' " the former chief engraver of the 
United States, who worked at the Philadelphia Mint, said. As the man who 
designed the Susan B. Anthony dollar, he is the only living person to have 
sculpted the front and back of a general-circulation U.S. coin. He also 
designed the back of the John F. Kennedy half dollar. Gasparro recalled that 
when he presented his penny design, his superiors told him to remove the words 
"Lincoln Memorial" and 13 stars around the edge of the coin. Gasparro agreed, 
but refused to take out his initials and the tiny statue of Lincoln between the 
sixth and seventh columns, two features his boss said would look like smudges 
of dirt. SHIRLEY MARLOW

MILITARY AID TO CAMBODIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Operation California flew the very first American relief plane into 
famine-ravaged Cambodia on Thanksgiving Day, 1979. We were accompanied by a 
Times reporter (Ellen Hume) who bore witness to the incredible devastation 
wrought in just 3 1/2 years by the brutal Khmer Rouge regime led by Pol Pot. 
</P>
<P>
It mystifies me why Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.) can advocate ("Military Aid 
Would Help Avoid a Return to the Killing Fields," Op-Ed Page, May 31) further 
arms for the resistance forces of both Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the ex-Prime 
Minister Son Sann's faction. Both led regimes which (with full American 
military support) failed to keep the Khmer Rouge from taking over Cambodia in 
April, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
To visit the Thailand-Cambodia frontier periodically over the past 10 years is 
to know clearly and convincingly that the non-communist Cambodian resistance 
has failed miserably to mount more than a token military presence which has had 
no effect on the Vietnam-backed Hun Sen regime and which, in fact, has fought 
more military battles against their "allies" the Khmer Rouge for control over 
refugee populations, black markets and clandestine trade routes into the center 
of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Arming these factions is not necessarily what they themselves want (indeed, 
most observers believe they will abandon their alliance with the Khmer Rouge, 
return to the capitol of Phnom Penh and share power with the incumbent Hun Sen 
government). Solarz probably was vehement in his opposition to President 
Reagan's plans for building and deploying the MX missile but is falling into 
the same trap as Reagan used so often: the bargaining chips for later 
negotiation. In this case, there have been 2 million lives lost and shedding 
more blood will help no one.

INCINERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to "Judge Clears Way for Building of Toxic Waste 
Incinerator," Metro, June 2. 
</P>
<P>
I'm amazed that so soon after the environmental disaster in Alaska that a 
Superior Court judge would order the issuance of construction permits to allow 
for a toxic waste incinerator to be built without a full environmental impact 
report being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kurt Lewin ordered the incinerators' developers to use state-of-the-art 
anti-pollution equipment -- who's going to monitor the construction to insure 
the equipment installation? 
</P>
<P>
I'm all for building the incinerator because the waste needs to be disposed of, 
but without a full environmental impact report being conducted, we may not find 
out the ill effects of burning the estimated 22,500 tons of hazardous materials 
for decades.

SUPREME COURT ON CIVIL RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "A Giant Step Backward," editorial, June 8: 
</P>
<P>
We too are appalled at the Supreme Court ruling on discriminatory employment 
practices and share your concern. We especially endorse your closing sentence 
-- "Along with Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who dissented in the Wards Cove case, 
we are left to wonder 'whether the majority still believe that racial 
discrimination . . . is a problem in our society, or even remember that it ever 
was.' " 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial prompted me to write this letter and to suggest that if you are 
sincere in your concern about people forgetting what "civil rights" is all 
about, you might run a special anniversary feature article on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This 
historic legislation was won at the cost of great sacrifice and loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the Los Angeles League of Women Voters dedicated its annual Women of 
Honor luncheon to remembering this anniversary and honored civil rights 
activists Myrlie Evers and Marnesba T. Tackett. 
</P>
<P>
We were thrilled to have a large number of black men and women attending our 
luncheon and were very proud when our organization was applauded for presenting 
the only civil rights anniversary event in Los Angeles this year. 
</P>
<P>
The League felt this was an important anniversary to remember and hoped to get 
some recognition in The Times. However, beyond a "Save-the-Date" mention, and 
in the spite of sending a photo and press release by messenger the day after 
the event, we were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
This letter is not being written because our luncheon was ignored by The Times, 
but rather to urge you to use your powerful influence to help the community 
remember and protect all that was won by "blood, sweat and tears."

SUPREME COURT ON CIVIL RIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
As a retired college professor, who proudly participated in "the struggle to 
redeem us all from the dishonor of 200 years of racial (and ethnic) 
oppression," I salute The Times for standing up for equal opportunity for women 
and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, The Times does not throw out the "baby with the bathwater" by 
condemning all judicial activism. The court, like other branches of government, 
is not infallible. Surely the Dred Scott decision and the court's notorious 
"equal but separate" endorsement of school segregation show the court's ample 
capacity for error. But subsequent decisions also demonstrate the courage of 
wise justices to reverse previous errors! 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope the day is not far off when the court will realize that it took two 
"giant steps backward" when it struck down the apportionment of public works 
contracts to women and minorities, and then weakened the defenses of the same 
struggling people against discrimination!

SUCCESSES SHOW ABILITY TO TACKLE OTHER HOT SPOTS, WIDER ROLES

By CYRUS VANCE and BARRY BLECHMAN, Cyrus Vance, a member of the Palme 
Commission, was secretary of state in the Carter Administration. Barry Blechman 
helped to draft the commission's report. He is a former assistant director of 
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the broad sweep of international events, no development has been more 
important in the last two years than the considerable progress that has been 
made in resolving conflicts in the developing world. This is the conclusion of 
the Palme Commission, a group of 16 former heads of state, cabinet-level 
ministers and political leaders, chaired by Sweden's late Prime Minister Olof 
Palme, which met sporadically between 1980 and April of this year. 
</P>
<P>
At its final meeting, the commission noted that as late as 1986, there were 36 
armed conflicts around the globe, virtually all in developing regions. Because 
these wars occurred primarily in areas already debilitated by poverty and 
underdevelopment, the human suffering was extraordinary. An estimated 3 million 
to 5 million people died as a direct result of war; millions more have fled the 
fighting, seeking food, shelter, health care and escape from political 
persecution. Indeed, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees is aiding 13 
million people at present, an appalling figure and an odious index of the 
world's continuing inhumanity. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last two years, progress has been made toward the relief of this 
suffering. U.N. mediators have made possible a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, 
although not yet a peace settlement. They have also brought an end to the use 
of Soviet forces in Afghanistan, although not to the civil war in that country. 
U.S. mediation has led to the conclusion of agreements that could help to 
advance the cause of peace in Namibia and Angola. Other efforts by the United 
Nations and by regional leaders to mediate conflicts have met with varying 
degrees of success in Central America, the Western Sahara and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. forces will play a role in ensuring the peace in many of these situations, 
as they do already in the Middle East and several other regions. There are 
10,000 soldiers from 23 countries now serving in the "blue-helmet" force. They 
carry out two kinds of operations: U.N. peacekeepers impose themselves between 
contending forces to avert incidents that could flare into war, while unarmed 
U.N. observers monitor, report and mediate between local commanders in the 
field. At present, there are eight operations of each type under way, and the 
prospect of several more in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
The development of a more stable and peaceful international system requires 
greater attention to U.N. peacekeeping. Changes in U.N. procedures -- 
particularly a strengthening of the secretary-general's authority to monitor, 
report on and recommend actions concerning international conflicts -- could 
enable peacekeeping missions to be mounted in a more timely manner and carried 
out more effectively. Moreover, both the roles envisioned for these 
international military forces, and the resources available for them, could 
usefully be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, U.N. peacekeepers have been used to oversee cease-fires and 
other temporary means of ending armed conflicts. In the more peaceful climate 
that now exists, more wide-ranging functions can be envisioned: 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.N. forces could be used to oversee elections in situations such as 
Namibia's. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maritime peacekeeping forces could be established to ensure free passage 
through vital international waterways, like the Strait of Hormuz, in situations 
such as the recent hostilities in the Persian Gulf, and to maintain security in 
waters troubled by pirates, as in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In certain other types of situations, U.N. peacekeeping forces could be 
used to respond to international terrorists, as well as to protect mini-states 
from mercenaries and other external threats to their security. 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.N. experts and logistical capabilities could even be used to help contain 
the effects of ecological catastrophes that threaten neighboring states, 
particularly in nations that lack the resources or expertise to deal with such 
problems alone. 
</P>
<P>
Such an expansion of peacekeeping functions could not take place unless greater 
resources were made available to the U.N. organization. Indeed, resources 
limitations have already curbed peacekeeping operations. Because of fiscal 
constraints, for example, the size of the U.N. Transition Assistance Group in 
Namibia was reduced by nearly half and its start delayed. It does not require 
imagination to understand that problems currently threatening the peace 
arrangements in southern Africa are related to this ragged start. 
</P>
<P>
Military units in national armed forces, including the armed forces of the 
permanent members of the Security Council, that might be made available for 
peacekeeping should be earmarked now, before they are needed, along with the 
air- and sea-lift units that could move them to trouble spots in a timely 
fashion. Specialized equipment should be stockpiled, particularly seismic and 
acoustic sensors, communications gear and mobile radars, all of which could be 
helpful in monitoring disengagement zones. Industrialized nations might help 
developing states to train and equip their military forces for peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Financing peacekeeping operations has always been a problem, with various 
states at times refusing to pay their assessed contributions. At its last 
meeting, the Palme Commission proposed that a special peacekeeping fund be 
established and built up to a total of $2 billion over a few years. The fund 
would be financed on the basis of a general formula assessing U.N. members, 
with no one member expected to pay an excessive share. Voluntary contributions 
to the peacekeeping fund also would be encouraged, particularly from those 
states like Japan and West Germany that, as a matter of law or policy, do not 
participate directly in peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
The world is in the midst of a warming trend in international relations. Not 
only have East-West relations improved greatly, but there is at least 
diplomatic movement in virtually all troubled regions. Such trends come and go, 
however. The nations of the world must act now to take the concrete steps 
necessary to preserve and expand the progress which has recently been achieved.

NO PARENT IS SAFE FROM HEADLINE JUSTICE 
</P>

Liberties Union of Southern California.

<TEXT>
<P>
Being a parent in Los Angeles has become a dangerous occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state's 1988 Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, parents 
run the risk of facing arrest and criminal prosecution if their child becomes a 
suspect in a crime. The law states that parents can be charged criminally if 
they are believed to have either encouraged their child's criminal activity, or 
if they are found to have not done enough to keep their child on the straight 
path. It says that parents will be held criminally accountable if they do not 
exercise reasonable care, but does not define in any way just what "reasonable 
care" is. 
</P>
<P>
The law is so vague and subjective that no parent is safe from its reach. This 
legislation is simply another in a series of high-gloss, ineffective law 
enforcement solutions to the very real and serious problem of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago the Los Angeles city attorney's office, using the Street 
Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, filed criminal charges against Gloria 
Williams, a Los Angeles mother, claiming she had encouraged and participated in 
her teen-age son's alleged gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with photos seized from the family's album and a litany of accusations 
about her fitness as a parent, law enforcement officials took their evidence to 
the nation's press. There Williams became the subject of public scorn and 
ridicule. Without a trial and with, as it now turns out, a faulty investigation 
into her background, Williams was branded in the national media as a "gang 
mother" and an unfit parent. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed as if law enforcement, using this case for a publicity stunt, was 
enforcing a constitutionally suspect law to gain media attention. Now it 
appears that the city attorney and others in law enforcement have come to agree 
with those who criticized the arrest of Williams. Earlier this month all of the 
charges against her were dismissed. What still remains, however, is a highly 
charged political climate, fed by public officials who persistently seek 
"headline" solutions to serious social problems. 
</P>
<P>
Urban violence in Los Angeles will not be eliminated by prosecuting mothers who 
are unable to prevent their children from being caught up in the cycle of gang 
activity. The so-called "gang mother" law is just one example of politicians 
applying cosmetics to a critical problem at the expense of constitutional 
rights. Clearly, the frustration over an inability to control the spiraling 
syndrome of gangs, drugs and crime has driven public officials to desperate, 
often ill-conceived measures. 
</P>
<P>
Most parents -- just like Gloria Williams -- are hard-working people, trying 
their best to raise children in the face of often overwhelming social and 
economic pressures. What none of us needs is a law that imposes a duty to 
prevent youngsters from becoming criminals, but doesn't tell parents what to do 
or how to do it. Those who commit the crimes should be prosecuted, not others 
innocent of any wrong-doing. 
</P>
<P>
Strong law-enforcement measures are required to restore the safety of our 
communities. But to put parents at risk under a law such as the Street 
Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, which is applied arbitrarily against 
those who are poor or powerless, is unfair and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to promote the law as the long-awaited solution to urban crime, 
public officials admitted it was aimed directly at inner city parents -- many 
of them females supporting a household alone. Sadly, such logic flies in the 
faces of what we now know to be true -- that crime and drugs are problems in 
every community across the country, large and small, rural and urban alike. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles doesn't need more headline justice to whitewash ineffective and 
constitutionally indefensible laws. The city needs serious and reasoned 
solutions to problems that threaten the very fabric of society. The public must 
demand -- and deserves nothing less than -- a commitment from all of its 
leaders to find rational answers to the epidemic of gangs, drugs and crime that 
is now sweeping the country. To accomplish this, adequate resources must be 
allocated, instead of the investment of precious tax dollars in a 
public-relations campaign.

WHO MAKES HAY ON U.S. FARM SUBSIDIES?

It was a spectacle to make a Kansas senator blush. 
</P>
<P>
On April Fools' Day, a freighter laden with 20,000 tons of Turkish wheat docked 
in New Zealand, courtesy of the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey is not a big grain exporter. For some years it hasn't even been able to 
meet its own needs. But U.S. grain subsidies under the Export Enhancement 
Program (EEP) have enabled Turkey to buy cut-price wheat from the United States 
and sell its own wheat in American, and even Australian, export markets. 
</P>
<P>
The giant communist economies have capitalized the most on U.S. subsidies. 
Between January, 1987, and March, 1989, U.S. taxpayers gave $885 million in 
subsidies to traders who shipped 28.8 million metric tons of cut-price wheat to 
the Soviet Union and China. That's more than five times the military and 
security aid requested by the Administration for Central America in '88-'89 -- 
aid justified mostly on grounds that it was to stem communism. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress and the Reagan Administration struck a deal four years ago to 
introduce the program, its supporters insisted it would help farmers, bolster 
sagging exports and force the European Economic Community to abandon its own 
costly farm export-subsidy program. 
</P>
<P>
But evidence now shows that the U.S. program has wasted taxpayers' money, 
aggravated trade tensions and violated program guidelines issued by the 
Cabinet-level Economic Policy Council in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Under the $2.5-billion program, foreign buyers purchase U.S. commodities 
cheaper than Americans can. U.S. exporters can offer bargain rates because they 
receive free surplus commodities from the U.S. Commodity Credit Corp. In the 
three years to June, 1988, the big three grain traders reaped more than $1 
billion in government aid. Traders, not farmers, benefit directly from 
subsidies at the U.S. end. 
</P>
<P>
The program's boosters say all of this ignores the surge in U.S. wheat exports. 
While exports have risen, this is at the expense of fewer cash sales and, 
according to farm lobbies, reduced exports of grains not dependent on the 
program. A study of wheat exports by the Economic Research Service of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture in 1988 revealed that the grain would have moved 
without subsidies. Analysts pointed to a lower, more competitive wheat- loan 
rate, decreased exports by subsidy-battered allies and greater world demand. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme's proponents justify its retention on lofty international grounds, 
claiming that U.S. subsidies force the European Community to hoist its own 
export subsidy payments. Higher payments, they say, apply extra budgetary 
pressure on the community and increase the likelihood that Brussels will 
capitulate to ambitious U.S. demands for agricultural reform at the ongoing 
General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
While EEP has raised European Community subsidy costs for wheat by $538 million 
between 1985 and 1988, this amount is paltry in the context of the 
$23.3-billion budget of the organization's program supporting the modernization 
of agriculture and promotion of scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of forcing the European Community to agree to U.S. demands at GATT, the 
Export Enhancement Program has antagonized community officials and accelerated 
European exports of subsidized commodities. In 1988-89 the community was 
expected to be the No. 1 exporter of barley. The European share of the world 
wheat trade is expected to rise from 18.4% to an unprecedented 20%-21% for 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the implementation of the subsidy program by the Reagan 
Administration had nothing to do with helping farmers or achieving trade 
reform. In 1985, David Stockman, then-Office of Management and Budget director, 
desperate to secure enough Senate votes to pass a budget reconciliation bill, 
reportedly agreed to the demands of farm-state senators for an export subsidy 
program. The program's aims were considered only after the deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
Program guidelines continue to be flouted. When then-Agriculture Secretary John 
Block unveiled EEP on May 15, 1985, he declared that subsidies would be 
"continuously targeted" at the markets of subsidized countries. By 1988, there 
was scarcely a food-importing country that had not received subsidized U.S. 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, with stock inventories low, farm incomes buoyant and financial 
markets impatient for a sign that the Administration and Congress are capable 
of confronting the budget deficit, this program should be a sitting target. It 
hasn't sunk because congressmen love trafficking in farm subsidies to help 
their reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Internationally, export subsidies erode U.S. credibility and leadership. Other 
nations find it galling to listen to America preach the virtues of free trade 
while Congress and the Administration unleash every subsidy program imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. industries are hoping for international trade reform, but such reform 
is foundering on the issue of farm subsidies and bruising encounters between 
America and its allies. At the very least Congress and the Administration 
should signal their commitment to agricultural trade reform by jointly 
announcing their intention to abolish the Export Enhancement Program and freeze 
other export subsidy programs for the duration of the GATT round.

<P>
As far as the Boston Red Sox were concerned, they played two games Tuesday 
night -- one against Nolan Ryan and another against the Texas Rangers' bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do anything against Nolan, then we looked out there and suddenly he 
was gone," Nick Esasky said after Boston rallied with six runs in the eighth 
inning and beat the Texas Rangers, 6-3, at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan gave up four hits and struck out six in seven innings. After throwing 115 
pitches, the 42-year-old right-hander left with a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a great job, but he said he had had enough," Texas Manager Bobby 
Valentine said. "A shutout for seven innings, you can't ask for anything more 
than that. He knew what he had to do, and the other guys knew what they had to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
But Kenny Rogers and Jeff Russell (3-2) gave up four hits in the eighth and 
errors by second baseman Julio Franco and shortstop Scott Fletcher led to an 
unearned run. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers walked Jody Reed to start the eighth. One out later, Wade Boggs doubled. 
Russell then relieved and Greenwell doubled to pull Boston to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
After Dwight Evans walked, Esasky tripled in two runs and scored when Franco's 
throw to third sailed wide, making the score 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 8, Milwaukee 2 -- Bo Jackson hit his 17th homer of the season in a 
six-run 11th inning as the Royals beat the Brewers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Boone opened the 11th with a double off Mark Knudson (2-3), and 
pinch-runner Rey Palacios scored the go-ahead run on Frank White's single. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Seitzer walked and George Brett hit a two-run double before Jackson 
homered to center field for a 7-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Eisenreich singled, went to second when Pat Tabler walked and scored on 
Palacios' single to make the score 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gordon (9-2) gave up the tying run in the eighth before pitching two 
scoreless innings. Steve Farr pitched a perfect 11th. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 7, Cleveland 4 -- Jim Dwyer had his first four-hit game in six years 
as the Twins defeated the Indians at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Anderson (8-4) gave up six hits in 7 1/3 innings, struck out one and 
walked one, and Jeff Reardon finished for his 13th save. He relieved with a 4-2 
lead and runners on first and third, got Joe Carter on a pop-up and Pete 
O'Brien on a fly. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Candiotti (7-5) saw his nine-game home winning streak end. Candiotti, who 
last lost in Cleveland Stadium on June 9, 1988, is 14-3 at home since the start 
of the 1988 season. He gave up four runs and 10 hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 1-1 in the third, Dan Gladden singled and Kirby Puckett walked. 
Dwyer singled in Gladden with the go-ahead run and, one out later, Randy Bush 
hit a two-run double to make the score 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Dwyer, who singled in the ninth for his fourth hit, had not had a four-hit game 
since July 17, 1983, against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 13, New York 6 -- Dan Pasqua and Harold Baines each hit three-run 
homers and had four RBIs and 40-year-old Jerry Reuss won his fifth consecutive 
decision as the White Sox defeated the Yankees at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox had 17 hits, three each by Dave Gallagher and Ivan Calderon, who 
tripled, singled, and doubled in his first three at-bats. Pasqua suffered a 
bruised left elbow in the third inning when he collided with catcher Don 
Slaught while trying to score and was removed as a precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
Reuss, who celebrated his 40th birthday Monday, overcame a three-run first 
inning to improve to 7-2 and win his 218th career game. He gave up eight hits 
in five innings, striking out one and walking one. 
</P>
<P>
John Davis, purchased from Vancouver on Monday, worked the last four innings to 
earn his first save, giving up Slaught's second homer and Rickey Henderson's 
RBI single in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 6, Detroit 4 -- The Athletics ended a season-high four-game losing 
streak as pinch-hitter Terry Steinbach's home run broke a sixth-inning tie at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire's three-run homer tied the game in the third as the A's ended 
their longest losing streak since July 5-7 of last season. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire led off the sixth with a double off reliever Brad Havens (0-1) and 
Steinbach connected one out later for his fourth homer and the first by an A's 
pinch-hitter since last June 19. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 30,184 pushed Oakland's season attendance over the one million mark 
after 33 home dates, the earliest in the team's history. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 8, Seattle 6 -- Mike Devereaux drove in three runs as the Orioles 
overcame a five-run deficit and beat the Mariners at Seattle for their fifth 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle scored five runs in the first inning to knock out starter Jeff Ballard, 
who got only one batter out. But Baltimore scored one run in the third, three 
in the fourth and four in the fifth to take an 8-5 lead.

Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. : The company, largest single-family home 
builder in California and third largest in France, said second-quarter net 
income was up 74% to $19.9 million. Revenue was down 14.5% to $246 million. The 
company said the decrease is attributable to the fact that 1988 revenue 
included about $100 million from the sale of Atlantique Montparnasse, a 
commercial complex to be developed in France. The improved earnings were 
attributed to both the strong California and French housing markets and to a 
continued emphasis on improving margins and quality control.

DOCTOR WHO RENEGED ON PROMISE MUST PAY $400,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former San Diego doctor who welshed on a $73,657 federal scholarship must now 
repay the government more than $400,000, a federal judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Gordon Thompson Jr. of the U.S. District Court in San Diego entered a 
summary judgment against physician Gary Dean Hatcher, a former Santee resident 
who has moved to Modesto. Hatcher could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher received the four-year medical school scholarship in 1980 in exchange 
for his promise to practice in an area with a shortage of physicians for four 
years after graduation. But he balked when the National Health Service Corps 
(NHSC) assigned him to Texas rather than to the California locations he 
preferred, court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, the government may collect treble damages for NHSC 
scholarship defaults. Since Hatcher must also repay the interest on the 
original scholarship, his total liability exceeds $400,000, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert H. Plaxico. 
</P>
<P>
Plaxico, who prosecuted the case, said he hopes the judgment deters other 
doctors in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"If Dr. Hatcher had served his four years, he would not have owed the 
government a penny, but no, he chose not to, and so the penalties are entirely 
appropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher argued in court that the NHSC discriminated against him by sending him 
information about potential assignments late. But Thompson blamed Hatcher for 
the confusion which led to the delay. Furthermore, " . . . it was made clear to 
Hatcher from the beginning that he had no guaranteed right to placement in the 
location of his choice," Thompson wrote in his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in an attempt to settle the suit, the NHSC offered Hatcher a choice 
of assignments if he would agree to serve out his obligation, according to 
Catherine A. Strohlein, head of the U.S. attorney's debt-collection unit. But 
Hatcher refused, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After the NHSC determines the precise amount of damages, Hatcher will have 60 
days to appeal the decision, Strohlein said. 
</P>
<P>
But eventually, he will have to pay, Plaxico said. "It's a simple matter of an 
individual not being willing to return a quid pro quo."

An overwhelming number of San Diegans believe that drug- and gang-related crime 
has reached crisis proportions here, but most of them are not ready to raise 
taxes to hire more police -- and, in fact, have doubts that additional police 
would solve the problem, a Times poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
With the San Diego City Council scheduled to begin debate Thursday on more than 
$20 million in deep, wide-ranging budget cuts aimed at putting 140 new police 
officers on the streets by next year, the poll found that San Diegans share the 
council's concern over crime, but question its proposed solution. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the poll reveals that most San Diegans apparently do not share 
the council's confidence that hiring more officers will put a serious dent in 
crime and that they have strong misgivings about the proposed tax increases and 
budget cuts needed to expand the police force. San Diegans might be willing, 
however, to pay a new trash collection fee to help underwrite the police 
hirings, the poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Hirings Questioned 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans agreed 81% to 16% that drug- and gang-related crime has reached an 
emergency level here, with 66% saying they believe that local crime has 
worsened over the past year. Twenty-three percent said they or a member of 
their immediate families have been crime victims within the past year. 
</P>
<P>
But only 16% of those polled said that hiring more police officers is the best 
means of reducing crime, less than half as many who cited drug education 
programs in schools and tougher sentencing by courts as more effective methods. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if the council goes ahead with its plan to hire more police, there is 
no clear public consensus over how best to finance that expansion, the poll 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans are closely divided -- 49% to 43% -- over increasing property taxes 
to increase the size of the police force -- far less than the required 
two-thirds margin that would be needed for approval if the issue appears on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
There also is less than majority support for the $21.8 million in budget cuts 
proposed by City Manager John Lockwood as a means of freeing the dollars needed 
to hire the 140 new police officers next year. However, if budget cuts are to 
be made, the ones that would least trouble San Diegans are funding for the 
arts, followed by brush and weed cleanup programs and delays in park 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans are favorably inclined, the poll shows, toward another possible 
method of financing police hirings: establishing a $7.50-a-month trash 
collection fee for single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$22.4 Million Next Year 
</P>
<P>
Although a 1919 voter-approved proposition guarantees free trash collection to 
single-family homes, 52% of those polled said they either support or are 
leaning toward approval of a monthly fee. If the so-called "People's Ordinance" 
were repealed, Lockwood's office estimates that it would raise $22.4 million 
during the next fiscal year -- money that then could be used to hire more 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday of 770 people 
throughout the city of San Diego. The poll's margin of sampling error is plus 
or minus 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Many questions in the poll detected a distinct ambivalence between San Diegans' 
perceptions of the extent of the crime problem and their feelings about how to 
combat it, especially monetarily. 
</P>
<P>
For example, given the choice between raising taxes or cutting existing 
services in order to expand the force, the poll found San Diegans leaning in 
favor of higher taxes -- 49% to 45%, a difference that falls within the poll's 
margin of sampling error. 
</P>
<P>
"While people acknowledge there's a serious problem, they haven't gotten to the 
point where they've figured out a dollars-and-cents answer to it," said I. A. 
Lewis, director of the Times poll. "The solutions they like are the ones that 
seem to be the least costly, and the budget cuts they'd go along with are the 
kind that would least affect them." 
</P>
<P>
As the council turns its attention to the limited financial options available 
to hire more police, the poll sends mixed political signals to City Hall. In 
short, that message is: We think you've identified a significant problem, but 
are skeptical of your solution and are even more doubtful about your ideas of 
paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Emergency' Action Backed 
</P>
<P>
In addition to San Diegans' 81% agreement that crime has reached emergency 
levels, the poll also showed nearly 3-1 support for Mayor Maureen O'Connor's 
recent request that Gov. George Deukmejian declare a state of emergency over 
the situation -- a plea officially rejected by Deukmejian on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three percent of those polled said they believe that the mayor's and City 
Council's request for $103 million in state and federal aid to fight crime 
stemmed from a legitimate crisis, while only 22% viewed the incident as a 
publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
As to how best to reduce the crime problem, drug-education programs and tougher 
sentencing by judges were the top two suggestions; they were named by 45% and 
44% of those polled, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, only 16% felt that hiring more police would be the best solution 
to the problem, followed by jobs programs for youths (13%), drug treatment 
programs (12%) and gang diversion programs (10%). Only 8% saw the construction 
of additional jails as the best answer. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, however, said Tuesday that she does not consider that apparently 
lukewarm public support for hiring more officers to be inconsistent with the 
council's determination to do so. Increases in police staffing, she said, will 
enable antidrug programs that now reach only about half the city's schools to 
encompass the entire school system. 
</P>
<P>
"By hiring more police, we can send officers to the classrooms, where they can 
provide the kind of drug education people believe is necessary," O'Connor said. 
"Doing one thing will allow us to do the other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Whether but How 
</P>
<P>
Unless the council reverses the direction in which it has been heading, the 
budget actions taken over the coming weeks will be driven primarily by the 
members' desire to accomplish their oft-stated goal of hiring more police -- an 
objective that admittedly can be achieved only at the expense of other city 
programs. Indeed, the dialogue at City Hall already has largely moved beyond 
the question of whether to hire more police, focusing instead on how to fund 
that expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson, who has sharply taken issue with Lockwood's 
proposed budget cuts -- which would postpone planned improvements at Mission 
Bay Park in Henderson's 6th District -- argued Tuesday that it is "not too late 
to redirect the debate." 
</P>
<P>
"The people are absolutely right in believing that hiring more police isn't the 
answer," said Henderson, who has recommended that the city delay hiring 
additional officers and building police substations in order to instead build a 
city jail for misdemeanor suspects. Henderson's suggestion could be in line 
with the poll's finding of strong support for tougher sentencing by courts, an 
action that could require additional jails. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we talk about this, I hope my colleagues will see that the crisis 
isn't that we don't have enough officers -- it's that we have 8,000 to 10,000 
criminals on the streets who we can't get in jails," Henderson said. "I'm 
convinced that (other council members') feet are not set in concrete on this 
140-officer plan . . . especially now that we've seen what the manager says 
we'd have to cut to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The budget cuts proposed by Lockwood are designed to raise the $36 million 
needed over the next two years to hire the 140 extra officers and build two new 
substations. Lockwood has proposed a $21.8-million cut in recreation, social 
service and other programs over the next two years, as well as $14.9 million in 
reductions in capital improvement projects to fund construction of two 
substations. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans appear unenthusiastic about most of those proposed cuts, the poll 
shows. When asked which cuts they favor the most, they placed arts funding at 
the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unenviable Position 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two percent of those polled said they favor reductions in arts funding -- 
putting the arts in the unenviable position of finishing ahead, by a 3-2 
margin, of the next-closest service categories earmarked for possible cuts. 
Twenty-eight percent said they would support elimination of the city's weed and 
brush cleanup programs, while 27% favored reducing the Mission Bay Park 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Youth after-school recreation programs and social services are the areas that 
San Diegans feel deserve the most protection from budget cuts, being named by 
only 8% and 9%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't think it should be necessary to make these cuts," O'Connor said. 
"Their feeling is, 'We've already paid our taxes to Sacramento and Washington. 
Why can't that money get back here to make local neighborhoods safer?' They 
can't understand why that doesn't happen, and neither do I. The poll reinforces 
that strong sentiment that's out there." 
</P>
<P>
The plan to hire 140 new police officers is part of a longer-range program to 
add 440 officers to meet the city's overriding goal of raising manpower levels 
from the current 1.62 officers per 1,000 residents to 2 officers per 1,000. For 
that long-term program -- intended to lower police response times -- to be 
economically feasible, both budget cuts and tax increases probably would be 
needed to offset the estimated annual costs of $50 million produced by the 
higher police staffing levels, city administrators concede. 
</P>
<P>
Under one proposal, property taxes would be increased $69 per every $100,000 of 
assessed valuation to pay for the Police Department's higher budget. While 49% 
of those polled support that proposal, contrasted with 43% who oppose it, that 
is far short of the required two-thirds margin. 
</P>
<P>
There is slightly stronger support, however, for a proposal to create the 
garbage collection fee. San Diegans agreed, 52% to 42%, that they would support 
such a fee to raise funds to hire more police. Repeal of the 1919 ordinance 
would require only a simple majority vote at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saying, Doing Are Different 
</P>
<P>
However, when people leaning in either direction on the trash fee question are 
excluded, the result is more evenly balanced. Among those who feel strongly 
about the fee, 41% favor it and 39% oppose it. Raising another factor that 
clouds the issue's likelihood of passage, Times pollster Lewis noted: "Usually, 
more people say they'll vote for something that's going to cost them money than 
actually do vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, crime victims or their relatives -- making up 23% of the 
poll's total sample -- felt somewhat stronger about the crime problem and the 
need to hire more police than those whose lives have not been touched by crime. 
For example, 85% of the victims described the crime problem as an emergency, 
contrasted with 81% among non-victims. Similarly, 74% of the victims said that 
local crime has worsened over the past year, a suggestion that drew agreement 
from 63% of the non-victims. 
</P>
<P>
In general, low-income San Diegans believe to a greater extent than high-income 
individuals that crime has reached emergency levels, and older people are more 
concerned than younger people about the problem. However, wealthier people are 
more willing to raise taxes to hire more police -- perhaps because they can 
more easily afford to do so than can poorer families, whose lives typically are 
more directly affected by crime.

MUSEUM IS STILL LOOKING FOR ITS SPOT IN THE SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a sort of Smithsonian of surfing. 
</P>
<P>
Jammed with ancient surfboards and old photographs of the greats, the 
California Surfing Museum in Encinitas is quickly becoming something of a 
fixture along the San Diego County coast. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening its doors nearly a year ago in a donated suite in a new coastal 
shopping complex, the museum has played host to more than 2,000 visitors, 
organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to maintain a fresh approach to the past, the museum's all-volunteer 
staff is preparing for a barbecue Saturday to kick off a new six-month 
exhibition of old wooden boards and photographs, many of them never before on 
public display. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plank From the 1900s 
</P>
<P>
"For the real history fan, we've got some great stuff," said Jane Schmauss, a 
museum organizer and owner of George's restaurant, an Encinitas eatery that 
often displays the historic boards. "We've got a plank that has to date to the 
1900s." 
</P>
<P>
As yet, however, the institution's board of directors has been unable to land a 
permanent home for the surf museum. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still surfing and still dreaming," said Stuart Resor, a local architect 
and the organization's president. "It will probably be several years before 
we're settled for good. But that could change if we get booted out of the place 
we are. We're real comfortable there now, so the pressure's not on. Like anyone 
else, we'll react to the pressure when we have to move." 
</P>
<P>
Resor said he still hopes the museum can attract someone willing to donate a 
historic home that could be moved to an appropriate site near the water, 
perhaps near the public parking lot at Moonlight Beach in Encinitas. He noted 
that several older homes are being eyed for removal in the Mid-City section of 
San Diego to make room for an extension of Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone has an old house we can use, that would be great," Resor said. 
"It'd be even better if it has real high ceilings. One old fiberglass board we 
have from the Mission Beach Plunge is about 18 feet long." 
</P>
<P>
While the hunt for a permanent home continues, the outfit has made itself 
comfortable in a back suite in Moonlight Plaza, a shopping center completed a 
year ago near Encinitas Boulevard and the Coast Highway. Paul Rotschek, 
developer of the plaza, donated the space to the nonprofit museum for the cost 
of utilities and taxes, Resor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continued the Hunt 
</P>
<P>
Although the group had a sizable stock of artifacts from surfing's golden years 
in hand even before setting up shop in the plaza, the museum staff has 
continued to hunt down interesting and rare items in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those will be on display during the upcoming exhibition, dubbed "Iron 
Men and Wooden Boards." Surfboards dating mostly from the 1920s to the '50s 
will be featured, some of them made of redwood and balsa. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, black-and-white stills from the 1940s by longtime surf 
photographer Doc Ball, one of the first shutterbugs ever to venture into the 
water to capture the art of riding waves, will be displayed. Vintage motion 
picture footage of old-time surfers will also be shown throughout the afternoon 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"This exhibit will have some truly classic old wooden boards," Resor said. 
"People will be able to see them and touch them to really get a feel for where 
surfing came from and how far it's gone since that era." 
</P>
<P>
The barbecue kicks off at 3 p.m. and lasts until 6, but visitors can still get 
a peek at the various artifacts in the coming months because the museum is open 
all day on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
As always, Resor said, the organization is eager for surfing buffs to donate 
old boards or other relics of bygone days. As a tax-exempt outfit, the museum 
can grant write-offs for equipment that might otherwise fetch a few bucks at a 
garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is there are lots of interesting surf artifacts literally 
rotting away in people's attics, under the porch or in the garage, old pictures 
of old-time surfers in people's scrap books, that sort of stuff," Resor said. 
"It would be great to have it. . . . There must be some surfers out there 
somewhere who need a tax deduction."

TEACHER'S SUIT CLAIMS SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teacher who claims she was relieved of her coaching duties after she fended 
off the sexual advances of the principal at the school where she formerly 
taught has filed a $4-million lawsuit against him and the Oceanside Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed last week by Karyl Ketchum accuses Jefferson Junior High School 
Principal Michael Walker of sexual harassment and discrimination. Ketchum is 
seeking $3 million from Walker in connection with alleged unwelcomed advances 
against her at a school event in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Besides naming Walker, 42, the lawsuit also seeks $1 million from the Oceanside 
Unified School District for failing to both conduct a proper investigation of 
Ketchum's complaints and take disciplinary actions against Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Armstrong, a school district spokesman, said Tuesday that he had not 
received a copy of the lawsuit and declined to comment. But Armstrong insisted 
that the school conducted a thorough and professional investigation of the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, "Walker assaulted and battered (Ketchum) by grabbing her 
from behind on the right buttock, with such force and vehemence that bruises 
and physical marks of abuse resulted." 
</P>
<P>
Ketchum, 34, claims the incident occurred within full view of students and 
adults attending an intramural basketball game between faculty and students. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, the academic year ended shortly after the incident and, 
upon returning to school in September, Ketchum was abruptly informed -- without 
any explanation from Walker -- that she had been relieved of all her coaching 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Ketchum was a tenured teacher who -- in addition to serving as 
chairwoman of the school's science department -- coached basketball, 
cross-country and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Ketchum said she notified district administrators of the problems, but claims 
that the district's investigation was conducted in bad faith. The suit alleges 
that the investigator was, and continues to be, a friend of Walker, thus 
creating a conflict of interest. She also alleges that promises of 
confidentiality offered during the investigation were broken repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong declined to comment on the investigation's findings but denied that 
it was conducted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
"It grieves me to see a member of the district at least seemingly infer that 
the district office would be less than professional about checking out such 
grievances," Armstrong said. "It went to the appropriate administrator and a 
thoroughly professional job was done. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation was reviewed by the district and an attempt was made to 
reach an amicable resolution with the teacher," Armstrong said. "Unfortunately 
that could not be done." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said he did not know whether any disciplinary action has been taken 
against Walker, the principal at Jefferson Junior High since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the June 15 incident, Ketchum claims that Walker sexually harassed her 
by kissing and embracing her on two other occasions. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the strained working environment, Ketchum left Jefferson in 
February and now works as a temporary physical education teacher at elementary 
schools in the Oceanside district. 
</P>
<P>
Walker could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

FALLBROOK DEVELOPER DRAWS FIRE WITH PITCH FOR PROPOSED LANDFILL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Efforts by Fallbrook developer David Lowry to add his 1,600-acre site to the 
three finalists under consideration by San Diego County as a North County 
landfill brought out a full house of protesters at Tuesday's Board of 
Supervisors session. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors delayed a decision on Lowry's proposal until July 5 to determine 
whether Lowry, a former chairman of the Fallbrook Planning Group, violated 
county policies by voting against another proposed Fallbrook-area dump site 
while having an interest in a competing site. 
</P>
<P>
Lowry was quick to respond that he had begun his search for an alternative site 
after leaving the Fallbrook planners, announcing at the time he left that he 
would attempt to find an alternative to a proposed Rainbow-area site that 
Fallbrook residents opposed. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would send documented proof to the county counsel's office showing 
the time schedule of his land acquisitions after his resignation from the 
county-sponsored Fallbrook planners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Opposition from Fallbrook 
</P>
<P>
However, Lowry's proposed dump site four miles east of Interstate 15 and south 
of California 76 brought more opposition from Fallbrook than did the Rainbow 
site to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairwoman Susan Golding was kept busy gaveling the unruly audience to 
silence as catcalls, cheers and applause followed each speaker who spoke for or 
against the proposal to place Lowry's Couser Canyon site in contention with the 
three finalists. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents criticized the site as too small, able to contain North County 
residents' trash for only four or five years, and too environmentally risky 
because it is in the San Luis Rey River Valley, where contamination could 
pollute wells and water supplies downstream. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents condemned the Lowry proposal as the first step in the 
destruction of the bucolic valley. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook resident Davis Roach charged that Lowry's proposal was "conceived in 
dishonesty and a betrayal of the public trust," because Lowry, while chairman 
of the Fallbrook Planning Group, had lobbied against and voted against the 
Rainbow-area site while he was accumulating property for a competing landfill 
site in Couser Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Played Fair' 
</P>
<P>
Lowry "has not played fair with either Fallbrook or the county," Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
Lowry said his property dealings were above board and conducted after his 
resignation from the Fallbrook group. He said he will present proof of that to 
the county counsel's office, which was ordered by the board Tuesday to 
investigate the conflict of interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
Lowry, speaking to reporters after the hearing, confirmed that he had taken 
options on most of the Couser Canyon land and had acquired some of the property 
outright. But, he stressed, he did not begin the acquisition while he was a 
member of the planning group. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had obtained financing for the venture from Waste Management Inc., 
one of the world's largest disposal firms, but that this did not guarantee that 
the county would hire the firm to manage the dump site if it is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Also protesting the inclusion of the Lowry site among the finalists were Valley 
Center planners and members of Indian bands in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pledged to Pay for Analysis 
</P>
<P>
Lowry had asked that his site, which earlier had been rejected by the county as 
too small, be included among the sites to undergo intensive environmental 
review. He pledged to pay for the environmental analysis for his site if 
supervisors allow it to be included among the finalists. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John MacDonald said he was "very disturbed" over the charges that 
Lowry had violated county conflict of interest regulations and made the motion 
to delay the decision on the site until the matter was investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Brian Bilbray also was accused of impropriety in the Lowry site 
issue by opponents who painted Bilbray as a close friend and political 
associate of Lowry. Bilbray denied any close relationship with Lowry. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray spoke in favor of including the Lowry site in the final selection 
process, pointing out that it was more accessible than others under 
consideration, "closer to the areas that generate the waste," and therefore 
worthy of consideration despite its smaller size. 
</P>
<P>
The three finalists in the North County landfill site selection process are 
Blue Canyon northwest of Warner Springs, Trujillo Canyon north of Pala and the 
Aspen Road (Rainbow) site between Fallbrook and Rainbow.

PHOENIX HOUSE STILL MAY OPEN DRUG CENTER, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney representing Phoenix House said Tuesday that there is still a 
chance that the nonprofit corporation will proceed with plans to open a drug 
treatment center in Lake View Terrace, confirming neighbors' suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation isn't certain yet. . . . There is still a possibility we would 
continue with that site," said attorney Chris D. Ozeroff after the Los Angeles 
Board of Zoning Appeals granted a nine-week postponement of a hearing involving 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Ozeroff's statement contradicted assurances made three weeks ago by a spokesman 
for the nonprofit corporation soon after former First Lady Nancy Reagan 
withdrew from the project. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, spokesman Chris Polanco said Phoenix House would abandon the 
former Lake View Terrace Medical Center site and look for one Mrs. Reagan 
deemed more suitable. Mrs. Reagan had said through her spokesman that 
neighborhood opposition persuaded her to pull out of the 210-bed center and 
research and training institute -- scheduled to be named the Nancy Reagan 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Active Opposition 
</P>
<P>
"The battle is still on," said Lynne Cooper, president of the Lake View Terrace 
Improvement Assn., which has actively opposed the center for more than a year. 
"I never trusted Phoenix House after our first meeting with them, so there's no 
reason to start now." 
</P>
<P>
The first indication that Phoenix House officials might have reconsidered their 
stance surfaced Friday, when they requested a 30-day extension from a scheduled 
June 27 hearing appealing a zoning administrator's ruling in favor of the site. 
On Tuesday, Ozeroff -- an attorney with the active City Hall lobbying firm of 
Latham &amp; Watkins -- asked that that extension be doubled, and the board 
granted a nine-week postponement. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys need time to determine whether the $5.3 million in money and pledges 
raised for the center during the past year is legally tied to the Lake View 
Terrace location or can be transferred to another site, Ozeroff confirmed. 
Phoenix House officials have estimated that it would take $10 million to $11 
million to buy and renovate the bankrupt hospital's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The $5.3 million was raised at several celebrity-studded events attended by 
Mrs. Reagan. So far, Mrs. Reagan has not committed to lending her name to 
another Phoenix House site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Effort 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Marx, who has headed fund raising as national campaign chairwoman for 
the Nancy Reagan Center, said Mrs. Reagan wants the money to go toward her 
"Just Say No" to drugs effort either at a center or elsewhere. When donors have 
asked about center plans, Marx said she tells them: "I'm dedicated to helping 
Nancy Reagan keep kids away from drugs. . . . We're going forward with our work 
because the young people need it so much." 
</P>
<P>
Lake View Terrace residents who attended Tuesday's Board of Zoning Appeals 
hearing had mixed reactions to Ozeroff's comments and the hearing postponement. 
They have said consistently that they fear such a center will attract drugs and 
crime and lower their property values. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Zimmer, a member of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn., delivered a 
written statement to the board that said that without Mrs. Reagan's backing 
"the proposed use for the site will obviously be substantially altered" and, 
therefore, Phoenix House should be required to begin the city permit process 
again with a new application. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lewis Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., 
said his conversation with another Latham &amp; Watkins attorney reassured him 
that the delay would not mean a resurrection of center plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Won't Happen' 
</P>
<P>
"The project is dead. It won't happen," Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
Snow had supported the hearing's postponement, with the stipulation that 
Phoenix House promise not to continue with plans at the Lake View Terrace site. 
Ozeroff said the corporation could not agree to such a stipulation because it 
needs to keep its options open. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of Mrs. Reagan's announcement, Phoenix House officials notified the 
Bankruptcy Court-appointed trustee who controls Lake View Medical Center of 
their intent to cancel the purchase option. But that withdrawal is not yet 
official because it has not been reviewed by a federal bankruptcy judge.

$275-MILLION INITIATIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARITA ROAD TAX OKD FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to place a tax 
initiative on the November ballot that could raise up to $275 million for roads 
in the Santa Clarita Valley over the next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Just three weeks ago, proponents of the measure said it would never reach the 
Nov. 7 ballot because Santa Clarita and Los Angeles County officials were still 
drafting the complex documents needed to create the agency that would 
administer the funds. Proponents predicted that a special election would have 
to be held in December. 
</P>
<P>
But to their surprise, planners and attorneys hammered out details of the 
proposal in time, said Lou Garasi, head of a citizens transportation committee 
spearheading the effort. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, which must be approved by two-thirds of the voters, would add from $75 
to $200 to annual property tax bills. The tax would be levied on most property 
within the William S. Hart Union High School District, but would not include 
the rural town of Val Verde and small portions of the city of Los Angeles 
located within the Hart district. Senior citizens would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the supervisors voted to create a joint-powers agency with Santa 
Clarita to oversee the funds. While the agency's board must now hold a public 
hearing to set the boundaries of the tax district, that step is viewed as a 
formality, Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors appointed Dave Vannatta, planning deputy to Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich, and county Planning Director Jim Hartl to the agency's board. Santa 
Clarita Mayor Jan Heidt and Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon will represent 
the city. The four will select a Santa Clarita Valley resident as the fifth 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the measure conceded that persuading voters to tax themselves 
will not be easy. "The sale of this is going to be tough," said J. J. O'Brien, 
a member of the citizens committee. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Brien and others said Santa Clarita's crushing traffic problems could 
persuade voters to support the tax.

COUNCIL UPHOLDS LIMITS ON DUMPING AT LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a second setback for the operators of Sunshine Canyon Landfill, a Los 
Angeles City Council committee Tuesday upheld a previous decision to severely 
limit the amount of dumping at the site after 1989. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council's Planning and Environment Committee left open the 
possibility that Browning-Ferris Industries, the dump owner, will be able to 
obtain several deadline extensions if the company agrees to comply with other 
orders handed down in December, 1988, by the city's Board of Zoning Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Browning-Ferris said they will appeal the committee's decision to 
the full City Council, regardless of potential deadline extensions. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, the Board of Zoning Appeals found Browning-Ferris in 
violation of several conditions set forth in its 1966 zoning variance. The 
owners were ordered to eliminate the landfill's dust and litter problems, 
obtain a permit to allow the 1,724-foot-tall dump to exceed its limit of about 
1,700 feet and cease dumping near an access road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Capacity 
</P>
<P>
The board also decided that the main southern dumping area -- now a landfill 
mesa one-third of a mile from homes in Granada Hills -- has reached capacity 
and should be closed Dec. 31. That would leave the landfill with only a small 
area for dumping, reducing the amount of garbage it could receive by 90%. 
</P>
<P>
The firm had urged the committee to delay its decision for six months or more 
until operators obtained necessary permits to expand the landfill into a 
northern, more remote canyon. The company sought the extension so full-scale 
landfill operations would not be interrupted by the Dec. 31 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys said it would be unwise to sharply limit the 7,000 tons a day of 
trash -- 15% of all refuse in Los Angeles County -- that the dump receives. 
</P>
<P>
Without use of the main dumping area, the landfill's operators have said, the 
site would be filled to capacity by 1991, forcing it to close. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initiated Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the Planning Committee, initiated the 
investigation of the dump in his North Valley district. Bernson said that he is 
willing to work with the firm but that he "can't waive the rules when we have a 
problem here." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would be willing to extend the Dec. 31 date by "30 or 60 days" if 
the company could show that it was making good-faith efforts to comply with 
Board of Zoning Appeals rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills residents, who have long complained about the dump's odor, dust 
and litter, said they were pleased with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that the committee upheld the ruling rather than buckle 
under the tremendous pressure on it from landfill representatives," resident 
Mary Edwards said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: N. HOLLYWOOD YOUTH FATALLY SHOT IN PACOIMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood teen-ager died Tuesday after a possibly gang-related shooting 
at a Pacoima housing project, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old youth, whose name was not released pending notification of his 
family, was found at 12:30 a.m. in the intersection of Carl Street and Carl 
Place in the San Fernando Gardens housing complex, Detective Al Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who had been shot in the upper body, was taken to Pacifica Hospital 
of the Valley, where he died a short time later. Ferrand said that police knew 
of no motive for the attack, but that the intersection where the youth was 
found is a hangout for Pacoima gang members. 
</P>
<P>
He said that detectives were attempting to find witnesses to the shooting and 
that there were no suspects.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 29-year-old Encino woman was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years to life in prison 
for killing her boyfriend during an argument about the woman's female lover. 
</P>
<P>
Adele Kathy Rodriguez pleaded guilty earlier this month in Van Nuys Superior 
Court to second-degree murder after admitting that she strangled Stanley 
Wittman, 68, with a shoulder strap from a pair of overalls. The victim's 
decomposed body was found Sept. 15, 1988, by the building manager in the 
couple's apartment in the 5400 block of Newcastle Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been arguing about Rodriguez's romantic involvement with another 
woman, Nancy Ortiz, at the time of the slaying, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A week after the killing, police said they discovered Ortiz driving the 
victim's 1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass when she was stopped for a traffic violation. 
Ortiz told police that Rodriguez admitted to her that she had killed Wittman. 
Rodriguez was arrested a short time later, authorities said.

GIBSON STRIKEOUT HELPS SLAM DOOR ON 2-0 VICTORY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eighth-inning confrontation between Kirk Gibson and Bruce Hurst was between 
more than a multimillion-dollar hitter and multimillion-dollar pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
This was between former American League East rivals from old, gritty cities, 
rivals who had come west to make a fresh start in a new league. They had faced 
each before and they knew each other well. 
</P>
<P>
They squared off Tuesday night for the first time in their new surroundings 
with a game in the balance, and the tension was as dramatic as the result. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst retired Gibson on a called third strike to end a Dodger threat and 
preserve a 2-0 Padre victory in front of 25,746 at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great pitch," Gibson said. "There is not a person on the face of the 
Earth who would not be surprised by that pitch." 
</P>
<P>
The pitch was a curveball, the first and only one Hurst threw to Gibson in four 
at-bats. It was a pitch Hurst said he had used successfully against Gibson when 
Gibson was in his early days in Detroit, and Hurst was starting out in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a pitch he said he seldom used against Gibson anymore. Hurst said 
Gibson had wised up and learned how to hit his curve. So Hurst saved it until 
he needed it most -- full count, two out, runners on first and third and the 
Padres leading, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't thrown him a breaking ball all day long," Hurst said. "I figured it 
was now or never." 
</P>
<P>
The strikeout ended a battle of wits and nerves that began after Hurst allowed 
his only extra-base hit -- a two-out double to Jose Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph followed with an infield single on a grounder that shortstop 
Garry Templeton was hard pressed to prevent from going into left field and 
possibly scoring Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Gibson, a .346 hitter against Hurst as a Tiger. Hurst started Gibson 
with three balls before he answered with three called strikes -- the last on a 
curveball that had Gibson pulling back slightly from the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The strikeout was Hurst's sixth and last of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"To me that was the game," Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson said. "It came down 
to a three-two curveball. And that was the pitch he didn't expect." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst's troubles were not over; he had to pitch out of another two-out jam in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher singled and went to third when third baseman Luis Salazar let 
Rick Dempsey's grounder get down the left-field line for a two-base error. But 
Hurst retired Alfredo Griffin on a fly to right to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
The shutout was Hurst's first in the National League and his first since Aug. 
7, when he defeated Detroit, 3-0, while a member of the Red Sox. It extended 
Hurst's streak of scoreless innings to 19 over two games. 
</P>
<P>
The complete game was his third as a Padre, his first since a 3-1 victory at 
Pittsburgh April 26. But the victory was Hurst's first in four starts, since a 
1-0 decision over Philadelphia May 29. That was the midpoint of a seven-game 
stretch in which Hurst also lost three times and had three no-decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst pitched well in most of the games. In the seven games, he allowed 14 
earned runs in 48 2/3 innings for a 2.59 ERA. Only once, when he gave up six 
earned runs in the first five innings of a 12-2 loss at San Francisco June 9, 
did Hurst allow more than three earned runs in any of those starts. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was lack of support. The Padres scored 17 runs in those seven 
games, an average of 2.4 runs per game. Those troubles reached their zenith 
Thursday against Cincinnati when Hurst left for a pinch-hitter in the 11th 
inning of a scoreless tie. The Padres won, 1-0, in the 12th, but Hurst did not 
figure in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres did not offer much more support this time, but what they did provide 
was enough on a night when Hurst was at his best. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres took a 1-0 lead in the third. Tony Gwynn led off with a walk and 
moved to second on Jack Clark's groundout to shortstop. Marvell Wynne popped 
out to first, but Templeton came through with a double to right, scoring Gwynn, 
and he took third when Hatcher dropped the ball for the an error. He was left 
stranded when Benito Santiago grounded to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres added a run in the fourth for a 2-0 lead off starter Tim Belcher. 
Salazar opened with a single, and Shawn Abner walked with one out. Belcher's 
wild pitch advanced the runners to second and third before Salazar came home on 
Roberto Alomar's sacrifice fly to left. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough to chase Belcher, who left for a pinch-hitter in the fifth and 
was replaced by John Wetteland. Belcher (4-6) took the loss, his fourth in his 
past five starts. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had other chances against Belcher but fell victim to some old bad 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
They loaded the bases with one out in the first on a single by Alomar and walks 
to Gwynn and Clark. But they came away empty as Wynne fouled out and Templeton 
struck out. 
</P>
<P>
A similar scene was repeated in the second inning when Salazar singled with one 
out and, after Hurst struck out attempting a sacrifice bunt, Abner singled to 
put runners at first and third. 
</P>
<P>
That scoring chance was wasted, too, when Alomar flew out to center to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
It was another example of the Padres' inability to take advantage of early 
opportunities -- two innings, no runs, five left on base. 
</P>
<P>
And while they would go on to leave a total of eight runners stranded, they 
scored enough to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We did some things well when we had to," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. 
"Maybe our luck is about to change." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn took over as the leading hitter in the National League this week, 
but do not expect him to do a lot of box score watching -- at least not yet. 
"It's too early," Gwynn said. "I don't worry about that until September. Too 
many things can happen between now and then." Gwynn entered the game with a 
.358 average, just ahead of second-place Barry Larkin (.355) of Cincinnati. 
Gwynn has been on a hot streak, batting .474 (36 for 76) in 20 games before 
Tuesday night's game against the Dodgers. While Gwynn is hitting, his 
base-stealing has fallen off of late. On May 25, Gwynn stole his 19th base to 
lead the National League. He went 21 games until his next stolen base Saturday 
against Houston and entered Tuesday night's game with 21, third in the league. 
Gwynn said he has curtailed his running at the request of Manager Jack McKeon. 
"I was taking too many chances," said Gwynn, who has been caught stealing eight 
times. "I still have a green light, but now it's a shaded green light. I have 
to be more selective. I have to go when the time is right." 
</P>
<P>
Today's starting pitcher, Ed Whitson, will be out to break a two-game losing 
streak after having won a personal-best seven in a row. The Padres, who scored 
50 runs for Whitson in eight starts (seven victories, one no-decision), have 
scored a total of one in the two losses. . . . Andy Benes, the first player 
selected in the 1988 amateur free-agent draft, remains on the disabled list at 
double-A Wichita with tendinitis in his pitching arm. He was placed on the 
seven-day disabled list June 9, but no date has been set for his return. . . . 
Ray McDavid, the outfielder from Clairemont High School who was drafted by the 
Padres during the amateur free-agent draft June 5-7, has not signed a contract 
but has agreed to terms, director of scouting Randy Smith said. After McDavid 
signs, he will be assigned to the Padres' Scottsdale team in the Arizona Rookie 
League. The Padres other San Diego County selection, left-handed pitcher Scott 
Vonderleith, has not agreed to terms. Vonderleith has attended Mesa College and 
Mission Bay High School.

SAN DIEGO STATE SUSPENDS TRACK AND FIELD PROGRAM 
</P>

Citing increased budget problems within the athletic department, San Diego 
State Athletic Director Fred Miller announced Tuesday the indefinite suspension 
of men's and women's track and field. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who made the announcement at SDSU's football operations center, said 
the athletic department needed to make "cost-containing moves" because of a 
budget deficit that has now reached $577,000. 
</P>
<P>
The cutting of track and field would save about $225,000 on the 1989-90 budget, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
After dropping track, SDSU needed to add another women's sport to meet the NCAA 
requirements for remaining a Division I program, and Miller also announced the 
addition of women's soccer. SDSU now has 15 sports, eight men's and seven 
women's. 
</P>
<P>
Women's soccer, which will offer no scholarships initially, will cost around 
$5,000 because it is already a club sport that generates its own income. Chuck 
Clegg, the men's soccer coach, will serve as director of soccer, overseeing men 
and women. 
</P>
<P>
"We take no pride in this kind of announcement," Miller said. "Other 
universities are in the same situation. We're no different than anyone's family 
budget, where we've spent more than we've taken in." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said revenue from football was down about $190,000 from projected 
figures because of sluggish attendance stemming from the poor records of the 
past two seasons. Men's basketball revenue was $85,000 above projections, but 
it was not enough to save track. 
</P>
<P>
"We only have two income generators, football and (men's) basketball. Those 
programs have to succeed. And we have to make sure those programs succeed," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Cerveny, director of men's and women's track and field, said Miller 
notified him of the school's action around 5 p.m. Monday, and the two met 
Tuesday morning to discuss the situation further. Cerveny accepted the news but 
refused to see it as the end of track at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult to accept," Cerveny said. "But we knew we had to make some 
budget cuts. Dr. Miller has been very positive all the way. I really believe he 
didn't want to cut the program. Our program was the easiest solution to the 
budgetary needs." 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "I don't want the rug to be pulled. Cut my budget, but let me run 
a program." He said he could run the program with $150,000 and will try to 
revive it through donations. 
</P>
<P>
He said that $50,000 of that budget is set aside for scholarships and grants, 
which the school has agreed to honor next season anyway. Of the remaining 
$100,000 needed, Cerveny said he already has $20,000 committed ($10,000 from 
the athletic department and $5,000 each from the budgets of men's soccer team 
and men's volleyball) and has set a Aug. 1 deadline to raise the additional 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure that we're not ready to quit. We're survivors." 
</P>
<P>
The track program consisted of approximately 90 athletes (this year's roster 
listed 57 men and 32 women) and four coaches, including Cerveny, who has been 
at SDSU for eight years after coaching highly successful Morse High teams from 
1974 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, SDSU received $225,000 in grants from the state for improvements to 
Choc Sportsman Track, a state-of-the-art, multi-event facility. The 
improvements have been completed, and the improved facility was scheduled as 
the site of the Western Athletic Conference championships in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said SDSU will honor all track scholarships and grants next year if the 
athlete chooses to remain at the school. Those wishing to transfer will be 
permitted to compete immediately for a new school under the NCAA rules of 
transfering from a canceled program. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the program puts the futures of many of its participants in 
doubt. At least one of its best athletes thinks he will have no choice but to 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pat Thiss, a junior hammer thrower who finished 14th at the NCAA 
championships this month, "I don't know why they cut our program. The women's 
basketball team is in mid-scandal. They just fired the coach. They're paying 
Denny Stolz to coach golf. Why do they cut us? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't cause problems. We never cause problems. We win. We send athletes to 
the nationals. Fred Miller dropped a bomb on us. He really did a number on us. 
That's 90 athletes who have really had a monkey wrench thrown into their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
Thiss said he will wait before deciding whether to transfer. But he made it 
clear that if track is not reinstated, he will leave. "I'm on schedule to 
graduate. Transfering to another school would really put me back. But I would 
have to transfer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cerveny, who is also the men's and women's cross-country coach, said the school 
will keep him for the fall cross-country season, but his status is uncertain 
after Feb. 1, 1990.

DIGEST: CS NORTHRIDGE SIGNS DOW FOR SOFTBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
De Dow, a former Canoga Park High and Moorpark College softball standout, has 
signed a letter of intent to play for Cal State Northridge, Matador Coach Gary 
Torgeson announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will be the third college Dow has attended since graduating from 
Canoga Park in 1986. She first enrolled at Cal Lutheran but decided not to play 
there and transferred to Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
In two seasons at Moorpark, Dow won a school-record 48 games, including 30 last 
season when she earned junior college All-American honors and led Moorpark to 
third place in the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Dello, an outfielder from Pierce College, has signed a letter of intent to 
play baseball at St. Mary's in Moraga, Calif. Dello batted .350 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Evie Barry, a middle-distance runner from San Jose Santa Teresa High, and Cindy 
Byrne, a hurdler from Canyon High, have signed letters of intent to attend Cal 
State Northridge in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Barry placed sixth in the 1,600 in the state championships. She has personal 
bests of 2 minutes, 13.9 seconds in the 800 and 4:58.83 in the 1,600. Byrne won 
the Southern Section 4-A Division title in the 300-meter low hurdles as a 
junior but was unable to defend the title because she was academically 
ineligible. She has bests of 43.47 in the 300 hurdles and 14.8 in the 100 
hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hill of Simi Valley High has been selected to the All-Southern Section 
5-A baseball team sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles. 
Only 13 players were selected to the first team. 
</P>
<P>
Included on the 4-A team are Hart's Casey Burrill and Lance Migita, Notre 
Dame's Chris Lohman and Rio Mesa's Dmitri Young.

VACANT CLEVELAND JOB DRAWS MANY INQUIRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calls to the principal's office at Cleveland High came in a steady stream just 
one day after basketball Coach Bob Braswell announced that he was leaving the 
school to become an assistant at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ida Mae Windham, Cleveland's principal, said the list of prospects was growing 
fast Tuesday afternoon, and Braswell predicted that she would receive "100 more 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Greentree, who guided Marshall High to the City Section 3-A Division 
championship three years ago, was among the first to inquire about the vacant 
position, Braswell said. Others reportedly interested are Washington High Coach 
David Spirlin, Canoga Park Coach Jeff Davis and Calabasas High assistant Wayne 
Fluker. 
</P>
<P>
Fluker, a former Cal State Northridge graduate assistant, said he believes that 
the chances are "pretty good" that he will succeed Braswell, his friend of five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"At least in his mind, I'm the No. 1 candidate," Fluker said, referring to 
Braswell. "Bobby knows the type of person that program needs. I'm sure his word 
will influence her decision heavily." 
</P>
<P>
Fluker was selected as basketball coach at Monroe High earlier this year but 
was unable to accept the position because he had not secured a teaching 
credential. Since then, he has received certification and has been teaching 
physical education and health at Agoura High and coaching the junior varsity at 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell is an English teacher, so a position is open in that department. 
However, there are no openings for a P. E. instructor. Windham said that she is 
working without a timetable for hiring a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District requires one-fourth of each school's 
faculty to be composed of minorities, complicating Windham's task. Braswell, 
who is black, said that the school is not currently in compliance with the 
district guideline. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever his successor is, Braswell is confident of one thing: Cleveland's 
winning ways will continue, with guards Eddie Hill and Andre Chevalier and 
forward Bobby McRae returning to form a solid nucleus next season. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever comes in should win 12 games, easy," he said. "You could put a dead 
body on the bench and win 12 or 13 times with these guys." 
</P>

DAVE DISTEL: EVEN PADRE FANS HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO BE THANKFUL ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, so the Padres are not exactly in the thick of contention. So they have been 
treading water as if they have weights on their ankles and Jaws trimming their 
toenails. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some things to like about the way things are going for the Padres 
in this summer of such high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brown does not play for them. 
</P>
<P>
My understanding is that Brown, recently released by the Detroit Tigers, has 
caught on with the Medicare Muffins. However, he is on the disabled list with a 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Moreland does not play for them. 
</P>
<P>
Moreland, the other half of the trade that brought Walt Terrell from the 
Tigers, is still in Detroit. However, he will likely return to San Diego when 
he retires, presumably to either run for mayor or host a talk show, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 They own Orel Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
This guy has not beaten the local heroes yet this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Abner owns Cy Young Award winners. 
</P>
<P>
This puppy took a big bite out of the Bulldog when he hit that three-run homer 
Monday night. He also hit a home run off Dwight Gooden, another Cy Young Award 
winner, on May 16, 1988. Unfortunately, he hit none in between. Fortunately, 
Steve Bedrosian is coming to town with San Francisco this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Rose is not the manager. 
</P>
<P>
He never will be. Bet on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Clark plays for them. 
</P>
<P>
Clark is going to earn his keep many times over in concession income. Look at 
it this way: Through the first 71 games, Clark either struck out or walked 
51.8% of the times he went to the plate. Consequently, knowledgeable fans are 
shrewdly making their food and drink trips during Clark's turns at bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris "Bore Me" Berman is not on the broadcast team. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never heard a broadcaster get so much attention for being so completely 
inane. Not insane . . . inane. Insane can be fun, right Ted? 
</P>
<P>
 Jack McKeon's dexterity. 
</P>
<P>
Was that really Jack McKeon with both feet off the ground jumping into umpire 
John McSherry's face Friday night? You watch Trader Jack shuffle around, and 
you think there is no way he could jump over a base line. Yet, there he was, 
jumping and jawing and eventually getting himself a free trip to an early 
cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 No games are scheduled in Houston until Sept. 6 ... and only two games that 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
The dome of doom certainly did it to the Padres their last trip in. If they do 
not get untracked and get back into this race, the downward turning point in 
the season will be blowing those three- and four-run leads in the ninth inning 
during that recent trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito Santiago is catching for them. 
</P>
<P>
Benny may grouse and pout over real or imagined slights, but no one ever dozes 
off when he is behind the plate and a runner has the audacity to take an 
adventurous lead off base. How many of them have turned around with looks on 
their faces like they are tightrope walkers and they realize the rope is coming 
untied? 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Parent is catching for them. 
</P>
<P>
This understudy could be a star. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Alomar Jr. is catching in the farm system. 
</P>
<P>
Junior must feel like a monarch's youngest son, so near to the throne but so 
far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Boggs is not playing with them. 
</P>
<P>
I've outgrown circuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Chandler is in the broadcast booth. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler's the other guy. He did not win any World Series rings during the 
Casey Stengel era in New York. He did not get drafted No. 1 in the nation and 
then save an American flag. He is not the guy who annually finishes first 
hereabouts in most loved and most hated polls. Chandler's the guy with the 
gravelly voice who simply lets you know what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Bip Roberts is happy. 
</P>
<P>
It seems like only yesterday, but it was three years ago that Leon Roberts came 
to San Diego all brash and cocky and then disappeared like a blip from a radar 
screen. He is back now and comfortable with a utility role. He can play just 
about anywhere, steal a base and ranks among the National League leaders in 
triples in spite of his limited playing time. He can become the Tim Flannery of 
the '90s, a Mr. Popularity who smiles his way through a productive career. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn plays for them. 
</P>
<P>
If I'm the owner, I sign this guy to a $30 million contract for 10 years and 
know I'm going to get my money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Kroc owns this team. 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, I'm not the owner because I would have a problem trying to cover a 
$30 million contract with kickbacks from the grocery money. It would be good 
business for Ms. Kroc because Tony would probably agree to kick back maybe $10 
million in quarter-pounders. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, all is not totally rosy for the Padres. They could use a Kevin M., either 
of the two they traded. They could use a left-handed hitter with clout, 
preferably a third baseman. They could use a bit more fire. Most of all, they 
could use the right kind of out when they have a runner on third base and less 
that two out. 
</P>
<P>
Enough of this. 
</P>
<P>
One last thought that may be good . . . or may be bad. 
</P>
<P>
There are 90 games to play.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: GIRLS' SOCCER STAR FROM LA PUENTE SELECTS USIU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kim White, an All-CIF Southern Section girls' soccer player from Bishop Amat 
High School in La Puente, has signed a national letter of intent with U.S. 
International University. The defender led Bishop Amat to four consecutive 
section tournaments and played for the state champion under-19 team. 
</P>
<P>
White is the second state select player to sign with USIU, joining Lisa 
Ferragamo of Agoura. Larry Draluck will be in his first season as USIU coach 
this coming fall.

YACHTING 
</P>
<P>
High winds and rough seas have forced two of the 11 yachts competing in the 
second San Diego to Honolulu Double Handed Traspac race to bow out. 
</P>
<P>
Breathless, raced by Scott and Shannon Davy of Carlsbad, and Kairos, out of 
Northridge, both lost their masts early Monday morning and are returning to San 
Diego. Winds reached more than 30 knots, with seas of eight to 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Major Tom, sailed by Eric Bohman and Kevin Miller of Ventura, held a slight 
lead over Stinger, sailed by Terry Lingenfelder and Mike Casinelli of the San 
Diego Yacht Club. The first yachts are expected to finish on or about July 1. 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Brent Noon of Fallbrook High School will compete against Randy Barnes, the 
world indoor record holder and silver medalist at the 1988 Olympics, and Jim 
Doehring of Fallbrook, the runner-up to Barnes at the recent U.S. track 
championships, in the Jack in the Box Invitational at UCLA's Drake Stadium Aug. 
6. 
</P>
<P>
Noon is the 1989 national high school leader with a put of 69-8 1/2 but will 
have to use the 16-pound shot instead of the 12-pounder that is used in high 
school meets.

An announcement by the black American pop group the Commodores that they will 
perform in South Africa next month drew criticism Tuesday in Johannesburg where 
black South African artists vowed to do everything legally possible to stop the 
event. The Commodores are scheduled to appear in Bophuthatswana for seven 
performances starting July 7, despite a U.N.-led cultural boycott to protest 
South Africa's apartheid policies. Members of the all-black U.S. recording 
group acknowledged that their decision made them a target of the anti-apartheid 
movement and possible blacklisting but pledged to criticize apartheid while in 
South Africa. The South African Musicians Alliance, in turn, said the 
Commodores are "an embarrassment to our cause" and failed to consult with 
"democratic structures inside and outside South Africa" about their 
plans.ALEENE MacMINN

U.S. Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.) said Tuesday he will offer legislation to block 
federal grants to a North Carolina arts agency that supported a controversial 
photograph featuring a crucifix immersed in the photographer's urine. Under the 
Yates amendment to a National Endowment for the Arts funding bill, the NEA 
would be required to make its grants directly to artists, a change in endowment 
procedures that would affect 200 of the NEA's 4,500 annual grants with an 
estimated value of $15 million. The change in procedure, a Yates spokesman 
said, is intended to prevent a recurrence of a controversy in which 
conservative senators and congressmen have demanded action against the 
endowment because of its indirect support of the photographer who produced the 
crucifix-urine image. The work, by New York photographer Andres Serrano, was 
selected for inclusion in a traveling show that received partial NEA funding 
and was organized by the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, a North 
Carolina agency that receives about $75,000 a year from the endowment. ALEENE

MOTOWN MOVER AND SHAKER TAKES STAGE AT FAIR TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With the average price of a concert ticket these days somewhere around $20, the 
Del Mar Fair's grandstand concert series is indeed a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
The $5 cost of getting into the fair includes free admission to the 15,000-seat 
grandstand, where a cavalcade of big-name pop stars performs each night, and 
most afternoons, through July 4. 
</P>
<P>
If you haven't yet taken advantage of this great deal, tonight's the night to 
do so. Appearing on the grandstand stage at 7:30 will be Smokey Robinson, 
perhaps the most successful, and certainly the most influential, member of the 
Motown Records family of 1960s rhythm-and-blues hit makers. 
</P>
<P>
Since Robinson's 1960 recording of "Shop Around" (with the Miracles) became the 
Detroit label's first national hit, his name has been synonymous with the 
much-ballyhooed "Motown sound" that dominated the charts for much of the 
ensuing decade. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's delicate falsetto helped the Miracles score more than two dozen 
other big hits, including "You've Really Got a Hold on Me," "The Tracks of My 
Tears," "I Second That Emotion" and "The Tears of a Clown." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he also penned hits for a bevy of other Motown artists, among 
them Mary Wells ("My Guy"), the Temptations ("My Girl"), Marvin Gaye ("Ain't 
That Peculiar") and the Marvelettes ("Don't Mess With Bill"). 
</P>
<P>
Robinson left the Miracles in 1972 to pursue a solo career and take on 
additional duties as vice president of Motown Records. He continued to be a 
popular concert attraction, but his record sales fluctuated; he resumed his hit 
streak with 1979's "Cruisin' " and has periodically topped the charts ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's impact on pop music goes beyond the Motown sound. Over the years, 
his tunes have been recorded by a diverse range of artists, including the 
Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson and Linda Ronstadt. Prince copied his 
trademark falsetto with much success; contemporary soul balladeers such as 
Jeffrey Osborne and Billy Ocean acknowledge Robinson as one of their role 
models. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder, then, that Smokey Robinson was recently inducted into the Rock 'n' 
Roll Hall of Fame, joining such previous honorees as Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly 
and Ray Charles. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Cindy Lee Berryhill wrote her first song -- a mournful epitaph to 
dinosaurs called "Cretaceous Times" -- as a precocious 10-year-old living in 
rural Ramona, she has consistently gone where no other neo-hippie 
folksinger-songwriter has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of proselytizing about peace, love and save-the- planet existentialism 
a la everyone from Joni Mitchell to the horrid Edie Brickell, Berryhill takes 
herself, and the world around her, a lot less seriously. 
</P>
<P>
She's an observer rather than a preacher, and, since she's not standing behind 
a pulpit, she's free to wander around and, well, wonder, like the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
And on "Naked Movie Star," her just-released second album on the nationally 
distributed Rhino Records label, she observes and wonders about everything from 
bums and hookers to past selves and trees. Her lyrics reflect the ponderous 
innocence of a childlike Weltanschauung steeped in a certain amount of 
fatalism; accordingly, her voice is at once girlish and wizened. 
</P>
<P>
On "Trump," she refuses to indict megabuck New York slumlord Donald Trump; 
instead, she merely observes, and lets Trump indict himself: "I'll take 
Manhattan/If I could fatten up my salary/Soon there won't be any poverty/As far 
as I'm concerned/This great big town is a utopian dream/Just made for a man of 
means." 
</P>
<P>
And on "12 Dollar Motel," Berryhill paints a stark portrait of the hooker life 
style: "12-dollar motel, Room 99/The mirror is cracked, that suits you 
fine/There's a broom in the corner throwing darts at the moon/There's a pink 
and green halo encircles the room/ . . . Ain't nothing here hip 'cept the hand 
on the pelvis/And the lady's red lip." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: A July 12 release date has been announced by MCA/Curb Records for 
"Poor and Famous," the fourth album by San Diego roots rockers the Beat 
Farmers. The album will include a newly recorded version of singer-guitarist 
Joey Harris' "Hideaway," which he wrote more than a decade ago while touring 
with veteran folkie John Stewart. Earlier this year, producers of the current 
hit movie "Major League" heard a two-track demo of the song and liked it so 
much that they put it on the film's sound track LP. 
</P>
<P>
Suffering from stress and exhaustion, legendary rock balladeer Gene Pitney has 
canceled all upcoming concert appearances for the next three weeks, including 
Friday night's show at Humphrey's on Shelter Island. Promoter Kenny Weissberg 
said he hopes to reschedule the show later this summer, just as he's done for 
the Natalie Cole show, which was to take place May 12 but is now on tap for 
Sept. 7 (May 12 tickets will be honored). . . . Just added to the Humphrey's 
lineup: Phoebe Snow, Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Limbo Slam is the first San Diego band to release a CD-only album, "Tropical 
Funk." The group will be playing, and debuting its album, tonight at the Belly 
Up Tavern in Solana Beach. . . . Exactly 21 years ago Thursday, local pop group 
Gary Puckett and the Union Gap hit the charts with what was to become their 
third million-selling single, "Lady Willpower."

Chuck Morris, formerly with Cameo, Chaka Khan and most recently saxophonist 
Paul Russo, has been hired to replace Terri Lyne Carrington as the drummer on 
"The Arsenio Hall Show." Carrington gave up her lucrative position -- union 
scale for musicians on a TV show is approximately $1,350 per week -- to promote 
her debut recording, "Real Life Story" (Verve/Forecast), which has been one of 
the Top 5 contemporary jazz albums on the Billboard magazine charts for several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted to leave the show occasionally and go on the road in support of her 
album," said Hall musical director Michael Wolff. "But this band isn't set up 
that way. It's not like 'The Tonight Show.' You can't have subs." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff picked Morris, saying, "We decided to go with a sleeper, a sort of 
unknown guy who could really commit to being in the band. He's from the South, 
and he plays like a New Orleans drummer, with a great back-beat feel." 
</P>
<P>
Carrington could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
MOUNTAINS TRUST BENEFIT: The vocal quartet Manhattan Transfer, altoist Richie 
Cole, singer Kenny Rankin, composer Robert Kraft and groups featuring 
guitarists Wayne Johnson, Jorge Strunz and Ardeshire Farah are all donating 
their services this Friday at the Wiltern Theatre in a benefit for Mountains 
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
"Mountains Trust is a land trust which owns and protects land in the Santa 
Monica mountains," said concert producer Michael Skoletsky, "and the proceeds 
from this concert will go toward purchasing additional acreage." Since its 
inception in 1981, the trust has accumulated 1,200 acres which has either been 
donated to the National Park Service -- the organization donated 200 acres last 
March -- or kept as preserves. One of the latter is the Cold Creek Canyon 
Preserve near Malibu, which is open to the public on a reservation basis. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the benefit are $25, or $125 for gold circle, which includes a 
pre-performance party with the artists. Information: (213) 456-5625, 308-5005. 
</P>
<P>
BANDS ON THE AIR: Big bands from Eagle Rock, Hamilton, San Fernando and 
Washington high schools will be seen on "Jazz Festival/89," a half-hour TV show 
that airs on KCLS (Channel 58). "The bands were selected by judges Ndugu 
Chancler and John Deichman from 10 semifinalists, who were screened from the 
many Los Angeles Unified School District school bands that sent in audition 
tapes," said Ralph Jungheim, who produced the event in conjunction with 
Performing Tree Inc. and the school district. The program, taped in April at 
the Musicians Union on Vine Street in Hollywood, will be hosted by saxophonist 
Gerald Albright (Locke High School class of 1975) and will air Saturday at 2:30 
p.m., Wednesday, 8:30 p.m. and July 2 at 10:30 a.m. Information: (213) 
625-6958. 
</P>
<P>
Jungheim -- who has produced about a dozen LPs, including Joe Williams' 1985 
Grammy-winning "Nothin' But the Blues" (Delos) -- was in New York last week, 
overseeing a new LP by singer Ruth Brown, who won a 1989 Tony Award as best 
leading actress in a musical ("Black and Blue"). "It was a blues date," said 
Jungheim -- who produced Brown's last LP, "Have a Good Time" (Fantasy) -- "and 
it was terrific." No title has been set for the session, which featured 
saxophonist Red Holloway, keyboardist Bobby Forrester and guitarist Rodney 
Jones and is due out in August, also on Fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ FOR THE SINGLE SET: You've heard of "The Love Connection," now check out 
the Jazz Connection, an occasional series of events where jazz fans can gather, 
hear some good sounds and, as promoter-musician Gordon Halligan put it, 
"hopefully meet new people who like jazz and have similar interests." Halligan 
started the Jazz Connection last year and has been holding events steadily 
since December, either in private homes or at the Le Mondrian Hotel, where his 
next concert, featuring his own band, will be Saturday. The party runs from 
7:30 p.m. until midnight, costs $20, and includes free valet parking, free 
appetizers and a no-host bar. Information: (213) 662-3639.

ELDER GALLO BROTHERS WIN BITTER TRADEMARK LAWSUIT 
</P>

<P>
Ernest and Julio Gallo retained exclusive control of their family's trademark 
name when a federal judge in Fresno on Tuesday ordered the wine makers' younger 
brother, Joseph Gallo, to stop using his own name on a brand of cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Ending a rancorous, insult-trading public dispute among members of the normally 
publicity-shy Gallo clan, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle said in his 
61-page order that the younger Gallo actively and unfairly schemed to exploit 
the valuable name recognition his brothers had cultivated over the last 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the legal battle, the wine-making Gallos accused their brother 
of running a rat-infested cheese plant; lawyers for Joseph Gallo, the cheese 
maker, countered with accusations that his brothers made cheap wine to sell to 
drunks. 
</P>
<P>
The judge brushed aside the argument that Joseph Gallo has the right to his own 
name as a trademark, noting that because of his own misleading advertising 
"there is substantial evidence of actual confusion" among both retailers and 
consumers who thought the wines and cheeses were made by the same company. 
</P>
<P>
Critical to the case were some notes made by a Joseph Gallo Farms marketing 
strategist, which the judge said confirmed the cheese maker's determination "to 
capitalize on the Gallo name and image" -- an image cultured with $300 million 
worth of advertising over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Even without that argument, the judge said, the wine-making Gallos had taken 
great care to develop a unique image, one they should not have to forsake only 
because theirs is a relatively common Italian name. 
</P>
<P>
"If every person named Gallo were entitled to use Gallo as a consumer 
trademark, Gallo might be adopted as a trademark on any imaginable product," 
the judge wrote. "Such proliferation of uses would destroy the unique nature of 
the Gallo brand, its distinctiveness and its commercial value." 
</P>
<P>
Coyle's order, filed Monday and made public Tuesday, gives the Joseph Gallo 
Cattle Co. of Livingston, Calif., 30 days to cease using "Joseph Gallo" as a 
trademark for its cheeses. However, his order lets the company use the name in 
less conspicuous type as long as a new brand name or logo is used as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Jury 
</P>
<P>
The judge spent six months preparing the legal opinion after presiding over a 
monthlong trial in Fresno that ended just before Christmas last year. There was 
no jury in the case because the older Gallos did not seek monetary damages -- 
only an order stopping their brother from using the family name. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Gallo, who was rebuffed in September in a related legal effort to claim 
a one-third share in the winery started by his older brothers, declined to 
comment on the ruling. The 69-year-old rancher's lawyer, Denis Rice of San 
Francisco, said he will advise his client to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The reclusive Ernest and Julio Gallo, 80 and 79 years old, also had no comment 
on the ruling. However, they insisted from the start that their lawsuit was 
filed without malice to protect their trademark and the company, Consolidated 
Foods, that is licensed to make Gallo-brand salami in cooperation with the 
winery. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, their company -- E &amp; J Gallo Winery of Modesto, Calif., 
by far the world's largest wine maker -- issued a two-sentence statement: "The 
court has ruled in our favor, after extensive review of all the facts and law 
in the case. We are pleased the matter has been brought to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, relations among the brothers was not so decorous. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Gallos said they had offered their brother a royalty-free license to 
use the family name if only he would allow regular inspections of his plant by 
the winery -- just as the other licensee was checked. But Joseph refused, so 
his brothers produced an expert trial witness who characterized Joseph Gallo's 
cheese operation as shoddy and rodent-infested. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Gallo fired back by threatening to sue Ernest for slander, while his 
lawyers used their own experts to shoot down the tainted-cheese innuendo. They 
also challenged the quality of some of Ernest and Julio's wines, including the 
cheap, fortified "Thunderbird" and "Night Train" brands said to be favored by 
many street drunks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father Killed Mother 
</P>
<P>
Such rancor was not always the way with the Gallos. After their father shot and 
killed their mother and then took his own life in 1933, the elder brothers 
raised Joseph themselves while starting up their wine-making empire with grapes 
from the family vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
When Joseph was old enough, he became vineyard manager. He held the job for 18 
years before striking off on his own as a grape grower and dairy cattleman not 
far away. He still sells wine grapes to his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Joseph Gallo expanded his dairy operation and built a cheese 
plant near Atwater, Calif. After a year of selling bulk cheese to other 
packagers, he began marketing his own Joseph Gallo brand Cheddar and Monterey 
jack cheeses. Cheese sales reached $30 million a year by 1987. 
</P>
<P>
That success proved problematical when Joseph Gallo's cheese making appeared to 
be infringing on the expensive and exclusive cheese-making license his elder 
brothers had sold to another firm much earlier. When terse, tense negotiations 
failed, Ernest and Julio Gallo sued in April of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Gallo countersued four months later, asserting that his parents intended 
for him to share equally in the family vineyards that later grew into the 
billion-dollar-a-year winery. U.S. District Judge Edward Dean Price dismissed 
the suit, wryly noting that the best witness, the brothers' late father, "was 
out of reach of the court's process."

BUSH ORDERS A CUT IN CHINA CONTACTS, WILL OPPOSE LOANS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush cut off most high-level contacts between the United States and 
the Chinese government Tuesday and ordered action to block China's access to 
loans from international financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The new measures, a break from the Administration's strategy of using 
diplomatic pressure rather than sanctions against the Chinese, were imposed to 
protest the death sentences given to 11 protesters for attacking soldiers or 
vehicles during pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing and Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials hope that the tactic will prompt Chinese leaders to 
pull back from widespread arrests and prosecutions of protesters and perhaps 
head off executions. 
</P>
<P>
"The President felt it was necessary to send a strong signal of unhappiness 
with the arrests and death sentences," said a White House official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The White House chose the punitive actions from a series of possible responses, 
pulling up well short of tough economic sanctions or a break in diplomatic 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
A White House official said that, within the next six months, China is expected 
to apply for $1.4 billion in loans from the World Bank and international 
development banks. In addition, China has applied for $230 million in loans for 
a power plant and for agricultural development. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States succeeds in stalling consideration of the loan 
applications, the move could block China's access to crucial international 
financing needed for its struggling economy. Already, the World Bank has begun 
to freeze loans that were pending for China totaling roughly $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the halt in high-level contacts, White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said: "This action is being taken in response to the wave of violence 
and reprisals by the Chinese authorities against those who have called for 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopeful Tone Retained 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the hopeful tone of previous statements, he emphasized that the United 
States recognizes the importance of China and hopes "to continue productive 
relations." The suspension of top-level diplomatic exchanges does not include 
recalling U.S. Ambassador James R. Lilley from Beijing. Bush has argued that 
such a step would be counterproductive because it would block U.S. access to 
information about developments in China. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate impact of the decision would be to cancel a trip to China 
scheduled for next month by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. Over time, 
a halt in contacts between Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials and their Chinese 
counterparts would impede progress in U.S.-Chinese relations and would be 
likely to curb Chinese access to U.S. goods and financing. 
</P>
<P>
A White House official said that, while no specific terms were set for lifting 
the suspension, it would require "a lessening of tensions and a return to more 
normal standards" in China. 
</P>
<P>
With the United States expressing growing concern about the death sentences, 
Chinese Ambassador Han Xu was summoned to the State Department on Monday 
evening to hear the U.S. protest about the sentences and to receive a plea for 
clemency from William Clarke, acting assistant secretary of state for Asia. The 
ambassador said that he would relay the Administration's concerns to Beijing, 
an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sentences of death in Shanghai and Beijing could only deepen the wounds of the 
past few weeks," Fitzwater said before the President's decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Defending Bush's efforts thus far in trying to pressure the Chinese leadership 
to relax its repression of the pro-democracy movement, the White House 
spokesman said that "the President has spoken out faster and stronger than any 
other world leader. His position has been unequivocal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Break in Trade Sought 
</P>
<P>
He said that the President would refrain from seeking to interrupt U.S. trade 
with Beijing because such commercial activity is "in the best interests of the 
United States' relationship with China." 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, the economic development in China, at least the President seems to 
believe, is for the benefit of the Chinese people and will promote the movement 
toward political liberalization," said one government official familiar with 
the formulation of the Administration's China policy. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials are uncertain whether executions of those sentenced to 
death can be averted, and whether China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, and 
Premier Li Peng will continue to pursue hard-line policies indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"It may depend on how solidly Deng, Li and company feel they are in control," 
said one American observer of China. "If they feel they have terrorized people 
enough, then clemency is possible. If they feel they need to terrorize people 
more, then executions are possible." 
</P>
<P>
As Deng has overseen the liberalization of Chinese economic and political life 
over the last 10 years, trade between the United States and China has 
increased, with the Chinese gaining access to much sought-after Western 
technology for their modernization efforts. Any interruption of international 
financing likely would slow the economic progress on which Deng has focused. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$14 Billion in Trade 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, two-way trade between the United States and China totaled $14 billion, 
and it had been expected to reach as much as $16 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to seeking the World Bank loans, the Chinese are seeking membership 
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization of 
96 nations that administers world trade rules. Until the government used 
military force to quell demonstrations in and around Tian An Man Square 2 1/2 
weeks ago, China was expected to gain entry to the organization. The United 
States now could lobby against such a step. 
</P>
<P>
In a further move, the United States could withdraw the "most favored nation" 
trade status awarded to China, a status granted to favored trading partners to 
ease access to U.S. markets. However, Bush is believed to be reluctant to take 
any measures that would be difficult to reverse and that would hurt the Chinese 
people economically.

A Norwegian coast guard ship cut through thick Arctic ice Tuesday to rescue 
hundreds of people who had taken refuge on ice floes and in lifeboats after 
their Soviet cruise liner hit an iceberg and took on water. All of the nearly 
600 passengers were reported safe.

"All the passengers are now off the vessel and only (some of the) the crew 
remains," said Arne Finne, a spokesman for the Rescue Center in Bodoe, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, some of the Soviet crew members -- who had remained aboard the 
Maxim Gorky -- stabilized the badly listing vessel and sailed toward port with 
the help of a coast guard ship and several pumps flown from Norway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
740 Reach Spitsbergen 
</P>
<P>
Early today -- more than 25 hours after their ordeal began -- about 740 
passengers and crew of the estimated 950 aboard reached the Norwegian Arctic 
outpost at Spitsbergen, officials said. Passengers were taken to the airport on 
the tiny island of 1,000 people for chartered flights back home. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the Soviet crew had worked to keep the 630-foot ocean liner 
afloat in the Norwegian Sea, about 185 miles west of Spitsbergen, while the 
rescue ship and helicopters saved passengers huddling in blankets in the 
near-freezing temperatures. There were no reports of serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky rammed the iceberg in the foggy Arctic twilight shortly after 
midnight, when many of the passengers were partying in a shipboard nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly there was a terrible crash that almost shook me from my bed," said 
Rudolf Ludwig, 67, of Wiesbaden, West Germany, one of the passengers on the 
midnight sun cruise who was evacuated by helicopter to Norway's Svalbard 
island. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told to get into the lifeboats," Ludwig said. "We sat for five hours 
among the icebergs. The atmosphere was calm, and the Russian sailors did 
everything they could. They gave us vodka and whiskey in the boats, since it 
was cold. And blankets, too." 
</P>
<P>
West German passenger Win-fried Prince said there was no panic, and "the 
Russian crew has worked perfectly in disembarking passengers into lifeboats, 
and also the Norwegians who picked us up . . . have done a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ripped Two Holes 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred early Tuesday when the iceberg ripped two holes in the 
ship, which quickly took on water. Passengers said three decks became 
submerged. 
</P>
<P>
The coast guard vessel Senja, its bow reinforced for ice-breaking, rushed to 
the site about 300 miles east of northern Greenland. It reached the area after 
about four hours to begin rescue work. Soviet ships arrived later to continue 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Although reports of the number of people aboard the liner varied, the agency 
that chartered the vessel said there were 953 aboard -- 575 passengers and 378 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
Johannes Zurnieden, manager of the Phoenix-Flugreisen tourist agency in West 
Germany, said all but 16 of the passengers were West Germans. The others 
included Austrian, Swiss, Italian, British, Dutch and Swedish passengers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clambered Into Lifeboats 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, about 350 passengers clambered into lifeboats and some were 
taken to ice floes before being plucked to safety by Norwegian and Soviet 
helicopters. They later were moved onto a Norwegian rescue vessel in the 
Barents Sea, the coast guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 200 passengers who had remained aboard the 25,000-ton vessel were 
evacuated and picked up by the Senja. 
</P>
<P>
The captain of the Senja, Sigurd Kleiven, said the Maxim Gorky had two gashes 
in the starboard hull, one measuring 30 inches by 8 feet and the other 2 inches 
by 19 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Kleiven said that after his ship's arrival, two of the Senja's pumps were taken 
aboard the crippled liner. One pump later broke down. 
</P>
<P>
Divers inspected the gashes, but there was nothing available to plug them with, 
Kleiven said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Finn B. Hansen of the North Norway Rescue Coordination Center said the 
Soviet tugboat Sarja arrived with more pumps and two more vessels steamed 
toward the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like there is enough new pumping equipment aboard to keep it afloat," 
Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, the crew managed to stabilize the ship despite the gashes and set 
sail for Barentsburg, 300 miles to the east, trailed by a coast guard ship, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is under control, thanks to comprehensive pumping equipment 
continuously brought to the vessel throughout the day," a coast guard spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky had set out June 11 from Bremerhaven, West Germany, sailed to 
Iceland and, then, while sailing around the Spitsbergen island chain on its way 
to Norway, struck the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Meteorological Institute sends out weekly ice charts of the area, 
but the situation changes too quickly to be dependable for navigation, the 
Norwegian news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was reportedly foggy at the time of the accident, it was not fully 
dark because the area around the Arctic Circle is light nearly 24 hours a day 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven years ago, on April 14, 1912, the British luxury liner Titanic 
hit an iceberg just south of Newfoundland on its maiden voyage. Of 2,224 people 
aboard, 1,513 died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fared Better 
</P>
<P>
Steinar Breivik at the Bodoe Rescue Center said the Maxim Gorky fared better 
because damage to the Titanic was apparently much worse and because the Soviet 
vessel "received pumping equipment within a few hours, both from land and from 
other ships." 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky was built in West Germany in 1969 and sold to the Soviet Union 
in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have been involved in the cruise business for foreigners for about 
15 years. The Soviet merchant fleet began expanding passenger liners for the 
cruise trade as well as purchasing new ships during the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The collision with the iceberg is the latest disaster or near-disaster reported 
openly under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reformist policy of 
disclosure of events. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst Soviet shipping disaster, the cruise ship Admiral Nakhimov was 
rammed by a grain freighter in the Black Sea in August, 1986, killing 398 of 
1,236 people aboard.

A far-reaching $1.5-billion education finance bill that has drawn strong 
opposition from Los Angeles because it would direct funds from big-city schools 
into suburban and rural school districts fell one vote short of passage Tuesday 
in its initial test before the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
With Los Angeles lawmakers leading the opposition, the bill, needing 12 votes 
to pass, went down on an 11-6 vote. Missing when the votes were counted was 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), a key Republican who helped put the 
compromise school funding bill together. Nolan left the committee hearing early 
to fly home to Southern California to present an award to a graduating high 
school senior in La Canada on Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Since Nolan is expected to return to the Capitol today, supporters believe that 
they will have enough votes to pass the bill out of committee. 
</P>
<P>
But the setback shows that the compromise school funding plan has a long way to 
go before it becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the bill does not contain all the elements of the deal that was put 
together by rural and suburban legislators. Parties to the compromise said 
there was agreement that it would be amended on the floor of the Assembly, and 
then undergo further changes as it moves through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still a lot of negotiating taking place," said Assemblyman Robert J. 
Campbell (D-Richmond), who helped negotiate the package with Nolan and others. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would implement Proposition 98, the landmark public school and 
community college funding measure approved by voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
It would provide schools with a total of $557 million for this fiscal year, a 
figure that includes $251 million for a basic 4.6% increase in state aid to all 
school districts and an extra $120 million this year for schoolbooks and 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
In the next budget year, which actually begins July 1, the bill would provide 
an additional $952 million to schools. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's allotment would set aside roughly $300 million to give school 
districts throughout the state a more equal share of the billions in financial 
aid going into more than 50 special education programs. 
</P>
<P>
It is that provision that has drawn strong opposition from the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, the largest and most politically influential district 
in the state, because it would deny the city school system a proportional split 
of the financial pie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Support 
</P>
<P>
Republican and Democratic lawmakers from throughout the state support the plan 
because they argue that Los Angeles Unified is now getting far more than its 
fair share of state financial aid going to schools. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to counter those arguments, John Mockler, the lobbyist for Los Angeles 
Unified, told the committee Tuesday that Los Angeles has special needs because 
of its inner-city student population. Mockler said that Los Angeles Unified 
enrolls 13% of the state's kindergarten through high school students, but has a 
disproportionate 20% share of the state's school-age children from welfare 
families and 27% of California's non-English speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the six votes cast against the bill were registered by Los Angeles 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is being carried by Assemblywoman Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles), 
chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee. Although students in her 
district attend Los Angeles schools, Hughes said that she felt a responsibility 
to schoolchildren throughout the state and argued that the bill overall was a 
good one. "Hold your nose and vote 'aye,' " she told her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and legislative leaders 
continued to charge each other with standing in the way of a broader budget 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Honig, in a morning press conference, appeared with members of PTA groups, 
teachers' unions and other supporters of public schools to denounce what they 
said was an effort "to dismantle Proposition 98." 
</P>
<P>
Honig, under fire from legislative leaders for refusing to compromise, said he 
will not give in to suggestions by lawmakers that schools give up the guarantee 
of 40% of the state budget that they won with Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Must Think We Are Crazy' 
</P>
<P>
"They must think we are crazy if they think we are going to roll over," Honig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) responded angrily 
that "Mr. Honig has been a participant in the (proposed) repeal" and is 
critical only because lawmakers are refusing his plan to amend the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said, "He's sick and tired, and 
we're sick and tired." 
</P>
<P>
Maddy and Roberti, along with leaders of the Assembly, met again with Gov. 
George Deukmejian Tuesday in an effort to work out a budget agreement. Roberti 
said "a lot of work is left" to do before an agreement is reached.

INDUSTRY SPOKESMEN OUTGUN CONSUMERS AT PROP. 103 HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the two-day Los Angeles phase of Insurance Department hearings on 
implementing Proposition 103, industry representatives vastly outnumbered those 
from consumer groups, and at times the consumer advocates were absent 
altogether as industry lawyers urged interpretations that would dilute the 
force of key parts of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, no one challenged a State Farm representative who argued that a 
Proposition 103 provision saying a driver's safety record has more "importance" 
in setting rates than where the driver lives simply means the safety record 
should be considered first, not necessarily be given greater weight. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, author of Proposition 103, said Tuesday in an interview that 
the State Farm interpretation "defies logic" and was not at all what he 
intended when he wrote the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But Rosenfield was not present for any of the hearings Monday and Tuesday, and 
his Voter Revolt organization had an aide on hand only briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield, who was in New Jersey helping to set up a Voter Revolt chapter 
there, declared, after Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie had decried his 
failure to appear in Los Angeles, that he would appear "at some point" for one 
of two days of hearings to be held Thursday and Friday in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's hearing, Steven Miller, director of the Insurance Consumer Action 
Network, told Gillespie, "Unfortunately, consumer groups do not have the 
resources necessary" to counter overwhelming industry input into how various 
provisions of Proposition 103 should be interpreted or to challenge impending 
insurer rate filings. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, we have no money to hire actuaries or attorneys," he said. "We 
have no money for staff. . . . For every consumer representative, there are 40 
or 50 companies ready to put on people to represent their interests." 
</P>
<P>
Miller and other consumers have expressed disappointment that Gillespie has put 
many restrictions on a provision in Proposition 103 that authorizes her to 
order insurance companies to pay "reasonable advocacy and witness fees and 
expenses" to consumer representatives who make "a substantial contribution" to 
rate decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Without some advance assurance that they will get money, consumer advocates 
will not be able to risk hiring usually high-paid actuaries to build a case, 
Miller said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie responded that she is concerned that politicians might move in on the 
process if such "intervenor fees" are offered in advance. But she lunched with 
Miller after Tuesday's hearing to discuss the issue and indicated she might yet 
relax her standards. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of substantial consumer representation at the Los Angeles 
hearings, the commissioner herself stepped in on several occasions Tuesday to 
make the consumers' points for them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
It was a good political opportunity for Gillespie, who last week filed a notice 
of intent to run for the commissioner's job when it becomes an elective 
position next year. A Republican who was once an insurance company executive, 
she has frequently been criticized by Rosenfield and other consumer activists 
for allegedly being too close to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, when a lawyer for the Preferred Risk Mutual Co. of Iowa, a restricted 
membership organization, urged the Insurance Department to let his company 
continue to turn away "good drivers" who do not meet the firm's other 
eligibility requirements, despite a provision in Proposition 103 saying such 
drivers cannot be turned away, Gillespie remarked sharply: 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very difficult. . . . Proposition 103 does require changes." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Gillespie challenged a spokesman for Farmers when he said that his 
company had been communicating with its customers to tell them that 
requirements for a 20% good driver discount in Proposition 103 should not be 
interpreted to mean their rates will go down below what they are now. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of your policyholders and I've heard nothing from you," Gillespie 
interjected. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you paid your premium?" Farmers spokesman Stephen J. Feely asked. "If you 
have, it should be in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Department 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie had nothing to say, however, when two consumer advocates charged the 
Insurance Department with dragging its feet in enforcing Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
When Joseph Gardner of the Baldwin Hills Estates Homeowners Assn. complained 
bitterly that seven months after the passage of Proposition 103 its rate 
rollbacks have not been implemented and asked, "Why won't the bureaucracy of 
the state implement it?" Gillespie was silent. 
</P>
<P>
And she had no response either when a retired Insurance Department employee, 
Joseph Waldbaum, suggested that if she is really interested in implementing 
rate rollbacks, she will send audit teams to the offices of the seven biggest 
insurers in the state to conduct independent examinations of their books, 
rather than meekly accept their statements that their profits are so small that 
they should be exempted from the rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
For every minute taken up at the Los Angeles hearings by Miller, Gardner and 
Waldbaum, however, by rough calculation, insurance company representatives 
spoke about five minutes.

FIRMS, LOBBIES HELPED PROVIDE FUNDS FOR SEN. WILSON'S TRAVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On March 4, 1988, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) flew home to San Diego to take 
one of the biggest steps of his political career: opening his campaign for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
By all appearances, it was the usual campaign kickoff extravaganza. Beginning 
in San Diego, Wilson barnstormed seven California cities, making speeches at 
every stop. 
</P>
<P>
But what did not come to light until Wilson recently filed his personal 
financial disclosure report for 1988 was that the first-class fare for the 
cross-country legs of his trip was paid for by neither his campaign treasury 
nor his Senate travel account. Instead, it was picked up by General Electric 
Credit Corp., a GE subsidiary headquartered in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's March campaign journey was one of a dozen trips the senator made 
between Washington and California last year at the expense of various 
corporations and lobbying groups. In fact, the records show that California's 
junior senator clearly has become a leader in a practice employed by some 
Western-state members of Congress -- relying on special interest groups to pay 
the costs of their routine travel. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the phenomenon so surprising is that the American taxpayers already 
provide Wilson and other members of Congress with money to travel between the 
nation's capital and their home state. Moreover, campaign trips paid for by 
special interests tread dangerously close to federal laws that forbid 
congressional candidates from receiving free services from corporations. 
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent rich corporations from buying elections, federal law 
prohibits candidates from accepting corporate money, either directly or 
indirectly. But members of Congress seeking reelection can take corporate money 
or services for specific appearances as long as they can demonstrate that the 
event was separate from their campaign. Thus Wilson's GE-paid air fare was 
legal because he delivered a speech to the group during his 10-day trip to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wilson's aides, the senator often prefers to travel back and forth 
between Washington and California at the expense of special interest groups 
when possible because it permits him to use his $95,000-a-year official 
congressional expense account for other purposes -- such as paying the expenses 
of aides who want to accompany him on these trips. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity not to use taxpayers' money," said Bill Livingston, 
Wilson's press secretary. "It's an opportunity to stretch the funds so he can 
go out to the state more often. If we had unlimited amounts of tax money, we'd 
never have to worry about this." 
</P>
<P>
But critics view this practice as another way that special interests have found 
to ingratiate themselves to members of Congress by picking up the tab for 
everything from a meal to exotic foreign trips -- a system that Common Cause 
President Fred Wertheimer describes as "legalized corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, Washington lobbyists for big special interest groups and major 
corporations report that they often receive telephone calls from congressional 
staffers who are soliciting free transportation for their bosses to the home 
district or other locations. Congressional aides refer to this practice as 
"prospecting." In exchange for free transportation, members of Congress are 
usually willing to make a brief speech or take a plant tour. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Wilson or his staff actively solicited any of his free 
trips during 1988. Linda Royster, Wilson's assistant press secretary, said the 
senator now has a policy against soliciting such trips, but she acknowledged 
that "it has not always been the policy," and she was unable to say exactly 
when the change occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies or groups that funded Wilson's travel said they offered to 
pay the air fare or could not remember how it was agreed to. A representative 
of General Electric Credit Corp. declined to discuss how the March 4-14 trip 
was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of Congress accept invitations from special interests to make 
speeches in such popular vacation spots as Jamaica, Boca Raton, Fla., and Palm 
Springs. Usually, these trips are nothing more than thinly disguised vacations 
for members of Congress and their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
But most members of Congress do not regularly accept free trips to their home 
districts, not only because the government provides the funding for those trips 
but also because they do not believe that businesses in their home states 
should be forced to pay for such appearances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposite View 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson takes the opposite view from many of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and his wife spurn free trips to exotic places as unseemly. At the same 
time, Wilson sees nothing wrong with accepting travel expenses and honorariums 
from well-heeled, California-based groups as well as others that have chosen to 
gather in California, because he believes that they can afford it. Livingston 
noted that Wilson does not demand reimbursement from Californians who cannot. 
</P>
<P>
"California is different from most states," he added. "California has many 
Fortune 500 companies, and it doesn't make a bit of difference to them whether 
they pay for a speech." 
</P>
<P>
Among the groups that paid for Wilson to fly to home last year were the 
California Winegrape Growers, the California Independent Oil Producers, William 
Lyon University of San Diego, the Merchants and Manufacturers of California and 
the Oakland-based Western States Meat Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Although other Californians, such as Reps. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), Norman D. 
Shumway (R-Stockton), Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) and Howard Berman (D-Los 
Angeles), also reported making trips home to California at the expense of 
special interests during 1988, none of them did it nearly as often as Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations or lobbying groups paid for more than a third of Wilson's 32 
round-trips between Washington and California in 1988. By comparison, Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) made three such round trips in 1988 -- one financed by the 
United Food and Commercial Workers, another by the Center for Participation in 
Democracy and one by a voter-registration organization that Cranston leads. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Wilson delivered a speech in exchange for his air fare. But 
Wilson's aides said he did not make a speech in exchange for taking a free 
flight, along with his wife, back to California aboard a private Beech Aircraft 
plane after the couple attended the Republican National Convention in New 
Orleans last August. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's aides said the plane stopped briefly at Wichita, Kan., where Beech is 
headquartered, to allow the senator and his wife to tour the aircraft plant and 
have lunch with a high-ranking company officials. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, refused to accept the 
offer of a $2,000 honorarium from Beech for the stop. It is not unusual for 
members of Congress to be offered honorariums for simply touring a plant. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston said the senator does not take honorariums from defense contractors 
because it would create "a perception" that they are buying his vote on the 
committee. Nevertheless, he acknowledged, Wilson has no policy against 
accepting air fare from defense contractors because the cost otherwise would 
fall on the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter written to Beech after Wilson's visit to Wichita, Ira H. Goldman, 
the senator's counsel, explained to company officials that the air fare for the 
senator and his wife did not constitute an illegal campaign contribution 
because it was not undertaken -- in the language of the law -- "in connection 
with a federal election." Instead, he said, even though Wilson was a candidate 
for reelection, the trip was intended only "to familiarize himself with your 
company's operations and engage in discussions with a group of corporate 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exemption Would Apply 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Goldman noted that the law exempts travel expenses paid in 
connection with an appearance for which a senator receives an honorarium. He 
said this exemption would apply to Wilson's trip, even though he declined the 
honorarium. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever corporations are involved in financing portions of a campaign trip for 
Wilson, as General Electric Credit Corp. did in March, 1988, the senator's 
staff takes special precautions not to violate the law prohibiting corporations 
from making in-kind contributions to congressional candidates. Such payments 
are legal as long as the corporation or lobbying group does not pay for any leg 
of the trip immediately preceding a campaign stop. 
</P>
<P>
On March 4, 1988, for example, General Electric Credit Corp. paid for Wilson to 
fly only as far as Reno, Nev. -- where he stopped to give a speech to the 
California Medical Assn. -- but his campaign treasury picked up the air fare 
for the final leg of the journey into San Diego, where he kicked off his 
reelection campaign. Wilson's wife preceded him to California on March 3, also 
at the expense of GE. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as Wilson barnstormed the state beginning on Sunday, March 7, each of 
those flights was charged either to the campaign or to Wilson's Senate expense 
account. In fact, it was not until March 9, when Wilson arrived in Los Angeles, 
that he met with the group that paid for his round-trip air fare from 
Washington to California, the General Electric Credit Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and his wife returned to Washington together on March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, this complex system for allocating the costs of Wilson's many trips 
creates an accounting nightmare for his staff, and mistakes are possible. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Wilson's staff reported that he had received a $1,039 government 
reimbursement for one Washington-to-California round-trip in January, 1988, for 
which he also reported receiving an honorarium and reimbursement from a Los 
Angeles-based investment firm, Capitol Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But Livingston said that Wilson's accountant mistakenly credited the government 
reimbursement to that trip -- a mistake he said would be corrected. 
Furthermore, he said the check that Wilson received for $1,039 represents an 
automatic travel payment that every senator receives from the government at the 
beginning of every session of Congress, even if the senator never left 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Expense 
</P>
<P>
According to Livingston, Wilson's reliance on special-interest money for travel 
to California enables him to return to the state more frequently and to take 
his aides with him whenever necessary. Records show at least three employees of 
Wilson's Washington office were traveling in California at government expense 
during the senator's March campaign swing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Wilson received a total of $1.9 million from the government to run his 
offices in Washington and California -- all but $95,000 of it earmarked for 
staff salaries. In addition, the National Republican Campaign Committee 
provided him with $20,597 for media, publications and support services. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of government money available to members of Congress for travel and 
other expenses is based on the distance between Washington and their home 
states. The sum of $95,000 a year allocated for California's senators compares 
to $137,000 set aside for those from Alaska and $36,000 for those from 
Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

ADMINISTRATION DEALT SETBACK ON OFFSHORE DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a blow to Bush Administration hopes for a consensus on offshore drilling, a 
House Appropriations subcommittee voted Tuesday to delay new federal offshore 
oil drilling and pre-lease activities along the California coast until at least 
October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The action, sponsored by Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) and strongly opposed 
by the Administration, would renew a congressional moratorium that has blocked 
new drilling off the California coast for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The step would delay a White House plan to resolve the long-standing 
controversy by next January and would significantly reduce the influence of a 
high-level task force appointed by President Bush to review the drilling plans. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, sponsored by a bipartisan majority of the state's congressional 
delegation, is expected to face bitter opposition when it is taken up by the 
full Appropriations Committee, where action is expected as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials reacted sharply to the panel's action. 
</P>
<P>
"Not until we have brownouts or long gas lines will people realize that we have 
to get oil from somewhere," Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still the illusion that around every corner there's a tanker and that 
every tanker is another Valdez," Goldstein said. "That has got to be defused." 
</P>
<P>
Leading opponents of offshore drilling, however, described the action, taken on 
a voice vote of the subcommittee on the interior, as a major victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration was trying to steal the initiative," said Lisa Speer, a 
senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "This sends a very 
clear message that its task force is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
The Panetta moratorium, included as an amendment to a proposed appropriations 
bill for the Interior Department, calls for a far more sweeping halt to 
drilling plans than has ever been previously approved. 
</P>
<P>
It includes for the first time a complete ban on new drilling activity along 
the length of California and would also halt planned drilling in Alaska's 
Bristol Bay and off the coast of several Mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
Bush sought to demonstrate his concern for the environment in his State of the 
Union message, in part, by announcing delays in drilling plans for two major 
California lease sales -- Lease Sale 91 off Northern California and Lease Sale 
95 off Southern California -- and for another proposed drilling site off the 
coast of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
That plan had no effect on another proposed area, Lease Sale 119 off Central 
California, however. It permitted pre-leasing activity to continue on all three 
sites while the task force pondered whether actual drilling should go forward. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration panel, headed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., is to 
report to Bush by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new congressional moratorium would halt even pre-leasing steps, 
such as public hearings and environmental impact statements, for all three 
California lease sales until October, 1990, when fiscal 1990 ends. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta said the bill would allow Congress to "review the recommendations of 
the President's task force and any actions he takes as a result of that report. 
</P>
<P>
"In doing so," Panetta continued, "we can lay the groundwork for a long-term 
solution that protects coastal communities and the coastal environment." 
</P>
<P>
But Interior spokesman Goldstein dismissed the moratorium as a "delaying tactic 
that doesn't help to address the real issue, and that is how do we handle 
offshore drilling in this country."

GOP CONSULTANT ADMITS USING INFLUENCE TO OBTAIN HUD GRANT BUT DEFENDS ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Republican political consultant acknowledged Tuesday that he used his 
influence to obtain a $43-million Department of Housing and Urban Development 
rehabilitation and rent-subsidy grant for a developer client, but he insisted 
that he acted "within the system." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony by Paul Manafort at a sometimes stormy hearing of a House 
Government Operations subcommittee came after local officials from New Jersey 
who were affected by the HUD decision complained that they were never consulted 
in advance about the grant and did not want it. 
</P>
<P>
Manafort's high-powered lobbying and public relations firm received a $326,000 
fee for its work in getting HUD approval of the grant largely through personal 
influence with Deborah Gore Dean, an executive assistant to former HUD 
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Became Partner 
</P>
<P>
Later, Manafort became a 20% partner in the development firm that acquired the 
326-unit apartment project that benefited from HUD's grant to provide improved 
housing for low-income people. The firm bought the units in the Seabrook 
subdivision of Upper Deerfield, N.J., two weeks before the New Jersey Public 
Housing Authority was notified that HUD had approved the funding. 
</P>
<P>
Manafort said that Lawrence Gay, an associate in his consulting firm, talked to 
Dean on Nov. 14, 1986, about the grant and told her that it had the support of 
the New Jersey housing authority. She asked that agency to file an application. 
Six days later, at the urging of another of Manafort's associates, New Jersey 
officials complied and the grant was approved by HUD the following February. 
</P>
<P>
"A very smelly, sleazy business," said Rep. Christropher Shays (R-Conn.). "I 
feel it wasn't a meritorious project. People who knew how the system worked 
were able to get their project approved even if it wasn't meritorious." 
</P>
<P>
Manafort, a former Republican campaign adviser, replied: "We worked the system 
as it existed. I don't think we did anything illegal or improper." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1,000 an Hour 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Manafort said that it was logical to infer that his firm charged 
$1,000 per hour for its work on a project involving low-cost housing and 
low-income people that he said came to about $100,000 a year for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"By Washington standards, that is not very high," said Manafort, who has never 
visited the New Jersey housing site. He said that his consulting firm normally 
accepts clients only if they pay a $250,000 annual retainer. 
</P>
<P>
Previous witnesses before the subcommittee have testified that Pierce 
controlled grants for a moderate rehabilitation program through his office, 
with Dean playing a central role. Dean invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege 
against self-incrimination when she was subpoenaed by the House panel, but she 
indicated that she may testify later if she gets access to HUD documents about 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Not Consulted 
</P>
<P>
Unlike another celebrated case in which former Secretary of the Interior James 
G. Watt received a $300,000 fee for obtaining a similar grant for an Essex, 
Md., low-income housing project, however, local officials were not consulted 
and did not back the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce T. Peterson, the mayor of Upper Deerfield, said that neither he nor his 
predecessor was consulted about the rehabilitation plans and were not informed 
by the state housing agency when the grant was made. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the units, originally constructed during World War II as temporary 
quarters for farm workers, were in such bad condition that they should have 
been torn down rather than rehabilitated, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the rents proposed for the renovated units are much higher than 
for comparable apartments in the area, he said, with a corresponding increase 
in the amount of federal subsidies that HUD will have to pay to supplement the 
partial rents paid by low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a horrible waste of taxpayers' money," Peterson said, adding that 
he would rather have received half of the $43 million to spend as the community 
wished on low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Manafort insisted that the mayor did not understand the program. He said that 
his development firm took a risk by buying the Seabrook apartments because the 
New Jersey housing agency advertised for other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Ad Placed 
</P>
<P>
Members of the subcommittee, however, noted that a single ad was placed in the 
Millville (N.J.) Daily on May 18, after Manafort's firm had acquired the 
property and less than two weeks before Manafort's firm was awarded the 
rehabilitation contract on June 1. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a sham and illusion that this was publicly advertised," said Rep. Tom 
Lantos (D-San Mateo), the subcommittee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) put it more bluntly, telling Manafort: "They 
could have cut out all this language and written: 'The fix is in.' "

NORTH SENTENCING DELAYED TO ALLOW HEARING ON JUROR'S CONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A federal judge Tuesday postponed the sentencing of former White House aide 
Oliver L. North until July 5 to provide time for a court hearing into defense 
allegations that a juror may have used drugs and lied to hide the fact that 
members of her family had been prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell unsealed court papers in which North's 
attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., challenged the conduct of juror Tara Leigh 
King. But independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, in filings responding to the 
charges, called the allegations "thin" and "unsubstantiated" and said that 
North's lawyers were trying "to impeach the jury's verdict." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell, in an act that suggested he does not believe the issue will impair the 
jury's May 4 verdict convicting North of three felonies in the Iran-Contra 
scandal, ordered a 12-day postponement in North's sentencing rather than 
suspending it indefinitely. But he said that he will conduct a full hearing on 
June 28. 
</P>
<P>
Court sources said that the judge regards the issue as serious enough to 
require "a full airing of the facts" so that the trial record can be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, in a motion dated May 30 that was unsealed Tuesday, contended that 
King, 34, a copy machine operator, "has periodically admitted to the use of 
narcotics (i.e., crack) close to the time of trial." 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility that a juror might have been under the influence of narcotics 
during the trial calls into question the fairness of the proceeding and 
warrants further inquiry," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan questioned King's veracity also, saying that she had "family members 
who were involved in the criminal justice process and . . . this involvement 
was not disclosed on the jury questionnaire" that King and other jurors 
completed before North's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan later produced records for the court showing that three of King's 14 
brothers and sisters have arrest records. The records include an armed robbery 
conviction against one brother, and drug cases dropped against two others. 
</P>
<P>
However, Walsh replied in his filings that the only substantiation for drug use 
occurred in King's post-trial interviews with reporters in which she 
acknowledged having used cocaine and marijuana up to four months before the 
trial but not while she sat on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh contended that there is no evidence that King was aware of any arrest 
records of family members or that she had them in mind when she was asked to 
disclose whether any relatives ever had been involved in "civil or criminal 
proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
North was originally scheduled to be sentenced Friday.

EXODUS OF STRIKE FORCE PROSECUTORS PREDICTED

Former chiefs of federal organized crime strike forces warned Tuesday that 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's plan to merge the special units into U.S. 
attorneys' offices will lead experienced anti-mob prosecutors to leave the 
government in droves. 
</P>
<P>
Edward A. McDonald, who headed the Brooklyn strike force for seven years until 
he entered private practice this month, told the House Judiciary subcommittee 
on criminal justice that most of his former colleagues in that office "are out 
looking for jobs" because of Thornburgh's controversial decision. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Serene, a former strike force prosecutor in Boston and a special counsel 
in the Justice Department's criminal division, said that Thornburgh's move will 
result in "an exodus of a wealth of talented prosecutors." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of "institutional memory" will lessen the chances that a wiretapped 
conversation referring to "a mob hit 20 years ago" will be recognized as such 
by less experienced prosecutors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But David Runkel, Thornburgh's chief spokesman, said that he has had no 
indication that any of the 125 strike force lawyers across the country will 
quit rather than transfer to special organized crime units inside the U.S. 
attorneys' offices. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are committed to the fight against organized crime, I assume they'll 
stay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.), chairman of the subcommittee, said that he 
was "puzzled" by Thornburgh's announcement of his decision Monday on the eve of 
the scheduled subcommittee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed that he would wait until both sides could publicly air their views 
before finalizing his plans," Schumer said. "Unfortunately, he appears to have 
made his decision before public hearings can even begin." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stiff Opposition Likely 
</P>
<P>
The sharply critical testimony and Schumer's dismay over Thornburgh's timing 
indicate that the attorney general's plan faces stiff opposition. Some 
senators, including Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), Strom Thurmond (R-S. C.), Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), had urged Thornburgh to hold off 
on his decision. A joint hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the 
Governmental Affairs permanent investigations subcommittee is expected next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer noted that a supplemental appropriation sought by the Justice 
Department and scheduled to be taken up by the House today bars any 
reorganization in the department until Oct. 1. Thornburgh has said that he 
expects to implement the merger no later than Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Edward S. G. Dennis, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice 
Department's criminal division, defended the planned merger as a way to end 
turf wars between strike force leaders and U.S. attorneys and to achieve 
greater efficiency in the fight against the Mafia and newly emerging organized 
crime groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is are we going to spend 30% of our time arguing over whose case 
it is or are we going out to make that case," Dennis told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Strike force attorneys are "professionals," Dennis said, adding: "When the gun 
sounds, I think we'll all be on the mark." 
</P>
<P>
But Peter F. Vaira, who served as U.S. attorney in Philadelphia and headed 
strike forces in Chicago and Philadelphia, disputed Dennis' contention that, 
once the strike forces are folded into special units inside U.S. attorneys' 
offices, they will be able to maintain the fight against organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you that three years from now it will take the FBI to find the 
strike forces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A U.S. attorney always needs experienced attorneys to work on priority cases 
such as local political corruption," Vaira said. "It is only a matter of time 
until the best and most experienced attorneys will be working on the 'hot' 
cases and younger, less experienced attorneys will be assigned to develop 
organized crime cases that require years of work and may be brought in another 
district."

PANEL OKS GREGG AS S. KOREA ENVOY

Closing a brief but contentious debate over President Bush's role in the 
Iran-Contra scandal, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Tuesday approved 
the nomination of Donald P. Gregg to be ambassador to South Korea, despite 
lingering questions about his relationship with former White House aide Oliver 
L. North. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 12 to 7, the panel recommended that the full Senate confirm the 
nomination of Gregg, who served as then-Vice President Bush's national security 
adviser during most of the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) had charged that Gregg, a former CIA officer, was 
involved in North's secret efforts to provide aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels 
during the period when Congress had prohibited such funding. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston also accused Gregg of "misleading" the committee by denying that he 
knew anything about North's covert operations in Central America during 1985 
and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But Gregg insisted that despite several meetings with North and others involved 
in the operation -- and documents from those meetings that referred to supplies 
for the Contras -- he did not realize what was going on until news reports of 
the activities at the end of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We are being asked to reward a man many of us do not believe has been straight 
with us while under oath," Cranston said. "We are being asked to promote a man 
to a crucial diplomatic post whose judgment -- by his own admission -- has been 
so flawed that he twice offered to resign from then-Vice President Bush's 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gregg has not been straight with us," Cranston repeated. "The implications 
for Mr. Gregg -- and for the President -- are not pleasant ones." 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston failed to sway any of the panel's nine Republicans. Three 
Democrats -- Sens. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) and Terry 
Sanford (D-N.C.) -- also voted in favor of Gregg's confirmation.

<P>
'Benefit of Doubt' 
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded that Mr. Gregg and the President should be given the benefit 
of the doubt," said Pell, the committee's chairman and a liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Robb, a Southern moderate, said that he considers Gregg's account "as 
reasonable and believable as I think we could expect under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's evidence included two 1986 memos from Gregg to Bush setting up a 
briefing on "resupply of the Contras" and a 1985 entry in North's personal 
notebook that appears to record a meeting with Gregg to discuss the Contras' 
logistical needs. Gregg said that he did not know how the term "resupply of the 
Contras" had landed in his memo and denied that the briefing covered that 
issue. He also denied attending the meeting that was described in North's 
notebook. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) said that he would attempt to block 
three of President Bush's other ambassadorial nominees on grounds that their 
only qualifications appeared to be large contributions to Republican political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes Nominations 
</P>
<P>
He said he would fight the nominations of Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to 
Spain, Melvin F. Sembler to be ambassador to Australia, and Della M. Newman to 
be ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Newman was asked by a New Zealand newspaper after her nomination if she could 
name the country's prime minister -- David Lange -- and could not. Her husband, 
Wells McCurdy, was a fund raiser for Bush's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing, on occasion, to have to hold your nose and approve a 
nomination like this, but we're being asked to do it again and again and 
again," Sarbanes complained.

Three Palestinians said they met a Jewish settler who was hiking in the 
occupied West Bank, chatted with him, posed for a picture and then stabbed him 
to death, Israeli officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested during the night by agents of the Shin Bet security 
service in the death Saturday of U.S.-born Frederick S. Rosenfeld, 48, of the 
West Bank settlement of Ariel, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The army later blew up the homes of the suspects, who are from the nearby 
village of Burkin, Israel Radio said. The army, using bulldozers, also 
demolished two houses of Palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs at 
military patrols in the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, army radio said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calling for Harshness 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeld's slaying has enraged Jewish settlers and right-wing politicians who 
have called for harsher measures, including deportations and the death penalty, 
to crush the 18-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israel's occupation of 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Whistles, boos and shouts of "revenge," "traitor" and "go home" nearly drowned 
out Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir during his eulogy at the cemetery in the new 
settlement of Barqan, about three miles from Ariel. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the shouting, settlers waved Israeli flags and posters saying,"We 
Will Still Avenge Your Blood, Rosenfeld." 
</P>
<P>
Settlement leaders and a large police force surrounded the pale-faced Shamir to 
protect him from the angry jeering crowd as he walked to his car after the 
service. Chanting "revenge, revenge," some settlers managed to pound his car 
with their fists. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the service, a settler opened fire with an Uzi submachine gun on 
a group of Arabs waiting at a major intersection near Tel Aviv, police 
spokeswoman Dalia Gilad said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinians were wounded, one of them seriously, she said. The assailant 
was apprehended after being chased by police and residents. He was not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The three Palestinians accused of slaying Rosenfeld came upon the settler 
Saturday while he was hiking on a barren hillside near the Arab village of 
Burkin, about three miles from Ariel, according to security officials. 
</P>
<P>
They said the Arabs told agents during interrogation that Rosenfeld chatted 
with them, took their pictures with his camera and asked them to take a 
photograph of him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stabbed in the Back 
</P>
<P>
One of them then grabbed Rosenfeld's knife and stabbed him in the back, said 
the official. 
</P>
<P>
They said the three Arabs were taken to the scene Tuesday to reenact the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Other Palestinian shepherds found Rosenfeld's body Sunday morning. An empty 
pistol holster, two spent cartridges, a map and binoculars were found near the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
There was no explanation of how the settler's gun might have been fired. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ariel settlers, Rosenfeld was a nature lover and apparently was 
mapping a hiking route for residents when he was killed. Rosenfeld, who was 
raised in Washington, came to Israel in 1968 and had lived in Ariel for 18 
months. He was not married. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Fahad Fawzi Madi, a 27-year-old Palestinian suspected of 
collaborating with Israel, was found beaten and stabbed to death in the town of 
Khan Yunis in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab and Israeli news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Palestinian, Samir Mohammed Antiz, 19, was found dead in his tent at 
the Ketziot detention camp in the Negev desert, where he had been held without 
charge since February, an army spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel radio said Antiz apparently was killed by fellow prisoners who accused 
him of collaborating with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The army said police were investigating Madi's death and checking reports on 
Antiz's death. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a 34-year-old Palestinian postal worker from the West Bank town of Janin 
was hospitalized with two broken legs and a broken arm after he was beaten by 
masked Arabs who suspected him of collaborating with Israel, Arab reports said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 Palestinians suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities 
have been killed since the start of the 18-month Palestinian uprising against 
Israeli rule of the occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
Since the revolt began, a total of more than 500 Palestinians have been killed. 
Twenty-three Israelis also have died. 
</P>
<P>
About 70,000 Jews live in 131 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
alongside 1.7 million Palestinians. Relations between the two groups have 
worsened since the start of the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
In Gaza City, military authorities fired the director of the Israeli-run Shifa 
Hospital, accusing him of belonging to the mainstream Fatah faction of the 
outlawed PLO and of maintaining contacts with Fatah leaders in Jordan.

<P>
This country has officially changed its name in English to the Union of Myanmar 
and renamed the capital of Rangoon to Yangon, the state-run Working People's 
Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's law changing Burma's name, the nationality -- Burmese -- also was 
changed to Myanmar. The word for Burma and Burmese in the Burmese language are 
both pronounced Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
The names of states, towns and other geographical sites are to be written in 
English according to the Burmese pronunciation. Rangoon, for example, is to be 
written as Yangon, which is the Burmese pronunciation of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The latest change in the country's name, government officials say, is to better 
reflect Burma's ethnic diversity. The term Burma connotes Burman -- the 
dominant ethnic group in the country -- to the exclusion of ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The country is ruled by military officers who seized power in September.

U.S. ARMS TALKS ENVOY DEFENDS VERIFICATION STAND

Chief U.S. arms negotiator Richard R. Burt declared Tuesday that the Bush 
Administration's proposals to seek ways of verifying any reduction in strategic 
arms should accelerate steps toward such an agreement in the talks here. 
</P>
<P>
He denied that the Administration, after a long review of the START 
negotiations, had decided to slow progress toward a treaty in favor of pushing 
the conventional arms talks in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no higher priority" than the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, Burt 
said, echoing the statement President Bush made in Washington on Monday as the 
new round of talks began here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insists on No Linkage 
</P>
<P>
Burt, who comes to the arms post after serving as ambassador to West Germany, 
also insisted that there be no linkage between a START agreement and the 
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) of then-President Ronald Reagan, popularly 
known as "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not think the START agreement should be held hostage to agreements on 
space or our legal rights to SDI," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
This position placed the United States in direct opposition to the view 
enunciated Monday by the chief Soviet negotiator, Yuri K. Nazarkin, who 
indicated that agreement on limiting nuclear missiles is contingent on 
adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Under that agreement, the 
Soviet negotiators argue, the United States is not allowed to test or deploy 
weapons in space. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 sessions of bargaining over four years, the United States and the Soviet 
Union have completed an estimated 80% to 90% of a strategic arms treaty aimed 
at reducing the number of their intercontinental nuclear missiles by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emphasis on Verification 
</P>
<P>
After its review of the negotiations, the Bush Administration announced Monday 
that it wants to put new emphasis on finding ways to verify long-range nuclear 
arms cuts, perhaps even before completing a treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Burt said the United States is not presenting this emphasis on verification on 
a take-it-or-leave it basis. Rather, he said, the United States is seeking 
realistic verification procedures in order "to win the necessary political 
support" in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
He said that "verification is not the centerpiece of the talks but a 
component," adding: "We see this as expediting our purpose (to reach an 
accord), not to slow down the process but the opposite. We want to make as much 
progress as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Burt declined to estimate the time needed to reach an accord on a START treaty, 
declaring, "In this business, we don't talk about time frames."

BUSH APPEARS TO WIN SIGNIFICANT CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR MISSILE PLAN 
</P>

<P>
President Bush promised congressional leaders Tuesday that he will abandon the 
U.S. demand for a ban on mobile land-based missiles at strategic arms talks 
with the Soviet Union if he is assured of funding for two such weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared to win significant congressional support for the approach, partly 
because he is willing to divert $947 million more to the Midgetman program -- 
missiles with a single warhead and carried on truck-like vehicles -- that many 
Democrats favor. Bush said that such support will facilitate a new U.S. 
position at the arms talks in Geneva and remove a major obstacle to a new 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Influential congressmen, including Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee, said they were encouraged by Bush's commitment 
and by the additional Midgetman funds that were reprogrammed from other 
Pentagon spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Redirected Over Weekend 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney disclosed that the new funds, for the 1992-94 
period, were redirected over the weekend in a move that received virtually no 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
"That should satisfy the doubters," Cheney said at a breakfast meeting with 
reporters, in referring to congressmen and others who have expressed fear that 
the Pentagon (as well as congressional Republicans) is more committed to the 
competing MX mobile program -- missiles carrying 10 warheads and moved on the 
nation's rail tracks -- and would prefer to kill the Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
The Midgetman is more costly than the MX, which in a non-mobile form already 
has been deployed in silos, but experts believe that it would lend more 
stability to the nuclear balance between the two superpowers because it is not 
as big a target for a surprise attack. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush told the congressmen, "Don't 
pull the rug out from under us" on the two-missile program during the Geneva 
negotiations. The Soviets already have deployed both the SS-24, a 10-warhead 
rail-mobile missile, and the SS-25, a one-warhead road-mobile missile. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which does not now have either type of weapon deployed on 
roads or rails, previously had sought a ban on mobile missiles at the strategic 
arms negotiations. However, Bush has said that he would like to have both kinds 
of missiles in the U.S. arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
The President will not seek a ban on mobile weapons at the arms talks if 
Congress gives "assurances" of support for the two programs, Fitzwater said. 
This would remove one of the handful of roadblocks to the treaty that will 
reduce offensive strategic weapons by about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely what would constitute the congressional assurances that Bush wants 
was not spelled out, according to Aspin, who noted that the Defense Department 
budget will not come to a vote before late July in the House and is unlikely to 
be passed by Congress before October. 
</P>
<P>
An Administration official indicated, however, that the Administration could 
begin to move away gradually at Geneva from its proposed ban on mobile 
missiles, well before the funds are voted for the two-missile program. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, when he emerged from the White House, said that he was "very encouraged" 
by the President's presentation. "I think it helped clarify the seeming 
inconsistencies between arms control and force structure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn has called for a ban on multiple-warhead mobile missiles -- permitting 
single-warhead mobile missiles like the Midgetman. There was no indication that 
Bush would adopt that suggestion, however. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Administration was sharply criticized by Sen. 
Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) for its new focus on verification at the Strategic 
Arms Reduction Talks. 
</P>
<P>
Biden said he does not object to the several minor changes now being made in 
the U.S. position on the talks, but he suggested that the modifications might 
be diversionary or delaying tactics to hide the Administration's inability to 
make decisions on the major roadblocks still facing negotiators. Another 
possibility, he said, is that the changes are the result of "arbitrary 
'Bushification' of START," intended to put the Bush stamp on the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Administration will formally propose to the Soviets in Geneva 
acceleration in at least five areas, according to officials: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On-site inspection of Soviet SS-24 missile production facilities, 
comparable to the monitoring of a medium-range missile plant under the existing 
U.S.-Soviet treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On-site inspection to count the actual number of warheads on missiles. Some 
missiles will be counted as carrying fewer warheads than their maximum 
capability, such as eight rather than 12 for the Trident D-5 missile, and 
verification to guard against cheating will be required. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A ban on encoding of test flight data that is radioed from the missile. The 
Soviets already have agreed in principle to such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A ban on testing missiles to fly in a flat trajectory rather than a high, 
arching path. A "depressed" flight path would give less warning time of an 
incoming missile. Neither nation is currently testing such a trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A comprehensive exchange of information on how many strategic missiles each 
side has and where they are located. Both sides have agreed to such an exchange 
in the treaty itself. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has said that it wants to accelerate consideration of these 
measures to ensure that Congress will not reject a strategic arms treaty on 
verification grounds. "I wouldn't worry too much about the verification 
bogey-man up here," Biden told Secretary of State James A. Baker III during a 
hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

THOMAS A. POPE, 94; LAST SURVIVING ARMY WWI MEDAL OF HONOR WINNER

The U.S. Army's last surviving World War I Medal of Honor winner has died at 
the age of 94. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Pope, who lived in Woodland Hills, Calif., and Norwood Park, Ill., 
died last Wednesday in Hines Veterans Hospital near this small Illinois city. 
</P>
<P>
Although he saw action for only two days in World War I, Pope received 
commendations from four nations as well as the highest honor his own country 
could bestow. 
</P>
<P>
On July 4, 1918, he was entering his second month in France without seeing any 
action. Then a corporal, he spotted a machine-gun nest. Waving to his platoon 
to lie low, he charged the nest, killing the gunner before he could swing the 
machine gun toward the platoon. He then bayoneted another German soldier and 
held off eight more Germans, whom his men then took prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Before the sun set that Independence Day, his platoon had taken 100 prisoners. 
The next day he was gassed and sent back from the lines to an Army hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He became one of 95 U.S. soldiers to receive the Medal of Honor in the war and 
was the last surviving one. A Navy veteran is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
In 1923 he became president of the Combat Medal Men, an organization of 
servicemen who held the Medal of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Pope served as a contract officer and adviser to the Veterans 
Administration and was district foreman for the Cook County Highway Department. 
</P>
<P>
He will be buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

FLORIDA LAWMAKERS PASS GUN SAFETY BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Florida Legislature passed a bill making it illegal for gun owners to 
carelessly leave weapons around children. The gun-safety measure was sent to 
Gov. Bob Martinez after passing the Senate by a 26-6 margin and the House by 71 
to 39. Under the bill, adults who fail to secure a loaded weapon that is used 
by a minor in an accidental shooting could be charged with a felony and 
sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000. It would be a misdemeanor, 
punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine, if a minor displayed the 
gun or threatened someone with it. The legislation became the focus of national 
attention after three Florida young people were killed and four wounded in 
seven accidents earlier this month.

A California Highway Patrol officer in Los Banos has been fired for allegedly 
lying about her association with another officer who is charged with murdering 
his wife, authorities said. Laura Farmer, 27, was fired May 30 for "unbecoming 
conduct" and lying under oath during her testimony at a preliminary hearing for 
Robert Emmert. CHP Lt. Cal Minor said Farmer lied when she testified that she 
did not spend time alone with Emmert at another officer's house when the two 
were supposed to be on duty. Her testimony was contradicted by another officer 
who testified that Farmer and Emmert met on two occasions at her home while 
they were on duty and spent time alone together in a bedroom. Prosecutors 
allege that he murdered his wife last August to keep her from testifying 
against him on a spousal abuse charge.

Actress Jane Fonda spent the night alone on a mountain after becoming separated 
from her companions while backpacking in Sequoia National Park, park officials 
said. Fonda, 51, who was unharmed, did not panic when she realized she was 
lost, said her publicist, Steve Rivers. She wrapped herself in a blanket and 
ate a sandwich while she waited for help to arrive, he said. After Fonda's 
companions notified authorities that she was missing, a helicopter crew found 
Fonda on top of a mountain, officials said.

The House, backing President Bush's effort to reward reforms in Eastern Europe, 
passed a bill easing trade and investment restrictions for Poland and Hungary. 
The measure, passed by voice vote and sent to the Senate, would drop U.S. 
tariffs on some imports from Poland and authorize the Overseas Private 
Investment Corp. to guarantee U.S. investments in Poland and Hungary. The 
changes are to respond to recent reforms.

Hundreds of northern civil rights workers arrived in Mississippi to take part 
in memorial services commemorating the murders of James E. Chaney, Andrew 
Goodman and Michael H. Schwerner on June 21, 1964. An FBI investigation 
revealed Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney were killed by members of the Ku Klux 
Klan and their bodies were buried in an earthen dam near Philadelphia, Miss. 
The murders occurred while the three volunteers were trying to keep alive a 
voter registration drive in Neshoba County, where Philadelphia is located. The 
riders, predominantly blacks who had traveled 30 hours from New York and 
Pennsylvania, were scheduled to spend the night in Meridian, Miss.

UNESCO's governing body agreed on a compromise proposal allowing the general 
membership to decide later this year whether to allow the Palestine Liberation 
Organization to participate. The decision was made in Paris by the Executive 
Committee of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The 
proposal was watered down last week after representatives of seven Arab and 
nonaligned nations agreed to dilute their demand for admitting Palestine to 
UNESCO "as a member state." The final proposal makes no reference to Palestine 
as a state. Instead it recommends that members "make Palestine participate as 
closely as possible in the activities of UNESCO."

The Justice Department filed its first housing discrimination suit on behalf of 
the handicapped, accusing a Chicago suburb of illegally blocking construction 
of a home for the mentally retarded. The suit, filed in federal court in 
Chicago, charges the city of Chicago Heights, Ill., discriminated against the 
handicapped and seeks to allow the construction of a home for 15 mentally 
retarded adults. Last September, Congress amended the Fair Housing Act of 1968 
to bar discrimination against the handicapped and families, and to allow the 
government to collect damages for housing infractions. The Chicago Heights 
dispute began in May when the City Council rejected a special permit 
application from RFMS Inc., a Galesburg, Ill., company that specializes in 
developing homes for the retarded.

The State Department rejected a Nicaraguan offer to hold talks on improving 
relations, saying there can be no accommodation unless certain conditions are 
met, including free and fair elections under international supervision. 
President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua had said he was asking the archbishop of 
Managua, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, to go to Washington with a Sandinista 
proposal for opening talks on normalizing relations. But State Department 
spokesman Rudi Boone said that, in addition to democratic elections, Managua 
must hold a genuine dialogue with its opposition and end "its support for 
subversion in the region" before U.S.-Nicaraguan ties can be improved.

KLEIG LIGHTS, FANS, SECURITY: THE BATHYPE TAKES FLIGHT IN WILD WESTWOOD OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westwood has seen a lot of premieres in its time, but nothing on the scale of 
the debut of "Batman" Monday night. Klieg lights, fans in desperate need of 
showers after camping out for several nights, more fans up on the rooftops and 
enough security to foil a terrorist attack choked the streets for most of the 
night as cash registers hummed in nearby stores, continuing to rack up sales of 
Batmemorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Hype, thy name is Batman. 
</P>
<P>
The quasi-"Day of the Locust" scenario took place between the Village and the 
Bruin theaters, where two simultaneous screenings played for industry pros, 
press and celebrities. The camped-out fans, some in Bat costumes or Joker 
makeup, had been waiting for a limited number of first-come, first-served 
seats, but Warner Bros. took pity on those who didn't make it inside the first 
time and opened up both theaters for a second set of screenings. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most jaded Hollywoodites waited until the last minute to go into the 
theater, craning their necks to see Kim Basinger float by in her revealing 
black chiffon mini. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Whine and a Shrug 
</P>
<P>
"Will you please go inside?" whined a security officer before giving an 
exasperated shrug and walking off. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Batfans began to circulate through the theaters, asking stars for 
their autographs and snapping pictures (even of the screen when the Batlogo 
came up). They surrounded original Batman creator Bob Kane, causing an observer 
to note, "Eddie Murphy's right behind him and no one's paying attention to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
After the screening the Batfun was just beginning. Those lucky enough to have 
their names on The List (or crafty enough to know how to get past security) 
ended up at Twenty/20, the Century City disco palace so classy there are signs 
posted in the women's bathroom that read, "Only one person per stall." 
</P>
<P>
Crowds and sweat emerged in no time as people took to the dance floor, gyrating 
to the band Information Society, sound-track cuts, Top 40 tunes and Motown 
hits. Outside, the Batlogo projected eerily on a nearby high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purple and Private 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" sound-track star Prince took up residence in a corner booth and waited 
for people (including director Tim Burton) to come to him, while refusing 
photographers' attempts to capture the diminutive rocker on film. "Is Prince 
gonna play?" was the all-night buzz. He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Waiters in mime face dished out Along Came Mary's finger foods (pizza, dim sum, 
baby vegetables and beet and yam chips) to "Batman" stars Michael Keaton, Jack 
Nicholson, Kim Basinger and Robert Wuhl; producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber; 
"Batman" score composer Danny Elfman; Eddie Murphy; Joni Mitchell; photographer 
Herb Ritts; Valerie Bertinelli and Eddie Van Halen; screenwriter/director John 
Hughes; Guber-Peters exec Michael Besman; screenwriter Laurie Frank; Paul 
Rodriguez; Glenn Close; Barbra Streisand and Richard Baskin; Quincy Jones; 
Julianne Phillips and Mariel Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
Others at the screening included Sylvester Stallone, Louie Anderson, Don 
Johnson and Melanie Griffith, Randy Newman, Corey Feldman and Billy Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Keaton picked off wax that had somehow gotten on his pinstripe jacket 
and refused questions, saying: "You know what? I ain't working. I'm all done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing More Than Feelings 
</P>
<P>
Tim Burton admitted he was nervous. During the screening, he roamed in and out 
of the theater. "I'm always nervous," he said, adding that the audience's 
reactions "seemed to hit all the right spots." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Guber walked through the party with the same goofy grin he wore at the 
Oscars when "Rain Man" won best picture. 
</P>
<P>
Was the feeling the same? 
</P>
<P>
"One's the end of a process, tonight's the beginning," said Guber, who sported 
a "Help fight crime, wear your Batsuit at night" T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"Both films confronted innumerable obstacles -- this one took 10 years to 
make," he added. "This is the culmination of another dream. It's kind of like 
having a baby -- although I've never had a baby -- but it's like, 'Oh my God, 
it's on its own now.' " 
</P>
<P>
It sure is. Now he just has to wait for the sequel. . . . The Critics.

NEW AND USEFUL: QUICK FLAMES A CINCH FOR BARBECUE FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Back-yard barbecuers may be interested in Fire Flakes, nontoxic dry pine chips 
coated with paraffin that are billed as an alternative to starting the barbie 
with liquid charcoal lighters. The new curly wood flakes don't give off smelly 
fumes or add chemical taste to food. 
</P>
<P>
The bright orange chips are easy to use. Just take two handfuls and place them 
in the barbecue under the charcoal. Then ignite. Unlike most starters, Fire 
Flakes light the charcoal from underneath and typically take 15 minutes to help 
produce a strong fire, said company manager C. H. (Chuck) Aydelotte. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by March Industries of Fresno, Fire Flakes was purchased early this 
year by the Ortho Consumer Products Division of the Chevron Chemical Co. The 
product now is being distributed in the West and Midwest. An 18-ounce box, with 
a suggested retail of $2.19, can start 10 barbecue fires and can be used with 
any type of charcoal grill. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, Fire Flakes can be found at Albertsons, Alpha Beta, 
Boys, Hughes, Lucky, Vons and Vons Pavilions markets. For information on stores 
in your area that carry Fire Flakes, or for a free sample, write to Fire 
Flakes, 2445 S. Gearhart Ave., Fresno, Calif. 93725. 
</P>
<P>
Helmet for Bikers 
</P>
<P>
For mountain bicyclists, there's a lightweight safety helmet from Giro Sport 
Design Inc., the California company that developed the Prolight soft-cover 
cycling helmet and the Aerohead helmet for use in time-trial competitions. 
</P>
<P>
The Hammerhead, the new mountain biking helmet, has an aerodynamic design 
similar to Prolight. But Giro has added a thin, flexible polymer outer shell 
for more protection. "The slick covering prevents dings to the helmet and 
eliminates the possibility of fabric covers getting caught in branches when 
cutting through the brush," a manufacturer's representative explained. 
</P>
<P>
The Hammerhead weighs 8.5 ounces and features nine air vents. Its polished 
shell is red and white. It retails for $79.95 and is available in sizes XS, S, 
M and L. It can be purchased at Giro's 1,200 national distributors. For a 
dealer near you, call the company's toll-free number, (800) 543-4476, or write 
Giro Sport Design Inc., 2880 Research Park Drive, Soquel, Calif. 95073. 
</P>
<P>
Handy Music 
</P>
<P>
Looking for an unusual way to entertain and perhaps educate your children? You 
might want to try Musical Hands, gloves that play notes of the scale when the 
fingers are tapped or pressed on a hard surface. At $22.95 per pair, postpaid, 
they're certainly cheaper than a piano. 
</P>
<P>
"This toy stimulates a child's creativity as they produce musical tones right 
from their own fingertips," said Matthew Hesser, executive vice president of 
the Musical Hands distributing company in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The gloves, made of yellow and blue vinyl, are hand sewn and can be adjusted to 
fit most children ages 7 and older. Musical Hands are powered by six watch-size 
batteries, which are included with each pair, as is a song instruction booklet. 
To order, write Majon International, 23135 Samuel St., Suite 7, Torrance, 
Calif. 90505; phone (213) 791-1005. LYNN SIMROSS

CONSUMER VIEWS: CUSTOMER GIVES LITTLE CREDIT TO STORE IN CHARGE-CARD FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have enclosed a copy of a letter that I sent to the main office of 
the Broadway department store and which I will summarize: 
</P>
<P>
I have been a good customer of the Broadway for many years and have always paid 
my bills promptly. In late February, I received my bill showing charges of $959 
for women's clothes and shoes that I did not purchase. I called the credit 
office and was told the mistake would be rectified in a week. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, I was called on a Sunday and asked if this was the residence 
of So-and-So, a woman. When I told them they were mistaken, they told me that a 
woman of that name had signed two sales checks at Broadway's Del Amo store. My 
charge card was not used in the transaction. At that point I assumed that fraud 
was involved and the amount would be taken off my account until an 
investigation was launched. I was told that the charges would be "frozen" and I 
would not have to pay the monthly charges on the amount of the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
I was told that if I signed a "release" paper, the charges would be "credited" 
to my account. I don't see how the store can "credit" someone's account for 
something the customer was not responsible for. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway people also referred to the bill as the "disputed" amount. I was 
not "disputing" the amount, but denouncing it. After it was determined that I 
was in no way at fault, all references to these charges should have been 
removed from the bill immediately. 
</P>
<P>
This whole matter has caused me great mental anguish. I have been more than 
willing to cooperate with the Broadway in any investigation of my possible 
personal involvement in this matter. Instead, I have spent two months 
attempting to expunge this from my record. 
</P>
<P>
After I have heard the Broadway's explanation of how my number came to be used 
without my card, I will then determine whether to close my account with them. 
Is the Broadway compelled to give a customer the details of the outcome of a 
fraud case? -- L.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You've been through the mill, all right, and the Broadway regrets that 
it took as long as it did to clear these charges. The timing was such, 
apparently, that the clearance missed the first billing cycle, and so it wasn't 
until May 8, Teri Loud, senior manager of account services for the Broadway, 
says, that the thing was completed and that a letter of apology went out to 
you. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there is a matter of semantics -- language -- involved here. The 
law requires that this fraudulent charge of $959 has to be referred to as a 
"disputed" amount -- a fine point that keeps it on neutral ground while the 
investigation is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
And using the phrase "credit to" your account is, after all, just another way 
of saying "wipe it off" your account. At no time during the investigation, Loud 
adds, were you required to make any payments on the fraudulent purchases, no 
finance charges were imposed and, of course, you were never shown as being 
delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
How the sales were made without the use of your charge card is one of those 
sticky situations that retailers encounter constantly, because a distressing 
number of shoppers every day walk away from home without their charge cards. 
Should the stores make the customer go home and retrieve it? From an image 
standpoint, this would be a little bit like hiccuping at a wake. 
</P>
<P>
"So, we have the clerk call the credit office and try to confirm the account by 
asking the customer a couple of questions that will establish some identity," 
Loud adds. "Ask for an address, a telephone number or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, as your case so graphically proves, this is a country mile wide of 
being foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
"When something like this happens," Loud continues, "we dig out the actual 
sales bills that the person making the purchase signed, ask the customer to 
examine them and then sign an affidavit of forgery. Then we remove the charge 
from the customer's bill, set up a new account number and send the customer a 
letter of apology." 
</P>
<P>
The issuing of a new account number is fairly standard procedure, based on the 
Broadway's suspicion that if whoever pulled this scam knows enough about you 
(address, telephone number or what-not) to forge the sales slip in the first 
place, that person might also know your account number. So it's a double 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
"Credit card frauds like this," Loud says, "are at their highest peak right now 
in about four years -- and that seems to be the cycle, about four years. It's 
unfortunately a normal situation in retailing, and most fraud involves either 
stolen or counterfeit credit cards or a stolen account number." 
</P>
<P>
And no, neither the Broadway nor any other retailer will tell you what its 
fraud investigation uncovers. And there are two understandable reasons for 
this. 
</P>
<P>
One, today's scam artists, Loud admits, "have gotten extremely sophisticated," 
and for the department store to explain to you how the swindle worked simply 
spreads information on the store's internal operations, which are, obviously, 
already too well known to too many people. 
</P>
<P>
The second reason, Loud reluctantly admits, is that occasionally a scam like 
this will involve someone on the inside. And this is a bit of internal 
housecleaning that no retailer wants to bare its soul about. 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't blame the Broadway for this. It did take a little longer than it 
should have (the investigation turned out to be more involved than normal, Loud 
says), but by now you've received the store's apology, the charge is off your 
account and you've got a fresh account number.

THE ARTIST WHO PLACED DEMOCRACY ON HER CIVIC CENTER PEDESTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was in Boston on the weekend of the Beijing massacre that Los Angeles artist 
Tom Van Sant decided to create a replica of the "Goddess of Democracy" 
bulldozed by Chinese troops in Tien An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
"At 11 p.m. I drove down Massachusetts Avenue, and 400 Chinese students were 
standing on the steps at MIT," Van Sant said. 
</P>
<P>
Flying to Los Angeles the next day, he sketched the statue that he and others 
erected on a Civic Center footbridge a few days later: "I bought a Time 
magazine with a picture of the 'Goddess' and designed it on the plane." 
</P>
<P>
The 23-foot-tall monument remains atop the bridge. Though installed June 12 
without a city permit, the statue has won support from city officials who 
helped have it anchored down temporarily and voted Monday to aid in its 
relocation next week to City Hall's Spring Street entrance. Officials say it 
may stay there for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I get asked why we did it," said Van Sant, who erected the wood and Styrofoam 
statue with other members of the local chapter of Artists Equity Assn., a 
national visual artists service organization. 
</P>
<P>
"People all across our country feel powerless (over the Chinese crisis), and 
this dramatic imagery these Chinese kids came up with gives us an opportunity 
to be empowered in some way." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't every day that Van Sant makes socially conscious art. But the statue 
is not a far cry from his other efforts of late. 
</P>
<P>
The artist recently formed Eyes on Earth, a nonprofit corporation for 
environmental research, education and programming that is about to unveil its 
main undertaking, the Van Sant Geosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Working with a 30-person team that includes scientists and computer wizards, 
Van Sant said he is creating a computerized 24-foot globe that uses space 
satellites, lasers and video to display images of environmental activity 
anywhere on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
"Along with freedom of people, custodianship of our planet is the most 
important issue of our time," he said. "As an artist, I enjoy contributing to 
these issues." 
</P>
<P>
Van Warren, a computer graphics technician at Pasadena's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory working on the Geosphere, said a prototype should be ready in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the forefront of technology and the forefront of art coming together 
to produce a tangible symbol of environmental awareness and global 
consciousness," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant, 58, has married art and technology before, producing elaborate kites 
and a giant eye made of mirrors reflecting sunlight to satellites. Best known 
for these sorts of popular, off-beat projects, Van Sant is not well known in 
more established fine-arts circles. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Reiss, an artist and art department chairman at Claremont Graduate 
School, said he had never heard of Van Sant: "No, the name is not ringing any 
bells." 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant has designed several conventional public works in Southern California 
and Hawaii, however. His commissions include wall reliefs at the Inglewood City 
Hall, banners at Los Angeles International Airport and the bridge on which the 
"Goddess" now stands. 
</P>
<P>
One public project met with an unfortunate end. A 1967 mural in the downtown 
AT&amp;T Center was covered up when new owners remodeled the building, Van Sant 
said. He fought that action in court with a $5.5-million lawsuit; the parties 
recently settled it for an undisclosed amount.

ABC RADIO STANDS BEHIND ABORTION SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a rare move for a major radio network, ABC will broadcast a special program 
on abortion today with no national advertising. The network was forced to foot 
the bill when national advertisers refused to buy commercial spots on the 
hourlong program hosted by Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
"We just kept getting rejections (from potential sponsors)," said Louis 
Severine, senior vice president and sales director for ABC Radio. "They just 
came right out and said they didn't want to touch it because of the 
explosiveness of the subject matter." 
</P>
<P>
Six national spots on the program, the first in an occasional series called the 
"American Agenda Radio Special," have gone unfilled, said Susan Storms, a 
spokeswoman for ABC Radio, the nation's largest radio network. But KABC-AM 
(790) in Los Angeles reported having no trouble selling local advertising in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
The show, live from Washington, will discuss the impending U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling that could reaffirm or overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that 
legalized abortion. Walters will moderate a debate with panelists Molly Yard, 
president of the National Organization for Women; David J. Andrews, executive 
vice president of Planned Parenthood; Judy Brown, president of the American 
Life League, and Michael Schwartz of the Free Congress Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be a case where advertisers have just assumed that they would get 
unpleasant reactions from one side or the other," said the show's executive 
producer, Jim Farley. "But this is a straight-down-the-middle, fair, balanced 
look at the issues. When you get anything that smacks of 'We can't touch this' 
in the news area, it's scary." 
</P>
<P>
Farley said the advertisers' reaction has doubly surprised him because he 
thought the presence of Walters as program moderator would attract sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got a track record that says, 'This is a fair, balanced and respected 
interviewer,' " Farley said. "She isn't going to get in there and take a 
viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 stations have signed up to carry the program, Storms said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why ABC Radio was going ahead with the broadcast despite the lack of 
national sponsors, Severine said: "We had made the commitment to do it. We felt 
that the subject matter is something of national importance. It's expensive, 
but that's the cost of doing business." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say how much the broadcast would cost ABC. 
</P>
<P>
KABC-AM, which will broadcast the program at 11 a.m., sold the six local 
commercial spots allotted to it, according to David Crowle, the station's 
manager of creative services. 
</P>
<P>
The program's topic did not scare away local advertisers because most of those 
sponsors are accustomed to hearing hotly debated issues on the talk-radio 
station, KABC general manager George Greene said.

EVANS' SUCCESS CAME EARLY; 
</P>
<P>
CAREER EPITOMIZED HOLLYWOOD DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS and MICHAEL CIEPLY, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In many ways, Robert Evans' life epitomizes the Hollywood dream. A professional 
radio performer by the age of 11, he won a featured role in a movie at the age 
of 20 and was head of production at Paramount Pictures at 36. 
</P>
<P>
As a kid, he read about the young MGM production genius Irving Thalberg. In his 
first film role, in "The Man of a Thousand Faces," he portrayed Thalberg. When 
he was 36, he became Thalberg. 
</P>
<P>
During his 10 years as Paramount's production chief, Evans helped bring the 
studio from eighth to first place in the rankings of studio revenues, 
developing such hit projects as "The Odd Couple," "Love Story," "Rosemary's 
Baby," "Serpico," "The Longest Yard" and "The Godfather." When he left 
Paramount in 1974, he independently produced the critical and commercial hit 
"Chinatown," then the Dustin Hoffman thriller "Marathon Man" and was at the 
very top of a very big game. 
</P>
<P>
But there was only one hit in his next five films. And financial and personal 
setbacks -- he was convicted in 1980 of cocaine possession -- culminated in 
court testimony Tuesday that linked him to the contract killing of Long Island 
impresario Roy Radin in the "Cotton Club" murder case, leaving Evans one of the 
least envied men in Hollywood, even by those who like him and have worked with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"To those of us who knew him (at Paramount) and knew what a good-spirited 
person he was, it's a terrible sadness," Peter Bart, a film executive under 
Evans at the studio, said after Tuesday's court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the arc of the 58-year-old Evans' career, Bart said: "Bob always had 
a premonition that his career would peak before he was 50 and fade down hill. 
He lived by it. He was haunted by it." 
</P>
<P>
"Cotton Club" was to have been the crowning jewel of Evans' career and a 
comeback of sorts. Three of his previous four films ("Players," "Popeye" and 
"Black Sunday") had been big disappointments and a remake of "Chinatown" -- 
which he planned to direct, as well as star in -- had stalled. 
</P>
<P>
But "Cotton Club" quickly toppled into an abyss, becoming a runaway production 
that exhausted most of Evans' own fortune, forcing him to look for white knight 
investors to cover the growing budget. 
</P>
<P>
There is some break in the clouds for Evans. "Two Jakes," the long-awaited 
sequel to "Chinatown," is in production, with Jack Nicholson starring and 
directing. The film will be released at Christmas for Academy Award 
consideration and will go into national release early next year. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, Evans sold his 16-room French Regency home on North Beverly 
Drive, just above the Beverly Hills Hotel, to property investor and neighbor 
Tony Murray. Sources said Evans sold the house to Murray on the condition that 
he be allowed to continue living there as a renter. Evans did not return 
several phone calls Tuesday from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
According to real estate records, Evans bought the house in 1965 for about 
$500,000; he reportedly sold it to Murray for more than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although Evans got off to a fast start as an actor -- he made his film debut 
playing a sailor in "Mildred Pierce" -- it was his development of "Love Story" 
that friends say became his personal and career turning point. The adaptation 
of Erich Segal's novel was a huge box office success and Evans ended up 
marrying its star, Ali McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
But Evans was arrested in New York in 1980, along with two others, on charges 
of possession of five ounces of cocaine that they had bought from a federal 
undercover agent. The charges were reduced to a misdemeanor after plea 
bargaining and Evans was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Evans was in court trying to maintain control over "The 
Cotton Club." Edward Doumani, one of the investors trying to wrest control of 
the production from Evans, testified that the producer was unable to perform 
his day-to-day duties because of "drug addiction." 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled in Evans' favor in that civil case.

EVANS LINKED FOR FIRST TIME IN COURT TO RADIN'S MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A witness in the "Cotton Club" preliminary hearing testified Tuesday that a 
defendant in the case told him that former Paramount Pictures production chief 
Robert Evans and a reputed Florida cocaine dealer were the two people 
responsible for ordering the 1983 murder of New York theatrical producer Roy 
Radin. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Evans branded the testimony "an outrageous lie." 
</P>
<P>
William Rider, a brother-in-law of Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, 
answered "yes" to each of Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn's questions regarding 
secretly taped conversations with one of the accused killers, William Molony 
Mentzer, during the fifth week of the Radin murder hearing in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Mr. Mentzer indicate to you that anyone else was involved in the killing 
of Mr. Radin?" Conn asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Greenberger and Robert Evans," answered Rider, referring to the producer 
and to Karen DeLayne Greenberger, the reputed narcotics dealer and a defendant 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Did he say what their involvement was?" Conn asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, essentially that they paid for the contract," Rider said. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who is currently co-producing a sequel to "Chinatown" called "Two 
Jakes," could not be reached for comment. Evans was called as the prosecution's 
first witness, but refused to answer a single question. On advice of his 
defense attorney, Robert Shapiro, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that Bob Evans did not pay for it," Shapiro said in a phone 
interview Tuesday. "Any statement by anyone to the contrary is an outrageous 
lie." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro and Evans have maintained that the former Hollywood wunderkind would be 
willing to testify if Conn would guarantee Evans immunity from prosecution, but 
the prosecutor has never ruled him out as a suspect in the case. On Tuesday, 
Conn again refused to rule Evans out as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob (Evans) is getting killed in the press and he's totally innocent," Shapiro 
said. "We can't even cross-examine." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rider's statement implicating Evans marked the first time that 
testimony in open court linked the producer to Radin's murder, reports of 
Rider's claims first surfaced last year. The Times reported several weeks after 
the arrests of the four Radin co-defendants that Rider had told investigators 
that both Greenberger and Evans were involved in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Rider, who is being paid $3,000 a month by the district attorney under terms of 
the Witness Protection Program, claims that he fears for his life and the 
safety of his family as a result of his cooperation with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during Tuesday's testimony, Rider disclosed that he has a 
concealed weapon permit and carries a gun for protection. Judge Patti Jo McKay 
called a short recess during which Rider and his two Sheriff's Department 
bodyguards disappeared into a side room briefly, apparently to determine that 
Rider was not carrying a gun in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taped Conversations 
</P>
<P>
Rider told of a series of surreptitiously taped conversations that he had with 
Mentzer and two other suspects, Robert Lowe and Robert Deremer, from May 
through September of last year. In those conversations, which Rider turned over 
to sheriff's homicide investigators, Mentzer boasted of killing Radin and doing 
so at the behest of Greenberger and Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"Radin was trying to be . . . a movie producer," Mentzer told Rider on one of 
the tapes played during Tuesday's court session. "He was selling drugs, he was 
selling drugs and, ya know, he did more than he sold, I think. And, uh, ya 
know, when he met Bob Evans, ya know, and Elaine Jacobs (Greenberger) 
introduced him to Bob Evans -- at that time Bob Evans was the biggest producer 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, when Radin was driven to a desolate canyon in northeast Los Angeles 
County and shot to death, Evans was, indeed, one of the most successful film 
makers in Hollywood history, boasting a string of hits that began during his 
decade as Paramount production chief and included "Love Story," "Chinatown," 
both "Godfather" films and "Rosemary's Baby." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Meeting 
</P>
<P>
It was his independent venture -- "The Cotton Club" -- with director Francis 
Ford Coppola and screenwriters William Kennedy and Mario Puzo in 1983 that 
brought about Evans' association with Radin and Greenberger. 
</P>
<P>
Following a string of box office failures, Evans was having trouble coming up 
with the financing for his story of the notorious 1930s Harlem nightclub. 
According to testimony, he met Greenberger through a limousine driver who, in 
turn, introduced Evans to Radin. Radin subsequently signed a deal with Evans 
promising to raise $35 million to make "Cotton Club." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe Greenberger hired Mentzer, Lowe and Alex Lamota Marti to 
kill Radin because the 33-year-old Long Island producer cut Greenberger out of 
the movie deal.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW AIDS CASES SET RECORD IN MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were 244 confirmed cases of AIDS in Los Angeles County in May, health 
authorities reported Tuesday. It was the highest monthly count since the county 
began keeping statistics five years ago, but no immediate reason was given for 
the figure. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly figure is up sharply from the 192 cases reported in April and tops 
the previous monthly high of 229 cases reported in March. Of the 244 new cases, 
six involved children. Another 210 cases were still pending investigation. 
</P>
<P>
As of May, there were 7,173 confirmed AIDS cases in the county, including 66 
that involve children. The death rate is at 65%, accounting for 4,651 deaths 
through the end of May.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALIENS URGED TO FINISH PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several immigration officials, joined by U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service Commissioner Alan C. Nelson, Tuesday issued yet another plea for 
eligible aliens to complete educational requirements under the second phase of 
the landmark national amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
If they do not, the aliens will become illegal again, the officials said at a 
Los Angeles news conference. At present, about a third of the estimated 1 
million illegals who signed up in greater Los Angeles during the amnesty 
program's first phase have sought to complete the educational components -- 
know-ledge of the English language and U.S. history -- required under the 
second phase, which expires in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Of special concern are an estimated 20,000 temporary residency cards -- granted 
under the first phase of the program -- that have not yet been picked up. 
"That's the tragedy of this whole thing -- to have spent the money and become a 
temporary resident and then let that expire and become illegal again," said INS 
Western Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VICTIM SLAMS DOOR IN GUNMAN'S FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attempt by an armed robber in Lakewood to steal a man's car was foiled when 
the victim slammed his door shut in the suspect's face, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The robber had knocked on the front door of a house on Hyter Avenue at 10:30 
p.m. Monday and was answered by the resident, George Wilder, 50, Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Deputy Dan Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
With the door open, the robber pointed a sawed-off shotgun at Wilder and 
demanded the keys to his car, Cox said. Instead, Wilder slammed the door in the 
robber's face. The robber fired a round through the door but missed Wilder, Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hubert Rouse, a California Highway Patrol officer who was off duty and lives 
nearby, confronted the gunman and two alleged accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
The three men fled after Rouse fired a shot, but deputies later captured the 
alleged accomplices -- Troy Black, 27, of Lakewood, and Dana Smith, 21, of Los 
Angeles, and booked them for investigation of robbery. The gunman was still at 
large.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN WOULD LOWER WATER BILLS OF POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved a motion Tuesday that will reduce the 
water bills of about 40,000 low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction, which would apply only to customers of the city's water lifeline 
program, is meant to offset a 27% increase in sewer service fees scheduled to 
go into effect next month. 
</P>
<P>
The amount not paid by customers with reduced rates will be subsidized by other 
customers, who will be charged about 7 cents more a month, said officials. The 
measure, initially proposed by Councilwoman Gloria Molina, must now be approved 
by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Although the water lifeline program, like several other special rate plans, is 
currently only offered to the elderly and disabled, the council instructed the 
chief administrative officer to study the possibility of such reductions being 
expanded to include all the city's low-income residents.

THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
HISTORIC GORMAN INSTITUTION IS TINY BUT IT BOASTS ITS OWN GHOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a stirring recording of "Pomp and Circumstance" filled the school 
auditorium, three eighth-graders in blue gowns and mortarboards marched 
solemnly toward the tiny stage. "Ladies and gentlemen," intoned Supt. Wesley 
Thomas, "I'd like to present the Class of 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Even for Gorman School, this was a sparse crop of graduates. Last year, it had 
six. 
</P>
<P>
Located in a small Spanish-style building 65 miles north of Los Angeles, the 
Gorman School District is, with 49 pupils and only one school, the smallest 
public school system in Los Angeles County. The rural school also is probably 
the only campus in Southern California, if not the state, where deer graze on 
the athletic field and where students and teachers claim a ghost haunts the 
halls. 
</P>
<P>
Few districts could make such demands on an administrator as Thomas, who 
identified himself as "superintendent, principal, teacher of the junior high 
and part-time bus driver." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homespun Atmosphere 
</P>
<P>
But the homespun atmosphere of Gorman's school, which celebrated its 50th 
commencement in its present home last week, may soon change forever. 
</P>
<P>
The Ralphs family, a pioneer Gorman clan best known for the supermarket chain, 
wants to build 150 homes on the hills west of the school. If the tract is 
approved, the district will have to buy classroom trailers or perhaps build a 
new school, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposed housing tract would render the old three-room school 
building obsolete, the influx of new students also could save the financially 
strapped district from extinction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the rapidly growing school districts 30 miles to the south in the Santa 
Clarita Valley, Gorman officials watched their enrollment slip from 63 to 49 
over the last year. School funding is tied to daily attendance, and extra 
students will funnel extra dollars into a district that squeezes by on a 
$240,000 yearly budget, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Set of Doors 
</P>
<P>
Since March, the superintendent has driven five students to and from school in 
the family car because it was cheaper than running a second school bus. The 
major capital improvement this year, Thomas said, was a new set of doors. 
</P>
<P>
But adversity is not new to Gorman School. Ruth Ralphs, a school board member, 
said the isolated district has learned to be resourceful. "When you're out 
here, you have to be survivors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The first school in the area started around 1906 when children gathered at a 
local ranch house for lessons. Later sites included a cabin, a prefabricated 
building and the living room of Ralphs family matriarch Mary Ralphs. The 
school's present home was built in 1938 by the federal Works Progress 
Administration and the first group of eighth-graders graduated the next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman School has never been prone to swift change. One bus driver served 35 
years. Mary Ralphs, in a profound example of the powers of incumbency, stayed 
on the school board 57 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 1970s were especially difficult for the tiny district. In 1971, the 
Legislature narrowly killed a bill that would have eliminated school districts 
with fewer than 50 students. Funding plummeted after the property tax-cutting 
Proposition 13 passed in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
But the school survived. The district hired mainly part-time teachers and 
rotated their schedules to save on salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funds for Computers 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult," Ruth Ralphs said. Somehow, money was found for 16 
computers and all grades, from kindergarten to eighth, receive computer 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the school has four part-time teachers, two full-time teachers, a cook, 
a secretary and three aides. Kindergartners join first- and second-graders in 
one room while the middle grades share another. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth, seventh and eighth grades meet in what students call "the big room," 
which serves as auditorium, classroom and -- on snowy winter days -- a 
gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Since several grades meet in one room at once, teachers sometimes call on older 
children to help younger students. "Just like a one-room school," said Walter 
Hanson, a regular substitute teacher at Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
Some students thrive on the extra attention. Since enrolling in Gorman School 
three years ago, "I got a lot better grades," said Christina Arnburg, one of 
last week's graduates. "Over here, they help you with what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, Arnburg will attend high school in Bakersfield. Other graduates, 
who live closer to the Antelope Valley, will attend secondary school in Quartz 
Hill, near Lancaster. Both are about 40 miles away. The students at Gorman live 
throughout northwestern Los Angeles County, and the district's school bus 
covers 96 miles each day. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, itself, is not so much a town as a notion. The Grapevine truck stop off 
Interstate 5 includes four gas stations, a cafe, a fast-food restaurant, a bar, 
liquor store, real estate office and a motel. And that's about it. 
</P>
<P>
The county recorder lists 65 registered voters there, 40 of whom are 
Republican. Other than the school Christmas pageant and graduation, there are 
no civic activities to bring the Gorman community together. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Gorman Ghost 
</P>
<P>
But the most intriguing feature of the school is the Gorman ghost, supposedly 
the spirit of a girl accidently run over by a tractor driven by her father. 
"She was buried underneath what is now the stage," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
With familial affection, teachers and students say the ghost is just another 
part of the school, supposedly opening and shutting doors and cupboards. She 
allegedly is musical. "The piano plays," said Catherine Van, a reading 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
To district secretary Diane Phillips, the ghost is a blithe spirit. "It's a 
good ghost," she insisted, "as long as you're here for a good reason."

WOMAN GETS PROBATION FOR MAKING TORTURE FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hesperia woman who produced and distributed films in which she tortured her 
husband pleaded guilty Tuesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court to five 
misdemeanor obscenity counts. 
</P>
<P>
Such plea bargains are unusual in pornography cases, in which attorneys often 
cite First Amendment rights of free expression, but "the nature and subject 
matter of the films make it extremely difficult to defend," said Stuart 
Goldfarb, lawyer for Anita (Mistress Anne) Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"These films were not simulated," Goldfarb said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Carol Boas Goodson gave Murray, 45, a suspended sentence of one year in 
Los Angeles County Jail and placed her on five years' probation on condition 
that she get out of the adult film industry and donate $10,000 to the Los 
Angeles Police Department's DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program, 
"helping to erase, rather than add to, some of the ugliness in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Murray sold her hourlong films for $100 apiece through the mail, said Deputy 
City Atty. Michael Guarino, acting as a special assistant to the U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Search warrants have been served on two New York companies that allegedly also 
distributed Murray's movies and federal charges against the firms are being 
considered, Guarino said. The search warrants are sealed because the 
investigation has not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the movies feature Murray, who stands 6 feet tall and weighs 170 
pounds, inflicting punishment by various methods, some scatological, upon her 
5-foot-9, 160-pound husband, Richard Henry Lichy, 51, Guarino said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police saw Murray's catalogue, which was available at a local 
newsstand, and ordered five films with such titles as "The Bizarre Debut of 
Mistress Anne Murray" and "Leather Domina." 
</P>
<P>
When a search warrant was served at Murray's home in the San Bernardino County 
desert in January, authorities found the couple, in matching negligees, baking 
a cake, Guarino said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's income from the film business was about $50,000 a year, Guarino said, 
though she sold her master tapes to other companies, which allegedly made much 
more. The movies were sold in New York, the District of Columbia and Oklahoma, 
as well as in California, Guarino said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple sat quietly in the courtroom Tuesday. The defendant offered brief 
responses to the judge's questions and told a reporter, "I have nothing to say 
to you."

IMMENSE, ORNATE NEW CIVIC CENTER BLOSSOMING IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's bigger than Union Station, bigger than the Sports Arena and when its 
pieces are added up, it's bigger than almost every other public building in 
Southern California. What is it? A hint: The parking structure can hold as many 
as 553 Mercedes-Benz convertibles. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's the new Beverly Hills Civic Center, now taking shape over 10 acres 
and spanning Rexford Drive, at a cost of $83 million. Even Mayor Max Salter 
says the structure is, well, a bit much. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that it is overbuilt somewhat," Salter said. 
"But as against piddling around for another 20 years until you've finally 
decided on something, I'd opt for what we have. Quality is remembered long 
after cost is forgotten, and that's what people should remember." 
</P>
<P>
Made up of city offices, a library, a firehouse, a police station, a jail and 
parking facilities, the complex totals nearly 600,000 square feet. By 
comparison, there is 507,715 square feet of usable floor area in Los Angeles 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long in Coming 
</P>
<P>
The new civic center has been long in coming. There was a ground-breaking 
ceremony in 1985, and the project was originally scheduled for completion in 
1987. It was held up for redesign after a theater and a cafeteria were dropped 
to save money, and delayed again after the discovery of asbestos in the walls 
of the existing library building. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the work is finished: The parking structure and the fire station, 
complete with two shiny brass poles, have been in business for two years. 
</P>
<P>
But the police station, library and a pedestrian bridge over Rexford Drive are 
still under construction, and work is also under way at the 58-year-old City 
Hall, a Mexican baroque landmark that sticks out above the low-rises on Santa 
Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Salter said he is determined to move into his new office by December. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day I take out the whip and give them a few lashes here and there," he 
joked. "We're going to have a sensational City Hall when it's all completed, 
and it's going to serve the people for the next 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the old City Hall building, which also housed a courthouse, police 
station and morgue when it opened in 1931, the City Council chamber has been 
expanded by removing a small room that was once used for study sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Craftsmen from A. T. Heinsbergen &amp; Co., the same firm that created the 
elaborate ceiling in 1931, are about to restore the gilded paint job and 
duplicate its floral motif in the extension and in the old courtroom down the 
hall, where it was hidden for decades by a false ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council chamber, which once seated 80, will now have room for 130. 
Two-way audio-visual links with other meeting rooms will enable as many as 400 
people to take part in debates. 
</P>
<P>
Workers are about to restore the colorful tile work and reapply gold leaf to a 
knob atop the cupola of the eight-story tower, but A. T. Heinsbergen, son of 
the man who did the original job, said he wanted no part of that assignment. 
</P>
<P>
The gold work is especially tricky, he said. The gold leaf is just one 
two-thousandth of an inch thick and can easily blow away. The glue that holds 
it on has to be applied the night before and it can be too sticky or too dry, 
depending on the humidity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't ask me to do it and if they did I wouldn't have, because my dad 
told me he lost his shirt on it in 1931," Heinsbergen said. Another contractor, 
Pacific Coast Painting, has taken on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Building codes were considerably less stringent when the old City Hall was 
built, but tests have shown it to be structurally sound, said John Hartsock, 
the consultant who is managing the construction project for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The architectural details -- leaves, flowers and other delicate forms cast into 
concrete from hand-carved wooden molds -- were also a testimony to the 
workmanship of those days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the building's interior walls, made of hollow clay tiles for fire safety, 
had to go for fear they might collapse in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Across Rexford Drive, the new police station, complete with the latest in 
communications equipment, full-scale locker rooms for officers of both sexes, 
10,000 square feet for evidence storage, 35 individual jail cells and a firing 
range in the basement, will finally match the image of the Beverly Hills cop 
shop depicted in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
"From our perspective, the talk about this thing being too large doesn't hold 
water," said Police Capt. Bill Hunt. "We were so cramped (before) that it 
definitely impacted our ability to provide service." 
</P>
<P>
City officials are just as proud of the library, which has been gutted and 
revamped to make way for video facilities, an electronic book retrieval system 
and a two-story-high reading room illuminated by skylights. 
</P>
<P>
"If you remember the old library and its cramped quarters, this will be what 
the public sees the most, and it'll be a show-stopper," said Howard Rattner, 
city economic development manager. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Charles Moore used three oval courtyards to link the two city blocks 
that make up the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The palm-lined courtyards are strung together on a diagonal line, with traffic 
flowing through a central ellipse on Rexford Drive. The two smaller ovals will 
be for pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wonderful Solution' 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was a particularly wonderful solution to what seemed to be an 
intractable problem," said Eugene J. Johnson, a professor of art at Williams 
College in Williamstown, Mass., who has written about Moore's work. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a professor at the University of Texas and at UCLA who is involved on 
other projects in cities from Santa Fe, N.M., to Eugene, Ore., was not 
available for an interview, but one of his associates acknowledged the debt to 
an Italian master. 
</P>
<P>
"Borromini is an Italian baroque architect whose work Charles (Moore) is very 
fond of," said Stephen Harby,c) Moore's design manager for the Beverly Hills 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's vision of a Civic Center was picked from a field of six finalists in a 
competition in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faithful to Vision 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dimster, a professor of architecture at USC, acknowledged that Moore was 
faithful to the vision of the original builders, but asked, "Is it still 
appropriate to do so in today's context?" 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm trying to raise is, if that display of values for a city hall is an 
appropriate one," he said. "In some ways, to have a building that is very 
ornate and very opulent, you could structure an argument that it might not be 
the best display of service to the community."

WIND EROSION ADDS TO DROUGHT DAMAGE

Wind erosion over the winter inflicted its worst damage in three decades on the 
Great Plains, ripping away topsoil on over 14.3 million acres, the Agriculture 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
"The big reason for the increase is the drought," soil conservation service 
chief Wilson Scaling said Monday. "Not only was it dry but it meant we went 
into the wind erosion season with inadequate vegetative cover and little 
residue to protect the soil from blowing." 
</P>
<P>
He said the last time the May-November wind erosion season wrought so much 
damage on the Great Plains was when 15 million acres were damaged in 1954-55, 
when the department first began to keep such records. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst day of the season, winds of up to 80 m.p.h. swooped through Kansas 
on March 14, damaging 4.8 million acres. Kansas was the hardest-hit state, with 
a total of more than 5 million acres damaged. It was a record for the state. 
North Dakota was second with 2.3 million acres harmed and Texas followed with 
almost 2 million acres damaged.

Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey, his dream of an overall majority 
shattered in last week's election, decided to meet with all opposition parties 
in a bid to extricate Ireland from the political crisis he created. Haughey 
called the election in an attempt to win outright control of Parliament. He 
ended up worse off and is now six seats short of a majority. After a Cabinet 
meeting to discuss the political impasse, Haughey said he will meet his foes, 
whose backing he needs to become prime minister for the fourth time when 
Parliament returns June 29.

San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery said he will ask the City Council to increase the 
reward to $25,000 for information leading to the capture of the killer of a 
16-year-old Japanese exchange student. A private organization called Crime 
Stoppers has already offered a $5,000 reward in the death of Ai Toyoshima, who 
was shot in the chest when she got off a bus on Friday. "This is the type of 
mindless, senseless violence that cannot be tolerated in our city or our 
society," the mayor said.

Both smokers and nonsmokers favor the ban of smoking on short-haul airline 
flights, an anti-smoking group said. The tobacco industry said the group's 
survey of 27,000 passengers at 66 airports in 33 states was flawed. The 
American Assn. of Respiratory Care announced the results of its April survey at 
a Washington news conference with several House members who said they would 
support legislation to extend the ban to all flights or at least make the 
present limited ban permanent. The law bans smoking on flights of two hours or 
less until April, 1990. The survey results showed a bare majority, 51.7%, of 
smokers supporting a permanent ban, and an overwhelming majority, 91.1%, of 
nonsmokers in favor.

OIL TANKER LEAVING FOR S.D. REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The oil tanker Exxon Valdez may be towed out of Prince William Sound in Alaska 
today to begin its journey to San Diego, where the vessel that caused the 
largest oil spill in U.S. history will be repaired, senior Coast Guard officers 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Capt. Jack Scarborough, captain of the Port of San Diego, and Coast 
Guard officers in Valdez, Alaska, said that initial plans called for the giant 
ship to be towed away on either Tuesday or today. However, officials in Valdez 
said the paper work for Coast Guard approval for the tow was not complete on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scarborough said the Coast Guard is preparing for the ship's arrival at the 
National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., where it will be in dry dock for about 
nine months. Nassco built the Valdez in 1986. The shipyard was awarded the 
$25-million contract last month. 
</P>
<P>
Scarborough said he will meet with San Diego city officials Thursday to brief 
them on the precautions that the Coast Guard and Exxon are taking to assure 
that the Valdez will not pose a pollution problem while in transit and when it 
arrives in San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extra Precautions' 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more precautions taken for this ship than for one coming in here 
with a load of natural gas," Scarborough said. "We're doing this primarily 
because we want the public to be satisfied that we are taking extra precautions 
to look out for their interest." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Exxon officials said that the tanks and exterior of the Valdez have 
been cleaned of oil and oil residue. Nevertheless, Scarborough said the Coast 
Guard plans to conduct aerial surveillance of the vessel while it is under tow 
to ensure that it is not leaking oil. 
</P>
<P>
"But the key fact here," he said, "is that the vessel is now empty and no 
longer a pollution threat. . . . We're not looking at her as a major pollution 
threat. Our main concern now is more of navigational safety; that she gets here 
without breaking up. . . . Our engineers from Washington (state) have done an 
inspection and declared her safe for ocean transit." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon says a hull area 700 feet long and 100 feet wide needs repair. Also, the 
hull has a hole that measures about 20 feet by 15 feet, "large enough to drive 
a truck trailer through."

<P>
CONSTRUCTION STARTS ON FREEWAY INTERCHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction began Tuesday on the new Tustin Ranch Road interchange on the 
Santa Ana Freeway, a $12-million project long sought by city officials to 
provide better access to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The interchange, scheduled for completion in 1991, will be the only access 
Tustin residents will have during two years of the massive, $1.2-billion 
freeway widening project, according to Caltrans officials. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-acre interchange site was donated by the Irvine Co., which has new 
housing developments nearby. The firm also designed the interchange under 
Caltrans' supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The project includes a sound wall intended to cut freeway noise.

<P>
MOBILE AD CAMPAIGN PROMOTES RIDE SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To promote ride sharing, large, portable signs with messages such as "Does it 
seem like this billboard is moving faster than you?" have been greeting 
motorists this week at key intersections in the Irvine Spectrum light 
industrial and office complex. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Spectrumotion, the area's transportation management association, 
the ad campaign is also intended to help The Irvine Co. achieve traffic 
reduction goals for the area that were set by the city as a condition of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Charity Gavaza, Spectrumotion's executive director, estimates that 20% of the 
17,000 employees in the Spectrum area already use car or van pools, mass 
transit or bicycles, or walk to work. 
</P>
<P>
One of the portable billboards states: "If you van pooled, you would have read 
this message 10 minutes ago." 
</P>
<P>
County transportation officials believe the Spectrum area is ripe for 
car-pooling and van-pooling efforts because so many workers there share the 
same work destinations. The complex is located near the junction of the Santa 
Ana and San Diego Freeways.

GARDEN GROVE DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER PURSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high speed chase between a Tustin police patrol car and a pickup truck driven 
by a Garden Grove man ended when the truck crashed through a wall and into a 
residence at the intersection of Newport Avenue and La Colina Drive early 
Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, identified as William Hoskins, 27, was hospitalized at Western 
Medical Center, Santa Ana, with internal injuries. No one in the residence was 
injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said Hoskins had been pulled over by an officer, who was 
standing beside the truck talking to him when he sped away. The officer ran 
back to his car and gave chase, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said Hoskins was charged with felony drunk driving under a new law 
that allows the more serious charge in cases of multiple convictions for 
driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
According to records at the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Hoskins 
has at least three drunken driving convictions and one reckless driving 
conviction in the last five years.

BETTY WINCKLER DEAD AT 82; 
</P>
<P>
SERVICES HELD FOR MUSEUM ORGANIZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial service was held Monday in Newport Beach for Betty Winckler, who led 
a group of 13 female volunteers in 1961 to form what became the Newport Harbor 
Art Museum. Mrs. Winckler died June 15 in Irvine after a long illness. She was 
82. 
</P>
<P>
Now an internationally known contemporary art museum, the Newport Harbor 
started out as the Fine Arts Patrons Pavilion Gallery on the second floor of 
the Balboa Pavilion. Mrs. Winckler served as its president until 1968, when the 
gallery changed its name and hired a professional staff. She remained on the 
board of trustees until 1981, subsequently becoming a trustee emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1906 in Long Beach, she attended Pomona College and UC Berkeley. After 
working in pottery in the 1940s, she studied painting with Rex Brandt and Phil 
Dike. Her late husband, Richard, owned Dick's Dock, a Newport Beach boatyard. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Audacious Years," the museum's catalogue of its first decade, Mrs. 
Winckler wrote: "In 1961 the movement (in Orange County) was under way for a 
cultural center. There were already well-organized groups supporting music, 
drama and dance, but an interest in the fine arts was not yet articulated. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us had been organizing and hanging shows in the (Newport Beach) City 
Hall and were aware of the need for a sustained program of museum-caliber 
exhibitions. . . . If we were to present exhibitions of museum quality, we 
realized that we had to obtain expert advice from professional museum people. . 
. . We did not want to be amateurs!" 
</P>
<P>
Advised by prominent art professionals, the Fine Arts Patrons -- as Mrs. 
Winckler's group was known -- originated such noteworthy exhibits as a 
retrospective of American painter Morris Graves (1963), "California Hard-Edge 
Painting" (1964) and work by Los Angeles painters Joe Goode and Ed Ruscha 
(1968). 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Winckler is survived by two sisters, Marjorie Conley of Long Beach and 
Frances Graham of Westminster, and two sons, Richard T. Winckler of Los Gatos 
and David C. Winckler of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The family asks that donations be made to the museum's Betty Winckler Memorial 
Fund, which will support educational programs in the new building the museum 
will occupy in 1992 at MacArthur Boulevard and Coast Highway.

DEVELOPER CHOSEN FOR SHERIFF'S LAB BUILDING; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS DECIDE ON HUTTON DEVELOPMENT FOR LONG-AWAITED, $27.9-MILLION 
PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state-of-the-art, $27.9-million facility to house the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department crime labs and offices in Santa Ana moved closer to reality Tuesday 
when a developer for the long-awaited project was selected. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing four proposals, the County Board of Supervisors voted 
unanimously to award the project to Santa Ana-based Hutton Development Co., 
which owns the 3.4-acre site at Flower Street and Santa Ana Boulevard, where 
the sheriff's new Forensic Science Center will be located. 
</P>
<P>
The forensic unit, which analyzes and tests evidence gathered at crime scenes, 
now operates out of two buildings in the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Hutton proposal calls for the eventual construction of twin seven-story 
buildings on the site with an adjacent five-story parking garage with 1,200 
spaces. The county will lease one of the buildings -- about 170,000 square 
feet, which includes a secured underground evidence storage garage -- to 
consolidate its forensics operations, with an option to buy the structure. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton Development will arrange the entire financing package for the project, 
with the county's lease payments based on the final design and construction 
cost of the building, said Linda Robinson, a senior analyst in the County 
Administrative Office. Those payments could be as much as $2.7 million a year, 
depending on the project's final price tag. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Hutton Development was viewed as a milestone in a four-year 
campaign to find the forensic unit a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a dream come true," said Larry Ragle, director of the sheriff's 
forensic services. "We've had too many people working in too small a space for 
too long. It's very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the 1988-89 Orange County Grand Jury endorsed the Hutton 
Development plan as the most cost-effective way to build a new crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
The final financing and leasing agreement between the county and Hutton 
Development should be completed within three months, county officials said. If 
approved by the supervisors, design and construction of the twin office 
buildings will take about two years, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a new forensic center now in sight, Ragle said, the county may have 
to spend up to $100,000 to enlarge the sheriff's crime lab facilities in the 
600 block of North Ross Street in Santa Ana. Much of that money is earmarked 
for special, high-tech equipment needed to set up a DNA laboratory, where 
criminalists can determine through gene testing whether semen, hair or blood 
matches a suspect. It would be the first such laboratory on the West Coast, a 
much-publicized goal of Sheriff/Coroner Brad Gates. 
</P>
<P>
The need for a roomier forensic center was first identified in a 1985 county 
report that concluded that sheriff's investigators and criminalists needed a 
100,000-square-foot facility to adequately perform evidence reviews and tests. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 112 employees in Ragle's unit work in about 42,500 square feet. 
"The new building will double our space almost overnight with plenty of room to 
grow," Ragle said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said the promise of substantial parking was a major difference 
between the Hutton package and the other three proposals that were considered. 
Each of those plans recommended that the forensic center be built on 1.5-acre 
site next to the Sheriff's Department on Flower Street across from Santa Ana 
Stadium. The property, however, would not be large enough to allow any on-site 
parking, a critical need in the Civic Center area.

FAST-MOVING FIRE DAMAGES BUILDING AT JOHN WAYNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A building housing two aviation equipment companies at John Wayne Airport was 
heavily damaged Tuesday by a fast-moving fire that sent a column of black smoke 
spewing over runways and the busy San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Five persons were treated for smoke inhalation and released at the Healthcare 
Medical Center in Tustin and College Hospital in Costa Mesa. Fire officials 
said they were sent to the hospitals to be checked and all appeared uninjured. 
The five were helping move aircraft away from the burning structure when they 
inhaled the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department Battalion Chief Harold Ferdig said the blaze was 
confined to a small portable structure that housed Western Avionics Inc. and 
Western Instruments, businesses that service and sell aircraft instruments. The 
building, located at 19331 Airport Way South, was subleased to the companies by 
Martin Aviation Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out at 5:40 p.m. Ferdig said the intense smoke was caused by 
flames spreading to a small attic area of the portable structure. Firefighters 
were unable to reach the area until the fire burned through the structure. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Aviation facilities, which are connected to the avionics building, were 
not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
When the fire broke out, employees at Martin Aviation, founded by Orange County 
pioneer aviator Eddie Martin, helped move some small private aircraft that were 
parked near the building, Ferdig said. No aircraft were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The area where the fire broke out was recently the site of the farewell 
ceremony for 11-year-old Tony Aliengena, the San Juan Capistrano boy who is 
trying to become the youngest pilot to fly around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Ferdig said that the cause of the fire was under investigation and that the 
extent of damage caused by the blaze was not immediately known.

A BREAK FOR O.C. HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A missing element in coping with problems of the homeless in Orange County has 
been community commitment, especially by the private sector. Why? Perhaps too 
many people doubt that homelessness can be a serious problem in so prosperous a 
county. 
</P>
<P>
But homelessness is a serious problem, and it does need a community effort. A 
beginning impetus may have come last week when the county's Building Industry 
Assn. started its HomeAid program. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the program so noteworthy is not so much its scope -- which is 
rather small -- but that it marks the developers' first major effort to direct 
resources from the private building industry to the homeless. HomeAid involves 
about $1 million and will add about 35 "transitional housing" beds throughout 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Modest as that may seem in contrast with the need to shelter 8,000 to 10,000 
homeless people -- half of them children -- the developers' program involves 
about four times as much money as homeless advocates get each year from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
To meet current needs, the county should have about 4,500 transitional beds -- 
places for people and families to stay while they get on their feet. There are 
only about 200. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency shelters are the first step away from homeless status. Transitional 
beds are the second, places to stay while accumulating advances and deposits 
needed to become renters. The last step is an adequate supply of affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
We welcome developers to the fight to get homeless people off the streets and 
back into permanent housing. We hope that the move will encourage other 
businesses and industries to help. 
</P>
<P>
According to surveys, about 30% of the county's homeless population come from 
the middle class; most have lived in the county for about 10 years and have 
high school educations or better. Illness, a lost job, divorce or other 
setbacks have made them homeless. Some work but cannot save the money for an 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The BIA program will help some of those residents. It would help more if it 
touched off a public-private partnership to produce enough lower-cost housing 
to provide that third step away from homelessness: a permanent residence.

AUG. 1, 1972, WAS NATE'S GREAT DAY; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES' COLBERT MADE HISTORY WITH FIVE HOMERS IN DOUBLEHEADER

<TEXT>
<P>
Two dates in baseball history will always be most important in Nate Colbert's 
memory book. 
</P>
<P>
On May 2, 1954, Colbert was an 8-year-old fan in the stands in St. Louis when 
Stan Musial set a major league record by hitting five home runs in a 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years later, on Aug. 1, 1972, Colbert duplicated Musial's feat while 
playing first base for the Padres in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Since nobody else has done this, Musial and Colbert have a common bond that has 
made them good friends. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert, 43, looked back on those two historic days recently before taking the 
field as first base coach of the Riverside Red Wave, the Padres' farm club in 
the Class A California League. An ordained minister after graduating from St. 
Louis Baptist College (now Missouri Baptist), he also serves the Padres in the 
off-season as a speaker in the community relations department. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in St. Louis," Colbert said. "I lived close to old Busch Stadium, 
and I sat in the bleachers with a glove, trying to catch batting practice home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan was my idol after that day (the five home runs). Now when I see him, he 
says, 'We're the only ones to do it.' When I was in high school, I helped out 
in the clubhouse, and sometimes they let me take batting practice. I hit the 
scoreboard once in a tryout camp. 
</P>
<P>
"Before games, I would sit in Stan's locker, and he was great to me. He was 
always so kind." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals were Colbert's team, the only one he ever wanted to play with. 
The amateur draft was still a year away when he finished high school in 1964, 
so he was able to sign with the team of his choice. He says he turned down 16 
major league bonus offers and 30 college scholarship offers to sign with the 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
But Colbert never got to put on a Cardinal uniform. The Houston Astros drafted 
him out of the St. Louis organization after the 1965 season, and the Padres 
picked him off the Houston roster in the expansion draft when they entered the 
National League in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated to leave St. Louis," he said. 'It took me till my mid-20s not to root 
for the Cardinals. Whenever I saw their uniform, I wished I was in it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his homesickness, Colbert quickly became a favorite in San Diego. He 
hit 24 home runs, then 38, 27 and 38 again in the first four of his six 
seasons. His total of 127 at that point was 17 more than Hank Aaron had at the 
same stage of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I could hit 500 or more," Colbert said. "I felt like 30 a year was a 
foregone conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a chronic back problem limited Colbert to 46 more homers, for a 
total of 173. After just nine major league seasons, he was forced to retire, at 
31. 
</P>
<P>
"I dropped my goal, so I thought maybe I'd hit 300," Colbert said. "Then my 
back got worse and worse. It was deterioration of the vertebrae." 
</P>
<P>
But nothing that happened as he struggled through his later years could dim the 
luster of his record-breaking performance 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was a twi-night doubleheader at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium, sometimes 
known as the Launching Pad. And Colbert didn't just tie Musial's record of five 
home runs in a doubleheader; he set major league records of 13 runs batted in 
and 22 total bases. He had seven hits -- the two others were singles -- in nine 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert went on tie the National League record of eight homers in a week before 
being stopped in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a chance to blow the record all out of proportion," he said. "But the 
Dodgers kept pitching around me, and even their fans were booing. One night, I 
didn't get an official at-bat, just walks. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Dodger players came over and congratulated me. Don Sutton said, 
'You're not going to hit one off me.' I had hit seven (homers) off him in '70, 
but he was right that time." 
</P>
<P>
Here is how Colbert recalled his never-to-be-forgotten night in Atlanta: 
</P>
<P>
"I hit two in the first game and three in the second, to all fields and off 
five different pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one was a three-run homer off Ron Schueler. The second was a solo 
shot off a left-hander, Larry Jaster, and it went to straightaway center. I got 
all of it. I hit both on the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second game, I hit one with nobody on off Jim Hardin on the first 
pitch, then I hit a grand slam off Pat Jarvis on a 1-0 pitch. I did look at a 
pitch that time. Finally, I hit a two-run shot off Cecil Upshaw -- on the first 
pitch again." 
</P>
<P>
Note that Colbert hit his five home runs on just six pitches. Even for a 
confirmed first-ball hitter, this was incredible. 
</P>
<P>
"The crazy thing about my fifth home run was that Upshaw threw me an overhand 
fastball," Colbert said. "He was a submarine pitcher, and I don't know what he 
was thinking going overhand against a right-handed hitter." 
</P>
<P>
The kicker to the amazing story is that Colbert came within inches of hitting 
two more home runs that night. Both of his singles came after fly balls that 
barely went foul before landing in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"My first time up, I hit one off Tom Kelley that went into the top deck," 
Colbert said. "I stood there and watched it, and it looked fair, but the 
weather was kind of hazy, and I couldn't tell for sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hit everything they threw me. Once I tried to get out of the way of a 
pitch and hit a line drive up the middle for a single." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the thrill of the occasion for Colbert was praise from Aaron. The 
home run king was playing left for the Braves, and he congratulated Colbert 
after the fifth homer. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Aaron) stopped me as I went out to first base," Colbert said. "He said, 
'That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.' Coming from him, the greatest 
player I've ever seen, that really meant a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Rico Carty talked to me, too. He said, 'Big boy, I've never seen that before.' 
It took a while for me to come down to earth after a night like that." 
</P>
<P>
Colbert didn't hit for high averages -- his best was .270 in 1973 -- but he was 
one of the most feared hitters in baseball. In the year of his five-home-run 
night, he drove in 111 runs. He played in the All-Star Games of 1971, 1972 and 
1973, appearing as a pinch hitter each time. 
</P>
<P>
But Colbert's back ailment kept getting worse. After he had hit .207 with just 
14 home runs in 1974, the Padres sent him to the Detroit Tigers in a deal that 
also involved the Cardinals. The Padres got pitcher Bob Strampe, who didn't 
make the club, and outfielder Dick Sharon, who hit .194 in 1975 and was heard 
from no more. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers used Colbert only sparingly before selling him in June 1975 to the 
Montreal Expos, who used him even less before releasing him in June 1976. The 
Oakland A's signed him to a Tucson contract and brought him up in September, 
but he appeared in only two games and became a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Colbert had one more chance. The Toronto Blue Jays invited him to 
camp in 1977. When his back didn't come around, he retired. 
</P>
<P>
"Those last years were real tough," he said. "I had been around baseball long 
enough to know that once you're traded, you're always going to be traded. I was 
supposed to help those clubs as a power hitter, but I'd sit around, and it just 
wasn't there anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I did have some moments in Montreal. I hit two game-winning home runs and two 
that tied games. But the pitchers knew I was a first-pitch hitter, so they 
changed speeds a lot on me. When they threw straight changes in fastball 
situations, they hurt me big-time." 
</P>
<P>
The subject turned to the original major league Padres, who lost 110 games, and 
to some of the players who helped Colbert to get the franchise off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have that many people at the ballpark, but we had a good bunch of 
guys, and we had fun," Colbert said. "Some of the real characters were Al 
McBean, Bobby Pena and Jack Baldschun. And Dick Selma. He was crazy, but what a 
great arm he had. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Ollie Brown was our best player, but after he left, he never played 
regularly. It was probably because he came from an expansion team." 
</P>
<P>
Colbert's best friend on that team was Cito Gaston, who recently became manager 
of the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
"Cito and I were roommates for six years," Colbert said. "We used to talk about 
what we'd do after we quit playing, and neither one of us wanted to be a coach 
or a manager. But I'm real happy for Cito now. I know he'll do a great job." 
</P>
<P>
Now that his old buddy has joined the thin ranks of black managers, Colbert was 
asked if he wanted to do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not me," Colbert said. "The job I'd like in baseball is in the upper 
echelon. I'd like to be a general manager or a farm director or a vice 
president of baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a player-manager in Mexico in '82. It was a great experience, a lot of 
fun, but I don't need that kind of stress. Having to worry about everyday 
slumps and injuries and family problems, that's not for me. Everybody has 
goals, but I've never wanted to manage." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many athletes, Colbert did not find retirement easy. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year (1977) was very tough," he said. "About 3 o'clock every day, 
I'd get so antsy that my wife would say to me, 'Get a basketball and go play.' 
I was unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
"But after taking that first year off, I got back into baseball with the Padre 
organization. I was a roving hitting instructor, worked in the front office and 
came back to the field in '87 as a coach with Wichita (the Padres' double-A 
farm). After two years there, I wanted to be closer to home, so I switched to 
Riverside. I enjoy it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Colbert hasn't given up active sports totally. He sponsors and plays for a 
slow-pitch softball team, and still hits the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
"One time in '84, I hit six straight home runs in a doubleheader in Yuma," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert and his wife, Kasey, who also is an ordained minister, have nine 
children and eight grandchildren. They have an outreach ministry and also some 
real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering my medical history, I probably shouldn't even have played major 
league baseball," he said. "I'm not satisfied with my numbers, but I look at my 
career as a gift of God. I feel very fortunate."

SCOTT OSTLER: FERNANDO WITHIN LEFT ARM'S REACH OF MAKING IT BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's a hard racket out there," said John Roseboro, sitting on the Dodger bench 
before the old-timers' game last Sunday and nodding out toward the pitcher's 
mound. "If I was a youngster, that's the last place I would go. That arm is a 
delicate thing." 
</P>
<P>
Roseboro was the Dodger catcher during the Koufax-Drysdale era. 
</P>
<P>
That era ended when Don Drysdale's right shoulder wore out and Sandy Koufax's 
pitching fingers went dead, forcing him to retire rather than face the prospect 
of life nicknamed Rightie. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Drysdale and Koufax were at Dodger Stadium Sunday to suit up and throw 
an inning or two for the sake of nostalgia, and each seemed to feature a 
healthy pitching arm. Koufax wasn't out to embarrass any of his former 
teammates, but I've heard he is in great pitching shape and could walk to the 
mound right now and throw major league heaters for at least a few innings. 
</P>
<P>
Which is more than you can say for Fernando Valenzuela, the Dodger starting 
pitcher in the young-timers' game that followed. Once, Fernando had a left arm 
as sturdy and durable as a construction crane. He started 255 games without 
missing a turn, a streak as impressive to me as Lou Gehrig's. 
</P>
<P>
Then something snapped or stretched or twanged in Fernando's left shoulder and 
he became mortal. This is the year of his comeback. He began the season 
throwing fastballs that would stick in a spider web. The location of his 
pitches, as they say in baseball, was poor, several of them becoming located 
beyond the outfield walls. 
</P>
<P>
He had bad stuff. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, watching Fernando work was a pleasure. Even opposing batters 
admired his craftsmanship. His pitches were like snowflakes, no two exactly 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
But now, suddenly, he was a joke. It was a question of which was larger -- 
Fernando's fastball or the hitters' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
How long could the Dodgers afford to keep sending Valenzuela out to the mound 
for his twice-a-week shelling? How much damage could his dignity sustain before 
he took himself out of the rotation? His record was 0-5. What would be the 
cutoff point? 0-10? 0-20? 
</P>
<P>
Then, about three weeks ago, the comeback started to kick in. Going into 
Sunday's game against the Braves, Fernando had won two in a row. Under the hot 
sun, he seemed to be throwing well, except for a gopher ball in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
I went down to watch a few innings from the dugout box seats behind home plate, 
the best place to watch a pitcher at work. Dodger scout Mike Brito was there, 
as always, aiming his speed gun at every pitch and then making a notation on 
his chart. 
</P>
<P>
"He's up to 81, 82 (m.p.h.) today," Brito said. "But it's not the speed. The 
important thing is his control. His control was killing him. Now he has good 
command." 
</P>
<P>
Brito is like a boxing manager, even down to the big cigar puffs and chomps in 
the 90-degree heat. Fernando is Brito's prize heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got more confidence in himself now. The cut fastball is working real 
well." 
</P>
<P>
The cut fastball? 
</P>
<P>
"He started throwing it about five games ago," Brito said. "I think (pitching 
coach Ron) Perranoski taught him. It's like a hard slider. He's throwing it a 
lot now." 
</P>
<P>
A man named Frankie, who pitches batting practice to the Dodgers and is 
Fernando's friend, joined the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"Fernando's in great shape," Frankie said. "He's in the weight room every day, 
working on the weights, using the Versaclimber (leg- and arm-exercise 
machine)." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the plate, catcher Mike Scioscia gave a sign, then shifted his body a 
foot closer to the batter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's working inside a lot more now," Frankie said. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando fired, the ball took a quick little swerve to our left and Scioscia's 
mitt never moved. Inside corner, called strike. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the cut fastball," Brito said over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando's agent, Tony DeMarco, joined the little gathering behind the screen. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how stoic Fernando is," DeMarco said. "When things were going bad, he 
never fell to the floor, never cried. He maintained his dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Did his fans desert him? No Dodger, no athlete, has ever enjoyed support from 
the city's Spanish-speaking community the way Fernando has over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"The drama of going through the tough times, betrayed by luck, people got 
behind him even more," DeMarco said. "Fernando stopped being the superstar and 
they supported him very much. The Dodgers, from the brass to his teammates, 
they stayed with him, too. The Mexican (Mexico City) press has been very hard 
on him, but now I see stories, 'The Bull Is Charging Again.' " 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia scooted back and forth behind the plate, set his targets and sucked up 
the pitches as if using a magnet. 
</P>
<P>
"Scroogie," said Frankie as Geronimo Berroa waved weakly at a two-strike 
screwball, a pitch that detours in the opposite direction of the cut fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you, he's back," Brito said. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela faded in the eighth and was replaced. He marched to the dugout and 
slammed down his glove. After the game, his once ugly record now improved to 
3-5, he turned his back on the reporters gathered at his locker and tossed out 
a few grumpy statements. He was more of a fun guy when his arm was unbreakable. 
</P>
<P>
He is not back yet, not all the way. Maybe he never will be. His future rides 
on his pitching arm, and that arm is a delicate thing.

ROSE'S REQUEST FOR RESTRAINING ORDER IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose's request for a temporary restraining order on a hearing with 
baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti was delayed until Thursday by a Hamilton 
County Common Pleas judge. 
</P>
<P>
Rose wants to block a hearing scheduled for next Monday in New York with 
Giamatti, who is considering allegations that the Cincinnati manager bet on Red 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was assured Tuesday that no disciplinary action will be taken against him 
for at least the rest of this week. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has sued Giamatti in an attempt to have the court, not the commissioner, 
determine his guilt or innocence. Rose contends that Giamatti is biased and has 
already decided, assertions the commissioner has denied. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Norbert N. Nadel met in his chambers for 30 minutes with lawyers for 
Rose, the ballclub and the commissioner's office before scheduling the formal 
hearing for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel also said that baseball's attorneys promised that Giamatti would take no 
action against Rose through Sunday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's rules give the commissioner authority to suspend anyone who refuses 
to cooperate with a baseball investigation. 
</P>
<P>
If granted, Rose's request for the restraining order would halt Giamatti's 
hearing next Monday while the court considers whether Rose has been granted a 
fair investigation by baseball. 
</P>
<P>
If Nadel declines to grant a restraining order, baseball's hearing can proceed 
as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides will be able to call witnesses at Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, in Atlanta where the Reds' game against the Braves was postponed because 
of rain Tuesday, said he won't appear Thursday. He repeated his contention that 
he never bet on baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Rose would never do anything to hurt baseball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, CBS showed an interview with Ron Peters, who allegedly accepted 
most of Rose's bets and who was interviewed as part of baseball's 
investigation. Peters said Rose once called him from in or near the ballpark to 
make a bet on his team and that Rose was a "sick gambler" who had a standing 
$2,000 bet on the Reds to win. 
</P>
<P>
Peters told CBS he once received a call from Rose "shortly before the game." 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen minutes, maybe, I get a phone call, who says it was Pete," Peters 
said. "And Pete proceeds to make four or five baseball bets . . . one of them 
being on the Reds, and then I turn on my TV set to watch the game and there's 
Pete, hanging out of the dugout." 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Nadel, the 225-page report written by baseball 
investigator John M. Dowd was placed in the court record by lawyers for the 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our intention that it become part of the public record," Deputy 
Commissioner Francis T. Vincent Jr. said in New York. "It is surely up to the 
judge now." 
</P>
<P>
Nadel chose to review the report privately. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the information in Dowd's confidential report was released Monday in 
Rose's lawsuit, attempting to show that Giamatti has conducted the 
investigation in a biased and prejudiced manner. Giamatti said he was 
disappointed Rose's lawyers chose to make the details public. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dowd: "I'm sorry it happened. We tried to keep a civil forum and (keep the 
report) confidential." 
</P>
<P>
Dowd was in the courtroom Tuesday, but didn't participate in the private 
conference with Nadel. Dowd is likely to be one of the witnesses Thursday 
because Rose's lawyers attacked his credibility in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had written an unbiased report on the allegations, Dowd responded: 
"Yes, I did."

HE STILL HAS THE MAGIC TOUCH; 
</P>
<P>
WILLIE MOSCONI, 75, SAYS HE DOESN'T MISS POOL, BUT ON RECENT TOUR YOU'D NEVER 
KNOW IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Willie Mosconi walks into the Billiards and Barstools Store in San Bernardino, 
where 300 people have been awaiting his arrival in a room not built to hold 300 
people. As the 15-time world pocket billiards champion enters, the room becomes 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
After applause breaks the silence, children run over for autographs and/or 
photographs. Adults begin throwing down $25 for an opportunity to play against 
him for charity. Some folks simply ask him to touch their pool sticks so that 
maybe, magically, it will make them better players. 
</P>
<P>
Mosconi, 75, denies that he misses pool. He insists that he now spends his free 
time playing golf, another game in which the object is to put a ball into a 
hole with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
But anyone who saw him tour California earlier this month -- and there were 
many who did -- would dispute that Mosconi has left the game completely behind. 
Playing in six cities in four days, he helped raise $10,000 for the Casa Colina 
Wheelchair Sports Program while also resurrecting some priceless memories for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Still dapper, his silvery hair slicked back, Mosconi averaged more than 70 
games a day against any opponent willing to donate $25. 
</P>
<P>
When Mosconi wasn't peppering the crowd with his one-liners, he was using some 
of his physics-defying spin to make trick shots. 
</P>
<P>
The men he played were dispatched quickly. All of the women, however, were 
given gift-wrapped victories as Mosconi intentionally missed shots with a flair 
he usually reserves for making them. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow," said David Maidment, owner of two Billiards and Barstools stores. "He 
would just put the last ball on the edge for the ladies to win, just leave the 
ball bouncing between the two corners of the pocket." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after his recent tour, Mosconi often wrapped himself in 
nostalgia and stopped only to ridicule arch-foe Minnesota Fats, whom he 
genuinely dislikes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never a hustler," he says loudly and proudly. "I was the youngest player 
in Philadelphia, and we had the greatest players there. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever the hustlers came to town, they would have to play me first because I 
was the youngest. And they wouldn't get to play again," he said with a smile. 
"No money left. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in competition, there was nothing I couldn't do with a billiard 
ball. I didn't have a fear. Nobody was better than me, especially not that fat 
guy. The guy who called himself Minnesota Fats never saw Minnesota in his life. 
He was from New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like taking candy from a baby when I played him. I enjoyed it. I always 
killed him. I would point to a chair and say, 'Hey, fatso, go sit over there 
and watch. You'll be over there the rest of the afternoon."' 
</P>
<P>
Mosconi, who now lives in Hadon Heights, N.J., began playing professionally at 
19, although he had been playing exhibitions since he was 6. Mosconi's father, 
Joseph, owned a pool parlor but wouldn't allow Willie to play, locking up the 
balls at night and trying to steer Willie toward a career in entertainment 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to be a dancer," Mosconi says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Willie's uncles, Charles and Louis, were prominent in vaudeville, and Willie 
became their reluctant -- and quite bad -- student when he was 5. One day, 
however, while playing pool with Charles, Willie sank 15 consecutive balls, and 
his father, who couldn't lock up the tables, later learned that Willie had been 
practicing at night with a pool cue and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 6, Willie won a series of exhibitions against older children, 
including one victory in which he sank 40 consecutive balls. However, he later 
became bored and retired at the age of 7. 
</P>
<P>
He resumed playing when he was 19, after having been fired as an upholsterer's 
apprentice during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he holds several records, among them a run of 526 balls -- "I never did 
miss," he says, "I got tired and quit." -- and he has served as technical 
adviser for "The Hustler" and "The Color of Money." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best example of Mosconi's impact on pool occurred in an exhibition 
in Mission Viejo on Nov. 17, 1985. A rule was being debated in his game, and 
the official went to a book for guidance. The book was titled "Pocket 
Billiards." 
</P>
<P>
Author? Willie Mosconi. 
</P>
<P>
Mosconi retired permanently from professional billiards seven years ago, nearly 
50 years after his first pro game. He says he got out after winning his 15th 
championship because he got "bored playing the same guys every year and beating 
the hell out of them. I don't miss the game." 
</P>
<P>
Do you believe him? 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had to compete for his attention against billiards, and he still 
comes to life when he's at the table," says Flora Mosconi, his wife of 36 
years. "We saw that while he was touring California. He was enjoying every 
minute of it."

CIF ADMINISTRATOR DAVIS ACCEPTS COLLEGE POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Margaret Davis, administrator in the California Interscholastic Federation and 
Southern Section for 15 years, has been named an associate athletic director at 
Idaho State University. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, associate commissioner of the CIF, will begin her new job July 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have accomplished most of what I set out to do, and the opportunity 
at Idaho State offers me a chance to work and live in a new and exciting 
environment," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is generally credited with organizing girls' sports programs in the 
1970s, when the programs made a successful transition from loosely organized 
Girls' Athletic Assn. club sports to fully sanctioned programs in the Southern 
Section. 
</P>

"Margaret Davis has been an outstanding professional leader for interscholastic 
athletics and will be sorely missed," said Tom Byrnes, CIF commissioner.

<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Isom, an assistant coach in the Huntington Beach Union High School 
District for 16 years, has been named varsity football coach at Ocean View High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Isom, 41, replaces Guy Carrozzo, who resigned 10 days ago to accept a varsity 
position at Elsinore High. 
</P>
<P>
Isom became an assistant at his alma mater, Westminster High, in 1973 under 
former Coach Bill Boswell and then moved to Huntington Beach High in 1980 where 
he was an assistant under Greg Henry and George Pascoe. 
</P>
<P>
Isom has been an assistant at Ocean View for the past four years, serving under 
Karl Gaytan for one season and then under Carrozzo for three. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Jones, offensive coordinator at Long Beach Millikan High School the past 
two seasons, has been named varsity football coach at El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 29, previously was an assistant at San Luis Obispo for one season and at 
Arroyo Grande for four. Jones, who replaces Carl Sweet, was selected from among 
25 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Shaw, a 5-foot-11, 175-pound defensive back from Brea-Olinda High School, 
has been named to replace Greg Hansell on the North roster that will 
participate in the 30th Orange County All-Star football game June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell decided to drop from the 36-play roster after posting a 13-1 record as 
a pitcher and being drafted by the Boston Red Sox. He previously signed a 
national letter of intent to play football at the Nevada Reno. 
</P>
<P>
South Coach Dave Holland has added Edison's Greg Thurston, a 6-4, 225-pound 
tackle, to replace Santiago's Dana Ripley. Ripley was selected to play but 
failed to report to team meetings or the opening day of camp.

A stock car driver involved in a crash Saturday night at Saugus Speedway said 
that he deliberately made contact with the other car involved as a retaliatory 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
Richard DeLong Sr., 52, of Castaic, who was involved in a fiery crash with 
Chuck Pittenger, 44, of Northridge, said he attempted to "spin out" Pittenger 
during the 15-lap semi-main event. DeLong claimed that Pittenger had caused him 
to spin out two laps earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I took him out," DeLong said. "I just wanted to give him back what he gave 
me. I figured, if I can't finish the race, then neither is he." 
</P>
<P>
As both cars slammed into the wall, DeLong's vaulted over Pittenger's and 
landed atop the wall on its left side. Spectators in the grandstands scurried 
from the scene as Pittenger, who walked away unhurt, leaped from his burning 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
DeLong suffered a broken left foot and minor burns. NASCAR officials are 
reviewing the incident.

SQUABBLING IN THE AUTO WORKERS UNION; 
</P>
<P>
FLOUTING CONVENTION; 
</P>
<P>
DISSIDENT UNIONISTS, COMPARING THEMSELVES TO CHINESE STUDENTS, RALLY AND ROLL.

<P>
It was one part revival meeting, one part testimonial and one part pep talk in 
the smoke-choked ballroom of the Jolly Roger Inn. 
</P>
<P>
The dissident faction of the United Auto Workers had gathered Tuesday morning 
at the hotel, next door to the Anaheim Convention Center, to plot strategy 
after two days of stinging defeat, and it needed to get some momentum rolling. 
</P>
<P>
For the union's New Directions faction, the Jolly Roger Inn was the place to 
be. On the floor of the UAW's national convention, the dissidents feel 
isolated, dispersed and out-shouted. The UAW administration has littered the 
convention hall with anti-dissident brochures, New Directions members 
complained, and has intimidated some delegates into following the union's party 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after reaching Anaheim on Sunday, New Directions headed half a block east 
to the hotel and restaurant where they are holding what amounts to a 
counter-convention. At the daily gatherings, the podium is theirs, the rhetoric 
is favorable, and they can plot strategy without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
And Tuesday's gathering was especially important, more spirited and urgent than 
previous sessions. So far, the convention had gone against them, and the 
dissidents were trying to turn the tide. 
</P>
<P>
As New Directions leaders filed through the crowd of 200, delegate Gary Hart 
from Roanoake, Ind., stood up, tossed off a clenched-fist salute and exhorted 
his union brothers and sisters to mobilize against the UAW administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been letting them kick our butts too long," Hart shouted, as dissident 
leaders Don Douglas, Pete Kelly and Jerry Tucker headed for the podium. "It's 
time for us to stand up and fight!" 
</P>
<P>
And so it went for more than two hours, as the troops cheered and New 
Directions leaders attempted to regain ground lost in the first days of the 
union's national convention. And they had their work cut out for them. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, UAW President Owen Bieber had blasted the dissidents in his keynote 
address, charging that the group failed to understand the realities of 
international competition. The next day, the group lost in its first efforts to 
change the union's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, the dissidents vowed that they would be downtrodden no more. Some 
likened themselves to the students who demonstrated in Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square; both groups, they said, were street fighters seeking democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Tucker, who is up for re-election today as director of the union's 
Central U.S. Region 5, warmed up the crowd like an old-time preacher, as he 
stood under the meeting room's cathedral ceiling and urged the congregation to 
join in "a march of conviction to that arena" where the union delegates would 
later convene. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to see if we can turn today into something different from the past 
few days," Tucker said. "We have a solemn mission to represent our point of 
view. Today is the day we do that -- the day we take the microphone." 
</P>
<P>
Correan Benson, for one, was well prepared for the later assault on the 
convention as a whole. In a grocery bag by the side of the alternate delegate 
from St. Louis, Mo., was a large box of Milk Bones -- a present for UAW Vice 
President Don Ephlin. 
</P>
<P>
Ephlin had further estranged the dissidents on Monday when he said that the 
group had committed an "unforgivable sin" and had "done damage" to the union 
with their dissension. "Why should we throw a bone to them?" he asked at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Benson shook the Milk Bones over her head and told the crowd that 17 years of 
paying union dues had bought her the right to talk, to say what she wanted no 
matter how unpopular her views are to the UAW administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Since he won't give us a bone, we'll give him one," Benson shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most poignant speaker at the fiery pre-convention meeting was 
Genora Dollinger. A native of Flint, Mich., Dollinger is one of only three 
original UAW organizers alive today. 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents, with several hundred members present, had felt outgunned at the 
convention, where some 2,000 delegates were gathering. But don't worry about 
the numbers, Dollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Me Gusta Muchisima' 
</P>
<P>
"It was this kind of a caucus that grew into the mighty and powerful UAW," 
Dollinger said. "The only difference I see is more women, more people of color 
and a few more idiomatic expressions." 
</P>
<P>
She paused, flashed a grin and continued in Spanish: "Y me gusta muchisima!" 
The translation: "And I like it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
When Dollinger finished, it was time to line up for the assault on the UAW, to 
leave the safety of the Jolly Roger. The crowd stubbed out cigarettes, donned 
blue New Directions jackets, practiced a chant or two and reached for their 
placards. 
</P>
<P>
Down the stairs and across the parking lot they marched, crying, "What do we 
need? New Directions! When do we want them? Now!" They marched past friend and 
foe on the way to the showdown at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
There were "Boos!" and there were jeers as they marched through an exhibit room 
filled with shining American-made cars and tractors. "I think they're just a 
bunch of agitators," said John Fodera, a delegate from Warren, Mich., as the 
New Directions crowd passed by. 
</P>
<P>
An organ rendition of "Happy Days Are Here Again" played tinnily on tape in the 
massive meeting hall where Bieber held court, signing autographs for 
well-wishers. As the marchers filed past him into the hall, Bieber looked up 
and spread his hands. 
</P>
<P>
He had only one comment to make: "It's a democratic union," he said.

LIN BROADCASTING REBUFFS $5.8-BILLION MCCAW CELLULAR BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lin Broadcasting on Tuesday rejected a $5.8-billion takeover offer from McCaw 
Cellular Communications and said it was talking to various potential buyers and 
exploring other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based cellular telephone and broadcasting concern said the 
$120-a-share offer McCaw made on June 6 for the 90% of Lin that it doesn't 
already own is inadequate. The offer, Lin said, discounted the company's 
chances of acquiring Metromedia Inc.'s interests in cellular systems in New 
York and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Lin is appealing an unfavorable court ruling in its bid to acquire Metromedia's 
45% interest in the New York system and 49% interest in the Philadelphia 
system. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the outcome of the case is uncertain, Lin cited 
estimates by analysts that "a complete victory by the company in the Metromedia 
litigation could enhance shareholder value by at least $40 a share." Lin said 
it is looking at ways it could turn a court victory into a direct cash 
distribution to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say another reason Lin is attractive to would-be buyers is its 35% 
interest in Los Angeles Cellular Telephone, which serves the booming cellular 
market of Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at McCaw Cellular's headquarters in Kirkland, Wash., expressed 
disappointment at Lin's reaction and requested access to any non-public 
information Lin might provide to other potential bidders. John W. Stanton, 
McCaw's vice chairman, said in an interview that McCaw executives are 
interested in meeting with Lin officials to discuss the bid, which he termed "a 
full and fair offer" providing a premium over Lin's price during the last six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Neil T. Anderson, a partner in the New York law firm of Sullivan &amp; 
Cromwell, which represents McCaw Cellular, said the company's bid reflects the 
current status of Lin's Metromedia suit. 
</P>
<P>
"If new material becomes available before the expiration of the tender offer, 
we will evaluate what that means," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After McCaw announced its offer two weeks ago, the price of Lin's shares jumped 
to well above the price McCaw was offering, apparently on speculation that 
other bidders would emerge. Lin's shares declined last week but climbed again 
on Tuesday to close at $125.625, up $2.625 from the day before in active 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
"Traders like to see a company fight a bid. It suggests a higher offer is 
coming," said Thomas W. Friedberg, a Seattle-based analyst for Piper Jaffray 
&amp; Hopwood. 
</P>
<P>
The regional Bell companies or GTE Corp. are considered the most likely to make 
a competing bid for Lin, partly because they are believed to have the financial 
resources to top McCaw's offer. 
</P>
<P>
Lin said it will continue with previously announced plans to spin off its 
broadcasting stations into a separate company. The move would "make it easier 
for a telephone company or a cable television company to buy Lin's cellular 
systems," Friedberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Lin also said it has begun 
meetings with some prospective buyers and will contact others to determine 
their interest. Other options mentioned were a financial overhaul of the 
company and a possible special dividend to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw appeared to strengthen its hand in the bidding for Lin on Tuesday by 
completing the sale of a 20% stake in the company to British Telecom. The $1.37 
billion in proceeds from the sale "is the cornerstone" of the financing for the 
Lin purchase, Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw's stock closed Tuesday at $41.50, up 75 cents.

P&amp;G TO FUND RECYCLING OF PAPER DIAPERS

Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday that it plans to fund projects to recycle 
the plastic from disposable diapers into such things as flower pots, garbage 
bags and park benches. 
</P>
<P>
The pulp lining of the diapers, once "sanitized," could be used in cardboard 
boxes, building insulation and wallboard liner, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of babies in the United States wear disposable diapers, adding up to 
18 billion discarded diapers each year, which account for as much as 2% of U.S. 
landfill use. Environmentalists have warned that the plastic-coated diapers 
don't decompose once they're carted to the garbage dump; that, they say, could 
provide a potential breeding ground for dangerous viruses and bacteria that 
cause polio, hepatitis, meningitis and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe as a company it is our responsibility to ensure that our products 
are good not only for the baby but that they are good for the environment and 
can be easily recycled . . . and incinerated," said Nancy Eddy, P&amp;G's 
project coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati-based P&amp;G, the largest disposable diaper maker, sells $1.65 
billion worth of Pampers and Luvs annually. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the National Press Club, company officials 
said P&amp;G would spend an undetermined amount of money over the next five 
years on recycling projects in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The project includes an effort with Rabanco Co. and the Solid Waste Utility of 
Seattle, Wash., which will collect used diapers from 1,000 volunteer 
households. The diapers will be washed and sanitized before being separated 
into plastic and pulp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Applaud Efforts' 
</P>
<P>
P&amp;G will also provide money and soiled diapers to Recomp Inc., a St. Cloud, 
Minn., recycling company that turns much of that city's garbage into a 
composted soil used in landscaping and to reclaim salt-tainted highway strips. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lehrburger, an Albany, N.Y., recycling expert who has studied disposable 
diapers for the cloth-diaper industry, questioned whether the recycling of 
plastic and paper would be economically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"I applaud their efforts in seeking alternatives to the environmentally harmful 
disposal of their product," he said, but added that the company seems 
determined to maintain its product rather than changing to a more ecologically 
sound diaper. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the disposal problem, some manufacturers have introduced 
biodegradable diapers -- using a plastic made from corn -- that disappear into 
the environment once discarded. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers in Nebraska, a key corn-producing state, have banned the sale of 
non-biodegradable diapers by 1993. Legislators in Iowa, Washington and Oregon 
have considered similar action. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Nicolosi, vice president of P&amp;G's paper products division, said 
the announcement Tuesday was not motivated by market or legislative pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any one announcement is going to stop the concern within 
state legislatures," he said. "What I hope it will do is focus attention on 
viable solutions." 
</P>
<P>
P&amp;G said it will also spend $160,000 on an effort to prove that 
competitors' diapers, touted as biodegradable, don't decompose any faster than 
P&amp;G brands.

DISSIDENTS LOSE BID TO CURB LABOR-MANAGEMENT PACTS SUCH AS 'TEAM CONCEPT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a raucous debate that went to the heart of the bitter controversy between 
union leaders and dissidents, the United Auto Workers on Tuesday rejected a 
dissident proposal to curtail the union's new spirit of cooperation with auto 
industry management. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal from the "New Directions" dissident group within the union called 
on the UAW's top officers to "stop using competitiveness as an excuse for 
caving in to management demands." 
</P>
<P>
Introduced as a resolution during the third day of the union's national 
convention at the Anaheim Convention Center, the proposal also called on the 
union to oppose Japanese-style "team concept" labor agreements and other joint 
labor-management programs spreading throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution embraced much of the agenda of the grass-roots dissident 
movement within the UAW, which has gathered strength over the last few months 
as more and more American auto workers have become frustrated with the new 
labor-management programs. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that such programs have been manipulated by industry management 
to subvert the power of the union and to force union members to work harder on 
the shop floor. They also charge that such programs have failed to provide 
workers the job security promised by management, and instead have given 
companies an opportunity to lay off more workers. 
</P>
<P>
"The team concept is a system they in management have used to pit one worker 
against another," said Don Douglas, president of UAW Local 594 in Pontiac, 
Mich., and a leader of the New Directions movement. 
</P>
<P>
But the majority of the convention agreed with the UAW's leadership that the 
union must not return to an old-style, adversarial relationship with 
management. To compete with imports in an international economy, the leadership 
insists that increasing cooperation with management is the only way to keep 
auto jobs in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the leaders say they have not forced team concept labor 
agreements on any local unions that oppose them, and that they remain committed 
to fighting management attempts to manipulate employee involvement programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If some of these programs are bad, then we should fix them," said UAW Vice 
President Don Ephlin. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-delegate convention, dominated by supporters of UAW President Owen 
Bieber, voted overwhelmingly against the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
But not before the dissidents, given ample time during the debate by Bieber, 
who is chairing the six-day convention ending Friday, closed out Tuesday's 
session by getting the last word in on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The team concept is a ploy to disarm our union," complained Lew Moye, a 
dissident who presented the resolution. "What does the Japanese team concept 
mean? It means smaller work forces . . . and a smaller membership for our 
union."

B OF A LENDER LIABILITY CASE GOES BACK TO COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A landmark lender liability case is headed back to court after a Sonoma County 
judge granted two families of apple growers a new trial in their lawsuit 
against Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William L. Bettinelli refused the bank's request that the lawsuit be 
dismissed. In a ruling late Monday afternoon, he said new allegations raised by 
the apple growers open the door for a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the San Francisco bank said the ruling would be appealed, while 
an attorney for the growers claimed that the decision will allow them to prove 
that the bank's actions destroyed the apple growers' business. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was brought by the George M. Jewell family, major apple growers in 
Sebastopol, and the family-owned James O'Connell Co., a major apple processor 
in the Sonoma County town. They claimed that two Bank of America branch 
managers had promised long-term financing for a new processing plant. The 
families claimed that they lost millions of dollars when the bank failed to 
fulfill the promise. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1985, a jury awarded the families $46.7 million. The verdict helped 
create a wave of cases against banks by borrowers who contended that bank 
behavior damaged them. 
</P>
<P>
A judge eventually lowered the award to $26 million, and Bank of America 
appealed the verdict. A year ago, an appeals court overturned the jury's 
verdict and sent the case back to Bettinelli in the lower court. The appeals 
court found no evidence that the bank was responsible for the losses of the 
apple growers and said there was no written contract for the financing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Destroyed Economically' 
</P>
<P>
The narrow definition of the bank's responsibility was viewed by banking 
attorneys as a significant victory for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The bank asked Bettinelli to dismiss the case, but late Monday he said new 
evidence raised by the growers warranted another trial. 
</P>
<P>
A. Barry Cappello, the Santa Barbara lawyer for the growers, said new evidence 
will show that the families were destroyed economically as a direct result of 
the bank's conduct and not by general economic factors and the growers' own 
actions, as claimed by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Samuel Magnani, a Bank of America spokesman, said: "Our view is that, in 
as much as the substantive issues have already been addressed by the courts and 
found to be unsupported by evidence, we are confident that we would prevail in 
any new action they might bring."

Court Orders Manischewitz Vote Delay: An Ohio state court ordered B. 
Manischewitz Co. to postpone until June 30 a shareholder vote on a Beverly 
Hills investment firm's $40.1-million takeover offer. The vote was scheduled 
for Thursday. The delay -- the result of a lawsuit filed by a dissident 
shareholder of Manischewitz -- will give National Foods Inc. more time to nail 
down financing for its own $43.3-million bid for the Jersey City, N.J., 
company. However, if the plaintiff fails to post a $100,000 bond by this 
afternoon, the meeting will proceed as planned, according to Levine, Tessler, 
Leichtman &amp; Co., the Beverly Hills firm whose bid has already been approved 
by Manischewitz's board.

Bond Negotiating to Acquire Stroh: Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. Chairman Alan Bond 
said his Australian brewing conglomerate is negotiating to buy at least part of 
Detroit-based Stroh Brewing, a privately held company that is the No. 3 U.S. 
beer producer. But a stumbling block remains because Bond is seeking a 
controlling interest of Stroh and the Stroh family has said it wants to sell 
only a minority interest. Bond, a yachtsman whose debt-laden Bond Holdings has 
been attempting to weather a recent credit-rating cut and poor results, said he 
would merge his Lacrosse, Wis.-based G. Heileman Brewing Co. with Stroh if the 
negotiations succeed. Bond acquired the No. 5 U.S. brewer, Heileman, in a 
$1.28-billion takeover two years ago.

PARAMOUNT ALLEGES THAT TIME'S BID FOR WARNER IS ILLEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the battle for Time Inc. shifts to a Delaware court, Paramount 
Communications said Tuesday that it will file new documents today alleging that 
Time's $14-billion bid for Warner Communications is, in essence, an illegal 
effort to entrench management. 
</P>
<P>
Time last week spurned a hostile $10.7-billion cash offer from Paramount in 
order to press ahead with its planned merger with Warner. Time's board altered 
its original plan to exchange shares with Warner, however, to avoid putting the 
decision to a shareholder vote. The upshot is that Time will have to borrow 
heavily to acquire Warner, leaving its shareholders with no immediate cash 
payment and a declining stock price. 
</P>
<P>
The price of Time's shares slid another $4.375 Tuesday to close at $152.50. In 
the three days of trading since Time disclosed its strategy, the price has 
dropped $19. 
</P>
<P>
Warner declined 12.5 cents to $59.50, with nearly 2.7 million shares changing 
hands, making it the fourth most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Paramount closed at $59.375, down $1.125, with slightly more than 1 million 
shares traded. 
</P>
<P>
Time's actions enraged some Wall Street traders, who are further frustrated by 
the prospect of another major takeover battle being decided on legal grounds 
instead of economics. More than one professional investor has speculated that 
Paramount may soon increase its $175-per-share bid to step up the pressure on 
Time's directors and institutional investors, and perhaps the court itself as a 
July 11 hearing date approaches. 
</P>
<P>
In an amended complaint due to be filed today, Paramount's lawyers are asking 
the court to enjoin Time from taking steps to complete its offer for Warner, 
now set to expire July 17. Paramount is also asking the court to nullify any 
vote for directors at a Time shareholders meeting set for June 30, where three 
Time executives are among those on the uncontested slate. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount is also asking the court to undo an exchange of shares between Time 
and Warner that occurred last Friday, which Paramount considers a "lockup" 
maneuver to deter other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
On hearing some of Paramount's contentions, Time Vice President Louis J. 
Slovinsky replied: "These appear to be the same specious allegations that 
Paramount has been retailing in the press for days. They can't support their 
claims." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Time and Warner are expected to file replies by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount initially sued Time and Warner on June 7 -- the day it launched its 
hostile bid for Time -- in an effort to overturn some of Time's anti-takeover 
defenses. Paramount lost its first round, however, when Chancellor William T. 
Allen rejected the hostile bidder's request to stop Time and Warner from 
exchanging blocks of stock that left Time with 8.69% of Warner's voting shares 
and left Warner with 11.04% of Time. 
</P>
<P>
The amended Paramount complaint still names as defendants three Time directors 
who resigned in the days immediately after Paramount's offer. The three -- 
Henry C. Goodrich, Clifford J. Grum and Clifton R. Wharton -- were not present 
when the board voted last week to acquire Warner.

IBM TO MARKET PC WITH FAST NEW INTEL CHIP BY YEAR END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International Business Machines scored a public relations victory Tuesday by 
becoming the first company to announce a personal computer containing the 
next-generation microchip from Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The computer will not be entirely new, and it will not be available until the 
end of the year, but analysts saw it as a psychological victory for IBM, which 
has been upstaged repeatedly by its rival, Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
"Compaq must really have bugged them. They have gotten tired of Compaq beating 
them to the market with the latest chip or the fastest chip," said Jonathan 
Seybold, publisher of Seybold Reports in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a shot across the bow from IBM, that's about it," said Richard 
Shaffer, editor of Computer Letter in New York. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said it will sell a $3,995 circuit board containing Intel's new i486 chip. 
The board will replace the microprocessor in one of IBM's Personal System-2 
Model 70-A21 computers, making it run twice as fast as the fastest personal 
computers available today, IBM said. 
</P>
<P>
The circuit board will go on sale as soon as the chips are available from 
Intel, which is expected to be the final quarter of this year. The price of the 
computer they go into was cut to $8,995 from $11,295. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq said the announcement is unimportant because the computer the new chip 
will go into -- the Model 70-A21 -- lacks the memory capacity and room for 
add-on equipment that Compaq's own high-powered models have. The limitations 
mean the computer cannot take full advantage of the new i486 chip's power for 
such jobs as computer-aided design and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq faulted IBM for announcing the product before it is ready. It is 
"absolutely" possible that Compaq will begin delivering a computer based on the 
i486 chip before IBM does, Michael Swavely, the president of Compaq North 
America, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Who announces first really doesn't matter a whole lot," Swavely said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Robert Carberry, IBM's vice president for systems in the personal 
computer organization, said, "I think we're very well positioned" to be the 
first to deliver a computer based on the i486. 
</P>
<P>
The Model 70-A21 was selected as the first housing for the i486 chip because 
its design allows it to accept different microprocessors easily. IBM said other 
members of its PS-2 family would also be equipped with the new chip over time, 
although the upgrade will be more complex. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Compaq brought out the first 80386-based personal computer in 1986, 
IBM has been trying to catch up in unit shipments of those machines, which are 
the most powerful IBM-compatible ones currently on the market. 
</P>
<P>
IBM may hit No. 1 in the segment in the current April-June quarter, David 
Thomas, president of IBM's national distribution division, said in an interview 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that regardless of the technological significance of IBM's 
announcement, they admired the competitive zeal IBM was displaying.

MAI CHIEF QUITS AMID BATTLE FOR PRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president and chief executive of MAI Basic Four has resigned unexpectedly 
amid the company's protracted takeover battle for Prime Computer. 
</P>
<P>
William B. Patton Jr., who is credited with engineering the financial 
turnaround of Tustin-based MAI, is leaving the firm "to devote more time to his 
other personal and business interests," MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Patton's resignation is effective Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He will be temporarily replaced by William Weksel, an MAI board member who 
briefly served as MAI's president in 1985. LeBow and Weksel are business 
partners who together hold a controlling interest in MAI. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Analysts Surprised 
</P>
<P>
Patton, 53, chief executive of the Tustin computer maker since June, 1985, will 
remain on MAI's board and serve as a consultant. He could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expressed surprise at the resignation, which comes at a crucial time 
in MAI's 7-month-long bid to acquire Prime. MAI recently had appeared to be 
moving closer to a merger with Prime, and Patton seemingly has been an 
enthusiastic supporter of the bid. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of months ago when I saw (Patton) face to face he was all gung ho" 
about the merger, said Robert M. Johnson, a Houston technology analyst. "He was 
really fired up." 
</P>
<P>
MAI and Prime officials recently met for the first time since the takeover 
began to discuss MAI's $1.1-billion bid for Prime, a Natick, Mass., maker of 
minicomputers. Last Thursday, Prime agreed to give MAI the same confidential 
company data it has given to several other prospective suitors. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts were puzzled by the timing of the resignation and suggested 
that it could signal a falling out between Patton and LeBow. Although Patton 
has been involved in the bid as chief executive, the deal is being orchestrated 
primarily by LeBow and Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment bank arranging 
most of the financing. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculated that Patton may have left MAI because he was dissatisfied 
with the lesser role he might play if the merger with Prime went through. 
</P>
<P>
But Bertrand H. Weidberg, an MAI senior vice president, said the resignation 
was "unrelated to the Prime bid." 
</P>
<P>
"Bill has said he has some personal and business interests that required more 
time than he could devote while being fully committed as chief executive and 
president," Weidberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Patton, a former Honeywell Inc. executive and president of computer maker Cado 
Systems Inc., joined MAI Basic Four in 1985 as president and chief executive. 
The company's predecessor, Management Assistance Inc., had lost $17.1 million 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Under Patton's leadership, the company sooned returned to profitability and 
went public in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For the year ended Sept. 30, 1988, MAI earned $24.5 million on revenue of 
$420.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, MAI's financial performance has faltered in the current year. For the 
six months ended March 31, earnings fell 34% to $7.9 million, while revenue was 
up 11% to $212.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts blamed MAI's recent financial problems on takeover-related costs, a 
slump in the minicomputer industry and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar 
against certain European currencies, which hurt foreign sales.

LAY DIRECTORS NAMED TO RUN VATICAN BANK ROCKED BY '82 SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
VATICAN CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major shake-up prompted by the scandal that depleted its coffers, the 
Vatican on Tuesday announced appointments to an international board of lay 
directors that will run the Vatican bank. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the board, or Supervisory Council, 
would meet for the first time on July 18, when U.S. Archbishop Paul Marcinkus 
was expected to formally end his involvement with the bank after 18 years as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Marcinkus was caught up in the damaging 1982 scandal in which the bank, known 
officially as the Institute for Religious Work, was linked to the alleged 
fraudulent collapse of Italy's private Banco Ambrosiano. 
</P>
<P>
A statement said the board of five bankers and businessmen from Italy, Spain, 
Switzerland, West Germany and the United States had been named by a control 
commission of cardinals appointed by Pope John Paul II as the bank's supreme 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the 47-year history of the bank that laymen have 
exerted such powerful control over its affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The board will be responsible for the administration and management of the bank 
and will oversee its financial activities in much the same way as the board of 
a commercial bank, Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
It will also nominate a lay director and deputy director to be responsible for 
day-to-day operations, replacing the post of president, and three lay auditors. 
</P>
<P>
The board members, all Catholics, are Angelo Caloia, president of Italy's 
Mediocredito Lombardo; Thomas Macioce, a New York lawyer and chairman of Allied 
Stores Corp.; Jose Angel Sanchez Asiain, president of the Spanish Banco Bilbao 
Vizcaya; Philippe de Weck, a former president of Union de Banques Suisses, and 
Theodor Pietzcer, a director of West German Deutsche Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping reforms were first announced in outline form in March after a 
commission of 15 Roman Catholic cardinals met to discuss the Vatican's mounting 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The changes are widely regarded as a response to calls for greater transparency 
at the Institute for Religious Work, whose links to the Banco Ambrosiano affair 
prompted a drop in contributions to Vatican coffers from Catholics around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican bank owned a small part of Banco Ambrosiano, whose Chairman Roberto 
Calvi was found hanging under London's Blackfriars Bridge shortly after his 
bank collapsed with $1.2 billion in debts. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican denied any responsibility for the scandal but paid $250 million to 
Ambrosiano creditors in what it called a good-will gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's constitutional court last year definitively quashed arrest warrants 
against Marcinkus and two Vatican bank executives on charges of fraudulent 
bankruptcy in the Banco Ambrosiano case. 
</P>
<P>
Marcinkus was asked in March to help with the transition of the bank but his 
future has not been formally announced. Vatican sources say they expect him to 
devote his time to another job he already holds as governor of Vatican City. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's statement said the control commission of cardinals had also appointed 
Italian Monsignor Donato de Bonis to act as prelate to the Institute for 
Religious Work under the new statutes. 
</P>
<P>
De Bonis, currently listed as the bank's secretary general, will essentially be 
a liaison between the control commission and the board, but Navarro-Valls said 
he would have no executive powers.

OIL TRADING VOLATILE, PRICES END MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oil prices ended mixed in volatile trading Tuesday on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange as traders squared their positions on the last day of trading in July 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate -- the benchmark U.S. crude -- sank $1.33 to $19.53 a 
barrel for July delivery, compared to Monday's close of $20.86 a barrel. 
Gasoline rose, but home-heating oil declined. 
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. Gulf Coast spot market, where oil is sold to the highest bidder, 
West Texas Intermediate rose 55 cents to $20.65 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said WTI prices skidded on the Merc as market participants scrambled 
to honor delivery commitments for expiring July contracts and to switch their 
interests into later contract months. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw some active liquidation of the July contract," said Steve Platt, senior 
energy analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said trading volume was light to moderate and WTI fluctuated in price 
by more than $2.25 a barrel during the session. 
</P>
<P>
Platt said crude prices for later months also slipped because traders decided 
that despite the potential for a supply squeeze that buoyed WTI crude prices 
last week, other crudes would be available to take up the slack.

TRIAL OF MILKEN ALLY BEGINS IN NEW YORK

<P>
Opening arguments began Tuesday in the federal racketeering and fraud trial of 
five officials of the now-defunct securities firm Princeton/Newport Partners LP 
and a former Drexel Burnham Lambert trader. 
</P>
<P>
The six are accused of making phony securities trades to generate more than $13 
million in false tax losses for Princeton/Newport from 1984 through 1986. They 
also are accused of illegally manipulating the market price of stock in COMB 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, which is expected to last more than two months, may give the first 
glimpse of some of the government's evidence against former Drexel "junk bond" 
chief Michael Milken, who also is awaiting trial on racketeering and securities 
fraud charges. The case also marks the first use of the federal racketeering 
law against principals of a securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of 'Parking' Stock 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Hansen said the 
government would offer proof that Princeton/Newport engaged in sham securities 
trades with three brokerage firms to create false short-term capital losses and 
long-term capital gains. He said securities were "parked" temporarily with the 
brokerage firms under a secret, illicit agreement to buy them back on a 
specified date at a specified price different from their true market price. 
</P>
<P>
He compared the defendants' alleged parking and later repurchase of the 
securities to the use of a yo-yo, whereby "Princeton/Newport sent these 
securities out with a big string on them, waiting only for the moment when they 
give a little tug on the string and they all come right back into their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said part of the evidence in the case would include a tape recording of 
a telephone conversation between two of the defendants, Charles M. Zarzecki, 
Princeton/Newport's head trader, and Bruce Lee Newberg, then a trader at 
Drexel. Hansen said the tape, seized during a raid on the firm's New Jersey 
offices, recorded Zarzecki confirming that he had sold stock to artificially 
depress the price of COMB common stock, in accordance with a request by 
Newberg. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said the end of the conversation includes the following exchange: 
</P>
<P>
Newberg: "You're a sleaze bag." 
</P>
<P>
Zarzecki: "You taught me, man." 
</P>
<P>
Newberg: "Welcome to the world of being a sleaze." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appropriate, Lawful' 
</P>
<P>
Other defendants in the case include James Sutton Regan, the firm's managing 
general partner, as well as general partners Jack Z. Rabinowitz and Paul A. 
Berkman, and Princeton/Newport controller Steven B. Smotrich. The firm had 
offices in Newport Beach and Princeton, N.J. It was founded in 1969 by Regan 
and Edward Oakley Thorp, a former mathematics professor at UC Irvine. Thorp 
wasn't charged with any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Wells, Regan's lawyer, went first late Tuesday as defense lawyers 
began their opening arguments. He said Regan would take the witness stand in 
his own defense during the trial and testify that all of the trades were 
"appropriate, proper and lawful." He said the trading was done in response to 
changes in federal tax law, and he said Regan gained nothing financially from 
the trades the government claims were illegal. All of the defendants have 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators in the packed courtroom of U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter 
included lawyers for Milken and his brother, Lowell Milken. The Milken case is 
expected to go to trial some time next year, and part of the charges against 
them include allegedly illegal schemes with Princeton/Newport. Newberg is also 
a defendant in that case.

AMERICAN CONTINENTAL SUES REGULATORS FOR $768 MILLION OVER LINCOLN SEIZURE, 
LEAKS 
</P>

The parent company of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan filed court documents Tuesday 
accusing a high-ranking regulatory official of illegally leaking damaging 
information about the Irvine-based thrift to reporters and others. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an amended complaint and a new lawsuit filed by American 
Continental Corp. of Phoenix seek a total of $768 million in damages from 
government defendants, including $568 million for the wrongful confiscation of 
Lincoln by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
In the amended suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, American 
Continental claims that Darrel W. Dochow of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
was among a number of regulators who illegally disclosed "highly confidential 
and inaccurate information" about Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's filings are part of an intensifying courtroom battle over control of 
Lincoln Savings and the financial future of American Continental, its parent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix suit was amended to streamline allegations and to add Dochow as a 
defendant. Other regulators, not yet named, will be added as their identity is 
determined, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The new lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Claims Court in Washington, D.C., claims the 
government seized private property -- Lincoln Savings -- without just 
compensation in violation of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Dochow, director of the bank board's Office of Regulatory Affairs, and other 
bank board executives could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental, headquartered in Phoenix, filed a petition on April 13 to 
protect itself from creditors while it tries to reorganize its debts under 
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. The bank board seized Lincoln the 
next day, saying the company was operating it unsafely and dissipating its $5.3 
billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental's chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., has maintained that 
regulators illegally leaked confidential information in a vendetta against his 
company and Lincoln. Keating has claimed that government officials resented his 
vocal opposition to new rules limiting the kinds of investments S&amp;Ls can 
make. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing Tuesday's legal actions, Keating said in a prepared statement 
that the "improper leaks" damaged and continue to damage Lincoln and American 
Continental by contributing to a loss of deposits, decreased market value for 
American Continental stock and the "termination or impairment of important 
banking and other business relationships." 
</P>
<P>
In the amended suit filed in Phoenix, American Continental seeks $200 million 
in compensatory and punitive damages for wrongful leaks and injunctions against 
further leaks and other violations by the bank board. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Dochow was the "unidentified regulatory official" who was 
quoted in a news report in March as saying that "Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
must be sold quickly or it will be seized." 
</P>
<P>
That comment caused a "serious run" on Lincoln's deposits, the suit said. 
Company officials have said previously that depositors withdrew $70 million in 
the days following that report, and Keating said total deposits have plummeted 
by $400 million since regulators seized it. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also accuses the bank board of violating its own rules by using Kevin 
O'Connell, an examiner who was allegedly biased against Lincoln, in its 
investigation of the S&amp;L. His father, William, severely criticized 
Lincoln's operations while he was head of an S&amp;L trade group, the suit 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violation Claimed 
</P>
<P>
In the new suit filed in Washington, American Continental is seeking $568 
million in damages resulting from the seizure of Lincoln. The suit claims the 
bank board violated a 1988 agreement between Lincoln and regulators over how 
the agency would conduct a new examination of the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is in addition to a previous one filed there that seeks to overturn 
the conservatorship imposed by regulators and to return control of the S&amp;L 
to the company.

SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON SEEKING BIGGER PIECE OF MORTGAGE-SERVICING PIE

Large mortgage bankers don't make their money by selling the loans they 
originate to investors. They generate most of their income from fees they 
charge for servicing those loans -- sending out bills, collecting payments and 
paying taxes and insurance for the investors. 
</P>
<P>
And it is a big business. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Co. in Newport Beach, one of the nation's 
largest mortgage bankers, was servicing more than $14.1 billion in loans at the 
end of December. That made it the nation's sixth largest -- and California's 
largest -- mortgage servicing firm last year, according to American Banker, a 
daily trade newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Though the company would not reveal financial details, mortgage firms typically 
receive a fee of about 0.4% of the loan amounts they service, the American 
Banker said. That's $60 million in revenue for a firm servicing $15 billion in 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
The company expects its servicing unit to grow even larger this year. It is 
considering the purchase of servicing rights to $5 billion in loans, said 
Walter P. Blass, the firm's chairman and president. 
</P>
<P>
The company, a subsidiary of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., also is negotiating 
to build a 150,000-square-foot structure to house enough servicing operations 
to handle up to $50 billion in loans. The company plans to build on one of four 
sites near its current San Bernardino servicing center. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is not to be the biggest servicer, just the best servicer and the most 
profitable one, Blass said. The biggest is Citicorp Mortgage Inc., a St. Louis 
subsidiary of New York's giant Citicorp banking company. Its servicing 
portfolio had $52.2 billion in loans last year. 
</P>
<P>
There is certainly room to grow. Despite its size, Citicorp had less than 2% of 
the market. In fact, the top 100 mortgage servicing operations accounted for 
less than 20% of the $3 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt, according to the 
American Banker.

Landmark Bank in La Habra is offering a new certificate of deposit that allows 
depositors to continue adding money to the account during the term of the CD. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, depositors cannot add to a CD during its term. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark's new savings program, called the CD Plus, requires a minimum opening 
deposit of $20,000, allows additional deposits in minimum increments of $1,000 
and limits the total balance to $500,000. The CD is renewed automatically at 
the interest rate prevailing at renewal time.

Crazy Eddie Inc., the flamboyant electronics retailer, filed for protection 
from creditors Tuesday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code but 
pledged to keep its stores open. 
</P>
<P>
Five creditors had filed a petition for involuntary bankruptcy against Crazy 
Eddie on June 6, seeking to recover $860,000. 
</P>
<P>
The company initially said it would fight to have the filing dismissed. But 
Peter A. Martosella, acting president and chief executive officer, said the 
petition caused a series of problems that forced Crazy Eddie to turn to Chapter 
11. 
</P>
<P>
"The action of the five creditors, which we believe was ill-advised, caused a 
disruption in our bank-credit facility and related business and cash flow 
problems requiring the company to seek the protection afforded it under Chapter 
11 of the bankruptcy code," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Martosella added that the company had been negotiating an out-of-court debt 
restructuring with its creditors.

PROGRAM TRIES TO HELP FEMALE EXECUTIVES GAIN LOAN LITERACY

Women own more than a quarter of all small U.S. companies, but a women's 
economic development group maintains that many of these entrepreneurs still 
don't have the financial savvy to write a credible loan application. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Fitzpatrick, president and founder of American Woman's Economic 
Development Corp., said women's uneasiness with the financial end of business 
is cultural. 
</P>
<P>
"Most women who come here are wonderful at the creative end but haven't learned 
the business end," she said. "They've been given the message one way or another 
. . . that this is not something they should be concerned with." 
</P>
<P>
The trend is especially disturbing because almost 50% of all small companies 
will be run by women by the turn of the century, according to Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in the country's history that more women than men are 
going into business for themselves," she said. "It's such a wonderful avenue 
for people to advance and improve their lives." 
</P>
<P>
In view of these statistics, American Woman's Economic Development Corp. has 
developed a new program designed to raise the standard of loan literacy among 
female entrepreneurs in New York state. 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed for the female executive whose business has been 
growing steadily or the woman who is just preparing to set up a company. 
</P>
<P>
The course consists of 10 to 13 two-hour, private counseling sessions that give 
executives tips on how to write a business history, project the financial 
performance of their companies and assemble data that will build credibility 
with a lending institution.

'IN A REBUILDING PERIOD'; 
</P>
<P>
RETIRING MACHINISTS CHIEF SAYS UNIONS STILL NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he prepares to step down as president of the International Assn. of 
Machinists this month, William Winpisinger is confident that organized labor 
has a bright future. But he says he's worried that union leaders will revert to 
their old ways when the pendulum of power swings back in labor's direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't believe we're seeing the funeral mass being said over us. I can't 
even hear the strains of the organ dirge," says the outspoken union leader who 
retires after 38 years in the labor movement. "As long as people work, sooner 
or later, no matter how benevolent or paternalistic an employer may be, workers 
run into problems on their jobs. And when they do, they need some kind of 
mechanism to adjudicate those problems." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of some other mechanism for assuring fairness, Winpisinger says, 
workers will turn to unions for help. "As our tarnished image begins to accept 
polish again the phone will begin to ring," he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, he says, organized labor is going through "just another rebuilding 
period that we essentially had to go through, partly because of the way we 
conducted our own institution." In fact, it is the way that labor conducted 
itself in the past that concerns him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Magic to It' 
</P>
<P>
"In my judgment," he says, "the challenge for labor leadership in the future is 
one, and one only: When the country does see fit to repose power in the hands 
of labor leadership that it has to be used more wisely and judiciously than 
ever in our history. It has to be used responsibly, not recklessly, not 
wantonly, but very, very responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
As he sees it, organized labor can no longer use power "totally for its own 
grand design." He said he did not agree with the philosophy of the late AFL-CIO 
President George Meany, who, he says, believed that "the use of unbridled power 
was not sinful." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to be prepared to try to discipline ourselves so as not to indulge 
in the excesses that will cause the pendulum to take another violent swing in 
the future," he says. "There's no magic to it. It takes a lot of work, a lot of 
persuasion. It takes a hell of a leader." 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, Winpisinger says, labor leaders must spend less time 
worrying about wages and more time worrying about broader social issues that 
affect workers. "It's going to require a leader who can lead on the social and 
philosophical side as the beacon on which you moderate economic behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Winpisinger says this doesn't mean unions should no longer be militant or 
strike. Citing the example of Eastern Air Lines, where the IAM is locked in a 
bitter struggle for control of the carrier, Winpisinger says: "Obviously, if 
someone wants to fight, you've got to take them on." 
</P>
<P>
But Winpisinger sees no room in the future for wage settlements at one firm 
being goals that unions at other companies or in other industries insist on 
beating. The result, he says, is "terrible distortions" that "drive the whole 
wage totem pole out of kilter." He insists that there must be a recognition 
among union leaders that some jobs deserve more pay than others. 
</P>
<P>
Winpisinger, who takes pride in being viewed as a leader of labor's political 
left wing, cites the experience of unions in Western Europe as the direction 
U.S. labor go. In Europe, he says, trade unions are part of the mainstream of 
government policy-making and help set economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the future of labor-management cooperation in the United States as 
American industries scramble to be competitive in world markets, Winpisinger 
insists that problem is related to the need for labor to have a voice in social 
and economic policy. And he doesn't see the effort to be competitive going very 
far unless business changes its tactics toward labor. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation is a two-way street," he says. "And I don't consider it 
cooperation if I sit down on behalf of our members and make a deal . . . and we 
give up a lot of work rules that may or may not have outlived their usefulness, 
we put on a good show in terms of production and the company makes a buck and 
we make a buck.

SUNSHINY 'STORY OF ORANGE COUNTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're looking for a critical, detailed history of Orange County, don't look 
for it on KOCE-TV's "The Story of Orange County," which airs tonight at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute program -- really a series of three shorter segments -- paints 
the history of the county in broad brush strokes and, for the most part, in a 
favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is "one of the most affluent and technologically advanced 
counties in the country," the program's narrator tells us up front. "A dream 
come true." 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes and no. Orange County may be a realized dream for thousands of 
affluent homeowners and the descendants of early county settlers interviewed in 
this program, which is also being made available to local schools. But "The 
Story of Orange County" skims -- or ignores completely -- the history of less 
fortunate groups in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there is much to marvel at in Orange County, and producer-director 
Bill McGarigle has done a good job of obtaining original photos and film and 
interviewing people who made history in the county, or their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
The program attempts to cover a lot of ground. It begins with the American 
Indians who populated the area before the Spaniards, the program says, wiped 
them out with foreign diseases. It concludes 90 minutes later with Santa 
Margarita Co. President Tony Moiso talking about the challenges that lie ahead 
for county developers, who, like the Spaniards of yesteryear, unwittingly 
introduce new environmental and cultural afflictions in the interests of 
evangelizing all concerned to their notion of proper life style. (The Santa 
Margarita Co. is also one of the show's sponsors.) 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of useful, interesting information in between. The show's first 
"storyteller," Paul Apodaca, curator of folk art at Santa Ana's Bowers Museum, 
tells us that American Indians in what is now Orange County were blessed with 
abundant food sources and had enough time to become world-class artisans. One 
wonders why, given that same abundance today, Orange County is not more of a 
cultural powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardo Yorba, a descendant of Jose Antonio Yorba, a member of the first 
Spanish expedition into the area and recipient of the first land grant, tells 
of the early ranchos, the huge, private landholdings that helped determine the 
master-planned character of south county development more than a century later. 
</P>
<P>
The program draws other parallels between past and present: Orange County 
voters have been shortsighted and tight-fisted for more than a century. Voters 
in what later became Orange County opposed floating bonds to pay for expansion 
of railroad service into their area in the 19th Century, just as voters shot 
down a sales-tax increase a few years ago that would have paid for new roads to 
help relieve the traffic on crowded old ones. 
</P>
<P>
And Bob Main, a Garden Grove builder, says that driving around Orange County 
during the postwar suburban explosion, it "seemed like there was a new project 
somewhere every day." Some things never change. 
</P>
<P>
The show makes no mention of some of Orange County's darker chapters: the last 
lynching in California, the power wielded by the Ku Klux Klan and John Birch 
Society earlier this century, the internment of some of the county's prominent 
Japanese farmers at Manzanar during World War II, and discriminatory laws and 
practices against Mexicans and other ethnic groups that continued even after 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
"The Story of Orange County" is a history of high points -- Disneyland, the Big 
A, the freeways, the oil explosion, South Coast Plaza and the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, and the remarkable economic growth of the past two 
decades. All of that is without question part of Orange County's history, but 
it is only that -- a part. The rest of "The Story" remains to be told. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Story of Orange County" airs at 8 p.m. tonight on KOCE Channel 50.

stricken Soviet cruise liner said today that the ship was traveling much too 
fast when it smashed into a belt of Arctic ice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the exact speed but I was told by crew on board that it had a 
speed of between 14 and 17 knots at the time of the accident," Sigurd Kleiven, 
commander of the coast guard vessel Senja, told a shipboard news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how fast he would have been going in such foggy conditions with drifting 
ice around, he replied: "Between two and three knots."

Federal Reserve Board Gov. H. Robert Heller announced today that he is 
resigning, effective July 31, citing the decision by Congress earlier this year 
to reject a pay increase for top federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Heller, a Ronald Reagan appointee from California who served on the Fed board 
for three years, stressed that he is resigning for personal reasons and not 
because of any policy differences with the six other members of the Federal 
Reserve Board. "I certainly wouldn't go if pay wasn't an issue," he told 
reporters. Heller's salary was $82,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Heller -- formerly head of international research for the Bank of America -- 
will join VISA International, the credit card company, in San Francisco as an 
executive vice president in charge of relations with 21,000 member banks and 
public officials.

<P>
 School police are investigating a series of possible end-of-the-year vandalism 
pranks at two high schools in Woodland Hills, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism, discovered since last weekend, includes the cutting down of four 
trees at El Camino Real High School and the moving of furniture and the 
abandoning of a sheep at Taft High School. 
</P>
<P>
At El Camino Real, in the 5400 block of Valley Circle Boulevard, staff members 
found windows of some classrooms painted and four trees cut down in a courtyard 
Monday morning, Principal Martin King said. Three of the trees were more than 
30 feet tall, and the fourth was an oak tree recently planted in memory of a 
teacher who died this year. 
</P>
<P>
Taft Principal Ron Berz said staff members this morning found outdoor benches 
and tables stacked in a courtyard at the school at Winnetka Avenue and Ventura 
Boulevard. A sheep was also found along with a sign that said Class of '89. He 
said sunflower seeds were found strewn around school rooms.

China executed three protesters in public today and up to 17 others were 
condemned to die for their roles in student-led demonstrations that challenged 
the power of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The executions of the three Shanghai men were carried out hours after futile 
appeals for clemency by President Bush and other Western leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai workers were convicted of setting a train on fire on June 6 after 
it plowed into a barricade set up by protesters, killing six people. 
</P>
<P>
They were shot to death in front of a crowd just 2 1/2 hours after Shanghai's 
highest court rejected their appeals, a spokesman at the city's Foreign Affairs 
Office said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Nations Revolted 
</P>
<P>
Washington called the executions regrettable but said it planned no further 
sanctions, while other Western nations expressed revulsion. 
</P>
<P>
"We deeply regret the fact that these executions have gone forward," Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III said in the first official U.S. reaction. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker, speaking outside the White House, added: "The United States is not 
contemplating any additional action at this time" because President Bush 
believes that the U.S. sanctions taken thus far have been "appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction elsewhere in the West was less measured. 
</P>
<P>
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said the executions filled 
him with "abhorrence, bitterness and deep sadness." In London, Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher said she was "utterly appalled." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Atrocious' Executions 
</P>
<P>
France, Spain and the Netherlands said the European Community will take up the 
question of its relations with Beijing at next week's EC summit in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said links with Beijing will be reviewed 
after the "atrocious" executions. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van den Broek said: "This new, sad development can 
only lead to a further deterioration of relations." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng denounced the foreign criticism. 
</P>
<P>
He told visiting Foreign Secretary Humayun Khan of Pakistan that most of the 
millions of Chinese who took part nationwide in marches, sit-ins and hunger 
strikes for a freer society will be treated leniently "even if they had 
extremist opinions." 
</P>
<P>
But Li said, "The tiny minority of criminals will be punished according to the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Army Fired on Students 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first top-level contact with a foreign delegation since the 
crackdown began June 3-4, when the army fired on students and supporters in 
Beijing to end their pro-democracy demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those sentenced to death today, 11 -- including the three 
executed -- were condemned previously. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing radio said 45 people who "seriously endangered public order" were tried 
in front of an audience of 10,000 people in Jinan in eastern China's Shandong 
province. 
</P>
<P>
It did not give details of their alleged crimes, but said some were given the 
death penalty.

COURT LIMITS STATE POWER TO PUNISH MEDIA; 
</P>
<P>
AWARD AGAINST PAPER THAT PUBLISHED NAME OF RAPE VICTIM VOIDED

<P>
The Supreme Court, in a case stemming from publication of a rape victim's name, 
today limited the power of states to punish the news media for reporting 
truthful, lawfully obtained information. 
</P>
<P>
By a 6-3 vote, the court threw out a $97,500 award against a Florida weekly 
newspaper won by a rape victim whose identify was included in a published 
report about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said the award violates free press rights protected by the 
Constitution's First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Crime in Florida 
</P>
<P>
Florida law makes it a crime to "print, publish or broadcast" the names of 
victims of sexual offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Our holding today is limited," Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not hold that truthful publication is automatically constitutionally 
protected, or that there is no zone of privacy within which the state may 
protect the individual from intrusion by the press," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision also did not preclude the possibility of a state punishing 
publication of a sex offense victim's name, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthful information which it 
has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully be imposed, if at all, only when 
narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest order." 
</P>
<P>
That interest was not present in the Florida case, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida Star, a newspaper that primarily serves the black community in 
Jacksonville, could have been put out of business if forced to pay the award, 
its lawyers had told the justices. 
</P>
<P>
The Star obtained the rape victim's name, identified in court documents only by 
the initials B.J.F., from a report posted in the Sheriff's Department press 
room in the fall of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Most news organizations, including the Florida Star, have policies against 
publication of rape victim's names. But publication of B.J.F.'s name occurred 
erroneously, the newpaper's lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
In another case today, the court gave a partial victory to the Internal Revenue 
Service in its legal battles with the Church of Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
The justices ruled 8 to 0 that judges can privately examine communications 
between lawyers and clients to determine whether such information should be 
turned over to the government.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the chairman of the U.S. Joint 
Chiefs of Staff today that his visit is evidence that the superpowers are 
viewing each other more as partners than as adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Adm. William J. Crowe said, "There is change afoot in this 
country, politically and militarily," adding that he found Gorbachev "very 
impressive." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev met with Crowe in a Kremlin office on the last day of a 10-day visit 
in which the admiral viewed military exercises in Byelorussia, looked at a 
Soviet nuclear submarine and traveled widely in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extremely Significant' 
</P>
<P>
"The very fact that you have visited the Soviet Union and have visited military 
facilities and units demonstrates that we are moving from the notion of enemies 
to the notion of partners," Gorbachev told Crowe in the presence of a handful 
of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that in the plans made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we are still 
considered to be adversaries, but the process is going along new lines, and 
this is extremely significant," the Soviet leader said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe, accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock, then met with Gorbachev, 
his military adviser Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev and military Chief of Staff 
Mikhail A. Moiseyev for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there still are differences in our points of view," especially on 
arms control, Crowe said at a news conference later. But, he added, "the 
atmosphere for discussing them has improved markedly. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we now have an environment in which we can talk candidly, ask the 
kinds of questions that are important; we can talk without rancor or emotion," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said Gorbachev's plan to withdraw 500 tactical nuclear weapons from 
Eastern Europe and President Bush's proposals on reducing conventional forces 
make him optimistic about superpower arms talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We now believe there are some positive offers, some constructive offers on the 
table, that both sides are serious and sincere and that we can now continue the 
process of negotiations and some optimism," Crowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe's visit followed a trip by Akhromeyev to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The visit came as the United States and Soviet Union resumed talks in Geneva on 
reducing their arsenals of strategic nuclear missiles, negotiations that were 
stalled by disagreements and the change of U.S. administration. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides also are engaged in negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons, 
chemical weapons and conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe spent much of his visit assessing changes in Soviet military policy under 
Gorbachev.

One-third of the estimated 3.7 million births in the year ended in June, 1988, 
were to women in their 30s, a dramatic increase from the 19% in 1976, the 
Census Bureau said today. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau, in its annual survey of the fertility of American women, also said 
that the number of premaritally conceived first births has risen sharply over 
the last 15 years and that 22% of women between 18 and 44 who had a child in 
the previous year were not married. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Census Bureau said the fertility rate was 69.7 births per 1,000 
women. Hispanic women had the highest fertility rate, 94 births per 1,000, and 
accounted for 11% of all births in the survey period although they make up only 
8% of women in the U.S. between 18 and 44 years old.

EMPLOYEES PAYING MORE OF MEDICAL BILLS, STUDY FINDS

<P>
Salaried employees of large U.S. companies are paying a bigger share of their 
medical expenses than they did five years ago, according to a 
soon-to-be-released study of employee benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt Associates, a suburban Chicago consulting firm, conducted the survey of 
227 major employers. 
</P>
<P>
Medical plans are paying more catastrophic-illness costs but employees are 
paying a larger share of other medical expenses, researchers discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt found that just 29% of the survey respondents' medical plans covered 
100% of hospital room and board charges, compared with 53% in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The more typical practice is for the plan to cover 80% of hospital charges and 
require employees to pay 20% up to a specified maximum, usually $2,000 or less. 
The plan then kicks in and pays 100%. 
</P>
<P>
Employers also are trying to better manage medical costs by encouraging 
employees to seek second surgical opinions and have medical tests done on an 
outpatient basis. 
</P>
<P>
Workers also face a wider array of employer-sponsored savings plans, and are 
increasingly being asked to take a more active role in designing their own 
benefits packages. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a desire among employers to involve employees more in all aspects of 
benefits," said Howard Levin, a partner in Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense that when employees participate, they get involved more and 
have a greater appreciation" of their benefits, Levin said in a telephone 
interview from his Lincolnshire office. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Hewitt found that 62% of companies surveyed offered the same medical 
coverage for surgery whether or not the employee got a second opinion. In 1988, 
only 29% of the respondents offered the same coverage regardless of whether a 
second opinion was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
"Cost-sharing causes people to be more careful consumers of health-care 
services," Levin said. "The employee who has to pay for part of any service 
(used) is going to use more discretion."

In an assessment of current economic conditions, the Federal Reserve said today 
that overall inflationary pressures do not appear to be accelerating and the 
economy is still growing. 
</P>
<P>
The economic review in the so-called Tan Book issued about every six weeks is 
one of the tools used by Fed governors in adjusting monetary policy. The 
Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions regulating the money 
supply, is scheduled to meet next July 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed report said, "With some exceptions, wage and price pressures are not 
accelerating." It noted that in some areas, businesses have been unable to pass 
on increased costs to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales were "generally positive," but auto sales fell, manufacturing 
growth leveled off and real estate markets were sluggish, the Fed said. Some 
areas reported "undesirably" high inventories, particularly in autos, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that firming oil prices helped energy-producing regions and that 
recent rains eased drought problems in a number of areas. Environmentally 
related legal disputes restricted lumber supplies, it said.

the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon, Chrysler said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1 million vehicles will be involved, Chrysler said. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler introduced driver's side air bags as standard equipment on six car 
lines late in the 1988 model year. By the end of the 1989 model year, the 
company estimates it already will have produced more than 250,000 cars with the 
safety device. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler also said it will offer anti-lock brake systems as standard equipment

to halt Time's bid for Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
"Paramount Communications is alleging a deliberate persistent pattern of 
entrenchment moves by management, which shuts out the owners of Time -- its 
shareholders," a Paramount spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount has bid $175 a share for Time, which rejected the offer and said it 
would continue to pursue a merger with Warner.

EVERT WITHDRAWS FROM PRE-WIMBLEDON MATCH; 
</P>
<P>
MAY MISS FAVORITE TOURNAMENT; INNER EAR INFECTION BLAMED

<P>
Chris Evert withdrew today from Wimbledon's major warm-up tournament because of 
an ear infection and may miss next week's Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
Evert skipped the French Open a month ago, citing lack of motivation after 
losing twice to low-ranked players. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to the United States, there was speculation that she also 
might bypass Wimbledon, but after a few days' rest, Evert said she would 
compete in that event because it is her favorite tournament. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for Wimbledon, where she is seeded fourth, and to gain match 
fitness, Evert entered this week's $300,000 Virginia Slims event at Eastbourne. 
</P>
<P>
Evert was scheduled to play a third-round match today against Raffaella Reggi 
of Italy after two easy victories. But she defaulted because of an inner ear 
infection that doctors said leaves her feeling sick and dizzy every time she 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Wilson, a physician, said the infection could clear up in two days or 
could last longer than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Evert would be fit to play her first-round match at Wimbledon, 
scheduled for Tuesday, Wilson said: "That I cannot say. . . . No one can be 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
If Evert misses Wimbledon, in which she has reached at least the semifinals in 
16 of her 17 appearances since she first played in 1972, she may never play in 
the tournament again. 
</P>
<P>
Although she spurned talk of immediate retirement, Evert said this week that 
she would not continue playing for long and that she wants to raise a family.

N.Y. YANKS TRADE HENDERSON TO ATHLETICS; 
</P>
<P>
4TH-LEADING BASE STEALER OF ALL TIME SWAPPED FOR 2 PITCHERS, OUTFIELDER

<P>
Rickey Henderson, the fourth-leading base stealer of all-time, was traded by 
the New York Yankees to the Oakland Athletics today for pitchers Greg Cadaret 
and Eric Plunk and outfielder Luis Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who is in the last year of a five-year contract and has been unhappy 
with what the Yankees have been offering him, was hitting .247 with 25 stolen 
bases this season. He has 819 career stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson was acquired by the Yankees from Oakland on Dec. 8, 1984, and signed 
a five-year contract. He had said the Yankees had until the All-Star break to 
sign him and was said to be looking for a three-year deal worth more than $8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the fine performance he's given us during his 4 1/2 years with 
the Yankees and wish him all the best in his return to Oakland," Yankees Vice 
President Syd Thrift said of Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"With the addition of Plunk and Cadaret, we'll strengthen our pitching staff 
considerably. Polonia gives us an offensive spark not only at the plate but 
also on the bases." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's best season with the Yankees was 1985, when he hit .314 with 24 
home runs, 72 RBIs and 80 stolen bases while scoring 146 runs. 
</P>
<P>
He batted .263 in 1986, but still stole 87 bases and scored 130 runs, then was 
limited to 95 games in 1987 due to a leg injury, batting .291 with 41 stolen 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he rebounded to hit .305 with 93 stolen bases, though he hit only 
six home runs. 
</P>
<P>
He set the modern major league record for steals in 1982 with 130 while with 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Cadaret, a 27-year-old left-hander who was Oakland's first draft pick in June, 
1983, was 0-0 with a 2.28 earned-run average in 26 games this season. He is in 
his third major league season and has an 11-4 lifetime record. 
</P>
<P>
Plunk, 25, is a hard-throwing right-hander who was 1-1 with one save and a 2.20 
ERA in 23 games. He came to the Athletics from the Yankees in the trade that 
sent Henderson to New York. He is 16-16 lifetime with eight saves. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia, 24, was hitting .286 with 13 stolen bases.

ABDUL-JABBAR NOT SEEKING ITALIAN DEAL, PUBLICIST SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times wire services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is seeking a $1-million contract to play pro 
basketball in Italy next year is not true, his publicist said today. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, the 7-foot-2 star of the Lakers, retired at the end of the 
National Basketball Assn. playoffs at the age of 42. The Italian report "is not 
true, he is not seeking any type of long-term basketball contract and has not 
received any kind of offer for that kind of money," said publicist Lorin 
Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm committed to games on a worldwide basis," said Abdul-Jabbar in a statement 
issued by his publicist. "I'm not sure I want to be in regular team competition 
again." 
</P>
<P>
An Italian sports daily, Corriere Dello Sport, said this week that two Italian 
pro teams were reported bidding for Abdul-Jabbar's services, and that he was 
seeking $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, who has appeared in a handful of movies and television shows in 
recent years, is concentrating on the entertainment field and serving as a 
"basketball ambassador," his publicist said. He is traveling to Australia and 
Taiwan next month to play exhibitions with a team of former NBA stars against 
national teams. The games are in Melbourne, July 24; Sydney, July 26; Brisbane, 
July 28, and Taipei, July 30.

John McEnroe's Wimbledon preparations received an unexpected jolt today when he 
was beaten 3-6, 7-6, 7-6 by fellow American Jim Pugh in the second round of a 
grass-court warm-up tournament. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, the No. 2 seed at the Wirral International and seeded fifth at 
Wimbledon next week, gained the only service break in the match as he took the 
opening set, but was edged in both tiebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
Pugh is ranked 88th in the world and is a doubles specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the three-time Wimbledon champion said he is not discouraged and 
will be going into next week's Grand Slam event with his hopes still high. He 
plays Australia's Darren Cahill in the first round.

Oklahoma University regents today approved the hiring of Gary Gibbs as head 
football coach and gave Barry Switzer, who resigned Monday, a $225,000 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, who has spent his entire collegiate coaching career as an assistant at 
the university, was given a salary of $88,000. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement for Switzer included a $145,000 lump payment on June 1, 1990. It 
also provided that Switzer will be paid a salary of $7,250 a month while on 
"special assignment" until Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer resigned following six months of turmoil after the school received a 
three-year NCAA probation and five players were charged in incidents involving 
guns, drugs and sexual assault. He had four years left on his contract.
