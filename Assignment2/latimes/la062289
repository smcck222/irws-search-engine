NEWSMAKERS: IN TRUTH, SHAMIR'S LIE GAVE HIM ENTRY TO NEW HOME

It was a case, argued Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, where the end 
justified the means, as the Jewish leader confessed that he lied extensively to 
gain entrance to Palestine from Poland as a young man of 20. In 1935, 
restrictions for living in Palestine, which the British ruled under a League of 
Nations mandate, were such that Shamir judged the only way he could get in 
would be to apply to study at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In the 
application, Shamir fibbed that he had studied law for a year at Warsaw 
University to please his parents but that Hebrew literature was his true love. 
The letter "wasn't too accurate a description of my feelings," Shamir conceded 
in a speech to 600 Israelis who were able to escape the Nazi Holocaust by 
gaining acceptance to the university. Once there, "I wanted to study," Shamir 
said, but "I got involved in other things." In 1940, he became a founder and 
leader of the Stern Gang, which carried out a campaign of political 
assassinations and bombings to force an end to British rule in Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Working full time is no excuse not to get involved, declared the new 
national director of the PTA, who becomes the first woman to head the 
organization while also maintaining a full-time career. Ann Lynch, 64, the 
public relations director at Humana Hospital Sunrise in Las Vegas, vowed to 
overhaul the image of the 6.6-million-member group. "The PTA is not an 
organization for homemakers," she said. "It is for parents and others who care 
about young people. . . . You can work full time and be involved. Just because 
you work is no excuse."

<P>
 -- An infant boy with severe burns was the first beneficiary of an Illinois 
man's decision to donate four square feet of his excess skin to a hospital burn 
unit. Through dieting, Dennis Genz had shed 170 pounds but was left with a 
large flap of skin on his abdomen, which was removed surgically Monday. Some of 
the 19 1/2 pounds of skin and adjoining tissue went to Dexter Moore, a 
3-month-old Indiana fire victim. "There have been rare cases where parents have 
donated skin for their children," said Betty Perls, education director for the 
Regional Organ Bank of Illinois. "But none of us have ever heard of a case like 
this." ANN CONNORS

AL MARTINEZ: A SECOND LOOK AT MISS ETHEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was sitting at a lunch counter in Santa Monica the other day, waiting for my 
wife, when I overhead a conversation by two old ladies. 
</P>
<P>
One of them said, "I had a vision this morning. I think it was God." 
</P>
<P>
"Is that so," said the second old lady. "What did he look like?" 
</P>
<P>
The first old lady thought for a moment and then said, "Who was that on 
'Fantasy Island?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Tattoo?" 
</P>
<P>
"The other one." 
</P>
<P>
"Ricardo Montalban." 
</P>
<P>
"Him." 
</P>
<P>
"That's amazing," the second old lady said. "I would think God would look more 
like Anthony Quinn." 
</P>
<P>
I had been slumped in a waiting mode, which is a state of suspended animation 
adopted by husbands who do a lot of hanging around. But with that snippet of 
conversation I came alert. 
</P>
<P>
"Did he say anything?" the second old lady asked. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Don't eat pork.' " 
</P>
<P>
The second old lady nodded somberly. "That's good advice," she said . 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to ask if the voice also sounded like Ricardo Montalban, but it 
occurred to me that I was playing with fire here, so I left the counter 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
I am out of the business of teasing old ladies. Miss Ethel is very much on my 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
For those who missed it, I poked a little fun recently at a hospital gift shop 
volunteer, the aforementioned Miss Ethel, by re-creating my frustrating effort 
to buy magazines and flowers from her. 
</P>
<P>
She wouldn't take my credit card ("This isn't the Miami Hilton"), doubted my 
driver's license and only grudgingly accepted a check. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ethel was crotchety and funny so I wrote a crotchety and funny column. 
Well, it seemed funny at the time. 
</P>
<P>
At one point I said that hospital gift shops had become the province of old 
ladies with time on their hands, and you'd think I had suggested a form of 
genocide limited to elderly female volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The phone began ringing off the hook and after taking the first outraged call 
or two I decided to let it ring. The messages left on my answering machine 
proved it was a wise decision. They ranged from mild reprimands to a word with 
an obscene reference I am not allowed to use. 
</P>
<P>
Then the mail came. 
</P>
<P>
"I write to strongly object . . . " Mary Oberle began. 
</P>
<P>
"You owe us an apology . . . " Madeline Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have hit a new low . . . " Mollie Davis and Sylvia Klenesty wrote 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Mollie composed the content and Sylvia did the typing. The last line of 
their letter was, "Believe me -- YOU ARE NO JACK SMITH!" 
</P>
<P>
Well, believe me, Mollie and Sylvia, YOU ARE NO ERMA BOMBECK! 
</P>
<P>
"You have a lot to learn about gift shops, Sonny Boy," wrote Jewell Rosier. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about deja vu. My mother used to call me Sonny Boy while shaking her 
finger at me. 
</P>
<P>
"You're no big butter and egg man, Sonny Boy," she'd say. I didn't even know 
what a big butter and egg man was. I still don't. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen letter-writers hated the column and four loved it. Well, 15 hated it 
if you count Mollie and Sylvia separately. Among those who loved it was Eddie 
Mc. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Mc wrote, "Your column . . . was a jewel. Would you believe that you and 
the Metro section are what The Times is about with most of the inmates here at 
Hall of Justice jail?" 
</P>
<P>
It was a brilliant letter, full of wit and wisdom, and I'm sure that Eddie was 
unfairly convicted of whatever he is in the slammer for. HANG IN THERE, EDDIE 
Mc! 
</P>
<P>
Eddie's note, written in longhand on yellow legal paper, counteracted a formal 
letter of complaint filed by Eleanor Roche, who is president of the Southern 
California Assn. of the Directors of Volunteer Services. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor wrote that I had single-handedly insulted 100,000 volunteers in 200 
hospitals. That gave me a momentary flash of pride until I realized she hadn't 
meant it as a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
I had abased not only the old ladies who volunteer, she suggested, but the very 
concept of Volunteerism itself. Didn't I know that volunteers also cuddled 
newborn babies and helped maintain quality patient care? 
</P>
<P>
Everybody stay calm. I have no quarrel with volunteers. The idea of Miss Ethel 
holding a newborn might give me pause, but I'm sure someone will be standing by 
in case the slippery little dear should, you know, wiggle out its delivery 
blanket and go plunk on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, I salute all the Miss Ethels of the world who give time and energy 
toward helping humanity, AND THAT GOES FOR MOLLIE AND SYLVIA! 
</P>
<P>
Funny, but just as I wrote that, a voice said, "Nice going, Martinez." It 
sounded amazingly like Ricardo Montalban.

Ronald Reagan receives a knighthood from Buckingham Palace, and cartoonist 
Conrad manages to turn even that into an insult ("Now, is this in lieu of my 
usual $50,000 speaking fee?" June 19). 
</P>
<P>
Is there no end to Conrad's vilification of Reagan? That's a rhetorical

THEY REALLY DESERVE A RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than five months after the House wilted under the heat of an organized 
pressure campaign and voted down higher pay for members of Congress and other 
federal officials, Speaker Thomas S. Foley is again saying that judicial and 
executive branch pay should be raised, preferably by action this year. He's 
right, and it would be just as right to extend the prospect of higher pay to 
Congress as well, however politically unpalatable that idea might seem right 
now. The fact is that pay scales in all branches of government have fallen far 
behind what they ought to be. Worse, in the case of Congress, the present pay 
ceiling continues to provide an excuse for accepting outside fees, thus 
inescapably corrupting the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people, to be sure, remain distinctly unimpressed by calls for higher 
federal pay. It's not hard to see why. At $89,500 a year, a member of Congress, 
a federal district judge, a civilian secretary of one of the armed services or 
a deputy secretary in the Department of State, Defense or Treasury already 
earns far more than the great majority of people. Indeed, these salaries, like 
the $99,500 Cabinet officers are paid annually, puttheir recipients among the 
4% or 5% best-paid Americans. People who have to get by on a lot less have 
every reason to wonder why certain well-paid public servants should be paid 
even more. 
</P>
<P>
The best answer, at least for the judicial and executive branches, has to do 
with equity and pay competitiveness. Americans want high-quality public 
servants; that, we think, can be taken as a given. But quality is a marketable 
value. 
</P>
<P>
There are, happily for the nation, a lot of talented and selfless people in the 
federalgovernment who are willing to work for less than they could earn 
elsewhere because they aregenuinely committed to public service. It's one 
thing, though, to be prepared to work for less; it's something else to be asked 
to accept a rate of pay that is effectively punitive. 
</P>
<P>
A good lawyer invited to the federal bench is usually asked to give up an 
annual income three or more times greater than what he will earn as a judge. 
And a Cabinet officer or senior executive-branch official almost certainly 
could expect to earn four, six or even 10 times as much in the private sector. 
No one has ever suggested that government should pay such people what the 
private sector offers. But certainly, if talented people are to be drawn to and 
remain in federal service, they deserve to be paid 40% or 50% more than what 
they are offered now. 
</P>
<P>
And Congress? The Senate and House are institutions where the idea that you get 
what you pay for almost certainly doesn't apply, because as an institution 
Congress really doesn't compete with the private sector. The real issue with 
Congress is that its members should be paid more primarily so they will no 
longer have an excuse for accepting money from special pleaders in the form of 
"honoraria," speaking fees or phony book "royalties." What's needed, in short, 
is a congressional pay increase of, say, 40%, which is comparable to the 
Senate's present limit on outside income, welded to a ban on accepting any fees 
or rewards for outside appearances, talks, publications or whatever. That 
provision ought to seriously weaken, even if it doesn't wholly eliminate, the 
temptation to sell votes and influence for cash and other favors. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Congress should be held to a strict standard of legislative honesty even 
without the incentive of higher pay. The unpleasant fact is that we're not 
likely to achieve the first without providing the second. In any event, 
Congress will probably be asked to reconsider the question of higher federal 
pay before the year is out. This time it ought to do the right thing and vote 
senior federal officials, members of Congress included, the pay boosts that are 
so long overdue.

STATE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, Pat Nolan reveals his lack of concern for the welfare of the 
various citizens in this state, in favor of his own constituents, by whom he 
expects with statements like this, to be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks we should believe that students in depressed areas like Watts need 
only what those of poor families in Glendale need. He proposes to resolve this 
"disparity" by increasing funds to all students but more so, relatively to 
those within districts like his own. Yet he ignores the real reasons for the 
disparity, such as population density, crime rates and stress, and lack of 
employment opportunities in the inner-city depressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
I say thank goodness for the "political muscle" that provides for those with 
clearly greater needs. Nolan and Gov. Deukmejian should stop their 
Democrat-bashing and start releasing funds from the state lottery and the new 
cigarette tax, or they will soon both be out of public life.

ART DONATIONS AND THE TAX CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your impassioned appeal (editorial, June 4) to "bring back the tax break for 
art," while well-intentioned, is both naive and misleading. In effect what you 
are suggesting is that the tax rate should go back up to 50% or more so that 
the public can have the benefit of admiring works of art in museums. Do you 
really think this will fly with Congress? Or are you advocating a revolt of the 
rich? 
</P>
<P>
The editorial is misleading because of the statement that the 1986 tax code 
"effectively abolished that subsidy by eliminating taxpayers' ability to deduct 
the full appreciated value of their gifts to art museums." It did nothing of 
the sort for the ordinary taxpayers, who can still make their deduction based 
on the full appreciated value of their gift at the time they make the gift. 
</P>
<P>
It is only when a taxpayer has reduced his tax liability to zero as a result of 
other deductions that the principle of "alternate minimum tax" applies, and the 
taxpayer can then deduct only what he originally paid for the work of art. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, this is a very complicated issue that is not well understood even 
by accountants or lawyers. Your naivete therefore is understandable but rather 
irresponsible.

Once again our former President has demonstrated his abysmal ignorance of an 
indifference to American history and people (not to mention his own Irish 
heritage) by his unseemly acceptance of a knighthood from British royalty. As 
if tributes to fallen Nazi SS soldiers were not enough, now we witness sworn 
fealty to the very sovereigns against whom our forefathers and foremothers 
sacrificed their lives to win our independence. 
</P>
<P>
Am I the only person who feels that Ronald Reagan's latest foray into 
self-aggrandizement is a slap in the face to all the American patriots who

COASTAL PARK FATE DEPENDS ON CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The area known as Shoreline Park, owned by the county of Los Angeles and 
adjacent to San Pedro, has recently been put up for sale as "surplus property." 
Governmental bodies have the right to bid on the property before it is offered 
to developers. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to suggest that the four cities of the Palos Verdes Peninsula get 
together and buy this beautiful piece of shoreline. This would ensure that some 
small part of the coastline is left as open space for our children and 
grandchildren.

The park could be held by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy or by a 
four-city park district. Because of the scarcity and high price of coastal 
land, this opportunity is unique and should be acted upon quickly. If citizens 
feel this is a good suggestion, please call your local city hall.

PADRES' PITCHING HITS THE SPOT AS DODGERS WIN, 6-2

<P>
The Dodgers may be the worst hitting team in baseball, but they found a soft 
touch Wednesday night against the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a pitching staff that has given up more home runs than any in the 
National League, the Dodgers hit three into the bleachers at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium to power their way to a 6-2 victory in front of 29,336. 
</P>
<P>
All three homers came off starter Ed Whitson and all came with two out. 
</P>
<P>
The damage was early and complete. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Davis and Jeff Hamilton hit two-run homers in the first inning and Eddie 
Murray added a bases-empty homer in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' homer was his second in three games against the Padres, and Murray's was 
his first since he hit two in a game in Philadelphia on May 14. 
</P>
<P>
Murray had gone 35 games and 127 at-bats without a homer and had only two hits 
in his previous 28 at-bats. The homer came after Murray walked in his first two 
plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got beat by the long ball," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "We didn't 
have our outfielders up high enough." 
</P>
<P>
The victory prevented the Padres from sweeping the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitcher Tim Leary (6-5) came within three outs of his first complete 
game since April 16, but he yielded to Jay Howell after giving up a lead-off 
single to shortstop Garry Templeton in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Howell retired the first two Padres in order before a fielding error by 
Hamilton on pinch-hitter Carmelo Martinez's grounder to third extended the 
inning. Howell struck out Shawn Abner to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a toss-up whether to take me out," Leary said. "But Jay was warmed up, 
and they had a right-hander coming up. It was a good move." 
</P>
<P>
In earning his third victory in four starts, Leary gave up 10 hits and two 
runs, only one of which was earned. That came on catcher Mark Parent's 
bases-empty homer in the seventh. The Padres' other run was unearned and came 
after a passed ball in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Leary disposed of most of the other Padre threats easily. He struck out Abner 
to end the second with runners on second and third. And twice he got Tony 
Gwynn, who entered the game as the league's leading hitter, to ground into 
double plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Those double plays were the key," Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was Whitson's third in a row after a career-best, seven-game winning 
streak and dropped his record to 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he was winning, home runs had plagued Whitson. 
</P>
<P>
He had given up 13 in his previous 14 starts. The three by the Dodgers raised 
his total of 16, high on a pitching staff that has allowed a National 
League-leading 68 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the home runs are concerned, it was just bad pitch selection, bad 
location, too," Whitson said. "Three pitches took me out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive start home runs had cost Whitson a game. In his 
previous start, Whitson gave up all the runs on two homers in a 3-1 loss to 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
And just as in that loss, the clincher was a two-run homer in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson retired the first two batters, but then walked Murray. Davis followed 
with his fourth homer, a drive that carried three rows into the right-field 
bleachers for a 2-0 lead. The homer was Davis' second of the series and the 
ninth the Padres have allowed to a player named Davis. Eric Davis of Cincinnati 
has hit five against the Padres and Glenn Davis of Houston has hit two. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia then singled to center before Hamilton took Whitson's 1-0 pitch 
into the first row of bleachers in left-center field for a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres cut the lead to 4-1 with an unearned run in the bottom of the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn doubled home second baseman Roberto Alomar, who had singled and advanced 
to second on a passed ball with one out. Leary avoided further trouble by 
striking out Jack Clark and getting Marvell Wynne to ground out to the mound to 
end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Murray hit his homer in the fifth to put the Dodgers ahead, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers made the score 6-1 on an RBI double by Willie Randolph in the 
seventh against reliever Pat Clements. 
</P>
<P>
Parent's homer above the 370-foot mark in right-center field in the bottom of 
the seventh closed the scoring. Parent was making a last-minute start in place 
of Benito Santiago, who had been given permission by McKeon to miss the game to 
be with his wife, Blanca, who was hospitalized to give birth to the couple's 
second child. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
News of the New York Yankees' trade of Rickey Henderson to the Oakland 
Athletics on Wednesday caught Fred Claire, Dodger vice president for player 
personnel, by surprise. Claire said he learned of the trade from reporters 
shortly before the Dodgers' game against the Padres. Claire said he had talked 
to Syd Thrift, Yankee general manager, about Henderson's availability as part 
of an ongoing effort to acquire an established lead-off hitter. "We'd like to 
get some help at the top of our order," Claire said. "I am searching and hoping 
to find an answer that will help our offense." Henderson was traded for 
outfielder Luis Polonia and pitchers Greg Cadaret and Eric Plunk. "Syd was 
looking for pitching," Claire said. "That was clearly a need of the Yankees." 
It also is a commodity the Dodgers have in good supply. Claire said he will 
continue his search for more hitting. "My desire to improve our offense gets 
greater as our offensive struggles increase," Claire said. The Dodgers entered 
Wednesday night's game with a .227 batting average, worst in the major leagues. 
But more puzzling, Claire said, was that despite their low average, the Dodgers 
are second only to the Padres in runners left on base with 506. The problem has 
been that Dodgers are hitting .202 with runners in scoring position. "We're 
just not getting the timely hits," Claire said. "There is a lot of pride in 
defending a world championship, and at times you just try too hard." . . . The 
Dodgers are off today before starting a four-game series in Cincinnati Friday.

LYN ST. JAMES HAS HER SIGHTS SET ON CHANCE TO RACE AT INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shav Glick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyn St. James has driven at 212.577 m.p.h. on the high banks at Talladega, has 
won in her class in the 24 Hours of Daytona, driving with Bill Elliott and Tom 
Gloy, was the first woman to win a professional road race driving solo and 
recently fulfilled a lifetime goal of racing in the 24 Hours of LeMans. 
</P>
<P>
Now she wants the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I don't have much open-wheel experience to draw from, but I had a good 
Trans-Am season last year and I know what it's like to go over 200 so I feel 
I'm ready to get some time in an Indy car," she said after returning from 
France. 
</P>
<P>
"LeMans was everything I had hoped for and more. I think the experience I had 
this year will help out a lot. Now I want to go back next year and finish. 
</P>
<P>
"The track is very long (8.4 miles) and difficult to learn, but going 220 on 
the straightway was almost relaxing because there wasn't heavy traffic. The 
record runs helped, too, because those speeds weren't new to me." 
</P>
<P>
St. James drove a DurAlt FC/Spice-Cosworth with Ray Bell and car owner-designer 
Gordon Spice. The car, which St. James drove for a little more than five hours, 
dropped out after 16 hours with engine problems. 
</P>
<P>
She was in a 1989 Ford Thunderbird Super Coupe when she broke her own woman's 
national closed-course record of 212.577 m.p.h. last October at Talladega, Ala. 
That broke the 204.223 record she had set in 1985 in a Ford Probe GTP. 
</P>
<P>
"They got me at 232 going down the straightaway," she said. "I don't think they 
go much faster than that at Indy, if they go that fast." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a racing career that began in 1975 when she drove her husband's Pinto 
into a lake during her first race at Palm Beach, Fla., (they are no longer 
married), Lyn had never driven an Indy car until Dick Simon gave her a chance 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to find out if I would be intimidated, or overwhelmed, but it really 
did feel good," she said. "I felt more comfortable after a few laps than I did 
after two days in the T-Bird at Talladega." 
</P>
<P>
St. James got her chance when Simon was testing his Lola-Cosworth at Memphis 
the day after the Miami Grand Prix, final Indy car race of 1988. Didier Theys 
had finished third in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"Lyn did a super job," Simon said. "Much better than Janet (Guthrie) did in her 
first ride. I was very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Simon was Guthrie's coach when she became the first woman driver in the 
Indianapolis 500 in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"Lyn took her time, gradually worked her way up to speed and was very 
respectful of the equipment," Simon said. "She drove a couple of hundred miles 
and before she was through she was very quick." 
</P>
<P>
St. James' long-range plans to get to Indy include 2,000 miles of testing 
before she tries to qualify. Toward that end, she is cutting back on her duties 
as spokeswoman and consumer adviser for Ford Motor Co., a position she has had 
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the road 260 days last year," she said. "I almost forgot what my home 
in Ft. Lauderdale (Fla.) looked like. I had to convince Ford how serious I was 
about my racing career, that I needed more time to race." 
</P>
<P>
This season, St. James is running the full 15-race Trans-Am schedule in a new 
Mustang. She finished fourth in the season opener at Long Beach and was fifth 
at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she was involved in one of the most frightening accidents ever seen at 
Riverside International Raceway during the Times/Ford Grand Prix of Endurance. 
</P>
<P>
After being clipped in the rear by a Corvette driven by Doc Bundy, St. James' 
GT Probe spun into the wall in the first turn at more than 140 m.p.h. and burst 
into flames. She crawled out with no more than a sore back and temporary loss 
of the use of her left arm, which she regained through intense therapy. 
</P>
<P>
The following February she came back to win her fourth IMSA GTO race at Daytona 
with Elliott and Gloy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to help Ford win the manufacturer's championship this season, but 
in the back of my mind I'm thinking about Indy," she said. "I guess I've really 
thought about it since the first time I saw the race when I was 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived in Willoughby, Ohio, at the time and went to Indy with a bunch of 
friends. Women weren't even allowed in Gasoline Alley then and when I saw A. J. 
Foyt I handed him a piece of paper through the fence for his autograph." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, St. James was A. J.'s co-driver at the Daytona 24 hour race 
in a Aston Martin Nimrod. 
</P>
<P>
"I reminded him of that when we raced together and he just laughed, but I 
couldn't help but think how far I'd come, and how far women had come in 
racing." 
</P>
<P>
If all goes according to plan, she will be racing against A. J. in 1990 or 1991 
at the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
SPEEDWAY CYCLES -- The suspension of Shawn Moran from all world championship 
events for racing while under the influence of alcohol last month in Denmark 
has been upheld by the American Motorcyclist Assn. It will prevent Moran, 1983 
world long-track champion from Apple Valley, from riding in the Overseas Final 
of the world individual runoffs Saturday night in Belle Vue, England, which is 
Moran's home track in the British Speedway League. 
</P>
<P>
Moran had appealed the ruling, claiming the penalty was too severe for the 
offense, but it was rejected by the AMA. Rick Miller, another British League 
rider from Reseda, will replace Moran in the Overseas Final, joining Sam 
Ermolenko of Cypress, Ronnie Correy of Fullerton and Lance King of Fountain 
Valley as the United States' representatives in the world meet. The World Final 
will be Sept. 2 in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Speedway racing is enjoying a booming back this year from a lapse in interest. 
Last Friday night's attendance of 9,200 at the Orange County Fairgrounds was 
the first sellout at the Costa Mesa track since 1981, when Bruce Penhall of 
Balboa returned home to ride after winning his first world championship. . . . 
Racing will continue tonight at Ascot Park, Friday night at Costa Mesa, 
Saturday night at Victorville's Speedway USA and Wednesday night at Glen Helen 
Park in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
OFF ROAD -- The SCORE closed course world championships, which have been held 
at Riverside for the past 16 years, will be held this year at Phoenix 
International Raceway. The Sept. 9-10 event will be contested completely inside 
the track. . . . Danny Cau, former operations director for the High Desert 
Racing Assn., has bought the HDRA from Edna Lott, widow of its late founder, 
Walt Lott, and Riverside businessman Tom Spiel. Cau will replace Mrs. Lott, who 
is retiring, as president. He said he plans no operational changes in the Las 
Vegas-based desert racing organization. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th annual SCORE Off-Road Equipment Show, which will run this weekend at 
Anaheim Convention Center, will feature appearances by racing champions Ivan 
Stewart, Dave Shoppe and Rod Hall. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- The fifth round of the Toyota Super Production series for 
unlimited international stock cars is scheduled for this weekend at Willow 
Springs Raceway with Ed Ash looking for a second consecutive victory in his red 
Corvette. Also on the Saturday-Sunday program will be Cal Club-sponsored Sports 
Car Club of America regional championship races. 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR's Southwest Tour, with Dan Press holding a 195-point edge over Mike 
Chase after winning his fourth race last Saturday night at Saugus, moves to 
Madera Speedway Saturday night for the Budweiser 100. 
</P>
<P>
Winston Racing Series programs will run Sunday night at Ascot Park and Saturday 
night at Orange Show Speedway and Cajon Speedway. Street stocks run Friday 
night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- The Parnelli Jones Firestone series returns to Ascot Park for a 
30-lap California Racing Assn. main event Saturday night with Jerry Meyer 
holding a 169-point lead over former CRA champion Brad Noffsinger, who won his 
fifth main event last Saturday night at Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Lealand McSpadden, who was making his first start last week after having broken 
his right shoulder in an accident April 8 at Ascot, had his left shoulder 
bruised in a first-turn skirmish with pole-sitter Clark Drake. McSpadden hopes 
to return for the July 1 50-lap race at Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- The United States Auto Club's Jolly Rancher western regional series 
for full and three-quarter midgets moves to Saugus Speedway for races on the 
paved one-third mile flat oval Saturday night. Also on the show will be street 
stocks and a destruction derby. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- Ron Lechien of El Cajon won both motos riding a Kawasaki in the 
United States 500cc Grand Prix last Sunday at Hollister Hills, frustrating 
European riders once again. World champion Eric Geboers of Belgium finished 
second, ahead of Jeff Leisk of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Multi-champion Rick Johnson hopes to test his broken wrist this weekend in an 
invitational at Mammoth Mountain, where he is entered in the 125, 250 and 500cc 
events. The Honda rider has been out since March 5 when he crashed during 
practice at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
GREAT AMERICAN RACE -- More than 100 vintage racing machines -- from a 1902 
Mors Grand Prix racer from France to a 1940 Jaguar SS-100 -- will take off 
Monday in the seventh annual Interstate Great American Race which will end July 
7 at Disneyland in Anaheim. Wayne Stanfield of Tustin, the 1987 winner in a 
1916 Mitchell, is one of the favorites to win the $50,000 first prize for the 
team that runs closest to its prescribed schedule on the final two days from 
Phoenix to San Diego to Disneyland. Also entered is Jim Stocker of San 
Bernardino, winner of the pre-1916 class last year in a 1914 Ford Runabout. 
</P>
<P>
LAND SPEED -- At least seven members of the newly organized 300 m.p.h. chapter 
of the 200 MPH Club are expected to be on hand for the first meeting Sunday at 
Anacapa View in Simi Valley. Expected are Don Carr, Bob McGrath, Bob Noice, Bob 
Summers, Elwin Teague, Don Vesco and Nolan White. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS CARS -- Rocky Moran of Arcadia was selected by team manager Dan Gurney 
to replace Chris Cord, who has retired because of poor health, on the Toyota 
GTP team in the International Motor Sports Assn. series.

COUGAR II PROVIDED THRILLS -- AND A LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after Joe Hernandez sold Cougar II to Mary Jones Bradley, he stopped by 
the barn of the new owner's trainer, Charlie Whittingham. Hernandez wanted a 
set of Cougar's shoes for souvenirs and he also wanted to cadge a bucket of 
carrots. 
</P>
<P>
"Get your own carrots," Whittingham told him. "We just gave you $125,000, what 
more do you want?" 
</P>
<P>
This was in 1970, three years before the Chilean-bred was retired with $1.1 
million in earnings, the first foreign horse to have earned $1 million in 
purses here. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Cougar was voted America's best grass horse in 1972 and near the 
end of his career, on the third try, he won the Santa Anita Handicap, one of 
the country's premier dirt races. 
</P>
<P>
At stud, Cougar sired offspring that earned more than $11 million, the most 
famous being Gato Del Sol, winner of the Kentucky Derby in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
At 23, Cougar's career as a stallion ended suddenly June 11. After having been 
bred to a mare, he suffered a ruptured stomach and died before surgery started. 
</P>
<P>
On the track, Cougar was an unusual horse in many respects. No pony was needed 
to bring him to the post, and he would seem to acknowledge the cheers of the 
fans, bowing toward the crowd and then gazing at the tote board. Once he got 
rolling, Cougar had a paddling motion not unlike that of a Mississippi River 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sort of a ham," Bradley said. "A real crowd pleaser." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham picked him out, but after Bradley committed herself to buying 
Cougar, the owner and the trainer debated about who would control the horse. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie finally said that he would take half of him if he went on to win 
$250,000," Bradley said. "But I said to Charlie, 'Well, then, that would make 
him worth more than $125,000, wouldn't it?' so there was no deal." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham thus earned 10% of Cougar's purses instead of the much higher share 
due a co-owner. He still enjoys telling the story as an example of how he won't 
allow an owner to dominate him. 
</P>
<P>
"But it still was a pretty expensive mad, wasn't it?" is the way Whittingham 
finishes the story. 
</P>
<P>
Cougar raced in the East as well as in California but he never had much luck on 
the road. Rain made the courses soft, which Cougar disliked. But on the dirt in 
the 1971 Woodward at Belmont Park, he finished first by five lengths. However, 
he was moved back to third by the stewards for causing interference in the 
stretch. Bradley believes that that disqualification prevented Cougar from 
being voted horse of the year. Ack Ack, another horse trained by Whittingham, 
won the title. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who announced the races at Santa Anita for 38 years, missed the 
rousing finish to Cougar's career. He died in February of 1972 at 62. 
</P>
<P>
Sabona will try to become the first 7-year-old since Native Diver to win the 
Hollywood Gold Cup when the stake is run for the 50th time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Native Diver won his first Gold Cup when he was a 6-year-old in 1965, his first 
of three straight victories in the stake. 
</P>
<P>
Sabona was a winner at 15-1 in the Californian when Ruhlmann, the odds-on 
favorite, ran fifth, even though slow early fractions appeared to be in 
Ruhlmann's favor. Ruhlmann is not going to run in the $500,000 Gold Cup, at 1 
1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Nasr El Arab is the high weight at 123 pounds. Also expected to run are 
Blushing John, 122 pounds; Lively One, 116; Payant, 115; Henbane, 112, and 
Paramount Jet, 109. Sabona will carry 116 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Floyd (D-Carson), the assemblyman trying to get a revised state medication 
bill passed, says that trainer Roger Stein has a good chance to win his 
$25-million lawsuit against the California Horse Racing Board. 
</P>
<P>
Stein was the first of several trainers to run a horse that tested positive for 
cocaine. He received a suspension, while charges were dropped against the 
others for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It might turn out better for Stein than if he won all the stakes they run for 
the next five years," Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Issel, former basketball star at the University of Kentucky and with the 
Denver Nuggets, formed a syndicate in 1981 that was going to breed horses to be 
sold as yearlings. A few years later, however, the horse market bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the syndicate is on the verge of going out of business. Shares that were 
worth about $2 apiece in the beginning were worth only six cents at one point 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious' victory in last Saturday's Ohio Derby was scored against the 
second-stringers and worse of the 3-year-old division, but at least the colt 
proved that he could handle two turns while making his first appearance outside 
California. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, who now has a lifetime record of seven wins in eight starts, 
could be a factor against the stars of the division. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Trotter, racing secretary at Arlington International Racecourse and 
Gulfstream Park, said that if he had to handicap Triple Crown adversaries 
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, he would put them at 128 pounds apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"That's strictly based on their comparative records," Trotter said. "But right 
now, after he won the Belmont as easily as he did, I would have to say that 
Easy Goer is the better horse." 
</P>
<P>
While covering the Triple Crown races for ABC television, Jim McKay told a 
story about himself as a cub reporter for the Baltimore Sun. 
</P>
<P>
His first week on the job, McKay didn't have a desk, so an editor told him: 
"Dempsey's on vacation, so you can have that desk this week." 
</P>
<P>
When the week ended, McKay still hadn't been assigned a desk and he didn't want 
to be caught at Dempsey's desk the following Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody with a name like Dempsey, I didn't want to cross him," McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, McKay met Dempsey -- Margaret Dempsey. She wasn't upset that another 
reporter had been using her desk, and now she's married to McKay. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness and second in 
the Belmont Stakes, might run in the Swaps at Hollywood Park on July 23. If the 
winner of a Triple Crown stake runs in the race, the purse increases from 
$200,000 to $400,000. . . . Fast Play, one of last year's best 2-year-olds 
before he chipped a knee, won by 4 1/4 lengths at Belmont Park last Sunday in 
his 3-year-old debut. Fast Play, a son of Seattle Slew, is merely another top 
3-year-old for trainer Shug McGaughey, who already has Easy Goer and Awe 
Inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
That $1-million bonus won by Sunday Silence in the Triple Crown races also 
benefited trainer Charlie Whittingham and jockey Pat Valenzuela and moved both 
into first place on the national money list. Whittingham moved ahead of Wayne 
Lukas by a few dollars, one of the few times in the last six years that Lukas 
hasn't been first this late in the season. . . . Jockey Patti Barton, severely 
injured when she was trampled by a horse at Fairmount Park several years ago, 
has reportedly received an out-of-court settlement of $400,000 plus $2,000 a 
month for life. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Gene Klein, talking about his sensational 3-year-old filly, Open Mind: "I 
think she'd have had an even-up shot in the Kentucky Derby, especially the way 
the race was run. But look at the size of her -- she's so little. And if she 
had won the Derby, then the temptation would have been to put her in the 
Preakness, and that wouldn't have been fair to do that to such a little filly." 
. . . Angel Cordero is now one for 19 in the Belmont Stakes.

CULVER CITY ASSISTANT TO REPLACE MCCURDY AS ROYAL BASEBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel May, a varsity assistant at Culver City High for the past three years, 
has been selected to guide the Royal baseball program, Principal Dave Jackson 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
May, 26, replaces Mike McCurdy, who resigned last month with a four-year record 
of 44-56. The Highlanders were 12-17 and finished sixth in the Marmonte League 
with a 4-8 mark in 1989. Royal never reached the playoffs under McCurdy. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson picked May over Al Tarazon, the other finalist for the job and the 
junior varsity coach at Channel Islands High. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision because both are fine young men," Jackson said. "I sat 
down and took a big yellow paper and listed the pros and cons of each. The easy 
part is when you have one guy who's a 10 and everyone else is a 4. Both these 
guys were 9-plus. 
</P>
<P>
"The part that swayed me was that Dan May had three years of varsity experience 
as an assistant. But I'll tell you what, Al Tarazon will be a head coach 
somewhere soon." 
</P>
<P>
May will join Royal in the fall as a student teacher in the art and photography 
departments. He also will assist in the football program. 
</P>
<P>
"That did not come into my final decision. I was trying to find a very, very 
good baseball coach," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
May has coached the Culver City defensive line for the past two seasons. He 
coached the freshman baseball team before serving as varsity assistant the past 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
May said that he met Royal Athletic Director Terry Dobbins three years ago at a 
Culver City-Simi Valley baseball playoff game and has kept in touch ever since. 
Dobbins, then at Simi Valley, later moved to Royal. May's parents also live in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Between keeping in touch with Dobbins and my parents, I stayed on top of what 
was going on with job openings out there," said May, a 1981 Culver City 
graduate who played baseball at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
May said that he is exploring the possibility of entering Royal in an area 
summer league. 
</P>
<P>
"We're off to a late start," May said. "But I'm hoping that with the contacts I 
have down here that we can work something out. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it's real informal, I'd like to see what we're going to have out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Culver City won the Ocean League title last season and finished 21-7. The 
Centaurs were defeated by Long Beach Millikan in the second round of the 
Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs.

NEW CAL LUTHERAN COACH PUTTING IN LOTS OF RECRUITMENT OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Dunlap's ears are red and burning. Not that he hasn't been a hot topic of 
conversation around Thousand Oaks, but he's been putting in substantial time at 
the receiving end of a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
For the better part of three weeks Dunlap says he has dialed "just about 
everyone I know" to leave the following messages: 
</P>
<P>
1) I'm the new basketball coach at Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
2) Helllp!!! 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap's problem is rather basic -- a shortage of players. Cal Lutheran's 
roster is only seven deep, a predicament its new coach is literally searching 
the ends of the Earth to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Among the players Dunlap is recruiting is a 6-foot-5 forward from Australia. 
Another possibility lives in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm not on the phone, then it's usually ringing," said Dunlap, who was 
hired May 26. "Right now, a telephone is the most valuable tool I have." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year old former assistant at Loyola Marymount, Iowa and USC, who has 
never been a head coach, has taken the reins of a program in transition from 
the NAIA to NCAA Division III, a program embroiled in a measure of turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap replaced Larry Lopez, who guided the Kingsmen to a 37-49 record over 
three seasons on a part-time basis while teaching science full-time at Frontier 
High, a continuation school in Camarillo. Although his record was under .500, 
Lopez succeeded in making his team competitive. Cal Lutheran had won only five 
of 28 games in 1986, the season before Lopez took over. 
</P>
<P>
When CLU committed a full-time staff position to its basketball program and 
advertised it nationally, Lopez was forced to apply for his own job. 
</P>
<P>
The popular Lopez was a finalist among some 90 applicants, but that distinction 
didn't soothe the ire of Kingsmen players, a few of whom cried foul when their 
coach was passed over. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap read the reaction in local newspapers and was reminded of a similar 
situation when he was a first-year assistant at USC. Three top players left 
that Trojan team after George Raveling replaced Stan Morrison as coach. 
</P>
<P>
It was time for a few more phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"They were upset, but with young individuals you find that's usually pretty 
temporary," Dunlap said. "They have to realize that I can't control the fact 
that a change was made. I can only control what's ahead of us now. I think they 
will accept me at face value, which is all I ask." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Dunlap enlisted the aid of Jeff deLaveaga, the only player he knew 
on the Cal Lutheran team he inherited. Dunlap, who had worked with deLaveaga at 
USC's basketball camp, asked him to help ease any uncertainty the returning 
players might have about the plans of their new coach. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga, whose older brother Steve finished his senior campaign last season 
as the school's all-time leading scorer, said the reaction was mostly positive. 
</P>
<P>
"Some players weren't on the best of terms with Coach Lopez and were glad to 
see the change," deLaveaga said. "Others loved him and were hesitant about the 
change. Personally, I have a good, positive, image of Coach Dunlap from the 
camp. He's a real fire plug. He goes full speed with everything he does. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed real positive with the kids at the camp. He'd yell and get in your 
shorts if you didn't hustle. I remember every kid would sprint to his group 
because they knew if they didn't run then, they'd be running even more later." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Steve deLaveaga was among the most outspoken critics of Dunlap's 
selection over Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, when I first called Jeff it was Steve who answered the phone," 
Dunlap said. "I told him I understood why he was upset. I told him that I would 
want my players to feel the same way about me if the situation was different. I 
think he was happy to hear that." 
</P>
<P>
That settled, it was back to recruiting, a task Dunlap became familiar with in 
his four years -- one at Iowa and three at USC -- as an assistant under 
Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an affection for this level because there's a lot of coaching 
involved," Dunlap said. "But don't get me wrong -- you still need players. 
Coach Raveling says he's seen a lot of very good coaches who got fired because 
they didn't pay enough attention to whom they were recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap doesn't plan to be one of them. He considers the Cal Lutheran job an 
"appropriate maturation" after nine seasons as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to be a head coach and, as a friend of mine told me, 'If 
you're a head coach, you're a head coach no matter what level you're at," 
Dunlap said. "It's a little like going to graduate school. You learn your trade 
and at some point in time you jump out of the nest and try it on your own." 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap reports that he has found three players "very interested" in coming to 
Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come in real late on some kids, but I think we've at least muddied the 
waters on a few of them that were about to make a decision to go somewhere 
else," Dunlap said. "This would have been considerably easier if I had this job 
in April."

U. S. OPEN CUT LEAVES NO SCARS; 
</P>
<P>
JON FIEDLER FAILED TO QUALIFY FOR EVENT'S FINAL ROUNDS BUT MEMORIES ARE ALL 
FOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Please excuse Jon Fiedler for a while if his mind seems to wander as he stands 
at the Las Posas Country Club practice range, giving lessons to one of those 
guys who swings a golf club like he's harvesting wheat. 
</P>
<P>
When Fiedler, the assistant pro at Las Posas, swings a club these days -- or 
shows someone else how to -- he does not gaze down onto the field and see a 
practice range. He sees Oak Hill Country Club. He does not see an insurance 
salesman named Ed standing beside him, he sees Lee Trevino. Or Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Fiedler sees and feels the United States Open, one of the most prestigious golf 
tournaments in the world. He played in it last week, and he hasn't quite gotten 
around to hanging up the jacket of joy that he wore for a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I might be like this for about six months," Fiedler said Wednesday, his second 
day back at the Camarillo course. "I'll think about what I did, and what I 
might have done. I'll remember situations, certain holes, certain shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Back at the range here at Las Posas, I look out and imagine it all, all the 
situations I was in back at the Open. I'm thinking about every bad shot I hit, 
and a lot of the very good ones that I hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'll always think about it." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the performance in Rochester, N.Y., was not the best example of 
high-caliber golf that the former USC star has displayed. He began with a round 
of 77 and, after a double bogey on the first hole the next day, he carded a 
second-round 83 and missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the memories are good ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a practice round with Trevino and Watson three days before the 
tournament, and what a thrill it was," he said. "The crowd was fantastic. It 
was like playing in a final-round pairing. It was the biggest crowd I had ever 
had following me. Of course, maybe some of those people were following Trevino 
or Watson." 
</P>
<P>
Fiedler laughed when he said that. But despite being disappointed with his 
scores, he wants it known that there is nothing funny about qualifying for, 
then playing in, the U. S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the feeling was great," he said. "Going in I expected fully to make 
the cut and play some good golf. I'm a good golfer. I don't shoot 83s. It 
wasn't luck that I got into the U. S. Open. I had to beat a lot of very good 
golfers in qualifying to make it. 
</P>
<P>
"But all in all, the memories are good ones. After the second round a little 
kid came up to me and asked for my autograph. I told him I had just shot an 83 
and he said, 'I don't care. You're a pro golfer.' It made me feel pretty good. 
But I felt like signing Ben Crenshaw's name or Hal Sutton's name or any other 
blond golfer like me who was doing well." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Fiedler said, came off the tee. He is a power golfer who can hit 
the ball out of sight. But on the tight, narrow fairways and scrubby rough of 
Oak Hill, hitting the fairways was a necessity. Fiedler didn't visit too many 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could change anything about that week, I would have gotten there sooner 
and done a better job of figuring out the course," he said. "I would have 
adjusted off the tee just a bit, maybe sacrificing some distance for a little 
more accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had had more time for preparation, I think I could have cut back on my 
swing and kept the ball in the fairway more. That made all the difference. I 
putted really well and still shot those high scores, so you can see just how 
bad I was hitting it off the tee." 
</P>
<P>
Fiedler, an Air Force brat, learned the game in Japan at age 13. His father, a 
colonel who is now retired, and his father's friends -- and even complete 
strangers -- worked with Fiedler until he began to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, who live in Oxnard, made the trip to Rochester last week to watch 
their son. That, Fiedler said, was perhaps the highlight of it all. 
</P>
<P>
"Having them there to watch me was really great," he said. "I talked with them 
as I played and just couldn't help looking at them during the rounds. My dad 
was proud of me, and you could see that. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to have them back there to see it. I felt like I was giving 
something back to them after all the time they gave to me."

EX-DOMINGUEZ HILLS ATHLETIC DIRECTOR STILL REMEMBERS 'DOWN THERE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a year later, Sue Carberry still finds it difficult to forget. 
</P>
<P>
The former Cal State Dominguez Hills athletic director, who quit abruptly to 
teach in a small Mendocino County town, still refers to her former employers as 
"we" and, when she hears about the issues that affect the Carson campus 700 
miles to the south, catches herself reflecting on them. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny Laytonville, a town three hours north of San Francisco on U.S. 101, 
couldn't be much farther removed from the hustle and bustle of the big time -- 
what Carberry terms "down there" in the urban trenches. The nearest population 
center in those parts, Willits, has just 4,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
There's an easiness in her new way of life that Carberry finds refreshing. A 
year ago she dealt with athletic eligibility and financial restraint. Today she 
raises rabbits on a 40-acre plot and watches her garden grow. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking urban habits, however, is a slow process. 
</P>
<P>
"I still read the sports pages first," she said by telephone. "That is, when I 
can get a newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Originally from Illinois, Carberry came to Dominguez Hills from an 
administrative job at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
She coached softball for a while, then assumed the athletic directorship six 
years ago, at a crucial time in the school's history, combining both the men's 
and women's programs under a single administrator. She is credited with laying 
the groundwork at a small-thinking, former NAIA program that, with a credible 
fund-raising effort, has the ability to obtain star status on the competitive 
NCAA Division II level. 
</P>
<P>
She gained the respect of many of the athletic directors in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. for her ability to recognize problem areas and deal 
with them before they got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Early in her five-year term, Dominguez Hills dropped men's and women's 
cross-country, track and tennis because of financial constraints, but Carberry 
had the moxie to add women's soccer. Within three years the program was ranked 
third in the nation among both Division I and II schools. 
</P>
<P>
The move to soccer showed her foresight, according to current Athletic Director 
Dan Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
"Sue was the roll-up-your-sleeves kind of person which you have to be at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carberry often handled some of the minute problems of her job by making do. 
When the athletic department was consolidated under one roof in a tiny building 
intended to be a locker room, her staff members quickly ran out of space. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, she told them. Carberry converted the lone shower to a filing 
cabinet and the adjacent toilet to a book stand. To this day, those quarters 
are still a storage facility for the athletic administration. 
</P>
<P>
Early in her tenure, Carberry hired Guerrero as her assistant. He credits her 
with helping him grow into an eventual candidate for her job by letting him 
take important roles on committees affecting athletics. 
</P>
<P>
But as time went on, Carberry discovered something was missing in her life. 
</P>
<P>
"You see people like me in all kinds of work," she said. "Lots of them plod 
through their jobs, unhappy. Something is missing. Perhaps they aren't even 
doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, Carberry had burned out. She says she's not sure of the main cause. 
She prefers to say it was a combination of smog, traffic and being out of the 
classroom, stuck behind a desk. 
</P>
<P>
In January of 1988 she announced that she had accepted a job in a six-school 
unified district in Willits and purchased a farm about 30 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone questioned why I was doing this," she said. "They thought I was a 
Looney Tune, that I needed help." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Laytonville thought much the same. Locals have seen big-city 
bailouts come and go before. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people that have been here 20 years that are still considered 
newcomers," she said. "Of the real locals, there is a sense of snobbery, a kind 
of 'what are you doing here?' attitude about them." 
</P>
<P>
Carberry hoped to teach physical education when she arrived, but spent most of 
the year in charge of detention classes at a middle school. But she did coach 
the fifth, sixth and seventh grade track team, a job she liked. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get back to the student level," she said. "In administration on 
the college level you are as far from the students as you can be." 
</P>
<P>
Small-town perspectives are reflected in athletes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco is three hours away. They don't see big time athletics much 
here. So they think the efforts they give are the best. Our best here just 
won't do against teams from Southern California. They think they are better 
than they really are." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they are fortunate not to know what they are missing. Carberry has a 
62-mile round trip to work now. It takes 50 minutes to get there. 
</P>
<P>
"In L. A. it took me that long to go nine miles to work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The western slopes of the Coastal Ranges received 20 inches of snow last 
winter. For the first time in her life, Carberry had to put snow chains on her 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned what black ice was, too," she said. "I had heard stories about it. 
They say we don't get snow here, but 20 inches is a lot." 
</P>
<P>
What will the future hold? One gets the impression that Laytonville isn't the 
last stop. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what happens," she said. "There are a lot of possibilities. They 
don't move really quickly here, but I would like to get into the high school. 
</P>

IZOR, DFG TO STUDY SAND BASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Stanton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little is known about the habits of sand bass except that they travel the 
waters between Baja and Southern California's sandy beaches. According to the 
state Department of Fish and Game, there is no documented biology on the bass 
that invade local waters each summer to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
Where they come from and where they go after spawning remains a mystery -- one 
that Russ Izor of 22nd Street Landing in San Pedro plans to solve. 
</P>
<P>
Izor recently met with the Los Angeles County Fish and Game Commission and was 
granted the funding he needs to complete a three-year study. Izor and the DFG 
have combined efforts, setting up a tagging operation using Izor's boat, the 
First String. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Greagory and Mac Oliphant, DFG biologists, made the first tagging trip 
last week, along with 26 volunteer anglers. 
</P>
<P>
With floodlights on, the boat traveled along Southland beaches, catching and 
tagging small fish, then placing them in bait tanks and transporting them to 
Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The fish were released at Lone Point, on the south side of Catalina, a 
hard-bottom spot that Izor said was suitable for a possible sand bass fishery. 
The second of three tagging trips is planned next month at Portuguese Bend off 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers who catch sand bass or any other tagged fish are urged to turn in the 
tags to the DFG in Long Beach and divulge when and where the fish were caught. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing tournament: On Sunday, the Cabo Assn. of Boat Owners will hold its 
second fishing tournament of the season. Fishing will be in Horseshoe Kelp. 
Fish targeted for the event are bass, yellowtail, halibut and white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Information: 714-894-1537. 
</P>
<P>
Southland catches: Ed White of Long Beach, fishing off Catalina, caught the 
whopper of the week -- a 38-pound yellowtail found in floating kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Benton of Lomita won the jackpot with a 33-pound white sea bass while 
fishing aboard the Blackjack at Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
Gery Geer of Harbor City won the jackpot aboard the Shogun with his 32 
1/4-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Parks of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Aztec, caught a 23-pound white 
sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Buchanon of Long Beach caught a 14-pound white sea bass while fishing 
on the Matt Walsh at the rock pile off Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Fish reports: Sand bass and barracuda are providing most of the surface action 
in the Southland, and white sea bass catches continue to set the pace at 
Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme: The Elli M fished locally and caught 130 calico bass and 22 
rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard: The Island Tac out of Cisco's Sportfishing landed 87 calico bass, 54 
rockfish and one halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire found the calico bass eager to grab 
the bait. Anglers returned with 170 calico bass and 15 sand bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman, on two half-day trips, caught 275 calico bass and four halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod trip resulted in 250 deep water reds plus one cow cod and 
two sole. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray, on a twilight trip, landed 147 calico bass 
and 113 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special, on a half-day trip to Rocky Point, returned with 225 
calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack fished Catalina and landed 80 calico bass, 52 barracuda and seven 
white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Isle of Redondo had a weekend count of 1,120 mackerel, 37 rockfish and 12 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
22nd Street Landing: The First String worked Catalina and anglers caught 147 
barracuda, 112 bonito and 75 calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Monte Carlo, on a half-day trip to Horseshoe Kelp, took in a variety of 30 
calico bass, 23 barracuda and 19 sand bass. 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Sportking worked the flats and anglers caught 
255 sand bass, 112 barracuda and 75 calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits fished Catalina successfully with tanks of squid. Anglers 
totaled 120 calico bass and 12 white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh water notes: Dan Deets of Hermosa Beach caught an eight-pound bass at 
Castaic Lake. Gene Millove of Hawthorne fished Santa Ana Lakes and landed a 
10-pound white sturgeon.

9-BALL IS THE GAME OF CHOICE; YOU CAN FIND IT EVERYWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most popular form of pocket billiards is 9-Ball. Almost any pool hall you 
walk into plays host to 9-Ball tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"The game of the '80s and '90s," said Bob Johannis, day manager of College 
Billiards Center on El Cajon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Nine-Ball is played in rotation with the balls numbered one through nine. The 
lowest numbered ball on the table is the object ball, the player sinking the 
nine-ball -- either directly or in combination -- winning. 
</P>
<P>
There are a handful of pool halls in town. The biggest is the College Billiards 
Center. Other top pool halls include Victor's Lounge, O'Connell's Sports 
Lounge, Terry's Pool Place, the Hungry Stick, and the Clairemont Cue Club. Two 
other hot spots in the area are Green Felt Downs in Vista and Embassy Room in 
Oceanside. SCOTT MILLER

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First came Paul Newman and "The Hustler." Later it was Tom Cruise and "The 
Color of Money." That might be Hollywood, but you can't walk into a pool hall 
in San Diego without the images of Cruise and Newman lingering over a corner 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, you can try. You can sit in a pool hall, watching a waitress knife her way 
through a smoky haze while listening to the strains of Percy Sledge above the 
pops of pool ball on pool ball. 
</P>
<P>
But then, Bob Johannis, the day manager at the College Billiards Center -- San 
Diego's biggest and oldest pool hall -- brings up Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Color of Money' gave pool a shot in the arm," Johannis says, expelling a 
puff of smoke. "It was flashy and showed a guy in different situations, going 
around meeting different types of people. It helped sell the game again. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't mean guys dance around the table the way Cruise did, twirling 
their cue sticks like a baton and whipping them around. Especially when a guy 
has paid $500 or $1,000 for a cue stick." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Swanson, known professionally as Swanee, sits across the room. He's ranked 
12th in the country by the Men's Professional Billiards Assn. He returned from 
Germany two weeks ago, and he's leaving tonight for a championship tournament 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The color of money? First prize in the Las Vegas tournament is $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Every pool room in the country has a waiting list at night since 'The Color of 
Money' came out," Swanee says. "I didn't really like the story. The kid got 
smart, but too smart. He started dumping games off and betting the other way 
just for the money. That's why Newman said, 'I'm on my way back.' " 
</P>
<P>
Maybe a dozen tables are in use on this hot, lazy afternoon at the College 
Billiards Center. Voices are low, cigarette smoke is thick, and life is easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Be right with you, Earl," Johannis calls out to a regular. 
</P>
<P>
Any place which attracts a teacher from one high school and a couple of 
students from another, maybe two hours after the final bell, can't be all bad. 
Jerry Schimke, a 45-year-old literature and journalism teacher at Poway High 
School, sits on one side of the room. Chris Asad and Eric Gainey, who will 
graduate Saturday from Crawford High School, are at a table on the other side 
of the room. All three had finished their school year earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
On Father's Day, Schimke had taken his 20-year-old daughter, Amy, to the 
Billiards Center for a few games. Later in the week, he plans to take her on a 
trip through Ireland, Scotland and Wales. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what you find here are lots of exceptional people who seem to be 
easily bored," said Schimke, who just completed his 18th year teaching at 
Poway. "People who like to see life on the fringe. You can meet some incredibly 
interesting people. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's a character. Everyone will tell you off. One of the apostles could 
come in here and people would say, 'Hey pal, you can't come in this hall with 
sandals.' Or if St. Paul were sitting on the table, someone would toss him out 
for that. And there's too much smoke. Everyone smokes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some dirt going on, but there are also doctors, lawyers, teachers and 
college professors. It's the only place I know where you can sit at the bar 
with a beer and talk about the human condition. I had a two-hour talk yesterday 
about existentialism. You won't get that in a bowling alley, at home . . . you 
won't even get that at school." 
</P>
<P>
The College Billiards Center has 17 pocket billiards tables, one cushion 
billiards table, one snooker table and two coin-operated pool tables. You'll 
find regulars and newcomers. "The Color of Money," says Johannis, seems to have 
brought in a new crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Now that they're 18, Gainey and Asad can play late. You have to be at least 16 
to enter the College Billiards Center, and you can't stay past 10 p.m. unless 
you're at least 18 and have valid identification. Gainey and Asad play here a 
couple of times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"This place doesn't close until 2," Asad said. "That's another cool thing." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the College Billiards Center, which opened in April, 1963, is the 
biggest pool hall in town. The Billiard Tavern, on Broadway downtown -- which 
had about 50 tables -- is changing management and will re-open sometime next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a beginner, there are a few regulars at the College Billiards Center 
who offer lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times we'll help people out," Johannis said. "If somebody is doing 
something bad, I'll tell them. You pay back what you've learned." 
</P>
<P>
Schimke recommends lessons for beginners. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only sport, except maybe golf, where people enter tournaments 
before they know the rules," he said. "People come in here and do the 
metaphorical equivalent of driving a golf cart on the greens. You don't walk in 
here, rent a table and then put a pitcher of beer on the table or sit on the 
table." 
</P>
<P>
If you're already a terror on the pocket billiards table in your basement, 
there are plenty of tournaments around town. You can find one almost any night 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Billiards By-Line, in its fifth year, is published in San Diego, available for 
free at most pool halls, and includes listings entitled "Upcoming Events" and 
"Where to Go." Or you can join the U.S. Pool Players' Assn., be apprised of 
various tournaments and get your own handicap. A USPPA tournament -- with 
handicaps -- is held at the College Billiards Center every Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these tournaments are for the average Joe in a bar to put in $5 for a 
few laughs and good times," said Jerome Garnsey, 35, who helps editor Kathleen 
Klein put out Billiards By-Line. "It's like anything else. If you want to 
become a professional race car driver or pool player, you do it every day. San 
Diego is starting to boom in terms of getting more publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Garnsey doesn't compete much anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Once upon a time, I gave them a good run," he said. "But it's something you 
have to play every day if you want to get serious about it." 
</P>
<P>
Johannis said he has been playing pool for 41 of his 54 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I started playing at the YMCA on 8th and C in San Diego," Johannis said. "That 
was like playing in a cow pasture. There were big holes in the cloths, the 
chalk had holes in it, the cue sticks were in need of constant repair." 
</P>
<P>
There are several rules posted at the College Billiards Center to help avoid 
these problems. No sitting on tables. No masse or jump shots (difficult shots 
which, when attempted by beginners, usually produce ripped cloths and 
stationary balls.) No loud or abusive language. No fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't only for serious pool players, this is also for guys who want to 
bring their wives and kids in here," Johannis said. 
</P>
<P>
The first rule on the list, though, is "No Gambling." That's a state ordinance. 
There are, to be sure, times when this rule is broken. 
</P>
<P>
"If you behave yourself, you won't get hustled," Schimke says. "You won't get 
hustled unless you ask for it. If you walk in drunk and lay $100 down on the 
table, then it's plastic teeth time." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the boozy, pool hall fight over a high-stakes game is strictly 
Hollywood, say a handful of people this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen a fight in a long time," Swanson said. "If there's any trouble, 
we all get in on it and stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Garnsey: "It's never out of hand. I've never been in a place in San Diego 
where there was a fight over a game. Probably the most you ever run into is a 
fight over whose quarter is up next. I've broken up many of those." 
</P>
<P>
Asad and Gainey shoot pool for fun, not for money. 
</P>
<P>
"Having to put up with the person who wins for the rest of the day is worse 
than paying money," Asad said. 
</P>
<P>
But pocket billiards is like any other sport. Sure, you can watch movies about 
pool sharks. Yes, you can play for money. But the bottom line is, most of the 
players play because they enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Schimke: "Don't believe 'The Hustler' or 'The Color of Money.' That's not 
the way it is. This is a game of psychology played with pool balls. You're 
expected to figure out what to do, how to do it and you can't get nervous doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the professionals, such as Swanson. He went to Germany last 
month to gamble and said he "did all right." He makes his living by playing 
pool and said he makes about $40,000 in an average year by playing in as many 
as 12 to 15 major tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
His income could be supplemented in the near future if he accomplishes a 
current goal, which is to open his own pool hall. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego needs more pool halls," he said. "There used to be 20 or 30 around. 
Now there are only four or five." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"There was a phase when pool wasn't doing anything, and this is an outdoor 
town," Swanson said. "A bar used to be four pool tables and a spittoon. Now, 
you can get cocktails, watch Monday Night Football on a big screen television . 
. . anything you want." 
</P>
<P>
So that leaves a void Swanson would like to fill. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people come in here every day," he said. "Since 'The Color of Money,' 
pool has boomed." 
</P>
<P>
It's getting back to where it was after "The Hustler" came out.

COMPUTER FILE: SAFE WORK SPACE CAN AVERT INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard O'Reilly, RICHARD O'REILLY designs microcomputer applications for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the first things you learn upon acquiring a personal computer is how 
difficult it is to fit on a desk. There are all those parts -- the main 
computer box, a monitor, a keyboard, probably a printer and maybe an external 
disk drive or an external modem or even a CD-ROM drive. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a lot more to setting up a computer properly than just finding a 
place to put everything and enough electrical outlets to plug the equipment in. 
</P>
<P>
Your health and well-being may even be at stake. Federal, state and local 
officials across the nation have been looking into the growing number of 
computer-related repetitive motion injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Experts suggest several precautions for avoiding such injuries. One of the most 
important considerations is placing the keyboard and the monitor at comfortable 
heights for typing and viewing. You also need to put the computer unit where it 
can be easily switched on and off, with its floppy disk drive conveniently at 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, what happens is that the monitor is placed on top of the 
computer unit, both are shoved to the back of the desk and the keyboard is set 
in front of them. The printer ends up wherever it will fit within stretching 
distance of the umbilical cable linking it to the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Several things can be wrong with that scenario, according to recommendations 
adopted by the American National Standards Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The basic ergonomic principles endorsed by ANSI are easy to describe: You 
should sit upright with your feet flat on the floor and your knees bent at 
about 90 degrees. Your lower back should be supported, and your arms should be 
at about a 90-degree angle when your fingers are on the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
(ANSI standards say any forearm angle between 70 and 135 degrees is acceptable 
for keyboard work. However, medical and ergonomics experts that I have worked 
with say 90 degrees is the optimum.) 
</P>
<P>
Further, you should not have to look up at any part of your display screen. The 
top part of the screen (not the case) should be no higher than eye level. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on your size, it may be difficult to achieve that optimum position. 
</P>
<P>
You also need to have enough room under the desk or table for your knees and 
feet, preferably a space at least 24 inches wide and from 19 to 24 inches deep, 
depending on how long your legs are. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation for a good computer work space is a good, adjustable chair. A 
secretarial style chair is better than an executive style chair with big arms 
that interfere with arm movement while you work at the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
"A well-designed chair will favorably affect posture, circulation, the amount 
of effort required to maintain posture and the amount of strain on the spine," 
according to ANSI standards. 
</P>
<P>
The standards also specify that "reclined posturesare acceptable, (but) they 
require that the chair provide adequate support." 
</P>
<P>
Well-designed chairs can be adjusted for seat height, back support and tilt 
angle. The minimum range of height adjustment should be from 16 to 20.5 inches, 
according to the ANSI standards. Seat width should be at least 18.2 inches, and 
the width of the lower back support should be at least 12 inches. The standards 
make no recommendation for height of the seat back. 
</P>
<P>
Chairs that have pneumatic tubes for height adjustment are easier to use but 
may tend to lose pressure and sink while you are seated unless the quality is 
very good. Chairs that use screws for mechanical adjustments are more difficult 
to change but stay where you put them. 
</P>
<P>
Chair adjustability is critical because that is how you assure that your hands 
and arms are at the proper height and angle for the keyboard height, if the 
keyboard surface is not adjustable. In addition, shorter people may find that 
when their chair is high enough, their feet can't rest flat on the floor. A 
variety of footrests are available to support your legs and feet in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
With adjustable furniture, proper keyboard height for most persons falls in the 
range from 23 to 28 inches high, according to ANSI standards. Few manufacturers 
offer such furniture, however, so you'll probably have to compensate with chair 
height. 
</P>
<P>
Most computer furniture has a single work surface to support keyboard, CPU and 
monitor. You should choose such furniture for proper typing height. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing to remember about the monitor is to keep it low. Looking 
down as low as 60 degrees below horizontal is acceptable. 
</P>

"People who wear bifocals or trifocals and who adopt a reclined posture may 
have a reduced range of acceptable viewing angles," the standards say. They 
also may have more problems with glare from ceiling lights. 
</P>
<P>
If you have room on the desk top, you usually can get the monitor at an 
acceptable height by putting the CPU to one side so that the monitor rests 
directly on the work surface. The CPU can also be placed on its side behind the 
monitor or beside it or under the desk, as long as you can still conveniently 
reach the disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
Stands to support the CPU on its side are available from computer dealers as 
are special extension cables if your power, keyboard or monitor cords are too 
short to reach. 
</P>
<P>
Common sense should dictate the width and depth of your work space. Certainly, 
it should be deep enough to house your computer equipment without forcing the 
keyboard into your lap. There is no standard acceptable depth, but my 
experience shows it to be a minimum of 24 inches, and 30 inches is preferable. 
</P>
<P>
A standard of 19.9 inches for width of a work surface was set by ANSI, but a 
lot of computers are wider than that. You shouldn't have much trouble finding 
furniture that is considerably wider, and the wider the better. 
</P>
<P>
If you find that your present setup doesn't meet these standards, you're not 
alone. I've been amazed at how rarely computer furniture actually does, 
including my own. It will be worth the effort and money to make things right, 
however, if you spend very much time at your machine.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOY SAUCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Is there a difference between Chinese and Japanese soy sauce? And 
what about light and dark soy sauces? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to Bruce Cost, author of "Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients" 
(William Morrow &amp; Co., 1988: $22.95), "The Chinese invented soy sauce, and 
the Japanese learned the technology from them. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese, particularly in the south, use both light and dark soy sauce. The 
latter is aged longer, and toward the end of the processing is mixed with bead 
molasses, which gives it a darker, caramel-like hue. You can think of them as 
you would red and white wine, since as a rule, dark soy flavors (and colors) 
heartier dishes, particularly those with red meat, whereas light soy sauce is 
more appropriate with seafood, vegetables, soups and in dipping sauces. 
Traditional northern Chinese cooks use only dark soy sauce," says Cost. 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to explain, "The art of making soy sauce was introduced to Japan by 
the Chinese about 1,000 years ago, and since that time the Japanese have 
developed distinguished varieties to meet the needs of their cuisine. Whether 
Japanese or Chinese, the aging and fermenting are the same, but as a rule, 
Japanese soy sauce (shoyu) contains more wheat and is thus a little sweeter and 
less salty. Standard to Japanese cooking is what they call 'dark' soy sauce, 
which is labeled simply 'soy sauce,' shoyu, or koi-kuchi shoyu. This sauce, on 
a Chinese scale of dark to light, would fall on the light end, and in a pinch 
could be substituted for Chinese light soy." 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is canola oil and where may one buy it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Canola, the newest oil currently available, has the lowest percentage of 
saturated fat of all common fat and oil products on the market. It is 94% 
saturated fat free and, like all vegetable oils, is free of cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Canola oil is made from a tiny, black Canadian oil seed that is a cousin of the 
rapeseed plant. The oil is marketed in the United States as Puritan Oil. You 
should be able to find it in most supermarkets. Health food stores are another 
source.

 ABOUT WINE: GRACE CABERNET: SHORT IN SUPPLY, LONG IN DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. HELENA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Basic economic theory says that if the supply of an item is limited, the demand 
will be high and thus price is sure to be high. 
</P>
<P>
When the product is one of the best Cabernet Sauvignons made in the world, the 
price usually reflects its quality; in this rarefied atmosphere, wine lovers 
ignore the price and hock their cars to get some of the precious nectar. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case with the Cabernets of Dick and Ann Grace, the wines of the 
Grace Family Vineyard, a tiny Napa Valley winery whose wines are not only next 
to impossible to find but so good that they command ludicrously high prices at 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 12 bottles of varying sizes of Grace Cabernet, each with 
hand-painted labels, sold for $42,000 at the ninth Napa Valley Wine Auction. 
The buyer, a Florida wine shop owner, said he would put them on display. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, these items are collectibles and, as one-of-a-kind, defy the 
traditional supply/demand equation. So the prices are somewhat artificial. But 
all the rest of the Graces' production fits the equation perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Measured in Bottles 
</P>
<P>
That's because the entirety of the Grace Cabernet world is measured in bottles, 
not cases. In 1986, for example, the Graces made only 1,380 bottles of wine off 
their 1.05 acres of land. This wine is not actually commercially available. The 
290 persons on the Grace mailing list who are permitted to buy wine directly 
from the winery all buy the maximum permissible: four bottles. 
</P>
<P>
And at $50 a bottle. Even though the price is elevated, most folks on the 
mailing list would happily buy a case or two if permitted. Moreover, 600 other 
names are on a waiting list to get a few bottles of magic from this miracle 
vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
There is another way to get a bottle of this wine. Paul Smith of Northridge 
Hills Liquor, David Breitstein of Duke of Bourbon in Canoga Park, Steve Wallace 
of Wally's in Westwood, and Doug Margerum of the Wine Cask in Santa Barbara all 
carry a few bottles of Grace Cabernet. They sell them only to their best 
customers, a bottle at a time, usually at prices higher than Grace's. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Grace himself is a curiosity -- self-effacing on one hand and proud to the 
point of egotism on the other. The pride is in the wine he makes from vines he 
planted himself as a family project; the modesty flows from his dedication to 
his adopted valley and to his family. 
</P>
<P>
It began for Dick and Ann as fear. The fear was that they were too successful. 
At the time, in 1975, they were in Orinda, living the good life. 
</P>
<P>
He was a stock broker, a star at Smith Barney in San Francisco, one of that 
firm's top-10 salesmen every year in a company that had more than 2,000 sales 
people. His life consisted of hard work followed by party time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was concerned that the kids would leave home and think that life consisted 
of tennis, golf and cocktail parties," said Dick. "I wanted to give them 
something more." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, on a trip to the Napa Valley, the Graces found a 3.5-acre parcel of 
land on the west side of Highway 29 north of St. Helena on which sat a run-down 
Victorian home and old olive trees. After a quick tour of the land, they wrote 
out a $1,000 check as a deposit and bought the place. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Richmond and Laurie Wood, both then with Freemark Abbey Winery across the 
road, helped Grace decide what variety of grape to plant. "We didn't want to 
plant what we wanted, but what the land wanted," said Dick Grace. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, Freemark Abbey's viticulturist, and Richmond, now with Acacia Winery, 
both said Cabernet was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
So over the next year, the family planted. The three kids who might have seen 
little more than the inside of a country club now lived in the country, and on 
weekends they lined up stakes and drove them into the ground, strung wires, dug 
holes and planted vines. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no idea we would make wine," said Grace. "It was a family project, 
that's all. We didn't know what we'd do with the grapes." 
</P>
<P>
Today his attitude has changed: "I'm just the custodian for the valley. We have 
to preserve this area or we'll lose it." 
</P>
<P>
To some degree, this vineyard has saved Dick Grace's life. 
</P>
<P>
It is a life that to some seemed inordinately successful. In his best year, 
Grace earned an extremely handsome salary. Yet his life was lived at rat-race 
pace and led to what Grace perceived as weakness. 
</P>
<P>
He thought that he was drinking too much alcohol. Even after he moved to the 
idyllic Napa Valley, the pace of his life merely got more hectic. 
</P>
<P>
"My typical day was, I was up at 4:05, on the road at 4:25, into my office by 
5:45," he said. Then, armed with two double espressos, he would push hard 
without a break from 6:10 a.m. through the end of the Wall Street day. 
</P>
<P>
"I was addicted to adrenalin. I did not leave the office, even to take a coffee 
break, until the stock market closed," he said. "After work, at about 1:30 
p.m., I'd have a small lunch -- and four or five beers." 
</P>
<P>
The "four or five beers" routine was becoming a crutch on which Grace couldn't 
permit himself to lean. He wasn't an alcoholic in the traditional sense: "I 
never drank in the morning, I never drank alone, I was never picked up (for 
driving while intoxicated). And I rarely if ever had an excessive consumption 
of wine. But when I drank too much, I realized that I was overdoing it. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcohol wasn't interfering with my life, but it was an aspect. It was an 
enabler of very grandiose behavior. Sometimes I became a little more 
cantankerous. After a while I realized I could have a better life and run a 
better winery (if I stopped drinking alcohol)." 
</P>
<P>
So 18 months ago, he quit, cold turkey. 
</P>
<P>
It bothers him that some may feel that his abstinence from wine will indicate 
that he recognizes the harm in it. But he puts it in perspective for others: 
"There are benefits in wine for many people, but for me, at this time in my 
life, I don't need it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marine Discipline 
</P>
<P>
The discipline he shows in this, inculcated during a four-year stint in the 
Marines as a captain, has helped Grace gain greater control over his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I no longer have the need to be No. 1; I have consciously cut back on the 
intense adrenalin needs," he says. 
</P>
<P>
These days, he goes to his San Francisco office only three days a week. The 
other two days he spends in front of a Quotron machine on his desk at his home 
in the completely refurbished Victorian that also serves as the home for Ann's 
personal venture, the Napa Valley Mustard Co. 
</P>
<P>
The mustard business was founded in 1982 by Ann, Susan Simpson and Ruth Rydman. 
Today, the company produces three gourmet mustards and a gourmet catsup. 
Mustard case sales hit 18,000 in 1988. The three flavors are a Dijon-style 
herb-flavored mustard, a green chile/garlic and a sweet hot. 
</P>
<P>
The company hopes to hit $1 million in sales by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Grace Cabernets are exceptional. Running through them in late 1987 in a 
vertical tasting Grace staged for wine writers, I noted that these wines avoid 
the vagaries of vintage variation in that every wine, regardless of the 
vintage, achieves a degree of harmony rarely found in wines of Grace's 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
This, he says, is the product of being small. He can (and does) walk through 
the entire vineyard and pull suckers off the stalk, unclog emitters from the 
drip irrigation system for a single vine, and taste the grapes from each block 
of the vineyard and decide if they should be picked. 
</P>
<P>
"This area of the vineyard," he says, sweeping his arm in an arc over the 
southern tip of two rows of vines, "wasn't picked last year because we tasted 
the grapes and they tasted too vegetative." It meant that he made 115 cases 
instead of 125 cases. But the 115 that were made are great, he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Grace kids, they have grown up well, certainly not in the mold of 
rich kids with annuities and no prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk, 29, is now assistant vineyard manager for the new St. Supery Vineyards in 
Oakville, south of here; Mark, 27, is Boston-area sales representative for the 
Robert Mondavi Winery, and Kimberly, 25, works in sales and marketing for the 
San Francisco Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
The Graces' production is growing. They'll have 225 cases of the 1988 Cabernet 
and by 1990 hope to have as much as 400 cases, with a newly planted vineyard of 
0.95 of an acre providing nearly half of total production. 
</P>
<P>
And how does Dick Grace know when he has a good wine, now that he's not sipping 
any of it? 
</P>
<P>
"The nose still works," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1986 Chappellet Chenin Blanc ($6.50) -- One of the last 
remaining dry Chenin Blancs on the market, this delightfully melony wine is 
crisp and a sure bet to fool your local wine snob. A cross between Chardonnay 
and Sauvignon Blanc at a fraction of the price.

 LET'S EAT OUT: LOWER CALORIES, HIGH QUALITY OF LA FAMIGLIA FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time I was in La Famiglia in Beverly Hills I spotted Dino Martin 
sitting at a booth digging into his gnocchi. Gnocchi? What's that we asked at 
the time. That was almost 15 years ago. Now, of course, we know. We know all 
about pasta all Checca, pesto and primavera, and all the new Italian dishes 
that have happily entered our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, the cozy, comfy place was jam packed with gorgeous Westside people 
and celebrities, the food was glorious and the price high. But who cared? We 
were happy. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I was back last week after a long absence and, lo, there was Dino Martin 
sitting at the same booth digging into his gnocchi. So was his agent, Mort 
Viner, who, says owner Joe Patti, lost 35 pounds eating his low-cal food. The 
cozy and comfy clubby restaurant is still jam packed with gorgeous guys and 
gals, the prices are still high and the food has risen to new heights of 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, I stopped at La Famiglia because I heard Patti had been serving 
low-cal, low-sodium, low-cholesterol Italian dishes. Bravo Patti. He's in tune, 
he knows and he cares. And, more important, he's smart. He knows that already 
many restaurants are moving toward the direction of dietary considerations. And 
the sooner the better. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modern Cuisine 
</P>
<P>
Patti was one of the first Italian restaurateurs to introduce modern Italian 
cuisine back in the '70s, when Los Angeles was a wasteland of hanging Chianti 
bottles, fake grapes and heavy tomato sauce. Patti's sophisticated neighborhood 
restaurant has survived with flying colors, despite the high mortality rate of 
neighborhood restaurants in Beverly Hills, perhaps because he's not only 
keeping up but anticipating. 
</P>
<P>
His health-conscious cooking came into the picture a few years ago, when his 
eldest son developed a medical problem requiring careful attention to 
preservatives and additives, fat, sodium and cholesterol. "I started reading 
labels. Then I started checking our own food supplies and made changes," said 
Patti. 
</P>
<P>
The nice thing is that the menu doesn't ram "health food" down your throat. You 
can pick anything from the menu and tell the waiter to keep it on the 
low-cal/cholesterol/sodium -- or whatever -- slant. Just ask. 
</P>
<P>
But there is also a group of specialita nostra dishes containing no butter or 
flour that have been designated as healthful on the menu for those looking for 
them outright; things like poached eggplant Parmigiana, which was as light as a 
feather and absolutely the best I've eaten anywhere, the thin sheet of melted 
cheese (low-fat, I trust) notwithstanding. There is also a poached whitefish, 
pollo al vino bianco (poached chicken in wine) and vitello casalinga (veal made 
Paillard-style: pounded thin and grilled) served with wonderfully fresh, 
steamed vegetables also recommended for low-calorie dining. A shrimp scampi, 
which is generally loaded with butter, is on the list too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiter Will Help 
</P>
<P>
If it's low-cal/fat/cholesterol pasta you want, the waiter will guide you. On 
one visit our waiter suggested pasta with fresh tomatoes (all Checca) or 
primavera. I tried the primavera because of the extra vegetables you get on top 
and it was splendid. Filling, yet fresh and light. 
</P>
<P>
There is an idyllic steamed vegetable plate that looks like a Matisse painting. 
If you're on a weight-loss diet, you can't go wrong there. A beautiful plate of 
fresh asparagus was brought to the table with low-cal dressing, which was hard 
to dissect and I forgot to ask about. 
</P>
<P>
The grilled dishes are also a good bet if you're on a weight-reduction regimen. 
They will make you feel pure while purging your body of oils, flours and 
butters. 
</P>
<P>
Well, halfway through the meal we cheated. I couldn't take my eyes off the 
gnocchi on Dino Martin's plate. His was topped with a thick marinara sauce 
reminiscent of the kind you get in the East Coast neighborhoods. "His family is 
from Abruzzi and that's the way he likes it," said Patti. "But you can have it 
with a lighter marinara sauce. Practically no oil. Want to try it?" What's a 
little cheating among good friends, so I said, "OK." And I wasn't sorry. The 
gnocchi, unlike the bullets I've bitten into in my time, were tiny pillows of 
fluff. It was definitely one of the lightest gnocchi's I've had. 
</P>
<P>
We tried La Famiglia for lunch earlier and ordered a wonderfully light, low-cal 
chopped salad with poached chicken. You can have it with seafood or other meats 
too. Also a good choice is the insalata nostra (house salad), made with hearts 
of palm, green beans, mushrooms and lettuce in a dressing based on tomato and 
balsamic vinegar. The poached white fish is another good choice. The menu is 
flexible and so are the waiters, so ask and you shall receive. 
</P>
<P>
For more casual lunching or dining (with price break), you can go next door to 
Piccola, Patti's cafe where most all of the dishes offered in the restaurant 
can also be ordered. 
</P>
<P>
If you're dining with a non-dieter, he or she need not fear. There are plenty 
of ways you can go hog-wild on calories. The special on the menu the night we 
were there was osso buco. I would have killed to order it, but, of course, 
refrained. There is also excellent bistecca peperonata (pepper steak), cutlets 
Parmigiana, chicken alla cacciatori, steak and peppers, a number of fresh 
pastas (including tortelllini with meat, cannelloni filled with chicken, beef 
or veal, ravioli filled with chicken and risotta. 
</P>
<P>
You have dry pastas topped with meat sauce, prosciutto and eggs, olive-caper 
sauce, four cheeses, pepper and sausage, shrimp and clams and others. Fish 
offerings (salmon with lemon and capers, sole with lemon butter, scampi with 
tomato sauce and poached swordfish are among them. You can also order a broiled 
live Maine lobster (at market value) if you are so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Price of Dining 
</P>
<P>
Prices are not low, as we already warned. In fact, expect to pay anywhere from 
$15.95 to $20.95 for pasta alone. The meats range in the mid-$20 and appetizers 
under $10. 
</P>
<P>
We were ready for dessert. There was plenty of room, having gone light on 
dinner. The waiter, diplomatically overlooking our digression over gnocchi and 
keeping in line with our pristine program of low-cal eating, suggested assorted 
fresh fruit for dessert. But that wasn't exciting enough for Patti, who doesn't 
miss a thing when he's around. He butted in with a suggestion to try melon with 
berries. "No calories there," he said. "But how about creme caramel?" 
</P>
<P>
"But that has cream," I said.

Here is a refreshing, wholesome dessert -- a ginger-flavored angel cake topped 
by a lemon cream and fresh peaches. 
</P>
<P>
When making the cake, be sure to sift the flours as directed or the whole wheat 
flour will weigh down the batter. 
</P>
<P>
Good news for party planners -- the cake can be made up to two days ahead, 
wrapped in plastic and stored in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

sugar over egg whites 1/4 cup at time and continue beating until egg whites 
reach soft peaks that retain shape. Gently fold in ginger paste. 
</P>
<P>
Sift together whole-wheat pastry flour and white cake flour. Sift again, then 
sift over egg whites, stirring gently until well combined. 
</P>
<P>
Spray 12 inch tube or bundt pan with non-stick spray. Spoon cake batter into 
pan and run rubber spatula through surface to eliminate air holes. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 425 degrees 35 to 40 minutes, until tester tests clean. Remove from 
oven and let cool in pan. 
</P>
<P>
Unmold cake from pan and cut into 10 pieces. Place each piece in serving bowl 
and cover with Peach and Lemon Cream. Let stand several minutes before serving.

GUAVA: RIPE TASTES OF THE TROPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN WILLIAMS, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guava, its friends say, when ripe, smells just like a dream of the tropics: 
sweet, fruity, distinctive. Beware of underripe guavas, however -- they remind 
sniffers of the musky smell of zoos or locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The flavor of ripe guavas is as endearing as their scent. The fruit's slightly 
grainy flesh, which ranges in color from white to hot pink, calls up allusions 
to strawberries and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brought Home by Columbus 
</P>
<P>
Native to South America, Central America and the West Indies, guavas were first 
brought to a European audience by Columbus's crew. And, indeed, in the United 
States they are best known in Latin American cooking. 
</P>
<P>
However, they are also found in other tropical or subtropical corners of the 
globe, including India, South Africa and Greece, where the seed-filled fruit 
has been spread by migrating birds. 
</P>
<P>
Most commercially grown guavas that are consumed in the United States come from 
Australia and New Zealand, or they are grown domestically in California and 
Florida (Delicious guavas are abundant in Hawaii, but because they are subject 
to fruit-fly infestation, cannot be shipped to the mainland). Guavas are best 
known in the United States in nectar or paste (goyabada) form, and are also 
made into a candy that is popular in Mexico. All of these can be found at 
groceries that carry Latin American foodstuffs. But the fruit can occasionally 
be found fresh, too, at markets that carry gourmet produce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ripen Unrefrigerated 
</P>
<P>
The fruits are pear-shaped or ovoid. Select fresh-looking specimens, slightly 
tender to the touch, and allow them to ripen unrefrigerated. A deep yellow 
color and that lovely aroma will be the guide to ripeness. When they have 
ripened fully, guavas can be refrigerated, but they should be used soon, or the 
flesh may become unpleasantly sandy. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh guavas can be eaten raw when very ripe. (A number of small hard seeds are 
clustered near the heart of the fruit. The seeds, while edible, can be 
obtrusive.) For eating out of hand, wash and trim away the stem and blossom 
ends, then halve and scoop out of the shell. Firmer fruit can be used for jams 
and jellies, sliced in a fruit salad and the pulp pureed for sauces, sorbets or 
mousse. Guava also makes a fine liqueur. 
</P>
<P>
The nutritional reward will be plenty of Vitamin A (especially in the pinkest 
varieties) and more Vitamin C than citrus fruits. Guavas are also low in 
calories.

SUIT ACCUSES MARCOSES OF $5-BILLION CRIME SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, employed a 
series of elaborate financial schemes to build illegally a $5-billion fortune 
during his 20 years in office, the Philippine government has alleged in new 
documents filed in federal court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The documents, in providing the most detailed account to date of how the 
Marcoses' wealth was accumulated, attempt to portray the couple as 
sophisticated schemers who ran the nation as if it were their personal 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
They describe, for instance, how the Marcoses allegedly received payment of $20 
million in interest by a Philippine bank. The bank paid the couple for the 
"privilege" of using money that the Marcoses had looted from the national 
treasury, the documents allege. 
</P>
<P>
Filed late Tuesday to amend a 3-year-old civil suit lodged by the Philippines 
against the Marcoses, the court papers allege that the Marcoses embezzled 
Philippine money and property and extracted kickbacks from foreign and domestic 
companies doing business in the Philippines. They allege further that the 
Marcoses stole money from government-owned financial institutions, converted to 
their own use foreign aid money designed to benefit ordinary Filipino citizens 
and engaged in illegal money laundering to conceal the funds from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was originally filed in June, 1986, in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. The case, one of several actions pending against the couple, is being 
pressed in the United States because the Philippine government believes that 
many of the Marcoses' assets are now in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks $50 billion in damages. The theory of the case is that Marcos, 
from 1965 to 1986, ran the Philippines as a racketeering enterprise. Last year, 
the Marcoses were indicted in federal District Court in New York based on a 
similar set of allegations. There also are 39 cases pending in the Philippines 
seeking to recoup money and other assets that the Aquino government contends 
the Marcoses obtained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos left the Philippines on Feb. 26, 1986, shortly after it became clear 
that a majority of the citizenry had shifted its support to current President 
Corazon Aquino, the widow of one of his longtime rivals. Today, Marcos is 
believed to be gravely ill in a Honolulu hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The papers filed this week represent "the most complete (public) description to 
date" of the Marcoses' alleged illegal activities, said Ronald L. Olson. Olson 
and Alan D. Bersin head a team of lawyers at the Los Angeles firm of Munger, 
Tolles &amp; Olson, which is representing the Philippine government. 
</P>
<P>
The documents include a list of bank accounts controlled by the Marcoses and 
their associates, including the numbers of accounts of three banks in the 
Philippines, seven in Switzerland, five in Hong Kong, one in Lichtenstein, and 
one in England. 
</P>
<P>
The documents also list numerous corporations, some of them "dummy firms" and 
several sham foundations used to perpetrate the alleged racketeering acts in 
the Philippines, the Netherlands Antilles, the Grand Cayman Islands, the 
Channel Islands and other places. 
</P>
<P>
Another exhibit is a 23-page U.S. Customs Service inventory of the thousands of 
gems and other property and cash that the Marcoses took to Hawaii in February, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
These include, for example, a set composed of a bracelet, earrings and a brooch 
consisting of sapphires, rubies and diamonds valued at $1.5 million by the 
Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
The jewels were brought into the country on one of two planes provided to the 
Marcoses by the Reagan Administration when they fled the Philippines. Much of 
the inventory consists of expensive jewelry, often multiple copies of the same 
item, and several million dollars in Filipino pesos. 
</P>
<P>
A red russet leather suitcase contained 93 separate jewelry items, ranging from 
a $5 earring to a brooch of Burmese ruby and diamonds worth $290,000. The 
inventory also included five handguns. 
</P>
<P>
All of the possessions contained in suitcases, crates, attache cases and boxes 
are still in the possession of the Customs Service in Honolulu. The Marcoses 
are attempting to regain control of the guns, jewels and money in an action 
currently pending in federal court there. 
</P>
<P>
The Marcoses and "their accomplices" used a bevy of dummy corporations, sham 
foundations and other entities to facilitate the illegal deals starting in 
1965, according to the third amended complaint in the complex lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit -- formally titled Republic of the Philippines v. Ferdinand E. Marcos 
et. al. -- asserts that the Marcoses violated U.S. law by transporting stolen 
money to the United States and concealing investment of the funds through 
cronies and offshore companies. 
</P>
<P>
There currently are nine defendants in the case: Marcos and his wife, now 
living in Honolulu; Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian mogul now in custody in 
Bern, Switzerland; Roberto D. Benedicto, a longtime Marcos associate who is now 
a fugitive from federal criminal charges in New York stemming from many of the 
same incidents described in the Los Angeles case; the California Overseas Bank 
in Los Angeles and Redwood Bank in San Francisco, which allegedly were 
controlled and misused by Marcos and his associates; and three offshore 
corporations, Krodos Properties, N.V., of the Netherlands Antilles, Al Djebel 
Corp. of the Cayman Islands and Lei Investments Ltd. of the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Bartko, a San Francisco attorney who represents the Marcoses, was 
unavailable for comment Wednesday. Frederick J. Hoey, chief administrative 
officer of Redwood Bank, said he had not been served with papers in the case 
and therefore would not comment. Lawyers or representatives of the other 
defendants did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations contained in the lawsuit are based substantially on information 
gathered by a special Filipino commission created to investigate the Marcoses 
after they left the country. 
</P>
<P>
The court documents allege that some of the illegal acts have continued since 
the Marcoses fled to Honolulu in February, 1986, in direct violation of a court 
order issued here in June, 1986, by U.S. District Judge Marianna R. Pfaelzer 
freezing their assets worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, according to the documents, a foreclosure sale was conducted in 
February, 1988, in order to transfer ownership of a large Beverly Hills house 
to Krodos, the Netherlands Antilles company, "in order to conceal" the 
Marcoses' partial ownership of the property, which was once owned by actor 
George Hamilton. The papers assert that the sale was conducted in violation of 
Pfaelzer's order. 
</P>
<P>
The papers also assert that Pfaelzer's order was violated by Marcos setting up 
a phony $200-million line of credit agreement with Saudi Arabian businessman 
Mohamaad Al-Fassi. The purpose of this arrangement, according to the papers, 
was to allow Marcos to move some of his hidden funds into a new account in 
order to circumvent the asset freeze. 
</P>
<P>
The papers contend that $2.4 million was moved illegally and spent before 
Al-Fassi's attorney, Richard Hirschfeld, told a congressional committee in 
July, 1987, that he believed Marcos planned to use the money to invade the 
Philippines and seize power. 
</P>
<P>
After Hirschfeld testified, the U.S. government ordered Marcos not to leave 
Honolulu. He currently is in St. Francis Hospital, being sustained by 
life-support machines. 
</P>
<P>
Many other transactions also are delineated in considerable detail. They 
allege, for instance, that from July, 1965, to February, 1986, the Marcoses 
garnered $53 million in "kickbacks" on contracts negotiated between the 
government and seven Japanese as part of a war reparations treaty. 
</P>
<P>
And the papers list a number of companies controlled by Marcos, his family 
members and associates, including firms used to siphon off from the government 
treasury proceeds from the sale of sugar, coconuts and other commodities. 
Between 1975 and 1978, the Marcoses illegally obtained $7 million as a result 
of sales from one sugar contract, the documents state.

FLAG BURNING AS PROTEST UPHELD; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH COURT TAKES STRONG STAND FOR FREE EXPRESSION IN TWO CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, taking a strong pro-First Amendment stand in two tough tests 
of free expression, ruled Wednesday that flag burning is protected by the 
Constitution as a form of political protest. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a second decision, the justices said that a newspaper may not be 
punished for reporting the name of a rape victim that was obtained from police. 
</P>
<P>
The two rulings suggest that the high court is continuing to take a broad view 
of the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech and the press, even as it 
cuts back on earlier civil rights positions. Two of former President Ronald 
Reagan's appointees -- Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy -- joined 
the majority in Wednesday's rulings. 
</P>
<P>
The flag-burning case, which began as a symbolic radical protest at the 1984 
Republican National Convention in Dallas, became a classic test for the 
justices over the true meaning of the flag and the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbol of Free Speech 
</P>
<P>
The five justices in the majority said that the flag symbolizes the nation's 
commitment to free speech and debate, which requires protecting even 
"offensive" and "disagreeable" political ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"The way to preserve the flag's special role is not to punish those who feel 
differently about these matters. It is to persuade them that they are wrong," 
Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in dissent, said that he could not fathom 
how a government that can order soldiers to "fight and perhaps die for the 
flag" may not punish persons for "the public burning of the banner under which 
they fight." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's ruling was a surprise to most civil libertarians and appears to 
strike down as unconstitutional similar laws enacted by the federal government 
and every state except Alaska and Wyoming making it a crime to burn or 
desecrate a flag. 
</P>
<P>
"The death of civil liberties was premature," said University of Colorado Law 
Dean Gene Nichol, a First Amendment expert. "This was a decision that the 
Warren Court was scared to make." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s, the Supreme Court and then-Chief Justice Earl Warren dodged 
rulings on whether burning a flag was a protected form of protest. Twenty years 
later, when radical protests have faded and patriotic support for the flag has 
reached a peak, a more conser vative court has decided to settle the question. 
</P>
<P>
The case began during the week that Republicans gathered in Dallas to nominate 
Reagan for a second term. A small band of radical protesters marched through 
the streets chanting: "America, the red, white and blue. We spit on you." They 
seized a flag from a bank building, set it on fire and watched it burn. For 
this act, a protest leader, Gregory Johnson, was arrested, convicted, fined 
$2,000 and sentenced to one year in jail for violating Texas law. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's case reached the Supreme Court last October while Republican 
presidential candidate George Bush was making the flag a key campaign issue and 
was denouncing his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, 
for having vetoed as unconstitutional a law mandating that all school children 
be required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance each day. 
</P>
<P>
Civil libertarians and political radicals feared that the current conservative 
court would use the case to cut back on the right to protest mainstream views. 
Instead, the high court reaffirmed its 40-year-old doctrine that free 
expression is protected so long as it does not create a clear danger of 
"imminent lawless action." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had engaged in an "overtly political" act of "symbolic speech," which, 
while offensive to many, did not threaten to "incite a riot," Brennan wrote for 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment," he added, "it 
is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply 
because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as Strengthening Flag 
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old Brennan, who read much of his opinion from the bench Wednesday, 
said that the American flag has a "deservedly cherished place in our community" 
but that the flag would be "strengthened, not weakened, by our holding today. 
Our decision is a reaffirmation of the principles of freedom and inclusiveness 
that the flag best reflects and of the conviction that our toleration of 
criticisms such as Johnson's is a sign and source of our strength." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, although joining the opinion, said in a concurring statement that he 
found the outcome "distasteful" but was nevertheless compelled to concur by the 
"pure command of the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
"The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like," 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Rehnquist derided Brennan for giving a "regrettably patronizing 
civics lecture" on free speech and the flag. He argued that, although 
protesters are entirely free to speak ill of the President, the Republican 
Party or the flag itself, they are not free to burn a flag. 
</P>
<P>
"The American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has 
come to be the visible symbol embodying our nation," Rehnquist wrote. "The flag 
is not simply another 'idea' or 'point of view' competing for recognition in 
the marketplace of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
In a second eloquent and emotional dissent, which was read from the bench, 
Justice John Paul Stevens said that creating a right to put "graffiti on the 
Washington Monument" or "spray paint on the Lincoln Memorial . . . might 
enlarge the market for free expression, but at a cost I would not pay. 
Similarly, in my considered judgment, sanctioning the public desecration of the 
flag will tarnish its value . . . . That tarnish is not justified by the 
trivial burden on free expression occasioned by requiring that an available, 
alternative mode of expression -- including uttering words critical of the flag 
-- be employed." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Brennan and Kennedy to form the majority in the case (Texas vs. 
Johnson, 88-155) were Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liberal Activists Pleased 
</P>
<P>
Liberal legal activists, who were angry at the court last week because of its 
rulings on civil rights, said that they were pleased with the decision 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's ruling is a victory for free speech. Offensive or not, those who burn 
the flag to express their views are exercising a right that our founding 
generation fought a revolution to secure," said Arthur Kropp, president of 
People for the American Way. 
</P>
<P>
Radical lawyer William Kunstler of the Center for Constitutional Rights, who 
defended Johnson, said that the ruling prohibits "the state from making the 
flag a religious icon. It holds (that) our Constitution allows the people to 
choose and express whatever meaning they choose for the flag, even where that 
expression is deeply critical of the country for which it stands." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing the Veterans of Foreign Wars and AMVETS called the ruling 
"an outrage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carte Blanche to Protesters 
</P>
<P>
"Americans have a unique reverence for the flag, and the court seems to have 
treated it as just another symbol," said Alan Slobodin of the Washington Legal 
Foundation, which filed a court brief for the veterans' groups. "This opinion 
appears to give carte blanche to all kinds of extreme protest, whether it is 
KKK demonstrators burning a picture of Martin Luther King or Nazis marching in 
Skokie." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the court has said that police may limit protests and marches to 
ensure public safety but that they may not ban a form of protest simply because 
of its disagreeable message. 
</P>
<P>
In the other First Amendment case, the court said that a news organization may 
not be punished for accurately reporting the name of a rape victim lawfully 
obtained from police. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-3 vote reversed a Florida court verdict awarding $97,500 to a 
Jacksonville woman whose name was reported, inadvertently, by a small weekly 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Florida makes it a crime to release or publish the names of rape victims. In 
this case, the police mistakenly released the name, and the newspaper, in 
violation its own policy, printed it. 
</P>
<P>
The case was seen as a potentially major test of a newspaper's constitutional 
right to print truthful information versus a victim's right to privacy. 
However, Justice Marshall said that the court's ruling is "limited." Because 
the government itself had released the information, the justices concluded that 
the paper could not be fined for printing it. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion (Florida Star vs. B.J.F., 87-329) adheres to a series of rulings 
from the late 1970s upholding the news media in printing court documents, but 
it stops short of giving the press absolute immunity when it prints accurate 
information. Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor joined Rehnquist 
in the dissent. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Wednesday, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruled, 8 to 0, that the American Bar Assn. may continue to meet secretly 
and give advice to the Justice Department on potential judicial candidates 
(Public Citizen vs. Justice Department, 88-429). Both liberal and conservative 
legal groups have said that the ABA should be considered an official advisory 
body and hold open meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruled, 5 to 4, that railroads may sell off parts of their lines without 
bargaining with their unions (P&amp;LE vs. Railway Labor Executives, 87-1859).

ORANGE COUNTY GI PLEADS GUILTY TO SPY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County soldier Michael A. Peri pleaded guilty Wednesday to espionage 
charges for giving East German officials U.S. defense secrets and assessments 
of Soviet troop strengths, saying he was "frustrated" with his military job. 
</P>
<P>
Peri, 21, a 1985 graduate of La Quinta High School in Westminster, faces a 
maximum punishment of life in prison, said Sgt. Maj. Dale McInnis, spokeswoman 
for the 5th Army Corps in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing nervous at times during the four-hour hearing at the U.S. Army 
Community Center in Fulda, West Germany, Peri told a military judge that he 
crossed into East Germany on Feb. 20 because he felt overworked and 
unappreciated in his job as an intelligence specialist (Spec. 4). In that job, 
Peri, a member of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment based in Fulda, analyzed 
Communist troop movements and electronic signals. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't have a plan," Peri said, according to a report by Stars and 
Stripes, the military newspaper. "My primary reason was to leave behind all the 
frustrations and problems at work. Everything had been wrong. I wasn't enjoying 
myself. I wanted to start over somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Peri also testified that he was curious about Soviet military operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking at Soviet forces on paper, and I wanted to see it first-hand," 
he said. "That played a part in my decision." 
</P>
<P>
Peri said he took a lap-top computer containing secret information with him 
because: "It was a bargaining chip to keep them from doing something to me. It 
would show them I wasn't an American plant." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he realized that the information he passed to East German 
officials was likely to be harmful to the United States and advantageous to 
hostile nations, Peri responded, "Yes, sir." But he said he did not realize the 
extent of potential damage until he was questioned by intelligence experts upon 
his return to Fulda. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony Wednesday, secrets passed to the East Germans included 
information about U.S. tank and helicopter movements along the border between 
East and West Germany defense plans for West Germany, and American estimates of 
Soviet military forces in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Army prosecutors plan to call three intelligence experts to testify about the 
potential damage to the United States and European allies during sentencing 
proceedings expected to continue through Friday in Fulda. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom was cleared of spectators several times during Wednesday's 
hearing when classified information was discussed. Among those in attendance 
were Peri's parents, Fred and Winnie Peri, and his sister, Desiree, all of 
Laguna Niguel. Family members were permitted to meet with Peri the night before 
the hearing and again Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The soldier was handcuffed as he was led in and out of the hearing at a 
military courtroom about a quarter-mile from the Army post. All entrances to 
the building were guarded during the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Peri, who had been considered a model soldier, said he was angry that he had 
not been permitted to accompany the rest of his unit on a survival training 
mission and feared that he would not be allowed to go on a planned trip to 
Spain because of his heavy workload. He told Col. Craig G. Jacobsen, the 
military judge, that he had not been recruited by East German agents. 
</P>
<P>
His testimony revealed only sketchy information about his activities and 
movements during the 12 days he was missing. One of the unexplained elements 
remains a train ticket from Austria, found in Peri's possession when he 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
Peri was reported missing Feb. 21. Fears that he had crossed into East Germany 
arose two days later, when a Jeep-like vehicle he had signed out was found a 
mile from the Communist border near the village of Obersuhl. He returned on 
March 4, walking through the gates of the base at Fulda. 
</P>
<P>
Peri testified that he dressed in civilian clothes and entered East Germany by 
climbing a border fence. He said he walked south along a patrol route until he 
was spotted by East German soldiers and taken to a nearby military post. East 
German officials who did not identify themselves interrogated him in Berlin and 
in several "safehouses" throughout his stay, Peri said. He said he asked to 
return to the West on March 3, when the East Germans asked him if he wanted to 
stay or leave. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the espionage charge, Peri pleaded guilty to being absent 
without leave, violating an Army regulation prohibiting unauthorized travel by 
soldiers within one kilometer of the border and theft of a military vehicle and 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
The guilty plea reversed Peri's previous innocent plea and followed a pretrial 
agreement, the terms of which military authorities declined to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
Peri was described by relatives in March as "a very together young man" who 
followed his older brother into the Army. 
</P>
<P>

APPARENT TOXIC GAS PRANK AT SCHOOL HURTS 26 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An apparent prank on the last day of school spread a cloud of toxic chlorine 
gas through the main building of a Dana Point high school Wednesday, injuring 
26 students and staff members and prompting the evacuation of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The gas is believed to have resulted from brake fluid mixed with chlorine 
tablets in a trash can at Dana Hills High School, Orange County Fire Department 
officials said. The incident occurred as students took their last final exams, 
50 minutes before classes were scheduled to end for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven students and five teachers and staff were taken to three hospitals 
suffering from upper respiratory problems. The two most seriously injured were 
female students, listed in fair condition, with the remainder in good 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Principal's Reaction 
</P>
<P>
"I guess this was someone's idea of a prank, but it's more serious than a 
prank," said Principal John Smart. "I'd like to think they did not intend 
harm," Smart said as students and teachers were given oxygen nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County firefighters turned the high school parking lot into an emergency 
treatment center and set up decontamination baths, stripping and scrubbing the 
injured behind curtains of yellow plastic held up by assistants, before loading 
them into ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department Battalion Chief Ron Blaul said chlorine gas is a respiratory 
irritant, which can kill if a substantial quantity is inhaled. In smaller 
amounts, it can cause chemical burning of the lungs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gas cloud forced the evacuation of about half of the school's 2,290 
students. The remainder were in portable classrooms not affected by the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred shortly after 11 a.m. inside "the mall," a two-story 
rectangular building with school offices, theater and classrooms around the 
perimeter. The center of the building is an atrium-like enclosed area with a 
two-story ceiling with skylights. The chemicals were inside and next to a trash 
can near a stairwell by the theater, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A campus proctor first noticed the smoke and alerted custodians, who removed 
the trash can from the building, authorities said. Fire officials said they 
were alerted to the fumes at 11:16 a.m. A spokesman for the school district 
said classes were evacuated at 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Students left final exams and belongings at their desks and filed outside. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous material team members, wearing head-to-toe protective gear and full 
respiratory equipment, went into the building about 1 p.m. to cart out the 
remaining hazardous material for analysis.

A pan-Islamic effort to unite Muslim nationalities in Soviet Central Asia 
fueled the recent wave of ethnic unrest in which 99 people died, an official of 
the Uzbekistan republic said. The organizers wanted an Islamic "holy war" in 
which they would drive non-Muslim groups out of Uzbekistan, the official 
charged, stating the aim as "the revival of medieval nationalist hysteria, 
discrimination and ousting of the republic's European population." When the 
Meskhetians, a minority Muslim group of Turkish descent, declined to join 
Uzbeks in the front, violence flared between the two groups.

Federal investigators have asked the Navy to retrieve a cargo door that tore 
off a United Airlines Boeing 747 jet over the Pacific nearly four months ago, 
sending nine passengers to their deaths. The door is believed to be resting on 
the ocean floor more than three miles under water and about 85 miles southwest 
of Honolulu. United and Boeing would share in the cost. A National 
Transportation Safety Board spokesman said the Navy was asked to search for the 
door, but the Navy said it has not received a formal request. NTSB 
investigators have said retrieving the door would help determine what caused it 
to pop open at an altitude of 22,000 feet on Feb. 24.

Burmese troops fired on a demonstration by about 500 people in a Rangoon 
suburb, killing one protester, Rangoon Radio reported. It was the first 
reported fatal shooting by security forces in the nation's capital since the 
army took power in a bloody crackdown last September. Burma's main opposition 
leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, was detained after a scuffle broke out while she was 
laying wreaths to honor 1,000 demonstrators killed a year ago by the military, 
official sources said. Aung San Suu Kyi, 44-year-old daughter of assassinated 
independence hero Aung San, and 15 followers rounded up with her were released 
after an interrogation, the sources said.

A research technician died a week after he contracted a rare form of herpes 
from a bite or scratch by an infected laboratory monkey. The virus, common and 
harmless in Old World macaque monkeys, "is very rare among humans but proves 
fatal in 70% of the people who catch it," said Dr. William Hall, chief of 
disease surveillance for the Michigan Department of Public Health. Hall said 
state health officials are monitoring 21 of the technician's co-workers at 
International Research Development Corp. in Mattawan, Mich., who have been 
bitten or scratched by the laboratory monkeys. The 23-year-old technician, 
whose name was withheld at his family's request, was infected with the "B" or 
"monkey" virus while working with Old World macaque monkeys.

The Panamanian military has agreed to participate in talks toward ending the 
political crisis involving Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, the 
government said. The military will be included in the government delegation, 
Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said in a letter to the Organization of American 
States. The talks among the government, military and opposition were proposed 
last week by an OAS mission, which has made two trips to Panama City since the 
government annulled a May election that observers said the opposition won 
handily. The government had insisted that the role of Gen. Noriega, Panama's de 
facto leader, is "not negotiable." But a Foreign Ministry statement, which 
included parts of Ritter's letter, did not mention Noriega.

Health officials are working on a plan to increase the number of patients San 
Francisco General Hospital can accept, especially poor and uninsured patients 
who are apparently being diverted in an attempt to placate community hospitals 
threatening to drop out of the 911 emergency ambulance system. Dr. David 
Werdegar, public health director, said the new city budget would enable the 
hospital to staff 40 to 60 more beds with nurses compared to the past year, 
which would help curb the number of diversions. Lynn Baskett, spokeswoman for 
the Hospital Council of Northern California, said the diversion practice has, 
during a busy month, cost the nine private hospitals participating in the 911 
system up to $200,000 each. "It's felt like the city was solving its budget 
problems by being on (ambulance) diversion," she said. "And there was no 
incentive not to divert. It saved the city money. And the patients got cared 
for."

Vietnam turned over the remains of 28 people believed to have been American 
servicemen missing since the Vietnam War, and it plans to give U.S. officials 
another 16 sets of remains. Maj. Dan Trout, a U.S. spokesman, said a 21-member 
U.S. military team received the remains at a ceremony at Hanoi's international 
airport. Trout said the 28 remains were delivered in wooden boxes, inspected by 
a U.S. forensic expert and then transferred to aluminum caskets. The caskets 
were loaded onto a C-141 transport aircraft and flown to Hawaii for 
identification at a U.S. military laboratory.

BIDS TAKEN FOR RANCHO SECO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

The utility that operates the Rancho Seco nuclear plant is taking bids for a 
takeover of the power station that voters decided to close. The decision by the 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District to take bids angered many of the 
activists who have fought for years to shut down the plant, which has a history 
of operating problems. The board majority argued that the ballot measure in 
which the electorate decided to close the plant does not forbid someone else 
from running it. The sale of Rancho Seco would save the community the 
$200-million to $300-million cost of shutting it down, said Joseph Buonaiuto, 
board president. Voters had decided in a non-binding referendum to close the 
plant, agreeing with opponents' arguments that it is unsafe and uneconomical, 
and a majority of the utility board agreed to abide by the outcome. The plant 
was taken out of service and so far about 400 contract workers have lost their 
jobs. The vote marked the first time citizens have decided to close an 
operating reactor.

Afghanistan said the 15-week-old guerrilla siege of Jalalabad has ended with a 
government victory and that troops are pushing the insurgents toward Pakistan. 
Guerrilla leaders, however, denied that the bloodiest battle in the decade-long 
war was over, and there was no way to verify either claim. Jalalabad, the 
capital of Nangahar province and once the country's fifth-largest city, came 
under rocket and artillery bombardment march 7, three weeks after Soviet troops 
left Afghanistan to end their nine-year intervention.

Israeli jets bombed a Palestinian radical stronghold south of Beirut in 
Israeli's third air strike on guerrillas in Lebanon in a week. An official for 
the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General-Command 
said the jets struck the group's headquarters and two military positions in 
hills about 10 miles south of the Lebanese capital. Police said one guerrilla 
was killed and eight were wounded. An Israeli army spokesman said the positions 
"were used as command posts for the terrorist organization of (Popular Front 
leader) Ahmed Jibril." The front, a dissident group that split from the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, has denounced the PLO's recent softer tone 
toward Israel.

Arkansas legislators met in an emergency special session to re-pass hundreds of 
spending bills that were ruled invalid because the Legislature violated a 
requirement in the state's constitution. Virtually all state spending will halt 
July 1, when Arkansas' fiscal biennium begins, unless the legislators approve 
nearly 300 appropriations bills all over again. "I am embarrassed," state Rep. 
Jodie Mahony said of the procedural snafu during the regular session, which 
ended in April. "But it is an honest mistake." The special session convened 
after a specially appointed Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that the General 
Appropriation Act did not pass with a three-fourths majority.

The dinner reservation for Tuesday evening at a Santa Monica restaurant was in 
the name of the "Robinson" family. Getting together were the actors who 
portrayed the Robinsons in the 1960s CBS series, "Lost in Space," plus the 
real-life family of Guy Williams, the actor who starred as Professor John 
Robinson. They wanted to share their happy memories of Williams, who was found 
dead of an apparent heart attack May 7 in Buenos Aires. "Guy's professional 
family took his real family out to toast poppa," said June Lockhart, who 
co-starred as Williams' wife. Billy Mumy, Angela Cartwright and Marta Kristen 
of the TV family were there, along with Williams' wife, Jan, and their 
children. "We had a lot of laughs and remembered all the funny things Guy had 
done," Lockhart said after dinner. "Since Guy's death, I have had a lot of 
touching fan mail and expressions of grief. I don't think Guy really knew how 
loved he was, and I was able to pass all of that on to his family." In addition 
to "Lost in Space," Williams was also TV's swashbuckling masked hero "Zorro" in 
the late '50s. ALEENE MacMINN

A woman who underwent back surgery on live TV in Philadelphia earlier this week 
says she agreed to do it in hopes of helping others who may need the operation. 
"I don't feel invaded at all," says Deborah Arizin, 27, a sales representative 
from Haddonfield, N.J., who had suffered from back pain for more than half her 
life. The 2 1/2-hour operation to help correct a 50-degree curvature of Mrs. 
Arizin's spine took place on public television station WHYY. Station executives 
said the operation, broadcast live "for its impact and educational value," 
brought at least 330 calls from viewers who mostly found it "absolutely 
breathtaking" and "magnificent," though a few called it gory. ALEENE MacMINN

COUPLE'S FUSION IN 'KUNG FU' TOO FRENCH FOR U.S. TASTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>

Ah, the French. Up to their old tricks of making crazy Americans feel out of 
step with what these cosmopolites take so comfortably in stride. Take Agnes 
Varda's "Kung Fu Master!" (Goldwyn Pavilion Thursday), a movie devoted to the 
absolute denial of psychological effect. 
</P>
<P>
French to the core, it is about truly "crazy love," an affair between divorcee 
Mary Jane (Jane Birkin) -- who is 40 and lives with her two daughters, ages 6 
and 15 -- and 15-year-old Julien (Mathieu Demy), a schoolmate of her daughter 
Lucy's. 
</P>
<P>
Birkin herself wrote the original story, which Varda altered slightly and which 
is cast within the family and shot at Birkin's pretty, comfortable Paris house. 
Varda's own son, Mathieu, is the boy; Birkin's two daughters, 6-year-old Lou 
Doillon and 16-year-old Charlotte Gainsbourg, play her girls, Lou and Lucy. It 
doesn't help the creepy quality one bit. 
</P>
<P>
No one who saw the French "Devil in the Flesh" of 1947 could fail to understand 
the young married woman's fascination with that 17-year-old schoolboy. Director 
Autant-Lara made that absolutely clear, particularly when he cast Gerard 
Philipe as Raymond Radiguet's autobiographical adolescent, a boy struggling to 
manhood in the context of the First World War. 
</P>
<P>
That was youth; this is sub-adolescence. Indulge this movie to the hilt, and 
you still come back to the question of what is lacking in this adult woman's 
life that would make her rush to re-create the dopiness of an adolescent's 
first crush. Or why she is so quick to sacrifice the psychological well-being 
of the two children she already has for this particularly blank sweet kid. With 
a Gallic shrug, the film makers make no effort to tell us. It's a given. You 
know. Well, try my damnedest, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Jane, profession unstated, is struck by Julien after helping him throw up, 
since he has indulged in a nasty vodka-beer-wine mixture at Lucy's outdoor 
party. Mary Jane's younger daughter has a fever and, singing gently to her 
upstairs a little later, Mary Jane catches Julien studying her. She decides 
that he is "superb." 
</P>
<P>
After she runs into him, literally and only semi-accidentally, at the school, 
they share a Coca-Cola and she watches him, wrapped up in his favorite video 
game, Kung Fu Master, which he plays "with such skill and such passion." In it, 
the maiden on the top floor must be rescued by the little pajama-clad hero, 
after he vanquishes demons of every kind. 
</P>
<P>
Now, almost any woman will tell you that there is a powerful aphrodisiac in 
watching a man absorbed in something he does well, from messing with a car 
motor to putting a mathematical equation on a blackboard, to turning out an 
omelet. And there are qualities about adolescence that have their own 
undeniable appeal; a stray curl at the nape of a neck, an endearing bravado 
that covers inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
But watching a man, who may have a few more things in his head, and fixating on 
an absorbed child are two quite different matters. Except, perhaps, to the 
French. Beyond Julien's passion for his game, Varda doesn't tell us anything 
about him, except that he may want mothering. (Both his parents are a 
convenient continent away.) Actor Mathieu is big-eyed and grave and obviously 
the apple of his own mother's eye. But he is not terribly interesting and, 
rather than 15, he looks two or three years younger, which makes the movie feel 
really pathologic. (It is MPAA-rated R for the relative discretion of their 
nuzzling love scenes.) 
</P>
<P>
So when he begins to turn up with daffodils for Mary Jane, and she, our 
narrator, begins to talk about his phone calls, which "thrilled" her, the 
non-French mind may reel. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably this is shy, pure romance. A respite from "grown-up" behavior. An 
unpressured process of learning to love. Well, if Mary Jane lived by herself, 
that might be one thing. But she's responsible for two other young lives. And 
when she and Julien take off for her family's island -- taking 6-year-old Lou 
with them, abruptly leaving Lucy behind with her maternal grandparents -- where 
are our sympathies supposed to lie? Varda cares so little about anyone but this 
pathetic little couple that we're never even shown Lucy's reaction, as though 
her feelings were beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
And how are we supposed to feel about this semi-triste island idyll, just 
momma, her baby and her baby-love? What do we make of the moment when Mary Jane 
confesses shyly, "I'm too old for you. . . . I know I won't be around when you 
start shaving." The closest thing to a comment about little Lou's presence here 
is one shot of her, wailing, unattended, at the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
The movie makes much of French adolescents' understandable preoccupation with 
AIDS. The bottom line of AIDS is responsibility for those one cares about. 
Perhaps it is only the French who worry about sexual responsibility yet behave 
as though psychological responsibility was something only the unsophisticated 
troubled about. The unsophisticated and those crazy Americans.

AGNES VARDA: CONTROVERSY IN EYE OF BEHOLDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French director Agnes Varda at 61 is very much the same woman she was more than 
20 years ago when she first came to Hollywood. She herself admits to no great 
sense of time passing, except in the maturing of her children, Mathieu, who 
co-stars in her new film, "Kung Fu Master!" and is now going on 17, and 
Rosalie, 31, who designs costumes for the opera. 
</P>
<P>
Varda is short, compact, dresses simply and speaks with the wit and the 
matter-of-factness of her films, which include "Cleo from Five to Seven," an 
early work in France's New Wave, and the more recent "One Sings, the Other 
Doesn't" and "Vagabond." Varda still wears her dark hair in a short Dutch bob, 
and her gaze is as direct as ever. 
</P>
<P>
In her Chateau Marmont cottage, Varda complained about the unreliability of the 
TV, the phone and the plumbing, "but I love it. I love so much to be here. Los 
Angeles is where I feel good." Yet in returning to Los Angeles, where she and 
her husband, director Jacques Demy, lived and worked in the late '60s and for 
various periods thereafter, Varda found herself full of contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
She hated leaving her husband, currently stricken with a severe case of 
phlebitis; she hated being able to stay only long enough to promote "Kung Fu 
Master!"; and it disturbed her to find that in America the fight for a woman's 
right to have control over her own body was having to be fought all over again. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophisticated Frenchwoman, Varda is not about to allow her picture to be 
described as controversial simply because it involves an affair between a 
40-year-old woman, played by Jane Birkin, and a 15-year-old (Mathieu Demy), who 
is one of her daughter's classmates. "I don't see it as controversial," said 
Varda, with a firm, contemptuous dismissal. "I see it as off-center. Such 
relationships allow people to become different persons, to escape themselves. 
For the woman it was a chance to come back to the time of her adolescence, a 
much deeper need in her than sex. And it allows you to see what the boy needs. 
Boys want so much to become men, and all society tells them is to be good, to 
get good grades and to straighten their rooms." 
</P>
<P>
"Kung Fu Master!" grew out of "Jane B. by Agnes V.," which Varda describes as 
an essay on Birkin, a film portrait of the British actress and singer who has 
long resided in France. "I was trying to invent a new category. I was asking, 
what is an actress? How can she be herself? I showed her in excerpts of films 
that she's never done. I made her play Jeanne of Arc, a woman of the 
Renaissance and Stan Laurel. (Noted Italian actress Laura Betti played Hardy.) 
Jane said, 'You made me do all these different women. Why for once can't I be 
myself? With my kids, wearing jeans and no make-up.' 
</P>
<P>
"You remember, Jane was one of the models in 'Blow-Up,' and she's done a lot of 
French comedies that haven't been seen here. Then there was that famous song, 
'I See You . . . Neither Do I,' she did with Serge Gainsbourg where they did 
all those noises of love-making. It got banned by the Vatican. The Italian 
distributor even went to jail. After that, she was never received in Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, she had a lot of children -- three by three different men -- and 
became a grandmother. She's beloved by everybody in France, half the audience 
at her concerts is under 18. I couldn't believe it! But she doesn't behave like 
a frightening woman to young people. She's like a loving sister to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, she very shyly handed me a 10-page treatment which became the premise 
of 'Kung Fu Master!' She's very sentimental. What she wrote for herself was 
very good, but the boy in the story was a ghost. She saw him as 'Camille.' I 
said, 'Well, forget it. This is 1987-88. Forget the Marguerite Gauthier boy. I 
buy your sentimentality and nostalgia for adolescence, and I'll write the boy. 
It will be a woman in love with a boy not yet a man, but he would be passionate 
for video games.' Video games are important because they embody myths: David 
and Goliath, the pursuit of the Holy Grail, the freeing of Andromeda, the 
journey of Ulysses. 
</P>
<P>
"They both want escape, but freedom is an illusion, as we all know. It's an 
impossible love, but in terms of what it liberates in each of them, it's good. 
The boy doesn't have to be a man, they don't have to be a couple, and that's 
where they really meet. 
</P>
<P>
"So I said to Jane, 'You bring the woman, and I'll bring the boy and the 
society of today.' Kids have always been curious about sex and interested in 
love. It's always been difficult to be 14 or 15, but with AIDS the pressure is 
so much worse. I told Jane that I respected her feelings about wanting to be 
what she wanted to be and that she could be as near as possible to being 
herself, but that the story would be a fiction -- with the texture of reality. 
We shot in her house with her own children playing her children, and her own 
parents in London playing her parents." 
</P>
<P>
"Kung Fu Master!" was not the first time she directed her own son -- he played 
the child in her short 1981 narrative, "Documenteur" ("An Emotion Picture"), 
shot in Venice, Calif., in 1981 -- but it may be the last. 
</P>
<P>
"He says he doesn't want to become an actor," said Varda. "He says that only if 
he doesn't succeed in anything else he'll become an actor because it's the 
easiest thing in the world. His father and I are very amused at that." 
</P>
<P>
Varda resists the notion that she has come into her own in the past decade. 
"After 35 years I still have a hard time finding money," she said. "But I only 
make films that I love. Can you imagine the freedom that represents? All over 
the world people come up to Jacques and me and tell us how much they have loved 
our films. This is the real reward of the real artist."

'SPIRIT' OF COCTEAU PROVES ELUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"I don't know whether to say thank you or I'm sorry" is the way Deborah 
Slater's tribute to Jean Cocteau began at the Gallery Theatre in Barnsdall Park 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
That pretty much sums up the reaction of this writer to the strange 
triple-header in three short acts by different performers under the suspect 
title "In the Spirit of Jean Cocteau." 
</P>
<P>
Cocteau would have had grave difficulty finding his spirit in these pieces by 
Slater, Blue Palm (Jacqueline Planeix and Thomas Crocker) and Kedric Robin 
Wolfe. 
</P>
<P>
"Died Suddenly," written by Julie Hebert, was Slater's tribute: part 
voice-over, part movement, part acrobatics, traveling between a swing and a 
divisible couch. 
</P>
<P>
It made pronouncements and struck poses notable chiefly for the fact that they 
had no recognizable connection to Cocteau. 
</P>
<P>
Crocker and Planeix secured a personal safety net by invoking Cocteau's whimsy, 
throwing some French into their act (titled "Cocteau en Californie") and 
leaving it at that. Their bushy-tailed kidding around was Crocker and Planeix, 
with their miniature Eiffel Towers and inflatable blue palm, doing what they 
usually do: a sort of postmodern George Burns and Gracie Allen routine with 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was subdivided into still briefer routines that paid lip service 
to Cocteau, such as "Watching Cocteau" ("Watching Cocteau is like watching 
oneself watching Cocteau . . ." Hmmmm?), "Kiddie Korner Kokteau" (or what kids 
think of Cocteau, which is not much) and "Cocteau Eyewitness News at Ten" 
(don't ask). 
</P>
<P>
If Cocteau was playful, he was not silly or haphazard. The whimsy sprang from a 
fermenting intellect, the art had composition and style, the writing was 
emotionally anchored and intense. Such foolishness as "Cocteau was a typical 
Frenchman; he smelled bad and said smart things that were wicked" (from Kiddie 
Kokteau) is self-serving drivel that means nothing and demeans everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched between the other two acts, Kedric Robin Wolfe's "You Want to Know 
About Cocteau" came closer to the mark. He, at least, borrowed some of the 
poet-artist-playwright-film-maker's own words to tell us about the transports 
of love, Cocteau's despair at the death of Raymond Radiguet (the author of 
"Devil in the Flesh," dead at 20, over whom he fairly lost his head) and the 
uncharted mysteries of opium -- a particularly searing and beautiful account of 
one man's submersion and recantation. 
</P>
<P>
But why was it necessary to bend and twist the body while expressing all this? 
What did it lend beyond the possibility of a pulled muscle? And why the fright 
wig? Or the line down forehead, nose and chin, in a vain (both senses of the 
word apply) imitation of Cocteau's stylized drawings? Were there no mirrors in 
the dressing rooms? No directors to advise? 
</P>
<P>
None were listed. The show is come and gone and these questions are now largely 
rhetorical. But beginning Friday at the Gallery Theatre, this Cocteau Centenary 
Festival continues with "Jean Cocteau -- Mirror Image," a one-man 
interpretation by Ian Abercrombie of a text by Crispin Thomas. That show has a 
director (Robert Robinson) -- an encouraging sign.

STAGE WATCH : THE BARD ON BOARDS AT SANTA MONICA PIER; PROGRESS REPORT ON 
EQUITY-ATLAS TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Santa Monica Pier will become a theater in August. The Pacific Theatre 
Ensemble will venture out over the Pacific, presenting a Shakespearean comedy 
in a 200-seat space at the western end of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Admission will be free. The city is putting up $15,000 for the production, and 
the ensemble hopes to match that amount in a fund-raising campaign, said 
artistic director Stephanie Shroyer. This will be the first Actors' 
Equity-contract show for the ensemble, which has won acclaim for its 
smaller-theater productions of such shows as "Slaughterhouse on Tanner's Close" 
and "South Central Rain." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Theatre Ensemble won't be the only theatrical group on the pier. 
The Aresis Ensemble, formerly based at the Off-Main Street Theatre, plans to 
present a production of "Wozzeck" in a 49-seat space next to the carrousel in 
September, said the group's Charles Duncombe. Aresis has arranged to rent the 
space from the Pier Restoration Corp. for six months at $10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
CONTRACT APPROVED: The organization of smaller-theater producers, Associated 
Theatres of Los Angeles (ATLAS), has approved a new Actors' Equity contract 
that would allow smaller-theater productions to extend runs beyond the 80 
performances allowed under Equity's 99-seat plan. 
</P>
<P>
While the contract has yet to be endorsed by the Equity board, Equity already 
has used many of its provisions in an individual contract for "On Tina Tuna 
Walk," at the Zephyr. "Tina Tuna" will pass the 80-performance mark Friday. Its 
producers are not ATLAS members. 
</P>
<P>
The contract calls for a sliding scale of payments per actor per performance, 
from $20 for one performance each week to $15 for shows that give four or more 
performances each week. It also provides for payments to Equity's pension and 
health funds. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects are much darker for an Equity-ATLAS contract governing 
smaller-theater shows that move to larger theaters. "We have called a hiatus in 
the talks," said ATLAS chairman Laura Zucker, "because I didn't think we were 
getting anywhere." She wants the issues "to percolate in the community" before 
talks resume. 
</P>
<P>
The major issues, according to Zucker: Should the contract include provisions 
for part-time performance schedules (ATLAS says yes)? Should it cover theaters 
with as many as 399 seats (ATLAS' idea) or only 299 (Equity's)? And, she 
continued, "we're very far apart on money." She claimed that Equity "wants us 
to pay as much as 40%-50% of the gross to actors" under contracts "comparable 
to other cities. But we do not yet have the subsidies here to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Equity Western Regional director Edward Weston declined to respond to Zucker's 
specific comments, but he remarked that ATLAS officials "had (earlier) argued 
that the new 99-seat plan would be the end of small theater. They should 
reconsider their objections and be a little more realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Zucker's desire to let the issues "percolate," he said: "I'd 
rather negotiate than percolate. Let's keep the lid on the coffeepot." 
</P>
<P>
DIRECTORS STRIKE?: The Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers will 
strike the League of Resident Theatres if agreement on a new contract isn't 
reached by Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to reject the league's latest offer was taken at five union membership 
meetings -- in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago -- but 
only 18% of the members voted. Of 1,038 members, 114 voted to reject, 74 to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
The 67 league theaters include the Mark Taper Forum, South Coast Repertory, La 
Jolla Playhouse and the Old Globe. Thomas Hall, managing director of the Old 
Globe and president of the League of Resident Theatres, said Tuesday: "I don't 
have anything to offer at this moment that would hold out any hope" for further 
negotiations.

Chinese authorities, waging a mighty propaganda war to justify having sent in 
the army against unarmed protesters, rushed a paperback history of the 
pro-democracy movement to bookshops Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of copies of the slim, pale-yellow volume, titled "The Flag Must Be 
Bright to Go Against the Turmoil," were delivered to stores in central Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The book gives an official history of the demonstrations that erupted after the 
death in April of Hu Yaobang, the former reformist leader of the Communist 
Party. The government says the protests degenerated into a counterrevolutionary 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
The book covers events up to and including Premier Li Peng's May 20 decision to 
impose martial law on the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses and diplomats say many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died in 
the assault. But the Chinese government says about 300 died, most of them 
soldiers.

TURMOIL IN CHINA: CRACKDOWN ON DISSENT; 
</P>
<P>
EXECUTIONS EVOKE CHINESE SLOGAN: 'KILL A CHICKEN TO FRIGHTEN MONKEY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An old slogan from the Chinese Communist lexicon is popping back into 
conversations these days: "Kill a chicken to frighten the monkey." 
</P>
<P>
The sacrificial fowl, as it were, turns out to be three men who were executed 
in Shanghai on Wednesday for their allegedly violent roles in a protest 
movement that was overwhelmingly nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
The "monkey" consists of the more than 1,600 others detained so far in a 
massive sweep of protesters, the thousands more who face possible persecution 
for "thought crimes" and, by extension, the entire Chinese populace. 
</P>
<P>
And the fear is that the bloodshed witnessed when the People's Liberation Army 
advanced on Tian An Men Square on the night of June 3-4 may have marked only 
the beginning of a terrorizing ideological purge. 
</P>
<P>
Already, eight more people have been sentenced to death for allegedly battling 
martial law troops in Beijing and are awaiting the result of an appeal that is 
almost certain to be turned down. Another 17 defendants accused of "seriously 
endangering public order" were given death sentences, some suspended, by a 
court in the northeastern city of Jinan as thousands of spectators looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts are concerned that the due process set forth by China's fledgling 
legal code may be all but ignored, resulting in a wave of summary trials and 
executions of the sort used frequently in recent years to eradicate common 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Since the anti-crime campaign of 1983-84, justice has been dispatched with a 
bullet to the back of the head for an untold number of criminals, even those 
convicted of nonviolent transgressions such as embezzlement and theft. The 
government releases no data, but some Western analysts believe more than 1,000 
people are executed each year in China. 
</P>
<P>
In April, for example, a man was sentenced to death for pilfering $8,900 worth 
of loot in a burglary of the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai. Also that month, the 
deputy director of Beijing's No. 3 Leather Manufacturing Plant, a member of the 
Communist Party, was ordered put to death for embezzling nearly $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in its strident propaganda barrage on the airwaves and in newsprint over 
the last 17 days, the government has branded the pro-democracy demonstrators as 
"rioters" and "hooligans." That could spell mortal danger for some legitimate 
dissidents whose only crime was to take to the streets advocating more rapid 
democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's deep in the Chinese mentality that very bad people ought to be 
exterminated," said Jerome A. Cohen, an international lawyer in Hong Kong and a 
former professor of Chinese law at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
Said another foreign lawyer based in China for several years: "Clearly, when 
the Chinese are trying to make moral examples out of people, they don't blanch 
at capital punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Amid an escalating witch-hunt atmosphere, in which fugitives are being turned 
in by family members and friends, the fear of reprisals is so pervasive that 
potential victims of juridical excess do not dare speak out in their own 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
The government line is that the student protests on Tian An Men Square brought 
on a counterrevolutionary uprising aimed at destroying Communist Party rule -- 
a charge equivalent to sedition. 
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued Tuesday, the Chinese Supreme Court admonished the 
country's local courts to abide strictly by the law of criminal procedure, but 
it also said defendants accused of inciting social unrest or joining riots 
should be dealt with swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
The lightning trials of 11 people sentenced to death in Shanghai and Beijing 
last week disturbed Cohen, the legal expert in Hong Kong. Little more than a 
week elapsed between the arrests and sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of fairness can there be, with respect to the facts and the 
application of the law, unless there is time for a thorough investigation and a 
person has a chance to defend himself?" Cohen said in a telephone interview. 
"These aren't just American ideals -- they're written in Chinese law." 
</P>
<P>
Extensive television coverage of the arraignment of newly arrested suspects -- 
some of whom appear to have been physically abused -- has added to the 
show-trial aura of the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been no attempt to hide the fact that their faces are swollen and 
they've been beaten," Cohen said. "The summary nature of it and the appearence 
of these people suggests they have not been getting a lot of legal assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng set the tone for the prosecution by telling family members of 
three "martyrs" among soldiers who died in the attack on Tian An Men that there 
would be "no mercy" for the perpetrators of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite a lot of rioters are yet to be apprehended, and we can in no way leave 
them unpunished and let them stage a comeback," Li said in a stiff meeting with 
the soldiers' relatives shown on state television. 
</P>
<P>
One of the relatives, the tearful mother of a soldier who was hanged from a 
bridge by a mob and burned, was shown on the evening news broadcast five nights 
in a row being consoled by ranking government and military officials. 
</P>
<P>
The inexorable propaganda seems to have fallen short of whipping up anti-rebel 
hysteria among the vast majority of Chinese who did not witness the military 
atrocities at the beginning of the month. But it may succeed in tugging their 
emotions and confusing them enough to mold public opinion in the government's 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
The executions themselves fit into a pattern of propaganda that, in addition to 
"frightening the monkey" also professes to "kill one to educate 100," as 
another government slogan goes. Lowly criminals are put to death after public 
rallies, which are shown on television. Sometimes, dozens of the condemned are 
shot at once. 
</P>
<P>
Even this carnival of punishment is an improvement over criminal procedures -- 
or lack thereof -- exercised during the purge of landlords and the 
anti-rightist campaign of the 1950s or the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Deng Xiaoping regime revised the arrest law and adopted a formal code 
of criminal procedure in 1979, the rule of law was a fairly tenuous concept in 
China. Summary verdicts were issued by impromptu people's tribunals that might 
make today's trials seem favorable to the accused. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Common Commodity' 
</P>
<P>
"Death was once a fairly common commodity," one veteran observer recalls of the 
old China. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a death sentence today does not necessarily mean the end of the line for 
the condemned. The courts grant two-year reprieves, and sentences can be 
commuted for prisoners showing good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case of China's most famous inmate, Jiang Qing, the widow of 
Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung and head of the "Gang of Four," which was accused 
of trying to take over the government after Mao's death. Jiang, now 75, had her 
death sentence suspended after a highly publicized trial in 1980.

CROWE SEES GORBACHEV AS VISIT ENDS; 
</P>
<P>
KREMLIN LEADER SAYS TRIP SHOWS SHIFT TOWARD PARTNERSHIP

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the visiting chairman of the U.S. Joint 
Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday that his tour of the Soviet Union shows that the 
two superpowers are starting to see one another more as partners than 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. had sailed on a Soviet guided missile cruiser for a 
day, gone aboard a nuclear submarine in the Arctic port of Murmansk, visited a 
nuclear missile silo outside Moscow, sat in the cockpit of the newest 
long-range bomber, code-named Blackjack by NATO, and watched the Red Army try 
out new tactics in exercises in Byelorussia during a 10-day visit that he said 
had helped sweep aside misunderstandings between the two military 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
And when Crowe met Gorbachev in the Kremlin on Wednesday at the conclusion of 
the trip, the Soviet leader told him that his extensive tour of super-secret 
military and naval facilities was itself "the weightiest argument that our 
relations with the United States have risen to a new level of maturity." 
</P>
<P>
"The very fact that you have visited the Soviet Union and visited military 
facilities and units demonstrates that we are moving from the notion of enemies 
to the notion of partners," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that in the plans made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we are still 
considered to be adversaries. But the process is going along new lines, and 
that is extremely significant." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe, warmed by his cordial reception and impressed by the openness of the 
people he had met, told Gorbachev, "I now see that Soviet people are very much 
like Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"They put great emphasis on their families and homes," Crowe continued. "They 
want a better future for their children and decent security. They are very 
dedicated to their country. 
</P>
<P>
"These are all traits that Americans respect. Perhaps I had to visit the Soviet 
Union to understand this." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe, speaking later at a press conference, said that he agrees that 
Soviet-American relations are improving, but he added that there are "still 
differences in our points of view . . . namely on the arms control issue." 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere for discussing the differences has improved markedly," Crowe 
said. "I believe that we now have an environment in which we can talk candidly, 
that we can ask the kinds of questions that are important, that we can talk 
without rancor or emotion." 
</P>
<P>
His visit came as Soviet and American negotiators resumed talks in Geneva on 
reducing their strategic nuclear arsenals after a seven-month suspension to 
give the Bush Administration a chance to reassess the U.S. position. The two 
countries are also discussing reductions in conventional forces in Europe, the 
elimination of chemical weapons and restrictions on nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said that recent proposals by the United States and the Soviet Union for 
reducing nuclear and conventional arms made him optimistic about new 
agreements, but he cautioned that the pace should not be forced if flawed 
treaties would result. 
</P>
<P>
While he had discussed the negotiations with his Soviet counterpart, Gen. 
Mikhail A. Moiseyev, the chief of the Soviet general staff, and with Marshal 
Sergei F. Akhromeyev, Gorbachev's military adviser, Crowe emphasized that he 
had come to get a better understanding of the Soviet Union and its military, 
not to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"The most constructive thing that I did on this trip was to have personal 
conversations with the Soviet leadership," Crowe said, "and with those, we have 
been able to sweep aside some of the misunderstandings between us and clarify 
some of our differences." 
</P>
<P>
He had discussed at length what Gorbachev calls the Soviet Union's new defense 
strategy of "reasonable sufficiency," which would mean cutting the Soviet armed 
forces back to only what it needs to defend itself and releasing the other 
resources to develop the country and expand its economy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is change afoot in this country, politically and militarily," Crowe 
said, adding that he is willing to wait and watch for the implementation of the 
new policies. "As soon as a policy is announced, some people look out of their 
window and say, 'I don't see it.' These things take time, but I hope we will 
see the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe had signed an agreement aimed at preventing the accidental outbreak of 
hostilities between the two countries. Moiseyev described the pact as "a 
momentous occasion in the history of our relations." 
</P>
<P>
Its broad outlines had been discussed when Akhromeyev, then chief of the 
general staff, went to the United States last year as Crowe's guest and when 
Frank C. Carlucci, who was then secretary of defense, visited Moscow as the 
guest of Gen. Dmitri T. Yazov, the Soviet defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
With Moiseyev sitting beside him, Crowe described the Soviet armed forces as 
"competent, skilled, well-trained, durable, determined, very patriotic, with a 
good sense of humor and personable, and I return home with great admiration for 
them." To his mind, he said, the Soviet servicemen he met were very much like 
their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said that he has also come to understand how the Soviet Union's 
experience in World War II, in which an estimated 20 million of its people were 
killed, has helped shape the modern Soviet psyche, particularly the 
leadership's determination that never again will the country be invaded and 
never again will a foreign adversary put socialism at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw what a searing experience the war was," Crowe said.

FIRST FULL SESSION OF RENEWED ARMS TALKS HELD

U.S. and Soviet arms delegates on Wednesday held the first full meeting in a 
new round of negotiations on a treaty to cut each side's long-range nuclear 
arsenals by up to half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration was expected to propose verification measures aimed at 
speeding progress on the accord with the Soviet Union, but it is not clear when 
or in what detail the U.S. side presented its proposals. Both sides are 
observing an official news blackout in Geneva on the substance of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Bush on Monday proposed that the United States and Soviet Union begin testing 
verification procedures during negotiations on reducing long-range nuclear 
forces, rather than waiting until a pact is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The new chief Soviet arms negotiator, Yuri K. Nazarkin, said he will wait for 
formal submission of the proposal before commenting. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a treaty reducing each 
side's long-range, or strategic, forces is part of "the next phase" in 
disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
Nazarkin and the new U.S. chief envoy, Richard R. Burt, led their delegations 
in the first plenary session of the 11th round of talks, a 2 1/2-hour session 
at the U.S. mission. The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks began in March, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The round, due to last about six weeks, began Monday with a meeting of the two 
delegation heads. Rapid progress in the talks appears unlikely, since both 
sides have opposing positions on at least three major issues: the U.S. plan for 
space-based missile defenses, the long-range, sea-launched cruise missiles and 
the mobile intercontinental missiles.

Along with efforts on an arms treaty, negotiations are also resuming on space 
and defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets want to link agreements in the two areas, but Washington has 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Bush plan, both sides would begin tackling the tricky problem of 
verification early by testing on-site monitoring procedures during the talks, 
rather than after the treaty is finished.

FBI'S SESSIONS ELEVATES INVESTIGATIONS OF VIOLENT CRIME TO PRIORITY STATUS FOR 
AGENTS 
</P>

FBI Director William S. Sessions, citing a 40% increase in violent crimes over 
the last decade, Wednesday elevated violent crime to a "priority" status for 
FBI investigators, a move that will provide greater assistance to state and 
local police who handle most such violations. 
</P>
<P>
Making violent crime the sixth of the FBI's priorities also "will invigorate a 
program that has experienced an erosion of funding and manpower in recent 
years," Sessions said at a press conference. The FBI has jurisdiction over such 
violent crimes as kidnaping, extortion, bank robberies and hijackings and -- 
more recently -- drug-related homicides, police killings and the sexual 
exploitation of children. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, the FBI began establishing priorities that dictate to what 
cases the special agents in charge of its 57 field offices will assign their 
investigators. Those priorities have been foreign counterintelligence, 
organized crime, white collar crime, drugs and counterterrorism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violent Crimes Increasing 
</P>
<P>
"Additional responsibilities and an increasing violent crime rate have mandated 
a revitalization of our efforts," Sessions said. 
</P>
<P>
In the field, Sessions' move will mean that "no longer will an SAC (special 
agent in charge) take people from the squad working violent crime to do 
something else," said one official with experience in running a major field 
office. 
</P>
<P>
In supporting state and local law enforcement agencies, Sessions said that he 
wants to make greater use of such new tools as automated fingerprint systems, 
DNA genetic typing that can identify an individual from skin, blood and other 
body fluids at a crime scene, artificial intelligence and behavioral profiling 
to help identify suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Sessions noted that President Bush's crime package, sent to Congress last week, 
calls for an additional 300 FBI positions at a cost of $19.5 million to help 
combat violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confirms Gray Probe 
</P>
<P>
Responding to persistent questions at the press conference, Sessions also made 
clear for the first time that the Justice Department had authorized the 
bureau's investigation of suspected payroll padding in the office of Rep. 
William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), an inquiry that became public and threatened 
Gray's subsequent election as Democratic whip. 
</P>
<P>
In the investigation of Gray's office, Sessions said that the FBI had followed 
its "guidelines, procedures and policies." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman, detailing those policies, said that an investigation of a 
member of Congress can be initiated after consultation with the U.S. attorney 
for the area. FBI headquarters is notified immediately and it then advises the 
Justice Department's public integrity section "to further ensure adequate 
predication" for the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
On Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's complaint that he did not know in advance that 
two agents from the FBI's Philadelphia field office were going to interview 
Gray about the case on Memorial Day, Sessions said that he would not describe 
the failure to inform Thornburgh as "a breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
"There may have been a lapse, there may have been some circumstance where 
communication was not fully conveyed," Sessions said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Takes Unusual Step 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the House Democratic Caucus' vote, Thornburgh's executive 
assistant, Robert S. Ross, took the unusual step of announcing that Gray was 
"not a target of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is continuing, and Thornburgh has launched an investigation 
of its disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the handling of the Gray investigation indicated that politics 
was influencing federal investigations, Sessions -- his voice rising for 
emphasis -- responded with "an absolute resounding no. The bureau is and will 
be apolitical. It will not be involved in the pursuing of political objectives 
through investigation. That's absolutely critical." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh has said that he did not find anything improper in the 
investigation, only in its disclosure. On the subject of terrorism, Sessions 
indicated that he is more confident about identifying those responsible for the 
bombing of Pan American Flight 103 from London to New York last Dec. 21 than he 
is about solving the bombing in San Diego of the van driven by the wife of the 
skipper of the U.S. cruiser Vincennes. 
</P>
<P>
On the Vincennes inquiry, Sessions said that the dispatch of 15 agents to San 
Diego earlier this month did not signal that the investigation is stymied. But 
he added: "I can't express with strong confidence that we will solve that 
particular case, but I hope we are able to do it."

In an effort to save the candy-striped Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, which has 
guarded the treacherous coast known as the "graveyard of the Atlantic" for 119 
years, the National Park Service Wednesday proposed moving the lighthouse 
one-half mile inland. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the government acts, officials said, the North Carolina landmark, the 
tallest lighthouse in the country, will be washed into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service said the $8.7-million proposal to save the 2,800-ton, 208-foot 
lighthouse by jacking it up and moving it on rails appears to be the best of 
several proposals to preserve the historic tower. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to hold back the sea. . . . We had no choice but to retreat," 
said Orrin Pilkey, a Duke University geologist and a leading North Carolina 
environmentalist who is also an authority on beach erosion. 
</P>
<P>
When the lighthouse was opened in 1870, it was 1,500 feet from the ocean, but 
constant erosion of the Outer Banks has brought the sea within 200 feet of the 
lighthouse base. That threat has led to a prolonged and celebrated struggle 
among environmentalists, government officials and Outer Banks residents over 
how, or whether, to save the tower. 
</P>
<P>
Pilkey has contended that all efforts to stop beach erosion are futile. The 
latest proposal, subject to review by Park Service officials in Atlanta and 
congressional approval, was seen as a victory for environmental groups that 
persuaded the Park Service two years ago to reconsider its endorsement of a 
plan to build a sea wall around the lighthouse.

GOP IN HOUSE SEEKS PROBE OF ONE OF ITS OWN

House Republicans, seeking to defuse a political problem, took the 
unprecedented step Wednesday of triggering an investigation of one of their 
own: Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The action on Lukens, who was convicted last month on charges involving sex 
with a 16-year-old girl, came on a show of hands in a closed-door meeting of 
the Republican Conference, the organization of all GOP House members. 
</P>
<P>
Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said in a statement that the move was 
part of a Republican "total commitment to standards of behavior for members of 
Congress which reflect honorably on the institution and the nation." 
</P>
<P>
However, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said the Republicans seemed to 
be trying to score "a political point . . . apparently at the expense of one of 
their own members." He said any GOP attempt to make ethics a partisan issue was 
"absolute nonsense and the public knows it." 
</P>
<P>
The House Ethics Committee, formally the Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct, had been expected to investigate Lukens anyway. If the committee finds 
him to have violated House rules it could recommend penalties ranging from a 
reprimand to expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have set ethics reform in the House among their top priorities for 
the 101st Congress. And they hope to capitalize in the next elections by 
pointing to the resignations of Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California and 
the expected resignation of Jim Wright of Texas, who was House Speaker, in the 
face of ethics allegations. 
</P>
<P>
But Lukens' conviction on May 30 in Franklin County, Ohio, of contributing to 
the unruliness and delinquency of a minor, has been an embarrassment to his own 
party.

4 BLACKS WIN JUDGESHIPS IN COURT-ORDERED ELECTIONS

Four of eight black candidates have won judgeships in elections ordered by a 
federal judge who had ruled that Mississippi's judicial districts discriminated 
against blacks. Two of the winners were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi will now have five blacks among its 78 judges, a gain of one after 
Tuesday's elections. One incumbent was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The state's four black judges are Supreme Court Justice Reuben Anderson, 
Circuit Judges Fred L. Banks Jr. and Lillie Blackmon-Sanders and Chancery Judge 
Isaac Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
Each was appointed to fill a vacancy, but Anderson won a full eight-year term 
in 1986; he was not up for election Tuesday. Byrd did not seek election, Banks 
was unopposed and Blackmon-Sanders was challenged. 
</P>
<P>
With 98% of the vote in, unofficial returns showed Blackmon-Sanders losing to 
Republican challenger Richard Watson, 12,878 votes to 9,600. One other black 
Democrat, Isadore W. Patrick Vicksburg, was unopposed in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
The two black winners in contested races were Pat Wise, a Democrat, who 
defeated Republican Billy W. Keyes for an open Hinds County chancery judge's 
post, 5,942 votes to 1,638; and Denise Sweet Owens, also a Democrat, who 
defeated Republican George M. Arthur in an open family court post, 4,628 votes 
to 1,259. 
</P>
<P>
Black candidates Solomon Curtis Osborne, Clell G. Ward and Harold Brittain all 
lost to incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voting Rights Act Applied 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. ruled in 1987 that Mississippi's 
judicial districts discriminated against blacks. The ruling, the first to apply 
the 1965 Voting Rights Act to judicial elections, was upheld on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Barbour ordered some districts redrawn to create minority subdistricts so that 
black voters would have a better opportunity to elect black judges. 
</P>
<P>
Those judges elected Tuesday will take office on July 3. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippians also finally removed from the state Constitution an 
unenforceable poll tax that was enacted years ago to keep blacks from voting 
but was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial returns had 99,648 voting for repeal of the tax and 72,844 
against repeal.

7 IMPORTERS ACCUSED OF SELLING COUNTERFEIT GOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A team of U.S. Customs agents based in Kentucky swept into Los Angeles this 
week and arrested seven importers, including five Korean nationals, and seized 
thousands of allegedly counterfeit high-fashion handbags, watches and articles 
of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
According to arrest warrants made public Wednesday in U.S. District Court in 
Los Angeles, the seven arrested sold counterfeit merchandise bearing such names 
as Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Rolex to Customs agents in Kentucky, shipping the 
merchandise by United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials estimated that the merchandise, taken in the largest such 
seizure ever in the Los Angeles area, could have been sold for more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Customs Service said Wednesday that several truckloads of 
merchandise were seized by agents who served 10 search warrants Tuesday, 
primarily in the garment district of Los Angeles. Most of the merchandise 
appeared to have been imported from Korea, spokeswoman Maryanne Noonan said. 
</P>
<P>
Customs agents were cataloguing the merchandise at the Terminal Island federal 
prison Wednesday and are planning to hold a press conference on the seizure 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Six men and one woman arrested as part of the operation were charged Tuesday 
with conspiracy, smuggling and counterfeiting. All were arraigned Tuesday in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and released on $15,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan said the U.S. attorney's office is expected to prosecute the seven in 
Kentucky, where the six-month investigation was centered. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Heung Sik Nam, 35, of Los Angeles; Pong Chip Chon, 36, of Los 
Angeles; Won Kun Oh, 41, of Los Angeles; Kyu Sang Kim, 39, of Bellflower; Hak 
Bong Son, 39, of Los Angeles, and Chang Kwun Shin, 29, and his wife, Kwan Hee 
Shin, 31, both of Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Nam, Chon, Oh, Kim and Son are all Korean nationals, court records showed. 
</P>
<P>
The Shins, charged with conspiracy, smuggling and trafficking in counterfeit 
merchandise, could be sentenced to a maximum of 15 years in prison and fined 
$270,000 if convicted. Nam, Chon, Oh, Kim and Son were charged with smuggling 
and trafficking and could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 
$260,000. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan said the investigation, called Operation Tradesman, began in Cincinnati 
after counterfeit merchandise began showing up in Midwest markets. 
</P>
<P>
According to affidavits filed with the arrest warrants, customs agents found 
the name Chang Kwun Shin and a telephone number for Slauson Total Fashion with 
several hundred pieces of counterfeit merchandise seized Jan. 10 at a retail 
outlet in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
An agent called the number early in February and ordered merchandise. Later, 38 
Gucci and Louis Vuitton bags arrived in Kentucky, C.O.D. 
</P>
<P>
When the agent phoned again in May, Kwan Hee Shin bragged over the phone that 
"she was the largest distributor of counterfeit goods in Los Angeles and that 
she supplied all of the smaller retailers in the area and many out of state," 
the warrant said. She told the agent she had a warehouse full of Louis Vuitton 
merchandise and offered discounts for orders of more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, agents came to Los Angeles in March for meetings with the five 
others, believed to be part of a second smuggling operation that operated on a 
similar basis. In those meetings and with follow-up telephone orders in April, 
they made purchases that included 78 MCM handbags for $1,154 and 30 Rolex 
watches for $750. In all, more than 300 items were shipped to several Kentucky 
cities.

FORMER UC MEDICAL SCHOOL DEAN NAMED TO LEAD AMA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. C. John Tupper, founding dean of the UC Davis School of Medicine, was named 
president-elect of the American Medical Assn. on Wednesday at the 
organization's summer meeting in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Tupper, the fourth Californian named to the position in this century, will 
assume the presidency in one year. His first goal is the strengthening of 
national health care by focusing on regional service, Tupper said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are mounting a large effort to make good health care available to all 
American citizens (and) we're helping those efforts by having very strong 
component societies, both state and county," he said in a telephone interview. 
Tupper, 69, pointed to the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., the largest such 
organization in the nation, as an example of an effective component society. 
</P>
<P>
His election to the executive position of the 290,000-member association 
highlights a career that has seen both generous accolades and notable 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Respected Institution 
</P>
<P>
As dean of the UC Davis School of Medicine from its inception in 1966 until 
1980, Tupper was largely credited with developing the school into a respected 
medical institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was here in terms of a medical school until he arrived," said Davis 
spokesman Don Martensen. "He began the process of recruiting the faculty of the 
medical school." 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure as dean, however, Tupper came under fire for favoring some 
applicants who otherwise did not meet the academic requirements for admission, 
critics charged. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1976 Times article, Tupper defended his actions, saying that in most cases 
he interceded to ensure the fairness of the admissions process. He conceded, 
however, that in some instances he intervened to help "special interest 
people," whom he defined as those whose names he recognized, for example, the 
son or daughter of a colleague. 
</P>
<P>
While Tupper at the time described his actions as "good public relations," the 
University of California Board of Regents revised Davis' admissions process to 
ensure a more uniform system. 
</P>
<P>
Tupper again came under media attention in 1974, when Allan Bakke, a 
34-year-old white engineer, filed suit against the University of California 
claiming that he had been denied admission to the Davis School of Medicine 
while less qualified minority applicants were accepted under a special minority 
admissions program. Bakke's case eventually went to the California Supreme 
Court, which ruled in his favor, and Tupper was forced to accept Bakke's 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
Tupper stepped down as dean of the Davis medical school in 1979, when he 
assumed the presidency of the California Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Tupper has held numerous positions within the AMA, including that of delegate, 
member of the Board of Trustees and founding chairman of the Council on 
Scientific Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
He said his new office of president-elect is not one that can single-handedly 
set organizational policy or dictate action, and he added that he will rely on 
the group's more than 300 national delegates and its Board of Trustees for 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
"The AMA is a democracy, not an autocracy," he said. "Nobody gives orders 
around here -- it's not run from the top down." 
</P>
<P>
Said California Medical Assn. spokesman Chuck McFadden on Tupper's election: 
"He is living proof that nice guys sometimes do finish first."

MAN CONVICTED OF THROAT-SLASH MURDERS OF TWO WOMEN, BOY, 3

<P>
After eight days of deliberations, a jury convicted a suburban carpet cleaner 
Wednesday of the throat-slash murders of three people and the attempted murder 
of another. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of six men and six women who convicted David Lucas, 33, of Spring 
Valley found that the murders were committed with special circumstance, which 
could mean the death sentence. The jurors will return to deliberate on the 
sentence next month. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, originally accused of a string of six murders in the San Diego area, sat 
impassively as the verdicts were announced. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1979 deaths of Suzanne 
Jacobs, 31; her son, Colin, 3, and the 1984 death of Anne Catherine Swanke, 22. 
Jacobs and her son were found with their throats slashed inside their San Diego 
home. Swanke, a San Diego State student, was found with her throat slashed on a 
remote hillside in Spring Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also convicted Lucas of the attempted murder of Jody Santiago 
Robertson. Robertson, a Seattle woman, survived a June 9, 1984, attack in which 
she was strangled and her throat slashed. Lucas was also convicted of kidnaping 
Robertson, who testified for the prosecution, and Swanke.

Lucas was acquitted in the death of Gayle Roberta Garcia, a Point Loma realtor 
who was found with her throat slashed in a vacant Spring Valley house Dec. 8, 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors were deadlocked on charges that Lucas killed Rhonda Strang, 24, and 
Amber Fisher, 3, both of Lakeside. Strang was baby-sitting the child when their 
throats were slashed Oct. 23, 1984. The jury foreman told Superior Court Judge 
Laura Hammes that after taking four or five votes, jurors were split, 11 for 
conviction and one for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas had served a four-year sentence at the California Youth Authority for the 
1973 rape of a young woman. The woman was abducted and taken to a remote 
recreation area where, authorities said, Lucas raped her and used a knife to 
cut her hands and throat. She survived the attack.

The editor of an Afrikaans language newspapar was given a suspended jail term 
Wednesday for printing the opinions of a leading figure in the outlawed African 
National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The court convicted Max du Preez, 37, editor of Vrye Weekblad (Free Weekly), 
under the Internal Security Act for publishing comments by Joe Slovo, general 
secretary of the South African Communist Party and executive member of the ANC.

Slovo is a "listed" person who may not be legally quoted in the South African 
press. Du Preez received a six-month suspended sentence, and his newspaper was 
fined $360, also suspended, by the magistrate court judge in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The charge arose from the reporting of a meeting in West Germany between the 
ANC and leading South African liberals, including several Afrikaners, the 
Dutch-descended people who make up the majority of South Africa's white 
population.

CHAMBER REPAYS HOLLYWOOD SIGN FUND $46,500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has restored $46,529 to a trust fund set up 
to maintain the landmark Hollywood sign, acknowledging that the money was used 
improperly to cover the chamber's own operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened should not have happened, and by taking this action we hope to 
wipe the slate clean," said Larry Kaplan, the chamber's president and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kaplan said the chamber's executive board had not decided whether to 
repay an estimated $45,000 in interest forfeited by the Hollywood Sign Trust 
during the 10 years that money from the trust was on loan to the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something we're having our lawyers and accountants look into, and we 
don't expect to reach a final decision on that for another couple of weeks," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said the chamber borrowed $53,158 from the trust fund in 1979 and 
1981, Kaplan said the $46,529 repayment, made last Friday, "reflects the fact 
that the trust also owed the chamber some money." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, community activists critical of the chamber's handling of the 
transaction called for the interest to be repaid immediately, and said they 
intend to ask the state attorney general's office to conduct an audit of the 
chamber's finances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Find It Unbelievable' 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked to read they had used the money from the trust for their own 
purposes, and I find it unbelievable that they would now hesitate to repay the 
interest," said Ed Cohan, a lawyer representing three homeowner groups at odds 
with the chamber over the sign. "I'd like to know who else can borrow money 
interest-free." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, The Times disclosed that of $122,166 in assets reported by chamber 
officials last year as belonging to the trust fund, $53,158 had been on loan to 
the chamber for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
The famous sign atop Mt. Lee in Griffith Park is under the jurisdiction of the 
Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. But by agreement with the city, 
the chamber has been responsible for its upkeep since 1978, after raising 
nearly $300,000 to save it from demolition. 
</P>
<P>
The trust fund was established in 1978 as part of the fund-raising effort. 
About $214,000 of the almost $300,000 placed in the fund was spent that year to 
rebuild the sign. The rest was to be held in the trust fund to maintain the 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the trust's tax-exempt status, chamber officials agreed that the 
funds were to be used exclusively for the maintenance of the sign, and that the 
trust was "not to be affiliated with or controlled by the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce or any other organization." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees Outstrip Expenditures 
</P>
<P>
However, federal and state records showed that as of the most recent filing 
period, ending last June, the trust had spent only about $600 for maintenance 
of the sign since the fund was created, and more than $3,300 on bank and 
accounting fees. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the latest developments, a Recreation and Parks official said 
this week his agency may want to "take another look" at its informal 
arrangement with the chamber over the sign's management. 
</P>
<P>
"From what's happened, I think a better form of documentation is needed," said 
Assistant General Manager Sheldon Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have now should probably be replaced with a binding agreement that 
clearly spells out what our responsibilities are, what theirs are, where the 
revenues come from, where they go and who authorizes them, those kinds of 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the chamber's executive board told The Times last month that 
the money borrowed by the chamber was used to cover the chamber's operating 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, the chamber's Kaplan confirmed that the money had 
been used for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lean Times' Blamed 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dynamic, growing organization, but it hasn't always been that way. 
There have been some lean times, and the money was apparently used to get the 
chamber through some of those lean times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he was "not going to apologize for things that happened in the past," 
Kaplan -- a former chief of staff to City Councilman Michael Woo who replaced 
Bill Welsh as head of the chamber last month -- insisted there was "nothing 
sinister" about the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of malfeasance on anyone's part. It's more a case of 
admittedly, to some extent, sloppy practices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal tax records indicated that the trust fund loaned $53,158 to 
the chamber in 1984, an accountant for the chamber said that the money was 
actually borrowed in two increments several years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Accountant Randy Weaver said the chamber borrowed more than $38,000 from the 
fund in 1979, and another $15,000 in 1981. Weaver said the terms of the first 
loan were unclear, but that the chamber agreed to pay the trust fund 10% 
interest on the 1981 loan. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kaplan said the interest on both loans amounts to "more than $45,000," 
the chairman of the chamber's executive board, Don Tillman, said he was unsure 
about the amount and that officials were "investigating as to what the interest 
rate is going to be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Commitment 
</P>
<P>
But both men were careful to say that the chamber had not committed itself to 
repaying interest, regardless of the amount. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, who have for months pressed the chamber to disclose its financial 
dealings involving the sign, quickly expressed displeasure over the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make the chamber look very good," said Bob Higgins, vice president 
of the Whitley Heights Assn. "They've been caught with their hand in the piggy 
bank and they're sort of saying, like a child, 'I didn't mean to and I'll put 
the money back.' But in the meantime they've profited enormously off that 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Christine O'Brien, president of Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn., said she plans 
to ask the state to conduct an audit of the chamber's finances "so that maybe, 
finally, we can get some straight answers. We've had nothing but resistance in 
our efforts to find out about (the sign's finances)." 
</P>
<P>
Her group and two others have joined with communities in 11 states to oppose 
the chamber's bid before the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office to gain 
exclusive use of the word Hollywood for commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built in 1920 
</P>
<P>
The sign, built in the 1920s, originally spelled out "Hollywoodland," the name 
of the real estate subdivision it was built to promote. Originally illuminated 
by 4,000 20-watt bulbs, the often-vandalized sign has long been a sore spot 
with residents in the nearby Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
For years, they have complained of their neighborhoods being under assault from 
trespassers, loiterers and vandals drawn to the sign. 
</P>
<P>
Residents were upset last year after the chamber announced a proposal to 
permanently light the sign with the help of a solar energy company. The 
proposal was dropped after widespread public opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of the ill-wind being generated toward the chamber and its 
handling of the trust fund stems from past disagreement over the sign, no 
question about it," Kaplan said. "I want to put all that behind us and look to 
the future."

SUBSCRIBERS VIEW BETTER CABLE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The picture for cable television service on the Westside -- which has been 
notorious for its disruptions, poor customer relations and outdated equipment 
-- is getting brighter. 
</P>
<P>
The Westside's two primary cable operators -- Century Cable in the north and 
American Cablesystems in the south -- are spending millions of dollars to 
upgrade their systems. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon Cable, which provides service in Malibu and Topanga and a small corner 
of Pacific Palisades, has also upgraded its system recently. 
</P>
<P>
Industry spokesmen say this means customers' telephone calls will be answered 
quicker, home service calls will be made more promptly and subscribers will get 
more viewing choices. 
</P>
<P>
That's good news for subscribers of Century Cable, which has been heavily 
criticized by both subscribers and city officials throughout the Westside ever 
since the company took over cable franchises in 1987 in Santa Monica, Beverly 
Hills, West Hollywood and parts of Los Angeles from Pacific Palisades to the 
Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Century Southwest Cable Television, a subsidiary of Century Communications 
Corp. in New Canaan, Conn., took over the Westside cable systems as part of a 
five-company consortium that bought Group W Cable for $2.1 billion from 
Westinghouse Electric Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Century is in the second year of a six-year, $50-million program to upgrade the 
systems. Although the improvements will not be completed until 1993, the number 
of complaints is dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
"Their problems relative to customer service and technical service have reduced 
greatly," said Ian Tanza, West Hollywood's cable/arts administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"Complaints are way down," said Fred Cunningham, who oversees cable matters for 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been happier than I am today," said William J. Rosendahl, vice 
president of corporate affairs for Century. 
</P>
<P>
Century has been a repeated target of vandals who have damaged equipment or 
disrupted signals -- often during broadcasts of major sports or entertainment 
events. Until recently, service was so bad that it was widely believed the 
vandals were disgruntled customers, but Rosendahl said he is convinced that 
could not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe someone would commit a criminal act over poor service," he 
said. "It must be some sick, deranged individual." 
</P>
<P>
Rosendahl blames many of the company's problems on the antiquated equipment it 
inherited. The technology was so outdated that customers could easily steal the 
service by illegally connecting to cable lines on telephone poles with coaxial 
cables sold at hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
Modernization of the system makes the signals difficult to steal. Some former 
pirates complained to Century when they could no longer get cable service free, 
Rosendahl said. 
</P>
<P>
Century also drew many complaints when it attempted to serve more than 76,000 
Westside customers from a single office in Santa Monica. Last November, Century 
opened a second office in West Hollywood to serve that city and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still far from perfect, but their service has improved dramatically," 
said West Hollywood Councilman Paul Koretz, an outspoken critic of Century. "It 
used to be that people would wait 45 minutes on hold, then when someone picked 
up, you were disconnected." 
</P>
<P>
To most subscribers, the most noticeable modernization involves the 
installation of converter boxes in the homes of subscribers. The new 
converters, an option available at extra cost, allow Century to offer 
pay-per-view events such as championship fights and recently released movies. 
</P>
<P>
Basic service -- which usually includes all channels that can be received with 
a regular television antenna plus cable channels such as ESPN, MTV, CNN and 
WTBS -- can be received without a converter box. 
</P>
<P>
Century has completed its converter-box installations in West Hollywood, but 
installations are in progress in Beverly Hills and much of West Los Angeles and 
have yet to begin in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been a trouble-free process.. Many Century customers in West 
Hollywood complained because the boxes disable remote controls on televisions 
and videotape recorders, and prevent viewers from watching one channel while 
recording another. 
</P>
<P>
Those problems have been remedied, Rosendahl said, by providing customers with 
remote controls for the boxes and installing switches that make it possible to 
view one channel and record off another. 
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, Century was fined a total of $29,250 last year -- $250 a day 
for 117 days in which it did not respond to service calls or promptly answer 
the telephone as required by the franchise agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Fred Cunningham, who oversees the franchise for the city, said there has 
been a definite improvement in service. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been meeting customer service requirements of responding to calls 
within 24 hours and answering the phone within two minutes," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said that Century learned a lesson from its West Hollywood 
experience and has begun a public relations program to prepare subscribers for 
the installation of the new coverter boxes in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, Century is continuing negotiations to extend its franchise. 
Technically, the company is operating under a revocation order issued in 1986, 
when the city refused to allow the transfer of the franchise from Westinghouse 
to Century. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne C. Barrette, the assistant city manager who oversees cable operations in 
Santa Monica, said the city attorney is rewriting the city's cable ordinance. 
She said she expects the City Council to review both the new ordinance and 
Century's request for an extension in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles areas served by Century -- Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, 
Westwood, Bel-Air and the Hollywood Hills -- Susan Herman, who oversees cable 
franchises for the city, is not yet ready to praise the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Pleased is too strong a word," Herman said. "We have concerns about 
responsiveness to customers." 
</P>
<P>
However, she added, "they have increased the number of telephone lines so 
people don't have to wait as long. They have more service representatives, 
extended their hours of operation and expanded the existing number of channels. 
They appear to be in compliance with the franchise agreement. They are making 
efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Herman was more generous in assessing American Cablesystems franchises in 
Venice, West Los Angeles, Westchester and Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty well-managed system," she said. "The performance of American is 
very much improved from CommuniCom," the former cable operator in West Los 
Angeles, which was widely criticized for its service. 
</P>
<P>
American Cablesystems, which also operates the system in Culver City and the 
unincorporated county areas of Ladera Heights and View Park, will be renamed 
Continental Cablevision on July 1. Boston-based Continental Cable, the 
third-largest cable system in the country, purchased the Westside systems in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Gibbs, Continental's vice president for corporate and legal affairs, 
said the company recently spent $30 million to upgrade its systems in the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said that while the company purchased cable systems that were near each 
other, the systems have been decentralized. 
</P>
<P>
"We have clustered systems together, but we maintain local, almost neighborhood 
autonomy," said Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Jones, chief administrative officer for Culver City, said complaints have 
dropped to about one a month. James Thornton, who oversees cable for the 
county, said complaints are almost nonexistent for his areas. 
</P>
<P>
A major complaint of many cable subscribers in all areas, however, is the 
increasing cost of cable, a matter over which local officials have no control. 
</P>
<P>
Studies indicate that cable rates have increased 32% nationally since Congress 
lifted virtually all regulations on cable operators in 1984. Herman said rates 
for basic service in the city of Los Angeles have increased 40% since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights, has introduced bills 
that would allow city governments to regulate rates, require that cable 
programmers make their programs available to competing technologies such as 
satellites and prohibit a cable company from controlling more than 25% of the 
cable subscribers in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Commerce 
Committee, called for the Federal Communications Commission to review the Cable 
Communications Policy Act of 1984, which deregulated the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell said he wants to determine whether unregulated competition, which was 
supposed to protect the public interest, is in fact protecting consumers.

CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO ALLOW DEVELOPER TO CUT RIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling it one of the most difficult decisions of their political careers, 
members of the Glendale City Council on Tuesday voted 3 to 2 to permit a 
developer to scrape off the top of a prominent ridge in order to fill in a hole 
and complete a controversial subdivision in the Verdugo Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The action gives Gregg-Gangi Development Co. of Glendale permission to cut up 
to 70 feet from a ridge to obtain a quarter-million cubic yards of earth needed 
to complete the Oakmont View subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
The grading project will avoid the only alternative seriously considered by the 
council -- trucking in the dirt needed to fill the hole, which would have 
disrupted the quiet hillside neighborhood of expensive homes for at least 1 1/2 
years, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that I have ever agonized over a decision as much as I have 
agonized over this one," said Councilman Larry Zarian, who was the first to 
announce Tuesday that he would vote for cutting the ridgeline rather than 
trucking in dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Ginger Bremberg and Dick Jutras also voted to approve the 
grading project. All three said they support the city's stringent ridgeline 
protection laws but that the grading project -- which affects a secondary 
ridge, rather than a primary ridge -- is more acceptable than trucking in dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jerold Milner and Councilman Carl Raggio dissented. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gone far enough in cutting ridges and destroying natural ridgelines," 
Milner said. "That is something I do not wish to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Creating a Problem' 
</P>
<P>
Raggio said grading the hillside is "creating a problem to solve a problem." He 
predicted that the scars will be visible for 10 years as "a reminder to me that 
that was not the thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
The vote ended more than a year of debate among council members on how best to 
resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the developers miscalculated how much dirt they needed to 
complete the 197-lot subdivision of exclusive view homes above the Oakmont 
Country Club. The project, approved in 1976, lacks about 25,000 truckloads of 
dirt needed to fill in a six-acre hole to create the final 25 lots, worth at 
least $5 million, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since it discovered the shortage in 1986, Gregg-Gangi has proposed to cut 
down a ridge that separates the Oakmont View and Oakmont Woods subdivisions in 
the Verdugo-Woodlands area. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have warned that the grading project will create "a highly 
visible scar" that will be seen from La Crescenta Valley and Verdugo Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents protested after they learned about the developer's plans 
last year. In the wake of the outcry, the council in July ordered the city 
engineer to withhold a grading permit for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The developers, in turn, threatened to sue the city, charging that the city was 
unfairly holding up the project even though the developers had complied with 
all the city's laws and ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
The original project required the developers to obtain all of the dirt they 
needed from within the 65-acre subdivision. The developers blamed the shortage 
of dirt, in part, on a county requirement that they build two flood control 
channels in an earlier subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners, however, have accused Gregg-Gangi of deliberately planning the 
shortage of dirt. The grading project approved this week will open a roadway to 
91 acres owned by the developers on the north side of the ridge. 
</P>
<P>
"The developer in this case is not an amateur," said homeowner Al Hoffman. "No 
one but a rank amateur would have wound up with a hole in the ground like this 
one." He called the hillside grading proposal "part of a deliberate plan" to 
open the Verdugo Mountains to further development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trucking in Dirt Opposed 
</P>
<P>
After the two-hour session Tuesday, however, the majority of council members 
said they prefer grading the ridge to trucking in dirt. 
</P>
<P>
The grading project will require the developers to contour the ridge and 
landscape it to resemble a natural hillside. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, homes on the last 25 lots are to be built by Gregg-Gangi and their 
architectural design approved by a city review board. 
</P>
<P>
Developers John L. Gregg and Salvatore F. Gangi declined to comment Tuesday on 
how soon they expect the grading project to get under way.

Photo, Studio Drive-In's Ultimate Feature Is Its Own Demise Culver City's 
Studio Drive-In is one of 25 left in Southern California. But rising land 
values are forcing it to shut down. On a recent weekend evening, about 500 cars 
pulled into the 11-acre drive-in, which used to attract as many as 1,000 cars a 
night, said manager Jose Mendoza. Culver City's redevelopment agency plans to 
buy the drive-in at Jefferson and Sepulveda boulevards. Some of the land will 
be used to realign the Y-shaped intersection, but most of it will be sold to a 
private developer to build housing. So the Los Angeles Conservancy, which does 
not oppose the sale, has started to say goodby to the landmark. Conservancy 
members Michael Marr and Vivian Curtis participated in a 1950s-style salute to 
the drive-in Wednesday, hula hooping near a display that included a 1955 
Cadillac Fleetwood, 1957 Lincoln Premiere and 1961 Chrysler Newport. A 
Conservancy-sponsored benefit at the drive-in Aug. 23 will feature "The Girl 
Can't Help It," starring Tom Ewell, Jayne Mansfield and Edmond O'Brien. "It's a 
sort of fond farewell," Greg Davidson, an official of the preservationist 
group, said. "We want people who reminisce about the '50s to relive those days 
again at the Studio Drive-In, a Westside favorite since 1948." CASSY COHEN /

SLOW-TO-SELL RANCH OWNERS COULD GET TAX BONANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The public reluctance by the owners of Taylor Ranch to sell 465 acres for a new 
California State University campus may eventually help them obtain a tax 
bonanza of more than $2 million, a survey of legal experts revealed this week. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually assured of the tax windfall, owners of the ranch broke a yearlong 
silence this week, disclosing that they are actively negotiating the sale of 
their land while fighting to retain some oil-drilling rights. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by Cal State's clear determination to use eminent domain powers to 
seize the ranch for a campus site, a lawyer representing the Taylor Ranch 
owners said they are now trying to work out "the best deal possible" with the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer a question of whether we are willing to sell," said Santa 
Barbara attorney James Hurley, representing Taylor Ranch heiress Cynthia Wood 
and other family members. "The state has made it clear they plan to take the 
property. In that case, you then try to negotiate or make the best deal you can 
for the rest of the ranch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Primary Concerns 
</P>
<P>
In negotiations with the state, Hurley said, the primary concerns will be in 
securing oil-drilling rights on the land, adequate water supplies for the rest 
of the ranch, a satisfactory price and environmental safeguards involving the 
proximity of oil-drilling operations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tax advantages of having opposed a project headed for condemnation, 
Hurley said the potential tax benefits were never a consideration in opposing 
the campus site. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," Hurley said. "Our opposition from the start has been made 
primarily because of environmental concerns." 
</P>
<P>
While Hurley denied that a tax break was one of the motives for opposing the 
Cal State campus site, several leading California lawyers told The Times that 
one benefit of the opposition will be a considerable windfall for Taylor 
Ranch's owners. 
</P>
<P>
When a state agency moves to acquire private property for public use, they 
pointed out, the owners must resist the initial purchase offer to qualify for 
tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman, one of the leading tax lawyers on the 
West Coast, said that if the owners of Taylor Ranch had immediately accepted a 
state offer to purchase their land, they would have lost a chance for lucrative 
state and federal tax deferments. 
</P>
<P>
Hochman said that if the state pays $7 million for the land, the sum earmarked 
for the purchase of the hillside parcel, the owners would have two years to 
reinvest tax-free profits in similar property and would never have to pay 
capital gains taxes on the profits if they did not resell the new holdings 
during their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Savings 
</P>
<P>
The savings in state and federal capital gains taxes would be $2 million at 
that $7-million purchase price if the land had originally cost $1 million, 
Hochman said. Assuming that the initial land costs were significantly less, he 
said, the savings would be even greater. 
</P>
<P>
The legal insights into the high-stakes tax maneuvers that accompany almost all 
major state land acquisitions followed a week of major new developments in Cal 
State's continuing quest to acquire the Taylor Ranch site: 
</P>
<P>
* After a unanimous vote by the Ventura City Council rezoning the hillside 
parcel for institutional use and encouraging Cal State to proceed with the 
project, the university took the first step toward seizing the land by 
obtaining authorization of the California Public Works Board for eminent domain 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
* At the same time, state officials disclosed that constructive negotiations 
are in progress that could eliminate the need for eminent domain proceedings 
and produce a settlement in the next few months. Hurley's confirmation 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
* As Cal State moved closer to acquiring the ranch site, environmental forces 
opposed to converting the parcel into a bustling state university site filed a 
lawsuit seeking to block the purchase, pending revisions in an environmental 
impact report approved by the state last month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Months of Speculation 
</P>
<P>
The latest flurry of activity and the outside legal assessments of the 
economics involved in eminent domain cases came after months of speculation 
over why the ranch's owners apparently were determined to resist potential 
legal action that almost always results in a successful state seizure. 
</P>
<P>
The Taylor Ranch owners, Wood and her mother and stepfather, Pierre and Ailene 
Claeyssens, all of Montecito, have been on record as opposing the sale of the 
ranch since June, 1988, although Ventura officials have said Wood initially had 
a favorable attitude about selling the property for a university. The family 
has owned the ranch since the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the family's opposition to selling the land, Wood's attorney, J. 
Robert Andrews of Santa Barbara, initially cited alleged concerns by Shell Oil 
Co., which has oil leases on the ranch, that the presence of a campus could 
disrupt oil production and create potential liability problems. Shell 
officials, however, denied any opposition to a proposed campus. 
</P>
<P>
Wood's stepfather, Pierre Claeyssens, cited another possible factor in the 
family's opposition in revealing last year that his wife had not known of the 
plans before her daughter told her of the proposal and was angry that she had 
been kept in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Public Effort 
</P>
<P>
Apart from those explanations, however, Wood and the Claeyssens had made no 
public effort to clarify their position in the last year until Hurley's 
comments this week. 
</P>
<P>
During recent Ventura City Council hearings on the city's future, several 
environmental groups cited the family's opposition to a Cal State campus, but 
the actual owners of Taylor Ranch did not speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The tax and land acquisition specialists interviewed this week were careful not 
to speculate about possible motives behind the owners' public opposition to the 
sale, but they did say that such opposition is virtually required as a legal 
posture in other cases to assure landowners the best possible tax advantages. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to fight it all the way to court," said Los Angeles attorney 
Hodge Dolle Sr., a specialist in eminent domain proceedings. "But to qualify 
with the Internal Revenue Service and the State Franchise Board for capital 
gains deferral, the sale has to have been in lieu of condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Smart Property Owner' 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, there's obviously a big piece of change involved," he added. "I 
would say that's a smart property owner to oppose the sale." 
</P>
<P>
Both Dolle and Loyola University Law School Professor Gideon Kanner, a leading 
expert on eminent domain who publishes a monthly periodical titled Just 
Compensation, agreed that barring some unforeseen environmental issue there is 
little chance that the owners of Taylor Ranch could prevail in any court battle 
against Cal State to block condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
"The taking must be for a public use and a university campus is clearly a 
public use," Kanner said. "The bottom line is sure, they can get it. It's a 
fairly common argument for the owner to say, 'Why me? Take somebody else's 
land.' But that doesn't go over very often. In a case like this, there's not 
much to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Kanner stressed that he sees nothing conspiratorial in the objections voiced by 
the owners of Taylor Ranch to selling their land, saying that it is normal for 
landowners to oppose such acquisition until the time when they realize that it 
is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the Taylor Ranch sitting up there and one day the government comes 
knocking at the door and says we want your ranch," Kanner said. "They say no. 
That's a perfectly normal response. Then, maybe later, they come to understand 
that there's really not much they can do to stop it. Any agreement at this 
point is in lieu of condemnation, and the owners are entitled to the tax 
deferments that come with such involuntary sales." 
</P>
<P>
While state officials stopped short this week of saying that they believe the 
action of the Public Works Board should satisfy any legal concerns the owners 
may have about the certainty of receiving full tax breaks at this stage of the 
acquisition process, they called it proof of the state's determination to 
acquire the land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Hoping 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say we continue to be hopeful," said Jack Smart, Cal State's vice 
chancellor for university affairs. "We are in constructive discussions with the 
owners of the property. Assuming successful negotiations, I hope we can 
complete discussions by the end of the summer and avoid any further eminent 
domain proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
Smart had no comment on the lawsuit filed against the Cal State Board of 
Trustees in an effort to block further acquisition activities by the state 
pending submission of a revamped environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
That suit, filed by the Environmental Coalition on grounds that the initial 
environmental impact report is incomplete, charges that Cal State only studied 
the potential impact of a two-year campus with 2,000 students, although the 
university could ultimately grow to a four-year school with 12,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, prepared by attorney Philip A. Seymour of the Environmental Defense 
Center of Santa Barbara, also charges that state officials did not give critics 
adequate time to provide input on key environmental issues, including possible 
damage to archeological sites and possible paleontological deposits in the 
hillside area.

FASHION PLAZA EXPANSION STARTS GAINING GROUND

Saying a controversial $117-million shopping center expansion is vital to this 
city's financial well-being, Mayor Robert L. Bacon predicted Wednesday that the 
work will proceed now that a pivotal city councilman has given his support. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference to rally support for the expansion of Fashion Plaza, 
Bacon said: "My belief is that this project will be approved" at a joint City 
Council-Redevelopment Agency meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bacon said one of two councilmen previously opposed to the expansion plan, 
Bradley J. McFadden, now favors the deal after extracting further financial 
concessions from the developers, mall owner Sylvan S. Shulman and developer May 
Centers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
McFadden, asserting that the recently modified deal was probably the best the 
city could expect, acknowledged that he conditionally favors the expansion. In 
an interview, McFadden said he still wants assurances from May Centers that it 
will not abandon the city's other shopping mall, Eastland Shopping Center, 
which the developer owns. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency and May Centers this week are negotiating a separate 
revitalization agreement for Eastland that also will be presented Monday. 
McFadden said that the company has agreed to $3.5 million in improvements of 
the mall's exterior and that tax revenues will not drop. 
</P>
<P>
The developers have also guaranteed that the city will receive $2.2 million 
dollars over the next 10 years in addition to its portion of the tax revenues 
generated by the Fashion Plaza expansion. The developers had originally offered 
$1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes favorably between now and Monday and if we come to a 
suitable compromise (on Eastland) . . . I will be more in favor," McFadden 
said, referring to the Fashion Plaza proposal. "If we don't approve (the 
agreement), even with the terms being offered, what will happen is there will 
be a dilapidated Eastland and an old Fashion Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's clear that we'll be better off with it than without it." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, May Centers officials said they were reconsidering their 
participation because of the apparent 3-2 split on the City Council over the 
terms of Fashion Plaza's expansion. The proposal calls for the city to buy and 
clear developed land near the Fashion Plaza for the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
If the current owners are not willing to sell, the agency might have to condemn 
the land. Condemnation proceedings by the agency board, made up of the five 
council members, requires four votes. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, McFadden and Councilman William Tarozzi had expressed 
reservations over the city's financial role in the project. Tarozzi has said 
the city is giving away too much in anticipated tax revenues pledged to the 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the agency gave preliminary approval to the plan, instructing its 
staff to negotiate a development agreement with the Shulman-May Centers 
partnership. May Centers is a subsidiary of St. Louis-based May Department 
Stores. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for Fashion Plaza calls for adding a 140,000-square-foot May Co. 
store, 100,000 square feet of new mall space and up to 82,000 square feet of 
small shops near the plaza. The plaza now has 1 million square feet. The May 
Co. store in the Eastland mall would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the existing mall would be rehabilitated, including adding a 
restaurant area and skylights and upgrading the entrance and interior. The 
proposal calls for the city's acquiring -- possibly through condemnation -- 26 
acres of existing developed land east of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence M. Costello, May Centers associate development director, said the 
company views the fourth vote as crucial. "If we don't get the four votes 
needed, we will have to sit down with our partners and possibly reconsider," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the proposed agreement, the city would rebate to the 
developers up to $100 million in anticipated revenues over the 30-year life of 
the agreement. Most of that would go to pay off the construction bonds, 
redevelopment officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for the city to give up all the new property tax revenues 
created for 30 years. For the first 15 years, the city would give up 85% of the 
new sales taxes created by the expansion, and 70% of it in the following 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"These payments will come solely from additional tax revenues that we don't 
have today," Bacon said, adding that the city will net $35 million in new sales 
and property taxes over the life of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The mall now generates an estimated $1.2 million annually in sales tax, which 
the city would retain. That is 15% of the city's annual sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The agency would issue $42 million in tax-exempt bonds to acquire and clear 
land, relocate existing businesses and install public improvements. The 
developers would have to pay off the bonds, which would be secured by the mall 
property. The city will maintain ownership of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Shulman-May Centers will pay the city about $7 million for the property in the 
expansion area. The developers are responsible for the $40-million mall 
expansion, the addition of small shops near the plaza and new retail space, the 
$17.5-million renovation of the existing mall, and the $13-million construction 
of the new May Co. store. 
</P>
<P>
The revitalization is intended to transform the 14-year-old center into a 
"super regional mall" better able to compete with the Puente Hills Mall, Santa 
Anita Fashion Park in Arcadia, and the Montclair Plaza, which has four major 
department stores. The mall has a Broadway, J. C. Penney and a Bullock's 
department store. The mall "is perceived as a mediocre center" by today's 
standards, Costello said. 
</P>
<P>
According to city studies, the Fashion Plaza has experienced a 7% decline in 
sales and a 19% drop in foot traffic from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Wong, president of the Chamber of Commerce, and Gary Enderle, president of 
the Fashion Plaza Merchants Assn., said the expansion is vital to the mall's 
survival, and chided critics for not being realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that those individuals who are opposed to the deal have simply not 
looked at the facts or do not understand them," Wong said.

EFFORT TO BALANCE BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
COMPTON REPORTED READY TO LAY OFF 80 
</P>

<P>
City officials are expected to send out layoff notices to about 80 employees 
this week as part of an effort to balance the budget for the new fiscal year, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the layoffs, which would represent about 10% of the city's work 
force, the new budget still has a $6-million shortfall that may require 
additional payroll cuts, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials did not discuss the layoff plans Tuesday night at a public 
hearing on the budget, despite repeated inquiries from residents. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Caldwell, acting city manager, told residents that he would propose a 
balanced budget. When one resident asked whether there would be layoffs, 
Caldwell said he had not completed budget revisions, but that he would do 
whatever is necessary, including laying off employees, to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
However, a source said the layoff plans were disclosed earlier Tuesday at a 
closed-door meeting of Caldwell, City Controller Timothy Brown and council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell and Brown painted a grim financial picture during the closed meeting, 
the source said. Even with the layoffs, the source said, the city is still $6 
million short of balancing its 1989-90 budget, which the council must have in 
place by the start of the fiscal year on July 1. Part of the problem, the 
source said, is that this year's budget contains a $3-million deficit that must 
be made up next year. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell told department heads Wednesday morning that he or his assistants 
would begin meeting with them individually to disclose which positions must be 
cut. Two department heads confirmed that Caldwell painted a "bleak" picture of 
the city's budget situation during the morning meeting, but said Caldwell 
insisted that the problems could be managed if everyone worked together in a 
businesslike fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Although few details of the impending layoffs are known, the source said that 
the city's ambulance service would not be affected by the first wave of cuts. 
City Manager James Goins, who was fired by the council last week after 
introducing a $101-million budget, had suggested eliminating the ambulance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
City administrators, the source said, are anxious to get the layoff notices in 
the mail as soon as possible because Civil Service rules require that those 
being let go receive a 30-day notice. As a result, the city must continue to 
pay their salaries into the new fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Goins firing last week underscored what has been a festering fiscal issue 
for at least six months, ever since City Controller Brown began warning that 
the city was spending too much money and would end up with a shortfall this 
year and layoffs in the coming year. Goins was insisting that there was no 
budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, after he submitted a budget to the council which contained 
layoffs in the Fire Department and cuts in the Police Department, as well as 
new taxes and fee increases that the council had never approved, the city 
manager was fired on a 5-0 council vote. Caldwell, senior assistant city 
manager, was named acting manager and told to bring to the council a new budget 
proposal that did not contain increased revenues from new taxes and higher 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Though Brown declined to talk to The Times about the budget and the cuts, he 
did say that he could come up with only $82 million in anticipated revenues for 
the coming year. Goins' budget called for spending $19 million more than that. 
</P>
<P>
Goins cut Brown out of budget preparations after the two officials differed 
openly over the city's financial condition. Brown had warned that the city 
would face a severe financial crunch. Goins insisted, however, that the City 
Council could balance the budget and avoid layoffs if it approved new taxes and 
fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members told Goins during budget planning sessions that they would 
be reluctant to approve such measures. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell said during a break in the council meeting Tuesday night that his 
budget proposal will not include increases in municipal water rates or the 
utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
The council set another public hearing at 3:25 p.m. Tuesday to allow comment on 
Caldwell's budget proposals. The budget document will be available for public 
review by Friday in the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Through a staff member, Caldwell said he would not be available for comment on 
the layoffs.

FARMHOUSE BLUES; 
</P>
<P>
OWNER UPSET AFTER COUNCIL PRESERVES HIS LAND, THEN DECIDES TO USE IT FOR ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ventura City Council wanted to preserve the city's open spaces, and that 
included Ed Duval's 28 acres of lemon groves. 
</P>
<P>
But the council also had future growth and traffic problems on its mind, and 
that called for eventually extending Kimball Road in East Ventura -- right 
through the same lemon groves and, most likely, the little farmhouse where 
Duval spent his childhood years. 
</P>
<P>
The politicians had focused for three weeks on the big issues confronting 
Ventura, but Duval was convinced they had made at least one mistake. 
</P>
<P>
In his view, it didn't make much sense that they had voted to save his land one 
day and then approved building a road through it the next. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearings Concluded 
</P>
<P>
This week, as the council finally concluded its marathon future growth 
hearings, the 71-year-old Duval sat on the steps of the house where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
He was annoyed, he said, but not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"First they tell us we have to stay in agriculture," Duval said. "Then they 
want to lop off some more of my trees and probably bulldoze the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish they'd stay the hell out of here," he added. "But I didn't bother 
speaking out on this. I'm very familiar with the city of Ventura. It's 
pointless to ask them for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Duval's house is a three-bedroom brown frame farmhouse, shaded by a giant 
peppertree, where the half-completed Kimball Road now dumps its traffic onto 
Telephone Road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scenic Remnant 
</P>
<P>
Behind the house is an old barn where Duval once had a woodworking shop. There 
are a couple of toolsheds and an old water tower, all built sometime during 
World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by strawberry fields on one side and lemon trees on the others, the old 
farmhouse is a scenic remnant of the past sitting in semi-isolation amid the 
housing tracts of East Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Duval remembers when his father bought the house. They grew walnut trees in 
those days, and Duval and his brother helped pick the walnuts at harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not a particularly nostalgic man. He never wanted to be a farmer in 
the first place, Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
From an early age, he was interested mainly in his woodwork and in reading. 
From Ventura High School, he went to UC Berkeley and then to law school at UC 
Berkeley's Boalt Hall. 
</P>
<P>
After law school, Duval and his wife, Margaret, lived in the little farmhouse 
again until he built another just around the corner on Montgomery Avenue. Duval 
practiced law in Ventura until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Edwin, lived in the house until his death in 1965. Then it was 
occupied by one of the farmhands who actually worked the lemon crop. Then, when 
he died, it was briefly vacant. 
</P>
<P>
Vandals moved in, so Duval rented the house out to another of the farmhands who 
tended his orchards for one of the land management companies that actually do 
much of the farming in modern Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Vera and his wife and five children live there now. Duval says the rent 
is minimal, probably the cheapest in the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be here for quite a while probably," Duval said. "I expect the road 
will be coming through someday, but that someday may be long in coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it, obviously. Neither do they. You can't find a house like this 
at the minimal rent they pay anywhere around here. But there's nothing I can do 
except negotiate over the price when they decide to come through." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Specific Route 
</P>
<P>
That could be a decade away. No specific route has been planned for the road 
extension, city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Duval, one of Ventura's many reluctant farmers who would rather do something 
else with his land, said he would have preferred it if the City Council had 
opened the remaining 1,000 acres of East Ventura farmland to development. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be looking for someone to sell it to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But since the city has made preservation of farmland a major goal, Duval thinks 
the city should have decided to preserve his farmhouse too. 
</P>
<P>
"I could understand it if they were going to develop this area, but if they're 
not going to do that, they shouldn't keep chipping away for city uses," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Duval slowly walked around the property, noting where the Vera family had 
planted a row of rose bushes and pointed to a back-yard pen housing two pet 
peacocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any great sentimental attachment to this house," he said. "It 
will collapse under its own weight anyway one of these days. 
</P>
<P>
"But the city pretends to be such a great friend of the farmer. They will be 
wiping out a family here when they eventually build that road, and I doubt if 
they even thought about that at all."

POLLUTION CONTROLS PROPOSED FOR OIL RIGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM FULTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government has proposed a new regulation that would require many 
oil platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel to install cleaner-burning 
generators in order to reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
But officials in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and environmental groups 
say the regulation does not go far enough toward improving onshore air 
pollution problems, and they may sue if the regulation is approved by the 
Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County officials, along with their Santa Barbara counterparts and 
environmental groups, have fought for years to make offshore oil-drilling 
operations subject to the same clean air regulations as onshore industries. It 
has been an uphill battle because county officials have no direct control over 
offshore emissions, which are regulated by the Minerals Management Service, a 
division of the Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
That may change, however. The brewing debate in Congress over the Clean Air Act 
may mean that jurisdiction over offshore emissions will be transfered from the 
Interior Department to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which may 
be more sympathetic to the county's position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In a Bind 
</P>
<P>
Local officials have long complained that conflicting federal requirements put 
them in a bind. On one hand, the EPA requires them to count offshore emissions 
as part of the Ventura County air pollution problem. But on the other hand, 
because of the Interior Department's jurisdiction, the county has little 
control over the offshore sources of pollution. The result, officials say, is 
likely to be ever-tighter pollution controls onshore to make up for the 
offshore emissions. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're sitting here imposing controls that have the effect of reducing 
emissions one-tenth of one ton per day and they're out there putting out tons 
per day, they're hurting the gains we're making," said Richard Baldwin, 
executive officer of the county Air Pollution Control District. However, the 
oil industry disputes the claim that offshore pollution significantly affects 
onshore air quality. 
</P>
<P>
Offshore oil drilling creates air pollution mostly from the large power 
generators used to run drilling rigs and pumps. Though similar engines are 
subject to strict regulations onshore, the Minerals Management Service did not 
regulate offshore air pollution until 1980. Since then, the agency has required 
pollution-control measures on offshore platforms around the country if computer 
air-quality models show that offshore emissions contribute to onshore air 
pollution problems. These measures have included clean-burning gas turbines, 
sulfur recovery units and waste-heat recovery systems, which reduce the size of 
generators needed on the platforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separate Standards 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, the state and environmentalists have been engaged in litigation 
with the Interior Department to force a separate set of tougher offshore air 
pollution standards for California. As part of this litigation, officials from 
local, state and federal agencies, along with oil company representatives and 
environmentalists, engaged in secret negotiations for more than two years. 
However, the negotiations broke down in late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Then in January, the Interior Department issued a proposed new regulation for 
California offshore pollution. Under the proposal, offshore platforms emitting 
air pollutants above a certain level would have to install pollution control 
technologies in all circumstances, no matter what the computer modeling 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry officials say the rule would go too far. "It would be very 
difficult to live with," said Donna Black, an attorney for the Western States 
Petroleum Assn. However, she added, "I wouldn't go so far as to say that, under 
this proposed rule, nobody would be able to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
But the new regulation is not as strict as present onshore regulations. For 
example, offshore facilities must install equipment to reduce emissions of 
so-called "ozone precursors" -- gases that help create smog -- only if they 
produce more than 46 tons per year, while Ventura County's present threshold 
for onshore facilities is 25 tons per year. Ozone smog is Ventura County's 
major air pollution problem, and regulation of ozone precursors is the major 
technique used to reduce local pollution both onshore and offshore. 
</P>
<P>
"At a minimum, the regulation should control offshore areas the same way 
onshore areas are controlled," said Mark Abramowitz, director of the Santa 
Monica-based Coalition for Clean Air, who led environmentalists in the 
negotiation effort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Area of Jurisdiction 
</P>
<P>
The proposed regulation specifically steers clear of the pollution emissions 
created by crew and supply boats that serve the rigs, which a recent study has 
identified as part of the problem. "We don't feel we have the jurisdiction to 
regulate crew and supply boats while they're in transit," said Mitchell Baer, a 
Minerals Management meteorologist who wrote the proposed regulation. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Minerals Management has received a stack of comments on the proposed 
regulation at least 10 feet high. Baldwin said that if the final rule is 
similar to the proposal, he will probably recommend that the county sue to make 
it tougher. The Interior Department has no timetable for issuing a final 
regulation.

STREET RENAMING SPURS LYNWOOD RECALL EFFORT 
</P>

<P>
Residents and business owners who do not want to rename Century Boulevard in 
honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. are attempting to remove the two city 
councilmen and the mayor who voted for the change. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Robert Henning and Paul H. Richards were served Tuesday with notices 
of intention to circulate recall petitions against them. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Evelyn Wells was not served because the law does not permit recall 
attempts against elected officials with less than six months remaining in 
office, attorney Michael Cambridge, one of the leaders of the recall attempt, 
told the council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wells is up for reelection in November. However, on Tuesday Cambridge did not 
say why recall papers were filed against Richards, who is also on the November 
ballot. Cambridge could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
While serving the recall petitions to council members on Tuesday, Cambridge 
accused them of "using high-handed arrogance" and being "drunk with power in 
changing the name of the street." 
</P>
<P>
During the celebration of Black History Month in February, the council voted 3 
to 2 to rename a 3 1/2-mile section of Century Boulevard in the northern part 
of the city. Wells, Richards and Henning voted in favor of the renaming. 
Councilman E. L. Morris and Councilman Louis J. Heine voted against it, but 
they supported renaming other streets in the city after King. 
</P>
<P>
Richards and Henning are accused in the petitions of not giving adequate notice 
to residents and businesses along Century Boulevard before the renaming. 
</P>
<P>
The recall petitions assert that the renaming also will place a major financial 
burden on the boulevard's businesses because they will have to reprint 
letterheads and labels. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Henning is accused of being involved in the disappearance from 
City Hall of petitions signed by more than 2,000 people who objected to the 
name change. 
</P>
<P>
The signatures opposing the name change were submitted shortly before April 21 
when the council held a ceremony to rename the street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Police Report 
</P>
<P>
Wells said that after reviewing the petitions, she passed them on to Henning. 
Henning said they were later stolen from his car. No police report was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Richards and Henning have seven days in which to reply to the accusations made 
in the recall petitions. If the petitions are approved by the city clerk, 
recall backers will have 120 days to collect signatures. They will need the 
signatures of about 20% of the more than 14,000 registered voters to force a 
recall election, City Clerk Andrea Hooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooper said that during her seven years as clerk three notices of recall 
petitions have been filed against council members, but there have never been 
enough signatures gathered to force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the latest recall attempt is a political tactic to try to defeat 
him at the polls in November. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to parlay it (the street renaming controversy) into a 
political gain," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
He accused Emma Mendez Esparaza, one of the recall proponents, of "using 
something that is obviously a point of racial tension" to get elected to 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Esparaza, a private workers' compensation consultant whose Lynwood office is on 
the renamed street, said she did not originally intend to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, "if they continue to make this a racist issue, I might run." 
</P>
<P>
Wells, Henning and Richards are black. Heine and Morris are white. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the continuing controversy would destroy the "racial and ethnic 
harmony" in the city. Lynwood, predominantly Latino, has a population of about 
54,000. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he knew the decision to name a street after a black would cause 
controversy but he did not regret doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll wear this recall (attempt) with pride," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cambridge, who is black and also has an office on the renamed street, said he 
was "disappointed that race was injected" into the issue.

SAN DIMAS POT CROP CALLED PART OF GROWING TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neighbors had no reason to suspect that the spacious, luxury home on South 
Walnut Avenue was any different from the other houses in the upscale area of 
San Dimas. But at the top of a steep, winding driveway, hidden behind a dense 
grove of eucalyptus trees, police discovered what they said was Los Angeles 
County's largest indoor marijuana plantation. 
</P>
<P>
When drug agents raided the 5,000-square-foot home last month, they found a 
high-tech hydroponic hothouse, with 631 marijuana plants basking under 
1,000-watt grow lights and soaking in nutrient-enriched solutions. In all, 
agents seized 1,212 pounds of marijuana -- some of it already processed and 
packaged -- with an estimated street value of $4.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Agents arrested Rollin Scott Forteville, owner of the house, and Jeff Jenkins. 
The two pleaded not guilty to felony charges of marijuana cultivation. Their 
trial in U.S. District Court is scheduled to begin July 5, said Mary McMenimen, 
spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've run into anything like this," said Sheriff's Lt. 
R. David Dietrich, a member of the San Gabriel Valley Narcotics Enforcement 
Team. "We haven't (previously) found a case of someone taking a house of this 
size and value and using it to grow marijuana." 
</P>
<P>
But drug agents at the state and federal level said police in Southern 
California should expect to encounter similar large-scale indoor marijuana 
farms with increasing regularity in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming very prevalent," said Charley Stowell, California marijuana 
coordinator for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. "They're using 
residences, they're using garages. A lot of them are actually tunneling 
underground in yards and basements." 
</P>
<P>
The San Dimas seizure was a record indoor haul for Los Angeles County, but 
small compared to seizures elsewhere in the state. Earlier this month, agents 
confiscated a record 8,000 plants from a barn in the Northern California 
community of Loomis. Last year, the DEA confiscated about 3,500 plants growing 
in a barn in San Luis Obispo and more than 3,000 plants crammed into a modest 
tract house in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that pot growers are moving their business indoors to 
escape the prying eyes of the agents who use helicopters to spot illegal 
agriculture. Such airborne surveillance intensified in 1983, when the state 
attorney general's office launched its Campaign Against Marijuana Planting 
(CAMP). 
</P>
<P>
At the program's outset, the DEA identified almost 900,000 plants growing 
statewide, of which more than 580,000 escaped eradication by authorities. By 
1986, the number of plants grown had dropped to 242,000, with 87% of those 
destroyed before harvest, leaving less than 20,000 to make it to the illegal 
drug market. 
</P>
<P>
Although agents have continued to eradicate between 85% and 88% of the 
marijuana grown statewide over the last two years, the total number of plants 
grown -- and hence the number to avoid destruction -- has increased. Last year, 
more than 43,000 plants were successfully harvested, according to the DEA. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities cite the escalating price of high-grade sinsemilla, which has 
spiraled from $1,900 to $3,500 a pound in five years, as the prime reason for 
the rebound in marijuana growing. And as the marijuana trade has become more 
lucrative, indoor growing has become more prevalent, agents said. 
</P>
<P>
Drug agents raided 270 indoor growing operations last year, up from 172 in 1987 
and 115 in 1986. The average indoor operation discovered by the DEA has about 
1,000 plants, as compared to 200 for the average outdoor garden, Stowell said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that they're going indoors," said Jack Beecham, special 
agent for the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, who is in charge of CAMP. 
"There's just tremendous pressure being put on (growers) from the outside. 
There was really no reason to go inside five years ago. It was just rampant in 
(the Northern) part of the state." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that they're going indoors," said Jack Beecham, special 
agent for the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, who is in charge of CAMP. 
"There's just tremendous pressure being put on (growers) from the outside. 
There was really no reason to go inside five years ago. It was just rampant in 
this part of the state." 
</P>
<P>
After their sweeping success in combatting outdoor marijuana farms, CAMP agents 
are finding the going more difficult now that the battle has moved indoors. 
</P>
<P>
"It changes the picture," Beecham said. "Obviously, you can't spot it from the 
air, so you have to go back to the traditional methods, using informants and 
doing investigations. It's slower and more cumbersome." 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping to shield them from authorities, indoor cultivation offers 
numerous other advantages to marijuana growers. Their plants are protected from 
hazards such as wild animals and human predators. By controlling the amount and 
angle of artificial light, growers can simulate the changing seasons and 
harvest continuously throughout the year, agents said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Experimentation 
</P>
<P>
Indoor growing also provides greater opportunities for botanical 
experimentation, such as cloning. Growers "breed" plants asexually to increase 
both yield and potency. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, much of California's indoor-grown marijuana has a concentration of 
tetrahyrdrocannabinol (THC) -- the intoxicating agent in the drug -- nine times 
that of pot smuggled from Mexico. The increased potency translates to greater 
profits for growers and traffickers, who can get up to $3,500 a pound locally 
for high-grade marijuana. Some use the pot as barter for other drugs, Stowell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dope from here in California is showing up in Florida and South America to be 
traded for cocaine," Stowell said. "There, the sinsemilla from California will 
fetch up to $6,000 a pound on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Although the potential for profit is much greater for indoor marijuana growers, 
so are the costs and the risks. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment for a large-scale indoor-lighting and growing system can run more 
than $50,000. Electric and water bills can exceed $5,000 a month, reducing the 
grower's income and possibly raising the suspicions of the local utility 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor growers often locate their plots on publicly owned land, such as 
national forests, to avoid being linked to the plot. But when an indoor 
operation is discovered, the owner or resident of the house involved has a hard 
row to hoe in trying to prove innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard to say you didn't know who that garden belonged to when it's 
in your bathroom or garage," Beecham said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
House Was Seized 
</P>
<P>
And indoor growers who are arrested risk more than the loss of their freedom. 
Under a federal law enacted in 1985, property used in the production, 
transportation or trafficking of illegal drugs is subject to seizure by the 
U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Although the law has been used most often to seize boats, planes and cars, it 
led to the seizure of Forteville's 5,000-square-foot San Dimas house, valued at 
more than $1 million. But before agents an seize a marijuana grower's pot and 
possessions, they need some clue as to which of the millions of homes in 
California is hiding an illicit operation behind its walls. Usually, this 
requires an informant. Beecham said it is difficult for a person to grow large 
amounts of marijuana indoors without authorities getting wind of it. 
</P>
<P>
"There also seems to be someone willing to tell you about someone who's growing 
it," he said. "Sometimes they're disgruntled partners, disgruntled girlfriends 
or just a citizen noticing something suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
At times, the grower himself may unwittingly provide the tip that sparks an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't Allow Meter Readings 
</P>
<P>
In the San Dimas case, Stowell said, Forteville aroused suspicion by refusing 
to allow meter readers from Southern California Edison. Forteville eventually 
agreed to escort a meter reader from the front gate to the house, Stowell said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the way a normal person in a normal situation acts," Stowell said. 
"That's suspicious. It's not probable cause in and of itself, but it's another 
brick in the wall." 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to build a case of probable cause needed for a search warrant, 
agents may check a suspected grower's utility bills. In the San Dimas case, 
authorities noted that Forteville's electric bills often exceeded $3,000 a 
month, Dietrich said. 
</P>
<P>
Once they have zeroed in on a suspected indoor marijuana grower, agents often 
return to using helicopters -- their weapon of choice in the battle against 
outdoor growing -- to confirm their suspicions. Using an infrared detection 
device, agents check whether a house believed to be the site of an indoor pot 
farm is generating excessive heat from the numerous 1,000-watt lights inside. 
</P>
<P>
Although helicopters are used for random surveillance in Northern California to 
detect outdoor marijuana gardens, Stowell said the DEA does not fly 
reconnaissance missions over suburban housing tracts in hopes of detecting an 
indoor farm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indoor Growers Warned 
</P>
<P>
"Big Brother doesn't circle neighborhoods looking for houses that put out a lot 
of heat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No figures have been compiled this year of indoor marijuana-growing operations, 
but Stowell said he expects the sharp increases of the last two years to be 
repeated. In his annual address to CAMP agents last November, state Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van De Kamp warned indoor growers that they have not escaped 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of growers thought they'd heard the last of CAMP when they . . . moved 
inside and pulled down the shades," Van De Kamp said. "But the unofficial CAMP 
motto is, 'You can run but you can't hide.' The indoor growers will learn what 
that means."

SCOPE: DIAPERS, A DIPLOMA AND DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crisply pressed, satin-white gown and mortarboard, with the blue and gold 
Class of '89 tassel already attached, hung conspicuously in one corner of 
Gladys Cabibbo's family room last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the 18-year-old Montebello High School honors student, who will collect her 
diploma with about 500 other graduates tonight, was far too busy changing her 
daughter's diaper and chasing after her young son to make much ado about what 
many consider to be one of life's high points. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, I guess I am ready for it (graduation)," Cabibbo said 
nonchalantly as she held month-old Portia over her shoulder and patted her 
baby's back gently. She is already looking ahead to September, when she will 
begin studying to be an accountant, on a full scholarship, at a local college. 
</P>
<P>
After almost two years of balancing class work with the challenges that go 
along with being a young parent, Cabibbo has beat the heavy odds against 
staying in school. And she did it with honors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholarship Worth $19,000 
</P>
<P>
Earning a 3.57 grade-point average in her senior year, Cabibbo has accepted a 
full scholarship, valued at $19,000, to the DeVry Institute of Technology. She 
was accepted at Cal State Los Angeles, but passed it up to attend DeVry, where 
she plans to earn a bachelor of science degree in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better for me," said Cabibbo of the Illinois-based institute's various 
academic programs for non-traditional students. "It gives me time to work and 
time to take care of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Cabibbo is one of three students awarded full scholarships this school year at 
DeVry's City of Industry campus. She competed against nearly 750 high school 
students who applied for the scholarships, which are awarded yearly by a panel 
of local high school principals, counselors and administrators of the technical 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 20 young mothers and mothers-to-be graduating this year from the 
Montebello Unified School District's Pregnant Minor Program, only Cabibbo and 
one other woman plan to go on to a four-year college, said director Mary Lou 
Williams. The program, part of the district's alternative education department, 
is based at Montebello High. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 girls a year enroll in the four-year-old Pregnant Minor Program, which 
was established by the district to combat a trend by pregnant teen-agers to 
drop out of school, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 18,000 school-age girls in the county became pregnant, and 
an estimated 80% of those did not finish high school, Williams said. The 
Pregnant Minor Program provides the students with a flexible learning 
environment while they prepare to become mothers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Williams admits, almost one-third of those enrolled in the Pregnant 
Minor Program eventually drop out if they are not close to graduating when they 
have their babies. 
</P>
<P>
Cabibbo, who had her first child when she was entering her junior year, said 
she remained in school because of the support of her family and the program's 
teachers and administrators, and a longtime desire to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
Cabibbo's academic accomplishment, however, came amid financial and personal 
troubles that began in the months after the evening in 1986 that she met Tommy 
Cabibbo, now her husband. Gladys Alberto, then 15, and a few of her Catholic 
high school friends decided to try to get into a popular Los Angeles rock 'n' 
roll nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
They were admitted to the 18-and-over club, she said. "I was with my friends, 
and (Tommy) was with his," she recalled. "He was cute, so we started dancing." 
</P>
<P>
She ended up hitching a ride home to Montebello with Tommy, who was 18 at the 
time and had recently graduated from Montebello High. "I didn't know him 
before," she said recently. "But he only lived down the street." 
</P>
<P>
Gladys soon became pregnant, married Tommy and left St. Paul's Catholic High 
School at the end of her sophomore year, she said. Her father, Cleo Alberto, 
who had objected to his daughter's marriage, accompanied her when she enrolled 
in the Pregnant Minor Program. "He was really understanding," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Dari Alberto, Cabibbo's mother, said that her daughter's unexpected pregnancy 
and marriage devastated her. "I didn't know what to do," she said. "I only 
wanted her to finish school, no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
During her pregnancy with Tommy Jr., Cabibbo's father suffered a massive stroke 
and fell into a coma. He revived and returned home in time to see his grandson, 
now 16 months old, Dari Alberto said. Cleo Alberto died two months later. 
</P>
<P>
Gladys and Tommy then decided to have a second child. Gladys finished her class 
work in April, and Portia was born about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evicted From Apartment 
</P>
<P>
The young couple attempted to "go it alone" until they were evicted from their 
apartment recently for non-payment of rent. Tommy lives with his parents and 
works with his uncle in construction, while Gladys lives with her mother and 
two younger sisters. "It's not like we had a fight or anything like that," 
Gladys Cabibbo said about the separation. "We couldn't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
Cabibbo said she and her husband have agreed to live apart until she settles 
into the college routine and he earns more money. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the past two years, however, has been traumatic, Cabibbo said. She 
laughs when she remembers the time she had to rewrite an assignment that had 
taken hours to complete. 
</P>
<P>
"I caught him (Tommy Jr.) eating my papers," Cabibbo said. "He always used to 
write on them, too." 
</P>
<P>
Cabibbo said that she enjoyed high school and never considered dropping out. "I 
always wanted to go to college. I was always interested in math and I wanted to 
make a career out of (that interest)". 
</P>
<P>
When asked if her husband is supportive of her college plans and ambition to 
become an accountant, she said, "Sure. He told me that he wants me to grow up 
to be a rich CPA (certified public accountant) for a big company so he can stay 
home and cook for me."

$5,000 REWARD OFFERED IN DRIVE-BY KILLING OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Norwalk City Council on Tuesday voted to offer a $5,000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who killed John 
Glenn High School football star Juan Enriquez in a drive-by shooting last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said Wednesday that no one 
was in custody in connection with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies suspect that gang members shot Enriquez, who was not a gang member, as 
he walked near his Norwalk home on May 9.

HALL ENDORSES CLARK IN ELECTION BID FOR MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilwoman Jan Hall has endorsed Councilman Tom Clark in his bid for Mayor 
Ernie Kell's position in next spring's election. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who represents the 3rd District, ran against Kell last year, taking about 
40% of the vote in a runoff that Kell won. Clark supported her in that contest. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Clark's concern for our city is evidenced in his longtime dedication and 
participation as a member of the City Council, as mayor for seven years, in 
addition to his extensive community service with many local organizations. I 
enthusiastically endorse Tom as the next mayor of Long Beach . . .," Hall said 
in a statement last week. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's position, formerly a ceremonial one assumed by members of the 
council, last year became a full-time post filled in a citywide election.

ANTI-NOISE HOT LINE URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Got a gripe about noisy cement trucks or jackhammers piercing the tranquillity 
of your home or office? 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Christine Reed may have the answer. Reed wants to set up a 
telephone hot line for residents with complaints about noise from construction 
sites or after-hours construction. Building is not permitted before 7 a.m. or 
on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said residents often feel guilty calling police with these kinds of 
complaints, which could better be handled by building inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Reed also urged that violators be punished with something more than a ticket. 
Construction companies might be forced to close for a day, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the enforcement authority of stopping the work on a project," Reed 
said. "We ought to use that authority more often." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone number for the hot line would be posted on construction notice 
signs. The City Council voted Tuesday night to have its staff work out the 
details.

PROP. A. COURSE SUGGESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Key members of a financial strategy committee for the schools have decided to 
recommend not resubmitting Proposition A to the voters in the November 
election, as some proponents of the measure had called for. 
</P>
<P>
Although proponents of Proposition A had called for it to be resubmitted to the 
voters, key members of a financial strategy committee for the schools have 
recommended against doing so. 
</P>
<P>
The tax measure, which would have imposed a $98 parcel tax for five years to 
increase the city's school budget, was narrowly defeated in a special election 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hartsfield, treasurer of the Schools Financial Strategy Committee, said 
that committee leaders had decided that they should analyze "where we went 
wrong" in the earlier election before going back to the voters. To qualify for 
the November election, the Board of Education would have to approve the measure 
by Wednesday, then schedule a public hearing for no later than July 6. 
</P>
<P>
The financial strategy committee is considering a revised tax measure, which 
would exempt senior citizens as a way of overcoming resistance from elderly 
voters. The committee leaders will poll the two dozen members next week and 
make a formal recommendation to the Board of Education, which will make the 
final decision on when to submit a new measure.

PARKING RATES TO GO UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parking-meter rates will double in parts of the business district starting July 
1, from 50 cents to $1 an hour, to catch up with nearby cities' rates and help 
solve a parking-operation cash-flow problem. 
</P>
<P>
New monthly parking fees will range from $40 to $120. This compares to a 
$45-to-$145-range in Westwood and West Los Angeles and $60 to $220 in Century 
City, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Director of Finance Administration Donald J. Oblander has also suggested 
several other options for the City Council to consider, including modification 
of the two-hour free parking program and the formation of parking assessment 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
"The parking enterprise has had an operating deficit for five or six years," 
Oblander said after the meeting. He expects the city to reach or surpass 
break-even points within three years with the changes. 
</P>
<P>
The parking fee increases were part of a comprehensive ordinance passed by the 
City Council on Tuesday to adjust fees for water, waste water, building 
permits, business licenses and other items.

ANTI-FREEWAY PLAN OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens watchdog group has criticized a City Council plan to hire a North 
Hollywood public relations firm to represent the city in its fight to stop the 
completion of the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Bernardi has been authorized by the council to contract with 
Glazer &amp; Associates for up $1,000 a month to publicize the reasons for the 
city's opposition to a state Department of Transportation plan to run the last 
leg of the freeway through the middle of the city. The firm would conduct a 
campaign aimed at the media, community leaders and the public. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, Bernardi said, is to "put out the message, up and down the state, 
that South Pasadena is not an obstructionist when it comes to the freeway . . . 
that South Pasadena has, on many occasions, offered different alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
"Bernardi spends money like a drunken sailor," said Thomas Beisek, a member of 
South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn., which has frequently criticized city spending 
policies. Added Robert Cook, chairman of the group: "I don't see the need for 
all this money being spent for a questionable return." Both contend that the 
money might be more wisely invested in a war chest to fight the freeway plan in 
the courts, if it is approved by the Department of Transportation.

57-UNIT PROJECT APPROVED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, deciding not to wait for the results of a pending land-use 
study, has approved a zoning change along San Gabriel Canyon Road to allow a 
57-unit condominium project on almost nine acres. 
</P>
<P>
The change was approved 3 to 0 on Monday, with Mayor Eugene F. Moses and 
Councilman Bruce Latta abstaining because they own property near the site and 
have a potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The project is next to Moses' Canyon City Ghost Town, the object of a city 
public-nuisance action. The mayor is negotiating with the city over removal of 
most of the buildings on his would-be Western theme park. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Harry L. Stemrich requested a zoning study in January when it was 
announced that Moses intended to sell his 2.5-acre ghost town, saying the city 
did not want more multifamily units in the area. The study is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project was labeled a condominium, it actually will have separate 
units. The single-family homes will be located on small lots, averaging 3,000 
square feet, that have common areas, said Roy E. Bruckner, director of 
community development. The city has no provision for such a development at this 
time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Landowners Johnny E. Johnson and the Speckert Trust will sell their parcels to 
Brea-based D &amp; D Development for the project. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Moses said the zone change violated a standing agreement 
between property owners that the area was to remain "rustic." City officials 
said Azusa was never part of any such private agreement.

<P>
COUNCIL REVERSES ITSELF; 183 PALM TREES CAN STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has reversed its decision to remove 183 palm trees after 
considering the appeal of protesting residents who said the trees hold an 
aesthetic value to Huntington Park that will aid in attracting home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Canary Island palms have reached heights of 60 feet, and the 
council thought the trees were a liability because of falling branches and 
maintenance costs. There also was concern that tree roots would crack 
sidewalks. A contractor had agreed to pay the city $206 for each palm 
transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
The palms were scheduled for removal June 7. But Jerald Russell, a six-month 
resident, learned of the action earlier that week and in a few hours organized 
his neighbors to attend a City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Roberts said the council thought its original decision was in 
the best interest of the people, but decided to do what the people wanted.

BREAKFASTS FOR HOMELESS

<P>
Free breakfasts will be provided at the temporary homeless shelter in West 
Hollywood Park Auditorium for six months beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote, the City Council approved $5,000 for the breakfast program, 
which will provide the homeless with fresh fruit and protein snack bars. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Abbe Land and John Heilman voted against the proposal, asking 
the council to delay a decision until after discussions on the 1989-90 budget 
begin this week. 
</P>
<P>
During budget talks, city officials are expected to discuss the possibility of 
discontinuing the temporary facility and putting funds into the development of 
a permanent shelter, Land said. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern was that we would approve this, and two weeks later we would 
eliminate the whole program," Land said.

ACTIVIST IS 1ST TO THROW HER HAT INTO COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Community activist Shirley Garcia has announced that she will run for the 
Montebello City Council in November. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, one of several community leaders who successfully opposed a proposal to 
grant the Community Redevelopment Agency eminent-domain powers in south 
Montebello, is the first person to formally announce intentions to run for 
Mayor William Nighswonger's position. Nighswonger has announced that he will 
retire from the council in November. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, a paralegal for a Los Angeles law firm, did not say when she will begin 
campaigning. She claims the support of anti-drug and Neighborhood Watch groups, 
and said she favors a two-term limit for council members and other elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Edward Pizzorno and Arnold Glasman are running for reelection to the 
five-member panel. Pizzorno, who also opposed the city's bid for the power of 
eminent domain, is generally expected to be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Montebello voters in May rejected three ballot measures that would have given 
the Redevelopment Agency eminent domain power in two largely industrial and 
commercial sections of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Glasman, who supported the plan to foster redevelopment in the area, is 
expected to be in for a campaign battle with eminent domain opponents. Larry 
Salazar, who also campaigned against the ballot measures, has indicated that he 
will seek to unseat Glasman. He has not, however, made any formal announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Former Councilman William Molinari, the most popular leader of the anti-eminent 
domain forces, said that he may run for the council in November.

BOARD ACTION EXPECTED ON WALNUT STREET SCHOOL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education is expected to 
consider a controversial proposal to tear down 263 homes, apartments and 
businesses in Bell and Cudahy to build an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
The school construction plan, proposed jointly by the district and officials of 
both cities, has been criticized by residents who would be displaced by the new 
school, tentatively called Walnut Street Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The board will decide on Monday whether to order an environmental impact 
report, real estate appraisals and relocation costs for the 13-acre site that 
is bounded by Florence Avenue on the north, Wilcox Avenue on the west, Live Oak 
Street on the south and Crafton Avenue on the east. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary school would be located both in Cudahy and Bell and would be 
named for Walnut Street, the cul-de-sac that would cease to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie R. James, school district building services division administrator, 
stressed this week that the Walnut Street site is one of three under 
consideration. The other two sites are located in Cudahy and are about half the 
size of the Walnut Street site.

20-STORY TOWER PLANNED; 
</P>
<P>
AGENCY OKS PLANS FOR HIGH-RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday approved modified plans to speed 
traffic circulation around the city's largest proposed high-rise office and 
retail development. 
</P>
<P>
Agency members voted 3 to 2 to permit Homart Development Co. of Chicago to 
proceed with plans to build a 20-story office and retail development at 
Broadway and Brand Boulevard, directly north of the Glendale Galleria. The site 
has been vacant for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The developer plans to build a second tower 22 stories high after the first 
phase of the project is completed. Construction is tentatively scheduled to 
begin early next year, said Barbara Knight, acting redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
Agency members Larry Zarian and Ginger Bremberg have consistently voted against 
the project on the grounds that the 790,000-square-foot development is 90,000 
square feet larger than the city had deemed suitable for the site and that it 
will worsen downtown traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of objections, the developer this week agreed to install additional 
traffic turn lanes, restrict the flow of traffic out of a parking garage to 
right turns only and update traffic signals at major intersections to allow 
protected left turns. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the changes, Zarian and Bremberg still voted against the project. 
</P>
<P>
Homart proposes to build the 20-story tower at the southern end of the block 
bounded by Broadway, Brand, Wilson Avenue and Orange Street. A temporary park 
will be built on the northern end of the block, where the 22-story tower 
eventually will be built. The block now is surrounded by a deteriorating 
construction fence.

$243-MILLION BUDGET, UTILITY TAX HIKE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday approved a $243-million budget for the 
1989-90 fiscal year, which calls for 63 new employees and the first utility tax 
hike in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they were worried about the 11% increase in the spending 
plan and vowed to return to slow-growth spending patterns of previous years. 
</P>
<P>
However, at their request, two new positions -- one in the Planning Department 
and another in the Public Works Department -- were added to the 61 recommended 
by City Manager David Ramsay. Last year, 13 new positions were included in the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
The utility tax increase from 5% to 7% was originally approved in 1978, but the 
council had postponed its implementation until this year. The council also 
raised the cut-off level of maximum earnings from $7,500 to $10,500 a year for 
low-income residents to be exempt from paying the tax.

WOMAN STABBED TO DEATH WITH KITCHEN KNIFE; 
</P>
<P>
MAN CONVICTED IN WIFE'S MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man on trial in the stabbing death of his wife was convicted of 
second-degree murder this week by a Pasadena Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Haro Agakian, 40, was found guilty of stabbing his wife, Judy Agakian, 37, with 
a kitchen knife in the master bedroom of their apartment in the 300 block of 
North Isabel Street on March 16, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Terry Smerling heard the case after Agakian waived his right to a jury 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution and defense agreed that Agakian stabbed his wife after a bitter 
argument. But at issue in the much-delayed, five-week trial was whether the 
killing was premeditated. Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna L. Wills had asked the judge 
for a first-degree murder conviction, arguing that the killing was planned. 
Defense attorney Bradley W. Brunon had argued for a verdict of voluntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defendant's Wounds 
</P>
<P>
Wills sought to prove that Agakian brought two serrated kitchen knives to the 
third-floor bedroom with the intention of killing his wife and then himself. 
Agakian suffered six superficial stab wounds to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Wills argued at the trial that Agakian killed his wife in anger over their 
pending divorce. Wills said Agakian had discovered in February that Judy 
Agakian was having an affair. They filed for divorce but continued sharing the 
apartment, sleeping in separate bedrooms. Wills said Agakian was distressed 
that she was looking forward to the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the defense stipulation that Agakian had stabbed his wife, Agakian 
testified that he does not remember the events of that night and whether he did 
so was "anybody's guess." 
</P>
<P>
Brunon said that his client's chest wounds were inflicted by Judy Agakian and 
that Agakian then "lost control and in a fit of anger stabbed his wife to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
In returning the second-degree murder verdict, Smerling said he was convinced 
that the killing was murder rather than manslaughter but he remained 
unconvinced that Agakian had planned his wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
Agakian is being held in Los Angeles County Jail. A sentencing hearing is 
scheduled July 28. He faces a maximum sentence of 16 years to life in prison.

COACH DEVOTES HIMSELF TO HIS BOYS AND BASKETBALL; 
</P>
<P>
'HE'S LIKE THE FATHER I NEVER HAD,' SAYS ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he makes his living as an accountant, Joe Perry's life is basketball 
and the street children who play it. To them, this Christian man in shorts and 
T-shirt is both coach and guiding light, instilling character and respect along 
with the man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like the father I never had," said Stais Boseman of Inglewood, a 6-foot-2 
eighth-grader on Perry's champion 14-and-under Long Beach Lakers. "He does a 
lot for us. You don't have money, he buys you stuff to eat. He teaches 
basketball and sportsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were in their purple shorts in the First Baptist Church gym in 
downtown Long Beach. Beneath dim lights, breakaway rims snapped down and back 
in place as the taller youngsters, already under the influence of Michael 
Jordan, attempted dunk shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I put in more time at this than I do at my actual job," said Perry, 31, who 
works for a Santa Fe Springs manufacturing firm. He was quietly overseeing the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He overflows with basketball," said Perry's wife, Charlotte, watching from a 
small set of bleachers. "Each year I ask him, 'How many teams are you going to 
coach?' so I can get myself mentally prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who was a guard at Harbor City Christian High School but continued his 
playing career only in recreation leagues because he thought his 5-9 height was 
against him, also coaches two youth teams in Cerritos. He was assistant varsity 
coach at Leffingwell Christian High in Norwalk from 1980 to 1986. He first 
coached when he was 13 and does not foresee stopping. Due to the satisfaction 
he gets from working with younger players, he says he has no desire to return 
to coaching at a high school. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago he formed the Lakers, finding the eighth- and ninth-graders by 
corresponding with junior high schools and visiting parks and playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, 42-7 since last October, won the championship of the spring junior 
varsity division of the American Roundball Corp.'s Future Stars League at 
Artesia High School, and are in the ARC Summer League at North Hollywood High. 
They are among the elite of privately supported traveling teams, which consist 
of better grade-school and junior-high players. They play almost year-round, 
usually in tournaments, sometimes in other states. There are several traveling 
team leagues, ARC and Slam-n-Jam being the biggest. The leagues are not 
associated with schools. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very unselfish players," Perry said of his Lakers. "They brag about 
points after a game, but during a game they think about winning. I tell them 
it's not good if you score 30 points and we lose. They never give up, each 
player has the desire to win." 
</P>
<P>
The leaders on the team include Boseman, averaging 22 points a game; Rudy 
Washington Jr., who averages 24 points a game and is the son of University of 
Iowa assistant coach Rudy Washington; and Marmet Williams, a 3-point specialist 
who will attend Mater Dei High School in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Lakers are from South-Central Los Angeles and Inglewood, 
although Long Beach, Lynwood, Cerritos and Fountain Valley are also 
represented. 
</P>
<P>
Perry is dedicated to helping inner-city youngsters. He normally picks up one 
group in Los Angeles and drives them to Long Beach for practice at the church 
gym that he rents for a minimal fee, while Charlotte, a sales secretary, picks 
up another group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Brother Image 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of them has the possibility of turning to gangs and drugs," said 
Perry, who sees himself as their big brother. "I think this will keep them out 
of trouble, off the streets. They have their own little spats, but I have not 
had any problems as far as their discipline with me. They fully respect me and 
all the adults involved. They are extremely disciplined. People are impressed; 
they expect them to be wild." 
</P>
<P>
Because of gangs and drugs, Perry said, fearful inner-city children are staying 
away from parks. "Outside their area they feel more comfortable," he said. 
"Stais was extremely quiet with me at first, but now has become very open and 
relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
On the court, a Laker missed a layup. "Got to make the basket, baby," Perry 
said, without raising his voice. 
</P>
<P>
It is Perry's intention to get the youngsters out of their environment and give 
them exposure that they've never had. "People I grew up with," he said, "are 
still on the same street, at the same house, living with their parents. These 
kids have the potential to end up like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have become seasoned travelers. They have gone in rented vans to San 
Francisco, Santa Barbara and Las Vegas, staying in hotels and motels, usually 
at Perry's expense. "The kids call it the pro life," he said. Even short trips 
to Trabuco Hills and Huntington Beach have been big events for the players, who 
had never seen gyms unmarred by graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Boseman said he and another player missed curfew one night and Perry "made us 
run 15 laps around the (motel) parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who, like his wife, grew up in a church environment, preaches about the 
importance of education. He suspended two Lakers until they improved their 
grades. He said more than 65% of the players have at least a B average. 
</P>
<P>
"It's super to be a good athlete," he said, "but these kids have to realize 
that, even if they go into the NBA and make a million dollars, you have to have 
some kind of education to know how to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
Perry's efforts have not gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"His kids are all of good character, and I'm sure that's a reflection of his 
teaching," said Rich Goldberg, director of ARC. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said that at first it was not easy to get parents interested. "They 
thought of me as a baby-sitter," he said. "They thought that if the kids were 
at practice or a game, they were out of their hair, and that was fine. It took 
them a while to see what was going on. When they saw that this was a positive 
thing, they started to come and watch the kids play, and get a little 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
The Perrys have two basketball-playing children who help with the Lakers. 
Daughter Shannon, a seventh-grader, calls the boys to let them know practice 
times, and fourth-grader Joey is the ball boy. 
</P>
<P>
The family has been such an inspiration that Betty Morris of Cerritos, whose 
son, Kevin, is a Laker, came up with the idea to start a Parents Who Care Youth 
Foundation so that tutoring programs can be provided for the youngsters. The 
foundation was set up by Lowell Henry, the team's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
Henry also acquired a sponsor in K-Swiss, which provides shoes for the team. 
Previously, Perry paid for shoes and uniforms himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him doing something without asking for help," Henry said. "He loves 
basketball, he loves these kids, he loves winning. But he was straining 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
When practice was over on that recent night, the players gathered around Perry. 
They listened intently, and it was apparent that his guiding light was shining 
some more.

23% OF MONTEBELLO UNIFIED'S CLASS OF 1988 DROPPED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A new study of dropout rates released this month shows that more than one in 
five high school students in the Montebello Unified School District's class of 
1988 failed to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is serious," school administrator Charles W. Norton told the Board of 
Education as he revealed results of the district's most comprehensive study of 
high school dropout rates. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to come up with some solutions to bring these figures down," he said 
during a presentation that included a variety of recommendations for 
identifying and counseling students who are at risk of dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
Norton, however, stressed in a telephone interview later that other studies 
show that Montebello Unified is doing better than other districts in retaining 
students, and the dropout rates noted by all studies are below the county 
average. 
</P>
<P>
The 31,787-student school district, the third largest in Los Angeles County, 
covers Montebello, Bell Gardens, Commerce and parts of Downey, East Los 
Angeles, Monterey Park, Pico Rivera, Rosemead and South San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
In the new study, school officials tracked 2,324 students at Montebello, Schurr 
and Bell Gardens high schools from enrollment as 10th-graders in 1985 to 
graduation in 1988, said Norton, who headed the effort. 
</P>
<P>
The study was the first in which district officials tracked a specific group of 
students through the last three years of high school. It lists students who 
graduated, dropped out, transferred to other schools or entered alternative 
education programs, Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 23% of students in the class of 1988 dropped out, according to the 
survey. Bell Gardens High, which has a higher percentage of low-income Latino 
students, had the highest dropout rate -- 27.32%. Montebello High's dropout 
rate was 20.7%, and Schurr High's rate was 20.32%. 
</P>
<P>
Previous dropout studies, which have been used by district and state education 
officials, calculated district dropout rates that were as much as 16 percentage 
points below those in the recent study, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The district normally determines its dropout rate by comparing enrollment in 
early May with enrollment the following October, Norton said. Although student 
transfer requests between those two periods are discounted, other factors are 
not taken into account, causing the dropout rate to appear small, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norton said that, because the state Department of Education uses the figures in 
a variety of reports and comparisons, district officials decided to embark on a 
study that would provide more accurate results. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there is a credibility gap between the two studies," Norton said. "But 
now we know exactly where we stand." 
</P>
<P>
Norton, director of alternative programs in the district, is also principal of 
Vail Continuation High School, which provides intensive counseling and tutoring 
to students on the verge of dropping out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new study did not address why students drop out, Norton said, most 
leave because they are disenchanted with the school system. A significant 
number of dropouts, he added, are pregnant teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
The largest number of dropouts occurred in the 10th grade, the study showed. 
Norton said he could offer no explanation why students left then. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 51 school districts in the county, Montebello Unified has one of the 
lowest dropout rates, according to a recently published booklet by the Los 
Angeles County Office of Education, which lists dropout rates that have been 
calculated by the conventional method. 
</P>
<P>
Under the conventional reporting system, Montebello's 4.4% dropout rate for the 
1987-88 school year was lower than that of any surrounding district. Los 
Angeles Unified, the largest district in the county, had a dropout rate of 14%, 
according to the county statistical manual. 
</P>
<P>
Dropout rates totaled 5.8% at Downey Unified, 5.7% at Alhambra Unified, 31.5% 
at El Rancho Unified, and 7.5% at Whittier Union High School District, 
according to the booklet. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we are doing a better job than other districts," Montebello Supt. John 
P. Cook said. "But we can do better." 
</P>
<P>
Norton has listed 11 recommendations to help lower the district dropout rate. 
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
School officials need to "formally identify" at-risk students in the second and 
third grades and "establish a mechanism for tracking and counseling those 
students (into) high school." Norton told the board that students who tend to 
drop out of high school often exhibit signs at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
Schools should re-examine "schoolwide policies and rules in order to identify 
any which may place students in the position of being forced out of school" by 
inflexible rules. Norton said he has encountered students who were kicked out 
of school because of a "rule that was enforced wrongly." 
</P>
<P>
Some rules, such as loss of credit for tardiness, can "really turn kids off 
from school," Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
The district should create programs aimed at preparing students to return to 
regular high school classes, one of the best ways to increase self-confidence 
in learning, Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
All at-risk students should be allowed to complete a fifth year of high school 
if they have been attending that school in their fourth year. Under current 
rules, most students are required to enroll in adult education programs after 
four years in high school. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Darline P. Robles, assistant superintendent for pupil and 
community services, said a 33-member committee will meet several times to 
discuss the recommendations before suggesting new programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just sit back and say that, 'Fine, we have a head full of numbers.' 
We have to do something about lowering the dropout rate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DROPOUT RATES 
</P>
<P>
A district study of 2,324 students over the past three years found these 
dropout totals, which do not include students who transferred to Vail High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens High School: 27.3% 
</P>
<P>
Montebello High School: 20.7% 
</P>
<P>
Schurr High School: 20.3% 
</P>
<P>
Montebello Unified: 22.9%

SUPERVISORS VOTE TO ARM WELFARE INVESTIGATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNA GOWENLOCK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County supervisors voted this week to allow the county's welfare 
investigators to carry guns on a job that they say has grown increasingly 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Social Services Agency hopes to have the welfare officers armed in 
July, said agency Director James Isom after the board unanimously voted Tuesday 
to equip the county's 14 investigators with guns if they meet the agency's 
safety and proficiency requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Jim Dougherty said he supported the agency's request because of a 
public perception that welfare investigators are law-enforcement officials and 
because of the investigators' past experience as police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Isom, who has supervised the county's welfare investigators for 14 years, said 
the request for side arms is nothing new, but several recent incidents 
involving investigators finally spurred his push for guns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Last-Ditch Chance' 
</P>
<P>
"I thought rather than wait until someone gets hurt or killed to give them a 
last-ditch chance for protection," Isom said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators, who try to track down suspected welfare cheats, say they 
have had some close scrapes. They have reported threats and assaults. One 
complained that he was nearly run down by a four-wheel-drive truck. Others 
report seeing weapons in the houses they enter for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to categorize all welfare recipients as criminals," Isom said. "I 
don't know why, but there seems to be more criminal behavior than there was 
before. We're not talking necessarily about the recipients themselves, but some 
of the people who may associate with them." 
</P>
<P>
Isom said the welfare investigators, 12 of whom are retired police officers, 
must pass rigid proficiency and safety tests and attend a course on the legal 
aspects of using deadly force before the agency will issue the weapons. The 
investigators will then be required to attend regular follow-up sessions, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleased by Decision 
</P>
<P>
Mike Skaggs, president of the Union of Peace Officer of Ventura County, which 
represents the welfare investigators, was elated by the decision. Skaggs, a 
welfare investigator himself, said that with only a radio for protection, 
investigators often feel unsafe on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend about seven hours a day in the field and contact a lot of people. A 
radio may not always be enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles welfare-fraud investigators working with the Department of Public 
Social Services do not carry guns, according to a department spokesman. But, he 
said, welfare investigators in the district attorney's office do carry guns and 
handle potentially more dangerous situations, such as serving search warrants 
to suspected violators.

THEATER CENTER RENEWS SPIRIT OF DEDICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, the board of directors of the Santa Paula Theater Center accepted 
with the deepest of regrets the resignation of William Lucking. As a co-founder 
and co-artistic director of the SPTC, we applaud his efforts and salute his 
contributions for helping to make it one of the most lauded and popular 
theaters in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a dream in the minds of both Bill and Dana Elcar has materialized 
into a theater of quality work structured on the sound foundation of first-rate 
talent and productions. 
</P>
<P>
While we will miss Bill's involvement and wish him well in his new endeavors, 
under Dana's guidance, the SPTC will remain a testament to the lofty ideals 
they set together. It will continue to represent the idea they foresaw and 
reflect the excellence their professionalism demanded. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the board, I wish to assure our patrons that the directors have 
renewed their spirit of dedication to the theater created by Bill and Dana. The 
SPTC will continue to present outstanding and exciting works in the county's 
most beautiful and historical setting.

LOGGER TEACHES FIREFIGHTERS THE HAZARDOUS ART OF 'TREE FALLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anybody can cut down a tree, says logger Douglas Dent. Start hacking a wedge 
out of the side of the trunk and, as sure as rain falling from the clouds, the 
tree will come down. But try laying a 100-foot ponderosa pine out along a 
narrow clearing, veering from power lines, staying away from healthy trees and 
not injuring yourself. That's complicated, says the wiry Oregonian. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems awful simple but, heck, I've been doing this for 20 years, and I'm 
just beginning to understand what it's all about," said Dent, a tree-cutting 
expert who has traveled to several continents teaching the hazardous art of 
"tree falling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teaching Firefighters 
</P>
<P>
Dent, the author of a manual for professional timber men, was at Crystal Lake 
on Tuesday, 6,000 feet above Azusa in the San Gabriel National Forest, teaching 
his craft to 14 firefighters for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you're cutting eucalyptus in Australia, banyans in South America or 
ponderosas here, the principles are the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards of tree chopping became vividly apparent two years ago, Forest 
Service officials say, when an engine foreman was killed on the fire line in 
Stanislaus National Forest. A tree he was downing snagged another tree, which 
snapped back and landed on him, killing him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Incidents 
</P>
<P>
"In my career, there were times when I was taking down between 50 and 100 trees 
a year," said Gordon Rowley, acting fire manager for the San Gabriel National 
Forest. "Every once in while, something happens that's unexpected to me." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the trainees were fire engine foremen or assistant foremen who will 
take their newly acquired skills back to their units and teach them to others. 
</P>
<P>
Dent, 42, a short, bouncy man in faded jeans, a checkerboard wool shirt and a 
tin helmet, agrees that trees are as peculiarly individualistic as humans. But 
accidents like the fatality two years ago can be avoided, with some training, 
he says. "Experience is a great teacher, provided you live through it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the trainees stepped up to designated trees and took their turn. 
These were big ponderosas, dead or mortally ill, lightning-struck or 
beetle-infested. "Hazard trees," Karen Fortus, the Mt. Baldy District resource 
officer, called them. "We get some pretty gusty winds up here, which could 
knock them down." 
</P>
<P>
In its simplest form, tree falling involves slicing a pie wedge, or "undercut," 
out of the side of the trunk with a 36-inch chain saw, then attacking the other 
side with wedges and tipping the trunk into the sliced opening. "The undercut 
is like the sights on a rifle," guiding the trajectory of the falling tree, 
Dent said. 
</P>
<P>
But there are always complications, he said as he sized up a 100-footer. A tree 
can have rotten wood, or it can lean in one direction, both of which have to be 
compensated for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the lean?" he asked his students, peering along the line of the trunk, 
encouraging some discussion. "Where's the best place to dump it?" 
</P>
<P>
Dent is a plain-spoken man, gently needling his students, quietly offering them 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tapping the Trunk 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see what it sounds like," he said to Patrick Williams, an assistant 
engine foreman in the forest's Chilao Station, who circles his tree, tapping 
the trunk with the back of an ax. ("A nice solid sound," explained a colleague, 
who had already downed his own tree, "means good wood. A thump means you got 
dried wood.") 
</P>
<P>
Williams sliced into the big tree, sending chips and fragrant sawdust flying. 
His challenge was to avoid some power lines nearby and a stand of majestic old 
trees. When he paused for a moment, Dent gave his undercut a critical look, 
sighting along the handle of the chain saw toward a clearing in the forest. "I 
think you can go a little deeper," he said, "but the angle of the dangle looks 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
After 30 minutes of sawing and sighting, the old tree crashes down. "The tree 
went just where you wanted it to go," said the logging expert. "Isn't that 
wonderful?" 
</P>
<P>
Dent says the greatest hazard in "cutting the big uglies" is misunderstanding 
the dynamics of the cuts. "If you get those pie wedges crossing each other, the 
trunk can split right to the top," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Armstrong, an assistant foreman in the national forest's Saugus District, 
pulled out a copy of Dent's book and pointed to an illustration of the "barber 
chair," when one slice is undermined by another, splitting the tree vertically, 
sending a piece of the trunk backwards. "You don't want to be standing behind 
it when that happens," Armstrong said. "It'll take your head off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Thrill 
</P>
<P>
But successfully dispatching a big one is a thrill. Seeing a big ponderosa go 
down where you want gives you "an adrenaline rush," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
You begin to understand why at the end of the day. Dan Smith, foreman at the 
forest's Redbox Station, is tussling with the day's biggest target -- a dead 
120-foot ponderosa, with some spindly branches near the top and a corkscrew 
lightning scar around its trunk, on the edge of the Crystal Lake picnic 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Lightning will literally cook a tree," Dent said. "That's what kills it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith must lay the trunk along a narrow alley between a paved road and a picnic 
table. But the equipment isn't cooperating. His saw has a fit of "altitude 
sickness," pumping weakly in the thin mountain air, and then its chain hits a 
nail, embedded there long ago by a camper. With a new saw, Smith cuts into a 
wedge of rotten wood, being careful to keep the sound wood at the corners of 
his undercut. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's a deep, resonant cracking sound, then another one and the top 
of the big tree starts to move in slow motion. Smith turns off his saw, 
carefully pulls a pair of wedges out of the widening slice in the trunk and 
steps back. He turns to watch the tree, about 30 tons of lumber, smash into the 
ground with a ferocious thump, shaking the earth and raising a cloud of dust. 
</P>
<P>
Smith expresses himself in the spare style of the experienced woodsman. "It's 
kind of gratifying to see it go where it's supposed to," he said.

ARCHER SETS HER SIGHTS ON '92 OLYMPIC GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER 12 YEARS, JANET DYKMAN GETS NEW BOW, NEW COACH AND URGE TO COMPETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When she first competed as a teen-age archer while attending Arroyo High School 
of El Monte, Janet Dykman displayed flashes of promise. 
</P>
<P>
Dykman was talented enough to earn a berth in the Junior Olympic Archery 
Development program and place high in numerous state and local tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
But shortly after graduating from high school in 1972, Dykman left the sport. 
</P>
<P>
But from time to time over the next 12 years, Dykman said, she thought about 
returning. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while I'd go back to it but I'd talk myself out of staying," 
she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
It was while she was a spectator at the archery competition for the 1984 Summer 
Olympics at El Dorado Park in Long Beach that Dykman finally decided to return. 
</P>
<P>
"I got there and saw all the men and women competing and how archery had 
developed over the years and I decided to get back," she said. "I was watching 
them and I said to myself, 'I can do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Since her return, Dykman has demonstrated that point to her opponents. Last 
month, the 35-year-old El Monte native finished fourth in qualifying for the 
1989 World Archery Target Championships July 2-9 in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
She also qualified for the U.S. Olympic Sports Festival from July 18-27 in 
Oklahoma City, finishing fifth with a score of 1,233 points (out of a possible 
1,440) in the West team trials in May. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, she has produced a high score of 1,266. The only woman 
from the U.S. to surpass the 1,300 barrier in the last year is Utah's Denise 
Parker with 1,314. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dykman has been making steady progress toward the 1992 Summer 
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain -- progress that Dykman says she could have 
scarcely imagined when she first entertained thoughts of resuming the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out at home with my first bow just to see if I could still do it and 
then I went out and got a new one," Dykman said. 
</P>
<P>
When she finally started competing again, Dykman found that her aim was as 
accurate as ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I found my new bow in November or December (of 1984) and I went to (a 
tournament in) Las Vegas in January and found it was still there," she said. 
"It took me a few shots but I had a good idea (about strategy) and I was 
grouping real well." 
</P>
<P>
What she also realized was that the sport had changed considerably. 
</P>
<P>
"When I stopped competing (in 1972) I was still shooting a one-piece wooden 
bow. Now they use mostly magnesium alloys," she said. "It has just advanced so 
much since then." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, she said, that is what stopped her from returning to archery sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a challenge to adapt to the rules for adults and the distances and what 
you could and couldn't have with your bows," Dykman said. "That was a reason 
why I left. It (the sport) went through a lot of changes and I think it would 
have been hard to compete at that time. 
</P>
<P>
She never doubted, however, that she could adjust. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the basic ability was there all along," Dykman said. "The main problem 
with taking a long break is the muscles you use. Getting in the right condition 
to work the weight (of the bows and equipment) was important." 
</P>
<P>
Dykman improved so much that she qualified for the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team 
trials and had hopes of making the team for the Summer Olympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
But she struggled to a distant 23rd and left the trials disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"My original goal was for '92 and then things were going so well that I figured 
I would go for '88," she said. "You go there trying to make it and you're 
disappointed when you don't." 
</P>
<P>
That was before she started training under Coach Larry Noriega of Hacienda 
Heights about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We met when we were shooting at the indoor lanes" in Monrovia, he remembered. 
"When I first saw her I could see that she had potential but I also knew she 
had some problems we had to work with. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she had to know her equipment. She had to know the basics . . . so that 
if it did break in a competition, she could fix it. She had that fear before 
when she competed. Now she doesn't have that problem." 
</P>
<P>
Dykman was surprised at how how fast she improved in competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Immediately after I started working with Larry, I noticed improvement," she 
said. "He's got me in tune with myself and my equipment. Now I know what I can 
do and I know what I have to do to get there. 
</P>
<P>
"To me the major thing was to change my shooting form. I was shooting well 
before but I wasn't getting it down there as consistently as before. Knowing 
the equipment has helped, too. I'm thinking more about the overall picture." 
</P>
<P>
For Dykman, the overall picture has included staying in top condition. That's 
important, given the weight that an archer must carry during a typical 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"She's shooting with close to 40 pounds now and just picture a person doing 
that 144 times" in a typical tournament, Noriega said. 
</P>
<P>
Dykman's daily workout schedule includes aerobics, lifting weights and bicycle 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started with it, I thought, 'Why do I need to lift weights?' But 
now I look at it differently. . . . I knew it was good for you but I didn't 
realize how important it was for leg strength when you stand in one place for a 
while. Plus I think it builds confidence because you feel good about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
It was this new-found confidence that Dykman said she felt during the world 
trials in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to Atlanta, I felt like I was one of them," she said. "(Before) I 
would tell myself I was but by the time I got there I wasn't. Now I feel like I 
have more skills and I'm a more important part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Dykman said that the most difficult part about returning to competition at 
first was juggling archery with her work schedule. When she started competing 
again, Dykman was working 60 to 70 hours a week as a manager at a ceramic 
production plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I practically lived at that job and I liked it but it was time-consuming," she 
said. It was so demanding that Dykman finally left her job and moved back home 
with her parents in El Monte so she could train full time for the 1988 Summer 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to defray her expenses, she has lived with her parents the last two 
years. Not the easiest decision for a 35-year-old to make but Dykman didn't 
feel as if she had a choice. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a have-to situation," she said. "It was difficult living under that 
structured environment again. But it was getting pretty expensive to pay my 
rent and my bills and still compete." 
</P>
<P>
Dykman said moving home was just as difficult on her parents, Greta and 
Cornelis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was kind of rough on my parents when I decided to leave and then 
when I decided to come home but they've been very supportive of me and my 
goals," she said. "I think they felt a little better once they saw me attaining 
some of my goals." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, Dykman has been working part time at a door and window 
company in South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very willing and supportive of my goals in this sport," she said. 
"When I need time off for tournaments, I just mark it off on my calendar. It's 
a fantastic job." 
</P>
<P>
But even though she lives at home and has a job that fits into her training and 
tournament schedule, she said staying afloat financially is difficult. She said 
she has a trust fund at the National Archery Assn. in Colorado Springs but that 
covers only a small portion of her expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"You're an amateur, so you have to pay your own way most of the time," she 
said. "Once you make the world team they pay your expenses. But it's getting 
there that's difficult financially." 
</P>
<P>
Dykman said finances will probably dictate how long she remains in the sport 
after the 1992 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Finances aside, the future would appear to be bright for Dykman. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega said he has watched Dykman improve steadily since he started coaching 
her and has high hopes for her near future. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to get her to break that 1,300 score," he said. "Once we get that I 
think we'll be over the top." 
</P>
<P>
Dykman believes she is taking the proper course toward making it to the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing it the right way this time," she said. "I came back with the 
right people and the right organization. I am also using the right style." 
</P>
<P>
She hopes that will make all the difference between competing in the Olympics 
and watching from the sidelines.

ALL-STAR TEAM COLLECTS 15 HITS IN 13-10 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A team of Ventura County all-star baseball players outslugged a similar team 
from the Westside, 13-10, Sunday at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County had 15 hits, including three by Buena's Tom Lunsford, who hit a 
two-run home run in the first inning and finished with four runs batted in. Rio 
Mesa's Steve Soliz delivered a key blow in the fifth inning, blasting a 
three-run double to give Ventura County a 6-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County snapped a 7-7 tie with six runs in the eighth. Lunsford, Simi 
Valley's Terry Hill and Jesse Anguiano, Royal's Jason Jones and Westlake's 
Derek Tamburro each had run-scoring singles in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Five Ventura County pitchers issued 14 walks, but Camarillo's Steve Biggs went 
the final 2 2/3 innings to earn the victory. Biggs was also the winning pitcher 
last week for the South in the Ventura County All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded and one out in the third, Rio Mesa's Jon Rust replaced 
starter Rich Langford of Simi Valley and struck out two batters in a row. 
Jones, the center fielder, made several fine defensive plays.

ENTREPRENEUR CASTS LOT WITH SPORTFISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skipper Andy Volaski grew seasick watching Ventura Landing Sportfishing try to 
stay afloat in a very competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
Volaski, 54, had been operating fishing boats out of the landing for 17 years 
and had worked for four different owners. 
</P>
<P>
After the last owner went bankrupt and left Ventura without commercial fishing 
for 2 1/2 months, Volaski decided to run the business himself. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had a good following," Volaski said. "I've been fishing in these 
waters for a long time and I have a few favorite spots. I try not to let any of 
my customers go home empty-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Business, however, has been slow. Few people know about the landing because 
there has been little advertising. In order to make a reservation, you have to 
call Volaski at home because his boathouse is currently under construction. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, it's been a Mickey Mouse operation," Volaski said. "We should have 
new facilities and new docks by the end of the week." 
</P>
<P>
Volaski's boat is called the Sea Angler Sportfisher and leaves for 
three-quarter-day runs every morning except Wednesday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
There is also twilight fishing on Wednesday through Saturday from 5:30 to 10:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be switching to surface fishing from rock codding," Volaski said. "Right 
now, we're getting some halibut, bass and barracuda. The fishing will really 
get good as soon as the waters warm up." 
</P>
<P>
The landing is located at 1500 Anchors Way in Ventura Harbor. For reservations: 
805-646-3590. 
</P>
<P>
Stroke of luck: Jeff Richards, a professional painter, has changes partners as 
often as paint cans, but it hasn't affected his luck on the Ventura County 
Grand Prix tour. 
</P>
<P>
Richards has won two tournaments and twice reached the semifinals in five 
events while competing in the Men's A doubles bracket. 
</P>
<P>
He leads the division with 140 points. Phil Ranger, the former tennis pro at 
Cabrillo Racquet Club, is second with 70. 
</P>
<P>
Next stop on the tour is this weekend at the Oakridge Racquet Club Tournament 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Heading home: Chris Hantgin, former Ventura High basketball standout, is 
transferring to Ventura College after attending Gonzaga University in Spokane, 
Washington for one year. 
</P>
<P>
Hantgin, a forward, red-shirted his freshman year with the Bulldogs and will 
join the Pirates as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Bayou Bound?: Ventura College pitcher Shane Espitia will visit Nicholls State 
University in Thibodaux, La., this weekend before deciding where he will 
continue his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
Espitia posted an 8-3 record and 2.86 earned-run average last season for the 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Espitia is also considering Cal Lutheran, Azusa Pacific, Cal State Sacramento, 
Sonoma State, and San Francisco State. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis professionals appointed: Dave Dike of Santa Paula will become the new 
professional at the Moranda Park in Port Hueneme. Dike formerly coached the 
men's team at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Dave McKinney, who recently moved from Kohler, Wis., has been appointed 
director of tennis and head professional at Cabrillo Racquet Club in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Junior tennis: The Cabrillo Racquet will enter three teams in the State 
Championships for junior team tennis on August 26 and 27 at the Sierra Club in 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
There will be six teams representing each Northern California and Southern 
California in a competition known as the Gar Glenney Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The Boys 15 and under team features Darren Potkey, who competed as a freshman 
for Ventura high. The top two players on the boys 12 and under team are twins 
Mike and Bob Bryan of Camarillo. The top player on the girls 12 and under team 
is Jessica Improta of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
These three teams qualified for the state tournament by winning the junior team 
tennis playoffs June 10 and 11 at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Junior team tennis has 255 teams from Bakersfield to San Diego with 1,800 
youngsters participating.

TASK FORCE TAKES FIRST STEP TO TRY TO END SPOUSE ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She was remembering. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time he beat her was before they were married. They were in 
Glendale, and he was drunk. After he had knocked her to the ground, people 
rushed over to help her up. He went for a walk around the block, to cool off. 
Later, he cried and told her he was sorry. She believed him. She felt sorry for 
him. She forgot about her black eye and about her bleeding ear. Shortly 
afterward, they were married. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Kramer, a former Los Angeles housewife on welfare, on Wednesday was 
sharing with nearly 100 San Diego politicians, dignitaries, police chiefs and 
civic leaders her world of domestic violence, and they were listening. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only a beginning, but it's a beginning of the end of this violence. 
May we all work together until home is sanctuary for every family member," she 
told them. It was exactly what they wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
This was the kickoff meeting of the San Diego County Domestic Violence Task 
Force, a newly formed conglomeration of civic leaders, police, lawyers, 
doctors, social workers, counselors and former victims that will try to help 
battered and battering spouses help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Members have something in common. Through different venues, each tries to help 
victims of spousal abuse and reform the abusers. That's not an easy job. Last 
year, more than 15,000 cases of domestic violence were reported to the city's 
law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But before they can be effective, community and legal agencies must first get 
their own act together, representatives say. The purpose of the task force, 
then, is to repair the system. 
</P>
<P>
"We still need to find a better way of (stopping domestic violence). There are 
too many men and women falling through the cracks," said Ashley Walker-Hooper, 
a director of the YWCA's Battered Women's Services program, which she founded 
in 1978. "Most women have to have intervention by the system. They can't get 
out on their own. But you've got to have a system that cares and works 
effectively." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coordination Lacking 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not lack of concern or effort, but little coordination and 
communication between shelters, counselors and the legal system, task force 
members say. The most difficult step a battered woman has to take is reporting 
the violence, either to police or a shelter. But once within the system, they 
may face confusing paper work, changing policies and bureaucratic runaround. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the lack of coordination among victims' resources may continue the 
problem as much as victims' reluctance to report it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are resources for victims, but they are scattered, and not as efficient 
as they should be," said Walker-Hooper. "We need to find out how we can 
systematically help each other." 
</P>
<P>
It would be one of three times Kramer would be hospitalized from the attacks. 
It seemed her husband always beat her after he had been drinking. One night, 
she and a girlfriend picked him up at a bar, because his friends wouldn't let 
him drive drunk. As she drove home, he began to spit on her and slug her. And 
when they arrived in front of their house, he dragged her from the car and beat 
her until she was unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Founders of the task force say their main goal is to improve and make 
consistent the response to domestic violence cases countywide by integrating 
community and law enforcement services. So when representatives of as many as 
60 agencies meet each month for the next two years, they will share 
information, question one another's counseling procedures, criticize their own 
methods and try to develop standards for the system. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, organizers say, members hope to introduce legislation and influence 
city and county budget decisions about resources for victims and abusers. 
</P>
<P>
But the broad makeup of the task force, with input coming from as many as 80 
people, may present the group's biggest obstacle: avoiding the bureaucracy and 
lack of coordination that prompted its formation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenge Seen 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a challenge. We could get lost in all of it," said Joyce Faidley, 
director of family violence prevention at the Center for Women's Studies and 
Services. "But I think it will work if we keep our eye on victims' rights and 
victims' stories." 
</P>
<P>
Casey Gwinn, a founder of the task force and head of the city attorney's child 
abuse and domestic violence unit, was more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't make progress toward a systematic, integrated response to county 
domestic violence now, then we never will," said Gwinn, who has handled 
spousal-abuse cases for three years. "We have the policy makers at the top 
committed to supporting the task force, and we have agencies who directly serve 
the victims committed to working on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll ever be very far away from the victims, or from the 
victims' perspective," said Gwinn. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, they were close to Pamela Kramer, who had spent 14 years in an 
abusive marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of breaking her ribs, nose and front teeth, her husband finally 
agreed to see a psychiatrist. It didn't help. The doctor told him it was 
permissible to show some control over his wife. The beatings continued, until 
she tried to kill herself. She survived the drug overdose -- and went back to 
her husband for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer, after counseling and help from the system, finally left her husband 
and divorced him. Today, she is head of the Los Angeles city attorney's 
victim-advocate program, which helps the courts screen and process domestic 
violence cases. She also is remarried. 
</P>
<P>
"This task force can work, because all of the people here will spread the word 
to their friends, neighbors, boyfriends and girlfriends. They'll spread the 
word everywhere," said Kramer. "If they learn how to work together, they can 
stop the cycle of violence."

JURY FINDS LUCAS GUILTY IN THREE SLASHER SLAYINGS; 
</P>
<P>
BUT PANEL DEADLOCKS ON TWO OTHER MURDER COUNTS AND FINDS HIM NOT GUILTY OF 
STILL ANOTHER KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After eight days of deliberations, a jury convicted carpet cleaner David Lucas 
Wednesday in the throat-slash murders of three people and the attempted murder 
of another. The panel deadlocked on two other murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of six men and six women who convicted Lucas, 33, of Spring Valley 
found that the multiple murders were committed with special circumstance, which 
could result in a death sentence for Lucas, who has been in custody in San 
Diego County Jail since December, 1984. The jurors will return next month to 
deliberate on the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors' decision follows a 56-day trial that began on Jan. 3, making it one 
of the longest criminal trials in San Diego history. Prosecutors and defense 
attorneys began jury selection last August. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sign of Emotion 
</P>
<P>
Lucas sat impassively while the verdicts were announced and showed no signs of 
emotion. While waiting for the jury to enter, Lucas spent the time smiling and 
talking to his attorneys. He never acknowledged his family, who sat in the 
front row behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1979 deaths of Suzanne 
Jacobs, 31, her son, Colin, 3, and the 1984 death of Anne Catherine Swanke, 22. 
Jacobs and her son were found in their Normal Heights home with their throats 
slashed. Swanke, a San Diego State University student, also had her throat 
slashed and her body was found on a remote hillside in Spring Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also convicted Lucas in the attempted murder of Jody Santiago 
Robertson. Robertson, a Seattle woman, survived a June 9, 1984, attack by 
Lucas, who choked her and slashed her throat. Lucas was also convicted of 
kidnaping Robertson, who testified for the prosecution at the trial, and of 
kidnaping Swanke. 
</P>
<P>
In each of the kidnaping and attempted murder convictions, the jury found that 
Lucas used a deadly weapon and inflicted great bodily injury. Theoretically, 
the findings could lead to stiffer penalties for Lucas on the convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was acquitted in the death of Gayle Roberta Garcia, a Pt. Loma realtor 
who was found with her throat slashed in a vacant Spring Valley house on Dec. 
8, 1981. Jurors were unable to convict Lucas for the deaths of Rhonda Strang, 
24, and Amber Fisher, 3, both of Lakeside. Strang was baby-sitting the child 
when their throats were slashed on Oct. 23, 1984. The jury foreman told 
Superior Court Judge Laura Hammes that after taking four or five votes the jury 
was deadlocked 11 to 1 for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possibility of Gas Chamber 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who now faces the possibility of dying in California's gas chamber, had 
already served a four-year sentence at the California Youth Authority for the 
1973 rape of a young woman. The woman was abducted and taken to Cowles 
Mountain, where Lucas raped her and used a knife to cut her hands and throat, 
but she survived the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Williams declined to comment after the verdicts were 
announced. Defense attorneys Alex Landon and Steve Feldman also walked out of 
the courtroom and brushed past reporters. "There's nothing we can say right 
now," Feldman said brusquely. 
</P>
<P>
John Swanke, father of Lucas' last victim, Anne Swanke, noted that Lucas' 
convictions came almost four years and seven months after his daughter was 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very, very pleased . . . It was the only verdict they could have come up 
with," said Swanke. "I'm pleased that they got it through and we're now done 
with the trial." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' family, which consisted of his mother, sister and others, walked out of 
the courtroom without talking to the media. While John Swanke was facing 
television cameras, one of Lucas' relatives stood at the far end of the long 
hallway, dabbing at her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the attorneys' refusal to comment, it was not known Wednesday if the 
prosecution will choose to retry Lucas for the killings of Strang and Amber 
Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
There was some confusion when the clerk read the verdicts out loud. Some of the 
counts were juxtaposed and the judge ordered him to read the verdicts again. 
Defense attorneys asked that each juror be polled after the reading of each 
count, but waived the polling on the not guilty finding in the death of Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday marked the beginning of the end for an era that saw three notorious 
murderers incarcerated at the downtown County Jail at the same time. Lucas was 
the last of the killers to be brought to trial. Kevin Cooper, whose trial was 
moved here from San Bernardino in October, 1984, was convicted in 1985 in the 
stabbing deaths of four people. Joselito Cinco was arrested in September, 1984, 
and convicted in 1988 in the slayings of two San Diego Police officers and the 
attempted murder of another. 
</P>
<P>
Both Cooper and Cinco were already in the County Jail when Lucas was arrested 
in December, 1984.

SDG&amp;E MERGER OPPONENTS FILE AD COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Local opponents of the proposed merger between San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and 
Southern California Edison accused the companies of deception in their 
$1.5-million advertising campaign supporting the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to derail the advertising campaign, the Utility Consumer Action Network 
and the Coalition for Local Control filed complaints Wednesday with the state 
attorney general, the district attorney and the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The letters ask officials to seek civil and criminal penalties against the 
utilities, as well as a court injunction halting the "despicably false and 
misleading" radio, TV and newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the controversial merger proposal, which would create the largest 
privately owned utility in the nation, is in the hands of state and federal 
regulators. But opponents say the ads could affect public comment to the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as well as state Public Utilities 
Commission proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Isuzu would be a little embarrassed to repeat (the utility commercials) on 
the air," CLC Executive Director Bob Hudson said at a news conference 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Clearly Face Opposition' 
</P>
<P>
"If a used-car dealer made the kind of blanket, unsupported claims found in 
these recent SDG&amp;E/Edison ads, they would clearly face prosecution," CLC 
attorney Dan Stanford said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
Merger opponents object to the commercials that promise residential customers 
annual savings of $50. UCAN Executive Director Michael Shames said the annual 
savings for a typical residential customer would amount to $6 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Shames and Hudson said the ads also fail to state that annual savings are 
guaranteed by the utility shareholders only until 1993. The ads mention the $50 
annual savings, then refer to a total cost reduction of $1.7 billion through 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E Chairman Thomas Page is apparently among those confused by the flurry 
of numbers. In a June 15 interview with radio station KSDO, Page maintained 
that residents would save $50 annually for 11 years. When the interviewer again 
asked if that was true, Page replied, "Well, I hope it is," according to a 
program transcript supplied by merger opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Page subsequently issued a retraction that aired on KSDO, said SDG&amp;E 
spokesman David S. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Utility executives denied that their ads are deceptive and said the campaign is 
designed to educate consumers about the details of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Public Utilities Commission filing was 8 inches thick," said Ed Guiles, 
SDG&amp;E director of merger transition. "We are trying to take a complex 
subject and distill it into English so people can understand." 
</P>
<P>
The complaints "say to me that these ads have been extremely effective," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Obvious Grandstanding' 
</P>
<P>
SCE spokeswoman Diane Wittenberg called the protests "groundless" and "obvious 
grandstanding." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Atty. John Witt said he referred the utility advertising issue 
to the district attorney's office for possible action last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Given our participation in the regulatory proceedings, it would not have been 
appropriate for this office to handle the case," he said. Witt called the 
advertisements "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Acting on Witt's request, the fraud unit of the district attorney's office 
asked SCE to back up the assertions it made in a Feb. 28 newspaper ad, 
according to office spokesman Stephen Casey. The ad quoted "independent 
experts" in arguing that the merger would cut energy costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edison refused to provide the information because the ads amounted to corporate 
free speech on a public issue, Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Unusual Complaint' 
</P>
<P>
Casey said no decision has been made on further action in the case. He was not 
immediately aware of the latest UCAN/CLC filing. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office usually handles complaints by defrauded 
consumers, office spokesman Alan Ashby said. "It's an unusual complaint," he 
said of the merger opponents' filing. 
</P>
<P>
But CLC attorney Stanford said there is no need to show a specific victim of 
the ad campaign, only an attempt to mislead the public. 
</P>
<P>
The ad campaign, paid for exclusively by utility shareholders, has already cost 
$1 million. Smith said another $500,000 has been earmarked for advertising 
through the end of regulatory hearings.

HOLLYWOOD SIGN HAS ITS MONEY RETURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has restored $46,529 to a trust fund set up 
to maintain the landmark Hollywood Sign, acknowledging that the money was used 
improperly to cover the chamber's own operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened should not have happened, and by taking this action we hope to 
wipe the slate clean," said Larry Kaplan, the chamber's president and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kaplan said the chamber's executive board had not decided whether to 
repay an estimated $45,000 in interest forfeited by the Hollywood Sign Trust 
during the 10 years that money from the trust was on loan to the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something we're having our lawyers and accountants look into, and we 
don't expect to reach a final decision on that for another couple of weeks," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said the chamber borrowed $53,158 from the trust fund in 1979 and 
1981, Kaplan said the $46,529 repayment, made last Friday, "reflects the fact 
that the trust also owed the chamber some money." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, community activists critical of the chamber's handling of the 
transaction called for the interest to be repaid immediately, and said they 
intend to ask the state attorney general's office to conduct an audit of the 
chamber's finances. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked to read they had used the money from the trust for their own 
purposes, and I find it unbelievable that they would now hesitate to repay the 
interest," said Ed Cohan, a lawyer representing three homeowner groups at odds 
with the chamber over the sign. "I'd like to know who else can borrow money 
interest-free." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, The Times disclosed that of $122,166 in assets reported by chamber 
officials last year as belonging to the trust fund, $53,158 had been on loan to 
the chamber for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
The famous sign atop Mt. Lee is under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles 
Department of Recreation and Parks. But by agreement with the city, the chamber 
has been responsible for its upkeep since 1978, after raising nearly $300,000 
to save it from demolition. 
</P>
<P>
The trust fund was established in 1978 as part of the fund-raising effort. 
About $214,000 of the almost $300,000 placed in the fund was spent that year to 
rebuild the sign. The rest was to be held in the trust fund to maintain the 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the trust's tax-exempt status, chamber officials agreed that the 
funds were to be used exclusively for the maintenance of the sign, and that the 
trust was "not to be affiliated with or controlled by the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce or any other organization." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$600 Spent on Sign 
</P>
<P>
However, federal and state records showed that as of the most recent filing 
period, ending last June, the trust had spent only about $600 for maintenance 
of the sign since the fund was created, and more than $3,300 on bank and 
accounting fees. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the latest developments, a Recreation and Parks official said 
this week his agency may want to "take another look" at its informal 
arrangement with the chamber over the sign's management. 
</P>
<P>
"From what's happened, I think a better form of documentation is needed," said 
Assistant General Manager Sheldon Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have now should probably be replaced with a binding agreement that 
clearly spells out what our responsibilities are, what theirs are, where the 
revenues come from, where they go and who authorizes them, those kinds of 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan confirmed earlier reports that the money borrowed from the fund was used 
to cover the chamber's operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dynamic, growing organization, but it hasn't always been that way. 
There have been some lean times, and the money was apparently used to get the 
chamber through some of those lean times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing Sinister' 
</P>
<P>
Saying he was "not going to apologize for things that happened in the past," 
Kaplan -- a former chief of staff to City Councilman Michael Woo who replaced 
Bill Welsh as head of the chamber last month -- insisted there was "nothing 
sinister" about the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of malfeasance on anyone's part. It's more a case of 
admittedly, to some extent, sloppy practices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal tax records indicated that the trust fund loaned $53,158 to 
the chamber in 1984, an accountant for the chamber said that the money was 
actually borrowed in two increments several years earlier.

<P>
One of the two men charged in the execution-style slaying of a Vista man 
pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to murder during the course of 
kidnaping and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Michael Holm, 20, of Fallbrook changed his plea to guilty just hours 
before the start of the trial of his co-defendant, Larry Wayne LaFleur, 22, of 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Holm admitted killing Otto Swan Bloomquist, 82, who was shot numerous times 
Jan. 10, apparently after he was kidnaped while waiting for his wife in the 
parking lot of a Carlsbad shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Holm will be sentenced Aug. 21, but sentencing rules governing murder committed 
during the commission of another felony almost ensure that he will be sentenced 
to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
While being questioned by U. S. District Judge William B. Enright, Holm said: 
"I pulled the trigger, sir." Holm also said he shot Bloomquist in the back of 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the victim's widow, Nora Bloomquist, 84, gave the first testimony in 
LaFleur's trial. 
</P>
<P>
She identified the couple's car from an enlarged photo as the one where she 
left her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"That is our car, only it's dirty. We never had a dirty car," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she told her husband she would be gone shopping only for an hour, and 
that Bloomquist said: "I'll be right here." 
</P>
<P>
When she returned, she said she found "no car, no Otto." 
</P>
<P>
The widow held up without crying until shown her husband's wallet and 
pocketknife, when she paused and bent forward in her chair. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys asked her no questions. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is being held in federal court because the victim's body was found on 
Camp Pendleton.

A 74-year-old woman died after a car driven by her husband ran a red light and 
collided with another vehicle in Kearny Mesa, police reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
After the Tuesday evening accident, Aliene Alta Nelson of Serra Mesa was taken 
to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where she died at 8 p.m, a spokesman for the 
coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when her husband, 70-year-old Ralph Nelson, ran a red 
light at Kearny Villa Road and Aero Drive and collided with a car crossing the 
intersection on a green light, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ralph Nelson nor Della Renee Henry, 26, the driver of the other car,

PANEL REJECTS SENIOR HOUSING IN BARTON HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a crucial decision that is likely to kill a controversial residential 
development, the Los Angeles City Council's Planning and Environment Committee 
Tuesday turned down a condominium and senior-citizen housing complex that had 
been proposed for the Barton Hill area of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the plan, which called for 100 condominiums and 68 rental units 
in which occupancy would be restricted to low- and moderate-income senior 
citizens, argued that it would provide much-needed housing for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposed development generated widespread criticism in San Pedro among 
residents who said its site -- too far from churches and the downtown business 
district and too close to busy Harbor Boulevard and the on-ramp to the Vincent 
Thomas Bridge -- is no place for senior citizens to live. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Like a Prison' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible location," resident Tony Marino told the committee. "If you'd 
see it yourself, you'd see it is just like a prison they're building there for 
seniors. . . . You're making a prison for them." 
</P>
<P>
Marino and about two dozen other opponents, many of them seniors and low-income 
residents of the Barton Hill area, made the 25-mile trip to downtown Los 
Angeles for Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
There they learned a basic lesson of city government: that the council member 
who represents a district usually gets his wish. And they found out that in the 
15th Council District, Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores usually does what she 
believes the majority of her constituents want. 
</P>
<P>
A Flores aide, citing the widespread opposition, asked the committee to reject 
the project at 515 Beacon St. 
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing that, Councilman Michael Woo said: "In deference to the 
councilwoman of the district, I will make a motion to oppose this project." His 
motion passed unanimously when Councilman Hal Bernson seconded it and voted in 
favor. The third committee member, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, did not attend 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Chance for Survival 
</P>
<P>
The proposal's only chance for survival at this point is if the City Council 
overturns the committee's decision. Both sides, however, agree that is 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
In casting their votes, Woo and Bernson said they hoped developers George and 
Michael Tumanjan of Torrance would propose the project for another site in San 
Pedro. But that was no comfort to the developers, who say they do not know what 
they will do with the three-acre Barton Hill site, at Beacon and 
OFarrellstreets, which they bought for $3.3 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The site is zoned for manufacturing; the developers had requested it be rezoned 
for medium-density residential development. Douglas Ring, a lawyer for the 
Tumanjans, said there is already vacant manufacturing space in the area and the 
market does not call for more to be built. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's terribly unfortunate," Ring said of the committee's vote. "I 
think the seniors just lost." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flores Is Praised 
</P>
<P>
Countered Howard Uller, executive director of Toberman Settlement House and a 
leader of the opposition: "I think that Mrs. Flores showed her willingness to 
listen to her constituents and I think she's to be commended for that. It just 
reinforces my belief in democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Uller and other community leaders, including the president of the San Pedro 
Peninsula Homeowners Coalition, had opposed the project on various grounds. In 
addition to saying the location is bad for senior citizens, they said the 
proposed rezoning would take away manufacturing space in a community that needs 
jobs, and that the condominium development might gentrify the Barton Hill 
neighborhood, squeezing out poor people and bringing in yuppies with children 
who would place a burden on area schools. 
</P>
<P>
They also complained that the developer was trying to get approval for 
condominiums "on the backs of senior citizens." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to combat that last criticism, Ring proposed a last-minute 
compromise Tuesday that would have allowed the committee to restrict ownership 
of the condominiums to senior citizens. Upon hearing that, Councilman Bernson 
sent the two sides outside to negotiate, but after a brief discussion on the 
steps of City Hall, the opponents decided the offer did not change their 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reverses Recommendation 
</P>
<P>
The committee's decision Tuesday reverses the recommendation of the Los Angeles 
Planning Commission, which in April reluctantly approved plans for the project. 
All four commissioners present at the April hearing said they did not like the 
location of the development, but three of the four voted in favor, saying the 
complex would help ease a shortage of housing for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In making his presentation to the committee, Ring relied heavily on that 
rationale. He told committee members that the Tumanjans' proposal, in which a 
private developer would build housing for low- to moderate-income people 
without help from the government, is exactly what city policies are intended to 
promote. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no ideal sites left," Ring said. "There just aren't any." He added 
that the council should be encouraging development on any site that will 
"provide housing for our future generations and our parents' generation." 
</P>
<P>
Flores aide Mario Juravich told the panel that nobody is opposed to senior 
citizen housing. "But I think it is the site itself that is being questioned."

CHAPTER ORGANIZES TO FIGHT MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beneath a wall poster proclaiming "No U.S. $$ for Death Squad Government in El 
Salvador," a national grass-roots group opposed to U.S. military aid to El 
Salvador's newly elected government founded a San Fernando Valley chapter in 
Van Nuys this week. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor to Neighbor, which claims 300 Valley members, drew about 100 residents 
to its organizational meeting at First Presbyterian Church on Monday. Its 
primary goal is to lobby Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who sits on 
both the House Foreign Affairs and Budget committees, to help lead the fight to 
cut off war-related funds to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard Berman is the kind of elected official who, once moved, can be 
enormously effective," said Fred Ross Jr., Neighbor to Neighbor's executive 
director, after addressing the Van Nuys gathering. "He has a real sense of 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News Conference 
</P>
<P>
Berman, who says he was a congressional leader on war-torn El Salvador long 
before he heard from Neighbor to Neighbor, joined other liberal Democrats on 
Wednesday at a Washington news conference with Jose Mazariego. Mazariego is a 
prominent Salvadoran labor leader who was detained by the Salvadoran Treasury 
Police last week hours after he received a visa to visit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At the behest of New York City labor leaders, Berman said he had helped 
Mazariego obtain the visa. After Mazariego was abducted in an unmarked car, 
Berman led a group of representatives in contacting State Department officials, 
who demanded the labor leader's safety and release, Ross said. Even as Vice 
President Dan Quayle was meeting with Salvadoran government leaders, Mazariego 
was tortured and had not been charged with an offense, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Jose Mazariego's ordeal signals the need for a new approach to El Salvador," 
Berman said in a prepared statement Wednesday. "The Administration must press 
the Salvadoran government to pursue a negotiated political solution to the 
civil war and to guarantee the expression of political pluralism vital to the 
integrity of democratic government." 
</P>
<P>
Berman said that the new Salvadoran government, headed by President Alfredo 
Cristiani, "is telling us that labor and other opposition groups will be 
harassed, that they will be threatened and that their leaders will be cruelly 
attacked." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party President 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani is a millionaire coffee grower who took over the presidency of the 
Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena party, in 1985 from Roberto 
d'Aubuisson, a former army major who has been linked to the activity of 
right-wing death squads. In a meeting with d'Aubuisson last week, Quayle 
emphasized the need for respect for human rights amid El Salvador's growing 
political violence. 
</P>
<P>
Although Berman maintained that Neighbor to Neighbor has not influenced his 
actions, he said in a telephone interview that the group plays a useful role in 
educating Americans about the violence in El Salvador -- which he pointedly 
said is perpetrated by left-wing guerrillas as well as by right-wing death 
squads. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't disagree with Neighbor to Neighbor's goals," said Berman, who 
represents much of the East Valley. "To end the civil war, to get a negotiated 
settlement and to end some of the outrageous conduct that parts of that 
government have engaged in in recent years. The question is, what's the best 
way to do it?" 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Berman said he does not support Neighbor to Neighbor's top 
legislative priority: passage of a bill sponsored by Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier 
(D-Wis.) to end all American military involvement in El Salvador. The group has 
deluged Berman's office with 1,367 letters urging him to back the measure and 
has vowed to solicit more letter writers at shopping centers and supermarkets 
until the number hits 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the Kastenmeier bill is even within the realm of what anybody 
is talking about here," Berman said. "It would constitute abandonment instead 
of a change in focus." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiated Settlement 
</P>
<P>
He said a more pragmatic approach would make aid to El Salvador conditional on 
a negotiated settlement of the civil war and increased respect for human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor to Neighbor was started in San Francisco in 1985. The next year it 
founded a lobbying office and a political action committee to support 
progressive political candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The organization initially focused on opposing aid to the Nicaraguan Contras 
and backing candidates who advocated that position. Ross and Marshall Ganz, 
both veteran Democratic political organizers and campaign consultants, helped 
coordinate get-out-the-vote efforts for U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) in 
his 1986 reelection bid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in a 1987 
special election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'88 Campaign 
</P>
<P>
They also dispatched members to campaign door to door in the 1988 congressional 
campaign of state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) against Rep. Robert J. 
Lagomarsino (R-Ojai). Hart, an opponent of Contra aid who narrowly lost to 
Lagomarsino, said of Neighbor to Neighbor, "While they had limited resources, 
they targeted them very effectively. They were helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to obtain Lagomarsino's view of the organization were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Neighbor to Neighbor has 43,000 members nationwide. Its nine chapters 
include groups in Ventura and Santa Barbara. The organization has an annual 
budget of $1.2 million, raised through donations and foundation grants, and 30 
full-time employees in eight cities. It has 1 1/2 paid positions in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley chapter adopted a four-point program Monday. Members pledged to 
flood Berman's office with telephone calls about ongoing human rights abuses in 
El Salvador; send letters about El Salvador to editors at Los Angeles 
newspapers; dispatch a delegation to meet with Berman, and continue the 
letter-writing campaign.

COUNCIL ASKED TO BAR PLANNERS FROM OWNING L.A. LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Los Angeles City Council members Joy Picus and Joel Wachs called Wednesday for 
city planning commissioners to divest ownership of all their property within 
city boundaries to avoid another conflict of interest like one that barred the 
commission from hearing the Porter Ranch development plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Picus-Wachs measure would force the five current commissioners to choose 
between owning land in the city -- other than their homes -- or serving on the 
board. The proposal joins a crowd of ethical reforms under consideration by 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Picus and Wachs also suggested that the city's Governmental Operations 
Committee, to which their proposal was sent, study similar prohibitions for all 
city commissioners, board members and the City Council itself. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came the same day the Board of Referred Powers, a five-member 
City Council panel that takes up matters that have posed conflicts for other 
city boards, gave preliminary approval to the mammoth Porter Ranch commercial 
and residential plan. 
</P>
<P>
Several board members expressed frustration that the Planning Commission did 
not grapple with the complex land-use issues involved in the $2-billion, 
1,300-acre development plan. 
</P>
<P>
In a City Hall news conference Wednesday morning, Picus said her divestment 
measure would reduce the chances that the Planning Commission would be bypassed 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Assistant City Atty. Anthony S. Alperin determined that 
Commissioner Theodore Stein Jr.'s part interest in a subdivision about a mile 
away from the Porter Ranch development posed a conflict of interest because 
Stein could benefit from street improvements involving the proposed 
development. The decision prohibited the entire commission from hearing the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"When the commission is disqualified from acting, then the people of Los 
Angeles lose because our system is based on having citizen input into the 
decision-making process," Picus said. "Those commissioners are part of that 
process." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Referred Powers has ruled on 12 planning cases since 1987 because 
of conflicts of interest involving commissioners, according to a review of 
board agendas released by Wachs. Seven of the disqualifications were the result 
of property holdings by commissioners. Others were the result of business 
dealings or involvement in community groups involved in matters before the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission President William G. Luddy said the Picus-Wachs proposal 
"is out of proportion to the perceived problem," noting that the commission has 
made decisions on thousands of pieces of property. 
</P>
<P>
Stein, an attorney, said he believes that the proposed ordinance would 
illegally discriminate against a whole class of Los Angeles residents -- 
property owners -- by barring them from participation on citizen panels. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's Board of Referred Powers hearing, several council members 
appeared reluctant to take on the Porter Ranch case and criticized the city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said he was "flabbergasted" by the city attorney's 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole process . . . has been turned on it head," he said. "By the same 
thinking, Stein could have a financial interest in any stoplight because he 
would use more gas. I don't know where it ends." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude, who also is a member of the Board of Referred Powers, 
said he "was uncomfortable being thrust in this kind of position. 
</P>
<P>
"I for one think we ought to move forward and try and change the state law or 
the City Charter or whatever it takes because we can't afford the 
decision-making process of this city to be handicapped in this way," Braude 
said. "I think we are missing a lot by not having this go through the Planning 
Commission."

INQUIRY UNDER WAY AFTER DEATH OF MAN NINE HOSPITALS BARRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES and ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writers

<P>
Medi-Cal officials said Wednesday that they are investigating the treatment of 
a Westminster man who was injured in a traffic accident and subsequently died 
after he reportedly was refused admission by nine hospitals in Orange, San 
Diego and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
The family of Juan Jimenez Collado said Wednesday that the 43-year-old former 
professional boxer probably would have survived if he could have been 
transferred from a rural Imperial County hospital to a large, urban hospital 
with sophisticated specialists on staff. 
</P>
<P>
But, saying they were full, were too far away or didn't take Medi-Cal patients, 
hospital after hospital declined to accept Jimenez. He died Sunday at the small 
community hospital that first cared for him -- the 80-bed Pioneers Memorial 
Hospital in Brawley. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody rejected him and we believe the reason they rejected him was that he 
had no money," Jimenez' stepson, David Carrillo, said bitterly Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Was a Crime' 
</P>
<P>
Added Jimenez' widow, Leticia, who was with her husband when he was struck by a 
hit-and-run driver on May 30, "Of course it was a crime" that he could not be 
moved to a bigger hospital. "The medical system is very wrong; what they want 
is money, when a life would be No. 1 priority." 
</P>
<P>
Pioneers nurse Nicholas Aguirre, who spent more than two weeks seeking a 
transfer for Jimenez, said the situation was one of "try to keep him here and 
lose him -- or try to transfer him to maximize care . . . The question remains, 
why couldn't we transfer him?" 
</P>
<P>
At Medi-Cal's regional office in San Diego, administrator Maria Leslie said her 
investigators want to know if any hospital violated its Medi-Cal contract when 
it rejected Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
By law, no hospital can be ordered to accept a patient, but hospitals with 
Medi-Cal contracts are supposed "to take reasonable steps to assure that a 
Medi-Cal patient receives appropriate care," Leslie noted. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie said her staffers on June 8 approved Jimenez' transfer to a larger 
hospital. Why he was never moved remained unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't comment on whether this patient would have survived" if he had been 
transferred, Leslie said. "That's what this investigation will probably 
involve." 
</P>
<P>
Also studying the Jimenez case were University of California officials. Acting 
at the request of Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista), they were 
considering a probe into why three UC hospitals -- UCLA, UC San Diego and UC 
Irvine medical centers -- had declined to admit Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
Peace field representative Charlene Rollbusch said the assemblyman was assured 
last Thursday that either UCSD or UCI could give Jimenez a bed. The next thing 
he knew, Jimenez had died in Brawley, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know why nothing was done while we both received assurances that the 
situation was being taken care of," Peace demanded in a letter sent Monday to 
UC government relations director Stephen A. Arditti. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a spokesman for the state Attorney General's office said his 
office may look into the situation. "There are requirements that emergency 
rooms must treat people who are brought to them," said spokesman Alan Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case of rejection by telephone," Ashby said. "He was in hospital 
where the doctors felt they were unable to provide the quality of medical 
treatment that was required. In that sense, it's almost like he was in an 
ambulance. It's something we could have jurisdiction over." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials from many of the hospitals that rejected Jimenez 
maintained that they had no other choice. 
</P>
<P>
At St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, callers Wednesday had complained: "How could 
you turn away a dying man?" spokesman Dennis Gaschen said. But he said that St. 
Joseph does not have a Medi-Cal contract, and so, by law, is not allowed to 
accept the transfer of a Medi-Cal patient. 
</P>
<P>
Gaschen added, "It's a shame that the man passed away, but it's our belief the 
man did not pass away from being refused to be transferred." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closer to Home 
</P>
<P>
At UC San Diego Medical Center, spokeswoman Pat Jacoby said officials there had 
suggested that Pioneers refer Jimenez to the medical center nearest his home -- 
UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
However, UC Irvine Medical was full when the call about Jimenez came in, 
according to medical center spokeswoman Elaine Beno. "He needed a surgical 
intensive care unit bed -- which we didn't have at the time of the call," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneers' Aguirre also contacted Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa, just east of 
San Diego, but was told that Grossmont was not a licensed trauma center and did 
not handle trauma patients such as Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
At Mercy Hospital in San Diego, spokeswoman Laura Avallone said Pioneers was 
asked to call a physician with more detail about Jimenez' case, but she didn't 
know what happened after that first call. At Sharp Memorial Hospital in San 
Diego, spokeswoman Cindy Cohheen said the hospital never refused care. As far 
as she knew, Cohheen said, no Sharp physician was ever contacted about Jimenez' 
case. 
</P>
<P>
And at UCLA, officials there decided Jimenez could be treated at a closer 
hospital. "We told them there are a lot of hospitals between UCLA and Imperial 
County that could adequately serve" him, said spokesman Jeff Otten. Otten added 
that the hospital's intensive care beds were full at the time Pioneers called. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said he also contacted Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center in Fountain Valley and Western Medical Center in Santa Ana. Officials 
from those centers could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez was critically injured May 30 at 2:15 a.m. when he stopped beside 
Highway 111 north of Niland in Imperial County to work on his overheating truck 
and was struck by a hit-and-run driver. 
</P>
<P>
He suffered major injuries -- massive head injuries and "the right side of his 
body was literally shattered," California Highway Patrol officer Christina 
Moore reported. 
</P>
<P>
At the nearest hospital, Pioneers, doctors quickly determined that Jimenez 
needed more sophisticated care than their small hospital could offer. 
</P>
<P>
"He needed an orthopedic specialist, a cardiovascular specialist, a kidney 
specialist," Jimenez' stepson Carrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Nurse Aguirre said he began contacting other hospitals soon after Jimenez was 
admitted. At one point, Sharp Memorial Hospital indicated it would take 
Jimenez, Aguirre said. But then a snafu involving Jimenez' Medi-Cal paper work 
held up the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time we got into a block fence," Aguirre said. And all along, Aguirre 
said, "We knew this patient was going to die if we didn't transfer him some 
place" that was "better equipped." 
</P>
<P>
When Jimenez died Sunday, officials with the Imperial County coroner attributed 
the cause to gangrene in his legs and a problem with blood clotting.

FAUCETS, PATIENCE RUN DRY IN TINY ACTON; 
</P>
<P>
WATER SHORTAGES PLAGUE 40 HOUSEHOLDS FOR 3 DAYS DURING HEAT WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a long, hot day behind the wheel of his delivery truck, Eric McCloskey 
longed for a cool shower when he drove home to Acton, only to discover -- along 
with dozens of neighbors -- that water taps were dry. He showered by pouring 
water from 5-gallon jugs, his earthquake emergency supply, over his head. 
</P>
<P>
After another blistering day behind the wheel, McCloskey happily discovered 
Wednesday evening that the water was back on. At least briefly. 
</P>
<P>
"He was taking a shower and the water went off again," said his father, Hugh 
McCloskey, with a slight chuckle. "It's been fun if you keep your sense of 
humor. But it's also been trying." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Awareness 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey's experience was typical of the annoying inconveniences felt in Acton 
for three days during an intermittent water shortage. The shortage affected 
only about 40 households in the town of 6,500, but residents said it has 
heightened public awareness of the rural community's fragile water supply and 
focused attention on the impact of development there. 
</P>
<P>
Unusually heavy water use during the current heat wave left homes without water 
for hours at a time, and county workers rushed Wednesday to hook a private well 
to the Los Angeles County water system to assist customers left high and dry by 
the shortage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Public Works trucked water to remote households in the rural 
community, which is 47 miles north of Los Angeles, to water down sweltering 
horses. Department workers walked door-to-door Wednesday, posting flyers urging 
residents to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hartley, assistant deputy director of the Department of Public Works, said 
the high demand for water left the county's two water tanks, which hold 1.2 
million gallons, well below normal levels. The county's one well could not 
refill the tanks fast enough so water pressure fell, leaving some homes without 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Waterworks District No. 37 serves about 700 homes in Acton. Most 
residents obtain their water from private wells and were not affected by the 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley said the town's water supply is not in danger. "We've got plenty of 
water in the aquifer," he said. The problem, he said, was the lack of a 
secondary water source to augment the county well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Dipper Water 
</P>
<P>
The department has worked since Saturday to hook the water district to Big 
Dipper Water Delivery Service, a private water company. Hartley expected to 
have Big Dipper water flowing into the county system Wednesday night, but 
apparently not in time for Eric McCloskey's shower. 
</P>
<P>
Since the county has not used Big Dipper water before, the Health Department 
urged residents, as a precaution, to boil water for a few days because purity 
tests on the company's water have not been completed. Hartley said the initial 
rush of water might release contaminants in the new pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley said the problem should be solved in August, when a new well, paid for 
by developers, is completed. Under a policy adopted 18 months ago, developers 
cannot build until they provide their own water supply, he said. The county is 
negotiating to obtain water from the Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency, 
which receives water from northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Residents angrily blamed the water shortage on developers, county planners and 
the Board of Supervisors. "It's a known fact there's a water problem, and they 
keep building up here," Sandra Conn said. Conn said she drove to a friend's 
house 17 miles away to load up buckets and barrels of water for her three 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents said developers have installed lush landscaping that requires 
more water than local conditions will allow. Some newcomers, they groused, 
still think they live in Los Angeles and waste water accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Brink, who has lived in Acton since 1946, said locals understand they 
have to conserve in the country. "We just never had water to waste," he said. 
"We still have a working outhouse for emergencies. It hasn't been used in 20 
years but it's there."

FIRST LATINO AND AN INCUMBENT START INGLEWOOD COUNCIL TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose A. Fernandez, a Cuban immigrant who says he has been working toward public 
office since his teen-age years, became the first Latino on the Inglewood City 
Council Tuesday, representing a district he describes as among the most 
ethnically diverse in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, 29, a graduate of Lennox High School and UCLA who works as an aide 
to state Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk), surprised the Inglewood political 
Establishment in April when he outpolled four opponents for the District 3 
seat. In the June 6 runoff, Fernandez defeated former two-term councilman Bruce 
U. Smith, 63% to 37%. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez fills the seat of Ann Wilk, who died of a heart attack last December. 
But another vacancy developed Tuesday when Ervin (Tony) Thomas was forced to 
step down from the District 4 seat. Thomas will face a special election against 
challenger Garland Hardeman in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The election, a rematch of a disputed 1987 council race between Thomas and 
Hardeman, was ordered by a Superior Court judge who ruled that Thomas campaign 
workers had violated the Election Code by intimidating voters. The election 
will be scheduled for a Tuesday sometime between late September and 
mid-October, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Also sworn in at Tuesday's meeting was Councilman Daniel K. Tabor, a two-term 
incumbent who fended off an aggressive challenge from John Gibbs, an aide and 
son-in-law to the late Assemblyman Curtis Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Inglewood, where 40% of the population is Latino, called 
Fernandez's rise to prominence a signal that a politically dormant community is 
beginning to awaken. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an indication that we're a melting pot," said Mayor Edward Vincent. "The 
people of Inglewood have shown that they can elect someone regardless of race, 
creed or national origin." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, acknowledging that his election may motivate other Latinos to become 
involved in city government, called his victory noteworthy for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Historic Moment' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a historic moment because all ethnic groups came together," Fernandez 
said. "I think Inglewood is among the most diverse cities in the South Bay and 
my district is among the most diverse in Inglewood. That means I'm representing 
one of the most diverse districts of any elected official in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, whose mother, brother and grandparents attended Tuesday's council 
meeting, called Inglewood's image one area that he will concentrate on during 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to reinvigorate the community's pride in itself," he said. "We want to 
have clean streets. We want people involved in government. We've come a long 
way, but we have a long way to go."

TORRANCE STUDENT PLACES 3RD IN CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Kuniyuki is fascinated by government and politics, and that interest paid 
off this week when the Torrance High School junior finished third in a 
nationwide citizenship competition in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old won a $3,000 scholarship in the finals of the Citizen Bee, an 
annual competition that tests high school students' knowledge of American 
history, geography, economics, culture and current events. 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyuki was delighted with his performance. "Just to place in the top three is 
incredible," he said in an interview. "It was very exciting, not only the 
excitement of the competition but being in Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studied an Hour a Day 
</P>
<P>
He said the competition was nerve-racking as he faced 75 other semifinalists 
from 29 states. But he was ready for the questions after studying an hour a day 
for several weeks using a personal computer. Kuniyuki emerged from the first 
round of written and oral tests last Sunday as one of 15 finalists. 
</P>
<P>
One of the lighter moments in Monday's final round of oral exams occurred when 
Kuniyuki, who is Japanese-American, was asked to imagine that he was an 
American citizen of Japanese descent at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pure coincidence," Kuniyuki said. "It was hilarious. I tried to make a 
joke out of it" by striking a thoughtful pose. 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyuki was asked what chance he would have of successfully challenging the 
internment of Japanese-Americans. He answered correctly that he would not 
prevail because of a Supreme Court decision that upheld the internment. 
</P>
<P>
The question that Kuniyuki liked best asked him to name the authors of two 
controversial books -- "Reflections of a Public Man" and "Window of 
Opportunity" -- which had gotten their authors in trouble. The answer: former 
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) and Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyuki said the competition reinforced his strong interest in government. He 
said he finds it "very interesting to see how people govern themselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes of Studying at UCLA 
</P>
<P>
A straight-A student, Kuniyuki is a member of the Torrance High Service Club, 
the Science Club, the Chess Club, the Debate Club and the academic decathlon 
team. He said he would like to study political science at UCLA before embarking 
on a career in public service, lobbying or political consulting. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizen Bee competition is held annually by the Close Up Foundation, a 
nonprofit organization devoted to civic education. In Southern California, the 
competition was sponsored by The Times and Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Co. This 
is the first year that California students have participated. 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to combat what the foundation calls "an alarming lack 
of knowledge about the basics of American history, government and public life" 
among high school students.

WITNESS WAS THE REAL KILLER, LAWYER ASSERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attorney for a Palmdale man charged with the execution-style slaying of two 
other men Wednesday accused an alleged witness of being the real killer. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, attorney Leonard R. Milstein charged that Dan Lucero 
intended to kill defendant Brad Millward but accidentally shot one of the 
victims instead. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Millward faces the death penalty for first-degree murder in the 
July 5, 1987, killings of Bruce Gruber, 28, of Yucca Valley and Albert Dulyea, 
37, of Norwalk. Both men were shot in the desert east of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Over nearly five days of testimony before a San Fernando Superior Court jury, 
Lucero, 22, of Palmdale, testified that he, his wife and two children were 
driving along Avenue P when he saw Millward holding a gun several inches from 
Gruber's head. Lucero said he heard a gunshot, then saw Gruber fall to the 
ground and Millward flee into the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero, who said he had never met Millward or Gruber, brought the dying Gruber 
to the police station with the assistance of several passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bullet-Riddled Body 
</P>
<P>
Milstein told the jury that Lucero brought Gruber's body to authorities to 
cover up his crime. He charged that Lucero, Gruber and other members of an 
Antelope Valley drug-trafficking ring killed Dulyea because they thought that 
he and Millward were federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents. Dulyea's 
bullet-riddled body was found in Millward's garage. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber was killed accidentally by Lucero after Gruber caught Millward as he was 
attempting to escape, Milstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber and another man caught Millward and wrestled him into a brown 
Oldsmobile, the lawyer said. Millward managed to steer the car off the road, 
get out and run into the desert, Milstein alleged. But Gruber caught him and 
then Lucero, who had been following in his own car, fired at Millward, but 
fatally wounded Gruber, Milstein said. 
</P>

While he was on the stand, Lucero repeatedly denied killing Gruber and denied 
involvement in a methamphetamine ring.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GAS FUMES IGNITE AT REPAIR SHOP; 2 BURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apilot light ignited gasoline vapors Wednesday at an engine repair shop in 
Chatsworth, seriously burning two men, the Los Angeles City Fire Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The men, both in their 20s, were taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center 
with second-degree burns, Battalion Chief Walt Wilmington said. The victims' 
names were withheld until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
The men, who are employees of the shop, were walking outside the building in 
the 20200 block of Prairie Street when a pilot light in an engine-cleaning oven 
ignited vapors from gasoline that was being poured into a drum, Wilmington 
said. The flash ignited some nearby cardboard, but firefighters quickly 
extinguished the flames, he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI REFUSES TO NAME CENTER AFTER LUCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America may love Lucy, but Simi Valley wants to keep it a distant affair. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has unanimously rejected a suggestion from one of Lucille 
Ball's fans to name its yet-to-be-built cultural center after the comedienne. 
Ball, who died April 26 at age 77 in Los Angeles, starred in the popular TV 
series "I Love Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
"To our knowledge, she's neither filmed nor visited here," Councilwoman Ann 
Rock said. "There's just no connection." 
</P>
<P>
The council's action Monday followed the proposal's defeat earlier this month 
by the Cultural Arts Assn. The group soon will begin raising about $15 million 
for a performing arts complex, including two theaters, at the Civic Center on 
Tapo Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
"To honor Lucy would preclude us from naming the center after a large donor," 
said Judy Michaels, association president. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Flook, the 82-year-old fan who campaigned vigorously for the 
appellation, said she was disappointed by the city's decision and vowed 
Wednesday to find another way to honor her idol, such as establishing a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she had any Lucy memorabilia herself, Flook said that mementos were 
not necessary because "I have her in my heart."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OLD HOMES MAY MOVE TO PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council will hold a public hearing July 11 on the 
proposed use of Dominguez Park as a place where historic old homes scheduled 
for demolition could be preserved. Officials said a citywide search failed to 
turn up any other suitable sites. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan is approved, the 20-acre park at Beryl and 190th streets would 
provide space for several homes, beginning with the Morrell House, which is on 
a temporary foundation at the Perry Alison Playfield. 
</P>
<P>
The city paid about $80,000 to move the house from North Catalina Avenue to the 
play field in March, but abandoned plans to set it up there permanently after 
neighbors protested that they were being deprived of recreational space. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Director Ken Montgomery estimated that it will cost about $17,000 
to move the Morrell House another 1,200 feet to Dominguez Park, a former city 
dump site. Another $33,000 has been included in the proposed 1989-90 budget to 
cover costs, which would include the installation of a permanent foundation and 
a fence to protect the house from vandals. The Historical Society is raising 
money to restore the turn-of-the-century home. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said establishing an area for historical homes at Dominguez Park 
will not detract from other uses of the park, which has a Little League field, 
a playground, basketball courts, rest rooms and parking.

FIRED AFTER ASSAULT SENTENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SHERIFF'S DISPATCHER REINSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior dispatcher for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department who was fired 
after pleading guilty to assaulting his ex-wife was reinstated Wednesday when 
the county's Civil Service Commission ruled that his crime created "no 
reasonable likelihood of impairment or disruption of public service." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Haynes, a communications dispatcher for seven years, had earlier this 
year continued to work for the Sheriff's Department while he was incarcerated 
at a work-furlough program. But after his firing in May, Haynes appealed the 
dismissal to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
On a 3-1 vote, the commission ordered Haynes reinstated, with full back pay to 
the time of his discharge on May 4. 
</P>
<P>
The dissenting vote was from commission President Carlton Hargrave, who said 
after the meeting that he believed Haynes should have been suspended rather 
than terminated. 
</P>
<P>
"He is working with a law enforcement agency and his pleading guilty to a 
misdemeanor is job-related," Hargrave said. "But there probably should have 
been a suspension, and then he should have been returned to work." 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony, Haynes, 39, appeared twice in court in January, once to 
plead guilty to battery and later to enter a plea of no contest to violating a 
court order to stay away from his former wife, Nancy Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
180-Day Sentence 
</P>
<P>
On March 6 he was sentenced to 180 days in a work-furlough center and ordered 
to pay a fine of $180 on the battery charge. He was given a three-year 
probation term for violating the court order. 
</P>
<P>
He began serving the jail sentence April 7, which meant he was an incarcerated 
inmate while working for the Sheriff's Department through his May termination. 
</P>
<P>
But the Civil Service Commission, in issuing its report Wednesday on the case, 
saw no problem to public safety posed by Haynes' criminal conviction and his 
work for a law enforcement agency. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes "is very competent as a senior communications dispatcher and has, at all 
times, exhibited the ability to act calmly, act professionally, and handle 
stress while performing his duties," the report said. Haynes "is well-liked and 
respected by his fellow employees and first- and second-line supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
The commission added that Haynes has not been a sworn peace officer, and that 
therefore there was no evidence that his guilty plea or sentence "could easily 
result in impairment or disruption of the public services provided by the 
Sheriff's Department."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE ORDERS ZONING STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council has voted 4 to 3 to study how adjoining neighborhoods 
would be affected by rezoning the former Columbia School site for residential 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
The study by the Planning Department will consider the effects of rezoning the 
land for low- and medium-density residential uses, a senior housing project or 
a specific plan development. The study will go to the Planning Commission, 
which is likely to recommend a zone change to the council by August, city 
officials said. The council decides zoning issues. 
</P>
<P>
The five-acre lot on 186th Street, which is owned by the school and zoned for 
public use, has been the subject of several hearings by various city agencies 
and the Torrance Unified School District. School officials have said they want 
to build apartments or other high-density residential developments on the site. 
City Council members have expressed concern about the density of the project 
and the possibility it might include subsidized housing. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents have expressed a preference for low- or medium-density 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Bill Applegate and Dan Walker voted against the study, saying the 
council does not need further study to decide how to rezone the land. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as a delay," Applegate said. "We've been studying this thing to 
death." Councilman Tim Mock also voted against the study. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials could not be reached for comment.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOAT DEATH CLAIMS REFUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Avalon City Council has refused claims filed against the city stemming from 
a boating accident off the Santa Catalina Island coast that killed two Orange 
County men and injured three others last December. 
</P>
<P>
The claims allege that a harbor patrol officer observed the pilot of a 19-foot 
fishing boat drunk and cruising at high speeds, but failed to take any 
preventive action before the boat crashed on rocks off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
One of the claims was filed by Newport Beach resident Mary Glose, whose 
husband, William Glose, 33, and son, Sean Caudillo, 22, were killed. Both men 
were passengers on the Impulse, out of Newport Beach, which crashed on the 
rocks off Lovers Cove, on the island's east coast. The claim sought an 
unspecified amount for wrongful death and various expenses. 
</P>
<P>
A separate claim seeking $275,000 was filed by David Wilken of Costa Mesa, a 
passenger on the boat who survived the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The men were among four passengers aboard the boat, which was piloted and owned 
by Alfred Gausewitz. The claim alleges that a harbor patrol officer should have 
issued a warning or stopped the boat before it left Avalon Harbor, made a 
U-turn and went up on the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Gausewitz and another passenger survived the crash.

DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: PRIMATES PUT ON THE RITZ AT ZOO; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday's RITZ (Rendezvous in the Zoo) gala may have been for the birds, but 
it also was for the chimpanzees, the duck-billed platypuses, the hangnailed 
sloths and the other creatures who have come to call the San Diego Zoo their 
home away from the jungle, veld and rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
More than 850 primates paid well to take a gander at the wild geese, timid 
toucans and cocky cockatoos that have made the zoo one of the planet's prime 
entrepots for man and beast, with the result that more than $150,000 was raised 
toward the construction of a new enclosure for the zoo's pygmy chimpanzees. 
RITZ also officially opened the summer social season, and was widely 
appreciated as a sort of festive monsoon that relieved the long dry spell of 
second-rate celebrations that had left circuit regulars gasping for a refresher 
course in how to party in high style. 
</P>
<P>
RITZ specifically honored King Tut, the salmon-crested cockatoo who had been, 
until the previous day, the zoo's official greeter since his arrival on March 
25, 1925. Zoo officials claimed that the above-average avian has welcomed more 
than 100 million visitors to the park, which may explain why, in its first 
taste of retirement, the bird turned his back on the black-tie crowd and 
callously crunched bird seed when he should have been issuing caws of greeting. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the San Diego crowd proved that it has room in its heart for a 
cockatoo or two by clustering around Tut both during the cocktail hour and 
later, when the bird was given a triumphal parade through the open-air 
ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
In its sixth annual incarnation, RITZ provided (as it always does) the 
opportunity for rare meetings between man and beast. The wandering Dorothies in 
the crowd chanted rather pointlessly for lions, tigers and bears -- all these 
were kept at bay -- but it was possible to have close encounters with llamas, 
camels, elephants, Clydesdales and miniature horses, since the zoo was 
determined to show its treasures at close range. Except during the first course 
of the dinner, fish were excluded from the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
RITZ opened in traditional fashion with a cocktail-hour meander through Primate 
Mesa, where man and monkey had the opportunity to observe one another at 
leisure and draw appropriate conclusions. The formally dressed participants in 
this annual stand-off had the better deal, though, because champagne was passed 
liberally and the hors d'oeuvres buffets yielded such notable tidbits as smoked 
oyster canapes and sizzling conch fritters. While monkeys have been known to 
ape mankind, none of these refreshments enjoy great repute on the simian table 
d'hote. 
</P>
<P>
The dress code somewhat needlessly encouraged "jungle elegance," which resulted 
in so many women in leopard prints that spots seemed to swim before one's eyes; 
the invitations also, in honor of Tut, invited Egyptian garb, with the result 
that 
</P>
<P>
many Cleopatras and even several Rameses held center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner was announced separately by chairwoman Alison Tibbitts, who summoned the 
faithful to table from atop Walter the camel, a domesticated dromedary, and by 
the deep brass tones of a Japanese gong, which a zoo staffer pounded with 
unfettered delight. The meal was served al fresco in a starlit space engagingly 
decorated by design chiefs Dick Ford and Liz Smith to resemble an ancient 
Egyptian boit de nuit. Giant, lighted standards of cockatoo Tut in Pharaonic 
garb rose high above the tables and defined the ballroom. Best of all, if 
utterly unplanned, was a triumphant full moon that, in the sudden absence of 
June gloom, rode high above the party through the night. 
</P>
<P>
The Wayne Foster Orchestra and a subsidiary Foster rock band called Sparkle 
alternated on two dance floors for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
Guests had barely had time to dig into their interesting first course of 
vegetable terrine when master of ceremonies Rolf Benirschke announced the 
traditional parade of animals. Led by the zoo's good-will ambassador Joan 
Embery, the parade commenced rather tamely with Embery driving a 
Clydesdale-drawn shay, but picked up when a zebra, a cheetah and a lemur joined 
the procession. 
</P>
<P>
The parade reached its peak when Tibbitts and zoo board President Al Anderson 
careened into the ballroom atop Carol the elephant, who wore a double necklace 
of bells and jingled grandly as she sashayed among the tables. (Carol used her 
trunk to pick the winning ticket in the raffle for a 1989 Mercury Cougar, which 
led Benirschke, who shortly will leave his job as daytime host of a television 
game show, to wisecrack, "It's just like 'Wheel of Fortune,' we're giving away 
a car." Gordon Bell of El Cajon held the winning ticket.) 
</P>
<P>
A clever dessert of meringue cockatoos followed the cabbage-leaf-wrapped filet 
mignon entrees, and released the guests to alternately contemplate King Tut's 
long career and to step out gamely to Foster's stylish Big Band 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included Helen and James Davis; zoo director Doug Myers and his 
wife, Barbara; Ruth and Jim Mulvaney; Audrey Geisel; Dick Duffy; Judy and Chuck 
Bieler; Alison and George Gildred; Mary and Bruce Hazard; Judith Harris with 
Robert Singer; Tisha Swortwood; Betty Jo and Hal Williams; Junko and Larry 
Cushman; Dottie and Patrick Haggerty; Betty and Al deBakcsy; Mary and Dallas 
Clark; Eleanor and Art Herzman; Jane and Tom Fetter; Jan and Mike Madigan; 
Jeanne Jones with Don Breitenberg; Susan and Bill Rick; Beverly and Bill 
Muchnic; Georgia Borthwick with Tom Fleming; Marge and Fielder Lutes, and Tommi 
and Bob Adelizzi. 
</P>
<P>
LA JOLLA -- Earlier the same day, the San Diego County Mental Health Hospital 
Auxiliary cleaned up (as it were) at the second annual Black Tie Car Wash &amp; 
Cafe, a sudsy, daylong frolic at which several score of the well-known 
meticulously scrubbed several hundred autos. 
</P>
<P>
Auxiliary President Lois Kolender (whose husband, former Police Chief Bill 
Kolender, was among those wielding hoses and soapy rags), said the event was 
intended more to attract visibility for the hospital than to earn substantial 
funds, although at $15 a car the proceeds did amount to a respectable figure. 
The auxiliary works for the benefit of patients and provides therapeutic 
equipment, clothing and personal care items. 
</P>
<P>
The car wash is the brainchild of chairwoman Nancy Hester, who also founded La 
Jolla's annual "Off-the-Wall" street dance, given every August for the UC San 
Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
While there is nothing unusual about a car wash per se, the Black Tie Car Wash 
is a definitely trendy variant, and Saturday's edition occasionally tied up 
traffic along Girard Avenue as gowned and tuxedoed shills directed a string of 
luxury sedans and economy models into the parking lot of San Diego Trust &amp; 
Savings Bank. There was a definite benefit to the experience, since cars did 
emerge sparkling, but the amusement value lay in the identities of the car wash 
staff, which numbered some of the leading political, business and social 
figures in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Councilman and mayoral candidate Bill Cleator worked side-by-side 
with philanthropist Joe Hibben, restaurateur Ron Zappardino and San Diego 
Symphony board member Linda Hooberman, and hotelier Ann Evans joined publishing 
consultant Janet Gallison in flipping burgers in the impromptu cafe. In the 
background, one-man band Ira Cobb set the mood by offering such tunes as "Come 
Away With Me Lucille, in My Merry Oldsmobile." 
</P>
<P>
The car washers played as they sprayed, and onlookers who wandered too close to 
the work area could find themselves suddenly drenched by a well-aimed hose. 
Cleator remarked that the job was not that different from serving on the City 
Council, and radio executive Paul Palmer said the washers had taken as their 
motto, "When we're finished with your car, it will look a little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
Hester said there had been a few snafus. Just before the event began, the keys 
to the water outlet were lost, and three car alarms were set off during washing 
-- but she added that the group was having fun and making money for the 
hospital, which she said was all to the good. 
</P>
<P>
Among other volunteers were Anne Jones, Rob Butterfield, George Munger, Marilyn 
Cleator, Robin Mackenzie, Melanie Cohrs, Bob Cluck, Carol Vistrand, Vicki Eddy, 
Russ Willson, Lynn Kuerbis, Barry Levich, Ed Washington, Ed Self, Mac Canty and 
Maggie Coleman.

ROBIN BRENNER, QUEEN OF THE ANT FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The red ants, they live in fields of sandy earth, in tunnels that lead every 
which way. The woman, she drives by and sees a field. She stops and takes her 
shovel to dig at the red ants. 
</P>
<P>
Intricate patterns of tunnels lie just beneath the surface. Sometimes she finds 
small pockets, places where the ants have stored seed and other food. 
</P>
<P>
"They even have graveyards underground," the woman says. "You'll hit one place, 
and they'll all be dead." 
</P>
<P>
When she finds places where the ants are alive, when she reaches to gather 
them, they bite. They leave sores that swell and itch. 
</P>
<P>
The woman has learned these things over many years because her father made her 
dig for ants when she was very young, taught her how to do it. Thirty years 
later, she is still digging for ants. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of children across America, like so many ants scattered about, have 
never heard of Robin Brenner, but they're happier because she keeps digging. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industrious Diggers 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old woman gathers pogonomyrmex Californicus, a most industrious 
worker that is perfectly suited to live in those clear-plastic toys known as 
Uncle Milton Ant Farms. Pogis, as they are called, will toil in daylight, 
digging as children watch on. 
</P>
<P>
Brenner is equally suited to her task of unearthing these insects. After many 
years, she can dig for them better than her father ever could. 
</P>
<P>
A thin woman of blond hair and few words, she scours fields near Palmdale, 
Lancaster and San Bernardino, sometimes as far south as San Diego. She looks 
for small openings in the ground, tiny ants scurrying about. She sets to work 
like her late father, Kenneth Gidney, did. 
</P>
<P>
Gidney started digging ants in 1959 after answering an Uncle Milton ad in the 
Los Angeles Times. He learned by trial and error, learned to slice through the 
dirt layer by layer, following the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a hillbilly from Tennessee, and he knew the ground," said "Uncle" 
Milton Levine, who invented the ant farm and has sold almost 10 million of the 
$8.99 toys in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
Gidney taught his offspring early on. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 10 children and everybody did it," Brenner recalls. "We picked them 
into coffee cans with our hands. You'd get bit. It hurt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacuuming Ants 
</P>
<P>
Brenner -- who took a decade off from ant collecting after she was married -- 
is the only sibling who has carried on the tradition. But she doesn't make her 
three children do it, and she has added technology to the process. She fixed a 
car vacuum to a Tupperware bowl and now, after she digs up tunnels of the red 
ants, she vacuums them up. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 hours' work, Brenner can collect 50,000 ants. Queen ants -- larger, 
darker and winged -- must be avoided. If they are included in the batch, the 
others won't dig. Brenner loads her bounty into a blue Blazer and drives them 
home to Phelan in San Bernardino County 
</P>
<P>
Back at the house, the work is simpler. 
</P>
<P>
The ants and dirt are poured onto large plates. For some reason of insect 
logic, the ants emerge from the dirt to crawl off the plates and Brenner puts 
them into large cans with a few drops of water to keep them alive. 
</P>
<P>
During an average week, Brenner will collect and store some 200,000 ants. On 
Fridays and Saturdays, Brenner and a half-dozen hired workers put the ants, 
one-by-one, into vials. Thirty ants to a vial. No more, no less. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting there hour after hour, counting ants . . . it's tedious," she says. 
Brenner must constantly hire new workers because "they get bored counting the 
ants." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I'm sitting up late at night, I think 'People don't know how 
hard this is. They don't know where these ants come from. They don't know who 
much sleep I'm missing." 
</P>
<P>
The ants will live 10 days, 15 at most, in a vial. So each Sunday, Brenner 
delivers as many as 6,000 vials to Uncle Milton headquarters in Culver City. 
The vials are promptly sent to any kid with an Uncle Milton Ant Farm and the 
redeemable coupon that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15 Million Ants 
</P>
<P>
Levine said his company sends out 500,000 vials a year. That is 15 million 
ants' worth. 
</P>
<P>
Two other people besides Brenner provide the insects, but Brenner remains, like 
her father, the prized ant collector around Uncle Milton Industries. She earns 
35 cents a vial -- about a penny an ant -- and has paid for horses, a stable 
and a back yard riding arena with the profits. 
</P>
<P>
"She does great," Levine said. "She did it since she was a kid and she knows 
the business." 
</P>
<P>
Patience, she said, is the key. So she keeps at it. 
</P>
<P>
During summer, when the ground is dry and the ants stray from their tunnels, 
she splits her time between collecting and reconnaissance, finding prime ant 
hills and marking them with white stakes. 
</P>
<P>
During winter, when ants stay home and the earth is soft for digging, she 
returns to reap what she has sown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a never-ending process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
True, there isn't much chance the supply will run dry. 
</P>
<P>
As Levine put it: "There's a whole lot more ants out there. They'll never die. 
I don't think even an atomic bomb would put them to sleep."

SYNAGOGUE OPENS DOORS TO CONGREGANTS WHO ARE DEAF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MICHAEL ARKUSH, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
For much of her youth, Judy SlomovicGunter missed out on the Jewish culture she 
deeply cherished. 
</P>
<P>
Deaf since birth, she frequently could not understand the teachers or 
participate in class discussions at her North Hollywood religious school. And 
the deaf community offered no programs in Jewish education. 
</P>
<P>
She was an outsider in both worlds. Until she discovered Temple Beth Solomon of 
the Deaf in Arleta in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only place I can feel both deaf and Jewish," Slomovic Gunter said 
through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 Southland Jews, most of whom are hearing impaired, belong to the 
congregation, which celebrates its 29th birthday this month. 
</P>
<P>
By providing congregants who sign for Sabbath services every other Friday and 
religious instruction on Sundays, the synagogue enables hearing-impaired Jews 
to observe their faith without misunderstanding or embarrassment. Worshipers 
say they feel a genuine sense of community with their peers. In addition, the 
temple is a forum for socialization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Obstacles 
</P>
<P>
"We can't go to a regular movie because we can't follow the dialogue," said 
Slomovic Gunter. "It's there and yet it's not accessible to us. Deafness is not 
just a hearing loss. It's a communication loss, and the last thing we need when 
we go to temple are more obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Alan Henkin, who is not hearing impaired, said the synagogue helps make 
up for "deaf people's limited opportunity for empowerment in society." 
</P>
<P>
Henkin said congregants staff all the committees, set the budget and the 
schedule for the Sunday religious school, and organize services. When they are 
not meeting in person, they communicate with a TTD (Telecommunications Device 
for the Deaf) machine, through which their typed messages are relayed back and 
forth over the telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
Temple members regard their self-sufficiency with great pride. 
</P>
<P>
"We are grateful for the help of others," said Bess Hyman, 70, who joined the 
congregation in 1973. "But we feel our temple is, of, by, and for the deaf and 
that is important to us. We pay its bills and we understand its services." 
</P>
<P>
According to Martin Florsheim, president of the National Congress of Jewish 
Deaf, there are an estimated 750,000 hearing-impaired Jews in the United 
States. Temple Beth Solomon, he said, is one of a handful of synagogues for the 
hearing-impaired in the United States -- the others are in New York, Chicago 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Temple Beth Solomon was organized in 1960. With comedian George Jessel in 
attendance, worshipers held their first Sabbath service in the Chadwick Chapel 
of Temple Israel of Hollywood. For the first five years, members traveled to 
various host temples and became known as "the mobile congregation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Home 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1960s, congregants were eager for a permanent location. They found 
it in 1965 when the temple bought the Arleta building, which belonged to 
another synagogue, Temple Beth Torah. 
</P>
<P>
One of the initial questions was: With what branch of the Jewish religion -- 
Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox -- would the new synagogue affiliate? Henkin 
said the temple's founders approached the Orthodox and Reform communities, but 
were accepted only by the Reform movement. Some Orthodox Jews, he added, have 
not always accepted the hearing impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a body of uninformed literature among some Orthodox Jews," Henkin 
said, "which makes assumptions that because they can't hear, they can't think 
clearly, a body of law which severly restricts deaf people. But outside of that 
part of the Orthodox community, this attitude is seen as anachronistic." 
</P>
<P>
Most congregations, Henkin said, have been receptive to deaf worshipers. Other 
synagogues have invited Jews from Temple Beth Solomon to attend their services. 
Temple Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, for example, is currently making plans to 
help celebrate the 1991 bar mitzvah of Brad Cohen, whose Encino family belongs 
to both synagogues. A rabbi from each temple will lead the ceremony for Cohen, 
who is hearing impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"Temple Beth Solomon is a perfect example of the Jewish community attitude that 
all its members are entitled to express its tradition," said Neal Schnall, 
principal of the Hebrew School at Temple Valley Beth Shalom. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Henkin said, while many synagogues welcome hearing impaired congregants, 
they don't provide the resources to make worship meaningful for them. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't understand all the issues," Henkin said. "Finding interpreters for 
$10 or $20 an hour can get expensive, and they will do it maybe once a month." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign Language 
</P>
<P>
Said Florsheim, who is hearing impaired: "I would love to see rabbis learning 
sign language and understanding deaf culture so they can serve us better. We 
would love to see many temples for the deaf, but it's unrealistic due to the 
small number of deaf Jews in other cities." 
</P>
<P>
At Temple Beth Solomon, Henkin read from the prayer book while worshipers sign. 
Congregants include hearing-impaired children and adults, along with some 
hearing parents of deaf children. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of music is very noticeable, especially in a religion which regards 
song as a powerful expression. Henkin said the temple occasionally, on special 
holidays, employs a choir of hearing impaired people, who sign simultaneously 
with the songs, "but generally, we find it part of the hearing culture, which 
has no place in a deaf synagogue." 
</P>
<P>
Hyman, who was born with a slight hearing loss and didn't become totally deaf 
until 15 years ago, admits she misses music in services but added, "Look at 
what I am getting instead, Judaism in a language I can understand." 
</P>
<P>
Temple Beth Solomon, said Hyman, has helped her renew her sense of dignity, 
lost when hearing difficulties caused her embarrassment at her temple in West 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me a front seat at their high holiday services and that's a good 
thing because front seats are usually very costly," said Hyman, of Van Nuys. 
"But I couldn't understand and follow. I stood up long after everyone else, and 
I sat down long after everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Observing Laws 
</P>
<P>
Other congregants share Hyman's appreciation for Temple Beth Solomon, even if 
they may differ on how customs and laws should be observed. At Temple Beth 
Solomon, members of all three branches of Judaism must learn to coexist. Even 
though the temple is affiliated with the Reform movement, there are members who 
are Conservative and Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it illustrates in a very tangible way the manner in which people can 
meet each other in spite of differences and be united," said Barbara Boyd, 
congregation president. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd recalled a temple banquet three years ago when she was persuaded by 
Slomovic Gunter to serve kosher food. Boyd said she wanted to argue that a 
reform synagogue didn't need kosher food at banquets. "She argued back," Boyd 
said, " 'Yes, but do you want to reach the whole Jewish deaf community?' And I 
had no argument left. So we decided on a kosher event, and it was a tremendous 
success." 
</P>
<P>
Slomovic Gunter said when she first became involved in Temple Beth Solomon in 
1982 she brought her Orthodox upbringing with her. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt TBS wasn't Jewish enough," she said, "and that rubbed some of the 
long-timers, so it took some maturity on my part to be more tolerant of other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Slomovic Gunter belongs to the younger set of hearing impaired Jews at a temple 
dominated by older men and women; one recent Friday night service attracted 
only a few of the younger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
She said young deaf Jews often marry outside their faith, and when the issue of 
religious affiliation is brought up in the family, they choose another religion 
because they haven't received much, if any, education in Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope for Future 
</P>
<P>
The lack of youth involvement causes concern among the congregation's leaders. 
They hope to keep young people interested by promoting activities such as 
weekend camp outings, and they point to members Brad Cohen and Nathan Caldwell 
as their hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Brad, 10, who takes bar mitzvah classes once a week with Rabbi Henkin, said 
Temple Beth Solomon serves both academic and social needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to listen to stories about what the Jewish people did a long time ago," 
Brad said, as his father interpreted. "And I like to have good friends. I can 
understand so much more than at the (hearing) synagogue." 
</P>
<P>
His parents, Lou and Shelley, who are both hearing, said Temple Beth Solomon 
has brought their family closer together. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes the family a whole now," said Shelley Cohen. "There's only so much 
Jewish education you can teach at home. If you start it at home, it doesn't 
have the same impact. Now we can build on the things he learns at temple." 
</P>
<P>
Nathan, 11, of Panorama City attends Sunday classes, and looks forward to a 
life of regular enrichment in Jewish culture. "I want to learn more about God," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Sharon Caldwell, who is also deaf, said Nathan shows a much greater 
interest in Jewish customs and history than she did as a teen-ager. Like many 
deaf Jews who attended hearing synagogues, she says she never fit in, and 
showed no interest in further religious instruction. She is excited her son 
will be able to carry on the Jewish tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Slomovic Gunter acknowledges she will never catch all the richness of Jewish 
culture because of her hearing loss. But Temple Beth Solomon will bring her 
much closer than she ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"I just learn to adapt to the situation that's been forced on me," she said. 
"I'm proud to be a Jew in my own way."

WHAT'S THE ATTRACTION?; 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY AREA DRAWS ITS SHARE OF TOURISTS VISITING LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG, Lustig is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For an anticipated 6 million of the 49 million tourists who will visit Los 
Angeles this year, the San Fernando Valley area will be more than just another 
suburb, it will be a major place to play. 
</P>
<P>
Although a majority of those 49 million people fan out to various Westside 
attractions -- especially the beaches -- upon arrival, the Greater Los Angeles 
Visitors and Convention Bureau says the Valley is the No. 1 specific 
destination in the county, thanks to Universal Studios. (The top spot in 
Southern California is, of course, Disneyland.) Last year, more than 4 million 
people took the tour and, according to company spokesman Joan Bullard, 
attendance is up 30% over last year at this time. 
</P>
<P>
But Universal is not the only big draw in the Valley area. Of the top Southern 
California attractions tracked by the visitors bureau, the NBC Studio tour in 
Burbank ranks 11th, pulling in 150,000 people a year. Forest Lawn Memorial Park 
in Glendale, which is not ranked by the bureau, attracts about 500,000 tourists 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, these Valley-area attractions are not just vying for crowds; with 
exceptions such as Forest Lawn, which does not charge visitors, these amusement 
parks and studio tours are hoping to net some of the billions of dollars -- 
almost $13 billion in 1988 -- that tourists bring to the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a rundown on some of the top tourist spots in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Universal says the increase in attendance is due largely to its newest ride, 
Earthquake -- The Big One. "Attendance from other states was up 20% from last 
year, other countries up 30% and local attendance up 65%, all because of the 
Earthquake attraction," Bullard said. 
</P>
<P>
First-time Los Angeles visitor Dennis Dotson of Midwest City, Okla., said he 
brought his family to Universal to see how movies are made. "I've always 
enjoyed movies," he said, "so this is a real treat for us. If we were coming to 
L.A., we had to come here." 
</P>
<P>
Universal is not the only studio conducting tours. The Burbank Studios runs a 
daily tour for groups of up to 12 people, taking them through the various 
departments and operations of the combined Warner Bros. and Columbia Studios 
lot. About 70% of its 6,500 yearly visitors are from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
At NBC, up to 15 people at a time can take the 75-minute tour. "Over 50% of the 
people are from out of state or out of country," said Donna Goodwin of NBC. 
"And visitors have included citizens of Australia, New Zealand, Germany, 
England, Japan and France." 
</P>
<P>
While many on the tour hope to see Johnny Carson, and he does occasionally 
arrive while one is being conducted, it is some of his comments, particularly 
about local landmarks, that has peaked the interest of some tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny kept on talking about Forest Lawn, and that's why I came to the San 
Fernando Valley," said Florence Silverstein, 63, of Boston. "It was a very 
pretty place." 
</P>
<P>
Besides being pretty, 
</P>
<P>
Forest Lawn promotes itself as the final resting place of a number of Hollywood 
luminaries, including Mary Pickford, W. C. Fields, Humphrey Bogart, Spencer 
Tracy, Nat (King) Cole, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Jean Harlow and Errol 
Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
Six Flags Magic Mountain in the Santa Clarita Valley pulled in 3.1 million 
visitors in 1988, most of whom were from Southern California. (Attendance 
increased almost 9% over 1987.) In fact, Magic Mountain officials regard the 
amusement park as a regional, rather than a national, attraction. "We're 
basically a Southern California park for Southern Californians," said Courtney 
Simmons, a park spokesman. The park's newest ride, Tidal Wave, opened June 3, 
and park officials say it is operating at full capacity -- 1,200 people an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
While it is the major attractions such as Magic Mountain, Universal and NBC 
that bring tourists in, some not-so-obvious spots keep them here. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of things to do in the Valley," said Nancy Hoffman of the Van 
Nuys Chamber of Commerce, who said her office receives daily calls from 
out-of-state tourists wanting to know about local fairs, art shows and parks. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our calls are from people who want to know about shopping malls," 
Hoffman said. "Compulsive shoppers live everywhere. And don't forget the tour 
of the Van Nuys Airport." 
</P>
<P>
While tours are available at almost all airports in Southern California, only 
at Van Nuys can one regularly get a visit of an Air National Guard C-130 
Hercules as part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photograph Aircraft 
</P>
<P>
While most of the 2,500 monthly visitors are local school groups studying 
transportation, airport employee Dolly Hickland said, "many foreigners, 
especially the English and the Japanese, like to photograph the older World War 
II-era aircraft parked here." 
</P>
<P>
Not too far away, tourists are also coming to see the Sherman Oaks Galleria. 
"From the inside, it looks just like the ones we have in St. Paul," Marsha 
Libby said while taking a recent tour of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, but the malls of the Twin Cities haven't been constantly used in such 
movies and television shows as "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," "Commando," 
"Innerspace" and "thirtysomething." Galleria General Manager Jonathan Alpert 
said that because of these starring roles, some out-of-towners come to the mall 
strictly to take a look. 
</P>
<P>
"It's families with younger kids, teen-agers and older adults. One of the 
things they really wanted to see while in Los Angeles was the Sherman Oaks 
Galleria," Alpert said. "I was in Denver talking to someone and when I told 
them what I did, they said, 'I've got to see that place when I go to Los 
Angeles.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marriages, Masses Performed 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Mission in Mission Hills, which still performs marriages, 
baptisms and Sunday Masses, draws an estimated 35,000 visitors each year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen so much stucco in my life," Marvin Beglighter of Ennis, Tex., 
said when asked what he thought of the Valley while touring the mission. 
"Haven't you people ever heard of bricks?" 
</P>
<P>
It was spots such as the mission and the endless rows of citrus groves in 
pre-subdivision times that enticed tourists of the 1920s and '30s to venture 
over into the Valley, especially Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of Europeans wanted to come and see the endless rows of citrus," Valley 
historian Elva Meline said from her office in the Andreas Pico Adobe in Mission 
Hills. "To see an orange growing on a tree was really something for these 
people. And the movie industry was very busy out here in the '30s too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Tours 
</P>
<P>
One of the oldest buildings in the Valley, the Pico Adobe draws about 5,000 
people per year, primarily school tours from as far away as Ridgecrest and 
Tehachapi and those who find reference to it in the AAA tour guide book. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, about 150,000 people, 40% of whom are from out of state, visit the 
155-acre Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge. "Anyone who is a camellia 
fancier from around the world knows about us," said spokesman Paul McBride. 
"We're also well-known for our collection of roses." 
</P>
<P>
One of the best-kept secrets in the Valley is the Japanese garden in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant operated by the city of 
Los Angeles, the 6 1/2-acre garden "was built as a relief to the traditional 
square boxes this type of facility inevitably becomes," spokesman Gene Greene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people visit the garden each month (by appointment only), 35% of 
whom are from out of state. They can gaze at azaleas, cherry trees, magnolias, 
wisteria, iris and lotus as they walk.

3 GROUPS SEEK TO PRODUCE 'FREEDOM FESTIVAL' DURING SOVIET EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLIARD HARPER, San Diego County Arts Writer 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three organizations have submitted proposals to produce a "freedom festival" to 
run concurrently with the Treasures of the Soviet Union arts festival in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council earmarked $30,000 for a freedom festival last September as a 
response to critics' complaints about worldwide victims of Soviet aggression. 
However, the city manager's May request for proposals made no reference to 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
The groups, which are competing for a city grant of up to $30,000, are Prophet 
World Beat Productions, organized originally several years ago to present 
"Third World shows" in San Diego; the Avenue of the Arts, which produces the 
arts and crafts street fair during downtown's Artwalk and is sponsored by the 
Llan Lael Foundation, and Freedom Festival Inc., a nonprofit organization 
specifically formed to produce the festival. The proposals include a series of 
Japanese and African dance workshops and concerts, a fine art street fair of 
works by San Diego artists and a multi-ethnic cultural fest. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom Festival Inc. plans a variety of folk concerts and arts and crafts 
displays featuring 16 ethnic groups, according to Debra Schettino, a 
spokeswoman for the group. Highlights of the proposed festival include an 
exhibit of 16th-Century Bezhad-style Persian paintings, 400 decorative Pysanky 
Easter eggs and a concert by Royal Thai dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Also proposed are displays of Vietnamese miniature art and lacquer ware, 
Laotian paintings and silverwork, a Hmong needlework collection, Mexican 
serigraphs and watercolors and a concert by a local Ukrainian choir, Schettino 
said. The proposal calls for a three-week festival, budgeted at $56,000, 
located primarily in Balboa Park and running concurrently with the festival of 
Soviet arts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've asked all segments of society to participate," Schettino said. "We 
didn't go just for the heavy political freedom things. We want to impact the 
art community of San Diego as well." Freedom Inc. also plans education 
programs, videos, lectures, and arts and crafts workshops, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schettino, who proposed a Freedom Arts Festival at a City Council meeting last 
year, has been one of the chief critics of the Soviet arts festival. Responding 
to Schettino's proposal and criticisms by her and others, the City Council in 
September earmarked $30,000 -- 1% of the $3 million awarded to the San Diego 
Arts Festival by the council -- for an alternative "freedom festival." 
</P>
<P>
Freedom Inc. plans to raise $26,000 through donations and earned income to meet 
the city's stated preference that an arts group raise at least $15,000 if it is 
to receive the $30,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
Prophet World Beat Productions has proposed an International Dance Music 
Festival featuring artists from Ghana and Japan. The proposal is built around 
the visit of nine members of Japan's Mariko Dance Troupe and a 12-member 
performance group from Ghana, featuring master drummer Obo Addy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main language is music, as well as dance," said Ruben Seja, of Prophet 
World Beat Productions. "It's free. Our aim is to get the inner city kids to 
open their eyes to the variety of music and dance available." 
</P>
<P>
Prophet World Beat Productions was founded about seven years ago by Marianne 
Makeda Cheatom, originally to present the arts of Africa and Jamaica. Since 
then the organization has produced arts events from a number of countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariko Dance Troupe was chosen because it mixes traditional and modern 
Japanese dance, Seja said. World Beat's proposal calls for a week of concerts 
and workshops. The dance concerts, which will involve local dancers along with 
the Ghanians, will be in the Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park. Seja plans to 
present a series of dance workshops at recreational centers in north and south 
county communities. 
</P>
<P>
World Beat has lined up about $20,000 in grants from two Japanese companies, 
Seja said. The total budget for its proposal is $44,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Avenue of the Arts' budget, in contrast the budgets for the other two 
groups, totals just $18,200, said Lynne Walker, the group's spokeswoman. Walker 
said the plan requires a four-block street closing, at a location to be 
announced, on Nov. 11 and 12, the final weekend of the Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have up to 120 booths for San Diego County artists to show, 
demonstrate or sell, at no cost to the artists," Walker said. "We'll have one 
and a half blocks of ethnic food booths and one block of hands-on activities 
for kids, like mask making, working in clay and painting." 
</P>
<P>
The Avenue of the Arts plan calls for a juried art exhibit. Walker also plans 
to use a jury-like panel to screen booth applicants to obtain "higher quality 
work. We're hoping to have more fine arts and not T-shirt booths," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker is requesting only $14,000 in a city subsidy, she said. The remaining 
$4,200 will be raised from participation fees for the food booths and through 
the estimated purchases of canopies, which all booths must have. 
</P>
<P>
Walker and Carol Dunn, who founded and operated the Avenue of the Arts the past 
three years during Artwalk, view their proposed event as a bridge between the 
last weekend of the Soviet Arts Festival and National Arts Week, which begins 
the following week. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to have a mini-Artwalk" in which artists' studios and galleries are 
open to the public, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
The three proposals will be reviewed by a panel of city staff members and 
members of the Commission for Arts and Culture. The panel will make a 
recommendation later this summer to the full commission, which will award the 
grant.

South Korean authorities Wednesday refused to allow 40 Christian youths and 
newspaper reporters to attend a festival in North Korea, saying their 
participation would harm national interests. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal confirmed an earlier ban on South Koreans taking part in the 13th 
World Festival of Youth and Students, scheduled July 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea has invited about 500 South Korean students and dissidents to join 
in the sports, cultural and political event, attended mainly by students from 
Third World and Communist nations. 
</P>
<P>
Seoul accuses Pyongyang of using the festival to dramatize its demand for the 
withdrawal of U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.

As police officers searched for the snake, the owner warned that the 5-year-old 
female reptile was a threat to small children and animals. "I feed her every 
Sunday, but she hadn't been fed before she left, so she's hungry," said Snow 
Collett, 20. The snake's diet consists of pigeons, chickens and rats, she said, 
but it has been known to attack people. The boa squeezes its prey to death.

MERCHANT SEAMEN'S FLOATING MEMORIAL UNWELCOME AT PORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The merchant ship Lane Victory, a hulking, 455-foot-long, 7,000-ton vessel that 
had been mothballed near San Francisco for two decades, has made its grand 
entrance at the Port of Los Angeles, where it is tied up at Berth 55 and is 
creating quite a stir. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Harbor Department doesn't want it there. 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't stopped a feisty bunch of crusty old seamen who are trying to 
convert the former cargo ship into a museum that would honor their comrades who 
died at sea. Last week, the group, members of the U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans 
World War II, defied port officials and arranged for their ship to be towed to 
Los Angeles Harbor, knowing they had no place to berth it. 
</P>
<P>
"They were towed down from San Francisco, essentially without a place to go," 
Harbor Department spokeswoman Julia Nagano said. "They had no prior 
authorization." 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the possibility of having a homeless, non-functional ship in 
port, the Harbor Department -- aware of the public relations blunder it might 
create by turning the veterans away -- told the seamen that they could use the 
temporarily vacant Berth 55 for a week. 
</P>
<P>
The week was up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But the ship is still there. 
</P>
<P>
And the veterans, claiming port officials are money-hungry and unwilling to 
make room for them, staged a press conference on board the Lane Victory on 
Tuesday to call attention to their campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to stay right here," declared 76-year-old Joseph B. Vernick of 
North Hollywood, the president of the group. "We have no place to go. We're 
orphans." 
</P>
<P>
Replied Nagano: "It is unfortunate that the port is being accused of being 
insensitive to this project. We're sympathetic to their needs and we are 
concerned, but we do need to maintain the efficient operation of the port." 
</P>
<P>
The standoff between the Harbor Department and the veterans was resolved, 
temporarily at least, when the department told the seamen that they could have 
until this coming Monday to move. As of Wednesday afternoon, the seamen were 
still on board the Lane Victory and Vernick was working the phones, trying to 
drum up political support and arrange for a negotiating session with harbor 
officials, in an attempt to buy the ship even more time. 
</P>
<P>
Such tactics are nothing new to the Long Beach-based U.S. Merchant Marine 
Veterans World War II, a nationwide group of nearly 7,000 merchant seamen. This 
week's dispute with the Harbor Department is just the latest twist in a battle 
that the tenacious merchant seamen have been waging for years from a cramped 
office on the fifth floor of the U.S. Post Office building in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the veterans began trying to persuade the federal government to give 
them a ship that they could convert into a floating memorial. Last year, after 
U.S. Rep. Glenn Anderson (D-San Pedro) took up their cause, Congress finally 
agreed. What the seamen got was the 44-year-old Lane Victory, built at Los 
Angeles Harbor and used to ferry supplies and ammunition to U.S. troops during 
World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's interior is remarkably intact. The bunks are still made up with blue 
blankets and white pillowcases, and the file cabinets are full of interesting 
finds -- including a nearly complete set of invasion plans, marked "top 
secret," for Iwo Jima, Okinawa and the Japanese Islands, and 20-year-old 
letters of reprimand in which AWOL merchant seamen had their pay docked at the 
rate of $22 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This here is a treasure trove," said Fred Ripley, a volunteer with the Los 
Angeles Maritime Museum who has been working with the merchant seamen. 
</P>
<P>
And so what if its hull is a little bit rusty and its engine doesn't work? 
"Cosmetics, that's all cosmetics," Vernick insists. "It's a cream puff." 
</P>
<P>
While that may be overstating things, Vernick and his fellow seamen -- most of 
them retired -- believe that they will have no trouble refurbishing the ship 
themselves. They want to open the Lane Victory to tourists within a year, in 
much the same fashion as their counterparts in Baltimore and Northern 
California have done with other merchant marine ships, such as the Jeremiah 
O'Brien, which is berthed at Ft. Mason, near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Vernick's group must find a berth. That's where the Los Angeles 
Harbor Department comes in. 
</P>
<P>
The seamen have demanded that harbor officials give them Berth 87 at the Port 
of Los Angeles as a permanent home for their ship. That berth, in San Pedro, is 
near the Los Angeles Maritime Museum and a statue that honors merchant marine 
veterans, as well as other tourist attractions, such as the port's World Cruise 
Center and Ports O'Call Village. 
</P>
<P>
To the seamen, Berth 87 is the perfect -- indeed, the only -- site for the 
memorial, which Vernick said will be "dedicated to the thousands of merchant 
mariners that perished fighting for freedom to make this harbor what it is 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Port officials, however, are trying to lease Berth 87, which is now unoccupied 
but houses a cargo container terminal. The terminal brings about $2 million a 
year in revenue to the port, according to Mark Richter, assistant director of 
property management. 
</P>
<P>
"But the compensation is not the point," Richter said. "The point is that we 
are short of cargo space and we're hardly in a position to declare a terminal 
of this kind surplus." 
</P>
<P>
"It is out of the question," Nagano added. "Not a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Port officials want the seamen to consider a berth in Wilmington, but Vernick 
and the others won't hear of it. They say the Wilmington site, in an area that 
is slated for redevelopment, won't be ready for tourists for at least another 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer of Free Tow 
</P>
<P>
The aging veterans don't want to wait. As Vernick said recently: "Let's face 
it. I want to see the ship down here before I kick the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
So last week, when the seamen received an offer to have the Lane Victory towed 
from Suisun Bay to Los Angeles free of charge, they took it. "Greatest thing 
that ever happened to us," Vernick said, although he acknowledged that he is 
not quite certain what will happen next. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials say they know what will happen: If the Lane Victory is not gone 
from Berth 55 by Monday, they will tow it out into San Pedro Bay and anchor it. 
</P>
<P>
Vernick, however, remains confident that compromise is coming, both on the 
short-term use of Berth 55 and the long-term use of Berth 87. "Ultimately," he 
said, "we're going to win out. There's no question in my mind."

2 L.A. MAFIA INFORMANTS GET PROBATION

Two former Mafia brothers who went undercover for the government and collected 
evidence against the Los Angeles crime family had their jail sentences 
suspended Wednesday for work that authorities said dealt a "knockout punch" to 
the mob in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Anthony Fiato, 45, and Lawrence Fiato, 34, longtime organized crime 
associates who were among the first government informants to be considered for 
induction into the Mafia, were sentenced to five years' probation and fines of 
$1,000 each for the illegal loan-sharking activities that first led them into 
the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
"They worked on the streets, undercover, risking their lives on a daily basis 
for a period of almost two years," said former organized crime strike force 
chief James Henderson, one of a small cadre of prosecutors and FBI agents who 
supported the Fiato brothers' request for a lenient sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to the court, prosecutor Richard A. Stavin said the Fiatos' 
undercover work resulted in the indictment and conviction of reputed Los 
Angeles Mafia boss Peter J. Milano and his top lieutenants, along with four 
other indictments against a variety of organized crime figures -- a total of 31 
in all -- on a variety of racketeering, loan-sharking, fraud and extortion 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
The two brothers had a lucrative loan-sharking operation running in February, 
1984, when, suddenly aware that the FBI knew of their activities, they signed 
an agreement to go undercover and collect evidence against their former 
criminal associates. 
</P>
<P>
"During this most dangerous of assignments, the Fiato brothers wore concealed 
body recorders and taped telephone conversations to assist them in gathering 
evidence against La Cosa Nostra," Stavin said in his report to the court. "The 
slightest indiscretion by either brother at this time could have resulted in 
either serious physical injury or death." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said Larry Fiato foiled a hit against a suspected mob informant and 
yet salvaged the investigation when he faked his own traffic arrest after being 
ordered to go kill the informant. Craig Fiato, authorities said, was twice 
nearly discovered wearing a hidden tape recorder when patted down by his Mafia 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Valuable Service' 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez said the Fiatos' own loan-sharking 
activities -- accompanied with threats of violence against debtors who didn't 
pay up -- represented "a serious offense, indeed a repulsive offense." By law, 
the judge could have sentenced them to up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
"However, (they) rendered an extremely valuable service to the government in 
breaking up the power structure of the Mafia here in Southern California," 
Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Even living in a new location under new identities (Craig is writing a book 
about what he calls "the disadvantages" of crime; Larry is going to college, 
where he is president of the philosophy club), prosecutors say the brothers 
"remain virtual prisoners of their pasts -- with the constant fear that there 
are many within the Los Angeles La Cosa Nostra and elsewhere who will not 
forget their betrayal." 
</P>
<P>
"Six years of my life, wearing that wire, dying everyday," Craig said as he 
prepared to go into court Wednesday. "The slightest bit of stress, I fall 
apart. . . . But you know, we really crossed the line now. We crossed the 
line."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNMAN, 20, FATALLY SHOT BY OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reputed gang member was shot and killed by a Los Angeles police undercover 
detective Wednesday morning after he refused officers' orders to freeze and 
reached for a loaded shotgun, police said. The incident occurred in the 1800 
block of Rodeo Road, while officers were serving subpoenas in the Southwest Los 
Angeles area, said Lt. William Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Michael Page, 20, was "crossing the street, armed with a shotgun 
and a bottle," Hall said. Detective Claude Woods, 49, a 22-year LAPD veteran, 
ordered Page to stop, but the suspect instead appeared to reach for the gun, 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall fired one shot and hit Page in the chest. Page turned and ran a short 
distance before he collapsed and died, Hall said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD OKS KEY BUDGET CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cuts in a computer literacy program, "combat pay" for inner-city administrators 
and staff cars were approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles Board of Education, 
which faces at least $44 million in budget reductions in order to pay for 
employee raises. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted to reduce by 50% the district's share of a computer literacy 
program, which saves $404,000 next year. It also agreed to take away 
district-paid cars from 41 administrators, including division heads and 
assistant and associate superintendents, which had cost $124,701. 
</P>
<P>
Another reduction will affect administrators in inner-city areas. The board 
voted to reduce by 25% the salary differential those administrators receive 
because of the location of their schools, commonly called "combat pay." The 
savings will amount to $350,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"These cuts are extremely painful for the people making them," said board 
member Julie Korenstein. "We leave each day feeling cut to the bone 
personally." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the $42 million in cuts approved so far have been supported by 
Korenstein, Jackie Goldberg, Warren Furutani and board President Roberta 
Weintraub, the four board members who voted in favor of a 24%, three-year 
salary increase teachers won after a strike in May. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Gershman, Leticia Quezada and Rita Walters have opposed most of the cuts.

PRELIMINARY HEARINGS RISK FAIRNESS FOR JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It surely is no consolation to movie mogul Robert Evans -- named in court this 
week as having ordered the 1983 murder of producer Roy Radin -- but defense 
lawyers ardently support the California criminal procedure known as the 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
It was during such a pretrial proceeding that a witness named William Rider 
testified Tuesday that he had heard a defendant in the "Cotton Club" murder 
case mention Evans' name in connection with Radin's killing. 
</P>
<P>
While defense attorneys approve of the preliminary hearing system because it 
gives them a chance to review prosecutors' cases, prosecutors often complain 
that defense lawyers use them to endlessly drag on criminal cases. And for 
those like Evans, accused of a murder during the proceeding without ever having 
been formally charged, there is little legal recourse. 
</P>
<P>
"What is said in a legal proceeding has absolute privilege," Los Angeles County 
Public Defender Wilbur Littlefield said. "You can't file a defamation action. 
You just have to take it. There's no question that it's unfair." 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing is a pretrial criminal procedure intended to satisfy a 
judge that the government has sufficient evidence -- or probable cause -- to 
prosecute a person. Thirty-two states, including California, require such 
hearings, and 25 use them instead of grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Cotton Club" case, four defendants are being charged with murdering 
Radin, a New York theatrical producer. Although the former Paramount Pictures 
production chief has not been charged in the case, prosecutors have pointedly 
refused to rule him out as a murder suspect. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, when Evans was called as the first witness in the preliminary 
hearing, he declined to answer any questions on the advice of his attorney, 
invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
California's municipal courts conduct about 100,000 felony preliminary hearings 
annually, at a cost of about $65 million. Most of them last less than half an 
hour, although a few can drag on for many months, such as in the McMartin child 
molestation case and the Night Stalker case here in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court Ruling 
</P>
<P>
In California, a 1978 state Supreme Court ruling granted criminal defendants 
the right to have preliminary hearings even after an indictment by a grand 
jury, whose proceedings take place behind closed doors. As a result of that 
ruling, the use of grand juries to indict criminal suspects has become 
practically a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors generally are not critical of preliminary hearings per se, although 
they often complain of their length, blaming defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said he and many other 
prosecutors throughout the state would like to go back to the option of using 
either a grand jury indictment or a preliminary hearing, thus taking away a 
defendant's right to preliminary hearing even after a grand jury indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Had this option been available, Livesay said, a grand jury proceeding might 
have prevented Evans' name from surfacing publicly as a possible murder 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
In rare instances -- although not in the "Cotton Club" hearing -- a judge can 
close a preliminary hearing to the public and the press. It can be done, for 
instance, if a judge believes that a defendant's right to a fair and impartial 
trial may be jeopardized by undue publicity resulting from the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sufficient Suspicion 
</P>
<P>
In preliminary hearings, the same rules of evidence generally apply as in 
trials. At the end of the hearing, the presiding judge -- Municipal Judge Patti 
Jo McKay in the "Cotton Club" case -- must decide whether a crime has been 
committed and, if so, whether there is sufficient suspicion that a defendant 
committed that crime. 
</P>
<P>
If so, the judge will order the case transferred to Superior Court for 
arraignment and trial. Otherwise, the case is dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal defense lawyers tend to prefer preliminary hearings to grand jury 
proceedings because, they say, it gives them a chance to preview the 
prosecution's case, typically through extensive questioning of witnesses and a 
thorough examination of documents. 
</P>
<P>
"In preliminary hearings, you get a look at what you're up against. It's a very 
fair system," said F. Lee Bailey, the Boston-based defense lawyer who 
frequently appears in California courts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expedite Proceedings 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary hearings can also serve to expedite proceedings by prompting some 
defendants to plea bargain, having been convinced of the strength of the 
prosecution's case, said Charles Sevilla, a prominent San Diego criminal 
defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla, Bailey and most defense lawyers are vigorous supporters of preliminary 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"I favor them," Bailey said. "They are terribly important. And yet, the 
consequences can be very severe -- even if a person is eventually acquitted at 
trial, especially if you are a businessman."

CARWASH'S BID FOR CULTURAL STATUS HASN'T GONE DOWN THE DRAIN YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some called the idea frivolous and a joke, but that didn't stop Los Angeles 
city officials from refusing to scrub a proposal Wednesday to make a San 
Fernando Valley carwash a city cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they gave it a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Cultural Heritage Commission were split 2 to 1 in favor of 
declaring a 1950s-style carwash at Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards as the 
official "Gateway to the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
But because three votes are needed before cultural monument status can be 
granted, the commissioners decided to postpone voting on the proposal until 
after the nomination of a fourth commissioner goes before the City Council next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Commission President Amarjit Marwah said newcomer Reynald R. Landero will be 
asked to inspect the carwash site if he is approved for the panel Tuesday; the 
commission will resume debate on the issue July 19. 
</P>
<P>
"If it fails, if fails. But at least it will give us a chance," said Marwah, 
who supports designating the carwash as a cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
The carwash, along with an adjoining gas station and coffee shop, could become 
the city's 321st such monument if it wins the commission's approval. From 
there, the proposal will be sent to the City Council's Recreation, Library and 
Cultural Affairs subcommittee before going to the full council for its 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural monument status is being sought by Valley homeowners as a way of 
thwarting construction of a $15-million mini-mall on the carwash's corner. Such 
a designation would block demolition of the carwash, an adjoining Unocal 
station and a Tiny Naylor's restaurant for one year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ready to Start' 
</P>
<P>
Developer Ira Smedra, who condemned the request as frivolous, said his proposed 
two-story retail center has already won routine city approval. "I'm ready to 
start construction tomorrow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smedra said he is dismayed by the stir the carwash monument plan has caused. In 
recent weeks, the proposal has attracted worldwide attention -- often being 
described as the latest example of Los Angeles' wacky love affair with the 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a terrible abuse of the system," Smedra said of the monument request, 
pledging that his proposed shopping center would be larger and nicer than 
mini-malls that have popped up on former gas station sites throughout Los 
Angeles during the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
But carwash supporters who jammed a small commission conference room said the 
car culture is of particular importance to commuters living in the Valley's 
suburbs. They said the 28-year-old carwash's three 55-foot-tall 
boom-erang-shaped towers have made it a true landmark for motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Among the crowd of 75 were Pat Galati, who has operated the gas station at the 
corner since 1954, and a group of uniformed Tiny Naylor's waitresses led by 
Jeri Maier. She has served hamburgers, pancakes and daily specials for the 
coffee shop chain for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not be as grand as the St. Louis Gateway to the West, but it is our 
gateway," Studio City neighborhood leader Walter McIntyre said of the carwash 
boomerangs. 
</P>
<P>
Added Jack McGrath, organizer of the save-the-carwash campaign: "In this crazy 
world of Los Angeles, the carwash gives you 15 minutes to stop and smell the 
roses, to watch the suds. It's a chance for dad and son to talk a little bit 
while their car is going through the wash." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hays, past president of the Studio City Chamber of Commerce, said his 
business group has joined homeowners in opposing construction of a mini-mall on 
the carwash site. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, the women all want their faces lifted and the developers all 
want to tear everything down," Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
Smedra's position was supported by Debra Mitz, a historical researcher with an 
architectural planning firm working on his shopping center project. She traced 
the history of the carwash to one built in 1914 in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Mitz told commissioners that the Studio City carwash was not the first one 
built in Valley. And she charged that its eye-catching three-legged boomerang 
tower is not unique to Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
"Subconsciously or consciously, it was copied from this," Mitz said, unrolling 
a 30-year-old blueprint for a West Covina restaurant named Thunderburger. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that the southeastern corner of the Valley owes more of its heritage 
to the movie industry than to the car, Mitz asserted that professional 
historians view the carwash landmark application as "a joke." 
</P>
<P>
"The professional community is very disturbed by this nomination," she said. 
"This would really trivialize the history of Studio City."

'COTTON CLUB' WITNESS SAYS FLYNT HAS CONTRACT OUT ON HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prosecution's key witness in the ongoing "Cotton Club" murder hearing, 
William Rider, testified Wednesday that he and his family have gone into hiding 
because Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt put a $70,000 price tag on his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman, called the allegation -- only the latest of a 
string of death threat allegations made by Rider -- "absurd" and said it stems 
from a 5-year-old employment dispute between the publisher and Rider, Flynt's 
former brother-in-law and security chief. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrongful Termination Suit 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Rider sued Flynt for wrongful termination, Isaacman said. That suit, 
scheduled to come to trial this fall in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges 
emotional distress and seeks several million dollars in damages. Isaacman said 
he believed Rider was making the murder contract allegation against Flynt in 
order to influence the outcome of his civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry put no contracts out on anybody," Isaacman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rider maintained that he is afraid of a long list of potential assailants: 
private investigators, drug traffickers, people on the periphery of law 
enforcement, people employed by Flynt and -- as he contended in testimony 
earlier in the week -- the "Cotton Club" defendants. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rider testified that a Cotton Club defendant told him that 
Hollywood producer Robert Evans and another defendant ordered the killing of 
theatrical producer Roy Radin in 1983. Evans has not been charged in the 
killing, but prosecutors refuse to rule him out as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the Cotton Club defendants, 29-year-old Alex Lamotta Marti, who 
Rider said first told him of Flynt's $70,000 murder contract. Marti and another 
defendant, William Mentzer, had both worked for Rider at one time as Flynt's 
bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is apparently taking some of Rider's fears 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Protected as part of the county's witness protection program, Rider has been 
collecting cash payments of as much as $3,000 a month from the district 
attorney's office since he began cooperating with sheriff's investigators a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Rider's testimony in the "Cotton Club" hearing, he has been 
accompanied by two or more plainclothes deputies who act as his bodyguards in 
the courtroom. Everyone entering Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Patti 
Jo McKay's courtroom is checked with a metal detector. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Rider added Isaacman and Hustler magazine's general counsel David 
Kahn to the list of those he fears might conspire to harm him or his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he wants to destroy his credibility all by himself," Kahn told The 
Times. "At some point you have to sit back and say, 'Oh, really?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Make You Wonder' 
</P>
<P>
"People who go around with a shotgun approach make you wonder," Kahn said. "If 
someone told you that (former House) Speaker (Jim) Wright was doing something 
wrong, you might listen, but if they told you every single member of Congress 
was up to no good, wouldn't you wonder?" 
</P>
<P>
Rider is the prosecution's sixth witness in a preliminary hearing to determine 
whether to bring Marti, Mentzer and alleged Florida drug dealer Elayne (Lanie) 
Greenberger to trial on charges of conspiring to murder Radin. Radin's body was 
found in a canyon northeast of Los Angeles six years ago, the apparent victim 
of an execution. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe Greenberger ordered Mentzer, Marti and a third former Flynt 
bodyguard to kill Radin because he was trying to cut her out of a deal 
involving the financing of the movie "Cotton Club."

An article concerning "Cotton Club" murder witness William Rider in Thursday's

Rider up to $3,000 a month. In fact, the district attorney paid Rider for some 
relocation expenses through the Victims Witness Assistance Program last year, 
but the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has been paying Rider $3,000 a 
month since the beginning of 1989.

HOLLYPARK CLERK IS SUSPENDED; MAN SOUGHT IN PICK NINE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mutuel clerk has been suspended and another man could face criminal charges 
in connection with a scheme involving the $1.38-million Pick Nine betting pool 
at Hollywood Park on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Bailey of Hawthorne, who has been a member of the local mutuel clerks' 
union since 1971, was suspended Wednesday for "conduct detrimental to racing." 
He allegedly gave a canceled Pick Nine ticket to an alleged accomplice who has 
been identified as James Farebaugh of La Crescenta, who in turn allegedly sold 
shares in the ticket to as many as six other patrons for a total of about 
$3,000 and then left the race track. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets that have been canceled by Hollywood Park's AmTote betting machines 
appear no different than valid tickets. When a ticket is canceled, clerks are 
required to tear or cut the ticket and secure it for collection at the end of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
The ticket in question -- which sold for $4,860 -- had all nine winners on the 
June 14 program. The scheme came to light when the bilked patrons began 
demanding their winnings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have creditable and corroborative evidence that (Bailey) intentional ly let 
this ticket back on the floor," said Bobby Taylor, Hollywood Park director of 
mutuels. "He was suspended indefinitely as of last Friday, and excluded from 
the grounds of the race track." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators for the California Horse Racing Board also are looking for 
Farebaugh, who could be charged with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, track officials are going over Bailey's log tapes -- records of 
all bet transactions at his window -- from both the current Hollywood Park 
meeting and this year's Santa Anita meeting to see if there were any other 
instances of suspiciously canceled tickets on large betting pools. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through Joe Stellino, president of the local clerks' 
union, Bailey declined comment on his suspension. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stellino said that Bailey is almost certain to lose his state license 
to work as a mutuel clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what they have, it doesn't look good for him," Stellino said. 
</P>
<P>
Special investigator Jeff Crandall of the CHRB said that a hearing will be held 
next week to seek revocation of Bailey's license. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall also is preparing a criminal complaint against the alleged accomplice 
Farebaugh, charging fraud. There is no criminal complaint being considered 
against Bailey at this time, Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
"This occurred on our property," said Crandall, formerly with the state police 
in Oakland. "As state investigators, we have the jurisdiction to work with the 
district attorney in filing a felony complaint." 
</P>
<P>
Crandall acknowledged that the "syndication" or reselling of tickets already 
purchased from a mutuel window is a relatively common occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no case law establishing that it's illegal to buy a ticket like that," 
Crandall said. "But to sell it is something else. It's a tout. It's against the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
The patrons who paid for shares of the canceled ticket and thought they had won 
might take civil action against Hollywood Park, according to one member of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these victims in this case are not really cooperating as you would 
expect victims to cooperate," Crandall said. "The whole point is, if you're 
going to buy a pari-mutuel ticket, you'd better buy it yourself."

BANKE, ZARAGOZA TO FIGHT TONIGHT AT THE FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long-awaited boxer-slugger matchup shapes up at the Forum tonight when Paul 
Banke of Quail Valley challenges Mexico's Daniel Zaragoza. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is Zaragoza's World Boxing Council super-bantamweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
Banke, 25, one-time amateur standout from Azusa, is 16-3 and has eight 
knockouts. Zaragoza, 31, of Mexico City, is 36-4-1 with 18 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
The bout was originally scheduled for last March, but Zaragoza suffered an 
eardrum injury during training. Another date was set, but the fight was 
postponed again when the ear injury was slow to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Banke, who fights for Bob Richardson's All-Heart Boxing Club in Quail Valley, 
lost three of his first 13 fights until he caught fire in 1988 and won the 
Forum's super-bantam tournament, earning $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
A flatfooted, free-swinging puncher, Banke has become a Forum boxing favorite. 
He's a hot fighter, having knocked out three of his last four opponents. He had 
two KOs in the Forum tournament, one in the 11th round over Carlos Romero in 
the championship bout. 
</P>
<P>
In his last Forum appearance, Jan. 9, in a rousing match, Banke knocked out 
Ramiro Adames insix. 
</P>
<P>
Zaragoza won the WBC's super-bantam championship in 1985 and lost it in his 
first defense. He regained the title in 1988 by stopping Carlos Zarate in 12 at 
the Forum last Feb. 29. He has since successfully defended twice, against Seung 
Lee Hoon of South Korea and Italian Valerio Nati. 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, the Forum super-featherweight tournament continues with two 
semifinal bouts, Robert Byrd vs. Javier Pichardo, and Jose Vidal vs. Raul 
Franco.

EVERT, SUFFERING FROM EAR INFECTION, MAY BE FORCED TO MISS WIMBLEDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

EASTBOURNE, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Evert withdrew Wednesday from a Wimbledon warm-up tournament because of 
an ear infection that may force her to miss next week's Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
Evert's infection left her dizzy and nauseous. A doctor who examined her said 
it could take anywhere from two days to a week for the illness to clear up. 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon starts its two-week run Monday, with Evert scheduled to play her 
first-round match against Peanut Harper on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Evert would be able to play by then, Dr. Geoffrey Wilson said, "That I 
cannot say. . . . No one can be sure." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Mill, the 34-year-old tennis star's husband, said Evert still hoped to 
play at Wimbledon, where she has reached at least the semifinals in all but one 
of her 17 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"She has had two weeks' practice on grass, but obviously she had been hoping to 
have a lot of match practice at Eastbourne this week," Mill said. "Now that is 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Evert was resting at her hotel in Eastbourne, and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The illness, which flared overnight after Evert beat Sara Gomer of Britain, 
6-2, 6-0, in the second round of the Pilkington Ladies' Grass-Court 
Championships, was the latest twist in the her quest to play at the All England 
Lawn Tennis Club at least one more time. 
</P>
<P>
Aiming to play in the French Open, where she has won a record seven singles 
titles, Evert returned to the European clay-court circuit in mid-May but lost a 
first-round match in Geneva to Barbara Paulus of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
She flew home to Florida and announced she was skipping the French Open because 
she lacked the motivation to win. 
</P>
<P>
But saying Wimbledon was her favorite tournament, Evert flew to England to 
prepare for the grass-court event.

TRIATHLETES TAKE DRUG TEST THAT THEY INITIATED

The first out-of-competition drug test for triathletes was given Wednesday at 
San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
The test was administered by the Triathlon Federation of the U.S.A. (TRIFED). 
The program was developed by members of the International Federation of Elite 
Triathletes (IFET). 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of being painted with the same brush as track and field athletes 
and football players," said Scott Zagarino, executive director of IFET. 
</P>
<P>
Registered letters were sent to 30 triathletes last week, ordering them to 
appear at the SDSU Student Health Service Wednesday afternoon. If an athlete 
signed for the letter and failed to appear, he was subject to suspension from 
triathlon competition for two years -- the same penalty as there is for using 
an illegal substance. SCOTT MILLER

KAREEM DENIES HE WILL PLAY IN ITALIAN LEAGUE; 
</P>
<P>
MAGIC SIDELINED FOR GAME; COOPER EXPECTS TRADE

From Associated Press

<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar says he won't be playing for a team in Italy. Magic Johnson 
won't be playing in Indianapolis. And Michael Cooper figures he might not be 
playing anymore in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar retired at 42 last week after the Lakers were swept by the Detroit 
Pistons in the National Basketball Assn. championship. The Italian sports 
daily, Corriere Dello Sport, then reported that two Italian pro teams were 
bidding for his services, and that he was seeking $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The report is not true, Abdul-Jabbar's publicist said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cooper said that he would not be surprised if he was traded by the 
Lakers, now that the team needs a center to replace Abdul-Jabbar, and it was 
confirmed that Johnson, who was forced out of the NBA Finals because of a 
hamstring injury, will miss the Larry Bird Pro All-Star Scholarship game Sunday 
night in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Lorin Pullman, Abdul-Jabbar's publicist, denied the Italian report. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not seeking any type of long-term basketball contract and has not 
received any kind of offer for that kind of money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Abdul-Jabbar in a statement issued through Pullman: "I'm committed to 
games on a world-wide basis. I'm not sure I want to be in regular team 
competition again." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar will play in Australia and Taiwan next month with a team of former 
NBA stars against national teams. The games are scheduled in Melbourne (July 
24), Sydney (July 26), Brisbane (July 28) and Taipei (July 30). 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Pullman said, Abdul-Jabbar will be concentrating on a career in 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
As for being involved in a possible Laker trade, Cooper said: "The Lakers need 
to make a move to get a center or to get someone to help fill that position. 
The talk is the Lakers don't want to break up the starting unit, and if I was 
the Lakers, I would agree with them. 
</P>
<P>
"And after the starters, Michael Cooper is the most marketable player they 
have. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have to make the move, I'll understand it. It's a pure business 
decision."

NEWSWIRE: HIGH JUMPER ADMITS TO USING STEROIDS BRIEFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Howard, a two-time Olympian and the former U.S. record-holder in the high 
jump, has admitted using anabolic steroids briefly in 1979, but said he gained 
too much weight and has not used them since. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5, 175-pound Howard, in an interview published Wednesday in the 
Toronto Sun, was responding to allegations made Tuesday by Canadian high jumper 
Milt Ottey at the the Canadian government's commission of inquiry into drug use 
by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, 29, who placed 10th at the Seoul Games said, "I'd be lying if I said I 
never tried them but I gained so much weight (from the drugs) I couldn't jump." 
</P>
<P>
Ottey had testified that a jumper at the 1984 Harry Jerome Games in Vancouver, 
British Columbia, tried not to finish in third place after it was announced 
that the winners and third-place finishers would be tested for drugs. Howard 
finished third but left after the competition before he could be tested.

LAZER COACH SAYS HE WON'T BE BACK; TEAM MAY FOLD

Keith Tozer, coach of the Los Angeles Lazers, said Wednesday night that he and 
assistant, Mike Mahoney, have not been rehired for next season. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the Major Indoor Soccer League office said the Lazers are 
expected to announce this week they will not play next season. 
</P>
<P>
Tozer said he was notified by management May 16 that there was a possibility 
the Lazers would fold. Lazer owner Jerry Buss, who has reportedly lost more 
than $7 million on the franchise since its inception, and MISL commissioner 
Earl Foreman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been taken out of the coaching role," said Tozer, who has been reassigned 
as director of marketing and advertising for boxing at the Forum. "The players 
have been notified that possibly something will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Tozer said he has suspected the franchise was having difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of felt it all season long," he said. "It became more and more 
apparent that at least something was going to happen. I hope at the age of 32 
that this is not my last chance to coach." 
</P>
<P>
All MISL teams are required to submit a $400,000 letter of credit by June 30. 
Without the Lazers, the league will likely consist of seven teams, including 
the Cleveland Crunch, an expansion franchise.

TEEN CELEBS TURN OUT FOR BOP BASH TOUTING POP'S NEW KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teen dream Kirk Cameron wasn't there (although his three sisters were), and 
Tiffany was a no-show. Otherwise, a Who's Who of teen-age Hollywood -- from 
Soleil Moon Frye of TV's "Punky Brewster" to "Growing Pains' " Jeremy Miller -- 
turned out for a party Tuesday night feting the hot new teen singing group, New 
Kids on the Block, who are as wholesome as the Osmonds. 
</P>
<P>
Still, just in case things got out of hand, party organizers had hired five 
beefy security guards in addition to the two who just look after the New Kids. 
(Also stationed outside was a phalanx of Chuck's parking valets who stood idle 
most of the time -- half of this crowd wasn't old enough to drive.) 
</P>
<P>
But as guests downed virgin mai tais, Coke and cases of designer water, it 
became clear that young Hollywood knows its P's and Q's. Pubescent entertainers 
arrive with their publicists or their parents in tow. They make eye contact and 
say "thank you" to reporters. They talk about the "Batman" premiere and their 
own upcoming work. Savvy Keith Coogan, 19, who appears in "Cousins" and 
"Adventures in Babysitting," says: "Coming this summer I'm in 'Cheetah and 
Friends' from Disney Films. Well, I gotta plug it. That's what I'm here for." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, just about the biggest shocker of this party was David Faustino, 15, 
of "Married With Children," who walked in holding a plastic cup from 
McDonald's, where he had eaten two burgers and a large order of fries before 
arriving. "I thought it might be like anchovies and stuff like that," Faustino 
said of the party fare. (Actually, it was fajitas, hamburgers, hot dogs and 
baby pizzas.) 
</P>
<P>
The event was hosted by Bop and the Big Bopper magazines. Julie Laufer, the 
magazines' 26-year-old editor, held court in her parents' Woodland Hills home, 
which had been equipped with a disco floor and a battery of speakers on which 
New Kids' hit song, "I'll Be Loving You (Forever)," replayed all evening long. 
</P>
<P>
In the crowd were Rain Pryor, 20, of "Head of the Class;" Jason Marsden, 14, of 
"The Munsters Today;" 12-year-old Brandon Call ("Formerly of 'The Champ' and 
'Santa Barbara,' " trumpeted his mother, Elyse); sisters Danica and Crystal 
McKellar of "The Wonder Years"; members of the pop group The Boys; 13-year-old 
modeling star Mila Jovovich, and Josh Harris, 10, of "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
Laufer, in a pink leather suit, predicted that New Kids will be bigger than the 
Osmonds. "I think they'll go beyond that just from the signs we've seen," she 
said knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
Her brother, Scott Laufer, 28, president of Laufer Publishing, envisions 
greatness even beyond that of Kirk Cameron, star of "Growing Pains" and 
perennial Bop cover boy. "They'll be at least three times hotter than Kirk, at 
least for selling magazines," he said. New Kids grace Bop's July cover, which 
is on its way to becoming the biggest seller in Bop's history, with anticipated 
newsstand sales of 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours late, three black Cadillac limousines snaked up the street 
carrying the Kids and their entourage. Although this was supposed to be the 
first chance for the five members of the Boston-based group to mingle with 
stars (they're in town to open for Tiffany at the Universal Amphitheatre on 
Sunday), they kind of stuck together. 
</P>
<P>
New Kid Jordan Knight, 18, said he didn't watch TV at all -- "I know it seems 
kind of funny, but I don't" -- and so he didn't recognize anyone. 
</P>
<P>
But Donny Wahlberg, 19, who wore a suit cut off at the knees, spats and white 
socks, ponytail and three earrings, said his head was elsewhere. "Lately, I've 
been in a deeper thought," he explained. "I mean, I appreciate having parties 
thrown in my honor. I enjoy it. But my main concern, and the group's main 
concern, is creating a better atmosphere for the youth of America. I'd rather 
make a better world than be rich and famous."

LEGAL VIEW: DINER IN RESTAURANT SINKS HER TEETH INTO A COURT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the soup is cold or the steak is overcooked, you can always send it back to 
the kitchen. But what can you do if you bite into a juicy hamburger patty and 
break a tooth? 
</P>
<P>
You can sue. 
</P>
<P>
That's the conclusion of a recent California Court of Appeal case. Patrice 
Evart broke a tooth when she bit into a hamburger and struck a hard object that 
felt like a piece of bone. She sued the manufacturer of the hamburger and the 
restaurant that served it, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles trial judge David M. Schacter dismissed the case before trial in 
late 1987, apparently convinced that a piece of bone was not a foreign object, 
but a natural product that a consumer should reasonably expect to encounter in 
a hamburger patty. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the appellate court overturned the dismissal, allowing the case to 
proceed to trial, after concluding that a jury should decide whether consumers 
can reasonably expect to find and guard against bones in ground beef. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Successful Suits 
</P>
<P>
There have been many cases in which customers successfully sued restaurants 
because of injuries they suffered from biting into food containing foreign 
objects such as glass or metal. What made this case a little unusual was the 
fact that the object that caused the injury was not strictly a foreign object, 
but a natural part of the foodstuff itself. 
</P>
<P>
However, it wasn't the first time a court faced the problem. Other cases 
involved cherry pies with cherry pits, turkey dressing with turkey bones and 
even an oyster containing a pearl. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1936 California Supreme Court case, a man's chicken-pot-pie dinner was the 
source of the controversy. Harry F. Mix was injured when he swallowed a sliver 
of a chicken bone. In that case, the court dismissed the lawsuit, saying that 
it is common knowledge that "chicken pies occasionally contained chicken 
bones." 
</P>
<P>
But in the hamburger patty case, the court wouldn't go that far. It is not 
common knowledge that bones are found in ground beef, the court ruled, and so a 
jury should determine whether anyone was negligent in allowing the bone to 
remain in the patty. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers use various theories to pursue these cases, including negligence, 
breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, and res ipsa loquitur, a 
Latin phrase meaning "the thing speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
As a consumer, you should know that a restaurant, its supplier, and even the 
local butcher may be responsible for your injury if food is not prepared 
properly. Before you rush off to retain a lawyer, however, you might try to 
resolve the problem informally, especially if your injuries are minor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Consultation 
</P>
<P>
Most lawyers will consult with you free of charge about a possible personal 
injury suit. These cases are usually handled on a contingency fee basis, which 
means you will pay the attorney from 25% to 50% of the recovery, but won't be 
charged if you don't win anything. 
</P>
<P>
If you are injured in a restaurant, make sure you register a complaint with 
management at the time of the injury. Save any relevant evidence, such as the 
piece of glass or bone. And keep track of the costs of your medical care. In 
addition to paying the medical bills, you should also be compensated for your 
pain and suffering.

YOUR STAMPS: U.S.-SOVIET EXCHANGE IS SUGGESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I haven't collected stamps systematically since high school, but I 
still find them fascinating. Last summer I joined 250 Americans and 200 Soviets 
for a peace walk from Leningrad to Moscow. Along the way I bought three small 
albums of Soviet stamps. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to me that it would be a good confidence-building step if stamp 
collectors in the United States and the U.S.S.R. corresponded and exchanged 
stamps. Especially young people. I believe the thousands of stamp collectors in 
both countries could do a lot toward lasting peace and international 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
What are some things I could do to get this idea off the ground? -- B.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is legal in both countries to exchange stamps by mail between 
collectors in the United States and the Soviet Union. I once carried on a 
3-year correspondence with a gentleman in the Ukraine, exchanging stamps and 
post cards as well as information about such subjects as our jobs and 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union has relaxed some 
of its "closed society" rules a bit, but you'll find mailing letters to and 
from Russia to be somewhat different from correspondence to Western Europe. 
Mail often gets lost or delayed for reasons that aren't always clear. 
</P>
<P>
Still, your idea has merit. Try writing to International Pen Friends, 9 Porter 
Road, Wolcott, Conn. 06716. Also: Papyrus, 7301-VD Jefferson N.E., No. A239, 
Albuquerque, N.M. 87109, and enclose a stamped envelope for a reply. Also: 
Philatelic Department, V/O Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga, Moscow 121200, U.S.S.R., and 
tell them you want to trade stamps with Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can I verify if a stamp dealer in a foreign country is legitimate and 
ethical? -- R.A. 
</P>
<P>
A: This is hard without trying a few sample orders to see what kind of service 
and value you get. There is an organization that many foreign dealers belong 
to, and you could write to them and ask if they are aware of the dealer you are 
investigating. Contact Philatelic Trader's Society, 27 John Adams St., London 
WC2N 6HZ, England. Enclose a dollar to help pay for their reply. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A pen pal in the Philippines sent me a set of stamps illustrating President 
Aquino and other subjects, including a parade and the military. Do these have 
value? -- T.N. 
</P>
<P>
A: Issued in May, 1986, this set is too recent to be of great value: 85 cents 
mint, 43 cents used for the set of four.

Sanford L. Kane worked in finance jobs for most of his 27 years at IBM, but he 
says he's always enjoyed getting his hands dirty on the shop floor. That might 
be just the right combination for the venture he has been named to run, U.S. 
Memories Inc., which will have to combine manufacturing excellence with tight 
cost controls to prosper in the fiercely competitive computer memory chip 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't sit in my office and read reports. I got out onto the site," Kane 
said of a stint as controller of an IBM plant in Fishkill, N.Y. "The longer you 
spend in a place like that, the more you appreciate the genius" of the work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
A rotund man with a forceful public presence, Kane makes no bones about the 
fact that U.S. Memories, while a risky venture, represents a major personal 
opportunity for him. But he also emphasizes his belief that it is important for 
the industry and the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided this was important, that it was a challenge, that it was interesting 
and that it was a risk worth taking," he said, referring to his decision to 
resign as vice president of IBM's general technology division and become 
president and chief executive of U.S. Memories. 
</P>
<P>
In an indirect way, Kane also had another motive: to plunge into something that 
would help him forget the 1986 murder of his 16-year-old son, Eric. The 
notorious incident, in which his son was stabbed to death in an Arizona motel 
room by the son of well-known author John Wideman, has left him bitter about 
the American justice system and committed to the victims' rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
His normally confident voice nearly cracked as he discussed the tragedy. "It's 
been very difficult, but we have each other," he said in reference to his wife, 
Louise, who is chairwoman of the New York State victims' rights league. "She 
nearly always travels with me now because neither one of us wants to be alone. 
And we need to be active; otherwise we'd be basket cases." In a notable 
departure from standard practice, Kane introduced his wife during the U.S. 
Memories news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Kane is clearly prepared to devote a lot of energy to U.S. Memories. And his 
skills as a negotiator and conciliator, which may prove vital in making a 
company with multiple owners a success, have been well-tested. He served 
several years as IBM's ambassador to the chip industry and was a key player in 
bringing the Sematech research consortium and U.S. Memories to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
To succeed, Kane will need the same "good sense for both business and 
technology and how they are related" that he attributes to Erich Bloch, head of 
the National Science Foundation. Bloch was Kane's boss at Fishkill, and Kane 
described him in admiring tones as "a very dedicated guy" who had a rare 
understanding of the way high-tech industries work. 
</P>
<P>
Kane is also clearly inspired by the potential for U.S. Memories. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching this develop over the years has been an incredible experience," he 
said of the budding industry cooperation. "In the early meetings, there was an 
incredible amount of distrust among the companies. But now they're really doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
And for the latest and most important phase of that cooperation, it will be 
Sandy Kane leading the way.

DRAMs, short for dynamic random access memories, are the heart of a computer's 
memory system. Pronounced DEE-rams, they allow computers and such electronic 
devices as fax machines to store bits of data for quick retrieval; some can 
manipulate information. DRAMs make up a computer's main memory bank and are 
typically used to store software programs and operating instructions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, 11 U.S. companies produced DRAMs: AMD, AMI, Fairchild, Intel, ITT, 
Micron, Mostek, Motorola, National, TI and Zilog. Now only three U.S. firms 
manufacture and market them: Texas Instruments, Micron Technology and Motorola. 
DRAM growth will be fueled by advanced electronics and new applications; one 
forecaster estimates that DRAM capacity in printers, PCs, personal copiers, fax 
machines, intelligent workstations and TVs will show the most dramatic growth. 
</P>
<P>
DRAM MARKET SHARE 
</P>
<P>
North American companies' share of the DRAM market has plummeted over the past 
decade. 1989 figures are estimates.

'SCALPEL, CLAMPS. . .' -- DISCOUNTER TO OFFER WAREHOUSE FULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer

<P>
In search of bargains, Southern Californians flock to Home Club for kitchen 
sinks, Office Club for paper clips and Price Club for just about everything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Now they can hunt for the best price on a wheelchair, a deep-heat massager or a 
glucose monitor at MedChoice. 
</P>
<P>
In a giant warehouse popularized by chains like Price Club, MedChoice will 
offer 6,500 products, from lab coats and latex gloves to dental bonding systems 
and tongue depressors. 
</P>
<P>
MedChoice, which opens its first Southern California store Friday in Fountain 
Valley, will cater to doctors and dentists, and many items will be off limits 
to those without a medical license. But the general public is expected to 
account for about a third of MedChoice's sales. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everybody's ready for it, but just like with office and home supplies, the 
business of selling medical supplies needs shaking up, and we're doing it," 
MedChoice Chief Executive Vern Stigge said. 
</P>
<P>
MedChoice, financed by some of the investors who started the Office Club chain, 
is convinced that the same marketing principle applies to medical products as 
office and home supplies. The theory holds that buying goods in huge volumes, 
displaying them in a low-overhead warehouse setting and selling to an 
established membership base can lead to profits. 
</P>
<P>
Founder Ted Morgan, also a founder of Office Club, said he developed the 
MedChoice concept two years ago because he saw that the medical supply market 
was dominated by small vendors, just as the market for office supplies was. 
</P>
<P>
The distribution by the small, often family-owned businesses meant profit 
margins as high as 40% for distributors, he said, compared to margins of 10% to 
15% for retailers in the discount business. By buying in large volumes and 
eliminating sales reps, MedChoice says it has cut margins to about 20% at its 
two stores in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Others are skeptical of the MedChoice strategy. Critics contend that the 
medical supply business is not as sensitive to prices as other industries, that 
doctors place great value on service from their sales representatives and that 
they have long-term relationships with sales representatives that would be 
difficult to break. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a longstanding relationship with my supply salesperson," said Dr. 
Gerald McClellan, a Costa Mesa dentist, who is president of the Orange County 
Dental Society. "I'm not going to breach that for a couple of dollars of 
savings." 
</P>
<P>
George Aumiller, president of D&amp;M Enterprises, an Orange County dental 
products distributor with 350 customers, said the arrival of MedChoice will 
hurt some distributors but not radically change the way medical supplies are 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Membership Drive Successful 
</P>
<P>
"This market isn't as price sensitive as they think," Aumiller said. "I've been 
in the business 28 years, and I couldn't touch most of the business out there 
even if I came in at a lower price." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the company said its membership drive in Southern California is 
running ahead of expectations. So far, about 600 medical professionals have 
paid $25 for a one-year membership. Non-medical, individual members pay $10 a 
year to belong. Shoppers not wishing to buy a membership pay 10% more for 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
The company estimates that it can eventually sell memberships to 35% of the 
county's doctors and dentists. 
</P>
<P>
Stigge projects that the Fountain Valley store will have sales of about $5 
million in its first year. MedChoice estimates that the medical supplies market 
in Los Angeles and Orange counties is nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Dentist Jerry Malleus, who runs the San Fernando Dental Center, a four-dentist 
office, learned of MedChoice at an Anaheim dental show this spring and 
immediately joined. 
</P>
<P>
"I can save several thousand dollars a year there. For a dentist that's 
significant," said Malleus. He said MedChoice will ship him products until a 
store opens in his area. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Medical Assn. sent a letter to its members endorsing 
MedChoice's price-saving strategy, but other medical professionals expressed 
concern that some of the restricted products in the store could fall into the 
hands of the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those products are very caustic," said McClellan. 
</P>
<P>
MedChoice said doctors and dentists must file a copy of their medical 
certificates with the store for doctors or their representatives to buy the 
restricted products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profitable in Oakland 
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers apparently have not been persuaded to join MedChoice. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, needle and syringe maker Becton-Dickinson said it does not sell 
its product to MedChoice and that MedChoice is not authorized by 
Becton-Dickinson to sell its products. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stein, Western-area manager for the manufacturer, said his firm is 
satisfied with its distributor network. But Becton-Dickinson products do appear 
in MedChoice stores at prices far below those of authorized Becton-Dickinson 
dealers. Stein said MedChoice buys his firm's products through a hospital 
supplier, which Becton-Dickinson has no control over. 
</P>
<P>
MedChoice opened its first store in Oakland last June and a second store in San 
Jose in March. Stigge said the Oakland store, which has 6,000 members, already 
has an operating profit and he predicted that the San Jose outlet soon will be 
making money. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to open two more stores in Culver City and the San Fernando 
Valley by fall and expects to lose $2 million to $3 million this year, Stigge 
said. By next year, MedChoice expects to be operating 16 stores, mostly in the 
West. Within five years, the company plans to operate 51 stores across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
MedChoice could face a challenge from MedClub, which opened its first store in 
Mira Mesa in San Diego County in May, 1988. MedClub plans to open three stores 
by year-end in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
But MedClub has not signed lease agreements on the stores, and its first store, 
originally 60,000 square feet, has been scaled back to 40,000 square feet since 
then.

JOINT VENTURE IN MEMORY CHIPS PROPOSED BY 7 U.S. COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a move that dwarfs previous efforts to beat back the Japanese challenge in 
technology, seven leading U.S. electronics firms Wednesday unveiled plans for a 
$1-billion venture aimed at restoring a strong American presence in the 
critical area of computer memory chip production. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed company, U.S. Memories Inc., would be jointly owned by American 
computer and semiconductor companies while operating as an independent 
commercial entity. It is currently described as "a corporation in formation," 
and a final decision whether to go ahead depends on gaining antitrust clearance 
from the government and attracting additional investors. Semiconductor industry 
executives expressed confidence that those requirements will be met, however. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the nation's major electronics companies already are working 
together on research to advance America's technology and competitive position, 
U.S. Memories would be the first major manufacturing or commercial venture of 
its kind. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford L. Kane, a 27-year veteran of International Business Machines, was 
named president and chief executive of U.S. Memories. Wilfred J. Corrigan, 
chairman and chief executive of LSI Logic, is to be its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary business plan is for the new company to manufacture so-called 
DRAMs, or dynamic random-access memories, using a highly advanced design 
licensed from IBM. Production would take place at a new U.S. facility in a 
location yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Kane said building a plant and establishing high-volume DRAM production would 
require about $1 billion. He emphasized that U.S. Memories is intended to be a 
"significant participant" in the global market and a profit-making company. 
</P>
<P>
The seven companies that announced their participation Wednesday -- IBM, 
Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, National 
Semiconductor and LSI Logic -- have put up seed money for U.S. Memories and 
have agreed to take substantial equity stakes in the company, provided that 
additional investors are found. Kane said he expected that the seven firms 
ultimately will own less than half of U.S. Memories, with the balance held by 
as many as 20 other U.S. electronics firms. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for shareholders to be in place by year-end and for plant 
construction to begin next year. Commercial chip production would begin in the 
first half of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Memories would employ at least 2,000 people, according to industry 
analysts, although Kane would not speculate on the number of jobs. He did say, 
however, that he was determined to avoid a politicized site-selection process 
such as the one which took place for the Sematech semiconductor consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Austin, Tex.-based Sematech, a nonprofit consortium working on the 
development of semiconductor manufacturing technology, U.S. Memories will not 
seek government funds. Kane and other officials emphasized that other types of 
government support will be crucial, however. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, U.S. Memories will have to be approved by the antitrust division 
of the Department of Justice, since the member companies are each other's 
customers and competitors. Kane said no formal opinion had yet been sought, but 
added that lawyers hired by U.S. Memories had indicated that anti-trust 
clearance should be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
While the government has approved waivers for some 100 high-technology 
consortiums, those projects have been purely research and development efforts, 
not commercial or manufacturing enterprises along the lines of U.S. Memories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comment From Antitrust 
</P>
<P>
Charles S. Stark, head of the antitrust division's foreign commerce section, 
noted that the anti-trust laws contain nothing to suggest that manufacturing is 
more objectionable than research, from an antitrust standpoint. "There's no 
specific bar to manufacturing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither he nor other Justice Department officials would comment on specifics of 
the group's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Some other observers, including analysts, industry officials and antitrust 
lawyers, noted that the project has the strong backing of the Defense 
Department, which desperately wants to ensure that domestic suppliers can 
satisfy the massive military appetite for chips. 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable sentiment in Congress for joint efforts to catch up with 
Japanese advances in this technology, observers noted. Several pending bills 
would broaden the antitrust exemptions for such projects to allow 
manufacturing, they said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Memories is also counting on continued government help on the trade front. 
"Maintaining strong support in Washington and enhancing the anti-dumping 
measures will be vital," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patriotic Promotion 
</P>
<P>
The company's red, white and blue logo and its name indicate the extent to 
which the venture is being promoted as a patriotic effort. 
</P>
<P>
Trade in semiconductor memory devices is governed by a trade agreement signed 
by the United States and Japan in 1986. That pact resulted in a dramatic 
increase in the price of Japanese memory chips, but failed to produce one 
desired result: a massive re-entry of U.S. companies into the memory chip 
market. Currently, among U.S. companies, only Texas Instruments, Motorola and 
tiny Micron Technology are players in the memory chip market. 
</P>
<P>
At their news conference, officials said the project had the support of all the 
domestic manufacturers of the DRAM memory chips, who stand to become 
competitors in the formidable new enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, however, a spokesman for Micron Technology stopped short of a 
wholesale endorsement of the project. "It certainly shows the need for more 
domestic supply," said Kipp Bedard, noting also that the project's biggest 
backers include some of his company's best customers. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach officials of Japanese DRAM makers were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Importance of DRAMs 
</P>
<P>
DRAMs, while not the most complex of semiconductor products, are considered 
vital because the production techniques used to make them on a mass scale are 
also used for more sophisticated products, such as microprocessors. A shortage 
of DRAMs earlier this year also intensified concern about the U.S. computer 
industry's dependence on Japanese suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"Domestic DRAM production is crucial to U.S. defense and economic interests, 
and is essential to advanced products" such as high-definition television, said 
Gordon Moore, chairman of both Intel Corp. and the Semiconductor Industry Assn. 
The industry trade group has been a crucial forum in the development of the 
consensus that a collective re-entry into the DRAM business was necessary and 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for U.S. Memories emerged from the same process that gave rise to 
Sematech, Kane and others said. Noyce said he expected U.S. Memories to become 
a full member of Sematech and to benefit from the research consortium's 
production advances. 
</P>
<P>
The technology licensing deal with IBM, which must be completed before U.S. 
Memories can move forward, is crucial to the viability of the plan. "By 
licensing IBM's advanced memory design, U.S. Memories will have the jump-start 
it needs to quickly come on line as a serious player," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The IBM design is for 4-megabit DRAMs, each of which can hold 4 million bits of 
information. The chips are expected to be put on the market by Japanese firms 
such as Toshiba and NEC sometime next year, and IBM is already producing them 
for internal use. 
</P>
<P>
Kane indicated that U.S. Memories would remain dependent on IBM for the next 
generation of DRAMs, which will hold 16 million bits of information, but he 
would not speculate on the source of U.S. Memories' technology after that. It 
appears, however, that the company ultimately will develop its own technology.

RESTRAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN; 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMERS SLOWED BY SMALL GAINS IN INCOME

<TEXT>
<P>
American consumers, feeling the pinch of slower income growth, have begun to 
curb spending in a move that could restrain growth in the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the consumer slowdown should be apparent in the May data on 
personal income and consumption, which the Commerce Department will release 
Friday morning, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question about it -- consumer spending has gotten very sluggish," 
said economist Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending habits have been crimped by slow job growth, small income 
gains and accelerating inflation, which has risen at an annual rate of 6.7% in 
the year-to-date after gaining 4.4% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the government reported the smallest monthly gain in 
non-farm payrolls in nearly two years. Increases in wages have also slowed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fuels Debate 
</P>
<P>
Car sales have particularly felt the impact of slower income growth, dropping 
last month from April's pace as Detroit's financing incentives expired. At the 
same time, consumers have sated their appetite for big-ticket items and new 
homes, putting an additional damper on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
On average, economists expect personal income to rise 0.4% in May, the same 
increase as in April. Personal consumption is projected to slow to 0.3% growth 
in May after jumping 1.1% the prior month. 
</P>
<P>
Economists now debate whether the slowdown in consumer spending, which accounts 
for two-thirds of the gross national product, will dampen the growth of 
industrial production and investment. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the strong export boom has more than compensated for slack consumer 
demand, allowing the 6 1/2-year expansion -- the longest U.S. peacetime 
expansion in history -- to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital spending has been pretty solid, exports rose sharply in the first 
quarter, and the April trade figures point to solid export growth in the second 
quarter as well," said economist Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
But other economists believe that the strong dollar, which touched 2 1/2-year 
highs last week, has tempered export growth, weakening the industrial sector 
and leading to the slow growth in new jobs last month. A strong dollar makes 
American goods more expensive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
A mixed appraisal of the health of the manufacturing sector accounts, in part, 
for the wide range of projections on May durable goods orders, which the 
Commerce Department also releases Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Economists expect durable goods orders, which surged an unexpectedly strong 
2.9% in April, to increase more modestly, if at all, in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revision Due Today 
</P>
<P>
Estimates range from a decline of 2% to a 1.5% gain depending upon aircraft 
orders, which are difficult to predict and vary widely each month. 
</P>
<P>
A strong durable goods figure will underscore the economy's strength in 
manufacturing, even though consumer gains continue to dwindle, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the government estimated that GNP, or the value of all goods and 
services produced, grew at a revised 4.3% annual rate during the first quarter. 
The second revision of this estimate is due out this morning, and few 
economists expect any big changes. 
</P>
<P>
Modest consumer spending and income growth in April and May suggest softer GNP 
in the second quarter, but the consumer sector could rebound later this year, 
economists say. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether the latest consumer numbers represent a new trend or 
are a bout of temporary weakness," said Charles Lieberman, economist at 
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. "I suspect the numbers will rebound a bit."

PACBEL FINE TO FUND PROGRAM FOR CONSUMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission granted 32 nonprofit groups nearly 
$5 million Wednesday under a special consumer program financed by a fine levied 
against Pacific Bell for abusive marketing practices in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Created at the suggestion of Public Advocates, a San Francisco public-interest 
law firm, the program is intended to help, among others, people with low 
incomes and those who speak little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell was fined after the commission determined that the company was 
guilty in many cases of persuading low-income and non-English-speaking 
customers to sign up for special services without making it clear that these 
features were optional and cost extra. The services included speed-dialing and 
call-forwarding. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the case, Pacific Bell was forced to make $63 million in refunds 
to 495,000 of its 8.5 million residential customers. In addition, Pacific Bell 
was fined $16.5 million by the PUC. Public Advocates persuaded the PUC to set 
aside that money for consumer education for the groups most hurt by the 
high-pressure marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
The money is to be spent over six years, under the administration of the 
California Community Foundation in Los Angeles. The $5 million granted 
Wednesday was the first allocation of the $16.5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
"This trust fund will create the best-educated low-income, minority, 
non-English-speaking consumers in the country," predicted Robert Gnaizda, 
founding partner of Public Advocates. The largest single grant went to San 
Francisco-based Consumer Advocates to develop educational materials and work 
with other grantees. California/Nevada Community Action Assn. will get 
$669,000, which will develop training programs for the other participating 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups include the Union of Pan Asian Communities and the Chicano 
Federation of San Diego County, which jointly received $535,000 for programs to 
reach speakers of Spanish, Vietnamese, Hmong, Lao and Khmer. A consortium 
headed by Los Angeles' Korean Youth Center will receive $20,000 to develop a 
telephone referral and information network for Korean, Chinese, Japanese and 
Filipino consumers.

PARAMOUNT SAYS ANTITRUST HURDLES HAVE BEEN CLEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Paramount Communications, which launched a hostile $10.7-billion offer for Time 
Inc. two weeks ago, cleared certain federal antitrust agency hurdles Wedneday 
but conceded in court documents that it is not prepared to purchase shares by 
July 5, the date its tender offer for Time is due to expire. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Paramount told a Connecticut judge that Paramount awaits an initial 
decision by the Delaware court where the company has sued to overturn some of 
Time's anti-takeover defenses, including Time's recent move to acquire Warner 
Communications for $14 billion. The next hearing in the Delaware case is set 
for July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's disclosure was made in response to a Connecticut lawsuit filed last 
week by American Television &amp; Communications Corp., a cable TV company 82% 
owned by Time. The cable firm's suit alleges that it would be forced to breach 
some of its financial agreements and franchises with local governments if 
Paramount is allowed to proceed with its tender offer without first obtaining 
the requisite license transfers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confirmed by Paramount 
</P>
<P>
The Paramount admission in court was called to the attention of reporters by 
ATC but subsequently confirmed by Paramount. "We intend to extend our 
expiration date until after the (Delaware) court hearing and a decision," said 
Jerry Sherman, Paramount's vice president of corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman added: "Despite the efforts of Time to stir up opposition with 
misinformation, we expect to get cable franchise approval where required by 
state and local law in an orderly and expeditious way." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Paramount said the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice 
Department's antitrust division notified the company that a 15-day review 
period has ended without the agencies challenging the takeover on antitrust 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price of Time shares rebounded slightly after a three-day 
decline. Time shares gained $4.75 to close at $157.25, while Warner dropped $1 
to close at $58.50. 
</P>
<P>
"People are coming to realize that the game is not over yet," said an analyst, 
suggesting that another offer for Time may emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Paramount is believed to have asked the New York Stock Exchange to 
determine if a Time acquisition of Warner would require a shareholder vote. 
</P>
<P>
An exchange official, without commenting on the Paramount request, said, "As a 
standard procedure, we will review any deal of this nature that involves one of 
our listed companies."

Hilton Retains Shearson: Hilton Hotels, whose stock has soared in recent weeks 
on rumors that it may be sold, said it has hired as financial advisers the New 
York investment banking firms Shearson Lehman Hutton and Eastdil Realty. They 
are to consult on various strategies to "maximize shareholder values," the 
Beverly Hills hotel firm said. Eastdil is 50% owned by Nomura Securities of 
Japan. Shortly after coming into 34% voting control in the firm founded by his 
father, Chairman Barron Hilton said May 12 that the company was not seeking a 
buyer but would consider any purchase offers. Since then, Hilton's stock price 
has risen to above $100 a share from about $65. Eastdil's chairman, Benjamin V. 
Lambert, has been a Hilton director for several years.

New Deal for Sun Microsystems: Sun Microsystems Inc. said it had signed 
licensing agreements with two Taiwanese computer clone makers, strengthening 
its bid to make its computer architecture an industry standard. Datatech 
Enterprises Co. and Tatung Co. will begin next year making low-cost computer 
workstations based on Sun's Sparc microprocessor technology, Sun said. Sun, of 
Mountain View, Calif., hopes that by signing licensing agreements it will be 
able to entice more software developers to write application software for Sparc 
machines, which would make them more attractive to large corporate customers.

USDA DISCOVERS MOTH REPELLENT IN FUNGUS

Government scientists have identified an extract from a soil fungus that 
protects wool clothes from moths and beetles longer than mothballs and doesn't 
leave an odor, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Bry, an entomologist with the department's Agricultural Research Service, 
said the wool protectant could probably be developed as an aerosol spray. 
</P>
<P>
And, while moth balls are usually effective for about a year, fabrics treated 
with the soil fungus extract five years ago continue to repel moths, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
The protectant is derived from avermectin, an anti-parasitic agent produced by 
a soil fungus. 
</P>
<P>
Bry said he has conducted tests on the three worst enemies of wool fabric -- 
the furniture carpet beetle, webbing clothes moth and black carpet beetle -- 
and found that the fungus extract either killed or repelled larvae, even after 
washings and dry cleanings. 
</P>
<P>
Avermectin was developed by Merck &amp; Co of Rahway, N.J., to prevent internal 
parasites in animals.

GNMA NOTES SEIZED AS U.S. CLOSES BANK

Federal agents Wednesday padlocked a small Long Island bank, seized its 
$7-billion portfolio of federally insured mortgages and began investigating its 
officers on suspicion of fraud, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Agents of the FBI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and U.S. Atty. Andrew 
Maloney's office raided the Guardian Bank and its affiliate, New York Guardian 
Mortgage Corp., and told the officers that the bank was being declared 
insolvent, according to Ann Driscoll of the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government is declaring the bank in default under its obligations 
under the Ginnie Mae program," Driscoll said. "We are seizing its mortgage 
portfolio, which is worth at least $7 billion, and the bank records." 
</P>
<P>
Ginnie Mae is the nickname for the Government National Mortgage Assn., a 
federal corporation that underwrites millions of housing mortgages and is 
operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
There were no arrests, but three Guardian officers were informed that they were 
being investigated on suspicion of fraud and misapplication of funds, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The officials were identified as Louis Bernstein, who has a controlling 
interest in Guardian Bank and is president of the mortgage corporation, the 
bank's president, Eddy Milstein, and its senior executive vice president, 
Philip Blumenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
Guardian was Long Island's first black-owned bank and was known as Vanguard 
National Bank until Bernstein took control of it in 1980. Besides the $7 
billion in Ginnie Mae mortgages, the bank holds $1.5 billion in non-government 
mortgages.

PARENTS OF INFANT FIRE VICTIM PLEDGE TO REJECT BITTERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even as they raced toward their baby-sitter's burning home, knowing that the 
odds were 50-50 that their baby girl might be dead, Sue and Don Jordan made a 
tearful pact in the cab of their truck. 
</P>
<P>
They would love each other more than ever. And they would not let bitterness 
ruin their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after their only child was killed in a day-care home unprotected by a 
smoke detector, the newlyweds are keeping that promise. They do not blame Pat 
Orozco, the baby-sitter who suffered burns while rescuing two children and 
trying in vain to save two more. They worry about her. In fact, they still 
think she is "God's gift to children." 
</P>
<P>
In their first lengthy interview since the June 8 tragedy that killed their 
daughter, Jessica, who was 8 months old, the couple talked about their regret 
at not checking for a smoke detector, about their belief that the public's 
new-found awareness "was part of God's plan." And they talked of forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult to take her stuff out of here, and we had to do it 
quickly," said Don Jordan, 24, a silk-screen artist who works for a large 
Anaheim sign company. "I miss her so much. Every day. But we've got to keep 
moving on, looking ahead. Keeping our chin up." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Jordan, 21, added as she leaned into the couch at their modest Huntington 
Beach apartment: "For us, we experienced a loss. But we weren't there to suffer 
the torture of the whole situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a miracle if (Orozco) ever took care of children again, but I hope 
she finds the courage." 
</P>
<P>
Don Jordan grew up in Long Beach, playing the drums for the marching band at 
Wilson High School. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Jordan spent her youth in Diamond Bar. She grew up, however, at age 15. 
That was the year she found herself unmarried and pregnant. When she finally 
told her mother that she was carrying a child, she was six months along. She 
delivered an eight-pound son, whom she named Robert Allen. Through St. Anne's 
Maternity Home in Los Angeles, she put him up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was the best decision I ever made, the most mature," she said. "I 
certainly don't regret it because I gave that child a better life. 
</P>
<P>
"But for me, losing Jessica was doubly hard. Because now I feel I've lost two 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Through a mutual friend, the couple met 20 months ago at a local watering hole. 
They married July 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, they struggled financially to make ends meet. "We used to worry 
if we were going to be able to feed Jessica," Don Jordan said, inhaling on a 
Marlboro Light. 
</P>
<P>
In the few weeks before the fire, he added, "we were just starting to get on 
the right track." 
</P>
<P>
They had gone through several day-care providers, all of them licensed. They 
called a county child care hot line for referrals. "It was real important to 
make sure they were licensed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One baby-sitter seemed hardly to pay attention to their daughter, who quickly 
got her first case of diaper rash. Another sitter had a heart attack and died. 
Still another just cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
After those false starts, they discovered Orozco. The price was right, she had 
terrific references, she lived a mile from them and she clearly loved their 
little girl. 
</P>
<P>
"She treated her like she was her own," Don Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Jordan said: "Pat could tell you what Jessica had done all day, how many 
times she'd drooled, what noises she'd made. You knew she paid a lot of 
attention to her. Jessica came home clean and happy every day. What more could 
you want from a baby-sitter?" 
</P>
<P>
It was barely 10 a.m. that Thursday morning when Paul Thornton, the friend who 
had introduced the Jordans, spotted the smoke at their baby-sitter's Audrey 
Drive home. He could find a phone number only for Don Jordan's mother. He 
called her immediately. He said there was an emergency at the day-care home. 
</P>
<P>
As she spoke to him, Jordan's mother peered out the window of her office a mile 
down the street. She too could see the dark billows. Seconds later, she reached 
her son at work and broke the news. She suspected a fire but said only that 
there was an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Don Jordan called his friend with frantic questions. What was going on? What 
emergency? 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a fire at the baby-sitter's house, and you have to come down 
here!" said Thornton, who lives a few doors down from Orozco. He then told 
Jordan that he had heard that two children had died. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost fainted, then I screamed," Don Jordan recalled. "Then my boss said a 
prayer for us before I left, and he was crying. It was horrible." 
</P>
<P>
He had already called his wife, a receptionist at a mortgage company down the 
street. "You got to get off work now! There's a fire at the baby-sitter's 
house! I'll come pick you up." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Jordan dropped the phone and turned to her boss, saying only that she had 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how to act," she said. "I felt like I was in la-la land, like 
some bad acid trip or something. It was like I was behind some glass wall, and 
everything I said was an echo." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Oh My God! Oh My God!' 
</P>
<P>
As she stood waiting for her husband at the curb, "the butterflies started. 
Then my heart started pounding, and I was saying, 'Oh my God! Oh my God!' 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to to think positive, and (her husband) didn't tell me that two 
children had died until we were on our way. I don't think I ever prayed so much 
to the Man above." 
</P>
<P>
Speeding down the freeway at 80 m.p.h., a sobbing Don Jordan turned to his 
wife. "Whatever happens, I love you, and we have got to stay close." 
</P>
<P>
She nodded, then said, "Don, if she's dead there's nothing we can do to bring 
her back. Being angry at somebody, anybody, won't replace her." 
</P>
<P>
Before pulling up to the Audrey Drive home, Susan Jordan said, they agreed that 
"harboring bad feelings would ruin our life." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, authorities gently told them that Jessica was dead. 
</P>
<P>
As details of the fire emerged, the Jordans learned that one of the four 
children had started the fire with a disposable lighter that ignited an 
upholstered chair. Orozco, who had been in the bathroom, ran out to find smoke 
and flames. She grabbed two children, including Jessica, and ran for the door. 
Her arm was on fire, and she dropped the Jordan baby, then fled outside. 
</P>
<P>
The intensity of the fire prevented her from returning for Jessica and John D. 
Reilly IV, age 13 months. Several heroic bystanders tried unsuccessfully to do 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordans are still in a numb state, and the death of their baby does not 
quite seem real. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like, 'Wow, was she ever really here?' " Don Jordan said. "If the 
pictures and her things weren't still here, it would almost be like a dream. An 
eight-month dream." 
</P>
<P>
A week ago Wednesday, they buried their baby. The Jordans said Orozco's 
children attended the funeral, and Orozco herself tried. Hospitalized with 
burns from the fire, Orozco tried to dress herself to attend the memorial, her 
children told the Jordans. She had to be sedated. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked by them in the funeral procession," Susan Jordan said, "and we 
asked, 'How is your mom?' They said she wished she had died instead of the 
kids. She loved all of them like they were her own." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surviving Children Home 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Orozco was released from the hospital, but she has declined to 
be interviewed. The two children who survived the fire with injuries are both 
home now. The other baby who died has also been buried. 
</P>
<P>
John Reilly's parents are lobbying for tougher standards at day-care homes, and 
the Jordans appeared Monday before the Huntington Beach City Council. Some of 
their wishes were answered when both the Legislature and the city approved 
stricter requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The city now requires all homes, day-care or not, to have a smoke detector. And 
if the governor signs a bill passed by both the Assembly and Senate, smoke 
detectors and fire extinguishers will be mandatory in all the state's day-care 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is too late for Jessica Jordan, her parents are pleased that 
something good has come from their personal tragedy. They hope to have another 
child, but not in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to go on from here," Susan Jordan said. "But it will take us some 
time to get over this."

GANG MEMBER CONVICTED OF MURDERING CHURCH ELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A reputed gang member on Wednesday was convicted of first-degree murder for 
being an accomplice in the slaying of a church elder from Tustin who was shot 
to death in a telephone booth as his wife looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Lavera, 23, also was convicted of being an accomplice in the murder of a 
second man hours after David Thompson, an elder of the Greater Zion Apostolic 
Church in Santa Ana, was slain April 9, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury in Los Angeles deliberated three hours before finding 
Lavera guilty of two counts each of first-degree murder, attempted murder and 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also found Lavera guilty of a special circumstance allegation, murder 
during the commission of a robbery, a charge that normally would qualify him 
for a possible death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors are not seeking a death sentence against Lavera, so he will be 
sentenced Aug. 18 to life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Lavera was a member of the Hoover Crips street gang, according to Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Mark Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Rita Sanders of Greater Zion Apostolic Church said Thompson, who was 30 
at the time he was killed, lived with his family in Tustin and was a young 
elder in the church. 
</P>
<P>
"We were praying that they would get what was coming to them," Sanders said of 
Lavera's conviction. "People can't continue to get away with things like that 
or they will just continue to happen. It was a cruel thing they did." 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the killings, Thompson and his wife were traveling with a group 
from their Santa Ana church. The group was returning from the 50th anniversary 
celebration of the Bethlehem Temple Apostolic Church in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The group's bus had broken down, police said, and Thompson was in a telephone 
booth calling for help when Lavera and two other men pulled up to rob him and 
his wife, Namora, who was sitting in a car nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Namora Thompson told police the men accosted her, robbed her and pushed her out 
of the car. Then they walked up to Thompson and stole money from him, police 
said. Before leaving, one of the two men allegedly walked back to the telephone 
booth, and as Thompson was praying, shot him once in the head, according to 
police.

GOP TREASURER TARGETED; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATIVES LEND SUPPORT TO BUCHANAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flanked by the likes of Robert H. Bork and former Secretary of State Alexander 
M. Haig Jr., conservative stalwart Patrick J. Buchanan stood among the party 
faithful on the damp patio of his suburban Virginia home and reflected on his 
sister's political future. 
</P>
<P>
If Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine is successful next year in her bid to win 
the Republican nomination for treasurer of California, her likely opponent 
would be Kathleen Brown, sister of Edmund G. Brown Jr., California's former 
governor and longtime lightning rod for conservative pique. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan's first fund-raising event in the Washington area emphasized what many 
consider her strongest political assets: the backing of prominent Reagan 
conservatives, and her famous brother, Pat, a magnet for support for 
conservative causes. 
</P>
<P>
"I really hope I could get some time off to go out and debate Jerry Brown," 
Patrick Buchanan, former communications director in the Ronald Reagan White 
House, said with a grin. "I've been working out on the light bag, I've been 
doing some roadwork, and if I have to go up against him, I'll clean his clock." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bork, whose nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court was turned down in 1987 
by the Senate: "Jerry Brown was (once) a student of mine, or I should say he 
was in the classroom where I was trying to teach. . . . If there is anything to 
genetics . . . it is clear I would prefer somebody who shares Pat Buchanan's 
attributes." 
</P>
<P>
But many of the politically savvy among the 250 or so guests, who paid between 
$100 and $1,000 to attend the Buchanan fund-raiser Tuesday night, said the 
event's real target was Thomas Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
A former state auditor general, Hayes officially became a Republican after he 
was appointed state treasurer earlier this year by Republican Gov. George 
Deukmejian. Deukmejian is backing Hayes in the GOP's 1990 primary. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem that you've got now is not the Brown problem, it's the Hayes 
problem," said Lyn Nofziger as he stood under a yellow-and-white canopy, 
dodging the drizzle. Nofziger in the early 1980s served as Reagan's director of 
political affairs. He was convicted last year of violating government ethics 
laws by lobbying his former colleagues within a year of leaving the White 
House. He is appealing the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of Bork, Haig, Nofziger and other conservative Republicans closely 
associated with Reagan "will tell a lot of the old Reagan people out in 
California that indeed (Buchanan) has the support of the conservatives," 
Nofziger said. 
</P>
<P>
"She needs to get that across because Duke (Deukmejian) is apparently 
supporting Hayes so strongly," he added. "I think she's got to point out that 
this guy . . . has never been a Republican until it became politically 
expedient. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Others who were listed as members of the host committee for the fund-raiser 
were former White House Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan, the Rev. Pat Robertson, 
former Atty. Gen. Edwin M. Meese III, and Republican Sens. Strom Thurmond of 
South Carolina, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and Orrin G. Hatch and Jake 
Garn, both of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Buchanan, 40, was Reagan's campaign treasurer in 1980 and 1984. In 1981, 
she was appointed treasurer of the United States, a post she left two years 
later. She has also worked as a party consultant and volunteer nationally and 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the validity of Hayes' party credentials prompted Rep. Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) to withdraw his previously announced support for the 
treasurer and line up behind Buchanan, Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), who was one of the fund-raiser's 
sponsors, is also backing Buchanan. But Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach), who attended the event, said he is still "friendly to all." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he had originally backed Hayes only because he had been assured 
that no other candidates intended to enter the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume, that like a Coast Guard icebreaker, that I've broken some ice here 
and we've parted some of the ice floes, so I expect that a few more 
hard-charging conservatives will join us in the quest" to win the GOP 
nomination for Buchanan, Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
The public display of conservative support Tuesday night was intended, in part, 
to accomplish just that, said candidate Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to raise money. It's tough to get (an issue) that will attract 
people to it who would not otherwise be watching the race," Buchanan said. 
Making a show of the support of prominent Reagan conservatives, and talking up 
a potential match with Brown's sister are two ways to attract attention to the 
campaign, she acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, coming in as an underdog, I have to do that," she said. "Because I'm 
Pat Buchanan's sister and she's Jerry Brown's sister, that gives us the 
national appeal to help with name I.D. . . . and help me raise money." 
</P>
<P>
Before Tuesday's event, the Buchanan campaign had raised about $100,000, 
compared to an estimated $200,000 to $300,000 raised by Hayes, according to 
officials in both campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The fund-raiser at Pat Buchanan's home in McLean, Va., grossed about $30,000, 
said Scott B. Mackenzie, who chaired the event. Buchanan expects to spend as 
much as $2 million on the primary campaign, and perhaps $6 million or $7 
million on the general election, Buchanan's political consultant Roger Stone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes' campaign manager, Brian Lungren, said Wednesday that his organization 
does not "welcome a costly primary," but added: "We are prepared to run an 
aggressive, fact-oriented campaign. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The voters are going to decide on the issues and the quality of both 
candidates. We don't see this race as a statement on conservative versus 
moderate versus liberal." 
</P>
<P>
Steven M. Glazer, media consultant for Kathleen Brown, said of Buchanan's 
candidacy: "She has her hands full with Tom Hayes. . . . We're looking forward 
to debating the issues of California, and the failure of California to invest 
in the future, and would relish that debate with either of the Republican 
candidates."

TONY FINNS FOR HIMSELF IN LANDING AT HELSINKI

Shrugging off a strike by air-traffic controllers, 11-year-old Tony Aliengena 
of San Juan Capistrano flew into Helsinki on Wednesday and got ready to head 
for the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather was beautiful; it was a great flight," said 28-year-old Guy Murrel 
of Costa Mesa, a coordinator of the Friendship Flight designed to make Tony the 
youngest person to pilot a plane around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a three-hour strike by controllers to dramatize their demands for 
better working conditions, the Helsinki airport was closed to commercial 
traffic. But the youngster was allowed to land his Cessna 210 Centurion after 
the hour-and-40-minute flight from Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
Murrel, who flew in the plane with Tony, said the Americans received word of 
the strike shortly before takeoff, and the job action actually began while the 
Cessna was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony had to be just a little more alert and find his way to the airport 
without the help of any controllers," Murrel said. "He basically just had to 
keep in contact (visually) with surrounding aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
Although there were few other planes in the air, Murrel said, three planes were 
waiting at the Helsinki airport to take off after Tony landed. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is also able to get advice every step of the way from his father, Gary, 
39, a certified pilot traveling with his son and supervising his flight, as he 
did last year when Tony became the youngest pilot to fly across the United 
States. Also on the journey are Tony's mother, Susan, and his 9-year-old 
sister, Alaina. 
</P>
<P>
Also accompanying the entourage is Gunter Hagan, 58, a retired physicist from 
Malibu who is serving as an official observer for the National Aeronautic 
Assn., the U.S. sanctioning body for all world and national aviation records. 
It is up to Hagen to verify that Tony remains in sole control of the aircraft 
throughout the 17,500-mile flight. 
</P>
<P>
The trip from Stockholm to Helsinki came after a day off for the 11 people in 
Tony's plane and two accompanying aircraft making the around-the-world flight. 
Tony, his father and the youngster's Russian pen pal, Roman Tcheremnykh, 
enjoyed their day off by heading for the countryside outside Stockholm for a 
day's fishing, Murrel said. The boys caught enough of the small, local lake 
fish for dinner, which was prepared by their hotel chef. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Tony and his entourage plan to fly from Helsinki to Leningrad, the 
city of culture, palaces and lakes that was known as St. Petersburg in the days 
when it was Russia's capital and the home of the czars. Now it is the 
second-largest city in the Soviet Union and a major industrial center. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, Tony lands in Moscow, where the schedule calls for him to deliver 
more than 50,000 letters from U.S. schoolchildren to Soviet youngsters and to 
present Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with a 1,000-foot-long 
"friendship scroll". 
</P>
<P>
"We have come to your country with warm hearts and open arms," reads the scroll 
addressed to Gorbachev and signed by youngsters across the country, including 
Tony's fourth-grade classmates from St. Margaret's School in San Juan 
Capistrano. "With us, we carry our message of friendship," says the scroll. "As 
we kids are the leaders of tomorrow, we can work together for a better world."

COOLER AIR PREVAILS AS HEAT GETS BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The heat wave that was to sizzle instead fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
A weak disturbance in the atmosphere Wednesday enabled cool air blowing from 
the ocean to counter hot Santa Ana winds, which had been expected to pass 
through Orange County from Nevada and Utah, according to meteorologist Rick 
Dittmann of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"The heat wave's not going to happen," Dittmann said of the forecast for 
Wednesday and today, which called for highs in the 100s. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the hottest temperatures were in inland valleys east of Orange County, 
Dittmann said, as the Santa Ana winds failed to push far enough west, saving 
the county from a scorcher on the first day of summer. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature Wednesday in Santa Ana was 86 degrees, at least five 
degrees cooler than in Los Angeles and its eastern suburbs. Even Central and 
Northern California recorded higher marks; San Francisco reached the 90s, 
Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast through the rest of the week and the weekend calls for more of the 
same weather as Wednesday, Dittmann said, with hazy sunshine and highs in the 
mid-80s. 
</P>
<P>
Lower-than-expected temperatures made working conditions a little easier for 
firefighters battling the county's first wildfire of the season, said Orange 
County Fire Department spokesman John Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-moving fire, which blackened 175 acres of rugged grasslands northeast 
of San Clemente Tuesday and early Wednesday, was extinguished by 8 a.m. 
Wednesday, Hamilton said. About 115 firefighters had battled the blaze, and 80 
remained on the scene Wednesday to smother smoldering shrubs and grass, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said firefighters had a difficult time getting to the scene to contain 
the fire. They were stymied by mountains accessible only by steep, twisting 
dirt roads. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very tough terrain to traverse," Hamilton said. "It also burns hot and 
dry. There's always a lot of smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Although dry conditions contributed to the fire, Hamilton said the blaze 
appears suspicious in origin. No damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke was visible miles from the fire, which began about 2:20 p.m. Tuesday 
north of a TRW aerospace facility near Ortega Highway and moved east into a 
nearby canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters needed more than 20 pieces of fire equipment to control the blaze, 
including two air tankers, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
While firefighters had no choice, others took advantage of cool ocean breezes 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Youngman of San Juan Capistrano walked near Capistrano Beach, pushing her 
8-month-old son, William, in a stroller. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too hot for him, so we're heading back inside," Youngman said. "Now, if I 
had a choice, I wouldn't move away. The temperature's quite nice near the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
Construction workers along the San Diego Freeway said they never gave 
Wednesday's temperatures a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just going to get worse. There's no point in worrying about it," worker 
Rich Sallenger said of summer weather, pausing briefly from shoveling gravel. 
"This is what we're paid to do, no matter what the weather." Those who flocked 
to Laguna Beach on the first day of summer didn't seem to care how hot it was, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's 75 or 100, the point is, I'm on a beach in Southern California," 
said a grinning Mitchell Sellers, visiting from Milwaukee. "Everyone else I 
know is working right now. Who wins?"

GAY FESTIVAL ALTERNATIVE FALLS APART; 
</P>
<P>
ORGANIZERS REVERT TO ORIGINAL PLAN FOR SANTA ANA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to move a gay-pride festival and parade out of a Santa Ana residential 
neighborhood and into the city's Civic Center Plaza fell apart Wednesday, and 
the event may now be held at its original site, Centennial Park. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural Pride, charged that the leader 
of a fundamentalist Christian group never wanted the proposed compromise and 
instead pressured City Manager David N. Ream to reverse his decision to allow 
the group to use the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Lou Sheldon, leader of the Anaheim-based California Coalition for 
Traditional Values, denied pressuring Ream but said his group will oppose the 
gay-pride event "right to the end." He contends that efforts and money to 
organize the event are coming from outside the county and said the event is 
"being forced down the throats of residents. Our life and culture are at 
stake." 
</P>
<P>
Ream said that because of Sheldon's continued public opposition, it appeared 
that nothing would be accomplished by moving the event to the civic center. So 
he suggested that gay-pride leaders stick to their initial plan for a two-day 
festival in September in Centennial Park. The schedule includes a film 
festival, historic displays, live entertainment, food and merchandise booths 
and a dance pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Avery said her group has approval to hold the event in Centennial Park and that 
is where it will be held. 
</P>
<P>
"One can only assume that Rev. Sheldon was not seeking solutions to the issues 
he thrust upon the city administration," Avery said. "One could only assume 
that he wants to fan the fires of this controversy for his own personal 
satisfaction and glory." 
</P>
<P>
Avery said Ream notified her Wednesday afternoon that the group should stay 
with the original park site. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the event were first announced in February. Conservative Christian 
leaders and neighborhood residents responded with complaints, contending that 
the gay group should not be allowed to hold the event in a family-oriented 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon opposed allowing the event at Centennial Park because the property sits 
in the middle of a residential area. He said the civic center is an appropriate 
place because it is an enclosed area and children would not be able to view the 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
But when Sheldon learned that the festival includes a gay-pride parade on 
downtown streets, he replied angrily: "I want to tell you this. If they parade 
on the public streets around the plaza, there will be thousands of people there 
protesting." 
</P>
<P>
Months ago, the city's Recreation and Community Services Agency issued approval 
for a gathering at Centennial Park, and Avery said organizers will soon pay the 
required $15,000 in city permit fees. "I will not participate in any more 
negotiations," Avery insisted. "The event will be held at Centennial Park on 
Sept. 9 and 10."

</P>
<P>
You won eight national riding titles in your career and all that time you were 
saving nickels and dimes, not to mention C-notes, T-bills and stock options. 
You are that rare and fortunate individual who is secure in his past and 
future. 
</P>
<P>
So why are you at present sitting in the Los Alamitos Race Course maintenance 
department break room, digging your teeth into a white onion, preparing to put 
up a few more acoustic ceiling tiles in the banquet room? 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Smith, you're a carpenter at Los Alamitos Race Course. The question is 
why? 
</P>
<P>
Why is a guy, so successful that he was known as the Willie Shoemaker of 
quarter-horse racing, still working at the age of 58? Why is a man who had 
numerous seasons of earning $100,000-plus worrying about fitting doors and 
replacing molding and ceiling tiles in the banquet room? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is, Charlie Smith must work. He doesn't need the money, Smith has 
plenty of money. He's one of the founders of the Bank of Westminster, he owns a 
couple of houses, he owns property in his home state of Oklahoma, one parcel 
recently had natural gas discovered on it. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie works because that is what he has done his entire life. From working 
his father's farm in Oklahoma, to delivering groceries from the old man's 
market. He has worked in glass factories, saw mills and ammunition dumps. In 
1959, Smith had to decide whether to ride quarter horses in front of thousands 
of spectators in California or fix cars in downtown Tulsa. This was not an easy 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I had all my tools and I was a pretty good mechanic," he said. "I didn't care 
about being famous or anything, I just want the money. Riding horses was always 
a job to me." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most jockeys who grow up with horses and love horses and can't live 
without riding horses, Charlie Smith grew up with horses and thought horses 
were an OK way to get from point A to point B. 
</P>
<P>
"I rode horses as a kid, but I wasn't big on horses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He first started racing as a young man with a young wife, Doris, living in a 
small town outside McAlester, Okla. Doris and Charlie had each grown up around 
McAlester, grown up during the Depression and Dust Bowl years. They saw farms 
fail and families flee west. Then came the war and rationing. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were very tough, no one gave you anything," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither family went hungry; Doris' owned a farm, Charlie's the market. 
</P>
<P>
"We always had food, but not much else," Doris said. "You try to tell kids 
about what it was like and they just can't understand. I guess nobody can 
unless they live through something like that." 
</P>
<P>
But if you do live through it, you don't forget it. Charlie and Doris live in a 
relatively modest house in Anaheim. Smith makes a point of mentioning that he 
has never owned a Cadillac. It was only recently that the family had two cars 
at one time. Doris with her Chrysler, Charlie with his pickup. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been one to spend," Smith said. "Some of the guys I've ridden with 
spend money like crazy. I could live off what they spent." 
</P>
<P>
When Doris and Charlie were first married, Charlie worked at a local military 
post. Someone had seen him ride a horse, noticed he was a natural at getting 
the most out of an animal, and suggested he ride in the local match races. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie did and won. He'd make $5 for winning a $500 race. By 1957, he decided 
to try his hand at a licensed track in Denver. He won some races, the horse 
would usually win $70 and Charlie would get $7. Things were looking up. 
</P>
<P>
To cut down on costs, Charlie slept in equipment rooms and horse stalls. 
</P>
<P>
"You just find yourself an empty stall and throw yourself down," Smith said. 
"They run me out of the stalls eventually because they were afraid I might 
start a fire." 
</P>
<P>
He also rode in Florida, riding every race he could just to make ends meet. 
Then, in 1959, he came to California to race at Los Alamitos and Bay Meadows 
Park in San Mateo. Doris begged him not to go, she wanted to stay home in 
Oklahoma, but Charlie heard a winning jockey could earn a lot more than a 
mechanic, and that's all he needed to hear. 
</P>
<P>
By 1962, he was earning $100,000 a season. In 13 meets, from the fall of 1961 
to the fall of 1967, he won 11 riding championships at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew how to judge a horse," Smith said. "I could tell if a horse could run 
by the feel of him. And I never believed anyone could run a horse faster than I 
could. It was my business, I knew every horse on the track when I was riding. I 
made sure that if my horse lost, it wouldn't be because of me." 
</P>
<P>
It was 1974 that Smith decided to quit riding. He had always been a bit tall 
for a jockey -- 5-feet-8 -- and was naturally around 145 pounds. Dropping the 
necessary 30 pounds or so started to become harder and harder. He spent hours 
in the "hot box" a torture/sweat device designed to melt portions of a person's 
body. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his last races he rode a horse named Don Guererro to a victory. The 
horse was owned by actor Robert Mitchum, who begged Charlie to delay his 
retirement several weeks so that he could race Don Guererro in the Champion of 
Champions stakes race. 
</P>
<P>
Smith stood by his decision. Bobby Adair took Smith's place and when Don 
Guererro won the race, took home about $50,000. Adair, thankful for the gift, 
gave Charlie Smith a pair of boots. Smith laughs about it now, and he probably 
did then. He has memories but doesn't look back. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he's called to repair something in the Los Alamitos barn area, Smith 
never glances at the horses. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no interest," he said. "That's not my job anymore." 
</P>
<P>
His job now is working as a carpenter. He'll show with great pride the walls he 
has knocked down and those he has created, plus the snack bars, parimutuel 
windows and ramps that are his. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hazard a guess that Charlie Smith knows more about Los Alamitos than 
anyone else, because he built a good part of it," said R.D. Hubbard, who is 
attempting to purchase Los Alamitos from Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are successful in acquiring Los Alamitos, Charlie Smith will be the 
first man I ask to walk through the place with me to see what needs to be 
done," Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith plans to retire in two years. What he'll do at that time, he doesn't 
know. Neither does Doris. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be interesting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has never taken more than a two-week vacation. When he was riding, he 
would finish a meet at one track in the afternoon, have the car and family 
packed and off to another track by that evening. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "I've never had any desire to go to Honolulu or any of 
them places. I'd rather go fishing." 
</P>
<P>
Wherever he is, whatever he's doing, you can bet it won't be on a horse.

BLUE JAYS COMPLETE SWEEP OF ANGELS, 6-1; 
</P>
<P>
TORONTO GOES 14 INNINGS FOR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was so quiet at Anaheim Stadium Wednesday evening that you almost could hear 
the Angels drop. 
</P>
<P>
Until the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Devon White proved that his Gold Glove isn't just costume jewelry. 
It's also when Brian Downing showed that he can aim his home runs toward 
exotic, far-away places, such as right field. 
</P>
<P>
Combine those two things and you understand just how the Angels climbed back 
into a game against the Toronto Blue Jays at the last possible moment -- the 
bottom of the ninth -- only to waste a one-out, bases-loaded opportunity two 
innings later. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 14th inning, the Blue Jays scored five runs to win, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels could thank plenty of people for the extra-inning game, beginning 
with White, then Downing, then Angel starter Bert Blyleven. They even could 
thank Blue Jay Kelly Gruber, whomisplayed Downing's high, arching hit (and 
possible out) into a home run. 
</P>
<P>
But first White. He robbed Tony Fernandez of a sure home run with one out in 
the ninth as he snared the ball as it tried dropping over the center field 
fence. And to add to his defensive show, White grabbed a sinking blooper of 
George Bell's in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Downing did all the heavy swinging. He had a double in the first and 
then that homer in the ninth against reliever David Wells. Gruber, playing only 
his eighth game in right, mistimed his jump and nicked the ball well over the 
wall. The game was tied. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Bert Blyleven deserved better than a no-decision. Then again, so 
did Blue Jay starter Mike Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven needed only 94 pitches to complete his nine innings. He didn't walk a 
Blue Jay, struck out a season-high nine batters and allowed just four hits and 
that one run. It was his second no-decision in his last two starts. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan had reason to wince, too. He left the game with a one-run lead after 
eight strong innings (four hits, one walk), but then saw it disappear on a 
single Wells pitch, Downing swing and Gruber leap (if that's how you describe 
someone staggering backward into the right-field fence). The outing certainly 
will lower Flanagan's earned-run average, but it won't do much for his won-loss 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, here's the kind of a night it was for the Angels: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They begin their half of the first inning with a leadoff double by Brian 
Downing. . . . and strand him there as Johnny Ray, White and Chili Davis fail 
to even move him to third, to say nothing of home. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They begin their half of the second inning with another leadoff hit, this 
time a single by Tony Armas. One out later, Bill Schroeder singles, giving the 
Angels a wonderful little chance to mount a rally against Flanagan. That was 
before Jack Howell, two for his last 12 at the time, grounded into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
After that, scoring chances were few and far between. There was that walk that 
Davis coaxed out of Flanagan in the fourth inning. It amounted to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
There was a one-out single by Howell in the fifth. But Howell, who has yet to 
steal a base this year, tried swiping second and was promptly caught. So the 
streak lives. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Blue Jays did what they had to do against the Angels, which, 
these days, means scoring a single run. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto's lone score came in the fourth, when Fernandez singled to left-center 
with one out. A Gruber double to right moved him to third and a George Bell 
sacrifice fly to center moved him to home and the Blue Jays ahead, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
As has become the June custom, the Angel lineup, from top to bottom, continues 
to struggle. Davis hasn't hit a home run in Anaheim since May 14. Howell is 
three for his last 15. Lance Parrish is two for his last 15. Johnny Ray went 
1-for-5 Wednesday night and his hitting an un-Ray-esque .270-something. Dick 
Schofield is one for his last 14 at-bats. Devon White is in a seven-for-46 
droop. So it's little wonder that the Angel team batting average has dropped 
more than 40 points since May. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel reaction to the deal that sent Rickey Henderson to the AL West-leading 
Oakland Athletics was predictably noncommittal. The A's pitching staff lost two 
relievers, Eric Plunk and Greg Cadaret, and outfielder Luis Polonia to the New 
York Yankees in the deal. "I think it all depends how deep their organizational 
pitching situation is," Manager Doug Rader said of the A's. "If they've got 
people that can step in for Cadaret and Plunk and do the kind of job in middle 
relief that those guys did, then it will be a very good deal for them. But as 
I've said from day Ooe, I think the thing that separates them from a lot of 
others is that they have five or six people in that bullpen who can get you 
through a ballgame." As for the AL West race itself, Rader reserves judgment. 
"I think you have to," he said. "Any time you put a variable (Henderson) into 
what has been a successful program, you don't really know how it will turn out. 
I'm not saying it's going to be good or bad. I'm not saying anything about it. 
I'm just saying that there's a question. Let's face it, they've done awfully 
well with the way things have been." According to Rader, the Angels tried to 
acquire Henderson. "I knew that we were involved," Rader said. "My reaction (to 
the trade) was, 'Well, we don't have him." Angel Vice President Mike Port 
wouldn't elaborate on Rader's comments or confirm that the team had made an 
effort to get Henderson, except to say "that any number of things are 
possible." Like Rader, Port said he wanted the benefit of time to assess the 
trade and its effects on the Angel chances. And despite the recent Angel 
troubles, Port said he was happy with the present roster -- with or without 
Henderson. "There's nothing wrong with this club right now that these people 
can't fix themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Tony Armas, recently recovered from a hamstring injury, returned to 
the Angel starting lineup Wednesday night as the team's right fielder. . . . 
Armas, who missed 30 games because of the injury, said he isn't 100% healthy, 
"but I feel like I can help a little bit, pinch hit, maybe play against left 
handes." Regulars Wally Joyner and Claudell Washington, both left-handed 
hitters, didn't start against left-hander Mike Flanagan.

DOWNING GIVES ANGELS A LIFT WITH HOME RUN, BUT IT ONLY DELAYS DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Ernie Banks used to say "let's play two," he didn't mean all at once. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels and Toronto nearly took the former Chicago Cubs star literally 
Wednesday night at Anaheim Stadium. The Blue Jays finally ended the 3-hour, 56- 
minute game in the 14th inning with a five-run outburst to win, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
And all this happened because Brian Downing smashed his sixth home run of the 
season over the right-field fence off Toronto reliever Dave Wells in the ninth 
to tie the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Downing said his homer "wasn't a total loss." 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking at a shutout," he said. "A lot of people are down on our 
offense and a shutout would have them barking even louder. It put us in a 
position to win it. I would rather have a second life than none at all." 
</P>
<P>
It was Downing's 226th career homer, but only his fourth to right field. The 
last pitch he hit over a right-field wall was thrown by Tommy John on May 14, 
1988, in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But his heroics weren't enough for the Angels to avoid a three-game sweep 
against the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader said several key plays -- Downing's homer, Devon 
White's catch that robbed Tony Fernandez of a home run and the four-hit 
pitching of starter Bert Blyleven -- were overshadowed by Toronto's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert deserved to win and didn't," Rader said. "We had a lot of fine efforts go 
virtually unnoticed because we couldn't get a run." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto cruised through the middle and late innings on the four-hit pitching of 
Mike Flanagan, who was replaced by Wells at the start of the ninth inning. 
Flanagan struck out two, walked one and appeared headed for his fifth victory 
of the year before being lifted. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays grabbed a 1-0 lead in the fourth when Tony Fernandez singled, 
moved to third on a double by Kelly Gruber and scored on George Bell's 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven held the Blue Jays scoreless for the next five innings before 
being replaced by Bryan Harvey in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Entering Wednesday's game, the Angel pitching staff's earned-run average had 
risen above the 3.0 mark (3.01) for the first time since April 25. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Lance Parrish said he's more concerned with the Angels' offense -- or 
lack of it -- than the pitching. They're hitting only .228 for the month. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone seems a little impatient at the plate," he said. "We can't get anyone 
on and we can't get a rally going. It's like everyone is trying to do a little 
too much right now." 
</P>
<P>
So what will it take for the Angels to turn it around? 
</P>
<P>
Parrish thinks the answer will come on Thursday, when the Angels meet AL East 
leader Baltimore in the first of four games. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew what we needed," Parrish said. "Baltimore's playing great, and 
maybe this is the kind of challenge we need right now."

FEDERATED SETTLES LIE-DETECTOR SUIT FOR $12.1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federated Group, a big electronics retailer, has agreed to pay $12.1 million to 
settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of applicants or employees who were forced 
to take lie-detector tests in order to get or keep a job, lawyers for the 
plaintiffs said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action suit, initially brought by four unsuccessful job applicants, 
was brought under a 1963 California law that forbids polygraphs as a condition 
of employment or continued employment and under a state constitutional 
guarantee of the right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, believed to be the largest involving polygraph testing, is 
expected to be shared by as many as 12,000 Californians who worked for or 
applied to Federated Group since 1983. The amount each receives will depend on 
a review of individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers said the case probably will not set a legal precedent because it was 
settled without a verdict. It also will probably not have widespread 
ramifications for lie-detector testing because federal law bans the use of 
polygraphs in private employment situations, except in very specific and narrow 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
However, the settlement does raise the possibility that employees or job 
applicants in California will now challenge as invasions of privacy the 
so-called honesty and psychological tests that employers are increasingly 
turning to in the wake of a federal ban on polygraphs, which went into effect 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
"We think psychological tests are much more intrusive and personal. The only 
difference is that they don't strap you to a machine," said Brad Seligman, an 
Oakland attorney who represented the Federated plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Seligman said his law firm is close to filing a suit that will challenge a 
psychological test used in an employment situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the first major psychological test case in California under the 
constitutional provision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer claimed that employers have "gone too far in their hysteria over 
imagined and real problems." 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to buy security, but they are also degrading their employees," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought Jobs 
</P>
<P>
The Federated suit was filed in November, 1987, by Joanna Mest of Berkeley, 
Scott Vogel of Danville, Cynthia Marques of Santa Clara and Miriam Milgrom of 
Los Angeles. All had sought jobs as sales representatives or cashiers with 
Federated, which is based in City of Commerce and has stores throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four were told that they failed the test, and two refused to answer 
personal questions, Seligman said. Questions included whether they had ever 
received psychological counseling, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement must still be approved by Alameda County Superior Court Judge 
Demetrios Agretelis. Seligman last year won a settlement in a similar 
California case against Fort Worth, Tex.-based Color Tile, which agreed to pay 
$750 to $28,000 each to as many as 3,000 California employees and job 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Seligman said the Federated settlement includes a provision under which the 
company will pay for a toll-free telephone number to help Federated employees 
or applicants participate in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Federated said it ceased polygraph testing after the company was purchased last 
year by Atari, the Sunnyvale-based personal computer and video game company, 
for $67.3 million. Federated also suspended other types of written honesty and 
psychological tests, spokesman Greg Pratt said. He declined to comment on why 
the company chose to settle the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Written Tests 
</P>
<P>
Chances are there will be a number of lawsuits challenging written tests under 
the privacy provision, said William Gould, a Stanford University law professor 
who specializes in labor and employment law. 
</P>
<P>
"The form of the test is not relevant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gould said, the success of such challenges will depend on the specific 
tests challenged and how invasive the questions are. 
</P>
<P>
California courts have given very little guidance on the privacy issue in 
employment cases, said Nancy Abell, who represents employers in labor issues at 
the Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker law firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The case that will most likely give judicial guidance, she said, is a challenge 
to pre-employment drug screening at Matthew Bender, a unit of Los Angeles-based 
Times Mirror Co., which also owns the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Bender applicants won a verdict in that case seeking to halt the drug tests, 
but it was overturned on appeal by Times Mirror. The state Supreme Court is 
considering an appeal by the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this case will be very instructive. The issue will largely turn on 
what is the extent of a job applicant's right of privacy when the applicant 
knows what the conditions of employment are and has a choice of whether to 
apply for the job," Abell said.

WESTERN DIGITAL STOCK PLUNGES 16%

<P>
Western Digital Corp. stock was off sharply Wednesday for the second 
consecutive day in very active trading. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital's shares have tumbled 16% the past two days to their lowest 
level in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Irvine computer products company has made no public 
announcement that would explain the decline. Company officials could not be 
reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the stock closed off 75 cents to $9 per share on the American 
Stock Exchange. It was the fourth most actively traded Amex listing, with 
458,000 shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
The stock has fallen out of favor with some Wall Street analysts since the 
company reported poor third-quarter results. The company has been hurt by 
slowing sales of its main product lines. 
</P>
<P>
For its third quarter ended March 30, Western Digital's earnings plunged 46% to 
$4.4 million, while revenue declined 7% to $243 million. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the company laid off 12% of its worldwide work force -- or 
about 950 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital manufactures a wide variety of components such as 
semiconductors, disk drive controllers and data storage devices that are used 
in the personal computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine firm has been hurt by slowing sales of its disk controllers, which 
have not been included in many of the top-selling PCs made by IBM, Compaq and 
Apple. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Payne, an analyst at the Philadelphia investment firm Butcher &amp; 
Singer Inc., forecast last month that Western Digital's sales and earnings 
would probably tumble for the next several quarters. DAVID OLMOS

The Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency voted unanimously Tuesday night to 
postpone -- for the second time in two months -- a decision on Bowers Museum's 
expansion plans. The proposal, which includes hiring Bissell Architects of 
Newport Beach and Holmes &amp; Narver Inc. of Orange as project manager, is to 
be reconsidered at the agency's July 18 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The museum commissioned a $1-million design from Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer 
Associates of New York two years ago, but decided to scrap it in favor of a 
plan to leave more land on the site for future construction of a privately 
funded office tower. The museum has been essentially closed since January 
pending the expansion, which is expected to cost $12 million.

TROUPE BRINGS OFF 'LITTLE SHOP' WITH BLOODTHIRSTY CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Resident Theatre Company doesn't do anything especially original with 
"Little Shop of Horrors" -- it's all infused with the usual doo-wop pep, and 
the characters -- from nerdy Seymour to sweet, weak Audrey -- are all in place. 
</P>
<P>
But the familiar is performed with colorful confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Director Mary Bettini has brought a spoofy show featuring a lively cast and one 
hungry mother of a house plant -- Audrey II -- to the Muckenthaler Cultural 
Center's outdoor stage in Fullerton. Audrey II bellows just as it is supposed 
to, and everybody else keeps pace with its appetite for misadventure. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Roger Corman's B-movie classic, Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's 
featherweight musical features a goofy score that revolves tightly around the 
film's goofy plot. For those who do not know the story line, Seymour, the 
undervalued nobody of an assistant in Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, finds a 
weird plant during a solar eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that Audrey II -- named after Audrey, the cute but insecure floral 
arranger whom Seymour loves -- is an alien, and a hungry one at that. It digs 
human blood, and Seymour ends up spending all his time searching for bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Like the movie, the musical is outlandish in its lack of good taste, and the 
tunes, while not always memorable, cannot be called tame. Typical of the show's 
flavor, "Dentist!" is an aching tribute to sadistic tooth-pullers, and 
"Suppertime" is Audrey II's demanding anthem to a balanced diet. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC cast, while fairly standard in the characterizations and with voices 
more competent than sensational, nonetheless exploits the musical's giddiness. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Palombo has Audrey's mincing manner and pipsqueak voice down, and she 
brings the right amount of tenderness to her big solo, "Somewhere That's 
Green." 
</P>
<P>
As Seymour, Kenny Rhodes is wimpy, big-hearted and likable. Jerry Siggins' Mr. 
Mushnik, Seymour's boss, is loud and harried. As Orin, the wacky dentist who 
likes to suck laughing gas while making patients weep, Royce Reynolds is 
correctly out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best moments, as usual, are reserved for "Little Shop's" jive, 
street-strutting Greek chorus. The trio -- Rosalind Johnson, Anita Hasten and 
Regina Le Vert -- are just about the sassiest things on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey II is pretty sassy too, in good part to Randolph B. Stripling. He is the 
voice behind this overfed Venus flytrap. Danny Michelson, who moves the, uh, 
head and tendrils, should also get credit. 
</P>
<P>

BUMATAI -- HE'S LIKABLE, ENGAGING AND HAWAIIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The growing glut of comics has given rise to a theory: You need a gimmick to 
stand out in stand-up. Andy Bumatai comes by his most immediately noticeable 
distinction naturally: He's Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that may help people remember Bumatai after the show, but it won't 
necessarily help him elicit laughter from them -- or win them over -- during 
the show. That's where his second most noticeable distinction comes in: He's 
supremely likable. 
</P>
<P>
You see a lot of edgy attitude and misguided (and sometimes contrived) anger in 
the current crop of comics, but it's rare to run into a comedian as 
fundamentally engaging and warm as Bumatai was Tuesday at the Irvine 
Improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
Like any rare commodity, this quality is highly prized and enormously valuable. 
The chief by-product of such an appealing personality is that it quickly puts 
an audience firmly on a performer's side, wanting him to do well, pulling for 
him to be funny -- and staying with him when he isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's show was a classic Exhibit A. Neither well-paced nor tight, Bumatai's 
48-minute set was laced with lulls. It just seemed to be an off night; Bumatai 
would probably concede that he wasn't on top of his game. At the same time, 
thanks to that likability factor, it would be a safe bet that if someone polled 
the crowd afterward, the consensus would be that "we really enjoyed the show. 
We liked him." 
</P>
<P>
A lesser comic might coast on that kind of charm, relying on weak or generic 
material, knowing he could sell it and make it work. Not Bumatai, though. He 
tends to explore different topics, and even when he's addressing more familiar 
ones, he has fresh takes on them. 
</P>
<P>
He's not really a political comedian, but he devoted the opening section to 
some topical stuff, including speculation about the reactions to the Ayatollah 
Khomeini's death ("I got a feeling the Pope is high-fiving at the Vatican") and 
asking, "How many people think Noriega would be less (angry) at the world if he 
had a better complexion? I got a feeling Panamanian mothers tell their kids, 
'Wash your face -- you're looking kinda Noriega.' " 
</P>
<P>
A much larger portion of his act -- in fact, a running theme -- involves a 
bemused examination of the '60s, either on their own or contrasted with the 
late '80s. During a subsection about the changes in fashion and hair styles, 
Bumatai allowed that "one style I'll never understand" is "people who wear 
camouflage pants in the city. What do these people think? That other people are 
going look at them and go, 'My God, I can't see the bottom half of that man.' " 
</P>
<P>
A major subsection that Bumatai developed under the '60s versus '80s theme 
focused on drug use. Kind of interesting how drug humor avoids the typical 
pitfalls of being dated, obvious or just plain dumb when it's skillfully 
filtered through a nostalgic sensibility, or when the behavior and attitudes of 
two distinctly different eras are juxtaposed. 
</P>
<P>
Bumatai recalled that in the '60s, when he and his friends smoked pot, "we used 
to hide from our parents. Now we're smoking pot and hiding from our kids." 
</P>
<P>
Kid: "How come your eyes are all red, Daddy?" 
</P>
<P>
Bumatai: "Uh, Daddy's tired." (pause) "You gonna finish that Snickers bar?" 
</P>
<P>
At another point in the show he asked: "Where are those drug flashbacks they 
promised us in high school? . . . They said: 'If you do drugs, you'll have 
flashbacks when you're older.' That was supposed to scare us, right? All it 
ended up doing was justifying the cost. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Scare the yuppie generation? I think not. We just looked at it like a chemical 
IRA. Yeah, put a little aside every week while you're going to school, and one 
day, you're driving to work -- bang! -- you're at a Vanilla Fudge concert." 
</P>
<P>
He hit plenty of other areas. There was a nice bit about the regional 
differences in speaking habits. He also pointed out some ways your perspective 
changes when you have an infant around the house. "Now whenever I see anyone 
crying, I think, 'Maybe they have gas.' " 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of Tuesday's show, he presented some pieces in which he neatly 
personified animals and objects. In the first of these, he briefly discussed a 
fish sanctuary in Hawaii where "people go to check out fish." He then wondered 
if the reverse is true, raising the possibility of "little fish fathers 
bringing their fish families to check us out," which he then acted out, wryly 
adopting the fishes' point of view. 
</P>
<P>
He extended the marine theme with some comments about a Jacques Cousteau 
special on the mating habits of whales, wondering how the whales might have 
felt about having a camera right there observing. Then he became the whales, 
demonstrating how that kind of intrusion probably killed the mood. 
</P>
<P>
A longer, even more adventurous piece in this vein found Bumatai portraying the 
various items in a refrigerator -- all with different voices and different 
personalities, but unanimously annoyed by people continually opening the door 
and looking in. We'd like to think this one is a work in progress, because it's 
wonderfully creative and different -- but it's not really funny. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it just highlighted the kind of leeway you get when you're as engaging 
as Bumatai: It produced some of the evening's more discernible lulls, yet the 
audience seemed enraptured and supportive. People weren't laughing much, but 
you could almost hear the huge smiles. 
</P>
<P>
Headlining a solid bill that also includes Chuck Martin and Joey Scazzola, 
Bumatai continues at the Improv through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Improv is at 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. Show times: 8:30 p.m Thursday and 
Sunday, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. Friday, 8 and 10:30 Saturday. Tickets: $7-$10.

OCC CAST HAS FUN BRINGING UP DURANG'S ILL-SPIRITED 'BABY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Babies. There seems to be a lot of them on the streets these days, in sparkling 
strollers, cooing with Buddha faces. Young couples are crazy about them, and 
everybody's having more of them. 
</P>
<P>
Some say we are in the midst of a new baby boom. And why not? Babies are super 
-- a perfect addition to the well-rounded twosome looking for that extra 
something. It's only natural. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you're in a Christopher Durang play. 
</P>
<P>
Having a baby is the height of unnatural behavior in "Baby With the Bathwater," 
Durang's 1983 burnt offering to parenthood. This satire -- given a sometimes 
shrill but funny staging by director John Ferzacca at Orange Coast College -- 
is no happy stroll through the maternity ward. It's more like open-heart 
surgery -- without anesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
We first meet Helen and John (against David Scaglione's set of outsize alphabet 
blocks, looking as if they could crash down at any moment) as they peer 
lovingly into the basinet. Oh, what a wonderful baby! What a perfectly 
delicious and wonderful baby! 
</P>
<P>
But soon enough, the doubts seep in. It's a cute baby, but why does it cry so 
much? How do you get it to stop? What is it, anyway, a boy baby or girl baby? 
Does it seem to have a strange look on its face? Does it look insane to you? 
</P>
<P>
John and Helen (effectively spooked performances by Paul Klees and Debbie 
Grattan) begin to dread Baby. Completely confounded (they determine Baby's sex 
only after it reaches its teens), they seek the help of Nanny, a bonkers nurse 
with an S/M streak. Nanny (Marcie Ross) torments Baby with unsafe toys and 
crazed behavior, demands sex from John in the kitchen and crawls into the 
couple's tiny bed with both of them. It's all very Duranged. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to this sick stew is a young woman (Ellen Buckley) who tries to kidnap 
Baby after her own infant is -- steady now -- eaten by a pet dog. The woman, 
however, is run over by a bus while making off with Baby, leaving Baby with an 
ugly memory that turns into a bus obsession by adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, this bus thing is only one of Baby's hang-ups. Finally named 
Daisy by John and Helen, Baby is revealed to be a boy who, until his 20s, wears 
a dress and stumbles through a maze of gender confusion. He has sex a lot too 
-- more than 1,700 partners before he's 30. 
</P>
<P>
"Baby With the Bathwater" may seem like a long journey to make an obvious point 
-- that bringing up baby is no small task and one that shouldn't be undertaken 
by nuts -- but it gains momentum through the sheer spitefulness of Durang's 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Like Jonathan Swift (whose classic anti-social satire, "Gulliver's Travels," 
figures prominently in the play), Durang is a writer with little sympathy for 
humanity. This uncompromisingly nasty focus (at least until the end) leads to a 
few startling truisms. 
</P>
<P>
But "Baby With the Bathwater" does have weaknesses, the most pushy being the 
sweetly buoyant conclusion, in which Daisy (a witty portrayal by Rich Jackson) 
and his girlfriend have their own baby and vow to be good and responsible 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
That's a great message, but it's not necessary to slam it home, especially 
after the point has already been made so obviously. In his 1983 review in The 
Times, Richard Eder economically summed up the ending's troubles: "It seems a 
pity to throw the baby away in the bathos-water." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but up until then, it's an acid bath all the way.

In the United States, more than 10 billion medical tests are performed each 
year. That works out to an average of more than 40 such tests per American 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of life-threatening emergencies, physicians are not allowed 
to order medical tests without your permission. Doctors have a legal obligation 
to explain the potential consequences of refusing to have a recommended test, 
but legally you must first be asked. 
</P>

the frequency with which they should be performed. The less-than-healthy 
individual may need other tests on other schedules.

THE ART OF COCOONING TO SORT THINGS OUT IN A FRAZZLED WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mental health is no longer talked about in hushed whispers. We're allowed to 
become unstrung and to do something about it without being labeled -- at least 
by most people -- as flipped out. That's all to the good. But even better is 
not getting unstrung in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't always batted a thousand on this score, but since I was a small boy 
growing up in a troubled home, I've looked for thinking places -- places I 
could go to sort out the things that were troubling me and return at least 
mildly refreshed in spirit and soul. I believe in such places, and wherever 
I've lived, I've staked them out. Their nature has changed over the years, and 
I have changed, but the need has always been the same. And so has the search. 
</P>
<P>
In the three decades I've lived in Orange County, my places have metamorphosed 
considerably -- mostly because I've discovered that I can be more alone in a 
crowd than when I am physically isolated. That, of course, is a matter of 
personal preference. We should seek out whatever works for us. Here are some of 
the thinking places that work for me in Orange County in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium -- I want rather desperately for the Angels to win, but even 
more, I want them to play. During the six months of the professional baseball 
season, my premier thinking place is available to me. Football season doesn't 
count. The ambiance, rhythm of the game and nature of the football crowd tend 
to stress rather than soothe me. I go to football games to watch football. I go 
to baseball games to probe my soul. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't work unless I go alone. I enjoy going with other people, but not 
when I need to work out something in my head. On most baseball nights, I can 
find a seat in the upper deck where I don't have immediate neighbors, settle in 
with a beer -- and think. I know what is happening on the field; that's part of 
the process. But the pace and nature of baseball, and the environs of Anaheim 
Stadium, give me a greater sense of peace than any other place I know. I've 
worked my way through a lot of thorny problems there. 
</P>
<P>
Any public library -- I know intimately a good many Orange County public 
libraries. They are marvelous places to get priorities in order and to 
understand that whatever is troubling you is not unique. It has been 
experienced -- and written about -- for hundreds of years, and in a library, 
you are in the intimate company of all those authors. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, I browse in the book stacks aimlessly -- and frequently find myself 
pulling down a book with passages that help me. But mostly, I sit at one of the 
tables, a book open in front of me, and think. And something about all those 
books surrounding me puts my problems in better perspective. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose I prefer the UCI library simply because it was so close to me for the 
many years I taught writing courses at UCI -- but also because there are so 
many places in it to get lost. However, almost any library will do quite 
nicely, and I always stop when I'm in my car and troubled and pass a library. 
I've yet to meet one I didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
The beach in the morning and in winter -- We are blessed to live on the edge of 
the Pacific; it is never more than a few minutes away, standing by to open our 
heads with its breadth and depth and suggestion of infinity. But -- unlike the 
ballpark and the library -- people can get in the way of my discourse with the 
sea. So I go there when I don't have to share it. 
</P>
<P>
The best time for me is early in the morning; even during the tourist season, 
the beach is deserted then. And in the winter -- especially when the weather is 
cold and the winds brisk -- I can usually have the Pacific to myself anytime 
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite beach is Corona del Mar. Sometimes I take a lawn chair and sit on 
the bluff and look out to sea; sometimes I walk the breakwater. But always, I 
draw on a sense of the certainty and continuity -- and occasional peevishness 
-- of nature that is healing to me. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner alone -- There is a great difference between aloneness and loneliness. 
When I need to think through a problem, I seek aloneness -- but I'm never 
lonely. And one of the places that works best for me is a small, quiet, 
intimate restaurant. Orange County has dozens of them -- I have my own list 
that I add to regularly -- and the glow of a drink or two and a leisurely meal 
in that environment has become growingly therapeutic to me. It's important that 
I not be hassled or hurried. Loud talking nearby can be difficult, but I've 
learned to block that out. 
</P>
<P>
I used to speculate about people who were eating alone, wondering why and 
mentally projecting some small tragedy of a broken relationship. I don't do 
that anymore. I know that they -- like me -- may be dining alone by choice, 
using a quiet, relaxed meal to help sort out confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Mall wandering -- I find it therapeutic -- even on a moderately crowded day -- 
to drift around a shopping mall full of people bent on appointed tasks with 
whom I have no need to relate at all. I watch them and I read restaurant menus 
and look at old movie titles that have made it to videotape -- and then end up 
in a bookstore. Probably my favorite is Rizzoli in South Coast Plaza where the 
books seem to be treated with more dignity and loving care. Browsing a 
bookstore can settle me down more quickly than any other single activity. Many 
times I've gone into a bookstore distressed and come out refreshed and better 
able to deal with untidy human affairs. 
</P>
<P>
If this seems an odd list, just remember that it is peculiarly mine. If I sound 
antisocial, again I have to do what meets my needs -- and these forays into 
navel-examining don't happen nearly as often as they may sound here. The 
important thing to me is to have places of my own to which to retreat -- and to 
be flexible about changing them when I change. We have a wonderful diversity in 
Orange County from which to choose.

Stress. The very sound of the word makes the heart palpitate, the stomach cramp 
and the jaws clench. It seems everyone knows stress, battles stress and, 
ironically, thrives on stress. "We need some degree of stress in our lives," 
said Anaheim psychiatrist Dorothy Savarirayan. "Otherwise, we wouldn't have any 
motivation." You can't totally eradicate it. So the secret to managing stress 
is not living without it but learning to live with it. Here, then, are some 
pointers for coping with stress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAP AWAY THAT STRESS 
</P>
<P>
On just about every afternoon for the past 10 years, Benjamin Epstein has 
shoehorned a catnap into his busy schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems to get me back on track. It's instant stress relief," said 
Epstein, 37, the vice president of a Newport Beach-based advertising firm. 
</P>
<P>
All he needs, or wants, is 15 minutes of 40 winks. "The process of falling 
asleep seems to be the magic, more than the actual sleep," he said. "You wake 
up to a clean slate." 
</P>
<P>
Epstein has become so attached to his post-lunch ritual that he organizes his 
life around it. "Ever since I first discovered naps, I've always made sure to 
live within 10 minutes of my office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When a business appointment prevents him from breaking for Zs, Epstein suffers. 
"I feel infinitely more tired by 5 p.m.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's only natural our energy level takes an afternoon dip. "The human body is 
predisposed to fall asleep two times during the 24-hour day -- one peak between 
4 and 6 a.m. and another peak between 1 and 3 p.m.," said Merrill Mitler, 
director of research for the Sleep Disorder Center at Scripps Clinic in La 
Jolla. "It's no accident that many Latin cultures have an afternoon siesta. It 
fits very well with the way the body is built." 
</P>
<P>
However, siestas would be unrealistic for most American employees, Mitler said. 
"If a worker says, 'It's my human nature to take a nap right now,' his boss 
might say, 'Well, then, it's my human nature to fire you.' " 
</P>
<P>
While daily naps may be a nice way to calm the nerves, sporadic snoozing can do 
more harm than good, Mitler warned. "Napping that's done intermittently -- one 
or two days a week -- is probably a bad idea. It disturbs the cycle of 
wakefulness and sleep and can make falling asleep at night difficult. When your 
sleep cycle gets out of whack, your stress is increased instead of reduced." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STRESSED OUT OVER WORKING OUT 
</P>
<P>
Usually, exercise is considered an antidote to stress -- not a cause. But 
overexercising can become an additional source of stress rather than a relaxer. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, a lot of the people who are compulsive about athletics are 
compulsive individuals to begin with," said Peter Reynolds, a Huntington 
Beach-based orthopedic surgeon who specializes in sports-related injuries. 
"They go at athletics the same way they go at business and everything else. 
They carry into their exercise the same thought process that got them into 
trouble with stress. 
</P>
<P>
"Exercise should be done as relaxation -- not as another form of competition," 
he said. "You probably shouldn't have a stopwatch out when you're running. You 
shouldn't try to run faster and longer each time." 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Martin Brenner, medical director at Community Psychiatric Center, 
Santa Ana Hospital, said that perfectionism-driven exercisers become agitated 
over unavoidable disturbances in their routine. "If they like to work out for 
one hour, but due to business responsibilities can work out for only 52 
minutes, that creates stress for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, the time pressure people put themselves under is really a strain -- 
trying to do more and more in less and less time. They carefully jam one hour 
in the schedule to go to the health club, change their clothes, do their 
workout, shower, get dressed and go back to work. So instead of relaxing, 
they're compulsively racing through their routine." 
</P>
<P>
Brenner suggests long, brisk -- and silent -- walks to reduce stress. "Don't 
talk. Don't wear headphones. Lose yourself in the exercise," he said. "Boredom 
is what produces stress reduction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHUTTING DOWN A SPEEDING MIND 
</P>
<P>
If you practice meditation in secret for fear your friends will think you're 
weird, come out of hiding: 16% of Orange County residents use meditation or 
yoga to reduce stress, according to The Times Orange County Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Brea cardiologist John Zamarra said he has practiced transcendental meditation 
regularly for 18 years and often recommends it to his patients. "It quiets the 
activity of the mind, and when the mind relaxes, the body relaxes." 
</P>
<P>
The common prescription for transcendental meditation is twice daily, 20 
minutes a stint. TM requires neither chanting nor an unusual posture. "You do 
it sitting in a chair," Zamarra said. "You're not withdrawing, you're not dull; 
you're restfully alert. You've gone beyond thought." 
</P>
<P>
The meditation is not intended as a quick fix for periodic bouts of anxiety, 
Zamarra said. "It's more an overall improvement in the body's resilience to 
handle stressful situations. I liken it to brushing your teeth to prevent 
cavities. You don't start brushing your teeth after you have the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Zamarra believes stress-management techniques, whether through meditation or 
another form of relaxation, are important in today's society. "I tell my 
patients that a practical way to relax -- be it meditation, yoga, exercise, 
reading or counseling -- is essential to a total health program." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Gray Fallat opts for yoga as her stress reducer. "I'm in a high-stress 
profession," said the 46-year-old restaurant manager. "Yoga slows me down 
internally." 
</P>
<P>
Fallat, a Santa Ana resident, started taking yoga classes six years ago. "I was 
losing my wits while managing a restaurant in North Hollywood, partly because I 
was commuting 80 miles a day. My friends were worried about me. One of them 
suggested yoga." 
</P>
<P>
With some reluctance, she gave yoga a try -- and loved it. Her husband soon 
thereafter took her lead. "We never imagined we would be so involved in yoga," 
she laughed. "We didn't think we were the yoga types. Since I've been 
practicing yoga, I feel less stress in general -- less of it seeps in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DON'T DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY 
</P>
<P>
When you're stalled in a traffic jam, the world can look like an awful place to 
be. What are all these jerks doing on your personal freeway? Why didn't you 
move to Fresno years ago? Why did your dumb boss make you drive into Los 
Angeles today? 
</P>
<P>
Calm down. Working yourself into a tizzy isn't going to get you to your 
destination any faster -- nor will it enhance your driving enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"Just say to yourself, 'I'm here, there's nothing I can do about it,' and move 
into an accepting state," said Suzanne Hard, a Laguna Beach-based business 
consultant who presents seminars on stress reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Although the snail's pace of traffic is beyond our control, the tantrum is not, 
Hard said. "We tend to think that the upset is outside of us, that it's 
somebody else's fault. It's that attitude of victimization that gets us hooked 
on thinking, 'This is terrible.' " 
</P>
<P>
She suggested that commuters, first off, quit fiddling with the car radio in 
search of traffic updates. "You already know you're stuck, so do something 
pleasant with your time. I never leave the house without a bag of educational 
tapes. Then if I get stuck in traffic, I say, 'Well, I thought I was going to 
get one hour of listening to tapes; instead I'm going to get two hours.' " 
</P>
<P>
Assume the worst before you even open your car door. "To say you can get to 
L.A. in an hour these days causes stress right away, because most often it 
takes more time than that," Hard said. "Leave early, take your favorite book, 
and if you arrive 30 minutes ahead of schedule, go to a coffee shop and read."

Certain exercises in self-examination can be unsettling -- the kind of zingers 
Dr. Ruth or Barbara Walters ask, the sorts of questions that make you clear 
your throat. Questions about morality, quirks, peccadilloes, scandals, big 
goofs. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, for instance, in the land that glorifies granola and 
fresh fruit and eating to win, the makeup of one's diet could be a source of 
unease. Would you be willing, for example, to fess up to every bite of food you 
had over the course of three days? And write it down for analysis by a 
registered dietitian? Even the Twinkies and the doughnuts and the Maui potato 
chips? 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Edition found four fearless residents, representing 
four different age groups, who were willing to do just that. And, said Santa 
Ana registered dietitian/consulting nutritionist Rebecca Smith, who did the 
analysis, they needn't have worried much. The four are typical of Orange County 
residents in that, for the most part, they eat pretty well. They fit the 
profile of those surveyed in The Times Orange County Poll -- 86% of the 
respondents said they pay either a lot or some attention to diet and nutrition 
-- and their eating patterns are fairly typical for each age and circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to put a lot more importance on their appearance (in Southern 
California)," Smith said. "It's not like the East, where you can put on a big 
overcoat and hide your body. That can be both good and bad. I've seen a lot of 
children who are just on the chubby side, just a few pounds overweight, being 
ridiculed at school, and teen-age girls who are bulimic or anorexic. But we are 
becoming more conscious of what we eat." 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Smith had to say about the eating habits reflected in the four 
volunteers' food diaries, from youngest to oldest: 
</P>
<P>
Erin Kiapos, 12, a sixth-grader at Morningside Elementary School in Garden 
Grove 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she was impressed that Erin, unlike many girls her age, drank a good 
amount of low-fat milk, nearly at every meal. 
</P>
<P>
"Most girls that age don't get good calcium, but hers was more than adequate," 
Smith said. Also, "she did eat breakfast, and a lot of kids that age don't. 
About 75% of the kids I see skip it." 
</P>
<P>
However, like many children and adults, Erin tended to eat high-calorie snack 
foods on the weekends and make up for it early the following week by cutting 
back on total calorie intake. (A better plan, Smith said, is a steady intake of 
food, without bingeing or fasting.) 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, Erin got high marks from Smith, who said that her total 
average caloric intake for the three days was "right on the nose" at around 
1,800 to 1,900, which may be attributable to the place she eats most of her 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
"Because she's 12, she lives at home and she's under the influence of her 
parents," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Erin said she did eat most of her meals at home, and that her mother packed a 
lunch for her to take to school each day. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually eat vegetables and salads and stuff," she said. "Sometimes I'll go 
for the junk food, but I don't eat candy because I have braces." 
</P>
<P>
Her diet differed slightly from the norm over the weekend, because she went to 
an international festival at Old World in Huntington Beach, where international 
foods were served. 
</P>
<P>
The dietitian's recommendations: skim milk rather than low-fat, lower-fat 
cheeses, fewer sodas, lower-fat lunch meats, dried fruits and more grains. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Major, 15, a sophomore at Santa Ana High School 
</P>
<P>
Again, Smith said, the calorie intake over the three days was appropriate for 
Norman's age: about 3,000 calories per day. And vitamin levels were OK, because 
teen-agers tend to take in such a large volume. 
</P>
<P>
However, many of those calories came from foods that Smith said were typical of 
kids that age. "Teen-agers' eating habits tend to be pretty haphazard." 
</P>
<P>
Norman ate too few vegetables and salads (vitamin K levels were low as a 
result), too much protein- and cholesterol-laden food (such as hot dogs and 
pizza) and far too much sodium (also the result of processed or fast food), 
Smith said. Soft drinks also appeared too frequently, and calories from fruit 
came in the form of orange juice (an occasional piece of fruit would have been 
preferable, she said). 
</P>
<P>
The most balanced meal was Norman's Saturday dinner. It included chicken, 
orange juice and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Norman agreed that the Saturday dinner was the best he had during the three 
days. However, he said, with the coming of summer he eats more of his meals at 
home, at more regular times. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of tough to do that during the (school) year," he said. "It's been 
pretty busy lately." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's recommendations: more routine eating habits, especially including a 
balanced breakfast, fewer sodas and lower-fat cheeses, milk and meats. 
</P>
<P>
Art Barrett, 40, owner of a public relations firm in Tustin 
</P>
<P>
Barrett's pattern of eating was typical of a businessman who does a lot of 
eating out: almost no or very little breakfast, a medium-size lunch and a big 
dinner, Smith said. "He does tend to choose the lower-fat foods at restaurants, 
though, and he's a big vegetable eater, which a lot of men are not." 
</P>
<P>
The pattern seemed to indicate his diet was "catch as catch can" when he ate at 
the office, more balanced when he ate out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, she said, similar to Erin Kiapos, "he hit his ideal calorie intake 
(between 2,000 and 2,500 calories, approximately) on Friday and Saturday, and 
on Monday he severely cut back (to about 1,100 calories). A lot of people do 
that: splurge on the weekend and cut back on Monday when everybody goes to the 
gym, and then by Friday they've fizzled out again," eating larger and less 
healthy meals. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett scored well for eating low-cholesterol foods, such as fruits, breads, 
margarine and pastas, but the sodium content of the overall diet was high, the 
result of the amount of salt added to restaurant foods. 
</P>
<P>
"I generally eat more of my foods at home," Barrett said, "and I'll make some 
things ahead of time, like lentil and vegetable soup, that I can eat throughout 
the week. The week I kept the diary I discovered a terrific Italian restaurant, 
though, and I ate three meals there. Generally, I've been making an effort to 
eat regularly and have more healthy food." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's recommendations: a more balanced caloric intake between breakfast, 
lunch and dinner and more balanced non-restaurant meals. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Mann, 79, a resident of Leisure World in Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
She was the most regular as far as her scheduled meals and her eating routine, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Mann's average caloric intake over the three days was low (just under 1,200 
calories), as was her average intake of protein (lower by between 20% and 39% 
than the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for two of the days). But that is not 
untypical for an older person, who tends to be more sedentary than a younger 
one, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
A calcium supplement was noted by Mann in her diary, as was a favorable amount 
of fruits and vegetables and foods low in cholesterol, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"For a 79-year-old woman, it's a good diet," she said."I'm impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Mann said her lower caloric intake during the three days was influenced in part 
by the fact that she had a plumbing emergency at her home "and worrying about 
that kind of took away my appetite. Usually I would have eaten more. I have a 
huge appetite, I really do." 
</P>
<P>
She also said her eating habits can be erratic, but she remains active, walking 
frequently and participating in folk dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's recommendations: more protein sources, such as cheese and meats, yogurt 
and dried beans, as well as milk products.

<P>
On an impulse once, Dr. Rick Ulene joined a health club. He toured the place, 
put down $400 and returned to work out twice. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't for lack of motivation or lack of interest in his health. Ulene, then 
in medical school, simply didn't have the time in his schedule to include a 
trip to the club. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, in the extra-large bedroom of his Newport Beach home, he set 
up a $5,000 home gym complete with a Lifecycle and free weights. 
</P>
<P>
"My health became a priority for me again," he said. "But I want to stay home. 
I don't want to have to leave the house to get healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Ulene, who was inspired to buy his home gym after attending a weeklong fitness 
camp last year, is typical of an increasing number of Orange County residents 
concerned about keeping their bodies firm and their hearts healthy but who 
aren't interested in fighting the crowds or the intimidation that sometimes go 
with the health club scene. 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers estimate that the top 10 manufacturers of home gym equipment 
had sales last year of $620 million, up more than 20% from 1987 when the group 
sold $505 million in equipment, and 45% above the sales for 1986, according to 
an industry study by Find/SVP, a New York research firm. 
</P>
<P>
A big reason for the surge in popularity is the kind of equipment available for 
home use. No longer are health clubs the only ones that can afford quality 
equipment. And no longer do home setups consist of a simple stationary bicycle 
and a few barbells. 
</P>
<P>
These days, a home gym can include electronic, simulated stair climb on a Stair 
Master, a bicycle that describes in digital displays everything from your heart 
beat to the number of calories you're burning, and computerized weight machines 
that talk to you. 
</P>
<P>
Products like the Lifecycle, made by Life Fitness in Irvine, have helped 
revolutionize the at-home gym the way microwave ovens have changed home 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Life Fitness, which introduced its popular Lifecycle to health clubs in the 
late 1970s, created a home model in 1983 and sold 2,500 units that year. The 
company reported that last year it sold 30,000 home units at $1,595 each. 
Health experts said that advanced, stationary bikes like the Lifecycle have 
become the staple of a home gym because they offer the cardiovascular benefits 
of aerobics, they're easy to use for the under-conditioned exerciser and you 
can watch television or read a book while riding. 
</P>
<P>
John Parker, a commercial developer in Newport Beach, is among those who 
started assembling a home gym after being taken by the new high-tech generation 
of equipment, as well as the contagious desire to stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Parker and his wife, Betty, started their gym by buying a Lifecycle. 
Each rides 30 minutes per sitting -- John four days a week, Betty five. 
</P>
<P>
Parker typifies the health enthusiast who has expanded his home exercise 
regimen but hasn't given up going to the health club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of choice. I really couldn't get along without both," said 
Parker, who still goes to the health club four mornings a week for a swim. 
</P>
<P>
Although home gyms are increasing in popularity, they still are not commonplace 
-- the Find study reported that fewer than 3% of Americans have them. 
</P>
<P>
Exercise experts say a lot of people skip exercise out of laziness or because 
they find it boring. Among those willing to make time for exercise are older 
Americans. People over 55 are the biggest growth market for home gym purchases, 
while those under 35 are the most likely group to flock to health clubs, 
retailers and manufacturers said. 
</P>
<P>
Health clubs, which had a 12% boost in membership across the country last year, 
are attractive because they offer what most home gyms can't -- hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in equipment and lots of opportunity for social and 
business contacts. And the biggest plus to many is the highly charged, 
motivational atmosphere of a health club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to not get motivated at a health club. At home it's easy to do 
something else if you don't keep focused on exercise," said Michael Hoffman, a 
spokesman for Life Fitness. 
</P>
<P>
Still, health clubs in Orange County and elsewhere are keenly aware of the 
competition from home gyms, and their marketing efforts are designed to 
complement it rather than fight it. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, at Holiday Spa Health Clubs, members can buy a Lifecycle as well 
as the latest high-protein drink. 
</P>
<P>
In a study of a group of Holiday members, half of whom bought Lifecycles from 
the club, 96% of the bike buyers remained members several months later, while 
76% of the non-buyers kept their memberships, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members at the chic, $25-million Sporting Club that Sporting Clubs of 
America will open in Irvine next year will go off-site to conduct aerobics 
programs for exercisers who might not be willing to join a club. 
</P>
<P>
"The more someone exercises at home, the more that person will be interested in 
wanting a full-service health club program like we offer," said Daniel Lynch, 
an executive of San Diego-based Sporting Clubs, which operates six executive 
health clubs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Health clubs also are facing a new competitive challenge from corporations, 
which, to reduce health insurance costs and meet workers' rising expectation of 
health benefits, are offering an increasing amount of health and exercise 
benefits and services. 
</P>
<P>
"The shift has meant building a health club where people work, not where they 
live," said Michael Talla, president of Sports Connection, which is developing 
Sports Club/Irvine, a $20-million club set to open late this year in the Irvine 
Spectrum office development. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Talla said, the club has signed up 2,000 members, about half of whom 
are part of corporate membership programs paid for or subsidized by employers. 
The club will offer executive dining rooms to bring corporate leaders out of 
their executive suites and child-care services to get parents out of the home. 
</P>
<P>
Rival Sporting Clubs, which has signed up 1,500 members so far, recently began 
taking its services to employers, offering cholesterol and fat tests and health 
counseling programs at the corporate site, and staff members set up exercise 
strategies for workers that may include home exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Executive memberships will be in excess of $100 a month per person at Sports 
Club/Irvine and the Sporting Club, compared to $19 monthly dues often 
advertised by Holiday and $50 per month at many other full-service clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Gaudio thinks he's come up with a compromise between the health club and a 
home gym. Lou Gaudio's Studio in Dana Point has about 60 clients who have the 
equipment and motivational advantages of a health club, but greater privacy in 
an intimate setting and personal training from Gaudio and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Gaudio, a former ad salesman who got hooked on fitness and became a personal 
trainer six years ago, opened his studio last year. His client list, which he 
hopes to limit to 80, includes well-heeled professionals willing to pay $300 a 
month for personal training. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my members have home gyms," Gaudio said. "They come here for their 
motivation."

ASK THE VET: VACATIONERS NEED TO PLAN FOR THEIR PETS TOO

Q In the middle of July, my wife and I are planning a three-week trip through 
the Western United States, including Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. We are 
planning on taking our two cockapoos, Mindy and Zero, with us, and they will be 
traveling in the trailer home. What precautions should we take for the dogs? Do 
we need any special papers or permits? They have made several small trips 
locally without any problems. Where can we get any information on campgrounds 
that accept pets? 
</P>
<P>
Peter Munson, Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: If you are planning long trips with your pets, you should always make sure 
that you have their vaccinations -- especially rabies -- current, and keep a 
copy of the certificates handy. If your pets are taking any medication or are 
on special diets, be sure that you have plenty of both to cover the time that 
you will be gone. It may be very difficult to get medications refilled without 
having your pets examined again. If you know that you will be traveling through 
a heart worm endemic area, it may be wise to start your dogs on preventive 
medication to keep them from becoming infected. Your veterinarian will be able 
to help you decide if this will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Since you will be traveling in July, avoid exposing the dogs to excessive heat 
and supply plenty of fresh water. It may be necessary to rest during the 
hottest parts of the day to avoid heat-related problems. You may have to feed 
them early in the morning or later in the evenings after things have settled 
for the day. If you are going to be out visiting sights when the weather is 
particularly hot, you might look into boarding your pets for the day at a local 
pet hotel where they will be cool and comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
The Automobile Club or KOA may be able to supply you with lists of campgrounds 
that accept (or bar) pets. Most campgrounds require that the dogs be leashed 
for their own safety and kept inside at night to avoid confrontations with 
local wildlife. It would be a good idea to keep some flea spray or dip handy to 
control fleas or ticks that may be encountered. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a very active 8-month-old Keeshond named Sara that occasionally acts 
very nervous around strangers or strange noises. Do you think I will need to 
get her some tranquilizers for the Fourth of July? She's never been around any 
type of fireworks, and I'm afraid that she might freak out. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Seimons, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A: You need to talk to your veterinarian and see what he or she thinks about 
Sara. If you think that she might need sedatives, your vet may want to examine 
her and prescribe a medication to calm her. Since it will probably be tablets, 
you should allow one-half to a full hour for the medication to take effect. It 
may be wise to keep Sara indoors, where the sounds will be muted and she will 
be less likely to run off.

NO SWEAT, INDEED

<TEXT>
<P>
Not all that long ago, my husband and I moved here from Mexico City, the 
world's biggest and probably most polluted metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico City is a place that doesn't know from catalytic converters, a place 
where I watched birds drop dead from the sky and a place whose essence I 
inhaled for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians and other medical experts in Mexico City are concerned about the 
health effects of all this pollution, so they advise the general population to 
avoid doing anything foolhardy, such as jogging. Seems that the harder one 
breathes, the deeper go the pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City I was comforted to know that by partaking of such activities as 
reading or watching TV -- as long as no heavy breathing was involved -- I was 
working to stave off physical deterioration and disease. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when I came to Orange County, I felt in great shape. I had spent the 
last three years faithfully engaging in mild exercise (indoors and with the 
drapes drawn), and I am not a smoker (though the air in Mexico City supplies 
residents with all the tar and nicotine any body can possibly need). 
</P>
<P>
So I guess that's why I was initially taken aback with the notion, so big in 
Orange County, of outdoor recreation. All of a sudden, I realized that the 
fitness life style that had suited me so well was under attack. And the assault 
came from all quarters. 
</P>
<P>
I noticed that when real estate agents start buttering up potential buyers in 
Orange County, they hit them with the outdoor recreation angle right away. 
</P>
<P>
Brochures are full of phrases such as "ideal climate year round" and 
"sportsman's paradise." Planned communities have planned lakes; in a shameless 
bow to snob appeal, memberships are usually required. 
</P>
<P>
Home prices are closely related to distance from a beach (possible terrain for 
early morning jogs and volleyball games) or, failing that, proximity to 
mountains (possible terrain for hiking or RVing). 
</P>
<P>
And anybody who's anybody in the county has a pool and a spa, a word I formerly 
connected with overweight Europeans being wrapped in hot towels. Now I realize 
that spa is the '80s way of saying Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not being one to stick out, I endeavored to give recreating Orange 
County-style a try. It started with rather large expenditures of money. 
</P>
<P>
Because my husband and I bought a home in a planned community, we found 
ourselves conveniently near several planned recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
We joined the recreation center for a sum larger than the annual cost of 
feeding a needy child in the Third World, and we joined the lake association 
for a monthly fee that will be attached to our house in perpetuity. I'll have 
you know that in Mexico, not even graves last that long. 
</P>
<P>
Then we started buying equipment. At various times in our former lives, both my 
husband and I played tennis, so we dismissed that. 
</P>
<P>
Volleyball was much too organized, I'm too short to go one on one with my 
husband on the basketball court and golf is too hideous to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
Racquetball it was. We bought neat new racquets, his and hers, balls and shoes. 
It was a good excuse to buy new shorts, a few T-shirts, and then, what the 
heck, I picked up some leather gloves too. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon, my husband came home and told me that he had ordered some 
specially designed prescription glasses for wearing on the court, so I knew we 
were getting serious. 
</P>
<P>
Then we went to play. We swung at the ball and hit it off the wall. We made up 
a couple of rules. We even decided to take a lesson, which we did. 
</P>
<P>
And that was it. We never went back. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, sure, we kept paying for our membership to the rec center, and of course, 
the in perpetuity stuff has us locked into the lake association for quite a 
while. But somehow, after all the fun of buying equipment, sweating inside a 
windowless cell seemed a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
So we tried the bicycles. No, we did not go out and buy new bicycles. We spent 
the same amount of money that new bicycles would have cost and had our old ones 
tuned up. That did include new handlebar tape. 
</P>
<P>
The bicycle shop did a rush job for us. It was a nice day out, and the shop 
owner must have suspected that we wanted to catch up on our outdoor recreating 
right away. 
</P>
<P>
My husband even rode his bicycle home from the shop, while I carted mine home 
in the car that we drove to the store. Then in a show of solidarity with my 
husband for his solo ride home, I accompanied him on a bike ride down our 
street. 
</P>
<P>
That was about a year ago. My bicycle has not left the garage since. 
</P>
<P>
But lately, while climbing in and out of my car, I have noticed that the days 
seem to be getting a little warmer. And that could mean that some outdoor 
recreation is in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
So you see, after a little more than a year in Orange County, I have already 
fully adapted to the prevailing fitness life style. 
</P>
<P>
Spending money is great recreation.

BODYBUILDER LIFTS HERSELF TO THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sue Gafner didn't pick up her first barbell until January, 1987, but by April 
of that year she was already flexing her pecs on stage and winning the overall 
women's title at the annual Palm Springs Muscle Classic novice contest. 
</P>
<P>
Her speedy rise to the top ranks of women's amateur bodybuilding continued last 
year when she won the lightweight title at the U.S. Bodybuilding Championships 
in Las Vegas, one of the most prestigious contests in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"For her to begin competing in '87 and then win the USA in '88 . . . Oh yes, 
that's very fast," said Jim Manion, president of the Pennsylvania-based 
National Physique Committee, the organization that sanctions amateur 
bodybuilding contests in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for someone who, by her own admission, is a former "mega-couch potato" 
who started lifting weights as part of a New Year's resolution to lose a few 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the kind of person who would go to the gym real sporadically," said 
Gafner, a 26-year-old Tustin resident who hangs wallpaper for a living. She had 
taken aerobics classes but never got the results she wanted, so she bought a 
book by a female bodybuilder and decided to give weight training a try. 
</P>
<P>
"My body just responded really quickly," Gafner said. Friends at the Placentia 
gym where she works out noticed her suddenly lean build and well-defined 
muscles and suggested that she give amateur competitive bodybuilding a shot. 
</P>
<P>
She had never considered competing before, but when she took the stage in Palm 
Springs that first time she knew she was hooked. "It's just something that you 
kind of fall in love with," Gafner said. "I knew I wanted to keep going with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Gafner, who is married, said her family and friends were skeptical at first 
about her new-found avocation but have long since come around. "They're real 
supportive," she said. "They follow me everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband of 6 1/2 years was an avid weight trainer before Gafner started 
bodybuilding, and has only gotten more involved since. "He loves it because I'm 
happy with myself," Gafner said. 
</P>
<P>
At 5 feet, 2 inches and about 110 pounds, Gafner is lean and muscular but not 
the Amazon that some might expect from the stereotype of a female bodybuilder. 
</P>
<P>
Before she started bodybuilding, Gafner would look at the models in fashion 
magazines and feel envy. Now she sees the same pictures and finds the women 
shapeless. "Your whole concept of what looks good changes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some women on the female bodybuilding circuit are too massive for 
Gafner's taste. While she strives to add more muscle density to her own frame, 
there is a limit to how much bulk she wants, no matter what the pressures of 
winning contests. "I have to be happy with myself," she said. "I have to live 
with my body for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Gafner admits that she was a "total greenhorn" when she started her training 
and attributes her success to hard work, a diet change that almost completely 
eliminated fats and sugars and "God-given genetic ability." 
</P>
<P>
There was a point early on when she hit a plateau, unable to add more muscle 
mass. That's when she met an experienced bodybuilder, Lisa Hitchens, who helped 
her adjust her routine. "She saw the potential in me," Gafner said. "She kind 
of set me straight as far as training." 
</P>
<P>
She has not competed since winning her division at the U.S. Bodybuilding 
Championships last year, taking the time off to concentrate on training for the 
sport's top U.S. event, the 1989 Women's Nationals to be held in New York in 
September. If she does well, that could lead to the World Amateur Championships 
and even to professional status. 
</P>
<P>
Gafner now spends about 60 to 75 minutes a day in the gym, with one day off 
following every three days of training. She does high-speed, high-intensity 
workouts, concentrating on a different area of the body each workout day. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Gafner has to work hard to add muscle to her frame. It is a problem most 
women bodybuilders have, a problem many seek to overcome with the help of 
steroids. At last year's U.S. Bodybuilding Championships, one of the first 
shows that employed drug testing, two leading contenders in Gafner's division 
tested positive and were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"Most athletes have a pressure to do drugs, particularly bodybuilders and 
especially women bodybuilders," Gafner said. "I've always felt that taking 
drugs was wrong." Steroid users "have to live with the effects for the rest of 
their lives," Gafner said. "I know I won because I worked hard."

Police were searching for a drive-by gunman who wounded four people, three of 
them juveniles, in an attack Wednesday night in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, Carlos F. Gutierrez, 21, and three boys, ages 13, 14 and 15, were 
taken to area hospitals. Some of the victims were wounded several times, but 
all are expected to survive. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred just minutes apart, when a passenger in a blue car 
wounded two boys who were riding on a single bicycle in the 2300 block of West 
Monta Vista Avenue, according to Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. 
The car turned onto the 600 block of South Townsend Street, where a third boy 
was struck by bullets while standing in a driveway and Gutierrez was shot in 
the face as he stood in his yard. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have not yet determined whether the shootings, which occurred 
about 8:45 p.m., were random, Thomas said. At least two people are believed to 
have been in the car.

Former Gov. Daniel Walker, who pleaded guilty to taking $1.45 million in 
fraudulent loans, was free today on a federal judge's order reducing his 
sentence to the nearly 18 months he served in a federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, 66, whose fraudulent deals included one with his own savings and loan 
association, was freed Wednesday from the federal prison camp in Duluth, Minn., 
hours after his lawyer filed a motion seeking early release. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a Democrat, had served nearly 18 months after pleading guilty to fraud 
charges on Oct. 9, 1987. He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for bank 
fraud, perjury and misapplication of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was a longtime adversary of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley and first 
attracted national attention when he compiled a report on the violence at the 
1968 Democratic National Convention, infuriating Daley by calling the clash a 
"police riot."

BE 'POINTS OF LIGHT,' BUSH URGES PUBLIC;

PRESIDENT OUTLINES VOLUNTEER PROGRAM TO FIGHT SOCIAL ILLS

<P>
President Bush proposed a $100-million national volunteer program today, urging 
all Americans to become "points of light" by helping their communities fight 
homelessness, hunger, drug abuse and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to New York civic leaders, Bush officially outlined his four-year 
program "to join hands and link hearts, to light up the American sky." Led by 
New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean, it will encourage citizens of all ages as well 
as businesses and other institutions to work harder against social ills. 
</P>
<P>
"Today I ask all Americans . . . to make service central to your life and 
work," the President told about 1,200 members of the civic organizations called 
New York Partnership and Assn. for a Better New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here today to ask that all sectors private and public . . . join this 
great movement to extend national service into every corner of America," he 
said. "For it is a movement, bold and unprecedented -- not a program, not 
another bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
Bush is asking Congress for $25 million annually for four years to endow the 
Youth Engaged in Service to America program, dubbed YES, through a foundation 
that would seek another $25 million a year in matching private funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Phrase 
</P>
<P>
"We call this catalyst the 'points of light' initiative," Bush said, reviving 
the campaign phrase he used to describe volunteers. "(It is) a foundation of 
which I will serve as honorary chairman and that will help make our movement a 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, overseen more directly by Kean and a national board of 
directors, would seek to give training and technical assistance to programs 
based on successful volunteer models nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has often made a point of his own volunteer service, ranging from 
sponsorship of a Little League baseball team to involvement with the United 
Negro College Fund to donations of old clothes to charities.

The wife of Japanese Prime Minister Sosuke Uno apologized for the clamor caused 
by reports her husband had paid a geisha $20,000 to have an affair with him, 
but said in an interview published today that she believed he was faithful. 
</P>
<P>
Chiyo Uno told the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun she did not know the details 
about the alleged relationship between her husband and the unidentified geisha. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I believe that nothing of the sort happened," she said, adding that 
early in their marriage Uno had promised to be faithful. 
</P>
<P>
"At any rate, it's all in the past, so why should it be made an issue of now," 
Mrs. Uno said. "But I would not forgive him if he were to break his promise by 
fooling around with geishas." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese women's groups have expressed outrage over the scandal and have called 
on Uno to resign.

REPORT ON ECONOMY SENDS MIXED SIGNALS; 
</P>
<P>
4.4% GNP RISE TIED TO BOOKKEEPING, NOT REAL GROWTH

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. economy appeared to grow at an annual rate of 4.4% in the first three 
months of the year, slightly better than previously believed, but actually 
slowed dramatically, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said more than half the growth in the gross national 
product came from a rebound from last summer's drought, a one-time boost that 
is more of a reflection of the government's accounting methods than a 
measurement of the real economy. 
</P>
<P>
Discounting the bookkeeping entry to return expected farm production this year 
to its pre-drought levels, growth actually slowed dramatically in the 
January-March quarter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sluggish Non-Farm Growth 
</P>
<P>
The non-farm economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 1.9%, contrasted with a 
3.5% rate in the final three months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
This slowdown is in line with many economists' expectations. Private analysts 
predict that the U.S. economy will slow dramatically this year under the impact 
of an anti-inflation campaign waged by the Federal Reserve. The central bank in 
March, 1988, began to drive interest rates higher in an effort to dampen 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
The new GNP report contained some good news on the inflation front as a GNP 
price index rose at an annual rate of 4.6%, down from a preliminary estimate of 
5% a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the GNP price index that measures a fixed market basket of 
goods was up only slightly from a 4.2% increase in the fourth quarter of 1988. 
The government said the downward revision came from slower price increases for 
farm products and industrial supplies than earlier estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts are predicting that overall growth will slow this year to what is 
known as a growth recession, a period when the economy keeps expanding but at 
such a sluggish pace that unemployment rises. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe that is already occurring. After falling to a 15-year 
low in March, the unemployment rate has risen to 5.2%, with job growth dropping 
in May to its slowest pace in three years. 
</P>
<P>
While the expectation of slower growth this year is virtually universal, there 
is still a hot debate over whether the slowdown will worsen into a recession, 
ending the record six-year peacetime economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Rates Lowered 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve sent signals last week that it has begun lowering interest 
rates slightly. Optimists are hoping that move will occur in time to revive 
important sectors of the economy, such as housing and auto sales, that have 
been hurt by rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the economic slowdown was evident in a companion report released 
today that showed the after-tax profits of American corporations fell by 1.1% 
in the first three months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first setback for corporate profits since a 2.5% decline in the 
first quarter of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The primary reason for the slight upward revision in the overall 4.4% GNP 
figure was a better performance in trade than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, as measured by the GNP, narrowed by $19.5 billion in 
the first quarter as exports shot up by 15% and imports fell by 0.5%. It was 
the first quarterly trade improvement since the spring of 1988.

Rival British and U.S. bidders today raised the stakes in the takeover fight 
for Gateway Corp. PLC, Britain's third-biggest supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
British investor group Isosceles PLC lifted its hostile bid for Gateway by 31 
cents to $3.60 a share, valuing the company at $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But rival bidder Newgateway, which includes U.S. investment banker Wasserstein 
Perella &amp; Co., struck back within hours, raising its own friendly offer to 
$3.67 a share from the $3.51 it offered earlier. The new offer is worth about 
$3.26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Isosceles, which includes former Gateway managers, also disclosed today that it 
has bought a key 15.1% stake in Gateway from another British food group, 
bringing its stake in the food retailer to 41.9%. Newgateway said Wednesday 
that it holds just 0.56%.

PERMANENT BAN ON AIRLINER SMOKING URGED 
</P>

Anti-smoking activists, medical experts and several members of Congress called 
today for a permanent ban of smoking on airliners. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, including tobacco interests and some lawmakers, urged that Congress 
await the results of a government study before making permanent or expanding 
the current law that bans smoking on short flights. 
</P>
<P>
The differing views came in testimony submitted at a congressional hearing that 
included a plea from a flight attendant who said her health was ruined from 
serving smoking passengers and an indoor air expert who said there are worse 
health hazards -- including infectious disease -- in an airliner cabin than 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Isn't It Time . . . ?' 
</P>
<P>
"Only a total ban on airline smoking will adequately protect the health and 
safety of airline passengers and flight crews," said Rep. Richard J. Durbin 
(D-Ill.), who is sponsoring legislation that would give Congress a choice of 
making the ban on flights under two hours permanent or expanding it to a 
permanent ban on smoking aboard all commercial flights. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it time all our domestic flights were smokeless?" asked Rep. Robert G. 
Torricelli (D-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Robert Lindsay Thomas (R-Ga.) and Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), however, told the 
House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on aviation not to pass any 
anti-smoking bill until the Department of Transportation completes a study of 
air quality aboard airliners. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we will find a solution to this problem which will protect the rights 
of both those who choose to smoke and those who have decided not to do so," 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the American Medical Assn., the American Assn. for 
Respiratory Care and the Assn. of Flight Attendants called for a permanent ban 
of smoking on all flights, saying smoking poses a proven health hazard to 
nonsmoking passengers and crew as well as to smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Gray Robinson, president of a company that specializes in fighting indoor air 
pollution, ACVA Atlantic Inc., said an airline passenger is more likely to get 
sick from bacteria, fungi and viruses floating in the poorly ventilated air 
than from cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, there has been no evidence of excessive levels of carbon monoxide, 
airborne particulates or nicotine, all of which have been linked to tobacco 
smoke as a source," Robinson said.

DOMINO'S DRIVERS UNDER 18 FIRED AFTER RASH OF ACCIDENTS

Domino's Pizza Inc., under criticism for a series of fatal traffic accidents 
involving its delivery drivers, has told its stores to fire or reassign drivers 
who are under the age of 18, a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Domino's spokesman Ron Hingst said federal law prohibited the company from 
hiring drivers younger than 18, but in some cases people hired for other tasks 
have ended up delivering pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
The new order will affect about 300 employees at Domino's company-owned stores, 
about one-third of the Domino's 5,000 stores nationally, he said. The franchise 
stores are being urged to make the same move. 
</P>
<P>
The company's directive led to confusion at a Miami Domino's store that gave 
pink slips to all its under-18 employees Wednesday. Those under 18 who do not 
drive were rehired later that day, the company stated.

COURT SETS ASIDE AWARD IN SEX-BIAS CASE

<P>
The Supreme Court today set aside an award of more than $180,000 in attorneys' 
fees stemming from a 1970 sex-bias lawsuit against Trans World Airlines by 
female flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
In a 6-2 decision, the court said people who intervene on the side of 
defendants in civil rights cases -- but who themselves are not found to have 
violated anyone's rights -- generally cannot be forced to reimburse the lawyer 
fees incurred by those who successfully sue. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated case stems from a lawsuit filed 19 years ago that challenged 
TWA's policy of firing female flight attendants when they became mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was resolved in 1979 when TWA agreed to reinstate fired women and 
grant them seniority from the date of their dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
The airline, which had abandoned its "no motherhood" policy soon after the suit 
was filed, also created a $3-million fund for the fired attendants. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was challenged by the Independent Federation of Flight 
Attendants on behalf of TWA flight attendants who could have suffered by being 
laid off before those with the newly won seniority. 
</P>
<P>
The union acted in the case as an intervenor, a concerned third party not named 
as a plaintiff or defendant.

HENDERSON TRADE SHAKES YANKEE PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

For years, the residents of the Yankees' clubhouse were mostly unaffected by 
personnel moves. When news of the Yankees' trade of Rickey Henderson to Oakland 
hit, however, few players could dismiss it. Even fewer embraced it. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees players saw Henderson as a force and believed that their team and 
its chances had been diminished by his departure. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you replace a player like Rickey?" Don Slaught said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned not to be surprised by what goes on in this game," Jesse Barfield 
said. "But I guess you can say this one surprised me." And hurt him, too. "I'm 
disappointed personally." 
</P>
<P>
Mel Hall, who liked to identify himself as Henderson's best friend on the team, 
expressed disbelief. "Amazing," he said as he learned of the trade Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The trade brought outfielder Louis Polonia and pitchers Eric Plunk and Greg 
Cadaret to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans were surprised that the club had dealt a player of great magnitude 
for unproven players. "We haven't done that here except with Jack (Clark)," 
pitcher Dave Righetti said. "I'm trying to figure out what direction we're 
going in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss a guy like that. No question. We've been having trouble 
scoring runs. This is the last thing I expected to see. Before he got here, we 
were a good team. When he got here in '85, we became a damn good team right 
away. He had that 'try-to-get-me-out' arrogance. Our whole lineup was like that 
last year. I hope he doesn't come back and beat us. But you know he will 
someday." 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly tried to evaluate the situation realistically, knowing the 
Yankees stood to lose Henderson to free agency and get little in return after 
the season if they did not sign him. "It's a tough situation for everybody," he 
said. "I don't think they wanted to let him go."

</P>

ERA OF THE 'BAD BOYS' IS OVER, SAYS MVP DUMARS

Joe Dumars today said the Detroit Pistons are going to turn all the "Bad Boys" 
T-shirts into collectors' items. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get away from being the Bad Boys," Dumars said after accepting the 
NBA Finals' most valuable player trophy from Sport Magazine. "Now that Rick 
Mahorn is gone, the Bad Boys are gone. When you lose a member of a team, you 
are never that team any more. We decided on the way to the White House that 
without Rick, we can't be the Bad Boys." 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn was lost to the team in the NBA expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't be easy without Rick," Dumars said. "He gave us things that were 
intangible. He got other teams frustrated and ready to fight instead of ready 
to play." 
</P>
<P>
Dumars, the most soft-spoken of the Pistons, said he wasn't uncomfortable with 
the Pistons' outlaw image. "I was never really a part of the Bad Boys image, 
but it never bothered me," he said. "Not all of the Oakland Raiders were bad 
guys and not all of the Los Angeles Lakers were Showtime."
