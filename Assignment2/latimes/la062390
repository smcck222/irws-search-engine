SAN DIEGANS AWAIT WORD ON IRAN RELATIVES

Shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday, San Diego resident Mohammad Nyakoui got a call 
from his wife, who is spending the summer in the Caspian Sea coastal city of 
Rasht, Iran, with her family. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her what she was doing, and she said she was watching the World Cup," 
Nyakoui recalls. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 minutes after she hung up, Rasht and other cities in Iran's northern 
region were rocked by an earthquake that killed thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in San Diego, it was several hours before Nyakoui even heard news of 
the quake. When he did, some quick time-zone arithmetic showed that he had 
talked to his wife just minutes before the quake happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very worried," Nyakoui said. "I tried through the Red Cross to call 
Iran, but they told us they couldn't do anything before 48 hours passed." 
</P>
<P>
One of about 25,000 San Diego Iranians in the same anxious state, Nyakoui was 
luckier than most: His wife managed to call him a second time that day, about 
eight hours after the quake, to tell him she and their two children were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Phone lines remained jammed Friday, other Iranian-Americans in San Diego said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of panic. It's just impossible to get through," said Houshang 
Ghashghai, who teaches political science at San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Already though, some of the worried immigrants were turning their fear into 
action by mobilizing relief efforts for Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Hamid Biglari, a theoretical physicist at UC San Diego, was among those who 
organized a local group to gather contributions for the United Nations Fund for 
the Iran Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The group has set up two offices and phone lines. They are collecting medicine, 
food and a variety of living supplies, including blankets, light clothing and 
flashlights. The supplies will be transported by the United Nations, Biglari 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another group gathering medical supplies is Southwest Medical Teams, an 
organization whose last major international effort was sending volunteers and 
medical supplies to Armenia after the 1988 quake there. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Medical Teams won't be sending any volunteers this time, said 
director Barry La Forgia. 
</P>
<P>
"That's at the advice of the State Department. They couldn't ensure our safety 
over there, and we don't want to endanger any of our volunteers," La Forgia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE TO SEND AID 
</P>
<P>
Donations for Iranian earthquake relief are being taken in San Diego by two 
groups: 
</P>
<P>
 United Nations Fund for the Iran Earthquake (467-1120 or 456-4000) -- 
Collecting antibiotic and analgesic drugs, collapsible plastic water 
containers, plastic sheeting, 220-volt portable generators of less than 10 
kilowatts, tents, blankets, dry food, light clothing, flashlights and lighting 
equipment. Bring items or mail checks to 4540 Kearny Villa Road, Suite 214, San 
Diego 92123; or to 7509 Girard Ave., Suite A, La Jolla 92037. Checks should be 
made out to the U.N. Fund for the Iran Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Medical Teams (284-7979) -- Through Thursday, collecting sutures, 
surgical gloves, antibiotics, analgesics (including aspirin), vitamins, 
ophthalmic solutions and empty blood collection bags. Shipment will be sent 
July 2. Cash donations will be used to pay to fly the supplies to Iran. Mail 
checks to 3547 Camino del Rio South, Suite C, San Diego 92108, noting that

THE DROUGHT: CONSERVATION; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI TO CONSIDER EMERGENCY PLAN TO SAVE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Simi Valley City Council on Monday will consider adopting a mandatory water 
conservation ordinance that would only be implemented in the event of an 
emergency, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which supplies water to 
areas of the east county, has urged all of its customers to adopt water-saving 
ordinances so that they will be prepared if cuts in their water supplies become 
necessary, said Ron Coons, director of Simi Valley's Department of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials said Friday that they will reassess statewide drought 
conditions next month to determine if any cuts are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot voluntarily conserve water, then this may be prudent for us to 
do," Coons said of the possibility of implementing the mandatory measures. 
</P>
<P>
The city has already taken some actions to reduce water usage. Earlier this 
month, the council voted to require all new construction projects to use 
ultra-low flush toilets and urinals. The city is also providing water-efficient 
shower heads free of charge and continues to send out notices urging residents 
to voluntarily conserve. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Councilwoman Ann Rock said, the city several years ago undertook a 
major capital improvement program to reduce the amount of water leaking from 
city pipes from about 12% to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have done a great deal," Rock said. "What else we can do depends on 
the severity of the drought. It may be that sometime in the future we are going 
to have to mandate. We're pretty much dependent on what the Metropolitan Water 
District is going to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
Coons said city staff had consulted with water officials as well as business 
people in the community to get their assistance in putting the mandatory water 
conservation ordinance together. 
</P>
<P>
Should the need arise, the mandatory ordinance would be implemented in three 
phases, with each phase requiring a public hearing before it could take effect, 
Coons said. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties for violations of the ordinance would range from a simple warning to 
fines and other stringent measures, such as requiring customers to install 
water efficient shower heads, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the ordinance, residents would be prohibited from 
watering their lawns between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and watering would only be 
allowed every other day. Residents would not be allowed to fill fountains or 
ponds except with recycled water, and restaurants could not serve water unless 
it was requested. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the ordinance would include limiting the watering of lawns 
between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. every third day, Coons said. Water-dependent 
industries, such as commercial nurseries and golf courses, would be required to 
water before 10 a.m. or after 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Phase three would involve a 20% reduction in water usage by all residents. Some 
restrictions would include watering lawns by bucket or by slow-drip irrigation, 
city officials said.

RELEASE OF STERILE MEXFLIES MAY MATE THE PEST OUT OF EXISTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Cajon's first shipments of sterile Mexican fruit flies arrived Thursday for 
five days of incubation before being released as the vanguard of an effort to 
mate the pest out of existence locally. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen million sterile Mexflies will be released weekly in El Cajon through 
the summer during the second phase of the state's eradication effort. 
</P>
<P>
Three aerial sprayings of malathion during the past month were designed to kill 
most of the fertile wild flies, and the steriles are supposed to take care of 
the rest within two to three generations. 
</P>
<P>
The first release is scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The sterile flies are just as important as the spraying and need to be just as 
effective to eradicate this pest," said Bill Routhier, area manager of the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Two shipments of pupae -- the fly's third growth stage -- arrived Thursday at 
the state's Mexfly headquarters in Santee, including one batch that had been 
scheduled to arrive late Wednesday. Each shipment has 4 million pupae. 
</P>
<P>
Mexfly officials were irritated that the shipment was bumped from a Continental 
Airlines flight that ran out of luggage space, but the delay caused only minor 
damage to the pupae and will have no significant effect on the overall 
eradication effort, said John Worley, director of the Mexican Fruit Fly Rearing 
Facility near Mission, Tex., the only place in the world that raises sterile 
Mexflies. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of each batch never reach sexual maturity for a variety of reasons, 
but the delay probably ruined another 10% of the pupae, Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
Any interruption of the lab-raised flies' carefully controlled growth stages 
increases their mortality rate and diminishes the adult insects' flying 
ability, sexual aggressiveness and life span, Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexfly officials chastised the airline for leaving the first shipment behind 
and have decided to pay a priority shipping cost of $20 per 50 pounds of pupae 
to ensure that no more batches are delayed, Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
Several pupae from each shipment are placed in small cages to measure the 
percentage of pupae that emerge into adults, the rate of emergence and the 
overall physical quality of the adult flies, Routhier said. 
</P>
<P>
The first shipments of pupae -- irradiated and dyed orange to distinguish the 
steriles from wild flies -- were placed in paper bags and small cardboard 
buckets where they will incubate for five days in one of the many mobile 
trailers that make up the temporary Mexfly headquarters near Gillespie Field. 
</P>
<P>
After hatching, the adult flies will feed briefly on a gelatinous mixture of 
sugar and yeast in the buckets. They will be released from trucks moving slowly 
through the infested areas, Tuesdays through Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
Although more than 200 million flies will be released in El Cajon during the 
summer, they will pose little problem for local residents and pets, Worley 
said. The flies are not aggressive and do not bite but might be attracted by 
the strong odor of wet paint and the shade of carports to escape the summer 
heat, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen million pupae -- or 1 million per square infested mile per week -- are 
scheduled to arrive weekly in Santee. Trapping has been intensified to monitor 
the success of the sterile mating program. 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, officials released the first batch of sterile flies Tuesday, where 
14 square miles were found to be infested with the Mexfly this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Mexflies, natives of northern Mexico, destroy citrus by laying eggs in the 
fruit. The eggs develop into larvae, which feed inside the fruit before 
crawling out to burrow into the ground and develop into mature flies. 
</P>
<P>
They are prolific breeders during their typical four- to six-week life span. 
Females are capable of laying 1,000 to 2,000 eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Each shipment of sterile flies contains males and females, but the success of 
the eradication program is based primarily on the sterile males numerically 
overwhelming the wild females so only non-viable eggs are laid. 
</P>
<P>
Mexflies prefer grapefruit but also lay eggs in other types of citrus.

THE SHOW GOES ON;

<P>
STUDENTS STAGE PLAY TO HONOR FORMER TEACHER GUILTY OF MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Achild molestation case quite literally took a dramatic turn Friday when a 
group of Camarillo High School students staged a production of "Macbeth" in 
honor of their former drama teacher, who is scheduled to be sentenced next week 
on child molestation charges. 
</P>
<P>
The classic tragedy was staged in a makeshift theater in the back yard of 
William H. Fisher, who pleaded guilty last month to four misdemeanor charges of 
child molestation for hugging female students and making sexual comments to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Each charge could bring a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Sentencing is set for 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 13 cast members in Friday's production were scheduled to be in a 
production of the play that Fisher was directing and hoping to perform last 
fall. But the play was never performed because Fisher was suspended from his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, according to a notice of the production sent out by students, the 
students decided to finally put on the show under Fisher's direction as "a 
celebration of solidarity and belief in this fine man." 
</P>
<P>
"We know Mr. Fisher, we know who he is and what he stands for," said Jeannette 
Maxwell, 18, who graduated from Camarillo High last year. "He was the kind of 
teacher you could talk to about things you couldn't share with your parents or 
other teachers. I looked to him as a father figure and a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell said cast members did not believe the allegations of nine female 
students who complained to investigators that Fisher made sexual remarks in 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it happened, and neither does anyone else in the cast," 
Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Fisher, 43, called his dismissal from Camarillo in 
November a "witch hunt" stemming from an affair that he had with one of his 
students while he was a teacher in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County prosecutors have said Fisher had an affair with a 14-year-old 
student and had paid for her abortion after she became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
But Fisher said Friday that the student was 16, that the two were in love and 
that he had given her a diamond ring and had hoped to marry her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm being punished for my past," Fisher said. "I made a mistake eight years 
ago when I had a relationship with a student I loved very deeply. It was wrong, 
and I know it was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher acknowledged that he had violated a position of trust by falling in love 
with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
But he said prosecutors attempted to make the affair "sound ugly, like I was a 
pervert. But that was not the case. We had a mutual, loving, caring 
relationship. They wanted to make me sound like a slime ball, and I wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said his decision to resign from the Irvine School District was by 
mutual agreement. Despite the incident there, Fisher was hired by Camarillo 
High School. He said Friday that he deliberately omitted details on his 
application of why he left Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
At Camarillo High, prosecutors said, students complained that Fisher made 
sexual remarks in the classroom about the bodies of his female students. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his guilty plea, Fisher denied the allegations of sexual molestation 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have acted inappropriate from time to time -- and I'm not talking about 
in a sexual manner," he said. "But I've never sexually molested anyone in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher described one female student, who claimed that he had fondled her knee 
during a rehearsal of a play, as "a flat-out liar." He said a video camera had 
taped the alleged incident, proving that it did not occur as she described it, 
and that he had presented the tape to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, however, said he decided to plead guilty to the four child molestation 
charges as a "compromise for no jail time" and to spare his students from 
having to take sides and testify in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"My main reason for pleading guilty is I don't want the kids to go through the 
trauma of a trial because of the stress involved," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher and student director Aaron Craig, who is playing Macbeth in the 
production, said they expected about 50 to 75 guests, mostly family and friends 
of the cast members, at private stagings Friday and Saturday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
The cast members, who are doubling and tripling up to portray the 28 characters 
in the play, have been rehearsing at a local community center and at Fisher's 
home for nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Hodges, the mother of cast member Rochelle Hodges, 16, said she planned 
to attend tonight's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Fisher has always been very kind to Rochelle, especially after her father 
died," said Hodges, 52. "I talked to her lengthily about the situation and she 
told me she has never seen or heard anything inappropriate, sexual, whatever. . 
. . If I felt there was anything to the story, I certainly wouldn't have her 
there. I believe in her judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Cast members credited Fisher with founding Camarillo's drama department. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just great," said Maria Kleschick, a 1989 Camarillo graduate who is 
portraying Lady Macbeth. "They went from no drama department to a fantastic 
drama department." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said the production could be his last chance to work with 
high-school-age students, depending on what happens at Monday's sentencing. He 
said he has already relinquished his teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
"After 21 years, I have to start over again in another field," said Fisher, who 
added that he is hoping to find work in theater arts. "Whether I was found 
guilty or acquitted, I'm never going to teach again at public schools. I'm 
moving on to something else."

ROBBER SAYS HE HAS AIDS, SHOOTS MAN

<P>
An armed man shot the manager of a Ventura gas station during a robbery Friday 
after saying that he "didn't care anymore" because he had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Joea Singh Rattan, 25, of Simi Valley was taken by ambulance to the 
Ventura County Medical Center, where he was treated for a wound in the back of 
the knee and released. 
</P>
<P>
He will return to the hospital Tuesday for an operation to remove the bullet, 
said Sgt. Roger Nustad of the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police are searching for the robber who knocked on Rattan's office door about 
6:45 a.m. as the manager counted money from sales at the Shell Oil Co. Food 
Mart at 2440 S. Victoria Ave., Nustad said. 
</P>
<P>
Rattan looked through the peephole in the door of the office, situated in a 
building about 100 feet from the cashier and grocery store area of the gas 
station, Nustad said. 
</P>
<P>
Rattan later told an employee that he opened the door because he thought the 
man was bringing an expected soda delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The man then rushed in, pushed Rattan to the ground and pulled out a gun, 
Nustad said. 
</P>
<P>
"The man said, 'I have AIDS. I don't care anymore. Give me your money,' " 
Nustad said. 
</P>
<P>
As the man grabbed the money on Rattan's desk, the manager tried to escape 
through the open door but was shot by the robber, who then fled, Nustad said. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Magdaleno, the only cashier on duty at the station, said she did not see 
the robber or notice that the office door had opened. She was preoccupied with 
helping the 14 customers who had arrived during the store's busiest morning 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Magdaleno, 22, of Oxnard, said she was alerted to the shooting only after a 
customer who had just bought some food returned to the store to tell her that 
the manager was lying next to his office. 
</P>
<P>
She said she ran over to Rattan while a customer called an ambulance.

<P>
The jury in Richard T. Silberman's money-laundering trial finished its fourth 
day of deliberations Friday, completing its first week of debate without a 
decision in the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
The jury passed no notes Friday and gave no indication when it might conclude 
its work. The jury resumes deliberations Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., is awaiting a verdict on seven felony counts. He is accused of laundering 
$300,000 that an undercover FBI agent allegedly told Silberman was the proceeds 
of Colombian cocaine dealing. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Silberman faces up to 75 years in prison. His trial, before U.S. 
District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, began May 1.

HEARING SLATED ON GUEST-HOUSE PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ojai City Council will hold a public hearing Tuesday to consider extending 
a temporary ban on guest-house building permits for 10 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director William Prince said his staff needs more time to research how 
to prevent illegal guest-house rentals. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from residents about increased density in their neighborhoods led 
the council to adopt a 45-day moratorium last month. The temporary ban was 
established to allow city planners to determine how many guest homes are in the 
city, begin a public information program on their proper use and consider a 
zoning amendment or other ways to crack down on illegal conversions. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that getting out the proper information is laying the groundwork for 
enforcement," Prince said. "At this point, we're still brainstorming ideas on 
how to deal with this." 
</P>
<P>
Although guest-house applicants have to agree that they will not install a 
kitchen or allow the structure to be occupied for more than 30 days at a time, 
city officials said it is fairly easy to convert the units to permanent 
rentals. Prince said records show that the city has granted about 50 permits in 
the past 20 years for guest houses or accessory dwellings with plumbing. Eleven 
were issued in the past year. "We're preparing a letter to all the owners 
reminding them of the appropriate use of the structures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has also started running a classified advertisement in a local 
newspaper to alert potential renters that it is against the law for homeowners 
to rent guest houses. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who rent these do not appreciate that it's not a bona fide 
rental," Prince said. "The sewers or septic systems may not be designed for the 
additional load, or the electrical system may not be able to carry more 
appliances." THIA BELL

<TEXT>
<P>
I am not a patient man to begin with, and spending 40 minutes at a dead stop in 
traffic while a bunch of clowns repave a highway that doesn't need it in the 
first place is not likely to sweeten my disposition. 
</P>
<P>
What made it worse this particular morning on Topanga Canyon Boulevard was my 
position in line behind a Ford van plastered with bumper stickers that 
proclaimed the driver's stance on everything from the Boy Scouts of America to 
ownership of a springer spaniel. 
</P>
<P>
Under less trying circumstances I might have simply shrugged at the man's 
presumption that anyone gave a damn about his love of Jesus, Robocop and the 
National Institute for Suicide Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
But being locked behind him for 40 minutes and having to read those things 
evoked an image of a self-righteous, close-minded jackass who would someday go 
berserk and gun down the entire clientele of a Westside hot dog stand because 
God told him to. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I got home I was not only enraged by the traffic delay and the 
man's hypocrisy, but at my own vision of him exploding, arming himself and 
heading for the red hots. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's got to be done about this," I grumbled as I walked into the house. 
</P>
<P>
My wife was sitting on the floor surrounded by parts of a rototiller, sketching 
a diagram of each part as she removed it from the tiller's engine. 
</P>
<P>
"Setting the world straight is one hell of a job," she said without looking up. 
Then she asked, "Do you know what a carburetor looks like?" 
</P>
<P>
Today's topic is man's patience under stressful conditions, and how those 
conditions shape his responses in a marital situation. 
</P>
<P>
Right, it's a husband-wife column. If you've got something more significant to 
read it's best you get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
I, on the other hand, am still fuming over the long wait on Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard and the bumper stickers plastered over the back of that van. 
</P>
<P>
Asking if I know what a carburetor looks like is not a terrific question to hit 
me with when I am in a bad mood, but Cinelli never worries about that. By her 
estimate, I have been in a bad mood for 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you care that the man was a time bomb of hatred?" I asked, foaming 
slightly at the corners of my mouth. 
</P>
<P>
It's an ethnic trait. I've noticed others of my race foaming when they are in a 
rage. By contrast, you rarely see a Dane foam. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me reconstruct the core of your pique," she said. "You had to wait while 
they worked on the road, you were behind a vehicle with bumper stickers you 
hated and you have no idea what a carburetor is, right?" 
</P>
<P>
The woman is amazing. 
</P>
<P>
She is not only psychic but cultured and patient as well. The other night, for 
instance, she watched all five hours of "Gotterdammerung" on KCET. I had 
trouble concentrating on a rented video of "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." 
</P>
<P>
We are as different as Siegfried and Brunnhilde. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why you aren't more mechanically inclined," she said. "You 
scored high in that in the Marines." 
</P>
<P>
"The test was given by a master sergeant who couldn't read," I said. "It was a 
blind guess on his part. I should have been a combat poet." 
</P>
<P>
"Then why did they put you in the infantry?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Corps requires that all combat poets serve in the infantry before they are 
assigned to specialized units of haiku, blank verse or rhyming couplets. I 
ended up in the 78th Blank Verse Battalion." 
</P>
<P>
She removed another part from the rototiller engine and held it up. "Is that 
the carburetor?" 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea," I said. 
</P>
<P>
That got to her. She is of the opinion I am capable of doing anything I want to 
do, but deny her my domestic skills out of spite. 
</P>
<P>
"You know everything when you're at work, but nothing when you're home," she 
said. "Yesterday you understood every word that man said you were talking to 
and he was about as articulate as the Mumbles character in 'Dick Tracy.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He was an editor. They aren't paid to be articulate. They are paid to be 
hostile. Someday one of them will all be at a hot dog stand with the guy in the 
van, gunning down innocent eaters." 
</P>
<P>
"Is this a carburetor or not?" she demanded, becoming increasingly angry. 
"Pretend some sexy, dark-eyed cookie is asking." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, in that case, sure, it's a carburetor, cookie. I see it as a device for 
mixing vaporized fuel with air to produce. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Exit Brunnhilde, fuming, to find a picture of a carburetor in the dictionary, 
while Siegfried tried to recall what he'd been angry about in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
It requires a certain amount of courage at that to face the world armed only 
with bumper stickers.

BIRD WATCHERS HELP TERNS NEST IN PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armed with signs, two-way radios and portable fences, Ventura County 
bird-watchers are helping safeguard a small gray-and-white bird species that 
faces extinction. 
</P>
<P>
The California least tern, listed as being at risk since 1970, nests along the 
California coastline between the months of May and August. Nesting sites in 
Ventura County include a section of the Santa Clara River estuary in Ventura, 
Point Mugu and Ormond Beach in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The birds lay their purple-and-brown speckled eggs near the water and must be 
protected from beach-goers, who could easily trample them, said Don Davis, vice 
president of the western Ventura County chapter of the Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
The birds scrape a spot in the sand and lay their eggs, which are well 
camouflaged. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are protected at their breeding grounds at Point Mugu because the 
Navy property is off-limits to most people. And the Ormond Beach nesting area, 
a favorite for off-road vehicles, has been partially sealed off and is 
patrolled by the Oxnard Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Santa Clara River estuary, the terns nest in an increasingly popular 
area. So for the past five years, the Audubon Society -- with help from the 
city of Ventura, the Ventura Port District, the state Fish and Game Commission 
and McGrath State Beach rangers -- fences a 500-by-200-foot area of beach as a 
breeding ground from late April to late August. 
</P>
<P>
The four-foot-high chain-link fence cuts the area off to foot traffic and is 
surrounded by signs informing people that it is a nesting area. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, about 45 Audubon Society members rotate shifts from noon until 
dark, answering questions and keeping people at a distance from the birds, who 
make a distinctive sound like a Kewpie doll squeaking, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are understanding and cooperative," said monitor Bobbe Dorsey of 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
But unleashed dogs have to be chased away, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Monitors carry two-way radios to notify rangers or police if they need help but 
have not had to use them, Dorsey said. 
</P>
<P>
The fence also protects the terns from wild cats, foxes and weasels that live 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The terns themselves handle threats from aerial predators. 
</P>
<P>
When a sea gull flies over the nesting area, the colony of about 45 terns takes 
flight and harasses it. 
</P>
<P>
"Terns are very agile and can fly loops around a poor old lumbering gull," 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the colony is larger than usual, in part because the Point Mugu 
nesting ground was washed out by a storm Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It is now mating season for the gray-and-white birds, which are about nine 
inches long with a 20-inch wing span. In the birds' mating ritual, the male 
first presents the female with a fish and bobs his head repeatedly. After they 
mate, the female lays one to four eggs within a couple of days. Incubation 
lasts 3 1/2 weeks with parents taking turns on the nest. 
</P>
<P>
Within a day of breaking from the shell, the speckled chicks can scurry to hide 
under the short dune plants. 
</P>
<P>
Both parents catch minnows and sticklebacks from nearby ponds or smelt from the 
ocean to feed their hungry brood. 
</P>
<P>
As chicks grow feathers, the family leaves the nest to live by various ponds in 
the county, including those at golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, the terns fly south to winter in southern Baja California and 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, about 1,233 pairs of least terns bred at 28 sites between San Diego 
and the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a field study by the state 
Department of Fish and Game. CAROL WEINSTOCK

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police SWAT team was negotiating late Friday night with a man who 
police said fired 30 to 40 shots at officers who had come to the hotel to 
question him. 
</P>
<P>
"He has made the statement that he's not going to be taken alive," said Officer 
S. M. Lawford at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported by late Friday night, and police believed no hostages 
are involved. 
</P>
<P>
Police were planning to bring the man's girlfriend to the Western Shores Motel, 
4345 Mission Bay Drive, to try to persuade the man to give up. 
</P>
<P>
Lawford said officers went to the hotel about 8:20 p.m. Friday to question the 
man, who is on parole from prison, about an attempted robbery or kidnaping. The 
man opened fire, shooting 30 to 40 rounds from what is suspected to be a 
semiautomatic weapon, pinning the officers down. The SWAT team arrived shortly 
afterward to relieve the officers. The other rooms in the motel were cleared. 
</P>
<P>
The motel is about a block from Mission Bay Hospital. The hospital's parking 
lot was being used as a command center for the operation.

HEALTH OFFICIALS MAY LOSE TOBACCO FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County health officials are concerned that they will have to forfeit 
hundreds of thousands of dollars from a state tobacco tax fund designated to 
finance medical care for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they will have to return the money if physicians do not 
claim their share of the county's $5.6-million allotment of the state's 
Proposition 99 fund. Of that amount, about $1 million reimburses physicians for 
treating indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, physicians who provided indigent care have been required by law 
to prove that they tried for six months to collect payment from their indigent 
patients before submitting a reimbursement claim. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, when the law was enacted, if a doctor saw an indigent patient, 
they had to wait half a year to bill the county," said county Health Care 
Agency Director Phillipp Wessels. But in April, the state Legislature reduced 
the waiting time to three months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wessels said of the $1 million available for physician reimbursement, only 20 
claims totaling $11,337 were submitted as of June 4. 
</P>
<P>
The county will have to return unused money to the state by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to be considered by the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, 
Wessels said he is concerned that if the county does not use its full allotment 
this year, it will receive less of the state's tobacco initiative fund next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In distributing the tobacco tax revenue, Wessels says county officials have 
reimbursed the Ventura County Medical Center $1.6 million for indigent health 
care and arranged payments of $1.8 million to the other seven hospitals in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco fund has also subsidized the county's Public Health Department to 
provide measles vaccinations to 3,000 schoolchildren. It also provided 
furnishings and equipment for waiting rooms and examination rooms at clinics.

GOVERNOR OKS PORT PLAN TO BAIL OUT IMPERIAL BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday signed a measure that allows financially 
ailing Imperial Beach to save more than $1 million a year by giving away its 
beachfront to the San Diego Unified Port District for upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, sponsored by Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita), was viewed by 
Imperial Beach officials as the key in helping them pull the south San Diego 
County city of 24,500 residents out of its financial tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
A state auditor general's report released earlier this year said the city would 
go broke by January, 1992, without the Deddeh legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We surely feel relieved that it's through the process, and it gives us a firm 
base for a way to map out our future," Imperial Beach City Manager Ron Jack 
said Friday about the signing of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The law immediately transfers 403 acres of Imperial Beach tidelands to the 
wealthy Port District, which has agreed to reimburse the city slightly more 
than $1 million a year to provide maintenance, lifeguards, fire and police 
services over the 3 1/2-mile beachfront, including upkeep for the controversial 
fishing pier. 
</P>
<P>
The port will also take over about $350,000 in annual bond payments to pay off 
a $2.9-million renovation of the pier, where a sportfishing operation and 
tackle shop are more than a year late in starting up. 
</P>
<P>
Without the reimbursement from the port, the financially strapped city would 
have been forced to shoulder the cost of upkeep on its own -- an amount that 
has sapped the city of up to 30% of its municipal budget. 
</P>
<P>
The expenses would have driven the city into bankruptcy by 1992, according to a 
state auditor general's report released earlier this year. Without the 
responsibility of the tidelands, the city can expect to pull out of its 
tailspin and accrue a $1.2-million surplus by 1996, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach's financial woes increased over the past decade when city 
officials began using financial reserves to make up for shortfalls in municipal 
revenues. Then, in 1986 and 1987, the city lost $300,000 on bad stock market 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Those miscues were compounded by the 1988 decision to renovate the 1,500-foot 
fishing pier with the expectation of making the money back through leasing it 
to commercial ventures. Although the city leased the pier, the businesses have 
yet to begin operating, leaving Imperial Beach holding the bag for the bond 
payments.

JUDGE SAYS CITY MUST ZONE AREA FOR PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
WARNER RIDGE: IN A SETBACK FOR COUNCILWOMAN PICUS AND SOME HOMEOWNERS, THE 
COUNCIL IS ORDERED TO LET A COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROCEED IN LINE WITH THE 
GENERAL PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a major blow to Councilwoman Joy Picus and her homeowner allies, a Superior 
Court judge Friday ordered the Los Angeles City Council to grant a developer 
the zoning needed to build a commercial complex on the controversial Warner 
Ridge property in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski unraveled a two-year campaign 
by Picus and the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization to prevent developer 
Jack Spound and Johnson Wax Development Co. from building an office project on 
Warner Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Zebrowski gave the council 60 days to zone the property, between Pierce College 
and Warner Center on De Soto Avenue, for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
The judge held that a council decision Jan. 24 to impose residential zoning on 
the property violated a state law that requires that zoning agree with the 
community plan. The plan designates Warner Ridge for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
"No reasonable person can seriously believe that a zoning ordinance which 
prohibits all commercial uses in an area designated in the General Plan for 
commercial uses is 'consistent' with the plan in any meaningful sense of the 
word 'consistent,' " Zebrowski wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In his four-page decision, the judge dealt only with the question of whether 
the city violated a state law that requires plans and zoning to be in sync. 
Zebrowski did not address several other legal challenges posed in the lawsuit 
filed against the city by the Spound-Johnson Wax partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Robert McMurry, attorney for the developer, said Zebrowski's ruling served to 
warn that there are limits to the broad discretionary powers the council wields 
in land-use matters. "While the council has great discretion, it is not 
unfettered," McMurry said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extraordinary for the council to have taken eight to nine years of its 
own planning and . . . toss it out the window," McMurry said. In its lawsuit 
against the city, the Spound-Johnson Wax partnership alleges that Picus 
engineered the zoning barrier in a desperate bid to appease politically potent 
homeowners. "We allege that she was politically motivated," McMurry said. 
</P>
<P>
Picus and her staff refused comment on the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Anthony Alperin said he was assessing the ruling and 
preparing to discuss it with the council in executive session. Alperin declined 
to say whether he would recommend that the city appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We would expect the city to appeal this," said Robert Gross, president of the 
Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization. Gross also said that the organization 
may consider intervening in the case to protect its interests. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ecstatic," Spound said of Zebrowski's ruling. "All I know now is that 
I'm going to do everything I can to vest my rights as soon as possible." Once a 
developer's project is vested -- meaning construction has actually begun -- it 
usually cannot be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Spound also indicated that, even after his victory, he intends to keep the 
legal pressure on the city. "We're going to continue with the rest of our case, 
including our case for damages," Spound said. "That's the only way to work with 
guys who've been beating me on the head all this time." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership claims it pays $330,000 per month in carrying costs on 
outstanding loans on the property, now vacant. 
</P>
<P>
Zebrowski heard oral arguments in the case Thursday. In his remarks from the 
bench, the judge strongly indicated that he found the discrepancy between the 
community plan designation and zoning for the property illegal. But he did not 
specify whether he would order the city to bring the plan into conformity with 
the zoning -- as Picus and the city wished -- or the zoning into conformity 
with the plan, as the developer wanted. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling released Friday, Zebrowski settled that issue, warning the city 
that it would be an "illegal backwards approach" for it to amend the plan to 
conform with the zoning. The plan is superior to the zoning, the judge 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the community plan that includes Warner Ridge has called for 
neighborhood, office and commercial development on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the community plan designation and the fact that it certified an 
environmental impact report that deemed residential development on the site 
financially unfeasible, the council on Jan. 24 zoned the property for 
low-density residential development. 
</P>
<P>
Although he ordered commercial zoning for Warner Ridge, Zebrowski pointedly 
said his ruling did not bar the city from amending its General Plan and 
switching the commercial zoning to residential zoning after it had complied 
with his fiat. 
</P>
<P>
"The court makes no ruling regarding what procedures the city may undertake 
after amending the zoning ordinance to bring it into consistency," Zebrowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Spound and McMurry questioned whether Picus could muster the political support 
needed to undo Zebrowski's ruling. To quickly amend the General Plan, which 
would be one of the first tasks in restoring residential zoning to Warner 
Ridge, would require the close cooperation of the Planning Department, the 
Planning Commission and Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Any one of those entities could hang up or block a proposed amendment 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, for example, previously backed the Spound-Johnson Wax 
commercial project. The mayor, if he chooses, can review a proposed plan 
amendment for up to 30 days before referring it to the council. Likewise, the 
City Council's Planning Committee must give the public 10 days notice before 
taking up a plan amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a plan amendment takes nine months to a year to be processed. 
</P>
<P>
Zebrowski's ruling also raised questions about what happened to a motion, 
introduced by Picus and approved by the council in January, 1989, to amend the 
community plan to designate Warner Ridge for residential use. Because this 
amendment was never finally enacted, the city's defense was weakened. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the fate of her proposed amendment, Picus said: "It's in the 
Planning Department." 
</P>
<P>
She said she would meet with planning officials soon "to make certain it moves 
forward." The delays in getting it approved must be "due to the bureaucratic 
nature of the Planning Department," she said.

INS POLICY BRINGS PROTESTS, LONGER WAITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Each morning this week, a crowd of bleary-eyed people pressed forward toward 
the doors of the Immigration and Nationalization Service office in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the immigrants from Latin America, India and Asia had spent days in 
line outside the office, sleeping in cars or camped out in the front parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here since Sunday," a woman named Maria said in Spanish on Thursday. 
"I came all the way from Palmdale. This is unjust." 
</P>
<P>
But each morning, private security guards giving orders in Spanish and English 
permitted only about 15 applicants daily to enter the Parthenia Boulevard 
office, down from 50 to 60 applicants served daily in previous weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The others got back in line, members of a tense sidewalk community that has 
existed since a regionwide INS policy was introduced this month which 
drastically reduces the number of applicants for legalization processed each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the cutback has been angry crowds, excruciating day-and-night 
vigils and scuffles broken up by police officers outside the Parthenia 
Boulevard office and other offices that administer the legalization program 
throughout Southern California and the Western region, according to immigration 
officials and immigrants rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been near-riots outside offices," said Theresa Sanchez, executive 
director of the Labor Immigrant Assistance Project of the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits filed three years ago by the League of United Latin American Citizens 
and Catholic Social Services allege that thousands of immigrants who met the 
criteria of living in the United States since 1981 were unfairly excluded from 
applying for legalization in 1987 because they made brief trips out of the 
country. While those cases are pending in federal court, court orders require 
the INS to grant work authorization to late applicants for amnesty whose status 
is tied to the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Bill King, Western regional director of the INS immigration reform program, 
acknowledged Friday that the change in the screening of applicants has produced 
hardship and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it's causing problems for these people, but we are kind of in a 
bind," said King, who pointed out that the region encompassing California, 
Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam accounts for half of the 65,000 
lawsuit-connected applications received nationwide. "The crush of business has 
exceeded our personnel resources . . . I am very much concerned about the 
safety of these people and the safety of our own personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to June 6, applicants were given a brief initial screening and scheduled 
for later interviews to determine their eligibility for work authorization; the 
lines were long, but they moved with relative speed. 
</P>
<P>
However, King said officials have decided to hold in-depth interviews on the 
first visit rather than schedule appointments later because they have 
determined the delay violates the court order. 
</P>
<P>
King and other officials also said the policy change results from increasing 
concern about fraudulent applications, a significant lack of employees and the 
demands of the program's main mission: administrating the second phase of the 
amnesty program in which applicants complete educational requirements to become 
permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant rights advocates said the move worsens the plight of an entire class 
of immigrants who have already been unfairly excluded from the system. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy of only accepting a handful of applications must stop," said Peter 
Schey, a lawyer at the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law who 
represents the League of United Latin American Citizens and Catholic Social 
Services in the two lawsuits. "It's absurd. It's the worst kind of management 
possible. If the INS were running a corporation they would be bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
Schey questioned the argument that the original practice of brief reviews to 
schedule later appointments was ended because it violates the court order. He 
said speedier processing would at least get undocumented applicants into the 
system and reduce their fear of losing jobs or being deported. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather see them appear on a file and get a receipt of some kind," he 
said. "Something that will end the immediacy of their clandestine existences, 
their fear of getting swept up in an INS raid . . . Underlying all of this is a 
basic hostility to the lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of people were in line Friday morning outside the Parthenia 
Boulevard office, where police said complaints from surrounding businesses have 
prompted extra patrols and sporadic citations for loitering and jaywalking. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Montez, a teen-age entrepreneur pushing an ice cream cart labeled 
"Delicias de Michoacan," said business had slowed down considerably after the 
day's 15 applicants were ushered in starting at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be back Sunday night," he said. "There will be a whole lot of them."

LOPEZ LANDFILL WORKERS SAFE, DOCTOR SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: WITNESS SAYS MEN WHO WERE SICKENED BY FUMES LAST YEAR CAME IN 
CONTACT WITH TOXIC GASES DURING UNCOMMON EXCAVATION WORK. 
</P>

Lopez Canyon Landfill is safe for Los Angeles sanitation workers even though 
one worker was hospitalized for 11 days after being overcome by fumes at the 
dump last year, the city's industrial hygienist testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alex Guss told a hearing board of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District that he had investigated the March 9, 1989, incident involving the 
worker, Keith O'Kray of Newhall, and determined that he probably had been 
exposed to hydrogen sulfide, a highly poisonous gas. 
</P>
<P>
He said O'Kray, and other workers who also became ill that day, came into 
contact with a pocket of several gases during excavation work for installation 
of a gas collecting system. Guss said that unless they dig into underground gas 
pockets, workers normally do not come into contact with high concentrations of 
toxic gas at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Guss' testimony came during the sixth in a series of hearings the AQMD board is 
conducting in an examination of noxious gas emissions at the only operating 
landfill owned by the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the dump in the northeast San Fernando Valley, along with their 
city and state elected representatives, have asked the hearing board to close 
the landfill until the city controls methane gas emissions there. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD inspectors, as recently as April, found that many areas of the dump 
emitted methane gas at levels above 10,000 parts per million, 20 times more 
than the 500 p.p.m. allowed under state law. Methane gas is not toxic itself 
but is an indication of the presence of other more toxic gases, such as 
hydrogen sulfide and benzene, Guss said. 
</P>
<P>
Guss, who testified for about six hours, said that several days after the 
March, 1989, incident he tested for the presence of toxic gases in the air at 
the landfill. He said he found that all gases were within safe levels for 
workers who spend eight hours a day, five days a week at the dump. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from board members, Guss said he had not tested gas levels in 
the surrounding community of Kagel Canyon where at least three children became 
ill after breathing noxious fumes last Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people out there close to this landfill saying it stinks and they want 
us to do something about it," said board member William F. Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing board member Sharon Scott asked whether testing could be carried out in 
the community before the next hearing July 5. Deputy City Atty. Christopher 
Westhoff, representing the Bureau of Sanitation, said the city is now 
conducting such testing. But Scott asked that AQMD engineers conduct their own 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Rob Zapple of Kagel Canyon, who has led the campaign against 
the landfill, said the incident involving the worker has been whitewashed for 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, seven workers got sick that day," he said. "Two were hospitalized." 
</P>
<P>
According to a city report, O'Kray, 33, and another worker, Carlann Paul, 29, 
were hospitalized after they were exposed to unearthed materials at the north 
end of the landfill. Paul was treated and released while O'Kray remained at St. 
Joseph Medical Center in Burbank for 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said O'Kray spent six months recovering from the gas 
exposure and has since returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
Guss testified Friday that some people, including children and adults with 
chronic illnesses, are more sensitive to toxic gases than others.

PLAN FOR REGIONAL MALL ABANDONED BY ITS DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer has dropped plans to open a regional shopping mall in the Santa 
Clarita Valley, saying the area could not support both his project and another 
mall already planned by Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't by choice," Carl Nelson, vice president of Santa Fe Development Co., 
said Friday of the company's decision to abandon its mall proposal. He said the 
company also found that it simply could not compete with Newhall Land, the 
largest developer in the fast-growing Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe now intends to build a 100-acre shopping complex with discount stores 
such as Mervyn's, Price Club and Home Club, Nelson said. The site is located in 
Canyon Country, east of the Antelope Valley Freeway and Golden Valley Road. The 
company also plans an 18-hole golf course and at least 1,000 residential units 
in an adjoining development. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe announced plans for a regional mall last December, setting the stage 
for a bidding war with Newhall Land, which is trying to lure upscale department 
stores to its $180-million mall, planned for 80 acres near McBean Parkway and 
Valencia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The bidding war never materialized. Many retailers had either committed 
themselves to Newhall Land or were reluctant to talk business with Santa Fe 
because another mall already was in the works, Nelson said. Among mall builders 
there is "an unwritten code that they don't pirate tenants away" once another 
mall is in progress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
May Co. has already signed up for the Newhall Land project, and Newhall is 
negotiating with J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and Sears Roebuck and Co. The first phase 
of the Newhall mall, set to open in the spring of 1992, will include the May 
Co., a movie theater, restaurants and other stores, said Marlee Lauffer, a 
Newhall Land spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
There is no scheduled opening for the second phase which, Newhall Land 
officials hope, will include upscale department stores. The company has already 
approached Nordstrom, Robinson's and Bullock's, Lauffer said. "We're not in the 
negotiating stage, but we are talking to them," she said.

AROUND THE VALLEY: LESSON IN MIND OVER MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Amy Louise Kazmin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was billed as a workshop in telekinesis -- moving objects with the power of 
the mind -- and most of the students wanted to believe. Really. 
</P>
<P>
But although the catalogue of Learning Tree University promised that 
participants in a parapsychology workshop would discover and learn to control 
their innate psychic powers ("foster the ability to control dice and other 
objects mentally"), the class was more like a "power of positive thinking" 
workshop. 
</P>
<P>
No step-by-step instructions on how to levitate socks and direct them into the 
laundry hamper while still in bed sipping the morning coffee. No advice on 
ensuring that the dice come up seven or 11 every time. 
</P>
<P>
Instead Lee Domez, clad in a pale blue suit with a lavender striped tie and a 
teddy bear lapel pin, preached his philosophy of believe and let-believe. 
</P>
<P>
In a small, freshly painted pale-pink conference room at the Learning Tree, a 
Chatsworth school with a widely varied curriculum, Domez flashed a toothy grin 
and spouted truisms, a good ol' fashioned motivational pep talk, with a 
sprinkling of New Age terms thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be yourself," said Domez, with the fervent zeal of a TV evangelist 
revealing the Truth. "You have to march to your own drummer." 
</P>
<P>
"We create our own situations, even if it's only self-fulfilling prophesies," 
he advised. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are in total charge of our own lives. If you don't take charge of 
your life, I guarantee that there will be someone else to take charge for you." 
Sounding like a self-help guru lecturing disciples, the silver-haired, 
silver-bearded Domez admonished the four women and three men in the class not 
to be afraid to explore the world of psychic phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
"I salute each of you for being in a class like this," he congratulated them. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of us has experiences that are not logically explained, and we are afraid 
to discuss them," he said, his three silver and turquoise rings and silver 
bracelets flashing as he gesticulated, his voice rising and falling 
melodramatically. "Why are we afraid to discuss them? Because there is a thing 
out there called society. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much prejudice against what we don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Spend five minutes a day, center on who you are and just listen. You will be 
surprised with what you hear." 
</P>
<P>
But Domez was preaching to the converted, to people who have already dabbled in 
the realm of inexplicable phenomena and are not afraid to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the class said she has seen her guardian angel. Another sees 
auras of color around people. A third told classmates that when people die they 
are just "making their transitions. It's a spiritual world, and they are just 
living in another expression. I may not see them, but we are communicating 
spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
Tim, an Orange County computer programmer, talked about out-of-body experiences 
with the casual confidence of a world traveler telling a novice tourist about a 
trip to Outer Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
He told the class how his spirit left his body and went to a neighbor's house, 
where he peeped in a window. The next day, he said, his neighbor confirmed his 
account of events inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
Gwen, who lives in the Valley, spoke hesitantly about her premonitions of 
danger and ESP communication with a friend. With the shy manner of a young girl 
telling about her first kiss, Gwen explained after class that she had a vision 
of her uncle and a flame while on an evening hike with a friend during a 
camping trip. When they returned to her campfire several miles away, they found 
Gwen's uncle passed out with his arm in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Several similar experiences have convinced Gwen that she may have psychic 
powers, and nervously, she is now setting out to explore the regions of the 
Unknown. 
</P>
<P>
These weren't the kind of students who needed urging to "open their minds" and 
drop their inhibitions. They accepted telekinesis as a possibility and wanted 
concrete how-to tips and a road map, or at least convincing evidence that there 
is such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour, Domez addressed the subject of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that objects can be moved with mind power alone cannot be ruled 
out, he proffers. What else, he asked, can explain the pyramids of Egypt? 
</P>
<P>
"How did they move those big rocks in Egypt to build those pyramids? Those huge 
stones are nowhere in evidence around Giza. People say, 'slave labor,' but 
that's not logical," he said. "Even with our advanced technology today we could 
not duplicate that, and scientists have said that." 
</P>
<P>
With all other scientific explanations thus eliminated, that leaves 
telekinesis. 
</P>
<P>
"One tenet stands above all else: You must have belief," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember Uri Geller, who used to bend spoons and keys with his mind on 
television," Domez began, but was interrupted by a class participant, an 
engineer from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew him personally. We grew up together. That guy is a crook," the engineer 
protested. "Maybe all these things are possible. I'm here to learn. But it's 
obvious that what he was doing were all tricks." 
</P>
<P>
That was it. No flying socks. No odds-defying dice. 
</P>
<P>
Class dismissed.

IS IT OPINION OR IS IT FACT?; 
</P>
<P>
* LIBEL RULING IS A HUGE SETBACK FOR SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court acted with astonishing recklessness Thursday, when it 
overturned nearly two decades of precedent and ruled that the First Amendment 
does not automatically protect expressions of opinion from being found 
libelous. 
</P>
<P>
In the case at issue, Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal, the court reinstated a 
libel action brought by a high school coach, who felt a sportswriter had 
defamed him in a column. Lower courts had held the writer's comments were 
protected, since they appeared in a column. However, Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist, writing for the majority, held that columns and other forms of 
commentary may be deemed defamatory if they "imply an assertion of objective 
fact" that can be proven false. The court, Rehnquist wrote, never had "intended 
to create a wholesale defamation exemption for anything that might be labeled 
'opinion'." Opinions without "factual connotation" are entitled to protection, 
the Chief Justice said, as is "loose, figurative or hyperbolic language." 
</P>
<P>
To reach this conclusion Rehnquist first had to assert that in a case dating 
from 1974, Gertz vs. Robert Welch, the Supreme Court had not meant what every 
federal appellate court has since understood it to mean. In that decision, the 
court held that "Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false 
idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not 
on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas." 
Judges subsequently have interpreted that passage as having acknowledged a 
constitutional protection for expressions of opinion that does not extend to 
reports of fact. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist, who as associate justice dissented from the Gertz ruling, denied the 
existence of such protection in his ruling Thursday. Further, he ignored the 
standard for distinguishing opinion from fact set down by the U.S. Court of 
Appeals' D.C. circuit in its landmark 1984 decision in Ollman vs. Evans and 
Novak. That decision said an opinion could be recognized as such by, among 
other things, its context and the setting in which it was spoken or published. 
In other words, anything that appears in a newspaper column is an opinion 
because it is commonly accepted as such. 
</P>
<P>
In place of this common-sense test, the court now proposes to protect only 
something it calls "pure opinion" and hyperbole, simply leaving it to lower 
jurisdictions to imagine for themselves what that might be. The result will be 
a dramatic increase in libel litigation, a chilling of precisely the sort of 
serious speech the First Amendment was intended to protect, and chaos and 
contradiction in the state courts. However doubtful the outcome, large 
newspapers and other publications will have the means to defend their rights, 
but ordinary citizens whose only avenue of expression is the public platform 
are now encouraged by this decision to keep their opinions to themselves.

COLLEGE BOARD TO RECONSIDER PAY RAISES FOR ADMINISTRATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The governing board of Antelope Valley College, accused of violating the 
state's open-meetings law when it approved hefty pay raises for administrators 
last month, has decided to reconsider the raises in a public session, college 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came after a college employees union last week filed a formal 
legal challenge demanding the board "cure or correct" its action. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, taken in a late-night public session May 14, gave double-digit pay 
raises to three college administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The union charged that the board's action denied the opportunity for public 
comment and had violated the state Brown Act. The public had no notice because 
the raises were not listed on the agenda, and the board's entire discussion 
occurred behind closed doors before the public vote, records show. 
</P>
<P>
College officials confirmed Friday that the board has scheduled a special 
meeting for Thursday afternoon to reconsider the pay raises. Also, college 
officials promised to allow public comment on the raises, which are far larger 
than those given other college employees this year. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Antelope Valley College Federation of Classified Employees, 
which represents the college's clerical workers, said they want to know why the 
special raises for administrators were made retroactive to July, 1989, unlike 
similar increases for other college employees. 
</P>
<P>
Under the college board's vote last month, Jim McDonald, admissions and records 
director, received a 21.7% raise. Charles Whiteside, human resources and 
employee relations director, got a 16.7% raise. And Louis Lucero, disabled 
student services director, received a 12.4% raise. 
</P>
<P>
Those amounts came in addition to the 6.5% cost-of-living increases the college 
board had previously granted those officials.

THE DEATH OF A 4-YEAR-OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gilbert Perez Jr. was riding in the back seat of a car when he was hit by a 
bullet meant for someone else. He died at the age of 4. 
</P>
<P>
He, his mother and family friends were returning from a restaurant in Pomona 
when the child was struck in the head by a shot fired from another car. He died 
Thursday, another innocent lost to mindless gang violence. Today not even the 
noncombatants -- babies, children, teen-agers, mothers, fathers, grandparents 
-- are spared death because of the random gunfire of Southern California's 
mounting gang shoot-outs. They are the bystanders who happen to live in 
communities dominated by street gangs -- victims of a dangerous geography in 
the roughest sections of South-Central Los Angeles, East Long Angeles, Pomona, 
Pacoima, Garden Grove and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
They include the grandmother killed while watching television; the Boy Scout 
murdered while talking with friends; the little girl shot while playing 
softball in the yard. The innocents also include people who ordinarily only 
witness the violence when it is replayed on television. But even they have been 
killed, too, when they have been in the wrong place at the wrong time. They 
have been shot while headed to a movie, coming from a mall, after picking up a 
quick hamburger or pausing to use a pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
Random drive-by shootings and indiscriminate shoot-outs are killing and 
wounding a growing number of innocent victims, according to police. Among the 
recent survivors: an 18-month-old boy who was playing in his baby-sitter's yard 
when he was hit in the thigh; a 3-year-old girl who was sitting on the porch 
when she was hit in the arm; a 7-month-old boy who was cradled in his father's 
arms when he was shot in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
When even babies are fair game, what is the answer? Stationing the National 
Guard in gang-terrorized communities? More prisons? Gun control? Better 
schools? More social programs? More jobs? All of the above? 
</P>
<P>
We must find answers soon because the caskets, like the coffin that holds 
Gilbert Perez Jr., are getting smaller.

DEALING WITH OIL TANKER ACCIDENTS IN COASTAL WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How about kinder-gentler-safer oil spills that won't endanger any species 
including man (maybe even women and children). 
</P>
<P>
No matter how "fail safe" they make these monsters of the deep (and shallow) 
they will continue to spill and there will always be logical explanations for 
each and every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Unexpected explosions, sand bars, storms, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The oil companies should use a fleet of smaller oil tankers with a standard 
maximum of oil that can be carried that the ocean can easily accommodate to 
prevent complete devastation when spills occur. 
</P>
<P>
There will always be faulty tankers, crews, skippers and very slow inadequate 
cleanups. If these big oil companies finally realize that oil spills cost a lot 
in money and the lives of many species they might even heed an idea that isn't 
their own.

DEALING WITH OIL TANKER ACCIDENTS IN COASTAL WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Stammer's article on the plight of the Gulf of Mexico really hit home 
with me (front page, June 15). I grew up in Rockport, Texas, 30 miles north of 
Corpus Christi and until this past month, I had not seen the gulf coast for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
When a returned to the gulf, I knew there would be changes along the vast 
virgin stretches of sandy beach where my friends and I had cruised. What I 
wasn't prepared to see was a coastal garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the flotsam and bird carcasses, what I also found incredible was the 
people in the area claiming that the pollution was coming from Mexico. Of all 
the hundreds of washed up plastics and glass bottles, I never tripped over one 
that had Hecho en Mexico written on it. What I did notice were dozens of 
offshore drilling projects along the gulf horizon that didn't exist 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Where does the debris on our beaches come from? The trash cans remain empty 
while most of the garbage lay washed up onshore. The offenders are the 
companies that are involved in the exploration and transport of oil found in 
these offshore drilling projects. Isn't it time that our state and federal 
politicians take a tougher stance on the regulatory practices of offshore 
drilling as well as stronger enforcement of laws that tolerate no leakage of 
oil from these projects? 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Stammer's article, I am no longer apathetic about the 
de-gentrification of our shorelines. I am ready to join the protest. Everyone 
agrees that it's time to clean up the crime in our streets. How about cleaning 
up the crime in our oceans?

PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON VITAMINS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headline ("Skip Vitamins, Pregnant Women Told") and the lead in your 
front-page article were not fully in sync with all the information presented in 
the rest of the article -- including legitimate viewpoints favoring supplement 
use by pregnant women because of deficiencies in their diets. 
</P>
<P>
Many dietary surveys show a high frequency of deficient diets in the United 
States, with young women some of the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, supplement use prevents certain birth defects. A recent signed 
editorial comment in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. stated, "The 
biggest challenge . . . about the benefits of taking vitamins is to get women 
of childbearing age to hear and follow this simple advice." 
</P>
<P>
The National Academy of Sciences committee members whose report you cited are 
not omniscient. Nutritionists with credentials equal or superior to theirs 
differ greatly over the benefits of supplement use by pregnant women. The 
committee is not even consistent -- concern with possible nutrient interaction 
(iron's interference with zinc absorption) was not reflected in its advice to 
take iron supplements during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the committee admits to "considerable variation in nutrient 
requirements among individuals," its report failed to identify how physicians 
can determine their patients' requirements. In fact, no method that is both 
inexpensive and reliable is available.

BAKER'S MESSAGE FOR SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You chastise Shamir for being quoted in the press and then claiming a 
misunderstanding when a furor arises (editorial, June 15). Recently, Secretary 
of State James Baker testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign 
Operations on a State Department report that held that the Palestine Liberation 
Organization is still engaged in terrorism and supports a long-range strategy 
of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
While Baker conceded to the report, he testified: "Generally speaking, the PLO 
has complied with its December '88 commitments." Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) 
pointed to the inconsistency of Baker's remarks, stating: "I just don't think 
you can ride both those horses." Baker's inconsistencies do not seem to bother 
The Times. Shamir's do. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, in its 1948 Declaration of Independence, offers its hand to all its 
neighboring states in an offer of peace. In 1967, the Arab leaders adopted 
their formula of no peace, no negotiations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO is on the United States list as a terrorist organization, Yasser Arafat 
is on that list as a terrorist. Arafat is not permitted to enter the U.S. to 
address the U.N. The PLO declares in its charter that the state of Israel is 
illegal and that it intends to have all the land from the Jordan River to the 
Mediterranean Sea for a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
Now, we have Baker's message to Israel: "When you're serious about peace, call 
us." The Times seems to concur with Baker. 
</P>
<P>
There can be only one explanation for this nonsense: Meshuga! Meshuga! Meshuga!

BAKER'S MESSAGE FOR SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are my ears deceiving me or did I hear Baker imply that the new Israeli 
government might be something less than sincere in its claim to be longing for 
peace! From a Palestinian's perspective nothing is being done any more 
ruthlessly with the advent of this new government than has been done almost 
every day for the last 40 years! The Palestinians have been chased off their 
land, beaten, detained, tortured, deprived of their human rights, their civil 
liberties. 
</P>
<P>
It does, however, seem as though Baker is sincere in his desire to see some 
relief for the Palestinian people and that is a welcome relief for all caring 
people in this country and the world. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has displayed a great deal of human compassion and political 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the vision of Baker can serve as a lesson to us all: What the Israeli 
government is doing today and what it has been doing for the last 40 years is 
wrong. What is different now is that the people of the world (including Baker) 
are growing more and more impatient and intolerant of this kind of behavior.

BAKER'S MESSAGE FOR SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I surely agree with your June 13 editorial about the obdurate character of the 
new Israeli government and Shamir's unfortunate choices for his cabinet. The 
uncompromising fundamentalist extremists have put a halt to the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
But I disagree that Shamir was "forced" to turn to these extremists for 
support. No, he did it to perpetuate his power. Elections were an option. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point are the words of Israel's prize-winning novelist, Yizhar 
Smilansky: "Why do we abandon the field to all sorts of obstinate little 
politicians who don't care about blood or death or the corruption of the soul 
-- who have endless patience for death? Hundreds have died and countless more 
will die; what matters to them is that they hold the winning political card."

PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON VITAMINS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, the geniuses at the National Academy of Sciences now recommend that 
pregnant women stop taking vitamin supplements, even though vitamin 
supplementation has been shown in several studies to reduce fetal risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
Their reasoning: They fear that vitamin supplements might delude women into 
thinking they no longer need a balanced diet. 
</P>
<P>
Brilliant! 
</P>
<P>
In the same spirit, I offer the following recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
1. Immediately ban the use of automobile safety belts. Although they've been 
shown to save lives, my fear is that people feel inordinately protected when 
wearing seat belts and therefore do not exercise adequate caution when driving. 
</P>
<P>
2. Stop promoting the use of helmets for motorcycle riders. I predict 
motorcyclists would be much safer drivers if they knew they had a higher risk 
of head injury. 
</P>
<P>
3. Outlaw life preservers when water skiing. We've all seen the dangerous 
stunts water skiers perform. Without life jackets, I'm sure they wouldn't be so 
daring. 
</P>
<P>
4. Eliminate green lights. How many accidents have happened simply because a 
motorist saw a green traffic light and presumed he had the right of way? By 
restricting all traffic signals to yellow and red, many lives could be saved.

BAKER'S MESSAGE FOR SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laura Blumenfeld, a graduate student at Columbia's School of International and 
Public Affairs, writes (Commentary, June 18) that American Jews "have got to 
wake up" and begin to openly criticize Israel's policies on the West Bank and 
Gaza, for only then can we begin to move towards a just and peaceful solution. 
</P>
<P>
She is not the first American Jew to say so; many Jews, both here and in 
Israel, have criticized Israel's policies on many issues. 
</P>
<P>
But these same Jews do not seem upset that there are absolutely no Arab voices 
raised in criticism of Arab policies (either past or present) regarding the 
conflict between Israel and its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, there must be American Arabs who feel that "their side" is not always 
the "good guy with the white hat." Where are their voices? When will they speak 
out loudly and in public against the inconsistencies of Arafat, against the 
terrorist plots of Abu Abbas, against the bellicose pronouncements of Iraq's 
Suddam Hussein, against the increasing violence of Muslim fundamentalists, and 
against the murders of moderate Palestinians by their own people? When will 
they stop making excuses for atrocities committed in the name of "their" cause? 
</P>
<P>
Only when both Jewish and Arab voices are heard will peace truly have a chance 
to succeed.

AMEDEO DE FILIPPI; COMPOSER, ARRANGER, ORCHESTRATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amedeo de Filippi, who created orchestral, choral and chamber music for 
ballets, radio and philharmonic groups, has died in Burbank. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
As a composer, arranger and orchestrator, Mr. de Filippi was on the staff of 
the Columbia Broadcasting System and also worked for Pathe Films, Judson Radio 
Program Co., Victor Phonograph Co. and several theaters and publishers. 
</P>
<P>
He died June 15 of complications from a recent stroke, said his wife, Della 
Posner de Filippi. 
</P>
<P>
Born Feb. 20, 1900, in Ariano Irpino, Italy, he came to New York with his 
family in 1905. At 9, he was playing the piano with bands in Atlantic City and 
New York during the summer. He later studied violin and composition and was 
awarded a four-year fellowship in both piano and composition at the Juilliard 
Graduate School of Music in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
His "Concerto for Orchestra" won the Philharmonic-Symphony Society of New York 
American Composers Awards of 1936-37, but the award was withdrawn because he 
was not born in the United States. In 1936, his "Sonata for Violin and Piano" 
was performed at the Festival of Contemporary American Music. He also 
orchestrated ballets for the Ballet Russe and Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime member of ASCAP, Mr. de Filippi also wrote music for films, radio 
and television. He moved to Studio City in 1961 and continued to write music 
until his death. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Richard de Filippi of 
Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Adrienne Lannom of Eugene, Ore.; sisters, Mae 
Schweitzer, Adele Caffrey and Anna Pietroburgo, all of New York; and five 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A private service and burial were held this week. Arrangements werehandled by 
Pierce Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park and Mortuary in North Hollywood. 
Donations can be made in de Filippi's name to the Juilliard Graduate School 
Alumni Scholarship Fund in New York.

DODGERS GET CALL AND WIN; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: UMPIRE CHANGES MIND IN NINTH INNING, ENABLING L.A. TO BEAT REDS IN 
10TH, 7-6. 
</P>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this era of baseball players whose wallets outweigh their hearts, an 
interesting thing happened at Riverfront Stadium Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers won in a game decided by a conscience. 
</P>
<P>
Umpire Terry Tata gave the Cincinnati Reds an apparent 7-6 victory in the 
bottom of the ninth inning by calling Eric Davis safe on a two-out play at home 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
But a split-second later, realizing that Davis had been blocked from the plate 
and tagged by Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia, he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
And even as the Reds were racing from the dugout in celebration, he changed his 
call. His outspread arms returned to his side. A single fist with an 
outstretched thumb was raised. Davis was called out, and the game was sent into 
extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy disturbance by angry Red Manager Lou Piniella, the resurrected 
Dodgers scored in the 10th inning on Alfredo Griffin's two-out single for a 7-6 
victory before a crowd of 34,697. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was stolen from us," said Todd Benzinger, the Cincinnati first 
baseman whose double had apparently scored Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella said: "The umpire called the runner safe, and all of a sudden, he 
changes his mind? I've never seen that in my life, and I've been in major 
league baseball since 1969." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had never seen anything like it either, but from a different 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of courage to do what Terry Tata did," Scioscia said. "A lot of 
courage." 
</P>
<P>
Tata said the decision, which he later learned was supported by replays, was 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
"My mechanics were screwed up, I called the play too quick," he said. "I 
realized the guy never touched the plate, and I changed the call right away. 
And as long as I don't wait too long, I can change a call. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing was, I got it right." 
</P>
<P>
The play developed on Benzinger's two-out double to right field with Paul 
O'Neill on second base and Davis on first. O'Neill scored easily to tie the 
score at 6-6, but the relay throw from Hubie Brooks to Lenny Harris to Scioscia 
stopped Davis. 
</P>
<P>
In winning their season-high sixth straight game, moving within 8 1/2 games of 
the National League West-leading Reds while climbing above .500 for the first 
time since June 1 with a 34-33 record, the Dodgers displayed some of their own 
courage: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Griffin's game-winning line drive to left field came on a one-and-two count 
that featured five foul balls against loser Randy Myers, who had not allowed a 
run in 19 career appearances against the Dodgers. Griffin's hit followed an 
infield single by Eddie Murray and a walk by Mickey Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The game was rescued on the pitching mound by rookie Jim Poole in the 
bottom of the 10th after Mariano Duncan had hit a one-out single against 
reliever Jim Gott. 
</P>
<P>
Poole replaced Gott and, after falling behind Luis Quinones, three and one, 
threw two good pitches to strike him out. Poole was so excited, he thought the 
game was over and leaped off the mound in exultation. When he came to his 
senses, he was replaced by Tim Crews, who earned the save for winner Jay Howell 
by retiring Billy Hatcher on a grounder to shortstop Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
"That was totally bush," Poole said of his display. "It was like, 'Oh no. The 
rookie has just made a big mistake.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson claimed ignorance Friday concerning published speculation that he 
might soon be traded to an American League team, possibly the Detroit Tigers. 
"I don't know anything about any of that," he said. "I have not talked to 
(Dodger vice president) Fred Claire in weeks. And I will not speculate on 
speculation." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson admitted that he understood why his name would arise. "This time of 
year, a lot of people are being scouted, a lot of names are coming up, and you 
know my circumstances as well as I do. So I can see why I would be one of those 
names." Gibson, who is eligible for free agency after this season, would not 
comment on speculation that he would prefer to return to Detroit, where he 
played for nine seasons before joining the Dodgers in 1988. "It's not my place 
to talk about any of that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson will be more involved in a trade than most players because the team that 
acquires him will need to sign him for a contract extending past this season, 
or risk losing him. Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said he has heard nothing about 
an impending Gibson deal. But his concern about the need for a fifth starter, 
whom the Dodgers hope to acquire by trading Gibson or another veteran, is well 
known. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said his strained right groin felt better Friday, and he hoped to take 
batting practice today, with a return to the lineup by the end of this six-game 
trip next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
When you live for today and fail to plan for the future, eventually you pay for 
it. Donald Trump's penchant for trophy properties, like the Plaza and Taj 
Mahal, has drained his cash and brought him to the verge of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' similar quest for veteran players such as Murray, Gibson, Griffin, 
Brooks, etc., has drained the organization of talented youngsters who are now 
blossoming elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Other similarities between Trump and the Dodgers: Both seem quite adept at 
blowing their own horns, both bask in past glories and both seem reluctant to 
change their ways. 
</P>
<P>
They may also find themselves spending a lot of time in new locations: Trump in 
bankruptcy court and the Dodgers in the basement.

I've read that Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak was fed to computers and predicted 
to last 520 years (as a record). Let's do the same to six no-hitters and I'll 
bet you have a record for 1,000 years. After all, Nolan Ryan has beaten Sandy 
Koufax by 50% and the other greats by 100%.

At this time, Kansas City would probably love nothing more than to get rid of 
their multimillionaire bust, Mark Davis, who is booed every time he goes on the 
mound. The Dodgers, meanwhile, are desperate for relief pitching. Maybe Davis 
can regain his Cy Young form by returning to the National League.

Money is tight, but once in a while my 12-year-old son and I are lucky enough 
to go to a major league ballgame. When the game is over, my son rushes to beg 
for autographs, only to be yelled at, pushed, sometimes smiled at and 80% of 
the time ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Who do these players think pays their wages? Do we have to be treated as a 
disease?

Do you remember being 12? My son tells me, "Mom, some day I will make it to the 
big leagues and I will never turn away from kids."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
EXPOS BEAT PIRATES, PULL WITHIN HALF-GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few expected the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Montreal Expos to be battling for 
first place in the National League East in late June, but there they were 
Friday night, playing each other in a style worthy of the division's 1-2 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Aldrete doubled home Andres Galarraga from first base in the eighth inning 
at Montreal to give the Expos a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, who had trailed, 3-1, are only a half-game behind the slumping 
Pirates. However, bearing down on both are the division favorites, the New York 
Mets. The Mets, who were 9 1/2 games behind June 7, are only three back. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds gave the Pirates their early lead by hitting a two-run single in 
the third. With runners in scoring position, Bonds is 25 for 49 (.510) and has 
driven in 38 runs. 
</P>
<P>
He also singled, stole second and scored the Pirates' other run on Mike 
LaValliere's single in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pirates' Walt Terrell went into the seventh inning with a 
two-hitter, one of the hits a home run to center field by Larry Walker. 
</P>
<P>
But, with one out, the Expos' Tom Foley , who had struck out twice, singled. 
Pinch-hitter Otis Nixon then doubled down the left-field line to score Foley. 
Nixon stole third and scored the tying run on Dave Martinez's fly to medium 
right field. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos are in contention despite having lost lost three top pitchers -- Mark 
Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez -- and outfielder Hubie Brooks to free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a lot of heat when we let those fellows get away," Manager Buck 
Rodgers said. "We decided to go with younger, inexperienced players. We weren't 
surprised when we split the first 36 games. It was expected. 
</P>
<P>
"But this team has shown tenacity. We have an ability to come from behind. We 
also have a knack for winning close games. I'm proud of these kids." 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Philadelphia 1 -- The Mets have found a way to take the pressure 
off their pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
For the 10th game in a row, the Mets scored in the first two innings. For the 
ninth time, the early lead paid off. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at New York, Frank Viola had five runs before he went out to pitch 
the third inning and he easily became the league's first 10-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, finally playing up to their potential, chased former Dodger Ken 
Howell (8-4), who had won six in a row, before the second inning was over. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Magadan, whose hitting has sparked the Mets' drive into contention and put 
Mike Marshall on the bench, drove in two runs in the inning and extended his 
hitting streak to 11 games. He is 22 for 43 (.512) during the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I made up my mind I wouldn't lose this lead," said Viola (10-3). "Last 
Saturday they gave me a four-run lead and I blew it." 
</P>
<P>
Viola gave up eight hits, struck out eight and walked only one in eight 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really fighting myself at the start," Viola said. "There's no good 
feeling when you walk the first batter on four pitches. I knew I had to go to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, Houston 3 -- The Giants resumed their pursuit of the 
Cincinnati Reds in this game at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
After losing two in a row, the Giants took a 3-0 lead and held on for their 
17th victory in 20 games this month. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Garrelts (5-6) won his fourth consecutive decision. He left after eight 
innings with a 4-2 lead, but relief pitcher Steve Bedrosian opened the ninth by 
giving up a home run to Eric Anthony. Finally, with the potential tying run on 
second, Jeff Brantley got the last two outs. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' Robby Thompson hit his eighth home run of the season in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 7, Chicago 0 -- Most pitchers aren't too fond of Wrigley Field. 
Except on the few occasions when the wind is blowing in, the ballpark is a 
hitter's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't for the Cubs when Cardinal left-hander Joe Magrane pitches there. 
Magrane pitched a three-hitter and struck out a career-high 11 in getting his 
third shutout in four starts at Wrigley. One was a one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not had a good season," Magrane (4-9) said. "Today was one of those 
days when I had it. 
</P>
<P>
"But the park had nothing to do with it. When I'm right I have a good sinker. 
It's tough on guys trying to hit it into the seats." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' Pedro Guerrero and Todd Zeille hit home runs and teammate Willie 
McGee had three hits and drove in two runs. It was only the Cardinals' fourth 
victory in their last 14 games. DAN HAFNER

L.A. GAMES PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
COACH'S RESIGNATION LEAVES CLEVELAND BASKETBALL TEAM IN A STATE OF UNCERTAINTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of the L. A. Games, the normally ebullient Cleveland High basketball 
players this week appeared burned out, not fired up. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Paez, who replaced Bob Braswell as coach last summer, has resigned, 
leaving the Cavaliers suddenly unsure of themselves. Assistant Bort Escoto will 
coach the team during the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland was in a similar situation last year after Braswell left to become an 
assistant at Cal State Long Beach. Braswell, however, coached the team during 
the 1989 L.A. Games and helped in the selection of Paez. 
</P>
<P>
Paez has severed his ties to the team because of "off-court distractions" and 
"blatant recruiting," and no decision has been made on a permanent replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland is seeded eighth in the 128-team tournament, which will take place 
this weekend and next. The Cavaliers will open against Inglewood at 1 p.m. 
today at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to basketball, L.A. Games events include baseball, football, 
karate, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, water polo, and 
wrestling. In all, the tournament will include more than 10,000 participants. 
Events are open to the public and admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, meanwhile, has been wallowing in confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, nobody really knows what's happening," said Escoto, conceding that 
he is "kind of depressed" about the situation. "It's kind of like a big 
mystery. (The players) just feel abandoned. Last year they had the comforts of 
Coach Braswell, this year they're in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
The players' recent listlessness contrasts vividly with their previous 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids basically do what they have to do and just go home," Escoto said. He 
added that in more stable times, "There was lots of intensity, lots of 
enthusiasm. Kids were feeling good about themselves, like a team getting ready 
to go to war." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland now wars with inexperience. Just four varsity players return: guards 
Brandon Martin, Kenny Collins and Sean Gunther, and forward Kaheed Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard to say how we'll do," Collins said. "We can win if we play 
with our heart. It's going to take hustle and the little things. It's not going 
to really be talent that does it, it's got to be from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
That seems to be a prerequisite for success in other sports as well. Among 
water polo matches, Harvard will play host to Chadwick at 8:30 a.m. Saturday. 
Glendale will open against Damien at 3 p.m. Saturday at Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
In volleyball, Chatsworth, the City Section 4-A Division champion, will play 
Boys Republic; Van Nuys will play Canyon. All volleyball matches will be held 
at North Torrance and will begin Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Royal will play Bell at South Torrance in one of the 32 first-round boys' 
soccer matches. Burroughs will play Don Lugo in a girls' soccer match. Each of 
the eight girls' matches will be played Saturday at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Today's baseball schedule includes L.A. Baptist vs. San Fernando at El Camino 
College, Chatsworth vs. Duarte at Grant, Alemany vs. Bassett at Grant, and 
Grant vs. Sierra Vista at Grant.

CSUN'S CASTRO TO REDSHIRT FOR CROSS-COUNTRY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jorge Castro of Cal State Northridge, a two-time NCAA Division II All-American, 
said Friday that he will redshirt the 1990 cross-country season, CSUN's first 
at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
Castro cited a need to concentrate on schoolwork, find a part-time job, and 
take a break from the rigors of competitive running. He said he also might 
redshirt the 1991 track and field season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my plan right now," said Castro, who placed 11th in last year's 
Division II cross-country championships in Marshalls Creek, Pa. "But I'll have 
to see how the fall semester goes before I make a final decision about track." 
</P>
<P>
Castro, a 1987 graduate of Ramona High, was the No. 2 runner on last year's 
Matador cross-country team that placed fifth in the Division II meet, the 
highest finish by a Northridge men's team since a runner-up finish in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought about (redshirting) for a while, and this just seems like the 
time to do it," said Castro, who placed 26th in the 1987 Division II meet as a 
freshman. "I need a break from running for a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
A disappointing end to his junior track and field season last month played a 
big role in Castro's decision. 
</P>
<P>
After recovering from injuries suffered in an April bicycling accident, Castro 
placed fourth in the 1,500 meters in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championships at UC Riverside, then qualified for the Division II meet with a 
personal best of 3 minutes 49.60 seconds at the Santa Monica Distance Carnival 
a week later. 
</P>
<P>
He contracted a case of bronchitis at nationals, however, and dropped out of 
the 1,500 final. 
</P>
<P>
"That was pretty much the straw that broke the camel's back," Castro said. "It 
seems like every year in track I set (personal records), but it never ends with 
a great race. I'd like that to change."

LORRAINE'S 2-HITTER LIFTS CALIFORNIA ALL-STARS, 7-0

<P>
Andrew Lorraine of Hart High pitched a two-hit shutout Friday to lead a 
California all-star team to its first win in the Sunbelt High School Seniors 
All-Star Baseball Classic, a 7-0 victory over Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
California (1-3) supported Lorraine with an 11-hit attack, including a solo 
home run by Chris Larson of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine struck out 11 and allowed no walks. Maryland's Andrew Sreboski singled 
in the first inning, but was picked off by Lorraine. Bill Dunn doubled in the 
fourth to become Maryland's only other baserunner in the seven-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
California lost twice Thursday, 9-8 to Georgia and 4-3 to Florida. California 
also dropped an 8-6 decision to Ohio on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (3-0) is the only undefeated team in the tournament. Ohio is 3-1, 
Florida 2-1, Oklahoma 2-2 and Maryland 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
California will play two more games today. 
</P>
<P>
"What a relief it was for us," said the 6-foot-3, 190-pound Lorraine. "We've 
been coming up so close. I just knew I had to pull one out." 
</P>
<P>
California's Darvin Traylor of Riverside Poly was three for four with a triple 
and two runs batted in. Damon Lumbi of Burlingame had two doubles and one RBI. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're just as good (as the other teams)," said Lorraine, whose team 
will face Oklahoma today. "The pitching doesn't seem to be as strong as ours, 
yet they come up with the hits." 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine, bound for Stanford, was 9-0 with six saves and an earned-run average 
of 0.91 last season.

Lynn Brader of Somis drove to his first main-event win of the season in the 
Street Stock 15-lap race at Ventura Raceway on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Olsen of Ventura led for six laps before he lost control and fishtailed 
in Turn 4, allowing Brader to overtake him. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen was second and Don Keeter of Ventura finished third and moved into the 
oval track season points lead over Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Garrety of Oxnard also drove to his first main-event win of the season in 
the Mini Stock 20-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Davis of Port Hueneme had led for 13 laps before Garrety overtook him on 
the back straightaway. Marty Desbrow of Ventura finished second and Davis took 
third. 
</P>
<P>
With the aid of a yellow flag, Terry Swauger of Ojai drove to victory in the 
Mini Stock eight-lap figure-eight main event. Russ Warren of Van Nuys had just 
passed Swauger on Lap 5 when Port Hueneme contestant Joe Silva's car caught 
fire to bring out the yellow and put Swauger back on top; he then held on for 
the win. Warren was second and Forrest Nickerson of Santa Paula was third. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's Randy Gens drove to his first victory of the season, leading 
wire-to-wire in the Street Stock six-lap Figure-eight main event. Firsich was 
second and Olsen was third.

TOPPLING WALLS IN A FEARFUL WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: KEITH REDDIN'S NEW PLAY, 'LIFE DURING WARTIME,' TAKES A LOOK AT THE 
MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF SELLING FEAR FOR A LIVING.

<TEXT>
<P>
Little did anyone guess that sweet, ruddy-cheeked Barnaby Tucker, whose biggest 
fantasy was to kiss a girl once before he died in Thornton Wilder's "The 
Matchmaker," was dreaming of war and nuclear destruction on his days off. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1987 when the La Jolla Playhouse cast actor-playwright Keith Reddin 
in the role. 
</P>
<P>
Reddin is no Barnaby Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old has written about such politically charged fare as the Korean 
War ("Life and Limb"), the Cuban missile crisis ("Rum and Coke"), life in the 
United States versus life in the Soviet Union ("Highest Standard of Living") 
and the bankers-traders-dealers ("Big Time.") 
</P>
<P>
Reddin will premiere his latest work, "Life During Wartime," at the La Jolla 
Playhouse from June 24 through July 29 at the Warren Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Reddin made his first indelible impression as a playwright in San Diego when he 
premiered "Nebraska" last year at the La Jolla Playhouse. In that play, Reddin 
took a dark, intense look at what life at the bottom of a missile silo may be 
like for the men who keep watch over the fatal buttons. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a pretty picture, but it was a critically acclaimed one that won 
Reddin an award for the best new play from the San Diego Critics Circle. 
"Nebraska" has just completed a run at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Life During Wartime" tackles another contemporary and, for Reddin, morally 
loaded subject: home security systems. In the play, a young salesman wants to 
make it as a home-security salesman and learns in the process that what he is 
selling is fear. As Reddin put it in a conversation in the Mandell Weiss 
Theatre, the question the salesman tackles is: "How do you protect yourself in 
this world that seems so chaotic without building walls so that you're cut off 
from the entire world?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's about making connections," explained Reddin, who, for the record, does 
not have a home-security system and does not intend to get one. 
</P>
<P>
"He's selling these systems which are about how to keep out a world that's 
violent and crazy. At the same time, he's falling in love and trying to break 
down walls." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a very different play from "Nebraska," Reddin said. Where "Nebraska" 
was realistic, with a claustrophobic air to match the explosive feelings of the 
men in the silos, "Life During Wartime" is fanciful and expansive. There is 
even a scene in which John Calvin, the 16th-Century religious philosopher, 
waltzes in to talk to the audience about free will and original sin. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking theatrical walls is in keeping with the theme of the play, which is 
about building up and breaking down walls between people. Reddin confessed that 
some of the ideas he got for doing this may have come right out of -- of all 
things -- "The Matchmaker," where Wilder, playfully moves his actors from 
within the action of the play to the edge of the stage where they address the 
audience directly. 
</P>
<P>
And then, too, there is an innocence to the young salesman that Reddin -- who 
may be just a little bit Barnaby-like after all -- relates to. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to fall in love and have a family," the still single Reddin said. "I 
don't want to give myself up to paranoia and insecurity and see the world as a 
scary place." 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in New Jersey and attended Northwestern University as an 
undergraduate and studied playwrighting at the Yale Drama School. He would have 
preferred to go into the drama school as an actor, but being afraid that it was 
too hard to go into, he wrote a play. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his first move after graduation was to go to New York, where he became . 
. . an actor. It is in the last six years that he has written a play every 
year. That may seem a big deal to some, but not to Reddin. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I write a lot because I write a play every year," he said with a 
shrug. "It's a couple of months of writing and then a couple of months of 
acting." 
</P>
<P>
His most recent acting stints are in the movies. He has the role of a Rolling 
Stone reporter in Oliver Stone's upcoming film "The Doors," about rock star Jim 
Morrison and that of a Harvard Law student in the film "Reversal of Fortune," a 
story about Claus von Bulow starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. 
</P>
<P>
And the writing continues. 
</P>
<P>
Fluency in Russian, which he studied in college, inspired him to write "Highest 
Standard of Living" and translate "The Russian Teacher," a story about a doctor 
who illegally rents out hospital beds near a seaside resort by Soviet 
playwright Alexander Buravsky. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Repertory Theatre in Costa Mesa will present the premiere of 
"The Russian Teacher" March 12-April 14, 1991, at its Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
Reddin has been produced at America's finest regional theaters including the 
Yale Repertory Theatre, the New York Shakespeare Festival, the American 
Repertory Theatre, the Goodman Theatre as well as the Eugene O'Neill 
Playwrights Conference and American Playhouse. And "Life During Wartime" is 
already scheduled for its next production, at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't take anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you write a new play, it's like the first play and it's judged on 
its own merits," said Reddin. "It never seems to get easier. It's just a matter 
of learning to listen to your own voice and having confidence in what I have to 
say and the way I say it. Finding your voice and your style is something I'm 
still trying to do. I don't have a formula. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like Nebraska was good, but I didn't want to write the same thing in 
'Life During Wartime.' 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make sure that I'm not too comfortable or too safe. I want to dive 
into the world. I want to experience things. This play is about diving in and 
taking chances."

CHER: GLITZ, NOT GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Watching Cher go through her pop-celebrity paces Thursday night at the San 
Diego Sports Arena, one could only wish that she would slip into something a 
little more comfortable -- like an alter ego. 
</P>
<P>
Give Cher a role to play -- the vulnerable nuclear-munitions worker of 
"Silkwood," say, or even a witch of Eastwick -- and she suddenly becomes an 
artist, a conduit for stories and passions. 
</P>
<P>
Singers who treat songs the way committed actors treat their characters can be 
conduits, too. But in a lazy hour on stage, some of which she spent singing, 
Cher was interested only in spotlighting what's least substantial about 
herself: herself. Or at least that side of herself that is bound up in being a 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Cher's concert was so much like a testimonial that rubber chicken should have 
been served. It began with a five-minute, this-is-your-life video sequence that 
ranged from her baby photos to her acceptance speech for the 1988 best-actress 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-set came more video history, this time chronicling her partnership with 
former husband Sonny Bono (dispensing with all the Sonny &amp; Cher hits via 
old footage saved Cher the trouble of having to sing any of them live). And, 
with the video screen lowering yet a third time, we got to see a montage of 
clips from Cher's acting career. 
</P>
<P>
Cher made a teasing joke early on about doing her concert "naked." For all the 
well-toned flesh she showed as she changed from outfit to skimpy outfit (there 
were eight costume changes in all, or was it nine?), Cher had a screen to guard 
her -- the image-making TV screen to which she owes her stardom. 
</P>
<P>
Cher seldom dared to stand naked in a more meaningful sense, with only her 
emotive resources and the quality of her songs to carry the performance. In one 
of the most annoyingly cluttered uses of choreography this side of David 
Bowie's overblown 1987 "Glass Spider" tour, Cher was surrounded by seven 
dancers who rushed and swung about a scaffolded set that resembled the 
backstage rigging of a theater. 
</P>
<P>
Like the video screen, the dancers served Cher as a convenient, labor-saving 
crutch. With all that motion around her, she could afford to move at a walk. 
Consequently, she never broke a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
Cher isn't without talent as a singer. Until her voice began to fray toward the 
end, her deep, melodramatic belting sounded full-bodied compared to the girlish 
tones in vogue on the pop charts since Madonna hit the scene. It's the way Cher 
uses her voice that is so inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to delve into a song, changing the dynamics, shading tones -- 
doing the things that good singers do to communicate feeling -- Cher just kept 
belting. Exaggeration and melodrama are as much a part of her celebrity persona 
as her revealing outfits. 
</P>
<P>
Cher sang six songs from the 1987 and 1989 albums that marked her successful 
pop comeback after five years of building her acting career. These were slight, 
cliched affairs ideally suited to her bombast. The rest of the 12-song set 
consisted of unimaginative covers of such familiar material as Bruce 
Springsteen's "Tougher Than the Rest," the Eagles' "Take It to the Limit" and 
Bob Seger's "Fire Down Below." 
</P>
<P>
The best of the lot was a spunky, show-opening version of "I'm No Angel," by 
Cher's ex-husband Gregg Allman (their teen-age son, Elijah, was a shy rhythm 
guitarist among his mom's 10-member crew of players and singers, which also 
included Darlene Love, the lead voice of several early-'60s Phil Spector hits). 
Cher appeared at the start in a relatively demure pinkish pants outfit, giving 
rise to fleeting hopes that she might be putting the focus on music rather than 
image. The parade of lingerie and other glitz began soon after. 
</P>
<P>
The show's low point was a shrill, heavy-handed attempt at Jimmy Cliff's 
eloquent soul-gospel song "Many Rivers to Cross." The least intimate of 
singers, Cher utterly failed to convey the sense of inner meditation that gives 
the song much of its power. 
</P>
<P>
Cher did have an engagingly offhand way of addressing her fans, calling them 
"guys" and treating them like old pals. But her performance seldom put a charge 
into the crowd. Tellingly, some of the most enthusiastic applause greeted 
scenes on the video screen -- especially the clips from Cher's film career -- 
instead of the live performance unfolding on stage.

FACES . . . : A DARKER CAPT. HOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Captain Hook, that shiny meat hook of a hand slashing through the air, has 
always been a child's bedtime villain, good for a little nightmare for the tots 
but really a figure of innocent squealish delight for children raised on Darth 
Vader. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes actor Stephen Hanan, co-starring with Cathy Rigby in "Peter Pan" at 
the Pantages, who turns theater's most popular, dastardly pirate into a 
menacing psychotic. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept going into this show," said Broadway veteran Hanan, "was to play 
Hook more darkly, to catch the lighter side of evil and capture his cavernous 
abysses of grief and heartbreak. He wants revenge for his childhood. Hook was 
Barrie's critique of the British class system, which is all in Barrie's novel 
(1911). Hook is the nightmare version of the children's Daddy" (Mr. Darling, 
whom Hanan also plays in a double role). 
</P>
<P>
The show is a hard ticket here, closing at the Pantages July 1 and continuing 
on tour through the country until it winds up on Broadway in December. 
</P>
<P>
Hanan, 43, a classically trained actor from Washington who was Tony-nominated 
for his work in "Cats," broke into theater singing Italian arias for money 
outside the San Francisco Ferry Terminal between 1971 and 1977. "It was the era 
of Woodstock, and I had just come back from a year on a Fulbright Fellowship in 
London, where my training ) had made me very idealistic about theater. My agent 
would only send me out for commercials, so I became a full-tilt hippie." 
</P>
<P>
He's written a play about that period, about Haight-Asbury, entitled "Rainbow's 
Return," which was produced last year in Hampton, N.Y. In fact, Hanan has 
written five plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I act to support my writing habit," he said with a grin. RAY LOYND

THE ECONOMICS OF DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To paraphrase Lewis Segal's June 18 review of Pacific Dance Ensemble, it seems 
to me he has a lot to answer for. 
</P>
<P>
The tenor of all of Segal's coverage of Generator Eight has indicated a serious 
misunderstanding of the economics of producing dance in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
If dance companies didn't self-produce or create cooperative ventures like 
Generator Eight, there would be very little new and risky dance in Los Angeles 
for him to criticize. Moreover, his continual focus on the "controversy" around 
Generator Eight implies that he would rather people such as Danielle Shapiro 
didn't try to produce dance if their efforts generate anything less than a 
supportive reaction within the dance community. 
</P>
<P>
What he doesn't seem to realize is that his perpetually negative slant on 
issues like this is far more divisive and damaging to the dance community than 
taking the risks and producing a festival that brings 2,500 people to downtown 
Los Angeles to see and enjoy eight stimulating evenings of dance.

AN EXCESS OF CRAFTSMANSHIP IN 'MOSAICS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Art of Mosaics: Selections From the Gilbert Collection," an exhibition of 
19th-Century Roman and Florentine decorative arts at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art, illuminates two little-known schools of virtuoso craftsmanship 
-- and demonstrates what can go wrong when technical wizardry outstrips 
aesthetic content. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 18th Century, the frescoes in St. Peter's had 
deteriorated so badly that they had to be replaced with more durable mosaics. 
The artisans in the Vatican workshops refined their techniques until they could 
fit up to 1,400 tesserae, or fragments of spun glass, into a square inch of 
surface. (Their workmanship was so subtle that many visitors to St. Peter's 
don't realize they're looking at mosaics rather than paintings.) 
</P>
<P>
After the restorations in St. Peter's had been completed, the artisans began 
decorating table tops, cabinets, coffers and jewelry with scenes of Italy and 
images copied from ancient mosaics and Renaissance paintings. The Victorian 
upper classes loved anything that smacked of classical antiquity, and furniture 
set with Roman mosaics soon became a favorite, if pricey, souvenir for visiting 
Russian czars and wealthy English milords. 
</P>
<P>
The furniture and jewelry in the exhibition constitute a tour de force of 
craftsmanship. Necklace medallions are set with delicate micromosaics that 
resemble petit point embroidery. Table tops inlaid with elaborate garlands of 
fruit and flowers rival the finest 18th-Century marquetry. 
</P>
<P>
The large mosaic panels that suggest ersatz paintings are considerably less 
successful. It reportedly took Gioacchino Rinaldi more than five years to 
complete his 5-foot landscape, "The Ruins of Paestrum," but the labor needed to 
assemble those millions of bits of glass overwhelm its artistic content. The 
viewer looks at it and thinks, "Well, he lived to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
The Florentine mosaics represent a different tradition that dates to the late 
16th Century. Rather than fuss with tiny shards of glass, the craftsmen in the 
Medici workshops cut semi-precious stones into intricate pieces and fit them 
together like an opulent jigsaw puzzles. The resulting pietre dure, or 
hard-stone mosaics, recall the small figurines that the Faberge artisans made 
from the same materials: agate, onyx, colored marble, obsidian, quartz, jasper. 
</P>
<P>
The Florentine mosaics are also most effective as decorations. The panels of 
landscapes with ruins set in an 18th-Century English cabinet suggest miniature 
Tiffany windows. The mottled colors of the stone evoke a cloudy sky or the 
leafy crown of a tree, the way Tiffany's elaborately textured glass does. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the attempts to use pietre dure techniques to simulate paintings 
veer perilously close to kitsch. "Two Little Tykes," a self-conscious study of 
a small boy and his dog by Mario Montelatici, looks like an early-day Saturday 
Evening Post cover. 
</P>
<P>
No antique buff or student of the decorative arts should miss "The Art of 
Mosaics," which remains on display indefinitely. Like Faberge eggs, these 
tables and necklaces are products of a time when skilled labor was cheap and an 
apprentice artisan might spend a decade or more learning the secrets of his 
craft. No one could duplicate these pieces today, even with the most 
sophisticated computer technology.

"Kid Dinosaur," at the Rose Theatre in Venice, is a high-spirited musical 
fantasy that plays like a rough draft. 
</P>
<P>
Director/writer Jim Houle uses three comic dinosaur characters to get young 
audiences to tune in to two messages -- believe in yourself and protect the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Tyranna (Pat Loeb) is under the spell of evil pterodactyl Tyrell (Earl 
Groom Jr.), who has polluted the dinosaur kingdom for the sake of industrial 
progress. Enter Kid Dinosaur (Monica McMurtry) and Max (R.J. Wagner), a 
supposed member of the audience, to thwart Tyrell's schemes and clean up the 
kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
The music, by Amy Wooley and Adam Wilner, is often catchy, and the clever 
costumes, with foam construction by Cleve Hall, are impressive. The cast 
provides engaging moments: Groom does a vivid comic turn as the meanie and 
delivers rap lyrics with panache, while McMurtry bounces around with appealing, 
youthful zest. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Houle's plot nor his direction plays smoothly. He requires the 
somewhat unpolished cast to address the audience throughout, and that's tricky 
business. Nothing is more awkward in children's theater than actors who are 
uncomfortable talking to children and lose their timing doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Some judicious rethinking could turn "Kid Dinosaur's" likable moments into a 
likable play.

STAKES RISE FOR ALL PLAYERS IN MIDEAST GAME OF PEACE

<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization has found itself abruptly dealt out of a 
poker game that it had only recently sat down to play. Now, a variety of 
diplomats and analysts say, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat faces the task of 
convincing the world that he still has control of his own hand: a deeply 
divided cadre of militants who have grown increasingly restless playing 
Arafat's version of moderation. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they said, the U.S. decision this week to suspend its 
18-month-old dialogue with the PLO leaves the Middle East open to more 
dangerous players and may place even more pressure on Israel to produce results 
in a game in which it is suddenly setting the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened is we've cut out a lot of the middle ground," said one analyst 
close to the peace negotiations. "The moderates are the ones that lost the most 
in the last 24 hours, and there isn't a lot of room in the field to play right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Arguing behind closed doors in Baghdad, Iraq, for more than 24 hours, the PLO 
executive committee finally emerged late Thursday with a response to suspension 
of the dialogue. That response offered, as a token to the moderates, an 
investigation of the May 30 raid on Israeli beaches by a Palestinian faction, 
and, to satisfy radicals increasingly disenchanted with Arafat's policy of 
moderation, five pages of bitter rebukes directed at Israel and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's very difficult for Arafat," said one Middle East analyst. 
"He's either got to admit he doesn't control some of his own elements, which he 
doesn't, or he's got to condemn one of his own elements, which again would be 
hard to do. Anyone who thinks Arafat really can control every faction of the 
PLO really is living in a very unrealistic world." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in their demand that the PLO condemn the speedboat raid by the Palestine 
Liberation Front, a faction of the PLO, and expel its leader, Abul Abbas, from 
the PLO Executive Committee, U.S. officials have indicated that they want more 
than a renewed vow that the PLO has given up terrorism: They want assurances 
that, when they sit down in any dialogue with Arafat, they are talking to the 
PLO -- all of it. 
</P>
<P>
With the Palestinian community spread among the 1.7 million Palestinians living 
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and 3.5 million more in cities 
and refugee camps all over the Arab world, among guerrilla groups in Lebanon 
and militant Palestinian factions in Damascus, that expectation may be hard to 
live up to, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials believe the U.S. decision to cut off direct contacts with 
the PLO leadership won't help Arafat consolidate his grip on the organization. 
Quite the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
"The moderates among the Palestinians are losing their credibility, and if they 
lose their credibility, there will be no moderation between Arabs and Israel," 
said Tahseen Basheer, a former diplomat and government analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt sees the only hope for (keeping) the Middle East from entering into a 
blind alley of despair is through moderation," he said. "We understand the 
frustration. We are also frustrated. But we shouldn't allow frustration to take 
the best of us. We are trying to maintain some sanity in a process which, if 
left to slide, will slide into blind, black despair." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, no one is ruling out the possibility that Egypt, which in recent 
months has acted as an intermediary to help set up a direct dialogue between 
Palestinians and Israelis in Cairo, could temporarily step in and take on the 
U.S. role to maintain some forward momentum in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, a dialogue with the U.S. enhances the possibility of success, but 
the peace process itself can still take place -- it's not totally dependent on 
a U.S.-PLO dialogue," said one official. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to sources close to the talks, the U.S. dialogue with the 
PLO never was used as a vehicle for negotiating critical points of diplomacy -- 
to the Palestinians' chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the three formal sessions and more than 40 informal contacts between 
the PLO and the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., were 
primarily designed by the United States to open lines of communication and 
resolve a variety of minor points that could have become major stumbling blocks 
to the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
PLO officials wanted more: They wanted to talk immediately about convening an 
international conference on peace in the Middle East, a definition of 
self-determination for the Palestinians and official recognition of the PLO as 
the representative of the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a feeling within the PLO that the U.S. did not live up to its 
commitment to have a substantive dialogue with the PLO," Jamil Hilal, head of 
the PLO information department, said in a recent interview in Tunis. 
</P>
<P>
The United States felt it was "unrealistic" to take on such major issues at a 
time when the two sides were only beginning to get to know each other, Western 
observers of the talks said, and instead attempted to "create an atmosphere 
that might sustain negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
And so U.S. and Palestinian representatives started by discussing more 
particular points -- the level of violence in the occupied territories and 
cross-border raids undertaken by PLO operatives -- with some levels of success. 
Some officials credit the dialogue with preventing Arafat's recent talk of 
seeking a visa to address the United Nations in New York -- a request that 
would have ignited a political firestorm for the State Department -- from ever 
coming to a boil. For all the PLO's posturing, no official visa application was 
ever made. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's documentable that there was a vastly reduced number of what some 
might say were terrorist actions against Israel when the dialogue was taking 
place, inside and outside the territories, and one could sense the leadership 
was really trying to hold down the level of violence from within," said one 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the subject of elections of Palestinian leaders in the occupied 
territories emerged as a point of discussion, and when Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak last summer proposed a plan for brokering discussions of the elections, 
the focus of the U.S.-PLO dialogue moved from Tunis to Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the PLO was frustrated, especially since its role in the negotiations 
was limited to whispering in the ear of the Egyptians. 
</P>
<P>
"What they (the U.S.) did was to downgrade the dialogue with the PLO by 
creating a second channel through the Egyptians," Hilal complained. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Egyptians are now able to pick up where the United States 
officially left off, no one is expecting any progress in peace talks until 
Israel's new hard-line government makes the first move. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, many analysts expect the suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue will 
put even more pressure on Israel to make progress for peace: to put up or shut 
up, now that it has got what it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"There are fewer reasons now for Israel not to engage," said one analyst. "And 
the same is true for the Americans. Having an ongoing peace process allowed 
them to dodge a whole lot of bullets. Without a peace process now, without a 
dialogue, they're going to have to confront each and every issue as it goes by. 
They can't fall back on a peace process. They can't fall back on a dialogue. So 
the Israelis are really exposed." 
</P>
<P>
There have been reports this week that Israel's new defense minister, Moshe 
Arens, will try to open talks with West Bank Palestinian leaders, including 
Faisal Husseini and Sari Nusseibeh, both of whom are closely identified with 
the PLO. The talks would outline temporary means of reducing tensions in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip as a prelude to negotiations over the final status of 
the territories, which the Shamir-led government believes should remain in 
Israel's control. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the United States now faces a dilemma with Israel in any 
discussion about resuming talks with the Palestinians. Israel has made it clear 
it believes the dialogue suspension should be permanent. What kind of reward 
would it be to restart the talks just as Israel begins making independent 
progress toward peace? 
</P>
<P>
"It's rather difficult, if they are forthcoming, to sort of punish them by 
starting the talks again," said Andrew Duncan, a Middle East specialist with 
London's International Institute for Strategic Studies. "At the same time, 
starting the talks again would be helpful in getting things rolling once the 
Israelis unblock it. . . . The Israelis, of course, can't have it both ways."

CANADA'S CONSTITUTIONAL ACCORD DIES IN PROVINCE 
</P>

<P>
A controversial package of amendments to the Canadian constitution that would 
have given special status to Quebec died in the Newfoundland provincial 
legislature here Friday. The failure is likely to lead to a serious testing of 
the bonds between English and French Canada in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad day for Canada," said an exhausted-looking Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney as he left his offices in Ottawa late Friday evening. "It's obviously 
a sad day for me as prime minister, but I'm particularly thinking about the 
youth of Canada." 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney has long been warning Canadians that if they rejected the 
constitutional amendments, Quebec would take it as a rejection of French 
Canadians in general. He declined to make extensive remarks Friday, and is 
scheduled to make a formal address today. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown came when Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells abruptly canceled a 
scheduled vote in the legislature on whether to ratify the amendments. A short 
time later, Lowell Murray, a member of the national Senate who has been acting 
as Prime Minister Mulroney's point man in the ratification battle, pronounced a 
death notice on the process. 
</P>
<P>
Wells' action "has dashed the one remaining hope to have (the amendments) 
succeed," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have accepted Mulroney's contention that Quebec's political 
leaders may now feel compelled to begin finding ways of separating their 
province from the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Parizeau, leader of the nationalist opposition Parti Quebecois said, 
"We are in a situation tonight where . . . Canada is saying no to Quebec." 
</P>
<P>
The constitutional amendments, which had to be accepted by all 10 Canadian 
provinces to become effective, would have recognized Quebec as a "distinct 
society" within Canada, with a special duty to preserve its different language, 
culture and historical roots. The so-called "distinct society clause" was one 
of the most controversial and confusing elements of the constitutional 
amendments, which would also have have altered the federal-provincial power 
relationship in such areas as spending and immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
Many English-speaking Canadians worried that since the words distinct society 
could be defined in different ways by different people, Quebec might come up 
with radical interpretations and use the special status to enact laws offensive 
to the rest of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, reacting to the news from Newfoundland, said, 
"English Canada must understand that Quebec is today, and has always been, a 
distinct society, free and able to assume control of its destiny." He, too, is 
expected to make a more detailed address on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In a turbulent session of the Newfoundland legislature, opposition leader Tom 
Rideout denounced Wells, saying the premier's action killed the amendments 
without the dignity of a vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you afraid (they) might pass?" he shouted across the green-carpeted room 
at Wells as his fellow Progressive Conservatives thumped their benches in 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
But Wells was just as angry and adamant in his lengthy speech Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Meech Lake Accord is wrong for the long-term future of Canada and wrong 
for the long-term future of this province," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians call the amendment package the Meech Lake Accord because it was 
drafted at a retreat center on the shores of Meech Lake, in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Wells' surprise move Friday evening came in response to an equally surprising 
proposal earlier in the day by the federal government to extend the deadline 
for ratification. For months, the government has been saying categorically that 
the deadline would fall on June 23 -- today -- and that no extension could be 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
For the government to come up with a way of rolling back the deadline now, one 
day before it fell due, clearly enraged Wells. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried our best, Mr. Speaker, to be accommodating, to turn the other 
cheek. But we're running out of other cheeks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Wells' speech, Conservatives shouted their objections from across 
the room, forcing Wells to call repeatedly on the Speaker to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
Wells was angered because he had asked the federal government for an extension 
more than a week ago, so that he could put the constitutional amendments to a 
public referendum in his province. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the federal officials refused, probably assuming that 
Newfoundland voters, given such an opportunity, would kill the amendments. 
Newfoundland is far poorer than Quebec, and people here feel that Quebec is a 
major cause of their plight, having fleeced them badly in a 65-year contract 
for a huge, joint hydro-electric power project. They resent the idea of giving 
their neighboring province any special privileges. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Wells had said he accepted the federal government's position and 
would do the next best thing to holding a referendum: He said he would let his 
legislature vote on the issue instead. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Newfoundland legislature have said since then that the vote 
would be the biggest and most difficult decision of their political careers. 
Many have agonized publicly about not being able to make up their minds, 
fearful that a wrong vote might be the undoing of a stable, prosperous country. 
</P>
<P>
But while they set about canvassing their constituents in preparation for the 
vote, the amendments got bogged down in the prairie province of Manitoba, the 
only other province that has not ratified them. There, the lone Indian member 
of the legislature mounted an effective and wildly popular procedural battle 
against ratification. The Manitoba legislature adjourned Friday without any 
vote in prospect. 
</P>
<P>
It was Manitoba's stalling, with the clock running down, that finally prompted 
the government to eat its past words and admit that there might be a way of 
extending the ratification deadline after all. 
</P>
<P>
At midday Friday, Murray had announced that it was "not necessarily fatal" if 
Manitoba missed the deadline. He said that if Newfoundland voted to ratify the 
amendments Friday afternoon, then the federal government would ask the Supreme 
Court to "clarify" the body of law on constitutional amendments, and see 
whether today really had to be the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
It was a desperate gesture that would only work if Quebec were willing to play 
along -- a big if. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Murray said, "everything depends on the free vote" of the 
Newfoundland legislature. He explained that the government would grant the 
extension to Manitoba only if Newfoundland first voted to ratify the 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's words, coming just hours before Newfoundland was scheduled to vote, 
may have been intended to pressure the legislators to ratify. But if so, the 
gambit backfired, since Newfoundlanders were already feeling too pressured. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Wells disclosed that he had been trying all morning to get 
Murray on the phone, to discuss the imminent vote with him. Instead of 
returning his calls, Wells said, Murray had gone on live, national television 
to put Newfoundland on the spot, casting the anguished province as a potential 
spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the final manipulation," said Wells. "We're not prepared to be 
manipulated any longer."

VERBAL CLASH SYMBOLIZES DIVISIONS IN AIDS STRUGGLE 
</P>

<P>
AIDS patient advocates and traditional medical representatives clashed here 
Friday over results of controversial new treatments, with the leader of an 
underground drug-testing program announcing "powerful" new findings and the 
editor of a prestigious medical journal denouncing him for practicing "black 
magic." 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation came at a panel discussion on the third day of the 
International Conference on AIDS after Martin Delaney, head of unsanctioned 
experiments organized by his San Francisco-based Project Inform, released 
sketchy data purporting to show improvements in some AIDS patients who received 
the drug, Compound Q. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, a symbol of 
the medical establishment to many AIDS activists, chastised Delaney's findings 
and, more generally, took issue with patients' efforts to disseminate 
information on potential treatments such as Compound Q. 
</P>
<P>
"If (inaccurate information) gets out without being reviewed by unbiased 
experts and gets acted upon, it leads to a lot of bad possibilities," Relman 
said. "Money is wasted, time is wasted. . . . There is great initial 
enthusiasm, and then despondency, pessimism and despair." 
</P>
<P>
The clash provided a graphic metaphor for a contentious and crucial debate 
between the two main camps in the struggle to contain -- and, it is hoped, 
eventually conquer -- the AIDS virus: patient advocates who seek rapid answers 
and progress through experimental treatments, and established medical 
researchers who are wedded to painstaking scientific methods. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, AIDS patients and activists are growing impatient with the 
deliberate pace of medical research into the disease and are demanding 
widespread use of experimental drugs they believe could hold the key to 
overcoming AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
As Delaney noted Friday, debates about clinical trials are "more than academic 
discussions. For many members of my community, they are life and death 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
The debate inside Moscone Center was a more restrained version of the raucous 
confrontations outside where activists from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power 
(ACT UP) have been demanding new, quicker research methods in an attempt to 
speed life-saving drugs to patients. 
</P>
<P>
ACT UP/New York, for example, issued a treatment research agenda this week 
listing 60 antiviral drugs, nine immune-system enhancers, 20 anti-infectives 
and 12 other AIDS drugs that the group said should enter clinical trials in 
1990 or 1991 based on favorable test-tube data. 
</P>
<P>
ACT UP also called for the immediate release of seven drugs that have been 
tested extensively and urged that another dozen be considered for release on 
the "parallel track." The parallel track, pioneered last year with the 
antiviral DDI, allows patients access to a drug while it is being studied for 
efficacy. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the meeting hall, Relman admonished Delaney, saying "there is no way on 
earth for anyone to interpret" the sketchy information Delaney presented. 
"Report your data fully to a responsible scientific body or medical journal," 
he advised. "Let's proceed in an orderly, rational, scientific way." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference outside the center later, AIDS sufferer Joel Thomas 
offered a counterpoint to Relman's argument. He said his failing health had 
been turned around by six infusions of Compound Q, a Chinese drug purified from 
the root tubers of a cucumber-like plant known as Trichosanthes kirilowii. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas asked Relman if he would try Compound Q should he be diagnosed with AIDS 
and failing on standard therapies. 
</P>
<P>
"I would probably do the same thing," Relman conceded. 
</P>
<P>
In releasing his finding on Compound Q, Delaney said his optimism was based 
upon improvements in the mean counts of Helper T cells, key sentinels of the 
immune system, the destruction of which is a hallmark of AIDS, in 46 patients 
after they were infused with drug. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "this is a very dangerous drug" and added that it is too 
early for patients to make a treatment decision based upon available data. At 
least one patient died during the underground trial. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the risk of Compound Q was another study authored by Dr. Larry 
Waites and co-authored by Delaney. The study, which will be presented at the 
conference today reported that 6 of 16 patients developed dementia between 36 
and 60 hours after infusion, and two progressed to comas. The neurological 
problems were reversed with the administration of the drug decadron. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese drug Compound Q -- and its American counterpart, GLQ223, made by a 
Redwood City, Calif.-based company called Genelabs -- have been mired in 
controversy since Dr. Michael McGrath published a paper in April, 1989, 
reporting that GLQ223 killed certain cells infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus in test-tube experiments. 
</P>
<P>
However, at least five other laboratories, using various viral strains and 
different culturing and assaying techniques, have been unable to demonstrate 
antiviral activity. McGrath, a UC San Francisco researcher said in a 
presentation here that he believes he succeeded where others failed because he 
performed his experiment in Teflon vessels rather than the plastic dishes 
typically used by researchers. McGrath said the Teflon test-tubes best 
approximate conditions in the human body, though other researchers remain 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of different assay systems and it is an awfully complex 
situation," said Jeffrey Lifson, Genelabs vice president for research. "The 
ultimately bio-assay is going to be the patients." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from UC San Francisco today will report the first patient data from 
their Phase 1 safety trial of GLQ223. Their preliminary findings showed no 
significant change of HIV infection but that the drug warranted further study. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 18 patients, especially those receiving higher doses, had flu-like 
side effects.

International rescue and medical teams poured into the Iranian capital Friday 
as rescue workers and dazed survivors struggled to dig thousands of dead and 
injured from the rubble of the devastatingly powerful earthquake in northwest 
Iran and the official death toll rose to nearly 29,000 -- the highest for an 
earthquake in 14 years.

A dozen towns and hundreds of villages were devastated by the temblor that

early Thursday. The Red Cross in Geneva, quoting the Iranian Red Crescent 
Society, said about 400,000 people are believed homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Friday that the 
known dead number 28,950. It said 25,241 bodies have been counted in Gilan 
province, on the Caspian Sea, and 3,709 in Zanjan province. That toll surpasses 
the 25,000 killed in Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and is the highest known 
worldwide since July, 1976, when an earthquake in China reportedly killed 
242,000. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Geneva said it was told by the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry that the death toll is expected to reach 35,000, with 105,000 
people injured. A total of 28,198 people were injured in the two provinces, 
IRNA said. 
</P>
<P>
More shocks followed the big quake. Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri said a 
main road in the disaster zone, cleared Thursday, was blocked by a fresh 
landslide Friday, wire services reported. 
</P>
<P>
President Hashemi Rafsanjani visited the hardest-hit area, including the town 
of Roudbar in the Caspian province of Gilan. He said "nothing worth mentioning" 
was left of towns and villages he saw during a helicopter flight over the quake 
zone. Gilan province and adjoining Zanjan have a population of about 4 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Iran, proud of its self-reliance since Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini's 1979 Islamic Revolution, would accept foreign help for 
quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
"The catastrophe is so serious . . . " Rafsanjani told IRNA. "International 
help is needed. We should accept the help that is offered." 
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian authorities appeared to vacillate Friday between welcoming the 
outside help -- including representatives from countries with which Iran has a 
hostile relationship -- and rejecting it as unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Four of Iran's bitter enemies -- the United States, Israel, Iraq and Saudi 
Arabia -- sent offers to help. In Washington, State Department officials said 
the U.S. government is donating about $300,000 worth of supplies to the 
American Red Cross for shipment. 
</P>
<P>
The first team to arrive in Tehran from the international medical relief 
organization, Medicins du Monde, was blocked from entering the main earthquake 
area by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest fear is that we will not be allowed to work," said Dr. Jean 
Porrini, leader of the 12-person unit that included a surgical team. "We are 
getting very contradictory information from the ground. The first team we sent 
in was apparently blocked." 
</P>
<P>
Disaster specialists from France, Switzerland, Belgium and Britain arrived late 
Friday night on commercial flights and special charters. They carried equipment 
ranging from a complete field surgical theater to satellite communication 
discs. Several arrived with dogs specially trained to sniff through rubble for 
the trapped victims. 
</P>
<P>
Some rescuers such as a 17-member International Rescue Corps of Marlow, 
England, brought sophisticated heat-sensing and sound detection equipment that 
the Iranians do not have. 
</P>
<P>
The International Rescue Corps team from England brought its own satellite 
transmission system after encountering serious communication problems working 
in Armenia during the earthquake there last year. However, although they were 
sponsored on the trip to Iran by an agency of the United Nations, team leader 
Bryan Kirby said Friday he was not sure the group would be allowed to set up in 
Iranian territory. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to work tonight if they would let us," said Kirby, "but we 
haven't been able to get any reliable information. We have casualty estimates 
of from 1,000 to 37,000 dead over a wide area of Iran." 
</P>
<P>
One crowded commercial flight to the Iranian capital from Paris was filled with 
worried Iranians hoping to find their families. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting in my hotel room in Paris and saw the home where I was born 
completely destroyed," said one Iranian man. "I was horrified, but what could I 
do?" 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said the greatest need is for heavy equipment -- especially cranes 
to lift huge pieces of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Iran told the Swiss-based League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies that 
it needs medicine, tents, blankets, food, trucks, cranes and bulldozers. It 
said it does not need doctors and other experts or blood supplies, sniffer dogs 
or used clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian television showed doctors tending victims on stretchers in a makeshift 
hospital in a parking lot. Masked rescuers in white aprons pulled dust-covered 
bodies from under concrete slabs. Corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Television showed scenes of devastation, including the remains of an entire row 
of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims. They gently 
fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of stones and earth, only his 
head protruding. 
</P>
<P>
At Manjil in Gilan province, Parvin Nemati clutched the headless body of one 
daughter wrapped in a blanket. Her husband and relief workers unearthed the 
body of another daughter, 10-year-old Fatemeh, an Iranian correspondent 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
A man in Roudbar told Iranian television "a rock as big as a building" crashed 
into his home, killing four of his six children. His wife said she lay in the 
ruins for hours with one of the surviving children beside her. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a single house in this area which has been left standing," farmer 
Ali Mohammadi said in Roudbar. 
</P>
<P>
Television showed villagers looking at houses turned into heaps of mud bricks 
and wooden beams by the quake, which was measured at a magnitude of 7.3 by 
Tehran University; the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., put it at 7.7. 
</P>
<P>
Farhad Shad, a spokesman for the Geophysics Center at Tehran University, told 
IRNA that 140 aftershocks were registered after the main temblor. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals overflowed with victims. Tehran Radio said some of the injured were 
flown 600 miles from the disaster zone for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
At the large Khomeini Hospital south of Tehran, a continuous line of ambulances 
drew up to the doors bearing victims from the earthquake. Doctors at the 
hospital said most of the victims suffered crushed bones and head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A young mother hovered over her pale 4-month old baby. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby was asleep with my husband when the earthquake started. I grabbed him 
and started to run outside, but a wall fell on us and crushed his head," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The attending doctor said the young baby girl, Nadia, had suffered multiple 
fractures of her skull and that her intelligence would probably be impaired as 
a result. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the hospital's physicians had been dispatched to the earthquake 
area itself. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran airport was thronged with people trying to reach the quake zone to learn 
the fate of relatives. Officials turned them back, saying the planes were 
needed for relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
This report was supplemented with reports from Times wire services.

U.S. HAS KEY ROLE AT GLOBAL TALKS

<P>
When environmental ministers arrive here next week to wrap up a major 
conference on protecting the ozone layer, none will have more work cut out for 
them than William K. Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly, chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, may well become the 
focus of attention -- and the court of last resort -- for many countries here 
who are urging the United States to change its position on a number of problems 
that have threatened the harmony of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are major amendments to a three-year-old international accord to 
protect the Earth's ozone layer from being stripped away by man-made chemicals. 
The existing accord, known as the Montreal Protocol, calls for a 50% phase-out 
of those chemicals in industrialized countries by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
There is wide agreement that these steps are half-hearted and that there must 
be a 100% phase-out by the year 2000 -- perhaps as soon as 1997 -- of chemicals 
already covered by the protocol. Further, new chemicals not now controlled must 
be covered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons. CFCs are used 
as cooling agents in air conditioners and refrigerators, as blowing agents in 
the manufacturer of foam, and as cleaning agents for electronic components. 
Halons are used in fire extinguishers. 
</P>
<P>
Over a period of time, they percolate into the stratosphere and are broken down 
by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. This releases a chlorine atom, which in 
turn devours up to 100,000 ozone atoms. That is the chemical reaction that is 
drilling a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica and is thinning the layer 
over the North Pole and over North America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On these issues there is little disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
The rub comes in establishing a new executive committee of 15 to dispense about 
$240 million in funds to help Third World countries afford the more expensive 
chemical substitutes for CFCs and halons that do less harm to the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting on the banks of the Thames across from Parliament, lower-ranking 
delegates from 75 nations have been laboring since Wednesday to lay the 
groundwork for these changes and to reach a consensus to present to the 
environmental ministers next week. 
</P>
<P>
But in the first three days of the working sessions, the United States has 
found itself largely isolated by its insistence that it be awarded a permanent 
seat on the new executive committee and that nations contributing the most 
money to the fund be given more votes on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has stirred indignation from Third World countries -- the so-called 
Group of 77 -- because it is the executive committee that will decide which 
developing nations receive funds and how they will be used. The U.S. proposal 
was a "bombshell," in the words of India's delegate, Mahesh Prasad, secretary 
of the Ministry of Environment. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, China urged the United States to "radically" alter course, strongly 
hinting that if the American position won out, China -- with 20% of the world's 
population and a tremendous potential to help or hinder the cause of ozone 
protection -- would refuse to sign the protocol. 
</P>
<P>
Third World countries are holding out for equal representation on the committee 
along the lines called for by Mostafa K. Tolba, executive director of the 
United Nations Environment Program, which is sponsoring the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Tolba has called for a 15-member committee made up of seven representatives 
from Third World countries and seven from industrialized nations. They, in 
turn, would elect a chairman, who would become the 15th member. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What the Americans Want 
</P>
<P>
American delegates have been instructed by Washington to hold fast to that 
position on grounds that the United States would be contributing 25% of the 
fund -- more than any other country. Japan would be second, contributing 11 
1/2%. "That does not seem unreasonable," an EPA aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also wants to be given credit against its 25% share if it 
sends foreign aid directly to another country to help it switch to more 
desirable chemical substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
But, in an interview, Prasad of India said a committee controlled by the 
industrialized West may make mistakes in allocating the funds and specifying 
ways they are to be used. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly will also hear arguments, dealing with issues not of procedure but of 
trust and national sovereignty, delegates from the Third World say. Reilly is 
scheduled to meet with President Bush on Monday before arriving here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While nothing has been said in London about the Third World countries voting as 
a bloc to deny the two-thirds vote required for approving amendments to 
strengthen the protocol, a number of delegates, including one from Britain, 
said that the veto is in the back of everyone's mind. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, it is unclear whether Reilly will bring with him additional 
authority to negotiate. But Washington is getting daily diplomatic reports on 
the sentiment here. 
</P>
<P>
What Washington is being told is that it may once again be alone on an 
environmental issue of global significance, just as it was until last week, 
when it changed its position and belatedly agreed to contribute money to the 
proposed $240-million ozone depletion fund to assist Third World nations in 
joining the fight to close the ozone hole.

SOVIETS SHIFT A-ARMS FROM TENSE REGIONS

The Soviet Union is moving some nuclear warheads from the Baltic states and 
other regions where nationalist tensions have flared to the more stable Russian 
republic, Bush Administration officials and private experts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the prudent thing to do," said an Administration official, noting that 
upheaval in the Baltics and the southern republics in recent months has stirred 
concern in Moscow that a nuclear weapons storage site could be overrun by 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The official discussed the matter on condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Two Administration officials said the Soviets were moving short-range nuclear 
weapons -- those capable of reaching neighboring countries but not the United 
States -- out of storage depots in the Baltics and some southern republics. 
</P>
<P>
Private experts on the Soviet military said the United States should view the 
development as reassuring because it indicates that Kremlin authorities are 
taking precautions in the face of political instability in the Baltics, which 
are pressing Moscow for independence, and in other republics torn by ethnic 
strife. 
</P>
<P>
Georgi V. Shchekochikhin, a Soviet Embassy spokesman, said he had no 
information on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials declined to say how many of the Soviets' estimated 33,000 
nuclear warheads are being moved. 
</P>
<P>
Private experts said the transfer of weapons does not affect the deployment of 
long-range nuclear arms capable of striking the United States. Thus, the shift 
has little, if any, effect on the military balance, although it does mean some 
Soviet weapons are farther from possible targets in Western Europe.

ROMANIA SANCTIONS RIVAL PARTIES;

<P>
DEMOCRACY: OPPOSITION GROUPS DISRUPTED BY RECENT VIOLENCE MAY OPERATE FREELY SO 
LONG AS POLITICAL DISPUTE DOES NOT TURN INTO STREET BATTLES.

<P>
As Romanians remembered the dead from December's revolution, the government 
promised Friday that the opposition may operate freely so long as political 
rivalry does not turn into street battles. 
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Front government also said there was no sign of illegal 
activity on the part of the opposition Liberal Party during pro- and 
anti-government violence in which six people were killed last week. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, six months after the uprising in which Stalinist dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu was executed, appeared to be a sweetener aimed at opposition 
and foreign critics who accuse the Front of reneging on its promises to foster 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is ready to grant its whole support to political and 
nonpolitical parties, organizations and associations whose activity was 
interrupted on June 13-15," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the period when riots flared after police violently quelled a protest 
in central Bucharest, and President Ion Iliescu deployed thousands of miners to 
crush the unrest, which he called an attempted fascist coup. 
</P>
<P>
The West has strongly condemned the action and imposed economic sanctions, 
while the opposition has accused Iliescu of authoritarian tactics. 
</P>
<P>
During the clashes, miners beat opposition suspects and ransacked party 
offices, effectively bringing opposition activities to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
The government statement Friday said opposition parties are free to "resume 
their operation on the basis of the legal status endorsed by judicial bodies." 
</P>
<P>
"Their free and unhampered activity constitutes a guarantee for the free 
expression of political and civic opinions," it said. But it warned against 
"street confrontations, which can turn into acts of violence." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's statement came as Romanians in churches, roadside shrines and 
cemeteries prayed, lit candles or laid wreaths to remember the more than 1,000 
dead in December's uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Romanians still argue whether the uprising against Ceausescu was a revolution 
or a Front-inspired coup. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu won a presidential election with a landslide majority May 20, and the 
Front scored a similar triumph in parliamentary polls, the first free vote in 
53 years. The opposition parties complained of vote-rigging by the Front. 
</P>
<P>
As required by law, Iliescu relinquished his role as the leader of the Front 
Friday to assume his presidential duties, Bucharest radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Petre Roman, in a newspaper interview, blamed remnants of 
Ceausescu's secret police for attacks on public property, which intensified 
last week's violence. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, one of Ceausescu's sisters, Maria Agache, went on trial 
in Bucharest on charges of fraud and abuse of privilege. 
</P>
<P>
Agache is the third member of the former dictator's immediate family to go on 
trial since January. On Thursday, Ceausescu's look-alike brother, also named 
Nicolae, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for inciting genocide and 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
The dictator's youngest son, Nicu, former Communist Party boss in the city of 
Sibiu, is being tried on similar charges, and two other Ceausescu children are 
imprisoned in Bucharest awaiting trial.

SOVIET UNION: THE CONSERVATIVE VICTORY FOR THE KEY POST IS A SETBACK FOR THE 
NATION'S LEADER AND FOR YELTSIN, HEAD OF ITS LARGEST REPUBLIC.

<P>
A hard-line critic of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform policies was 
elected Friday as the leader of the newly re-established Russian Communist 
Party, defeating a moderate reformer for the key post as conservatives gathered 
strength in advance of a crucial party congress here. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan K. Polozkov, the regional party leader from Krasnodar in southern Russia 
and a feisty defender of orthodox Marxism, won 52% of the votes in a second 
round of balloting for the post of party first secretary, according to 
delegates to the founding conference of the Russian Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Polozkov, a 55-year-old economist and veteran party official, defeated Oleg 
Lobov, 53, a former assistant to Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist president of 
Russia, in an election that had quickly become a test of strength between the 
party's resurgent conservatives and its moderate reformers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the official results will not be released by party officials until 
this morning, the victory was celebrated by conservatives Friday night as a 
major setback not only for Gorbachev, who is now under unprecedented 
conservative pressure, but also for Yeltsin, who had defeated Polozkov for the 
Russian presidency last month. 
</P>
<P>
Polozkov's nomination had already stirred deep passions among the party's 
radical reformers who saw his emergence as the top vote-getter among the seven 
candidates in the first round of balloting as evidence of a sharp swing to the 
right in the Russian party. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a pity if anyone but Polozkov headed this party," said Sergei B. 
Stankevich, Moscow's new deputy mayor, "because then the people would have some 
reason left for their illusions and hesitancy about this party. If Ivan 
Polozkov becomes first secretary, there will be no doubt about where he 
stands." 
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav Bragin, the party first secretary in Kalinin, outside Moscow, told 
the conference that the election of Polozkov would be "the sunset of our 
party." 
</P>
<P>
But Polozkov had probably captured the majority of the 2,700 conference 
delegates with a ringing attack on the party's leadership Wednesday and then a 
captivating question-and-answer session after his nomination Thursday. He also 
had the open support of military delegates to the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who have been on the attack from the opening of the 
conference Tuesday, believe that they will have the momentum now for a credible 
assault on Gorbachev's position as the party's general secretary when its 
leadership is reorganized during the congress of the national party that opens 
in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative strategy, political insiders say, will not be to oust 
Gorbachev but to "restore a balance" within the party leadership, as a 
conservative conference participant put it. The conservatives hope, the sources 
add, to prompt him to relinquish his party post while retaining the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Yegor K. Ligachev, the conservative standard-bearer in the party's Politburo, 
launched the campaign this week with a sharp attack on Gorbachev's manner of 
leadership, notably recent decisions that he has made allegedly without 
consulting other Politburo members. Ligachev then called for the election of a 
leader able to devote all his energy to party affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Polozkov, a Ligachev ally and his one-time assistant in the party's 
organization department, told the conference delegates that there is no crisis 
in the party or in the country -- only in the party's top leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the hardest-hitting speeches in the conservative onslaught against 
Gorbachev at the conference this week, Polozkov had accused the leadership -- 
by clear implication, Gorbachev himself -- of confusion in its thinking and 
weakness in carrying out its policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Inconsistency in matters of principle, lavish promises, tardiness in making 
serious decisions and an inability to correct errors promptly all show that the 
leadership lacks a clear-cut program for the renewal of socialism," Polozkov 
told the conference in that speech. 
</P>
<P>
This, and not any failure of Marxism, is why people are losing faith in 
socialism and why they doubt that the party can find a solution to the 
country's multiple problems, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
Polozkov later objected to characterization of his speech as critical of 
perestroika, as Gorbachev's reform program is known. 
</P>
<P>
"I am against a division into left- and right-wing forces," he told Radio 
Moscow's Interfax news agency, "and my speech should be attributed to my 
temperament and my unwillingness to put up with shortcomings in society and the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"I call for a speedy renewal of the party with a view to setting up a new 
Central Committee and local party committees that would work in the interests 
of most Communists. If we fail to criticize the Central Committee for its 
mistakes, that can be the end of the party." 
</P>
<P>
He said the party should borrow the most promising ideas from each of the 
movements within its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Polozkov, however, has campaigned against what he describes as the excesses of 
the country's fledgling entrepreneurs and denounced the informal political 
groups that have sprung up outside and even within the party. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his conservative stance, he had backing last month from Gorbachev when 
he ran against Yeltsin for the presidency of the Russian Federation, the 
largest of the 15 Soviet republics, whose Communist Party he now heads. 
</P>
<P>
Support for Polozkov was serious and solid from the outset, indicating that the 
conservatives had his candidacy well organized. In the first round, Polozkov 
won 1,017 votes to Lobov's 848 with more than 50% of the 2,633 votes cast 
needed for election.

MISKITO INDIANS CONTEND CONTRAS GET BETTER DEAL

Miskito Indian rebels formally ended their 9-year war against the Sandinista 
army this week but complained that they are getting a poor deal compared to 
other Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply because we are peasants doesn't mean we can be treated any worse than 
the Contras," said Manuel Cunningham, also known as Tiger 17, one of the 
military leaders of the ragtag group of 2,000 rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The Miskitos, like the better-known Contras, have been supplied with U.S. 
military and humanitarian aid. They often fought alongside the Contras and are 
often referred to as Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the war ended Feb. 25," said rebel leader Osorno Coliman, also known 
as Commander Blas, at a midweek ceremony in which the remaining 200 Miskito 
rebels handed in their weapons to U.N. peacekeeping forces. 
</P>
<P>
Coliman was referring to President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's election 
victory over Daniel Ortega, who was Sandinista president. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said that disarmament was "a big sacrifice. We have been fighting 
for a long time. Some have grown to love the war." 
</P>
<P>
The 25 or so wooden huts of Bilwaskarma, 250 miles north of Managua along 
Nicaragua's Caribbean coast, are built on stilts to protect against flooding 
during the May-to-October rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham and others complained that Chamorro's government, the United Nations 
and the United States are failing to provide promised food and clothing and 
have given the Miskitos little compensation for a return to civilian life.

Following are key dates in U.S. dialogue with Palestine Liberation 
Organization, suspended Wednesday by President Bush: 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 14, 1988: At Geneva press conference, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat renounces 
terrorism, meeting a U.S. precondition for resuming diplomatic dialogue broken 
off 13 years earlier. Arafat also affirms right of all parties in Mideast 
conflict "to exist in peace and security, including the state of Palestine, 
Israel and their neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State George P. Shultz says President Reagan has authorized 
opening "substantive dialogue" with PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 15: Israeli officials express shock at resumption of contacts, saying 
United States was deceived by the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 16: U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. holds initial meeting with 
PLO representatives in Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
May 30, 1990: Israeli security forces foil attempt by Palestinian guerrillas to 
land by speedboat on Israeli beach. Palestine Liberation Front, a small, 
radical PLO faction, claims responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
May 31: Arafat denies PLO had anything to do with attack but declines to 
criticize it or take action against Abul Abbas, head of Palestine Liberation 
Front. 
</P>
<P>
June 7: PLO Executive Committee, meeting in Baghdad, Iraq, refuses to condemn 
raid or expel Abbas. 
</P>
<P>
June 20: Bush says he is suspending contacts pending PLO's condemning raid and 
disciplining those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
June 21: PLO Executive Committee denounces suspension of dialogue but agrees to 
investigate raid.

The crime rate in France rose by 4.27% in 1989, the first increase in five 
years, according to official figures published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The rise was caused mostly by increases in drug offenses, car theft and 
offenses linked to illegal immigration, the police report said.

A blaze swept through an 18th-Century mansion in central Buckinghamshire on 
Friday, causing an estimated $86 million in damage to the building owned by an 
Arab sheik and crammed with antiques and art, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they had not yet determined what started the blaze at Dropmore 
House in Burnham, 30 miles northwest of London. 
</P>
<P>
The house is owned by Mahdi Tajir, 58, a former ambassador to Britain for the 
United Arab Emirates who is one of the world's richest men. 
</P>
<P>
Flames, some 30 feet high, damaged walls and ceilings and ruined the entire 
east wing of the stately $20-million house that included a room in which there 
were six solid-gold chairs. More than 80 firefighters battled the blaze, which 
raged for nine hours before being controlled.

OPPOSITION: MILITARY JUNTA SAYS IT IS WILLING TO MEET WITH MAY 27 ELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
The Myanmar military junta has agreed to hold talks on the transfer of power 
with the pro-democracy party, which swept last month's elections, an official 
spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question at a press conference, spokesman Kyaw Sann said the 
ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council is now willing to meet with 
leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD), the party that won more 
than 80% of the seats in the May 27 elections. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot, however, say when this meeting will take place," Kyaw Sann said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, NLD acting leader Kyi Maung said his party wants to open a dialogue 
with the military soon to discuss the transfer of power to a civilian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The military called the May election in an effort to improve its image abroad. 
Despite strict controls on campaigning by opposition parties, the military's 
own party won only a handful of seats in the newly created Parliament, which 
has yet to meet. 
</P>
<P>
Since the election, the military has made little effort to turn over power to 
civilian rule, despite repeated urging by the victors. 
</P>
<P>
The NLD has moved slowly and carefully to avoid giving the military any excuse 
to overturn the election. 
</P>
<P>
But it has been under increasing pressure from some of its youthful supporters 
to call for a quick transfer of power and the release of all political 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of political activists have been arrested since 
the military crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Among those under detention are the two top leaders of the NLD, Aung San Suu 
Kyi and Tin Oo. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the military and NLD need to discuss the release of the political 
prisoners, the drafting of a new constitution, the extent and pace at which the 
military will hand over power, and efforts to end the country's 40-year civil 
war with ethnic minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, the military showed videotapes of a meeting of the 
Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB) -- a group of minority insurgents and 
dissident students -- held last week at a jungle base near the border with 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Lt. Col. Ye Htut, said the alliance was demanding the 
creation of a federal union of Myanmar, with eight autonomous and politically 
equal states for the various ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Ye Htut said the insurgents also demanded that each state in the new union have 
its own armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"What the DAB wants to do is to turn insurgent armies . . . into legal armed 
forces in their respective states," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said such an arrangement could lead to bloody internal conflicts.

Setting aside years of animosity, the U.S. government joined with private 
humanitarian groups Friday to funnel medicine, tents, clothing, food and other 
relief materials to help earthquake-stricken Iran. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said the government gave $300,000 worth of supplies 
to the American Red Cross for shipment to Iran -- including 1,000 hard hats, 
1,000 pairs of leather gloves, 10,000 face masks, 2,940 wool blankets and about 
500 tents. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military, which often is used to ferry relief supplies to countries in 
need, stood ready to offer transport planes and logistics support for any U.S. 
aid requested by Iran. However, a Pentagon official said it is unlikely that 
the State Department and the White House would authorize a military airlift of 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty clear that the Iranians don't want us, and there are so many 
alternatives, such as private charters, it really isn't necessary," the 
officials said. "In a case like this, we would really be more of an irritant 
than a help." 
</P>
<P>
The quake, which rocked the northern region of Iran early Thursday, left nearly 
29,000 dead, by official count, and about 400,000 homeless. The death toll is 
expected to rise, however, as rescuers continue work. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, the Iranian Red Crescent appealed for help from the Red Cross 
and Red Crescent Society, a Geneva-based umbrella for international 
humanitarian organizations. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who toured 
the stricken region Friday, also appealed for international aid. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Davis, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in Washington, said Friday 
that although the Red Crescent is highly organized and well equipped, the large 
number of dead and suffering people has forced the Iranian agency to solicit 
international assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross responded by mobilizing its local offices to solicit 
money, informing its toll-free telephone operators to request earmarked 
donations for the earthquake victims and sending $50,000 in cash to the Red 
Crescent Society to be used to help needy Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
Some Jewish relief organizations found themselves in an uncomfortable position 
because of Iran's hostility toward the United States and Israel. Confronted 
with reports that Iran would not welcome assistance from Israel, the groups 
were uncertain whether they should offer any assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Griffel, executive director of American Jewish World Service, said 
directors of the assistance organization participated in a conference call 
Friday morning to debate whether to collect money for the Iranian victims. 
</P>
<P>
After a spirited discussion, the group decided to help but to monitor the 
situation closely and to be prepared to change their decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a humanitarian organization . . . without regard to political 
considerations," Griffel said. "But if they are going politicize it, we will 
definitely reconsider our participation." 
</P>
<P>
Amir Zamani, a spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations, 
welcomed the "many offers from many organizations" that his office has 
received. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran needs assistance, and such organizations are welcome to send it." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging Iran's strained relations with many nations, Zamani said his 
country is attempting to ease the antagonism to deal with the disaster in the 
country. As an example, he said "no formalities" will be required for relief 
planes flying into Iran. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that aid shipments will be coordinated by the government and 
routed through Tehran because there are no other airports in the country that 
can accommodate large transport planes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other U.S. groups were rushing to supply Iran with emergency goods. 
</P>
<P>
Dwain Schenck, a relief worker for AmeriCares Foundation, said the 
Connecticut-based relief group expects to send 80,000 pounds of medical 
supplies, two doctors, a nurse and about half a dozen relief workers to Iran 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to be there about four days or so," he said.

SWISS LINK IRANIAN GOVERNMENT TO ASSASSINATION OF REBEL LEADER

Swiss justice authorities Friday charged that Iranian government agencies 
directly planned and carried out the assassination in Switzerland of resistance 
leader Kazem Radjavi. 
</P>
<P>
Radjavi, 56, was gunned down April 24 by two masked men in the small town of 
Coppet on Lake Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The brother of Massoud Radjavi, head of the Iraq-based Khalq resistance 
movement, Kazem acted as a lobbyist at U.N. human rights meetings against the 
fundamentalist regime in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by Swiss investigating magistrates Friday said there was evidence 
that 13 people had taken part in "minutely planning the killing" beginning in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
It said assassination team members with Iranian government service passports -- 
"all issued on the same date" -- flew between Tehran and Geneva on Iran Air and 
stayed at hotels in and around Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
"At the current stage of the investigation, police have collected various 
evidence that one or more official Iranian agencies were directly involved in 
the assassination of Kazem Radjavi," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the actual assassination squad comprised four persons," it 
said. "The investigation has shown that several persons left Geneva by air for 
Vienna less than two hours after the murder." 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the two men who gunned Radjavi down had passports issued in the 
"almost certainly false" names of Yadollah Samadi and Mohammad Said Rezvani, 
the statement said.

Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, a key figure in the network set 
up by former White House aide Oliver L. North to arm the Nicaraguan Contras, 
agreed Friday to drop an appeal of his conviction for his role in the 
Iran-Contra affair, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
In a plea agreement with independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, Secord last 
year pleaded guilty to a felony count of lying to congressional investigators 
and was sentenced to two years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
He then appealed a technical ruling previously made by the judge in the case, 
an action that drew a sharp protest from Walsh, who charged that the appeal was 
a violation of the spirit of the plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
If Secord's appeal had succeeded, it could have overturned his conviction.

LAWYER FOR CITY PUTS BARRY AT DRUG USE SITE

An attorney for the city government testified in Marion Barry's drug and 
perjury trial Friday that he found the mayor slumped one night in a bathroom 
littered with drug paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
"The smoke and the . . . smell . . . got stronger as the evening went on," said 
James McWilliams, recalling a December, 1988, night he spent with Barry and key 
prosecution witness Charles Lewis at a Washington hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams, who is cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to 
drug-related charges, backed up testimony by Lewis about the evening of alleged 
crack cocaine use by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams said he went to Lewis' room that night to discuss a job transfer 
with the mayor. But the bearded McWilliams said that, as he pressed his case, 
Barry just told him at one point, "You know, you look a lot like Santa Claus." 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams, a legal counsel for the city's Department of Public Works, 
testified that he helped Lewis and Barry hide the alleged drug use from police 
investigators "because I was protecting Marion Barry." 
</P>
<P>
Barry, 54, is facing three felony charges of perjury, 10 misdemeanor charges of 
cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy to possess cocaine. 
He has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a convicted drug dealer, testified earlier this week that he had used 
drugs with Barry repeatedly between 1986 and 1988 and smoked crack cocaine with 
him on four occasions in Lewis' Washington room, including Dec. 19, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams said that, when he arrived at Lewis' room that night, Lewis first 
asked him for $40 to "go out and get some stuff," McWilliams testified, 
</P>
<P>
"I understood he was going to go out and get some drugs" with the money, 
McWilliams said. Lewis came back with a plastic bag "that had a white substance 
inside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who McWilliams said arrived later, then went repeatedly with Lewis into 
the bathroom and kitchen. Smoke and "a strong unusual smell" from the bathroom 
grew as McWilliams watched football on television, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams, a former assistant attorney general in the Virgin Islands, said he 
tried to talk to Barry about the job transfer, but "I didn't think I was 
getting through."

CUT RADIATION EXPOSURE 60%, PANEL TO URGE 
</P>

<P>
An international panel of experts said Friday that radiation is three times 
more health-damaging than previously thought and it will recommend that 
governments reduce worker exposure limits by 60%. 
</P>
<P>
The International Commission on Radiological Protection, an advisory panel of 
radiation experts, said new studies -- particularly those focusing on Japanese 
atomic bomb survivors -- show radiation is a more potent cause of cancer and 
genetic damage than was estimated by the panel 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Radiation is more risky than we thought in 1977 (by) a factor of three . . . " 
said Dan Beninson, chairman of the commission and head of Argentina's nuclear 
energy commission. 
</P>
<P>
Beninson told reporters also that the new health risk estimates underlined more 
clearly than ever before that even low levels of radiation are hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
"Any dose of radiation, no matter how small, means a risk," he said. "The 
larger the dose, the larger the risk, but we don't say there is any dose where 
there is no risk." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's conclusions are similar to the findings announced several 
months ago by a National Academy of Sciences panel, which said radiation was 
three to four times as deadly as previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of its new health risk estimates, the international commission said 
that it would revise its 1977 radiation protection guidelines later this year 
to recommend that governments reduce occupational exposure limits to two rems 
of radiation a year from five rems. 
</P>
<P>
The occupational exposure limits apply to nuclear power plant workers, uranium 
miners, medical personnel administering X-rays and other workers routinely 
exposed to radiation sources on the job. 
</P>
<P>
For the public, the commission said it would recommend no change in its current 
annual limit of 100 millirem -- one-tenth of a rem -- based on average exposure 
over a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
However, the panel said it would effectively tighten the standard by 
recommending the 100-millirem limit be applied over an averaging period of five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ingram, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which 
sets U.S. radiation exposure standards, said the agency had no immediate 
response to the commission's findings.

'MURDER EPIDEMIC' ALARMS CHICAGO; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE CITY THAT INVENTED DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS DURING PROHIBITION IS NOW 
PLAGUED BY THEM. POLICE BLAME GANG ACTIVITY.

<P>
Mayor Richard M. Daley, top police officials and prosecutors gathered on a 
South Side street corner one morning earlier this month to watch as a wrecking 
crew began dismantling a weathered two-story building. 
</P>
<P>
It was the former headquarters of the El Rukns, the city's most notorious 
street gang, an organization that after 24 years of dealing in extortion, 
drugs, weapons and murder had finally been decimated by prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite the dismantling of the El Rukn organization and of its 
headquarters, a wave of murders could make 1990 one of the bloodiest years in 
the city's history. Much of the killing is related to gang activity and 
involves drive-by shootings, a phenomenon that is old hat in Los Angeles but is 
just starting to catch on in a big way in Midwestern cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, (gang members) used to ride on bicycles and have fist fights," said 
Chief John Townsend of the police detective bureau. "Now, they drive Buicks and 
Cadillacs and have gunfights with high-priced weapons." 
</P>
<P>
So far this year there have been 375 murders in Chicago, and police are bracing 
for the summer months, when most homicides are committed. Not since 1974 -- 
when a record 970 people were slain in the city -- have there been so many 
killings by this time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
This year's figures, which one Chicago alderman said amount to a "murder 
epidemic," still compare favorably with Los Angeles, where 412 people were 
killed through June 14 this year. Los Angeles' record year for homicides was 
1980, when 1,028 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
What has people so alarmed here is the rapid increase in the number of 
gang-related killings, especially drive-by shootings in which innocent 
bystanders sometimes are hit. From June, 1989 to May, 1990, Chicago had 334 
drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
For a number of years, Los Angeles gangs have been branching out, exporting 
their members and drugs to other parts of the country. Neither the Bloods nor 
the Crips has established operations in Chicago -- police say the strength of 
local gangs has prevented that -- but their preferred means of exterminating 
rivals appears to be growing more popular. 
</P>
<P>
In a historical sense, drive-by shootings are not new to Chicago. "We were the 
original," said Cmdr. James Fruin of Chicago's Area 5 police district, one of 
the hardest hit by gangs. He was referring to Prohibition-era gangsters -- the 
kind who sported pinstripe suits, drove long black sedans and carried Tommy 
guns in violin cases. They also favored drive-by shootings, as any fan of 
vintage gangster movies knows. 
</P>
<P>
But, after a long period in which this method of killing was relatively rare 
here, it now has become almost commonplace in some neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've been inundated with it," Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
The level of violence is unrivaled by that of past generations of criminals, 
Townsend said. "They knew who they were after," he said of Chicago's classic 
mobsters. "They knew who was coming out of the restaurant or barber shop." 
</P>
<P>
Police attribute the increase in murders to narcotics activity. Other 
Midwestern cities have seen similar increases with the arrival of crack, the 
smokable form of cocaine, but police here say crack is still not a major 
problem in Chicago. "Who knows what it is," Fruin said. 
</P>
<P>
June has been a particularly bloody month. Thirty-two people were killed during 
the first nine days alone. A number of them were shot down in drive-by 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Sims, a mechanic, was shot at 2:40 a.m. on June 8 as he left the home of 
his girlfriend on Chicago's South Side. Police say he was shot by two men 
driving past in a car because he wore a baseball cap cocked to the right side 
of his head. His assailants belonged to a gang whose members wore their caps 
tilted to the left, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 20 people were killed that week in the city for myriad reasons. An 
additional 122 people were shot or stabbed but survived, according to police 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in gang violence recently caused Police Supt. LeRoy Martin to 
assign 50 additional officers to the gang crimes unit and has led to calls for 
extraordinary measures. 
</P>
<P>
Two Chicago aldermen have called for City Council hearings on the "murder 
epidemic" and urged that the city hire an additional 2,000 police officers to 
patrol neighborhoods "around-the-clock." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the upsurge in violence, a Chicago state representative has 
introduced a bill that would allow the police to confiscate any vehicle in 
which an unregistered gun is found. 
</P>
<P>
In some Chicago suburbs, residents who left the cities to escape such urban 
problems as gangs and crime are pressing the police to take strenuous measures 
to drive the gang members out. 
</P>
<P>
In Aurora, a suburb particularly hard hit by gang violence, the City Council 
enacted ordinances earlier this month that would allow police officers to 
detain people displaying gang colors or flashing gang signs. The laws also 
allow the arrest of people who appear to be engaging in prostitution or drug 
trafficking without police officers' having to see them commit a crime. 
Questions about the constitutionality of the laws were quickly raised, but in 
some quarters the new laws were applauded.

AIDS CONFERENCE NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
DOCTOR WITH HIV TELLS OF BEING SHUNNED BY PEERS 
</P>

<P>
Finding a doctor willing to care for them is hard for people with HIV ailments. 
That may not change much despite a new education effort announced here by the 
American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A study released here this week found that 63% of medical school residents 
asked anonymously said they would avoid AIDS patients. Just 17% said they would 
accept AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hacib Auon of Baltimore, who was infected with the human immunodeficienty 
virus seven years ago while treating a leukemia patient at Johns Hopkins 
University, said in a talk to physicians and AIDS researchers that he learned a 
bitter lesson when colleagues turned their backs on him. 
</P>
<P>
He said friends, doctors and fellow medical students shunned him. Once the 
chief resident at Johns Hopkins, Auon has since done legal battle with the 
university and reportedly had to fight the school for the right to speak here. 
</P>
<P>
"Organized medicine has no room for a physician with AIDS," said Auon, 34, who 
is married with a young daughter. "What an awful message to send to society." 
</P>
<P>
To the physicians in the audience, he added: "Next time that you have the 
opportunity to care for an AIDS patient, I hope you extend your hand." 
</P>
<P>
Another 140 protesters were arrested Friday afternoon by San Francisco police, 
this time for sitting down and blocking a busy intersection to demonstrate for 
more services for women and minorities with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the arrest total for the week is now more than 280, including a few 
news media members who got caught when officers swooped on the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
The arrested were mainly from the group ACT UP, which organized the protest. 
</P>
<P>
At a cocktails-and-crudites reception Thursday evening in the Nikko Hotel, 
about 75 AIDS professionals politely applauded the news from a series of 
clinical drug trials by the American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
But at the mention of Madonna, the room erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna, it was announced, has agreed to donate all profits from the closing 
concert of her current "Blond Ambition" tour to the clinical trials program. 
The gift from the sold-out concert at the Brendan Byrne Arena in New Jersey 
could exceed $300,000, and the money could be in the clinics by mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
"We literally are overwhelmed by the generosity of Madonna's gift," said Dr. 
Mathilde Krim, the group's founding co-chair. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time during the conference that the American Foundation for 
AIDS Research made a celebrity coup. The group also produced Elizabeth Taylor 
for her first appearance since being hospitalized in Santa Monica for 
pnuemonia. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor made a brief appearance before more than 100 of the AIDS field's biggest 
stars at a reception at the trendy Postrio restaurant. The audience waited 
patiently for more than an hour for a glimpse of Taylor, who spoke about for 
seven minutes from a podium, then was helped out of the room.

ILLEGALS, DAY LABORERS WIN IN 2 RULINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of two victories Friday for immigrants rights advocates, Housing and 
Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp said the agency's community development 
grants cannot be used for programs that discriminate against illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
His directive followed a meeting Wednesday in Washington between Kemp, 
immigrant rights groups and officials from the city of Costa Mesa, which had 
tried to bar charitable groups from serving illegal aliens by threatening to 
cut off their share of the federal money. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development in Orange County, a Superior Court commissioner ruled 
unconstitutional a portion of a Costa Mesa ordinance that prohibits day 
laborers from congregating in certain areas of the city with the intent of 
soliciting work. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling came in response to a suit by the American Civil Liberties Union, 
which also filed suit against the city of Encinitas on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Of his ruling on the use of HUD funds, Kemp said: "The purpose (of community 
development block grant funds) is to serve the entire community, and if it were 
predicated on whether a person is documented or not, it would be discriminatory 
and counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp, who lived for a time in Costa Mesa and whose sister-in-law works at a 
shelter for battered women there, also said implementation of policies similar 
to that proposed in Costa Mesa would have the kind of "inflammatory impact in 
communities that we don't want in America." 
</P>
<P>
In ruling against Costa Mesa's work-solicitation law, Commissioner Ronald L. 
Bauer said it was "overly broad and vague and impinges on expression of 
speech." 
</P>
<P>
"The language (of the ordinance) appears to have the effect of a dragnet that 
extends far beyond the legitimate goal of regulating traffic," Bauer said in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa adopted a measure that identified three areas of the city that draw 
the heaviest concentrations of day laborers. It prohibited anyone from being 
within 300 feet of those sites with the intent to solicit employment from the 
occupant of a motor vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The measure empowered police to arrest people based on "circumstantial 
evidence," but did not spell out what constituted intent. Previously, police 
had to catch a day laborer in the act of solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorney Rebecca Jurado hailed the ruling as a clear message that cities 
cannot, under the pretext of regulating traffic, try to exclude day laborers 
from parks and other areas where they congregate. 
</P>
<P>
In the Encinitas law, the City Council voted May 23 to empower the San Diego 
County Sheriff's Department to cite persons who, on public property or along 
public streets, stop to solicit day laborers. Conviction calls for a $100 fine 
on the first violation, and stiffer fines for repeat violations. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Smith, regional counsel for California Rural Legal Assistance, said the 
Encinitas ordinance nonetheless unfairly targets people who are legitimately 
looking for work and have been stymied in finding it at established locations.

PRESIDENT OF MILLS COLLEGE RESIGNS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SHE SAYS SHE CANNOT MAKE A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO THE SCHOOL WHILE 
IT STRUGGLES TO BOOST ENROLLMENT TO KEEP IT FROM GOING CO-ED.

<P>
Mills College President Mary Metz has resigned, seven weeks after her hesitant 
support for a now-abandoned proposal to admit men to the women's school sparked 
passionate criticism from students. 
</P>
<P>
Metz said in a written statement that she was leaving because she could not 
commit herself to stay at Mills during a demanding five-year plan to boost 
enrollment by nearly one-third and raise $10 million to keep the college from 
having to go co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
Metz was unavailable for comment Friday, but a college spokesperson said Metz 
decided to pursue other professional opportunities and permit the college to 
find someone able to make a long-term commitment to lead Mills. 
</P>
<P>
Students' anger and charges that Metz betrayed them by going along with plans 
to admit undergraduate men in 1991 also took a toll on the nine-year Mills 
president, colleagues said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine that it didn't hurt," said Terry Fairman, an alumna who sits 
on the Board of Trustees. "Mary is a very human person. That's the reason the 
students liked her so much, but it also makes her more vulnerable to their 
anger." 
</P>
<P>
Some students still harbor resentment they first felt when Metz and the 
trustees announced in May the plans to boost enrollment by admitting men, 
student body President Melissa Stevenson-Dile said. Students will have mixed 
emotions when they learn of Metz's departure, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Her seeming betrayal was really what sparked our anger," Stevenson-Dile said. 
"There was a great deal of animosity that came out of that. I'm hopeful that 
now we can clear the air." 
</P>
<P>
Student protests and a campus strike prompted Mills' trustees to reverse their 
decision to make the college, which already accepts male graduate students, 
completely co-ed. The trustees agreed to let Mills remain a women's college 
until 1995, provided cost-cutting and enrollment-boosting measures could help 
erase an annual deficit of $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson-Dile and Metz's colleagues praised the outgoing president for her 
leadership of what has long been considered the premier women's college in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Under Metz's leadership, Mills tripled its endowment, which now totals $72 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had phenomenal success in fund-raising, and a lot of that is due to 
the tireless work of Dr. Metz," said Donna Howard, Mills vice president for 
institutional advancement. 
</P>
<P>
Mills trustee and former Vassar College President Virginia Smith will become 
acting Mills College president, pending a search for someone to fill the post 
permanently, a Mills spokesman said. Smith also has a proven track record in 
raising money for colleges, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland school will need all the help it can get to bring in enough money 
to remain an all-woman college, Mills officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have a ton of work to do," said Warren Hellman, chairman of the Mills 
Board of Trustees. "We've got to translate a lot of enthusiasm into action."

MORATORIUM IMPOSED ON DWP TOURS; 
</P>
<P>
EXPENSES: BRADLEY SAYS FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY 'SHOULD BE OF PARAMOUNT 
IMPORTANCE.' THE PROGRAM HAS COST NEARLY$1 MILLION IN THE PAST YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday imposed an immediate moratorium on a Department of 
Water and Power tour program that has cost nearly $1 million in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
With stiff budget restraints at other agencies and a costly water-rationing 
plan under consideration at the DWP, Bradley said, "It is a time when fiscal 
responsibility should be of paramount importance. . . . Exorbitant expenditures 
undermine the public's confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley issued the order in response to a Times story Friday detailing a 
$913,000 tour program in which legislators, business customers and department 
executives received all-expenses-paid tours of DWP facilities throughout the 
West. Department officials say the tours are necessary to update officials on 
the utility's needs and plans. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the DWP Board of Commissioners, Bradley ordered a report on the 
necessity of such trips and added, "If some prove absolutely essential, I want 
an outline as to the less expensive modes of travel, boarding and cost of 
meals." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, in criticizing DWP expense policies for the second time in a week, 
said, "Lodging in first-rate hotels and chartered flights clearly are an 
unneeded perk." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bradley chastised the utility for chartering private jets when 
cheaper commercial flights were available. The mayor demanded tough new travel 
restrictions and ordered commissioners "to take immediate action to prevent a 
recurrence" of controversial expenditures such as a $95-a-head meal for five 
officials in Salt Lake City and a $2,800 charter jet flight that DWP General 
Manager Norm Nichols took to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bradley said he wanted the Board of Commissioners to approve all 
major travel expenditures in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that action, combined with the moratorium ordered Friday, "will 
hopefully rebuild the confidence I fear has been eroded" at the giant 
city-owned utility. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members on Friday also were quick to react to reports of the DWP's 
unusually extensive and costly tour program. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter filed a motion calling for a similar report on tour 
expenditures. Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores suggested that money saved from 
halting the program could be used to offset rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
In her motion, Galanter said, "While trips to remote facilities can be a 
valuable tool, expensive dinners and lavish accommodations do not necessarily 
pay equivalent dividends." Galanter, who like most city elected officials has 
attended DWP tours, said it was "very educational." 
</P>
<P>
Flores also acknowledged that the tours were valuable but added, "Sometimes the 
department becomes overzealous." 
</P>
<P>
While supporting the mayor's call for a moratorium, she said, "It's a shame 
that the mayor's office has not been aware (of the tour cost) and had to wait 
for the newspapers to uncover it." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Caruso, president of the DWP Board of Commissioners, said he would put the 
mayor's demands on the board's next meeting agenda, but otherwise had no 
comment on Bradley's action. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Caruso said, "It's important for government officials, bankers and 
environmental groups to see these places and understand what's going on and 
what's involved in bringing water and power to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials said that as a result of the mayor's order, all tours have been 
cancelled, including two bus tours scheduled next week to the Owens Valley. One 
tour was for a group of Los Angeles teachers and another for Museum of Science 
and Industry docents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a shame," said DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen.

LONGSHOREMEN'S JOB LOTTERY DRAWS LONG LINE OF HOPEFUL WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
About 400 would-be female dockworkers gathered Friday at the longshoremen's 
union hall in Wilmington, a place where Lady Luck traditionally has not been 
much of a sister to women. 
</P>
<P>
It's a place where the brawniest men will tell you, in whispers, that your best 
chance at landing a job is to have a father or brother or uncle already working 
the docks. 
</P>
<P>
To try and change all that, and satisfy the settlement terms of a decade-old 
sex discrimination lawsuit, a drawing was held for 350 $14-an-hour dockworker 
jobs Friday at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union Hall, 
Local 13. The one-hour lottery, conducted by the ILWU and Pacific Maritime 
Assn., will assure that more women will be working part-time on the docks, as 
longshoremen or clerks, by September. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 5,778 women submitted application cards for the jobs, and 700 names 
were called, enough to make sure 350 women will be hired. When that happens, 
35% of the part-time dockworkers in the nation's busiest harbor will be women. 
And they, like other part-timers, will be positioned to become full-time 
dockworkers, whose pay now averages $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although they did not have to be present for the drawing, several hundred women 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a wannabe," said Heather McDonald, 37, a onetime cabbie from Torrance who 
came wearing a Teamsters Union jacket. Now working as a welder at the Long 
Beach Naval Shipyard, McDonald signed up for the drawing as a hedge against 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm making the same money now. But with Bush cutting back on the defense 
budget, we've had cuts at the yards. And I want to stay employed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, like most of the women at the drawing, did not get called. 
</P>
<P>
But Tanya Heard and Pamela Clark beat the odds. The sisters from Gardena were 
among those called. Now, they'll wait to be screened with physicals, strength 
and agility tests, and drug and alcohol testing. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as you can write, they say you can pass," said Heard, 27. 
</P>
<P>
While the sisters first considered working on the docks only a few weeks ago, 
many women at the drawing have coveted the jobs for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had my application in for a while," said Dana Rolland, a 23-year-old 
hairdresser from Wilmington whose mother, May, has been a dockworker for eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-3 and 100 pounds, Rolland hardly looks the part of a dockworker. But 
it is a job she not only wants but believes she deserves. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel family should get the jobs first," she said. "Everyone should have 
equal opportunities, but there should be some sort of seniority for family." 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment has prevailed for decades among many longshoremen and their 
families. But in 1982, the courts stepped in with a landmark decision opening 
the docks to more women. 
</P>
<P>
During the drawing, catcalls greeted some names as they were called out -- 
names that some thought were too familiar, too close to those of current 
dockworkers, to be a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
But Carrie Clements, assistant area manager for the maritime association, 
bristled after the drawing at the notion that anyone would raise suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what else we could do," Clements said, noting the drawing was 
open to the public, conducted by an outside arbitrator and videotaped. "It's 
about as fair as you can get," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fairness aside, the drawing itself irked a few longshoremen, who saw it as 
nothing but a handout for women. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous," said Roberto Diaz, a longshoreman the last 10 years. "Who's 
got more rights, men or women?" Diaz asked. "For me, it's men." 
</P>
<P>
Not all longshoremen were upset. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me at all," said Jesse Smith, a bearish 39-year-old who has 
worked on the docks for 21 years. "There are some women who are excellent 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, they don't compare to me," said Smith, 6-foot-3 and 326 pounds. 
"But a lot of men can't compare with me either."

PROGRAM ENROLLS TEACHING RECRUITS IN SUMMER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Take 510 recent graduates of the nation's top colleges. Put them in intensive 
teacher training courses on the USC campus and in summer classrooms of 
year-round elementary and high schools of Los Angeles for eight weeks. Stir in 
large doses of idealism and enthusiasm. Then send them off to teach in inner 
cities and rural areas across the country with a lot of advice and 
encouragement along the way. 
</P>
<P>
That's the recipe for Teach For America, a new campaign aimed at easing the 
shortage of teachers and renewing respect for the profession. The program, 
which begins this weekend, is modeled partly on the Peace Corps and is the 
brainchild of a 1989 graduate of Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
"This is based on the theory that everyone here wants one thing, and that is to 
make an impact. There are just not a lot of other opportunities for people to 
live their idealism after graduation," explained founder Wendy Kopp, 22, who 
has won national acclaim and more than $1 million in corporate and foundation 
backing for her idea. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was chosen as site for the premier summer because of the many 
year-round schools where prospective teachers can observe mentors and take 
fledgling steps in front of the chalkboard. About 225 of the Teach For America 
recruits plan to take teaching jobs in the fall in Los Angeles and nearby 
districts, while the rest go to New York, Louisiana, North Carolina and 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
They are all committed to teach for at least two years, during which some can 
erase part of their federally backed college student loans. But even those who 
switch careers later "at least will have the experience to be really effective 
advocates for educational improvement," Kopp said during an interview in a 
makeshift office at a USC dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
In high spirits, the 510 new teachers arrived the past two days at USC, where 
Kopp's group is renting dormitory and classroom space. Fifty education 
professors and veteran teachers from across the United States also are on 
campus to prepare the troops for the upcoming adventures in lesson plans, 
discipline and student motivation. The mood combines the friendliness of a 
summer camp with the fervor of a high-minded political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Mike Loverude, 21, a Wisconsin native, graduated this month with a 
physics degree from Carleton College in Minnesota. He said he passed up a job 
offer from an electric power company and joined the teaching program out of a 
sense of social obligation. "I could be working in a nuclear power plant, but 
this is more rewarding," he said. "If I can get through to some people and get 
someone to go to college, I'll feel I did something." 
</P>
<P>
In September, Loverude will take a high school science post in New Orleans. He 
hopes he doesn't experience resentment for being an inexperienced outsider. 
"We're not coming down from on high to save the masses. We just want to do a 
good job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
James Dawson, 29, a graduate last year from Alabama State University, wants to 
be a math teacher in the New York area where he grew up. "This summer will let 
me know if I can handle it," said Dawson. "I'll find out if the kids think 
whether this guy really cares or he is foolish." His role model, he said, is 
his high school math teacher who, Dawson recalled, "helped me to believe in 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Pacheco and Miguel Ceballos, a married couple, moved from Texas back to 
their native California for Teach For America. They said they were attracted by 
the program's strong emphasis on multicultural learning. 
</P>
<P>
A 1983 graduate of Mills College, Pacheco, 30, recently worked in Texas 
educating farm workers about the safe use of pesticides. She hopes to transfer 
those skills to a bilingual elementary school class in Los Angeles. Her husband 
attended Roosevelt High in Los Angeles, has a bachelor's degree from UC 
Berkeley and a master's in Latin American studies and economics from the 
University of Texas. Ceballos, 34, wants to teach math at Roosevelt because, he 
said, "I believe I have a responsibility to contribute something back to my 
community." 
</P>
<P>
All recruits receive room and board for the summer, while the neediest can get 
a $25 weekly stipend. Starting salaries in the fall range from $17,000 to 
$29,000 a year, depending on the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District is delighted to have all 510 as student 
teachers this summer and to keep about 100 as full-time instructors in the 
fall, according to Bob De Vries, director of university-college relations for 
the district. "This is a kind of recruiting for us and it at least gives these 
people an induction program for eight weeks, which is certainly better than 
coming off the street." 
</P>
<P>
De Vries said some participants may be naive about the realities of city 
schools. But he said their energy and idealism "is beautiful and I wouldn't see 
any reason why they wouldn't be very successful." 
</P>
<P>
There have been similar programs, notably the federal Teachers Corps, which was 
born during Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty and died during cutbacks in the 
Reagan Administration. Also, California and other states with teacher shortages 
allow college graduates without formal teacher training to work in the 
classroom on a provisional basis if they pass special tests and take courses 
for a credential. 
</P>
<P>
Teach For America members will have to abide by those state rules and pass 
those tests. But Kopp stresses that her program is special because it is so 
selective and designed to create esprit de corps among energetic young people. 
After recruiting at 100 colleges, the organization chose 510 of 2,500 
applicants. In the fall, it will have offices in six areas around the country 
where its full-time staff of 21 can offer workshops and support for new 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers hired without formal credentials often feel overwhelmed and isolated, 
said Carl Grant, who is dean of the program's summer faculty at USC. A 
professor of education and Afro-American studies at the University of Wisconsin 
at Madison, Grant said the summer courses will stress collegiality and 
professionalism in teaching, down to details about proper dress. 
</P>
<P>
Grant bristled at a suggestion that he is working on an experiment: "In an 
experiment, there is the possibility that something might not possibly work. 
This is going to work." Yet he cautions against expecting any "60-day wonders" 
from the summer institute. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Teach For America has overcome some big obstacles. The valedictorian at 
her Dallas high school, Kopp wrote her senior thesis in public affairs at 
Princeton about a new teacher corps -- an idea sparked at an education 
conference in 1988. Then she began banging on the doors of corporate America, 
eventually garnering donations from Mobil, Xerox, Chrysler, Philip Morris and 
others. She now has to raise another $1.2 million to receive a $500,000 
challenge grant from Texas businessman H. Ross Perot. Hollywood circles are 
sure to hear from her in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp wants Teach For America to have 1,000 recruits in next summer's group and 
to attain the respected status of the Peace Corps. "We're hoping it becomes an 
American institution," she said.

Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday signed into law an ordinance creating a city 
Housing Preservation and Production Department and a Commission on Affordable 
Housing. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's office announced earlier that the department would be formed so the 
city's housing programs could be centralized into a single agency with a 
mandate to analyze the affordable housing crisis and implement programs to 
provide more housing. 
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive examination of housing issues in this city is necessary for us 
to address this problem that depletes the quality of life for too many Los 
Angeles residents," Bradley said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEXICAN FRUIT FLY FIND PROMPTS SETTING OF 
TRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discovery of a Mexican fruit fly this week in a trap in South Los Angeles 
has prompted agriculture officials to set scores of new traps to determine if 
there is an infestation in the area or if the fly is a so-called "lone 
hitchhiker." 
</P>
<P>
The unmated female fly was found in a trap that had been set in a lemon tree in 
a residence not far from the city's border with Vernon, said a spokesman for 
the state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, workers will set 80 additional traps in the square mile around the 
spot, 40 traps in the square mile surrounding that and 20, 10 and five traps in 
the successive square-mile zones. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the fruit that attracts the Mexican fruit fly is the same that appeals 
to the Mediterranean fruit fly.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SARAH FLORES SEEKS TO INTERVENE IN RIGHTS 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sarah Flores, whose campaign for Los Angeles County supervisor was thrown into 
limbo by a court decision striking down the county's redistricting plan, sought 
Friday to intervene in the voting rights case. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed in federal court, Flores said the case has thrown her campaign 
into chaos, making it "impossible for me to raise significant sums of money, 
form plans for effective campaigning and generate enthusiasm among volunteers 
and voters." 
</P>
<P>
Flores was the top vote-getter in the June 5 election to fill the seat being 
vacated by Supervisor Pete Schabarum. Because she failed to receive a majority 
of the vote, she is due to face Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien in a November 
runoff. But lawsuit plaintiffs have asked U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon 
to call off the runoff and schedule elections under new district lines in 
November.

<P>
Right up front, let's say something nice about Colombia. It has very 
hard-working people. It makes very good coffee. And its soccer team, led by 
Ready Freddy Rincon, looked absolutely super in tying West Germany, 1-1, thus 
qualifying for the second round of the World Cup. Colombia, we salute you. 
</P>
<P>
We mention this because we were reading that El Siglo, a Bogota newspaper, made 
a point of pointing out that the world's press has been praising Colombia's 
soccer performance and "for the first time it has forgotten to disparage our 
country." Ow.

<P>
For the record, even as a United States journalist, I found myself very happy 
for Colombia when Freddy's last-minute shot went between the German 
goalkeeper's legs, touching off a celebration in northern South America that 
still hasn't stopped. I even made an entry in my journal that day: "Good effort 
by Colombians. Don't disparage their country." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, after seeing the United States play soccer, I was too busy disparaging 
my own. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on to World Cup journal, Week 2. 
</P>
<P>
Say, here's a guy some of you Americans might like. His name is Karl 
Fliegenbauer, and he's a soccer-basher. 
</P>
<P>
Fliegenbauer runs a pub in Passau, West Germany. No, the place is not called 
Fliegenbauer's, although surely somebody somewhere ought to open a place called 
Fliegenbauer's, or maybe McFliegenbauer's, or the International House of 
Fliegenbauer's, or possibly even Thank God It's Fliegenbauer's. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, my main man Karl has taken a firm stand. On the menu of his Bavarian 
hofbrau, which is officially named the Weisses Kreuz, he has formally decreed 
the place a "soccer-free zone," to serve solely the interests of people who 
cannot stomach one more word about World Cup soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Herr Fliegenbauer claims that any of his customers discovered discussing soccer 
or even mentioning soccer will be flashed a red card, banishing them from his 
establishment for the remainder of the tournament. Frankly, we suspect this was 
Plan B for Karl, whose first choice probably was kicking customers soccer-style 
on their bare legs with hard shoes. 
</P>
<P>
On another tavern front, some guy in Nairobi wanted to watch the World Cup on 
TV in his local corner bar. The owner told the guy he had to pay. The guy 
refused. The owner told the guy he had to leave. The guy stabbed him with a 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
Well, looks like Fliegenbauer's won't be having a West Kenya branch. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Africa, and we were, our old friends the Cameroon "Indomitable 
Lions" stepped forward after two thrilling first-round victories and promptly 
got kicked around by the winless, yet not necessarily domitable, Soviet Union, 
4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us just happened to notice the interesting coincidence that the 
Soviets, who just happened to need a four-goal victory to have any chance of 
advancing into the second round, just happened to score four quick goals 
against the Cameroonians, who just happened to have a Soviet for a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Nah. We prefer the version in Cameroon Tribune: 
</P>
<P>
"The worthless victory of the USSR over the Lions" should not be taken 
seriously, the Trib reported with total and understandable objectivity. The 4-0 
defeat was nothing more than a "tactical" maneuver in order to fool the 
second-round opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and one more thing: Cameroon was forced to wear yellow shirts in the Soviet 
game. It always plays better in green shirts, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I think this could be another ploy to fool the second-round 
opponents. Cameroon should play its next game wearing white shirts with blue 
trim, thereby fooling the opponents into thinking that they are actually 
playing the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Well, if Jim McMahon can fly in an acupuncturist at the last minute to help him 
win Super Bowl XX, I suppose it's OK for Bryan Robson to fly in his faith 
healer. 
</P>
<P>
B. Robby is captain of the team from England. He has a heel injury that is 
killing him, which is worrying both Bryan and his coach, Bobby Robson, who is 
not related to Bryan and is not to be confused with anybody anywhere named 
Robby Bobson. 
</P>
<P>
To heal Bryan's heel, they sent for Olga Stringfellow. 
</P>
<P>
Stringfellow has treated several English players, and the coach is willing to 
put her faith to the test. "We are not regarding this as a last resort," Bobby 
Robson maintained, but should Olga not work out, we expect the next call to be 
to an American TV evangelist, followed by a voodoo priest from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
Rome has lifted its ban on beer and wine sales on match days, because of the 
intervention of an official from FIFA, soccer's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
The guy's heart is in the right place, as is his name: 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Blatter. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of drinking, and we were, whoa, has this World Cup ever been a 
sobering experience for Ivica Osim! 
</P>
<P>
Osim, the coach of Yugoslavia, awoke one morning to find himself portrayed as 
the tournament's most serious lush. A newspaper report out of Belgrade, picked 
up by the Italian press, charged Osim with having consumed "11 bottles of 
whiskey in one night." 
</P>
<P>
After Yugoslavia qualified for the second round, Osim walked into a news 
conference, said, "Now even in Italy they are writing I am a big drunk," then 
walked out. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and those 11 bottles of whiskey? As best we can figure, they were spotted 
near Osim's hotel door the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
The coach said they were from another guest's wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, another big story out of Belgrade the other day was headlined: 
"Hooligans Like the Italian Prisons." 
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Politika, British soccer fans, arrested for acts of 
violence and general hooliganism, were saying that "Italian prisons are like 
hotels -- you can eat, drink, watch the matches on TV and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, I heard Italian prisoners only got served garlic bread and water.

NCAA INQUIRY CENTERS ON STAGGERS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FORMER CITY PLAYER OF THE YEAR AT CRENSHAW SAYS HE RECEIVED 
PROHIBITED BENEFITS WHILE AT UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not long after John Staggers, a former Crenshaw High School basketball star, 
showed up in the Salt Lake Community College lineup a few weeks into the 
1988-89 season, the questions started coming into the National Junior College 
Athletic Assn.'s headquarters in Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Is that the same John Staggers who failed to graduate from Crenshaw? How is he 
eligible in Salt Lake City? 
</P>
<P>
Soon, NJCAA and school officials found the answer -- a high school equivalency 
(GED) certificate obtained with a fraudulent test score. 
</P>
<P>
Staggers had to leave school, and Salt Lake Community College was put on 
probation by the NJCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a year and a half later, Staggers' quest for eligibility that fall is 
being investigated again, but this time the stakes are considerably higher. The 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. is involved, and the results of its inquiry 
could affect two Division I programs, those of the University of Texas El Paso 
and Ball State University. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA is looking into how Staggers lived in El Paso in the late summer and 
early fall of 1988, while he was participating in a federally funded GED 
program -- intended for migrant farm workers and their families on the UTEP 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Staggers signed a letter of intent to play at UTEP in November 1987 but could 
not enroll the next fall because he had left Crenshaw without graduating. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP coaches have said they knew little of Staggers' living arrangements when 
he was in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
But Staggers told The Times that he has given the NCAA a signed statement 
describing free housing, meals and transportation that he says he got through 
UTEP coaches. NCAA rules forbid such benefits provided by coaches or school 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Staggers' testimony is a key part of a preliminary inquiry by the NCAA into the 
UTEP basketball program. The inquiry is expected to be completed by the end of 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The findings of the inquiry could also have an impact on Ball State, where a 
UTEP recruiter named by Staggers in his allegations, Rus Bradburd, recently 
took a job as an assistant coach. Under tougher enforcement regulations adopted 
by the NCAA four years ago, a coach cited for rules violations at one school is 
subject to penalties, such as recruiting and coaching restrictions, even if he 
moves to another school. 
</P>
<P>
Staggers left El Paso after about six weeks and turned up at Salt Lake 
Community College, where he played in five games before it was learned that a 
teammate had taken a portion of the GED test used to certify Staggers' 
eligibility. Staggers left the school when the fraudulent test result was 
discovered in December 1988, and his career has been on hold ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a young man who was used by some people," said Denny Aye, the coach at 
Columbia Community College in Calaveras County, where Staggers hopes to play in 
the fall. "It cost him a year of eligibility, got him screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-5 swingman, Staggers began his senior season at Crenshaw as one of the 
top 50 college prospects in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The only drawback was a transcript dotted with so many unexcused absences that, 
according to one college assistant coach, it "looked like a checkerboard." 
</P>
<P>
Some schools saw Staggers' transcript and backed off. UTEP didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"We just took a chance on a guy who was going to be a non-predictor (a player 
not expected to be eligible as a college freshman) all the way," UTEP Coach Don 
Haskins has said of the decision to sign Staggers. "They kind of do that all 
over the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Haskins did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
As a high school senior, Staggers was the leading scorer on the Crenshaw team 
that went 28-0 before losing in overtime to Manual Arts in the Southern 
California regional final. He was chosen City 4-A player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
After the season, however, he began paying even less attention than usual to 
his classes at Crenshaw, an attitude he now attributes to the influence of 
friends who were already out of school. By the end of the spring semester, he 
had missed too much work to get his diploma. 
</P>
<P>
"He isn't a dumb kid," said Crenshaw assistant coach Joe Weakley, who remains 
close to Staggers. "He just lacked maturity. You know what they mean when they 
say, 'Young in the mind'? That was John -- just young. He just wanted to fool 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Some close to Staggers thought he would wind up at a school in the California 
Community College system, which allows students over the age of 18 to enroll 
and compete in athletics without a high school diploma or GED certificate. 
</P>
<P>
But he went to El Paso instead. The plan -- endorsed, he said, by UTEP coaches 
-- was for him to get his GED certificate, enroll at UTEP and possibly be 
eligible to play for the Miners as early as the second half of the 1988-89 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, (UTEP coaches) wanted me to go to a junior college," he said. "And I 
was (saying), 'I don't know.' So then they said, 'OK, we'll bring you in.' Aug. 
13, they brought me in." 
</P>
<P>
Staggers said he was met at the El Paso airport by Bradburd, then a UTEP 
assistant coach, who drove him to an off-campus apartment. According to 
Staggers, Bradburd told him, "You'll be staying here." 
</P>
<P>
Staggers said he lived rent-free in the three-bedroom apartment with two UTEP 
players during his time in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Meals, he said, were often bought for him by Bradburd and G Ray Johnson, a 
graduate assistant coach at UTEP at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out (to El Paso) with money, but I never spent my money because . . . I 
didn't have to pay for anything," Staggers said. 
</P>
<P>
He had hoped to obtain his GED certificate before the beginning of the fall 
semester, but he was unable to pass the entire test, which consists of five 
parts, when he took it shortly after his arrival in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
As preparation to retake the test, he participated in UTEP's High School 
Equivalency Program, a federally funded program for migrant farm workers or 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
Staggers said he enrolled in it at the direction of UTEP coaches and got rides 
to the classes from Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Lazarin, the program's director, confirmed that Staggers got into the 
program through the arrangements of UTEP athletic department personnel but said 
Staggers was allowed only to monitor the program because he did not meet the 
criteria for enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who recently was promoted to a full-time position on the UTEP coaching 
staff, denied buying meals for Staggers or giving him rides. He said he gave a 
similar statement to an NCAA investigator who interviewed him about two months 
ago in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Bradburd, who was hired by Ball State on April 30, did not respond to repeated 
requests to be interviewed. His attorney, Roy Brandys of El Paso, declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "John's deal is a funny deal. He didn't graduate from high 
school. He was down here in that free (GED) program. He wasn't going to pass, 
and he pulled out on us." 
</P>
<P>
Staggers said he got frustrated in El Paso when UTEP coaches didn't follow 
through on a promise to find a job for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I heard Rus talking behind my back, saying, 'John's not going to be here 
any longer if he doesn't pass his GED,' " he said. "I mean, it was fine with me 
if I wasn't going to be there. They're the ones who brought me down there." 
</P>
<P>
Hurt and angry, he called a friend, Anthony January, a former Carson High 
player. January had left UTEP for Salt Lake Community College, where the 
basketball program, in only its third year, was becoming a haven for players 
with checkered pasts. Staggers wanted to know if SLCC had a place for him. 
January went to Dave Osborn, then the school's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"And the next thing you know, I had a ticket at the airport," Staggers said. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived at Salt Lake Community College in time to enroll for the fall 
quarter, but becoming eligible to play for the Bruins was another matter. Once 
again, he had to get his GED certificate, and once again, he struggled with the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
So arrangements were made for a stand-in to take those portions of the test he 
hadn't passed in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Investigations by both the school and the NJCAA, initiated when officials noted 
a dramatic improvement in Staggers' scores, did not officially implicate 
Osborn, who resigned in the midst of the NJCAA inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
But Staggers now says that the SLCC player who took the test for him, Paul 
Seeley of La Puente, told him that Osborn was behind the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Osborn, in a recent interview, denied any involvement but said that Seeley, who 
was serving as something of an unofficial tutor for his teammates, might have 
misunderstood instructions from the coaching staff to help Staggers become 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand how he could mix that up," Osborn said. "We were under a lot 
of pressure to get this kid eligible. It was a misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Seeley, who played briefly last season at Gonzaga, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
After its investigation, the NJCAA, which serves as the governing body for all 
junior colleges in the United States outside California, put Salt Lake 
Community College on a year's probation. It also ruled that Staggers, who was 
immediately suspended by the school when the fraudulent test score was 
discovered, was ineligible to play for any NJCAA school. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Gerber, the SLCC athletic director at the time, recently said of Staggers: 
"He's like a lot of young men who (haven't) figured out what life's all about. 
He didn't lie to me. When I found out about (the fraudulent test score) and 
approached him, he admitted what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, he didn't come running to tell me about it, either. He did what you 
or I would do at 18 if basketball was your whole life. The guy wanted to play 
ball. He had his eye on the NBA. To him, school is a handicap, a hindrance." 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence, however, that Staggers may be starting to take school 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Running out of options, as well as time, he enrolled last fall at Columbia 
Community College. He needed to pass 24 hours of class work with a 2.0 
grade-point average to be eligible to play, and according to Aye, he got the 
work done. 
</P>
<P>
When the Columbia Claim Jumpers begin the 1990-91 season, Staggers will, if all 
goes according to plan, be in the lineup for his first taste of formal 
competition since the GED test fraud was uncovered in Salt Lake City. And if he 
obtains an Associate of Arts degree by next spring or summer, he will be 
eligible to play two full seasons at an NCAA school. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Columbia's isolated setting, Staggers has found the school an ideal 
place to start over. 
</P>
<P>
"No distractions," he said. "It's just like a national park -- squirrels, 
deer." 
</P>
<P>
And the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by news reports quoting former UTEP players as saying they had been 
lent cars by boosters, the NCAA initiated its preliminary inquiry into the 
Miner program late last year, and it didn't take long for an enforcement 
representative to find Staggers in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Staggers said he gave a detailed account of his time in El Paso, including the 
assistance he claims to have received from Bradburd and Johnson, to the NCAA 
last fall and reviewed and signed the statement early this year. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary inquiry could, according to sources familiar with the case, be 
upgraded to an official inquiry, in which the school must reply to formal 
charges, as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry has found evidence that could lead to a variety of charges, 
according to the sources, but those involving Staggers are the most serious, in 
the NCAA's view, because, if proved, they would mean that UTEP received a 
significant recruiting advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Staggers, for one, isn't too concerned with what it all means. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told (the NCAA) what happened," he said. "I didn't lie to them." 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, he looks back at what happened to him in El Paso and 
Salt Lake City and regrets leaving Crenshaw without a diploma. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most embarrassing experience I've ever had," he said. "I thought 
I'd never go through an experience like that. I would never want to go through 
it again."

HOLLYPARK STARS OUT AT NIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: EXPERIMENT A SUCCESS AS 24,529 FANS TURN OUT FOR PROGRAM UNDER 
THE LIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

With a likeness of Robocop walking through the crowd, a Dixieland band playing 
in the grandstand and celebrities such as James Caan and Andy Williams posing 
with trainers and jockeys in the winner's circle, Hollywood Park held its first 
of four experimental night racing programs Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-race, four-hour program, which began at 7 p.m., attracted a crowd of 
24,529. A year ago, on a Friday afternoon, the crowd at the track was 11,740. 
</P>
<P>
"How many businesses can double their business, just like that?" asked Marje 
Everett, Hollywood Park's president. "We're delighted with the turnout. And you 
can tell that it's a different kind of crowd: More young people, people that 
racing will need for support years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park will have racing on three more Friday nights -- June 29, July 6 
and July 13. To get trainers to cooperate, the track said it will put up an 
extra $500,000 in purse money for the season, and promised that the night 
racing experiment would not go beyond Friday nights for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd still rather be doing this under the sun," said trainer John Russell, who 
ran a 4-year-old filly that was nosed out at the wire in the third race. "With 
these hours, I'll just show up at the barn tomorrow morning in my top hat and 
tails." 
</P>
<P>
Because of early-morning training hours, many horsemen are routinely in bed by 
10 p.m., which was the time Hollywood was running Friday night's seventh race, 
the $75,000 Star Dust Stakes. A regular schedule of night racing could result 
in added expense for extra stablehands. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Alamitos, where a quarter horse program was held Friday night, a track 
spokesman reported that the night racing at Hollywood was not going to affect 
the handle. "We're going to do about $1.2 million, the same as last Friday 
night," he said. "They're not betting as much on track, but at the off-track 
sites they're making up the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Brent Small and Jenelle Sanders, a young couple from Northridge, attended the 
races at Hollywood and said night racing would bring them to the track more 
often. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, we only come two or three times a year, because we both work in the 
daytime," Small said. "But we're planning on coming to all four of these Friday 
nights." 
</P>
<P>
Another fan, Dale Becker of Santa Ana, took refuge in the pavilion. Becker goes 
to Hollywood about 10 times a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The pavilion's not a good place to see the races, but at least it's 
comfortable," said Becker, who is in his 30s. "When they made it official after 
that photo (finish) in the third race, it was like a war zone in the 
grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
"But the track is doing the right thing by going to nights. You can bring a 
date, and it's more of an event." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, the leading rider nationally based on purse money, won three of 
the first five races, but Predecessor, his mount in the Star Dust, ran second 
as Tight Spot, under Eddie Delahoussaye, scored a two-length victory in the 1 
1/16-mile grass race for 3-year-olds. Tight Spot paid $7.20 to win. 
</P>
<P>
In the race before the Star Dust, Hat Parade, a tiring 3-year-old filly, 
stopped abruptly about 30 yards past the finish line, unseating apprentice 
jockey Carlos Navarro. The rider suffered a bruised shoulder and was sent to a 
hospital for X-rays.

TWO UNREAL MATCHUPS IN 'REAL WORLD CUP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

NAPLES, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four hours and less than 100 miles apart, two games that would seem more 
appropriate for the semifinals will be played Sunday in the most intriguing 
matchups of the World Cup's eight-game second round. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, runner-up in the last two World Cups, and 1988 European champion 
the Netherlands will meet in Milan's Giuseppe Meazza Stadium, and their contest 
will be followed by three-time champion Brazil's game against defending 
champion Argentina in Turin's Communale Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
This guarantees that two teams considered title contenders when the most 
prestigious tournament in sports began 16 days and 36 games ago will be sent 
home long before the July 8 final in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
After only eight teams were eliminated in the first round, the World Cup 
becomes serious today with the beginning of the 16-team, single-elimination 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
No ties are allowed. Teams that are even after 90 minutes of regulation 
continue with two 15-minute overtime periods. If the game remains tied, it is 
settled by penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
"The real World Cup begins now," Italian Coach Azeglio Vicini said. 
</P>
<P>
Vicini would have difficulty convincing Italians that the first two weeks were 
just for practice. Only Italy and Brazil finished the first round with three 
victories, but neither was above criticism from its demanding fans and media. 
</P>
<P>
Discouraged by Italy's lack of offense in 1-0 victories over Austria and the 
United States in the first two games, the newspapers pleaded for Vicini to 
replace scoreless forwards Gianluca Vialli and Andrea Carnevale with crowd 
favorites Salvatore Schillaci and Roberto Baggio. 
</P>
<P>
Although it must have pained him to do so in light of his agitation over the 
highly opinionated Italian press, Vicini also saw the wisdom of the changes. He 
was rewarded when Schillaci and Baggio scored in a 2-0 victory over 
Czechoslovakia that allowed Italy to remain in Rome for its second-round game 
Monday against Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first two games, Italy's supporters seemed resigned to West 
Germany's superiority. But the impressive victory over the Czechs combined with 
the West Germans' 1-1 tie against Colombia restored the Italians' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they no doubt are happy that it is not they but the Dutch who must play 
the Germans Sunday. Of 82 goals scored in the first round, 10 of them were by 
West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Two Germans who play in the Italian League, Lothar Matthaeus of Inter Milan and 
Rudy Voeller of AC Roma, each have three goals. That is one behind the 
tournament's leading scorer, Jose Miguel Gonzalez -- better known as Michel -- 
who plays for Spain, which meets Yugoslavia Tuesday in Verona. 
</P>
<P>
The player who was expected to win the Golden Boot as the leading scorer, 
Holland's Marco Van Basten, has yet to boot one into the net. Neither has 
Argentina's Diego Maradona, who led his team to the championship four years ago 
in Mexico. Consequently, their teams have struggled. 
</P>
<P>
Considered the early favorite two years ago after winning the European 
Championship with a victory in the final over the Soviet Union, the 
Netherlands' chances have deteriorated because of dissension, injuries and bad 
luck. With players threatening to revolt, the Dutch fired their coach, Thijs 
Libregts, three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Also, their inspirational midfielder, Ruud Gullit, has not fully recovered from 
a knee injury that prevented him from playing for most of the past year. On one 
good leg, he started the first-round games, scoring a goal in the third match 
against Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
They tied all three games to share second place in their group with Ireland. 
But Ireland advanced as the second-place team in a blind draw Thursday night 
and will play Monday in Genoa against Romania. The Netherlands was sent as the 
third-place team to face the Germans. The luck of the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side for the Dutch, they at least qualified for the second round. 
The Soviets did not, after losing two of three games. Almost as disappointing 
was Sweden, which lost all three games. 
</P>
<P>
Gullit found another reason for optimism. "We can't play any worse than we 
have," he said. "That's an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a quick fix for his injured players, Holland's new coach, Leo 
Beenhakker, has allowed them to import a physiotherapist-psychologist, Ted 
Troost, whose last name, in Dutch, means "solace." 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, England's injured captain, Bryan Robson, summoned a faith 
healer to assist him in getting ready for Tuesday's game in Bologna against 
Belgium, which is known at home as the Red Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Having begun the tournament with the flu and an ingrown toenail, Maradona now 
has a knee injury that he is attempting to heal by undergoing treatment, 
listening to lambada dance music and playing with his two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"Diego recovers his smile when he listens to music and plays with his 
daughters," his doctor, Fernando Signorini, said. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona lost the smile when Argentina finished 1-1-1 in the first round to 
place third in its group, setting up the game against South American rival 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil remains a favorite, but has its critics. Among the more influential is 
Pele, who is appalled because Coach Sebastano Lazarono has abandoned the 
beautiful, free-flowing offensive attack so identified with the Brazilians, in 
favor of a more conservative approach. 
</P>
<P>
Lazarono is frustrated because he believes Brazilians would rather lose pretty 
than win ugly. 
</P>
<P>
Unburdened by such high expectations -- and just happy to be in the second 
round -- are Cameroon, Colombia and Costa Rica, the high C's who have 
threatened to turn this tournament into the Third World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon were brought back to reality by a 4-0 
loss to the Soviet Union, after upset victories over Argentina and Romania, 
will be discovered today when they play Colombia in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
Cameroon could have a problem if it advances to the quarterfinals. Eleven of 
its 22 players are amateurs. Some are supposed to be back at work in their 
full-time jobs next week. 
</P>
<P>
No team is more surprised to be in the second round than Costa Rica, which beat 
Scotland and Sweden and lost by only a 1-0 score to Brazil while playing in its 
first World Cup. The Costa Ricans will play Czechoslovakia today in Bari. 
</P>
<P>
"A dream has come true," forward Juan Arnoldo Cayasso said. "But I fear for the 
people at home. I think a few of them who are very happy could have heart 
attacks." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is one of two representatives from the Central and North American 
and Caribbean region. The other was the United States, which lost all three of 
its games against European teams. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one American advanced to the second round. Referee Vincent Mauro 
of Arlington, Mass., was chosen as a linesman for Sunday's West Germany-Holland 
game.

A municipal judge dismissed misdemeanor charges against Sacramento developer 
and sports promoter Gregg Lukenbill and four others Friday in the controversial 
"Ballpark Five" election case. 
</P>
<P>
The men were indicted by a grand jury on April 3 for allegedly violating state 
election laws when Lukenbill encouraged a Marin County company to donate 
$12,500 to a campaign against a ballot proposal calling for the construction of 
a downtown baseball-only stadium in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which lost by fewer than 2,000 votes in last November's election, 
was seen as the city's last chance to prevent the National League champion 
Giants from moving to Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Phillip Moscone ruled that there was not enough evidence in the case and 
dismissed the charges. Asst. District Attorney George Beckwith said the city 
would appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
After the ballot issue's narrow defeat, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos accused 
Lukenbill of illegally trying to conceal the sources of the donation because 
the promoter wanted to lure the Giants to Sacramento.

Mike Stulce, two-time NCAA shotput champion from Texas A&amp;M, has been 
suspended for two years after tests showed him to have a testosterone level 
higher than the legal limit, The Athletics Congress announced. 
</P>
<P>
TAC, the governing body of U.S. track and field, said Stulce would appeal the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The male hormone testosterone has a tissue-building effect on the muscles. 
</P>
<P>
TAC also announced that Olympian Larry Myricks had tested positive for 
Phenylpropanolamine, a decongestant that is found in cold-relief products, at 
two European meets this year. Myricks is serving a three-month sentence for 
using the banned substance during the U.S. indoor season. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks, who said he took the medicine to combat a cold, faces a possible 
lifetime suspension.

RYAN ADJUSTS, BUT FOES DON'T

Nolan Ryan has learned to live -- and pitch -- with a stress fracture in his 
lower back. 
</P>
<P>
While learning, he pitched his sixth no-hitter recently in Oakland, but to 
remain in the regular rotation, the 43-year-old pitcher has had to take 
something off his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Dropping down to about 94 m.p.h. hasn't cut down on his strikeouts, but it has 
improved his control. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan (6-4) struck out nine and walked none in 7 1/3 innings Friday night at 
Arlington, Tex., as the Texas Rangers beat the Seattle Mariners, 5-2. Ryan, who 
won his first four starts this season before back problems took their toll, 
improved to 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan scored his 295th victory and appears certain to reach his goal of 300. He 
has missed five starting assignments, but was able to start his last three 
turns. 
</P>
<P>
When he pitched the no-hitter against the world champion Athletics, Ryan's 
14-year-old son gave him back rubs between innings. This time he managed 
without a rubdown. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you," Ryan said, "the back problem is never out of my mind. 
What I have to do is go out there and on each particular pitch block it out of 
my mind, make sure it doesn't bother me on that particular pitch. I wish I 
could honestly say that it's getting better, but I'm not really sure it is." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Oakland 0 -- The White Sox simply won't give up. After the A's won 
the last three games in Chicago last weekend, there were many who thought Jeff 
Torborg's club would fade away. 
</P>
<P>
But in the opener of this weekend series at Oakland, Dan Pasqua and Scott 
Fletcher hit home runs for the White Sox, who pulled within three games of the 
leaders of the West. 
</P>
<P>
Eric King (7-1) gave up six hits, and Oakland didn't get a runner to third 
base. King struck out nine and retired the first 10 he faced. 
</P>
<P>
King was protecting a 1-0 lead until the sixth, when the White Sox broke 
through against Scott Sanderson (8-4). Pasqua's home run made it much easier 
for the veteran right-hander, who was 9-10 with the White Sox last season. 
</P>
<P>
New York 8, Toronto 7 -- The Yankees are doing more than showing some life 
these days. They are tightening the race in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Although they blew a 6-1 lead in the eighth inning, the Yankees outlasted the 
Blue Jays in 15 innings at Toronto to win their fourth in a row. The last two 
have been against the Blue Jays, whose lead in the East is once again only a 
half-game. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Balboni hit two home runs for the Yankees, but it was an error by second 
baseman Nelson Liriano that paved the way for two unearned Yankee runs in the 
top of the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
Liriano's two-out error set the stage for rookie Mike Blowers, who singled in 
two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Righetti gave up George Bell's 15th home run leading off the bottom of the 
15th, but retired the next three batters for his 15th save. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto left-hander Jimmy Key, making his first start since he went on the 
disabled list because of a hamstring problem June 1, lasted six innings, giving 
up nine hits and five runs. He seemed a certain loser until the Blue Jays 
erupted against Dave LaPoint and the Yankee bullpen in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Baltimore 3 -- Mike Boddicker might be only the second-best Red Sox 
pitcher, but he's putting together an impressive string of victories. 
</P>
<P>
Boddicker (9-3) gave up nine hits and four walks in 8 1/3 innings, but won his 
eighth consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Pena's two-out single in the seventh inning broke a tie and Rob Murphy 
came out of the bullpen to get the last two outs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 9, Cleveland 7 -- Charlie O'Brien hit a bases-loaded triple and drove 
in four runs for the first time in a game, and Dave Parker homered for the 
Brewers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's triple keyed a five-run second inning that erased a 3-0 deficit and 
the struggling Brewers chased Bud Black (6-4) in the third when Parker hit a 
two-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians rallied late, but Dan Plesac finally got the last out when Jerry 
Browne, representing the tying run, lined out to first. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 3, Kansas City 2 -- The Twins might not win at all if they didn't 
have rookie Kevin Tapani. 
</P>
<P>
Tapani (8-4), who beat the Royals in Kansas City Sunday to end the Twins' 
nine-game losing streak, ended a four-game streak at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Tapani gave up a run and four hits in eight strong innings. Rick Aguilera gave 
up a run in the ninth, but earned his 17th save. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gaetti hit his ninth home run, his first in 13 days, for the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been around long," Tapani said, "but I know that when you go up 
against a pitcher as good as Bret Saberhagen, you'd better pitch well." 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen now is 5-7. DAN HAFNER

CANSECO SAYS NEW DEAL WITH A'S TO MAKE HIM HIGHEST-PAID PLAYER

<P>
Jose Canseco said Friday he has reached an agreement on the dollar amount of a 
long-term contract with the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Due to come off the disabled list today, Canseco met with reporters before the 
Athletics' game Friday night against the Chicago White Sox in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the two sides had agreed to a dollar amount on his contract, 
Canseco said, "Yes. It's down to minor details." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco would not comment on the specific figure or the length of the deal, but 
when asked if he would be the highest-paid player in the game, he said, "That 
should be the obvious." 
</P>
<P>
The highest-paid player in baseball currently is Don Mattingly, who has a 
$19.6-million, five-year deal with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco's representatives were asking for more than $23 million over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A's General Manager Sandy Alderson could not be reached for comment, and 
Canseco's agent, Dennis Gilbert of Beverly Hills, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Borris, who works for Gilbert, was with Canseco in Oakland Friday. Borris 
said the two sides had been negotiating while Canseco was on the disabled list. 
"They negotiated in good faith during his injury," Borris said. "That was very 
classy of them." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, 25, is currently playing with a one-year, $2 million contract. He is 
eligible to become a free agent after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
After taking batting practice Wednesday and Thursday at Oakland Coliseum, 
Canseco looked impressive Friday night, hitting more than a dozen balls deep 
into the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
"My timing is still off, but the last round I really got loose," Canseco said. 
</P>
<P>
The slugger hit 20 home runs with 50 runs batted in while batting .320 in 52 
games before being placed on the disabled list with back problems. 
</P>
<P>
He spent three nights in a hospital, where he was placed in traction, after 
checking in at the suggestion of team officials. Canseco said he's had back 
problems most of his life.

BRAVES FIRE NIXON AS MANAGER, NAME COX AS HIS REPLACEMENT

Russ Nixon was fired as manager of the last-place Atlanta Braves Friday and 
replaced by the man who gave him the news, General Manager Bobby Cox. 
</P>
<P>
"I called Russ this morning and told him it was not a good phone call," Cox 
said. "He knew what I meant. It's upsetting. When somebody fails below you, 
it's the same as if you failed." 
</P>
<P>
Cox said Nixon, under pressure since the Braves lost 13 of their first 15 games 
and 40 of their first 65, took the news calmly, adding: "He said he felt 
tremendous relief that it was all over. He had been under a lot of pressure the 
last few days." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said, from his home in Covington, Ga.: "I've been expecting it. It's been 
evident the last two weeks. One of the bullets was going to get me, they've 
been shooting so many at me." 
</P>
<P>
This is Cox's second stint as manager of the Braves in less than 10 years. Stan 
Kasten, the club president, said Cox will keep both jobs the rest of the year 
and then give up one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, in his fifth season as general manager, managed the Braves for four 
seasons in 1978-81 and managed the Toronto Blue Jays for four seasons in 
1982-85. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon was named manager of the Braves in 1988 after Chuck Tanner was fired. The 
club was 42-79 under his direction that year and 63-97 in 1989, finishing in 
last place both times. He also managed Cincinnati in 1982 and '83, when the 
Reds finished last both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon is the third manager fired this season, following Davey Johnson of the 
New York Mets and Bucky Dent of the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Kasten also said pitching coach Bruce Dal Canton will be replaced by Leo 
Mazzone, pitching coach with Atlanta's International League farm club at 
Richmond, Va. Dal Canton will replace Mazzone at Richmond.

METS ARE TURNING THINGS AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ROSENTHAL, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rats, it was too early to celebrate the demise of the New York Mets. Bud 
Harrelson is rapidly emerging as this year's Cito Gaston, a replacement manager 
in the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were 20-22 under Davey Johnson, then lost four of their first five 
under Harrelson. Before Friday night's game theyhad gone 12-3 since then, 
including 5-2 against first-place Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
No question, the Mets have responded to Harrelson's disciplined approach -- 
"everyone is more together," pitcher Dwight Gooden said -- but the fact is, 
they are finally playing like the team they profess to be. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday, they had averaged 8.42 runs in their past 12 games (all right, 
so 34 came in two days at Wrigley Field) and Darryl Strawberry was an absolute 
monster against the Pirates, hitting six homers in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, as we all know, is the key to this team. His passive start was 
attributed to his new sober lifestyle, but before Friday he was batting .390 
with 10 homers and 25 RBIs in his last 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
He is not alone: The Mets, a team built on power, have hit homers in eight 
straight games and 23 of their past 26, before Friday night's contest. Kevin 
McReynolds, another who was listless early, has hit six in his last 15 games 
before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Jefferies, moved to the No. 3 spot by Harrelson, was on a 24-for-44 tear 
before Friday. And who cares that Mike Marshall wants to be traded? His 
replacement at first base, Dave Magadan, was batting .378 before Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the season, the Mets seemed to win only on days Frank Viola pitched. 
But their only two losses in the last 12 games, before Friday, were in games 
started by Viola. 
</P>
<P>
Rats, they're back. 
</P>
<P>
Great while it lasted: The San Francisco Giants' 16-1 surge was their best in 
25 years, but for all that work the closest they got to first-place Cincinnati 
was seven games. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that they were 6-1 against last-place Atlanta during their 
hot streak, and evidence their luck might soon change came in their last two 
games, both one-run losses to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's difficult not to be impressed with the pitching staff's dramatic 
changing of the guard. Trevor Wilson and John Burkett are a combined 10-1. Last 
year's aces, Rick Reuschel and Scott Garrelts, were a combined 6-12 before 
Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark is back to himself after hitting .209 in May, Kevin Mitchell was 
batting a consistent .315 with 17 homers before Friday and Matt Williams hit 
.453 with 21 RBI during his recent 16-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
But can the Giants keep it up? Before Friday night's game they outhit their 
opponents .320-.215 and averaged 7.4 runs during their 16-1 stretch. Such 
production is fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
We love this guy: For the benefit of the media, Philadelphia pitcher Don Carman 
posted a list of the 37 greatest baseball cliches under a sign that says, "You 
saw the game. Take what you need." 
</P>
<P>
No. 1: "I'm just glad to be here. I just want to help the club any way I can." 
</P>
<P>
No. 2: "Baseball's a funny game." 
</P>
<P>
No. 3: "I'd rather be lucky than good." 
</P>
<P>
No. 4: "We're going to take this season one game at a time." 
</P>
<P>
No. 5: "You're only as good as your last game." 
</P>
<P>
The value of a bullpen I: It is difficult to ignore Cecil Fielder when talking 
about Detroit, but the Tigers' surprising success can be traced just as easily 
to its bullpen, which was 7-1 with a 1.81 ERA in 34 games before Wednesday's 
12-7 loss to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The relievers combined to allow only six hits in 8 2-3 scoreless innings in two 
prior wins over Oakland -- just what everyone expected from a group consisting 
of right-handers Mike Henneman, Lance McCullers and Edwin Nunez, and 
left-handers Paul Gibson and Jerry Don Gleaton. 
</P>
<P>
Henneman, 17-for-19 in save tries before Friday, is one of the few closers who 
routinely enters games in the eighth inning. He has pitched at least 1 2-3 
innings in seven of his last eight appearances. Gleaton is the other big story. 
He has been around since 1979, but is attempting to spend his first full season 
in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, before Friday, continued to lead the majors in homers (25) and RBI 
(63) while ranking in the American League's top 10 in batting average (.316). 
Nine of his last 10 homers have tied the score or put the Tigers ahead, but he 
wins games with base hits too -- witness his two-run single in Tuesday's 6-5 
victory over Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The value of a bullpen II: Texas is one of those clubs that always seems like 
it should be in contention, but never is. Its middle-inning relief is so bad 
this season, Manager Bobby Valentine is terrified to remove his starters. 
</P>
<P>
The bullpen includes John Barfield, who, before Friday, had pitched fewer 
innings (one-third) than Chicago White Sox infielder Steve Lyons (two) since 
joining the club May 29. And let's not forget Brad Arnsberg and Craig McMurtry, 
both of whom the Rangers released earlier this season, then re-signed. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers are eagerly awaiting the return of Gary Mielke from a blister 
problem, even though, before Friday, they had lost 11 straight games in which 
he had appeared. That's nothing: Before Friday they had lost 12 straight in 
which Jamie Moyer had appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Cold Milwaukee: The Brewers had lost 20 of their last 28 games before Friday, 
and the reasons are not that complicated: Reigning Most Valuable Player Robin 
Yount, closer Dan Plesac and No. 2 starter Chris Bosio are struggling, while 
staff ace Teddy Higuera and second baseman Paul Molitor are on the disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday, Yount was .235 with men in scoring position, compared to .367 
last year. Plesac (0-3, 6.15) had allowed 14 earned runs in his last 10 1-3 
innings before Friday. Bosio, 4-2 in his first nine starts, is 0-3 in his last 
six. 
</P>
<P>
Molitor, out four to six weeks with a broken knuckle on his left index finger, 
is on the disabled list for the 10th time since the start of Cal Ripken's 
consecutive games streak -- May 30, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Team happiness: No season is complete until Boston gets involved in a travel 
snafu. Baltimore-Washington International Airport, of all places, was the site 
of the most recent commotion, where Dwight Evans decided not to take the club's 
charter to Toronto during a 90-minute customs delay. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, complaining of a stiff back, spent the night at a hotel, and Roger 
Clemens joined him in sympathy. The two musketeers flew to Toronto the next 
day. Now club officials plan to meet with them Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We all fly together," Boston Manager Joe Morgan said. "It's been that way 
since Abner Doubleday instituted this 'juego' of ours." 
</P>
<P>
"Juego" means game in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Como se dice, spoiled brat? 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher of the week: The Orioles' Pete Harnisch threw only 84 pitches in eight 
innings in his victory over Cleveland Wednesday, but he was not the most 
efficient pitcher in the American League that night. 
</P>
<P>
Texas' Kevin Brown needed only 80 pitches to shut out Minnesota on four hits. 
He threw only 18 balls the entire night, and only seven -- seven! -- in the 
final six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing 12-2 to the Orioles May 25, Brown was 4-0 with a 1.26 ERA in five 
starts before Friday, including three straight complete games. 
</P>
<P>
Around the horn: Crisis time for Ken Griffey Jr.: Before Friday, he was batting 
.250 in June, and his inside-the-park home run Wednesday night was his first in 
101 at-bats. Despite his "slump," Griffey still was leading the American League 
before Friday with 84 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Insult to injury for Kansas City's million-dollar setup man, Mark Davis: His 
free-agent replacement in San Diego, Craig Lefferts, was 5-1 with 10 saves and 
a 1.13 ERA before Friday.

Cranes cleared away debris floating beside an Ohio River dam after the body of 
a 23rd victim of last week's flash flood was found, officials in Hannibal, 
Ohio, said. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found near the Hannibal locks and dam among the rubble of homes 
and belongings destroyed by a wall of water that rushed down the Wegee and Pipe 
creeks more than 20 miles upstream near Shadyside on June 14, authorities said. 
Boards and pieces of trees accounted for most of the rubble, which floated on a 
surface area about the size of two city blocks. The number of people listed as 
missing dropped from 11 to 10 after the body was discovered and identified.

Two hospital pharmacy workers were fired in Philadelphia after the deaths of 
three premature infants who had received an incorrectly mixed intravenous 
solution, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A potassium-rich formula caused the babies' heartbeats to drop and led to their 
deaths, said Martin Goldsmith, president of Albert Einstein Medical Center. 
"Someone picked up the wrong bottle," he said. The infants, two boys and a 
girl, were all in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. The employees' 
names were not released.

U.S. Secret Service agents have uncovered a fraud ring that allegedly was 
funneling sensitive credit information out of TRW Credit Data Division, one of 
the nation's largest credit bureaus, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Several sealed indictments have been obtained, according to the Secret Service, 
which is investigating the matter, but it was not revealed how soon the 
indictments will be made public. The ring reportedly involved a TRW employee 
who leaked credit information to outsiders. They, in turn, used the information 
to fraudulently obtain merchandise and for other illegal purposes. While both 
Secret Service and TRW officials confirmed an investigation was under way, they 
said they could not give any more details until the indictments are unsealed.

BUSH DECLARES WAR ON THRIFT FRAUD; DEMOCRATS SCOFF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With congressional Democrats trying to tar him with the savings and loan 
crisis, President Bush convened a rally of 88 U.S. attorneys Friday and 
declared war on S&amp;L fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not rest until the cheats and the chiselers and the charlatans spend a 
large chunk of their lives" behind bars, Bush told the prosecutors, brought in 
from across the country for a one-day meeting on S&amp;L fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"It is your sacred duty to right these wrongs, to stand up for the vulnerable 
against the unscrupulous, the guileless against the conniving," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush endorsed legislation that would authorize wiretapping in investigations of 
bank fraud and related offenses; reduce barriers to restitution for victims of 
financial fraud, and permit lawyers, investigators and accountants from 
elsewhere in government to be assigned to the Justice Department's drive 
against fraud at financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Bush's speech, six Democratic senators accused him of staging 
an elaborate "photo opportunity" and rehashing old proposals to escape blame 
for the debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) contended that the President merely "re-announced" the 
same program for a 27-city drive against fraud that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
unveiled Dec. 7 in a four-page press release. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely devastating that the President is warming over this proposal," 
Wirth told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The partisan bickering over S&amp;L prosecutions moved to the Senate floor when 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) charged that Democrats had launched "a 
carefully orchestrated political attack" against the President on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first 30-second spot of the 1990 campaign," he said, before declaring 
that the Democratic-controlled Congress is responsible for the crisis. "While 
Congress was snoozing, the American taxpayers were losing," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
The clashing rhetoric illustrated that both parties have seized on the savings 
and loan crisis as a potentially prime issue with congressional elections only 
five months away. 
</P>
<P>
Although they covered old ground to some extent, the speech by Bush and related 
announcements by Thornburgh and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who 
shared the platform with the President, included several new elements. The new 
moves, which do not require legislative authorization and will take effect in 
the near future, will: 
</P>
<P>
* Form "rapid response teams" of attorneys and auditors drawn from five 
government agencies to move against criminal activities in financial 
institutions. Bush said that the teams would be made up of "razor-sharp 
prosecutors and auditors . . . that will jump right into the paper chase . . . 
that will hit the trail while that trail is still hot." 
</P>
<P>
* Elevate the fight against S&amp;L fraud by establishing a special counsel to 
coordinate investigations and prosecutions and report to the deputy attorney 
general. The special counsel will be backed up by a unit in the deputy attorney 
general's office that will coordinate the full range of law enforcement, 
prohibition, damage and restitution actions. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish a senior interagency group to pinpoint the most significant S&amp;L 
and bank fraud cases -- those involving high losses, potential insider fraud 
and weakening of a financial institution -- to focus investigative and 
prosecutorial resources on them. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative proposals endorsed by Bush included some pending measures as 
well as some proposals that have not yet been introduced. However, the 
Administration plans to combine them into a single proposed amendment to an 
omnibus crime bill currently under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the U.S. attorneys attending the Justice Department meeting 
indicated in interviews that they had needs other than the new S&amp;L rapid 
response teams of auditors and attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Brosio, acting U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, for example, said that his 
greatest need is for additional experienced FBI agents to conduct the complex 
investigations required to counteract S&amp;L fraud. But efforts to add such 
agents are hampered by the lack of a pay differential to offset the high cost 
of living in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Very substantial numbers (of additional agents) will be required to handle the 
vast number of S&amp;L cases of $500,000 on up," Brosio said. 
</P>
<P>
The usefulness of expanding court-authorized wiretapping to cover S&amp;L and 
other financial institution fraud also was questioned by several prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Collins, U.S. attorney for the Dallas-Ft. Worth region that is the 
current focal point of the Justice Department effort against S&amp;L fraud, 
said he had not seen a case in which wiretapping would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
Collins and other prosecutors noted that the S&amp;L fraud investigations are 
"historical" rather than "ongoing criminal activity" inquiries, limiting the 
need for wiretapping.

DU PONT SAYS 4 PLANTS TO TARGET OZONE EROSION

<P>
Du Pont Co. has authorized money to develop four production facilities for its 
line of non-ozone depleting alternatives to chloroflourocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
The plants -- in Corpus Christi, Texas; Louisville, Ky.; Dordrecht, the 
Netherlands, and Chiba, Japan -- will be operational between 1992 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The company didn't say how much their construction would cost. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont executives said the plants will be capable of producing more than 140 
million pounds of hydrofluorocarbons annually -- enough to supply most 
worldwide refrigeration needs through the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The HCFCs would be produced for automobile air conditioners, appliances and 
commercial refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
"These commercial facilities would be among the first to produce world-scale 
quantities of non-ozone-depleting alternatives," said Joseph Glas, director of 
Du Pont's Freon Products division. 
</P>
<P>
Including the $240 million that it invested through 1990, the company said, its 
total investment to commercialize CFC alternatives will top $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Du Pont announced that it would stop production of CFCs by the end of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilmington chemical and fibers company has 10 facilities operating or under 
construction for the production of hydrofluorocarbons. Later this year, three 
facilities will begin operation in Corpus Christi; Maitland, Ontario, and 
Humberside, England. 
</P>
<P>
"Du Pont is working very closely with its customers during the transition, 
particularly since the substitutes are not drop-in replacements, and companies 
will have to modify and redesign equipment to use them," Glas said. 
</P>
<P>
HCFCs are expected to be able to replace 30% of current CFC uses. The 
alternatives have on average 95% less ozone depletion potential than CFCs.

The plan will require a $750,000 investment. The Newspaper Guild filed a 
complaint last year after numerous Bee editorial staffers suffered wrist, arm 
and shoulder injuries resulting from their work at video display terminals. The

DREXEL AIDE'S SENTENCE FOR LYING REDUCED; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: LISA JONES WAS CONVICTED IN MARCH, 1989, OF SEVEN COUNTS OF 
PERJURY IN FRONT OF A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATING THE BROKERAGE.

Lisa A. Jones, a teen-age runaway who became a $100,000-a-year trading 
assistant at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., got a reduction Friday in the 
sentence she received for lying to a grand jury investigating Wall Street 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand reduced his original 18-month prison 
sentence to 10 months after an appeals court threw out the longer term on 
grounds that it was stiffer than mandated by federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Sand also fined Jones $25,000 and ordered her to pay $14,850 for the cost of 
her incarceration. In addition, he required her to receive mental health 
treatment during her term. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the original sentence violated 
guidelines that govern crimes occurring after January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 27, was convicted in March, 1989, of seven counts of perjury and 
obstruction of justice for lying in January, 1988, to a federal grand jury 
investigating trading activities at Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Sand said he was sympathetic to Jones' psychological problems and troubled 
childhood -- she ran away from home at 14 -- but said deterrence was necessary 
because she lied repeatedly to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' behavior was "not a sudden impulse," the judge said. "It was a 
persistent conduct of perjury on several occasions, despite warnings" from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who worked at Drexel's Beverly Hills junk- bond department, was the 
first person convicted in the government's lengthy investigation of fraud on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
She was an assistant to Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg, who was convicted in 
the Princeton-Newport case and sentenced to three months in prison. She was not 
charged with violating securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Jones sobbed throughout the sentencing and afterward was hugged by three 
friends, including Newberg's wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing takes away this agony for very long," she said in a letter to the 
judge. "I live each day in the totality of my crisis. There are never-ending 
sleepless nights and days full of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been shattered and humiliated," she wrote. "I don't even know where to 
begin to try to rebuild my life." 
</P>
<P>
Jones is to surrender to federal authorities by July 23 to begin her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
She must spend five months at a minimum-security prison camp in Phoenix before 
becoming eligible for transfer to a halfway house in Los Angeles or to home 
detention.

Elsie the Cow Is Back: It has been more than two decades since Elsie the Cow 
appeared in a TV commercial for Borden dairy products. But this week, an 
animated version of the friendly cow once again appears in TV ads to remind 
consumers, "If it's Borden, it's got to be good." Baer Animation, the same 
Studio City company that did the animation for the film "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit?" created the animation for the commercial. "With the return of 
traditional values and emphasis on good nutrition, we feel it's time for a new 
generation to come to know the almost human cow," said John Rutan, director of 
marketing at Borden, Inc.

A DISCORDANT NOTE IN MARIACHI STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY PERFORMERS DISAGREE ON THE ROLE OF 
MARIACHI. THE 'YOUNGER' APPROACH TO MARIACHI ADAPTS TO CLASSICAL, POP OR JAZZ. 
</P>

The headliners of Sunday's Mariachi USA Festival at the Hollywood Bowl are 
Linda Ronstadt and Vikki Carr. But beneath the star billing, the lineup of 
mariachi groups will represent a less glamorous but far more controversial 
subtext: a simmering dispute between traditional and contemporary mariachi 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's listeners will have ample opportunity to make up their own minds. The 
first mariachi festival to be held at the Bowl and the largest mariachi 
festival ever held in the United States, according to promoter Rodri J. 
Rodriguez, the 6 p.m. concert will feature Mariachi El Sol de Mexico, Mariachi 
Los Camperos, Mariachi Vargas De Tecalitlan and Mariachi Los Galleros, in 
addition to Ronstadt and Carr. 
</P>
<P>
From a visual and instrumental point of view, there's little sign of conflict. 
The colorful attire, the unusual combination of trumpets, violins and guitars, 
the foot-tapping rhythms will be as familiar as ever. But if Jose Hernandez of 
Mariachi El Sol de Mexico decides to launch into his unique interpretation of 
"New York, New York," the new wave of energy in the century-old music will be 
more than obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot to be done yet with mariachi music," explains Hernandez. "Others 
say it's not mariachi if you do pop songs, but I don't agree. There's a younger 
crowd out there for our music now, and they want to hear younger music." 
</P>
<P>
For Hernandez, "younger music" might mean anything from singing Paul 
McCartney's "Yesterday" in English to rapping in Spanish -- all with mariachi 
accompaniment. A few weeks ago, his group did a fund-raiser with the 
accompaniment of a 35-piece orchestra, and they have performed with Ronstadt 
and Willie Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"Mariachi can adapt to classical," says Hernandez. "It can adapt to pop or to 
jazz. It can adapt to any kind of music." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez feels that traditional mariachi, as well, can be improved by a more 
"contemporary" approach. 
</P>
<P>
"When we do traditional songs," he explains, "I like to dress them up. I feel 
that when people hear the same songs played over and over again in the same 
arrangements, they want to hear something different. So when they listen to my 
group playing traditional songs, they hear a new, different arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez's view of mariachi will not go unchallenged in Sunday's Bowl concert. 
Nati Cano, leader of Mariachi Los Camperos, approaches the music from a 
considerably different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think," says Cano, "that most of the people who are coming to the 
Hollywood Bowl are coming to hear pop music -- or the lambada. I think they're 
coming to hear traditional mariachi music. 
</P>
<P>
"And what's wrong with that? Mariachi has a treasure of music that hasn't even 
been explored yet. Every little Mexican town is full of wonderful songs. You 
hear them every night when the people get together to make music. To me, that's 
what real mariachi is all about. That's what keeps it alive -- traditional 
music, not pop music." 
</P>
<P>
Cano, who has led a mariachi band for 27 years, has taken his traditionally 
oriented groups everywhere from Mexico City and Las Vegas to Carnegie Hall and 
the "Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
He points out that contemporary techniques have been tried before with mariachi 
music. "Back in the '50s in Mexico, we sometimes added mambo and cha cha cha, 
just to keep working. But that wasn't real mariachi." 
</P>
<P>
Mariachi variations have also surfaced in American pop music from time to time 
-- with considerable commercial success in the case of Herb Alpert's Tijuana 
Brass. Other aspects of the style have been used -- generally with atmospheric 
intent -- by the Amazing Rhythm Aces ("Third Rate Romance, Low Rent 
Rendezvous"), Maria Muldaur ("Say You Will") and Hoyt Axton ("The No No Song"). 
</P>
<P>
"We all want to please our audiences 100%, of course," Cano explains. "But 
sometimes it's a mistake to try to please everybody. Once, when we were playing 
in Las Vegas, we sang something in English. Some people came up after the show 
and said, 'Don't do that. If we want to hear American songs, we'll go see 
another show. We came to hear your music.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, born and bred in Los Angeles, feels that his contemporary mariachi 
is precisely that -- his music. Like Cano and many other mariachi leaders, he 
comes from a long line of mariachi musicians. But his own training has been far 
more extensive than the usual father-to-son assimilation of songs, music and 
lore. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in L.A.," he says. "I played in the high school marching band and 
the jazz band. After I graduated I studied film scoring, composing and 
arranging. A lot of that background has influenced my music, and I guess that's 
why my ideas are a little more on the modern side. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional mariachi is fine," Hernandez concludes. "But this approach feels 
natural to me -- and my group is me. I'm not adding all these contemporary 
elements just to attract a lot of attention. I do it because I feel it's what's 
right for mariachi. To me, there's no limit to what mariachi can do." 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with modern music," counters Cano. "But it's not for 
mariachi. We can make it better, and we should. But we shouldn't lose the 
traditional values when we do it. The success of Linda Ronstadt's mariachi tour 
-- which was very traditional -- proves that the old music is still very much 
alive."

RICK DU BROW: NEW FALL SERIES: GOOD TASTE IS IN BAD TROUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: AN INFORMAL SURVEY OF PILOTS FOR THE FALL SEASON SHOWS THAT THE 
NETWORKS HAVE PLUNGED DEEPER INTO SEXUAL INNUENDO AND FOUL LANGUAGE.

Taste. 
</P>
<P>
You remember taste. Webster defines it as appreciating things that are 
"beautiful, appropriate or harmonious." 
</P>
<P>
I've spent much of this week watching 15 pilots of the networks' new, fall TV 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Don't laugh. What's taste got to do with it, right? TV has created a nation of 
cynics. 
</P>
<P>
But now comes an even further, stomach-turning plunge -- clues that there is no 
limit to TV's ability to cheapen our lives with bad taste from bankrupt 
imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
You may or may not, for instance, like a new ABC sitcom called "Married 
People," about three couples who live in a New York brownstone. 
</P>
<P>
But what could possibly have possessed those in charge to end a harmless 
episode by having the woman landlord tell her amiable husband, "You're a lying 
son of a bitch, but I love you"? 
</P>
<P>
It's a long way until the fall premiere, and maybe this totally pointless 
prime-time shock treatment won't wind up on the air. Believe me, the show 
wouldn't lose anything without it. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking censorship here. Let ABC put it on if it wishes. It'll only 
expose the lack of creative juices -- and all the networks' increasingly 
visible reliance on casual, gratuitous, foul language as they desperately try 
to match new TV alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any point besides titillation, one may ask, when a detective in NBC's 
new "Law and Order" series makes a wisecrack about male genitals? 
</P>
<P>
Freedom of expression, of course, makes it imperative to defend the rights of 
creators of even the most obnoxious and inappropriate material. 
</P>
<P>
But we also have the right to tell the worst offenders that we're wise to what 
they're up to -- and that we know the difference between the slime they're 
offering us and the legitimately frank language and subjects presented on such 
shows as "L.A. Law" and "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
NBC is showing some tawdry clips of a new musical comedy series called "Hull 
St. High," which include a female student asking a boy to photograph her nude. 
The series is scheduled for the 7-8 p.m. Sunday slot that supposedly is 
reserved for family programs such as ABC's "Life Goes On" and public service 
shows like "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
This is all tricky territory. We're at a moment when censorship has been 
attempted against the rap group 2 Live Crew and the Cincinnati photographic 
exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe, which depicted nudity and sex. And professional 
watchdogs like the Rev. Donald Wildmon are on the prowl. 
</P>
<P>
But it's just dead wrong to let TV con artists -- and their trash -- ride the 
coattails of hard-earned freedom of expression into our living rooms without at 
least letting them know that we're not buying. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, a phenomenal documentary called "Scared Straight" showed real New 
Jersey convicts using a torrent of the strongest four-letter words -- in prime 
time -- to frighten visiting wayward youngsters about the horrors of prison 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The program made history on KTLA Channel 5 and around the nation, the language 
was perfectly justified for the circumstances and the public recognized that 
fact and agreed. Remarkably, hardly anyone complained. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, another Los Angeles station, KCOP Channel 13, also broke ground by 
presenting, unedited and in prime time, the film "The Deer Hunter" -- with all 
its four-letter dialogue. Again, an increasingly sophisticated public, aware of 
new freedoms in the arts, made relatively little fuss about this TV benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the premiere episode of "L.A. Law" illustrated network breakthroughs 
as well when an investigator, describing a cheating husband and his woman 
companion, said they were "engaged in a sex act usually described in a 
two-digit number." 
</P>
<P>
Dialogue like that, on a major and respected drama, helped open the door to 
TV's low-rent writers and producers. Encouraged by networks panicky about 
shrinking audiences, they now have flooded prime time with non-stop, 
snickering, skin-crawling sexual innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
And when a series like Fox's raucously low-brow and innuendo-prone "Married . . 
. With Children" ranks No. 4 among all shows in America, as it did last week, 
the floodgates open wider. 
</P>
<P>
You have to wonder, for instance, why, in this age of dangerous gay-bashing, 
NBC's pilot for a family sitcom called "The Fanelli Boys" has one of the 
principal characters tossing around the derogatory term "queers." 
</P>
<P>
It's socially offensive, and it's a matter of taste. 
</P>
<P>
Over on Fox, there's "Babes," a half-hour sitcom that deals with three 
heavyweight sisters and is devoted to the premise that fat is beautiful. It 
might well be a hit, and yet the absorption with bedroom innuendo -- low-brow 
and not sophisticated enough to be genuinely bawdy -- is again lacking in 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
"Babes" is also on during the 8-9 p.m. period aimed at kids. And while kids 
know all about the words and innuendo already -- probably more than parents 
think they do -- the various new series targeted at them in this key time slot 
figure to get close critical attention. 
</P>
<P>
At least one CBS sitcom, "Uncle Buck," already is being revamped after reports 
that it was extremely racy for an 8 p.m. kids' show, a network spokesman 
confirms. A CBS statement acknowledged that "some changes were being made," but 
declined to specify what they were. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduling wholesome 8 p.m. shows is a nightmare for programmers in the age of 
MTV, pay-TV films and VCRs -- all of which are available at the same time and 
have basically destroyed the notion of what an 8 p.m. network series should be. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the reason for networks trying to spice up their shows to keep up with the 
sexuality of MTV videos and the rest of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The new world actually moved in on TV a long time ago -- "Laugh-In" was an 8 
p.m. series as far back as 1968, tackling social values with a brilliant comedy 
concept. And after-hours series such as "Saturday Night Live," "The Tonight 
Show" and "Late Night with David Letterman" opened the door to today's franker 
TV outlook even more. 
</P>
<P>
All those years of fighting the good fight for more adult TV were finally 
paying off. But then came the arbitrary and pointless excesses. One's head 
turned, for instance, when the word "bastard" popped up a few years ago in CBS' 
comic miniseries, "Fresno." It's not such an uncommon word in prime time 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
It was not so long ago that Arsenio Hall used the expression "Kiss my a--" on 
his syndicated show. Now and then, the term "p----- off" is heard as one zaps 
along. One needn't be a prude to conclude that this is not raising the level of 
television or its viewers, especially young ones. 
</P>
<P>
As a friend of ours says, "There are standards." And if there aren't, then 
we're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
With a new fall season coming up, the networks would do well to watch their 
language, to be less promiscuous with innuendo as kids sit down for their 
nightly fix of television. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot at stake: the cheapening of America.

JACK MATHEWS: WHEN IS TOO MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH?; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: SATURATION SELLING MAY NOT MAKE PEOPLE RUSH TO SEE 'DICK TRACY.' THE 
INDEPENDENT FILM 'TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES' HAD A BETTER OPENING WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
I had a dream this week. I dreamed that as I was driving to work downtown, down 
Main Street through Reaganville, I spotted a tall man in a yellow raincoat and 
yellow fedora walking among the homeless handing out "Dick Tracy" T-shirts and 
telling everybody to be sure to watch him that night on "The Larry King Show." 
</P>
<P>
"Warren? Warren? Is that you?" 
</P>
<P>
Who can explain a dream? Perhaps it was just my subconscious trying to cleanse 
itself of the overload of "Dick Tracy" hype, or trying to come to grips with 
the Walt Disney Studios' dubious boast that 100% of Americans were aware of 
Warren Beatty's new film before it opened. As my father told me a long time 
ago, be wary of round figures. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the actual pre-opening awareness on "Dick Tracy," it was high. Disney 
spent an estimated jillion dollars launching the film, and the once press-shy 
Beatty -- like a reformed celibate making up for lost time -- has given himself 
over to every talk show that would have him. He may not appear downtown, but if 
you see someone who looks like him selling zircon-studded dog collars on one of 
those cable shopping shows, don't be surprised. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been a pretty sight. In person and off the air, Beatty is an 
engaging conversationalist who has lots to say. In person and on the air, he is 
a steamed clam. It's hard to know how his halting manner on these shows will 
make people want to rush out to see him in the role of the Sunday funnies' 
toughest crime fighter -- especially when his laid-back performance has been 
the most criticized element of the movie -- but nobody can accuse him of not 
being a good sport. 
</P>
<P>
This is the weekend that will determine how well the Beatty Tour has really 
worked. The film's $22.5-million opening weekend gross was good, but not great, 
and if business doesn't pick up now that school is out across the land, there 
is little chance of it becoming a hit even in the range of Disney's recent 
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" ($130 million), "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" ($153 
million) or the still-hustling "Pretty Woman" ($139 million). 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with print journalists, where red lights flicker on tape 
recorders instead of cameras, Beatty has gone on at length about his distaste 
for box-office reporting in the mass media. His point is that by ranking films 
by their popular success, we not only demean those that are not intended for 
broad audiences, but we actually generate business for bad movies. 
</P>
<P>
It's something to consider but, at the same time, there is irony aplenty in his 
saying this while working for a studio that is reaping a fortune from "Pretty 
Woman," a successful bad movie if there ever was one. Imagine someone 
suggesting a modern fairy tale featuring Sleeping Beauty as a gum-gnashing 
streetwalker and her Prince Charming as a ruthless corporate raider who pays 
$3,000 to make love in the spa of his penthouse suite in the Beverly Wilshire 
Hotel. Hey, kiss a frog, you never know. 
</P>
<P>
When I tried to describe "Pretty Woman" to a friend before it opened, she said 
"It sounds like a pre-AIDS movie." Pre-AIDS? It's pre-dirty feet. It makes 
Hollywood Boulevard look like the yellow brick road. 
</P>
<P>
So hand it to the Disney executives who saw the charm in a tale of two societal 
losers turning a simple sexual arrangement into true love and exploring their 
humanity together. And give them credit for successfully opening it as a 
romantic comedy, then continuing to spend the ad money necessary to maintain 
its standing on the box-office chart where -- by Beatty's reckoning -- its very 
presence would guarantee even more business. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty Woman" is not the only bad movie out there making money. In fact, all 
you have to do is check the chart: "Total Recall," "Another 48 HRS.," "Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles," "Bird on a Wire." Some people would even include "Dick 
Tracy" in that list. Despite the studio's clever ad campaign, which positions 
"Dick Tracy" as the best-reviewed movie of the year, the reaction has been far 
from unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, Beatty is guilty of protesting too much about the media's 
reporting of box-office receipts; at worst, he's decided to throw in with the 
varmints. Certainly, the exploitation of his celebrity has been almost 
unprecedented. It's like Marlon Brando showing up on "Hollywood Squares." 
</P>
<P>
The Times, of course, has not been immune to the seduction of Disney's "Dick 
Tracy" promotion. I interviewed Beatty and wrote 100 inches about the 
encounter. The saving grace is that I interviewed him way before he put on his 
fedora and took the show on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the effectiveness of the saturation campaign is much in doubt. Vastly 
more people knew about "Dick Tracy" before it opened than those who knew about 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," yet the independent "Turtles" had a 
higher-grossing opening weekend during a traditionally slower season. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever "Dick Tracy" eventually earns, Disney won't be able to blame Beatty. 
Having sat out the selling of his last two films -- "Reds" and "Ishtar" -- the 
star has answered the call. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine that months ago someone at Disney seriously believed that 
Beatty would agree to hock publicity as eagerly as that guy in their "Ernest" 
movies, but it sure didn't hurt to ask. Hey, kiss a frog, you never know.

HUGH SOUTHERN, GM OF THE MET, RESIGNS

In a mysterious move that stunned the music world Friday, Hugh Southern, 
general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, abruptly resigned his post for 
unexplained reasons effective July 1. Southern, 58, a former official of the 
National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, had held the position only since 
November. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been reluctant to make such a choice, but I have become aware over the 
course of the season that I have not found fulfillment at the Met," Southern 
stated in a press release. "I, therefore, felt it would not be fair or 
productive to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gilbert W. Humphrey, president of the Met Board of Directors, responded: 
"We are very sorry he will not be continuing, but we understand his feelings 
and wish him well in his endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
Southern was unavailable for further comment, but an official of the company 
who requested anonymity said, "There were some actions which he (Southern) took 
that the board did not like. A settlement of the contract was made after 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Coming to the Met last fall, Southern brought credentials that included 14 
years as executive director of the Theater Development Fund in New York City, 
and a background in theater production. Like ad executive and former Met 
general manager Bruce Crawford before him, Southern was seen as a top manager 
who could oversee financial matters while artistic director James Levine took 
the lead in aesthetic decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Southern, a native of England who won the Met job despite being a dark horse 
candidate, was paid a reported yearly salary of $350,000 for a three-year 
contract. He succeeded Crawford, former head of the advertising firm of 
BBD&amp;O, who left the Met to become chief executive officer of Omnicom. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, in his three years as head of the Met, the nation's largest opera 
company, was credited by many with bringing financial stability to the company. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication when a new general manager might be appointed.

RESPONSE TO ROBERTSON'S PLEA TO END ARTS FUNDING IS MIXED; 
</P>
<P>
ENDOWMENT: OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS TAKE A MORE MODERATE APPROACH TO PORNOGRAPHY 
AND FREEDOM-OF-EXPRESSION ISSUES. 
</P>

<P>
Television broadcaster Pat Robertson's call this week for the end of federal 
funding of the National Endowment for the Arts is not being followed en masse 
by other religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Although some religious groups support bans that would prohibit the publicly 
funded endowment from spending federal money on what they consider obscene and 
pornographic art, few favor outright bans. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not oppose NEA funding," said Robert Dugan, a spokesman for the National 
Assn. of Evangelicals, which represents about 55,000 churches and more than 44 
denominations. "We would not go that far." 
</P>
<P>
However, echoing the sentiments of some other religious leaders, he quickly 
added: "We do not think that taxpayers should be forced to fund salacious and 
sacrilegious art." 
</P>
<P>
Some religious organizations are torn between fundamental beliefs against 
pornography and obscenity and a desire to protect freedom of speech and 
expression, on which they are dependent. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jewish community has always been protective of freedom of speech and is 
very wary of censorship of any kind," said Rabbi Moshe Rothblum, past president 
of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles' Board of Rabbis. "When 
you start tinkering with freedom, whether it is artistic or religious freedom, 
it can be very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
But some are willing to join Robertson's cause. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the full amount of money that now goes to the NEA should go to more 
worthy projects like famine relief," said Dennis Jerrard, chairman of the Roman 
Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles' Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. 
"There is some feeling out there that the entire NEA should just be abolished 
and that that would solve the whole problem." 
</P>
<P>
Most religious denominations have historically been hesitant to take stands 
that would blur the line between church and state, said John Crossley, a USC 
religion professor. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the morality of something, there is a notion that religion 
should not be capable of dictating to the state," Crossley said. "Unless there 
is overwhelming demonstrated evidence that allowing something to continue will 
have a horrendous effect on the whole body politic then the feeling has always 
been to stay out." 
</P>
<P>
While there is no consensus among religious groups, any perceived push by the 
religious community could help bolster one side of a growing national debate. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, including Rep. Paul B. Henry (R-Mich.), Rep. E. Thomas Coleman 
(R-Mo.) and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), are pushing legislation that would 
tie the endowment's appropriations to specific standards regarding the kind of 
art the group could support. But Robertson would go even further. 
</P>
<P>
The former presidential candidate and founder of the 700 Club television 
ministry wants to stop all federal funding. The endowment's budget for 1990 is 
about $171 million, all from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson announced this week that the Christian Coalition, formed in May to 
help train conservative Christians how to shape government policy, plans to 
spend $200,000 for anti-NEA advertisements in newspapers and on the radio. At 
the same time, it will encourage supporters to raise additional money to place 
the ad in their local papers. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, addressed as an open letter to Congress, ran in the Washington Post on 
Wednesday and described some of the art the coalition opposes: depictions of 
naked children, Jesus shooting drugs into his arm and men engaged in homosexual 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
The ad asks politicians: "Do you want to face the voters with the charge that 
you are wasting their hard-earned money to promote sodomy, child pornography 
and attacks on Jesus Christ?" 
</P>
<P>
It also says that voters are "furious at being forced by you to pay for the 
greed of savings and loan manipulators, disgusted with your handling of your 
pay raise and discouraged at your inability to balance the federal budget." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Reed, vice president of the Christian Coalition, said the ad will run 
next week in USA Today and local papers around the country. "We see this as an 
issue of sponsorship, not censorship," Reed said. "The question is not whether 
someone has the right to produce obscene art, but whether tax dollars should be 
used to fund it." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of some religious groups, including the National Council of Churches, 
the United Methodist Church and the U.S. Catholic Conference, said they had no 
official position on funding for the NEA. These organizations meet regularly to 
discuss religious, public policy and social issues and usually do not take a 
stand on subjects that they have not discussed at these forums. 
</P>
<P>
"Our official positions don't cover flag burning or the NEA this week," 
explained Kay Dowhower, director of the office of governmental affairs for the 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. "There are other issues that have more 
impact and long-term significance . . . immigration issues, civil rights, 
violations in Central America. We are not likely to jump on the bandwagon just 
because a particular issue is making headlines." 
</P>
<P>
NEA officials refused to comment on the ad. "They just don't want to get in the 
middle of this," said spokesman Josh Dare. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA has been embroiled in an emotional debate over federal funding of the 
arts and freedom of expression since June, 1989, when it awarded grants for an 
exhibit of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe depicting homoerotic images and 
an exhibit that included an Andres Serrano photograph of a crucifix submerged 
in urine. 
</P>
<P>
Strong opinions have been expressed on both sides of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Woodall, a board member of National IMPACT, a coalition of Protestant and 
Jewish organizations, said her group does not support a ban on the NEA, nor 
does it support restricting in any way the ability to award grants to artists 
based on subject content. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in our group supports pornography," Woodall said. "But banning or 
restricting the NEA is simply wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But an official of Focus on the Family, said the Pomona-based organization of 
Christian psychologist and broadcaster James C. Dobson supports some restraint 
on the content of publicly funded art. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not against the NEA, but we are against using tax dollars to fund 
obscenity and hard-core pornography through the auspices of the NEA," said Paul 
Hetrick, a vice president of the group, which gained some attention after 
Dobson had a jailhouse interview with convicted mass murderer Ted Bundy early 
last year. Bundy told Dobson that pornography led to his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"The NEA appears to be taking the position that they will continue to fund 
obscene art," Hetrick said. "They can't do that and not expect to face some 
type of backlash."

American parents need "all the help they can get," warns a group of Jewish and 
Catholic leaders in a joint report calling for a broad-based campaign to 
instill traditional and fundamental moral values in youths attending the 
nation's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Warning that the country is on the verge of losing a generation of its 
children, the report calls for mobilizing parents with government, religious 
and educational leaders to spearhead the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Public schools "feel inhibited" about teaching such common moral values as 
honesty, compassion, tolerance and loyalty that weave together both the 
religious and civic fabric of American society, charges the report, "A Lesson 
of Value: A Joint Statement of Moral Education in the Public Schools." 
</P>
<P>
The 1,150-word document was released Tuesday by the Interreligious Affairs 
Committee of the Synagogue Council of America and the Committee for Ecumenical 
and Interreligious Affairs of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Reformed Church in America has launched a program that calls for creation 
of 98 new congregations by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
The program, called "98 by 98," was adopted at the 200,000-member 
denomination's 1990 General Synod, which just met. 
</P>
<P>
According to a summary of General Synod actions provided by the church, the 
plan calls on the denomination's seven regional synods to continue to take 
primary responsibility for establishing churches within their boundaries, while 
the national church initiates a campaign to raise $5 million for a church 
building fund. 
</P>
<P>
The General Synod also adopted a statement calling the practice of homosexual 
lifestyles "contrary to Scripture," while "encouraging love and sensitivity 
toward such persons as fellow human beings."

HUDDLING WITH GM AND AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL TANTON, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no better way to get up to date on the National Football League than 
to spend a couple hours with two astute insiders. 
</P>
<P>
George Young and Tony Agnone are such men. Lunch with them Thursday was a 
combination debate, seminar and comedy hour. 
</P>
<P>
Young is the general manager of the New York Giants. Agnone is now an agent for 
a stable of NFL players. 
</P>
<P>
Though agents and general managers are not supposed to get along, Agnone and 
Young somehow have remained good friends. Agnone represents two of Young's 
players -- Sean Landeta and Dave Meggett -- both of Towson State. Despite that, 
the Giants' general manager will be a guest at Agnone's wedding next week. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation started with the usual general manager vs. agent rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
"Free agency would kill our business," Young said. "The players are getting all 
the money now." 
</P>
<P>
"Free agency is what America is all about," Agnone said. "Each team is getting 
$32 million a year from TV." 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-six," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-two," repeated Agnone. "It's 26 now, but it goes up to 39 in the last 
year of the contract. The average is $32 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
The agent said that the NFL needs a CBA. At first, it seemed as if he meant 
that pro football needed to work with the Continental Basketball Assn., perhaps 
to sign some of its players as defensive backs. But CBA stands for collective 
bargaining agreement, which the NFL and its players have been without since the 
strike of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need a CBA as much as Tony thinks we do," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, let them fight that out. What some people really want to talk about 
is what chance their city has of getting an expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"The expansion committee met last Friday and seven of the eight members 
attended. (Philadelphia Eagle owner) Norman Braman was in Europe. That's a good 
turnout. I hear they had a good meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Said Agnone: "Baltimore will go in in the next expansion, when the league takes 
in four teams." 
</P>
<P>
"Two," Young said. "The league doesn't want to cut up the television money 32 
ways. It doesn't even like the idea of cutting it up 30 ways." 
</P>
<P>
"The fee for each franchise will be 80, 90 or $100 million," Agnone said. 
"That's why the owners will take in four. I think it'll be Memphis, with Mike 
Lynn going there to be part-owner and run the team; St. Louis, the Carolinas 
and Baltimore. Oakland you don't know about because nobody knows where the 
Raiders are going to be. 
</P>
<P>
Then the conversation took another turn, and the topic was former Indianapolis 
Colt quarterback Bert Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 39, has been out of the game for eight years but finished first among 
old-timers and fourth among all quarterbacks in a competition recently staged 
in Hawaii for TV. San Diego Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard has talked 
with Jones about playing this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bobby is looking for publicity," Young said. "Nothing a quarterback 
does counts unless it's against a pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert Jones was a great talent but he started going downhill the day he got 
married," Young said. "After that, he flinched. The second coming of Bert Jones 
is John Elway. Elway has the same great arm, he can run, he's a leader. He even 
wears the same number." 
</P>
<P>
It was one of those sessions you hate to see end.

OFFICER SLAYING UNDERLINES GROWING RISK IN DRUG WAR

Thursday's bloody ambush of a Fullerton undercover police officer underscores 
the increasing potential for violence facing drug investigators and the 
wide-ranging, sometimes nomadic nature of narcotics dealers who cross city 
borders to do business. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Tommy De La Rosa, 43, was fatally wounded by drug dealers at a modest 
stucco home where he went to deliver what he promised would be a 200-kilogram 
shipment of cocaine. Before he died, De La Rosa shot and killed one suspect, 
and police later arrested 13 others with suspected ties to the drug ring. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Friday that the gunmen apparently wanted to steal the 
cocaine and did not know that De La Rosa was participating in a reverse sting 
operation during which the suspects were ostensibly to buy $4 million worth of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say De La Rosa's death illustrates the danger of undercover 
narcotics agents who regularly confront heavily armed drug dealers who think 
nothing of preying upon each other to steal narcotics or money. 
</P>
<P>
"The level of violence is on an upward spiral," said Special Agent Ralph 
Lockridge, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Los 
Angeles. "It's hard to recall a case when we dealt with drug traffickers who 
weren't armed. It's just part of the game now." 
</P>
<P>
National statistics indicate that DEA agents are involved in two gun battles a 
week on average. Lockridge said assaults, stabbings and beatings of federal 
narcotics officers occur almost daily across the country. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the worst incidents, two DEA agents were killed and a third wounded 
in February, 1988, during an undercover operation in a posh Pasadena 
neighborhood. The prospective drug sellers opened fire on the officers as they 
negotiated a $90,000 heroin deal. Return fire killed two suspects and four 
others were arrested. Authorities said the slain agents, George M. Montoya, 34, 
and Paul Seema, 52, and the wounded officer, Jose Martinez, 25, were victims of 
"an obvious murder-theft" setup to steal money for the drug-buy. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 29 officers have died in the line of duty, but De La Rosa is 
the only one killed by gunfire during a drug operation, according to statistics 
compiled by the Sheriff's Department. Two other officers, Sheriff's Deputy Mark 
S. Tonkin, 31, and Anaheim Police Officer Gary A. Nelson, 35, were killed in 
helicopter accidents while participating in drug-related surveillances. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police say that they have been shot at during several narcotics 
investigations and that at least two Santa Ana drug agents have been wounded by 
gunfire in slightly more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics investigators for the Sheriff's Department estimate that about 80% of 
the narcotics dealers they investigate are armed with knives, pistols, 
shotguns, semiautomatic or automatic weapons. On a few occasions, they say, 
they have seen booby traps. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been something that has been gaining momentum for several years," Santa 
Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said. "People who would never have thought to arm 
themselves 15 years ago, such as marijuana dealers, are obtaining weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Although many drug dealers carry weapons, what has changed, authorities say, is 
their willingness to pull the trigger to protect their cash and drugs or to 
steal the same from other traffickers. Sometimes, drug agents like De La Rosa 
get caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. Vince Howard, head of the city's narcotics bureau, said that 
during his long tenure as a drug investigator he has heard about numerous 
narcotics rip-offs from traffickers who claim to have been victimized. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear about this regularly. They have been ripping each other off for 
years," Lockridge said. "That's what makes it such a dirty, dangerous game. No 
one trusts anyone. And that's what makes it such a high-risk occupation for 
undercover agents." 
</P>
<P>
Lockridge warned that violence in the drug trade could increase as supplies of 
cocaine and other narcotics are curtailed in the nation's war on drugs. He 
quoted national drug policy director William J. Bennett as saying "the dogs 
will be fighting over fewer bones." 
</P>
<P>
"The risks are always there," said Fullerton Police Chief Philip Goehring. "How 
much will a man kill a man over? Four million dollars or $4? I have seen a man 
killed over a burrito. . . . At a small moment in time, Officer De La Rosa was 
on his own, and it was at that very moment when this (his death) transpired." 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa, a father of four, was killed during a multiagency operation that 
had targeted an Orange County cocaine ring with activities extending into the 
Los Angeles area. Joining Fullerton police were Anaheim, Brea, Cypress, La 
Habra and Placentia officers. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is not unlike a growing number of cooperative arrangements set 
up by law enforcement agencies to combat increasingly sophisticated drug 
traffickers, whose operations transcend municipal, county and state boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, police departments have created more units with regional 
responsibilities. The squads have been encouraged by the changing nature of the 
drug trade and federal asset-seizure laws passed in 1984, which allow law 
enforcement agencies to seize drugs, money and property from suspected 
narcotics dealers without having to convict them of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, local, state and federal law enforcement agencies banded 
together in the mid-1980s to form the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program 
under the command of a Sheriff's Department captain. The pool of narcotics 
investigators from at least 18 departments handles major investigations and 
asset-seizure cases throughout Orange County and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during its first four years of operation, RNSP officers 
have seized at least 9,500 pounds of cocaine, 2,228 pounds of marijuana and $45 
million in assets from drug traffickers. The FBI has described the unit as one 
of the most effective of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you are a large enough department, you cannot always handle major cases 
on your own," said Helton of the Santa Ana police. "Here in Orange County, if 
you have a large narcotics deal, it would not be uncommon to solicit the aid of 
other cities." 
</P>
<P>
On a smaller scale, but with the same approach in mind, individual law 
enforcement agencies have been pursuing narcotics suspects beyond their city 
borders with increasing regularity. 
</P>
<P>
Brea police were among the first in Southern California to recognize the need 
for cooperation and the potential of federal asset-seizure laws that allow 
local police to claim as much as 90% of the cash and assets confiscated in 
criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Brea formed a special enforcement division, and one of the officers 
began using a seized red Corvette to help him infiltrate drug rings throughout 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brea is in Orange County, the unit often worked with a Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department drug squad based in Whittier. Brea officers helped 
on tedious stakeouts and followed suspects, whether they headed for the San 
Fernando Valley or Las Vegas. It has paid off. The department has received its 
share of more than $4 million from seized cash and assets. 
</P>
<P>
In still another example of cooperation, four small police departments in 
Maywood, Bell-Cudahy, South Gate and Huntington Park formed the Southeast Area 
Narcotics Enforcement Team two years ago. The cities had so few resources -- 
Maywood had only 25 sworn officers at the time -- that they could hardly make a 
dent in the local narcotics problem on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 10 SEANET officers still arrest pushers at local parks and raid 
rock houses, they periodically have helped DEA agents investigate truckers 
suspected of transporting narcotics.

ISRAELI OFFICER SAYS HIGHER-UPS ORDERED BEATINGS

A tearful Israeli colonel broke down during his court-martial Friday, saying 
his commanders abandoned him to face charges that he ordered his soldiers to 
beat and break the limbs of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. I said beat them on the limbs and then release them," Israel Radio quoted 
Col. Yehuda Meir, 38, as telling three military judges when asked if he had 
given orders to break Arabs' bones during the uprising in Israeli-occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he was carrying out orders that then-Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
issued in January, 1988. Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, former army chief in the West 
Bank and Meir's commanding officer, has testified that he did not recall such 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said when asked by his lawyer how he felt about his commander's 
testimony, Meir broke down crying and said: "They've abandoned me. They've 
thrown me to the dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Rabin defended his policy in a radio interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I ordered the army at that stage, after a time of heavy use of firearms which 
did not bring results, that units fighting violent riots . . . should go in and 
beat the demonstrators to control them as long as the riots continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't use the phrase 'break bones,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The radio also quoted Meir as comparing Israeli soldiers fighting the uprising 
to Lebanese Christian militiamen who massacred Palestinian refugees at the 
Sabra and Chatilla camps in 1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"The army began to act like hooligans. The distance between this and what the 
Falangists (militiamen) did was small," the radio quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Meir is the highest-ranking officer to be tried for offenses against Arabs 
during the 30-month-old uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
In seven felony counts, he is accused of ordering soldiers to smash the arms 
and legs of Palestinians in the West Bank villages of Beita and Hawwara in 
January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Meir's men are alleged to have rounded up about 21 Palestinians named as 
agitators by the Shin Bet secret police, taken them into nearby fields and then 
beaten them with rifles and clubs. At least 12 reportedly suffered broken 
limbs. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Meir had testified that Rabin instructed senior officers: "You do 
the work, I'll deal with the press and the law."

AGENTS FIND FRAUD RING AT CREDIT BUREAU; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SOURCES SAY AN EMPLOYEE AT THE TRW CREDIT DATA DIVISION GAVE SENSITIVE 
INFORMATION TO OUTSIDERS, WHO USED IT TO OBTAIN MERCHANDISE.

<P>
U.S. Secret Service agents have uncovered a fraud ring that was funneling 
sensitive credit information out of the TRW Credit Data Division, one of the 
nation's largest credit bureaus, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, conducted with the aid of TRW security personnel, is nearly 
complete, The Times has learned. Several sealed indictments have been obtained, 
according to the Secret Service, which investigates credit card fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The ring reportedly involved a TRW employee who leaked information to a group 
of outsiders. They, in turn, used the information to fraudulently obtain 
merchandise and for other illegal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The misuse of credit card numbers and other sensitive personal data stored in 
TRW's massive credit record database is believed to have gone on for a year or 
more at credit division headquarters in the city of Orange, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Secret Service and TRW officials confirmed that an investigation is under way, 
but they said they could not give any details until the indictments are 
unsealed. They gave no indication of when the indictments will be made public, 
nor would they comment on the scope of the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"There are sealed indictments, but we can give no further comment," said Don 
Chacos, supervisor of the Secret Service fraud squad in Los Angeles. Chacos 
said the indictments are the result of a "long-term" investigation, but he 
would not be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
The TRW employee whose conduct was under investigation has been terminated, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was an employee at TRW but was terminated in May," TRW spokeswoman 
Jennifer Sanchez replied when asked about the worker in question. "We have been 
working with the Secret Service, but we can't comment on the case." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said the employee was hired at TRW in 1986 and worked in the consumer 
relations section, which handles consumer complaints and inquiries about credit 
records. Employees in that section handle such tasks as opening and sending 
mail, she said, and they have access to the millions of computerized financial 
records TRW keeps on individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Although TRW is best known for its satellites and high-technology products, its 
credit division is one of the largest in the nation. The files contain the 
important elements of the financial histories of millions of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers and merchants such as car dealers and furniture store sales 
representatives often purchase TRW data on prospective customers to see whether 
those people pay their bills and pay them on time. That information forms the 
basis for a decision whether to extend them more credit. The data includes 
outstanding mortgages and loans, bankruptcies, credit card numbers and 
individuals' addresses, birth dates and Social Security numbers, according to 
TRW. 
</P>
<P>
TRW and two other leading credit data banks have come under fire recently from 
consumer groups and Congress for lapses in securing their information from 
computer hackers, con artists and other prying outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
TRW and other credit bureaus say they have taken steps to secure their 
databases but admit that their systems are not foolproof. With that in mind, 
the firms are seeking more severe federal penalties for illegal entry into 
their databases. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said that TRW has a series of internal protections to prevent employees 
from being able to take advantage of their access to the database. The system 
can, for instance, discover whether employees are trying to alter their own 
records to remove negative information, she said.

An ex-bus driver charged with a fatal random shooting rampage died at the jail 
ward of San Mateo County General Hospital, apparently from his second suicide 
attempt, officials said. Paul Bellazain, 48, was found with one end of his 
bathrobe was tied around his neck and the other was connected to the motorized 
frame of his bed which he apparently activated to strangle himself, an official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellazain, who had been on disability leave from his job as a bus driver with 
the San Francisco Municipal Railway, was in custody for fatally wounding James 
Vazko, 43, a copy editor with the San Francisco Examiner, May 1 with a shotgun. 
He was also accused of wounding a motorist and wounding two Daly City police 
officers in a shoot-out.

COUNSELOR HELPS YOUTHS AVOID GANGS

<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Hernandez is a 24-year-old man with an old problem: battling the city's 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, Hernandez was hired as the city's first neighborhood 
coordinator, a new job aimed at steering youths away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids have so much potential," said Hernandez, a recent graduate of Cal State 
Fullerton. Learning how to guide that potential into positive behavior is his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in September, Hernandez plans to implement a "gang curriculum" in the 
city's fifth-grade classes. The program will attempt to build self-esteem and 
help children cope with problems. It also will attempt to include parents. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to equip parents to handle this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez also is designing "anti-gang behavior" posters and buttons. 
</P>
<P>
But one of his biggest problems, Hernandez said, is funding. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to work with the minimum, but I do the best with what I have." 
</P>
<P>
Last year the $50,000 needed to start the program was shared equally by the 
city and the four school districts that serve Buena Park. The agreement was 
only for one year and expires in November. So Hernandez spends much of his time 
looking for and applying for funding. Next month he will hear whether the 
$26,000 that the County Board of Supervisors approved for the program makes it 
over the final hurdle and into his budget. But even if that is approved he is 
still $18,000 short of his goal of $41,000 
</P>
<P>
Although Hernandez admits that his efforts are just "tapping the surface" of 
the gang problem, he says it is a move in the right direction. LYNDA NATALI

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week approved a 1990-91 budget of $80.5 million that 
projects a 16% growth in revenue over last year and includes a reserve of $10.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The city expects to add 58 new employees in the coming year, including eight 
police personnel and four positions in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nine firefighting jobs will be added in 1991-92 to staff a station scheduled to 
open in the northeast sector. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also includes $27 million for capital improvements, including $750,000 
for street maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Residents can expect small increases in certain licenses and other fees 
beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
A lost library card, once replaced at no charge, will cost up to $2. 
</P>
<P>
Videotape duplication offered through the library, which was also free, will 
now cost up to $20. 
</P>
<P>
Curbside trash pickup will cost at least 55 cents more each month to cover the 
cost of increased gate fees at county landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Builders of single-family homes will pay a 10% hike in developer and park 
acquisition fees, which will be raised from $1,500 to $1,650. MARY HELEN BERG

<P>
A budget package of more than $85 million was approved by the City Council this 
week, including an increase in the fee for parking tickets on street-sweeping 
days. 
</P>
<P>
On a 3-2 vote, the council increased the penalty from $19 to $21 for a 
violation of the city ordinance banning automobiles on the streets during 
street-sweeping times. 
</P>
<P>
The fee increase takes effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
According to city staff, the increase was necessary to offset costs associated 
with the city administering the collection process instead of the municipal 
court system, higher charges from the firm that handles the street sweeping, 
and increased landfill fees at county dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert F. Dinsen complained that he could "see no connection between 
what the county charges for dumping and raising" the parking ticket fee, noting 
that Anaheim charges $16 for a similar violation. Santa Ana charges $27 and 
Orange charges $20. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove's budget for 1990-91 also includes $15.5 million for the 
Redevelopment Agency and $10.6 million for the city Housing Authority. JIM

SCHOOL OFFICIAL QUITS, CRITICIZES POLICIES

<P>
John Perry, assistant superintendent for support services for the Orange 
Unified School District, resigned Thursday, but not before criticizing school 
board policies and urging the district to aspire "to the greatness it once 
enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
Before Perry made his brief statement before the board, board President Jeff 
Holstien thanked him for his two years of service to the district. 
</P>
<P>
"You may want to rescind that commendation," Perry said. "I have a few things 
to say." 
</P>
<P>
Perry criticized the district for allowing "union demands" to take priority 
over student programs and warned board members that "immediate steps" should be 
taken on a retirement benefits plan that threatens to bankrupt the district. 
</P>
<P>
Recent independent studies on district finances showed that a retirement 
package guaranteeing lifetime medical coverage could bankrupt the district 
within five years. The study showed the board had increased class size to fund 
the high cost of health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop the political deal-making," said Perry in a final recommendation, "and 
operate the Orange Unified School District like the $100-million business it is 
-- the business of educating the future citizens of this community." 
</P>
<P>
Board members avoided looking at Perry during the presentation. Holstien said 
later the criticism had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
Perry's resignation becomes effective July 1, ending a 20-year career as an 
Orange County school administrator. No replacement has been named. Perry said 
he was leaving the district to take a job in the private sector. MARY HELEN

CITY STAFF LAUDED AS COUNCIL OKS BUDGET

<P>
After applauding the city's financial well-being, the City Council passed a 
$22.5-million operational budget and a $24.5-million capital improvements 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for 1990-91 will fund such projects as a $5-million community center 
and the widening of Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
It represents an increase of 10.4% in operational expenditures, while revenues 
are projected to increase 11.6%. More than half of the operating costs are for 
fire and police services. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Frank Benest told council members that much of the increase in the 
budget can be attributed to state and federal mandates. 
</P>
<P>
The spending plan includes $400,000 in new expenditures for city services, with 
about $215,000 for new equipment and building improvements, and the remainder 
is for new staffing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the council established budget guidelines that limited new 
operational spending to $500,000, required expenditures to equal revenue and 
required a minimum reserve equal to 13% of expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Council members took turns congratulating the city staff on meeting or 
exceeding all three of the goals. According to city projections, income will 
exceed expenses in the next five years and reserves will range from 31% to 37% 
of expenditures. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

Henry T. Segerstrom, who is stepping down as chairman of the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center board of directors, was honored Friday night at a 
black-tie dinner held on the stage in the center's 3,000-seat theater in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom, 67, a managing partner of the Costa Mesa-based development firm 
C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons Inc., announced plans to retire from the 52-member 
board in April. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing him as president is William Lyon, head of the William Lyon Co., a 
Newport Beach-based development firm that is Southern California's largest home 
builder. 
</P>
<P>
"After having been president since the inception of the Performing Arts Center, 
he wanted to step down and give someone else a chance," said Hal Segerstrom, 
Henry Segerstrom's cousin and another managing partner in the family-owned 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Bylaws of the Performing Arts Center board prevented Segerstrom from serving 
more than three consecutive one-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
The gala was attended by prominent supporters of the Performing Arts Center, 
which opened in September, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"This is for all the people wanting to thank Henry for the leadership he's 
given over the years," said Thomas H. Nielsen, vice chairman of the Irvine Co. 
and a member of the gala organizing committee. "Since the land-use was approved 
for the Performing Arts Center, he has been the leader of all the efforts to 
design and build it." 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom headed fund-raising efforts in the mid-1980s that garnered $73.3 
million to build the Center's Segerstrom Hall theater complex. 
</P>
<P>
The Segerstrom family donated the land and pledged $6 million toward the 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way to expand the Center with a symphony concert hall and a 
small, multipurpose theater. WENDY PAULSON

TRASH-RATE INCREASE TO PAY FOR RECYCLING

<P>
Trash rates will be going up almost $2 a month starting July 1 to pay for a new 
recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly trash rates will increase from $7.23 to $9.18 one month before the 
recycling program starts Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The program will initially require residents to separate garbage into 
containers provided by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Orange-colored bins will be used for glass and plastic containers, and 
newspapers are to be placed on top of these bins, said City Manager Lee Risner. 
Non-recyclables will be placed in another container. 
</P>
<P>
Trash collection is handled by Western Waste Industries, which will sell the 
recyclable materials and give the proceeds to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city will soon begin separating its clippings of greenery and grass from 
regular trash. The materials will be compacted, but composting may be attempted 
in the future, Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is required by state law to complete a study of local waste by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Risner expects revenues from the sale of recycled materials to cover the cost 
of the required study. DAVID F. BURKE

HOME COURT IS WHERE TRAKH'S HEART IS; 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' BASKETBALL: BREA-OLINDA COACH HAS HAD OFFERS TO WORK ON THE COLLEGE 
LEVEL BUT NONE HAS BEEN JUST RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past 10 years, Mark Trakh has overseen the formation of a girls' 
basketball dynasty at Brea-Olinda High School. With each Orange League 
championship -- eight in all -- and Southern Section championship -- three -- 
Trakh and his Lady Cats have climbed higher and higher. 
</P>
<P>
They won the county's first girls' basketball state championship two seasons 
ago. Last season, Brea-Olinda attained its highest national ranking, fourth, 
and returned to the state final with a county-record 55-game winning streak 
before losing the title game to Auburn Placer. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this success, it has been hard for Trakh to leave the high school 
ranks and move on to college coaching. 
</P>
<P>
In April 1989, he turned down an offer to coach the girls' team at Chapman 
College. San Diego State asked Trakh to apply for an assistant's job this 
spring, but he never pursued it. "I'd like to move on, but the situation has to 
be a good one," said Trakh, 35. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a coward," he said. "I take risks, but I take well-thought-out, 
calculated risks. We're going to win here for the next seven years. I can't 
give that up that easily. I have a lot of kids who have made a commitment here. 
I'm in no rush, just because it's a college position, to give this up to go to 
the wrong position." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Trakh has it better than many college coaches. While many high school 
coaches share a desk with three or more other coaches in a caged-in area off 
the locker room, Trakh has his own spacious office -- complete with a VCR, 
television and other audio-visual equipment. His door opens into the high 
school's new 2,000-seat gymnasium where the Lady Cats draw an average of 900 
spectators, more than many local Division I and II women's programs draw. 
</P>
<P>
In Brea, the high school is the only show in town. Trakh has a 256-32 record 
and has received declarations of commendation from the county, the state 
legislature, the city, the board of education and Nancy Reagan. He is respected 
by the community and among his peers. It's a role he's very comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't take the Chapman job because I couldn't cut the ties," said Trakh, 
whose license plates read BREA BB. "I knew I had a really good team coming 
back, and I went with my heart, not with my head. I really felt that I wanted 
to coach Aimee (McDaniel) and Tammy (Blackburn) during their senior year in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, it was the move for me to take the Chapman position, but I 
didn't have retrospect at that time, I didn't have hindsight." 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County high school coaches have made the transition to college. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey McAulay, 30, was the last county coach to beat Trakh, in February, 1987. 
McAulay, who helped build a successful girls' basketball program at Katella, 
recently completed her first season at the University of Redlands, a Division 
III school. Previously, she spent two seasons as an assistant at Cal Poly 
Pomona after four years at Katella. She was 60-33 at Katella and led the 
Knights to the Southern Section 3-A final in 1987, her last season. 
</P>
<P>
McAulay agonized about leaving Katella. But then, she had a talk with Fullerton 
College Coach Colleen Riley, whom McAulay had assisted for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I was struggling with the decision," McAulay said. "I didn't want to leave the 
kids coming up and she said, 'You know what Mickey, every year there are going 
to be more kids, and in four years they're going to be gone. Are they worried 
about leaving you in four years?' The point being, you have to look to your own 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can look in the mirror and say I want a bigger challenge, put all the 
rest behind you and go for it. If it is meant to be, it will happen. I would 
tell Mark (that) you can't look back. You have to go full steam ahead and make 
the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
Trakh seems to have trouble getting up a head of steam about leaving 
Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
He has applied for coaching positions at the University of Hawaii more than 
once, and applied at UC Santa Barbara in 1986. Hawaii told him he didn't have 
enough experience. The school was looking for a former college assistant rather 
than a high school head coach. UC Santa Barbara sent him a form letter of 
rejection and didn't interview him. 
</P>
<P>
There is a trend among college athletic directors looking for head coaches to 
hire women who have been assistants at the college level, which could make it 
more difficult for Trakh. This trend is recognized by Mike Thornton and 
Anastacio (Nash) Rivera, former high school girls' basketball coaches in the 
county who have moved up to the collegiate ranks. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years and a 152-92 record with the Marina girls, Thornton, 42, 
moved to Orange Coast College. Last season, his first OCC team was 26-6 and 
finished second in the Orange Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton realizes, however, that moving to a four-year school would be a lot 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's really difficult for a man to get a head coaching job at the 
four-year level," Thornton said. "Ten to 15 years ago, it was an advantage 
being male. But now you have many, many more qualified women coming out of 
college who have been involved in athletic systems for a long time and there is 
a lot of opportunity for them right now. I think all things being equal, a 
woman is going to get the job and rightfully so because it has been the other 
way around for so long." 
</P>
<P>
After 21 years of coaching high school basketball, Nash Rivera became an 
assistant at a four-year college five years ago at the age of 50. But he never 
went job-hunting. UCLA women's coach Billie Moore, at whose camps he had worked 
for years, recruited him. 
</P>
<P>
Nash was one of Orange County's most respected coaches after guiding El 
Dorado's boys to Southern Section 2-A titles in 1974 and '75. He coached girls 
for the next three seasons, winning the league championship once and qualifying 
for playoffs all three years. Then he moved to Chaffey Community College as an 
assistant men's coach for one year and finally to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
His history with Moore helped negate his age and his gender as factors in 
getting the job, two things Trakh may have to contend with, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good female assistants out there," Rivera said. "Division I 
(athletic directors) are taking either former head or assistant coaches from 
good collegiate programs. The female head coaches are developing assistants. 
They are doing what Bobby Knight and Dean Smith have done. They are developing 
good assistants and looking out for them trying to get them jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark has a lot of time, but I think he is going to be competing with a lot of 
young coaches for these positions and the people who hire and fire are going to 
think about that. They are going to ask, 'How long is it going to take him to 
establish a program like he has at Brea?' " 
</P>
<P>
McAulay said there are more men than women coaching women at the collegiate 
level. She said the number of women applying for positions is decreasing. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino threw another twist into the coaching 
shuffle. He hired Bernadette Locke as a men's assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have a better chance if you're a qualified woman," Trakh said. 
"I'm not so sure that isn't proper. But now you have Pitino hiring a woman. So 
I guess we're going in the direction where the most qualified person should 
coach the team. I think it should be the most qualified person for that 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Trakh has more credentials, in terms of his records, than Thornton, McAulay, 
Rivera or Deborah Woelke, who was successful as Trakh's Orange League rival at 
Valencia before becoming an assistant at UC Riverside this season. 
</P>
<P>
Trakh is halfway through completing a master's program in physical education at 
an Azusa Pacific satellite campus. 
</P>
<P>
But does he want to move on? 
</P>
<P>
He says he does, even though he's rooted firmly in Brea's soil. 
</P>
<P>
'See, next year is a challenge," he said. "Everyone is saying (all-state 
guards) McDaniel and Blackburn have graduated. (The program is) dead in the 
water. If I left after this year people would say, 'Hey, he jumped ship.' But 
if I stay, and try to build another winner . . . There has to be a certain 
degree of loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently 10 years is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've proven that I can coach on the high school level," Trakh said. 
"Someday I'm going to see, just for my own curiosity, if I can coach on the 
next level, see if I can recruit. See if I can 'X and O' with those people. I 
think I can. It's just a question of getting hired and hired in the right 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Chapman, I would have taken it in retrospect. It's still not the right 
situation. They didn't have enough scholarships to offer and there's no way you 
can compete with Pomona. I'm not going to take a position where it's not 
possible to win big. I can't go where the best I can do is second place. I have 
to be in a situation where I can be competitive with the top people in that 
conference or whatever. In other words, if a school can only offer five 
scholarships, it is going to be very hard for me to be competitive against 
schools that are offering eight scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
So Trakh grapples with the decision, the same one that faced Pat Riley, John 
Thompson at Georgetown and McAulay when she was at Katella. When is it time to 
move on? 
</P>
<P>
Said McAulay, "It was a really tough decision for me leaving Katella. I had to 
go with my head over my heart. A move like that, you have to take a chance . . 
. When I took the job at Katella, I took it on intuition. I knew it would be 
the right job. When I interviewed at Redlands, I had that same gut feeling." 
</P>
<P>
It's the same feeling Trakh will have. At least for one more season.

FAILED HUNTINGTON FEDERAL S&amp;L PURCHASED BY AMERICAN SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
American Savings Bank, created 18 months ago out of the ashes of the collapsing 
Financial Corp. of America in Irvine, purchased the failed Huntington Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan on Friday for $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Savings' two branches, with $114.2 million in deposits, will reopen 
Monday as American branches, Dianne Nelson, an American spokeswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
"This acquisition is consistent with our retail banking strategy to fortify our 
statewide branch network in our key market areas, such as Orange County," said 
W. Brent Robinson, executive vice president and director of American's retail 
banking. "We expect this to be a very smooth transition for these customers." 
</P>
<P>
American has two branches in Huntington Beach among its 178 branches statewide. 
Nelson said there are no plans to merge Huntington Savings' two branches into 
the existing branches. Huntington's 27 employees will be retained, she said. 
</P>
<P>
American also is picking up $6.4 million of the institution's assets, primarily 
cash and consumer loans, and will have the right over the next 60 days to buy 
$104.1 million in remaining assets, mainly home loans, from the Resolution 
Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC is the government agency that has been operating Huntington Savings 
since regulators declared the thrift insolvent and seized it on Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The agency predicts that Huntington's collapse will cost the RTC about $4.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Huntington's remaining assets are good-quality home loans, said Patrick 
Pittman, the RTC's supervisor for the closing. American, one of five bidders 
for Huntington, has the right to "cherry-pick" the remaining assets over the 
next 60 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owen Blicksilver, an American Savings spokesman, said the giant thrift, with 
$16 billion in assets, picked up the tiny S&amp;L because it had "significant 
franchise value . . . and consumer loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
Of the deposits American bought, about $76.2 million are considered core 
deposits, which are smaller accounts from local residents who are less likely 
than big account holders to move their deposits to other thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
American's $1.5-million payment is essentially 2% of core deposits. To gather 
that much in core deposits through advertising would take a long time and cost 
8% to 9% of the deposits garnered, Pittman said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"They got a good price." 
</P>
<P>
American Savings was itself created from the remains of the bankrupt FCA and 
its American Savings &amp; Loan unit, once the nation's largest thrift with 
more than $32 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators provided $1.7 billion in federal assistance when it sold half the 
institution to the Robert M. Bass Group in Ft. Worth, Tex. Bass put $350 
million into the deal. A second institution, New West Savings, was created to 
hold all the bad assets of the old American Savings and is a self-liquidating 
thrift managed by Bass personnel. 
</P>
<P>
American posted $214.2 million in net income in 1989.

ENCOUNTERS IN A STRANGE LAND; 
</P>
<P>
LATINOS: SENIOR CITIZENS GATHER ONCE A WEEK TO TALK IN SPANISH ABOUT THE PAST 
AND HELP EACH OTHER GET USED TO THE AMERICAN CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They came from countries far away, some fled for their lives. Now, they meet 
because they feel lost in a strange land -- the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 Spanish-speaking senior citizens meet every Friday morning at the East 
Valley Multipurpose Center in North Hollywood to talk about their lives -- good 
and bad, past and present. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, we talk of the past, we love the past," said Daisy Lugo, who 
left Costa Rica in 1946 to study English and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
One woman worries how her grandchildren talk back to her without respect. A man 
laments again about how he left everything behind when he escaped from his 
war-torn homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"We come here to share our happy and unhappy moments," said club president Raul 
Alacon through an interpreter. He has lived in the Valley for the 18 years 
since he fled Chile. He had an accident falling off his horse, lost the 
equestrian school he owned and suffered two crippling strokes, but he keeps his 
spirits up with friends at Encuentro Latino (which translates as "Latin 
Encounter"). 
</P>
<P>
The meetings are dressy. Men wear suits and ties. Women are treated with the 
respect typical of the Latino tradition in their generation. An impeccably 
dressed husband-and-wife team of physicians who fled Cuba 28 years ago comes to 
the meetings to advise friends about medical care and to reminisce. 
</P>
<P>
"Fidel Castro must go out," said Dr. Miguel Fuentes-Aguilera, sitting erect in 
his chair and looking at his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Then maybe, we go back," Dr. Margot Fuentes-Aguilera said while she sadly 
showed friends the gold $5 Cuban coin she made into a necklace. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group range from illegal alien farmers to former government 
officials who have left Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, Peru and the Philippines. 
About half of them have become American citizens. Many of them would someday 
like to go home again, or at least feel at home here. 
</P>
<P>
"I left my Colombia, my family and I cry so much, so much depression," said 
Georgina Martinez, 78, who moved here 15 years ago. "It was so beautiful, but 
now everyone takes care because somebody will kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez now worries about relatives in Colombia. She also worries that her 
grandsons may run into trouble with gangs in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The group tries to avoid politics, but inevitably their cultures clash and 
national pride causes lively debates. 
</P>
<P>
"The president from Chile picks on my small country," said Bilar Young, 62, a 
Cuban refugee whose son fought in the Bay of Pigs invasion. "Sometimes we have 
little wars here, but there are more Cubans in this group than anyone. Anyway, 
we are Americans first now." Emilia Casanovas chokes up when she remembers the 
rich, lush mountains of Bolivia, saying, "I would like to go back to see my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Learning English is the biggest problem for the group, but a language class 
formed by Encuentro Latino members eventually petered out for lack of interest. 
Most, like Filomena Medina, 73, taught themselves English. 
</P>
<P>
"I write down every word I don't know and learn it," said Medina, who came from 
Puerto Rico decades ago when her daughter was only 6. Now, she won't go to the 
meetings unless her daughter, Miriam Stern, comes with her. 
</P>
<P>
"The elderly take time to make acquaintances, but this is good because they go 
on field trips together and talk about their different cultures," said Stern, 
who helps out at the meetings. "The group is very traditional, very formal. 
That is how most of them have been brought up." 
</P>
<P>
Encuentro Latino was started 10 years ago by Theresa Chavez, a social worker 
with Jewish Family Services, who saw a need for Spanish-speaking people to help 
each other acclimate to American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"They are intimidated by the strong and assertive ways of Americans, and they 
are angry when they are lumped together and all called Mexicans," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fourth of July is our biggest celebration because this is the ground we 
are now on," said club secretary Elvira Rosas, an Argentine native who moved 
here 22 years ago. "For me, it is like therapy to come here." 
</P>
<P>
Members exchange information about government programs, nutrition and the 
latest news of their country. They trade shopping coupons, buy Lotto tickets 
together and share financial, medical and educational advice. Often, they are 
nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting, they played the Mexican national anthem to commemorate a 
holiday and a few natives held their clenched fists across their chests. Tears 
streamed down the face of Elena Velasquez, who left Mexico 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss my country," she said.

CAPTURING A GARDEN'S BLOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe your flower garden doesn't rival the ones adorning the covers of Better 
Homes and Gardens magazine. That's no excuse not to capture your own home-grown 
color on film. 
</P>
<P>
After spending so much time digging, planting and pulling weeds, photographing 
the brilliant results of your labor can be a rewarding experience. 
</P>
<P>
And who knows? Maybe the same flair you've exhibited in growing beautiful 
blossoms will show itself in your photographs. Your garden variety snapshots 
could be upgraded to works of art, suitable for framing or sale. 
</P>
<P>
All you need is someone to show you the way. 
</P>
<P>
A walk through a garden with photographer Carol Leigh may be the answer. The 
Santa Ana-based photographer organizes workshops to help people improve their 
garden photography. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important factors in garden snapshots is the light source. 
Leigh recommends shooting on cloudy or overcast days, when the light is even, 
which eliminates harsh shadows. 
</P>
<P>
Early morning is the best time to shoot flowers because they look fresh. 
Flowers look tired after a long day in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh also suggests that you move in tight. If you're taking pictures of a 
rose, don't show the chain-link fence in the background. For close-up shots, 
she prefers using a 90 or 100-mm macro lens because it allows her to work 
farther away than a 50- or 55-mm macro. If there is a butterfly on a pedal, a 
longer focal length keeps her from hovering too close and scaring it off. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what's wrong with most pictures is that people are concentrating on 
the emotion of the moment and (their) camera is not capturing that same 
emotion, it's capturing everything (in view)," says Leigh, 41. "As you progress 
as a photographer, you need to learn how to be disciplined and tighten up your 
pictures to eliminate the extraneous." 
</P>
<P>
A tripod is also helpful in photographing flowers. You need the camera to be 
stable to get the greatest amount of sharpness and depth-of-field at a slow 
shutter speed. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh uses either Fujichrome 50 or 100 slide film. "The colors are terrific," 
she said. "I always prefer slides, what you see is what you get. With print 
film, depending on the lab, your color could be off." 
</P>
<P>
If your photography starts to impress other people, consider entering the 
professional market. Leigh sells her photographs to greeting card makers, 
calendar companies and magazines. The "Photographer's Market," published by 
Writer's Digest, lists thousands of buyers and offers advice on how to pedal 
your photographs. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you a real good clue as to who's buying pictures, what format they 
are looking for and how much they are willing to pay," Leigh said. "You also 
have to take the initiative and search out your own publications." 
</P>
<P>
Photographers looking to improve their flowery images can join Leigh as she 
leads a photo walk at Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar on July 28. The flower 
photography workshop costs $15. 
</P>
<P>
Other classes offered by Leigh include one at Mission Interiors in San Juan 
Capistrano on July 14 for $25 and a Back Bay Bird Walk in Newport Beach on Dec. 
15 for $15. For more information, call (714) 744-6566.

The state presidency in Croatia, where Communists were defeated last month in 
the first free elections since World War II, has approved draft amendments to 
drop "socialist" from the republic's name and to remove the Communist red star

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 
</P>
<P>
CITY, BUILDER STRIKE TENTATIVE ARENA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM and LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Anaheim would be liable for up to $2.5 million a year if its 
proposed 20,000-seat indoor arena operates at a loss, according to a proposed 
agreement with the facility's developer and operator. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden Corp. of New York also would be granted the concession contract at 
neighboring Anaheim Stadium beginning next year under the agreement scheduled 
to be considered by the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's done, I think," Neil Papiano, the Los Angeles attorney representing the 
developer, said Friday of the oft-delayed negotiations between Ogden and the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope construction will begin at the end of October (or) the first of 
November," Papiano said. "It's just a function now of drawing the architectural 
plans, getting an agreement with the (building) contractor and start building." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Daly said he was "very confident" that the arena would succeed, 
and that the potential financial liability to the city was "limited." 
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with the proposed package. I am ready to support it," Daly 
said. "I have no doubt that this arena will be a huge success, and I'm 
absolutely confident that in a few short years, the Anaheim Arena will be one 
of the busiest and most profitable arenas in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Other City Council members, most of whom were at a mountain retreat with City 
Manager James Ruth, could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a nearly identical arena proposed in Santa Ana has been stalled by a 
lawsuit challenging the Santa Ana City Council's approval of it. Most observers 
believe the Orange County market can support only one arena. 
</P>
<P>
The completion date of the Anaheim Arena is now projected to be October, 1992, 
in time for the beginning of the National Basketball Assn. and National Hockey 
League seasons, Papiano said. He said negotiations to attract professional 
sports franchises to play in the arena are continuing, but he declined to 
identify which teams may be involved. 
</P>
<P>
Among the agreements recommended for Anaheim City Council action on Tuesday are 
the final approval of a complex series of land purchases and relocation 
agreements to provide property for the arena on Douglass Road, north of Katella 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Ogden and the city began in September, 1988, and 
appeared to be on shaky ground several times. The greatest risks to the project 
were an unexpected increase in construction costs from $85 million to about 
$100 million, and the delay of several months because of lawsuits challenging 
the project on environmental grounds. 
</P>
<P>
But the lawsuits, filed by the Los Angeles Rams, Anaheim Stadium Associates and 
the owner of a neighboring mobile home park, were settled out of court in May. 
And city officials are now apparently agreeable to footing more of the bill 
should the arena operate at a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's risk has gone up substantially," Papiano said. The increased risk 
stems from higher construction costs and early estimates that "were a little 
optimistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Arena would be owned by the city, but operated by Ogden Corp. and 
the Nederlander Group, which will book entertainment acts to appear there. The 
agreement would provide the city with as much as 30% of the net arena profits 
after 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the arena agreements, Ruth, the primary negotiator for Anaheim, is 
recommending that Ogden take over the concession agreement for Anaheim Stadium, 
which is now operated by ARA Leisure Services of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for ARA Leisure Services could not be reached for comment Friday. But 
ARA officials have said they hoped their contract, which they described as one 
of the most lucrative in the nation, would be renewed when it expires at the 
end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for Ogden to pay the city a "grant" of $5 million and 
extend a loan of $2 million to be used for improvements to concession stands 
and other areas of the stadium. MARK LANDSBAUM and LISA MASCARO

CAINE REMAINS POSITIVE ABOUT FUTURE OF COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS; 
</P>
<P>
UC IRVINE: FORMER ANTEATER ATHLETIC DIRECTOR RETIRING AFTER 30 YEARS AS COACH 
AND ADMINISTRATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 30 years in college athletics, UC Irvine's John Caine remains, 
rather remarkably, an optimist. He believes the NCAA basically does a good job, 
that college athletes should play for love of the game and not for pay, and 
that one day a football team will wear UC Irvine jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
Caine stepped down as athletic director at Irvine last September, when an 
ongoing financial crisis prompted Chancellor Jack Peltason to restructure the 
department. Caine stayed on as a special assistant for athletic planning to 
Peltason during the past year. He is retiring from the university June 30, and 
this week looked back on his career. 
</P>
<P>
Caine, 65, began his career as a basketball coach and went on to become 
athletic director at four major colleges, including Cal State Fullerton and 
Irvine, Orange County's two NCAA Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
He oversaw the start of the Fullerton football program in 1970, hiring as its 
first coach Dick Coury, now a Ram assistant coach. In 1972, after four years at 
Fullerton, he became athletic director at San Jose State, where he hired 
football coach Darryl Rogers, who later became coach of the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Caine moved to the Pacific-10 Conference in 1976, becoming athletic director at 
Oregon. He resigned in 1981 after an academic scandal involving the football 
program, although an investigation showed he had no knowledge of the 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived at Irvine in 1983, with "recharged batteries," as he described it 
then. During his six years, he was involved in the building of the 5,000-seat 
Bren Center, which replaced tiny, 1,496-seat Crawford Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Caine's thoughts on a range of topics follow. 
</P>
<P>
On the NCAA: "Without the NCAA, there would be absolute anarchy in college 
sports, and it wouldn't be any fun. We wouldn't have the championships, we 
wouldn't have the concern for the students. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying at various times I don't disagree with what the NCAA does. 
Despite all its faults and handicaps, it works. 
</P>
<P>
"If it didn't have power, then again there would be anarchy. We wouldn't have 
controls. Everybody thinks it's a mess. OK, it's a mess. What would you do to 
change it? When you get through thinking that out, you think maybe they're not 
doing such a bad job." 
</P>
<P>
On cheating: "I never liked cheaters when I was a coach. Incidentally, I did 
very little of it along the way. I did a little bit, everybody does. Most 
people I know in this business have been pretty clean. Most people run a pretty 
clean ship. 
</P>
<P>
"When people go out and design a way to cheat and break the rules, those are 
the people you like to see nailed. The small mistakes, taking an athlete to the 
airport, those rules I have trouble with. 
</P>
<P>
"There is degree involved. There is the very severe degree where the academic 
prestige of the university is involved, or where I buy you a car or I get your 
parents a home. There's that as opposed to more minimal offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I've turned people in, in a casual manner. Not flamboyantly or secretly. I 
have mentioned to authorities that I think this or that needs to be 
investigated. I've done that to the NCAA, to the conference, to the person 
themselves. I say, 'Knock it off. You can make it without doing that. You're a 
fool.' " 
</P>
<P>
On the Bren Center: "Our athletic program would have come to a grinding halt if 
we had not replaced Crawford Hall. One year UNLV was ranked second in the 
country and Fresno State was ranked eighth, and they played back-to-back games 
in Crawford Hall. We had to build the Bren Events center. The administration is 
not happy with the debt, but I don't think they blame me." 
</P>
<P>
On basketball coach Bill Mulligan: "There's nobody else close to the record 
Bill has against (UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian, whose teams Mulligan has beaten 
six times in the 1980s)." 
</P>
<P>
On last season's 5-23 record: "I have a lot of confidence in Bill. Look at his 
record (484-255 in 24 seasons, 10 at Irvine). That's how you judge a coach, 
over all those years. I've got confidence Bill will get it straightened out. He 
had some breakdowns in recruiting and the play of upperclassmen."

On Cal State Fullerton football: "Langsdorf (William B., then university 
president) came to me and said, 'Let's get football going.' How much money did 
we have? Seven-thousand dollars. I told that to Dick Coury, and he couldn't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened in the ensuing 20 years is they've struggled. They had two 
very fine years. They've grown competitively, and Gene Murphy has done an 
excellent job. I really admire him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very disappointed in the support Fullerton has gotten, 
football-wise. It deserves much more. Of course, it will always be difficult in 
the Southern California entertainment arena. There are wrestling matches going 
on all over the place. Body-slams everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
On UC Irvine's prospects for football: "I personally do not think we will ever 
be a completely mature athletic program until we get the sport of football. My 
recommendation is not to play Division I, but to put a program on the (Division 
III) level and then go to the (Division II) level with non-scholarship players, 
playing against schools like UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara. I prefer (Division 
II) without scholarships. Scholarships are very expensive, even at the state 
university level. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some real ifs. If the student body will agree to support football 
with an operational budget -- no scholarships -- and if the community will 
agree to build a special building. We have to have those variables where the 
conventional budget would not be impacted. I'd be the first to say, let's get 
it going as soon as we can." 
</P>
<P>
On Fullerton's football schedule: "Fullerton plays nationally (ranked teams). 
True, it gets skinned or skunked, but it plays nationally." 
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of Irvine playing major college football: "I don't think it's 
out of the question we'll be playing UCLA, Stanford, USC. I have this 
confidence that UC Irvine is going to grow into a mighty force one of these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"I have dreams of Florida 65, UC Irvine, 66." 
</P>
<P>
On small college football: "Can't we operate differently (than USC)? Can't we 
play football for love of the game? Is that not possible?" 
</P>
<P>
On alumni support: "A small number of people have just done a great job here. 
That was the key, I think, to the success of the Bren Events Center campaign. 
But the problem at UCI, Long Beach State and Fullerton is we just don't have 
enough people involved. That to me is a reflection more on the alumni than 
anybody else. I don't mean be critical; some do help but not enough do. There 
is a reason for that, partly because there are younger alumni." 
</P>
<P>
On the scandal at Oregon: "The Oregon thing was very hard, the last year of 
scandal. After it was over, I wanted to get out of there. Oregon took its 
licks, took its penalties. Before I got this job, you want to imagine how much 
UCI checked me out? I hadn't been aware of what was going on. That's a little 
hard for people to believe. Frankly, I understand. How can a guy be this close 
to the situation and not know? I think it's possible for an athletic director 
to not know. It happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
On the past year: "To go from hands-on to the hypothetical is an experience. If 
I would have had a clue that I would be asked to move into the chancellor's 
office, I probably would have retired. But I was asked to stay on, to do this 
planning, which I agreed to do." 
</P>
<P>
On his career: "The athletes over the years have been just great. In all my 
years, there haven't been more than three or four kids I didn't like. There've 
been three or four real pills. I've enjoyed almost all the others. I see what 
they've done with there lives. I'll throw a couple of names at you: Tod Murphy, 
a fine young fellow. Chris Duplanty, just a great kid. Buffy Rabbitt. Johnny 
Rogers. Scott Brooks. I don't want to leave people out, but I can't name them 
all."

</P>
<P>
ROCK: IN THE 1970S, TODD RUNDGREN SPUN OUT MUSIC IN HIGH-TECH SOLITUDE. NOW, 
AMID AN ERA OF SAMPLERS AND SYNTHESIZERS, HE'S FOCUSING ON LOW-TECH, NON-DUBBED 
RECORDING. HE PLAYS THE COACH HOUSE BEGINNING TONIGHT.

<P>
Back in the 1970s, Todd Rundgren didn't hesitate to weave an aura around the 
fact that he was one of rock's first do-it-yourselfers. 
</P>
<P>
He dubbed himself "Wizard" in one album title and "Hermit" in another. Fans 
could picture Rundgren as a skinny, long-faced studio gnome, an eccentrically 
humorous guru of recording technology, huddled alone in high-tech solitude as 
he spun out crafty pop unaided by other human hands. Rundgren created almost 
all of his landmark 1972 album, "Something/Anything," working by himself in a 
studio rigged up in his living room. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, though, Rundgren has taken off the mask of a technological Lone Ranger. 
Last year, the "Nearly Human" album consisted of live-in-the-studio 
performances by Rundgren and a large backing ensemble of singers and players. 
Now, the erstwhile hermit is about to step out of the studio entirely. Next 
month, Rundgren and his 11-member band are scheduled to record an album of new 
songs in a series of five theater shows in San Francisco. The idea is to get a 
strong performance of each song, without overdubbing. If there are any flubs, 
Rundgren will call another take and start over from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
The need to minimize flubs is what brings Rundgren and band to the Coach House 
for a series of shows beginning Saturday night. The aim is to perfect the new 
songs in time for those San Francisco recording dates. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking recently from his home in Marin County, where he was busy writing his 
new material on deadline, Rundgren said that his own contrarian impulses play a 
large part in his recent emphasis on real-time performances. Being a 
techno-wizard may have been a novelty in the early 1970s, but now digital 
technology has become the dominant force in pop record making. With so many 
sounds available from samplers and synthesizers, interaction between 
flesh-and-blood musicians is being supplanted more and more by 
computer-generated "performance." 
</P>
<P>
"Once everybody starts doing a certain thing, I feel inclined to do things the 
other way," Rundgren said. "I started to miss the performance element, the 
awareness that there were people playing to each other. I wanted to recapture 
it. My records are a forum for the things I want to hear, but don't hear 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the late 1960s, when he led the Nazz, a Philadelphia-based 
psychedelic rock band, Rundgren has shown a knack for the sort of catchy 
tunefulness that is the raw material of most pop hits. But Rundgren's music 
only occasionally has intersected with a mass audience. Over a 22-year career 
dating back to the Nazz, he has placed six singles and four albums (including 
recordings by his now-defunct rock band, Utopia), in the Billboard Top 40. 
</P>
<P>
Rundgren, who celebrated his 42nd birthday Friday, says he is content with his 
cult status. His creative juices aren't stimulated by the idea of concocting a 
new pop hit. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no juice, none of that juice, particularly considering the 
criteria for a hit single nowadays," Rundgren said, interrupting his urbane 
conversation with a chuckle. "I feel no loss at not being in the same 
(category) as Milli Vanilli. Pop music is at a creative nadir nowadays, and it 
doesn't concern me that I'm not successful. I don't want to devalue some 
legitimate artists who by some quirk have gotten a good piece of music up in 
the lofty reaches of the pop charts, but there's something devaluing about 
being up there with Paula Abdul and Madonna." 
</P>
<P>
Rundgren says the lofty reaches he wants to explore with his music don't 
involve anything as tangible as a high chart position. Instead, he probes for 
meaning in the mystical, searching current running through many of his recent 
songs. "Hawking," from the "Nearly Human" album, is a particularly inspired 
example. The song is a meditation on human frailty and aspiration, based on the 
example of Stephen Hawking, the best-selling British author and astrophysicist 
who reaches out to chart the universe with a mind trapped in a paralyzed body. 
</P>
<P>
"The inspiration (for "Hawking") was not anecdotal -- one person with a disease 
-- so much as the concept of what bravery is and what humanity is," Rundgren 
said. "So many people waste themselves. They just kind of fall into an average 
consumerist existence, and life is an endless round of the latest TV show and 
the latest movie. They forget the greater questions of what existence is about, 
why these things are here for our benefit." 
</P>
<P>
In searching through those big questions, Rundgren often resorts to soul-styled 
vocals. With his flexible but thin-bodied voice, Rundgren isn't the likeliest 
soul singer in the world, and his vocal reach sometimes exceeds his grasp as he 
tries to trace the soul tradition's demanding, gospel-derived swoops, stretches 
and spirals of voice. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a musical style appropriate to a lot of ideas I want to convey," 
Rundgren said of his decision to scale soul's peaks when he could comfortably 
master the easier grades of conventional rock singing. "It's designed to 
emotionally sensitize an audience. I'm not especially trying to be comfortable. 
Every so often you have to sing a comfortable song, so you can rest. For me, 
the value in the performance is to sort of empty yourself and to not feel that 
you've held back." 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite singer of all time is Marvin Gaye," Rundgren said, continuing his 
explanation of why he likes to overreach his technical limits. "Sometimes on 
record his voice cracks or he goes for notes he doesn't hit. If there's an 
element of what seems like physical strain in it, sometimes that's desirable to 
convey the urgency of what goes on. That's what makes him for me the best of 
the Motown singers. I always hated Diana Ross. To me, Diana Ross was the 
essence of lazy. I don't get off on the people who are comfortable and safe. I 
get off on the ones who are striving, and you can sense the urgency of what 
they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Rundgren says his own artistic striving is aimed these days at preserving the 
sort of nonconformist ethic of the 1960s that helped spur his own career. 
</P>
<P>
"When Reagan got elected, it really woke me up. I thought, 'God, the yahoos are 
out of the box now.' It's the responsibility of artists or people of any 
avocation to preserve that alternative society, where money is of secondary 
importance, and day-to-day appreciation of the gift of life is of prime 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
All this sounds like awfully lofty talk from a rocker who, in his younger days, 
seemed to delight in cracking smirking jokes in songs like the singles bar 
epic, "Slut," the scatological school-days reminiscence, "Piss Aaron," and the 
absurdist rocker, "Just Another Onionhead." 
</P>
<P>
Rundgren said his snide side may have been submerged lately, but it isn't 
missing. Last year he wrote some humorous songs for "Up Against It!" a musical 
adaptation of a film script that British playwright Joe Orton originally wrote 
for the Beatles in 1967. The production had an off-Broadway run in New York. 
That has led Rundgren to begin work on another musical -- the script as well as 
the songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that will be a bigger part of my musical life," said Rundgren, who 
joins the Kinks' Ray Davies in the ranks of rockers who have written a full 
production's worth of songs for the musical theater (Rundgren said he wasn't 
interested in seeing Davies' musical adaptation of Jules Verne's "Around the 
World in 80 Days," because he thinks the rock Hall of Famer has fallen into 
"lazy" songwriting habits). 
</P>
<P>
Rundgren said that he is thinking of working humor back into his rock songs as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"One concept in the back of my mind is to do an album that's meant to be funny. 
I will tend toward the ridiculous, probably. My sense of humor depends on a 
certain amount of things being bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Rundgren plays tonight at 9 p.m. and Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 8 
p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. 
Tonight's show is sold out. Tickets: $25. Information: (714) 496-8930.

CAN THIS GUY REALLY RUN A BIG BARGAIN BASEMENT?; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: PIC 'N' SAVE CHIEF LEWIS MERRIFIELD CERTAINLY THINKS SO. IF HE 
FAILS, IT WON'T BE FOR WANT OF TRYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
No one doubts Lew Merrifield's intelligence. When he isn't running the Pic 'N' 
Save retail chain, he says, he devours books -- as many as seven or eight a 
week -- and he finished No. 1 in the USC Law Center Class of 1966. 
</P>
<P>
No one questions Merrifield's intensity, either. A heavy-smoking, thickset 
powerhouse, he works seven days a week and, associates say, rarely talks about 
anything but business. 
</P>
<P>
But does Lewis B. Merrifield III have what it takes to get the job done at Pic 
'N' Save, the company he took charge of nearly four years ago? Has this 
one-time whiz in the button-down world of corporate securities law also 
mastered the art of operating bargain-basement stores? On that point, he has 
detractors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Merrifield's job is on the line. A takeover-minded investment group, 
Girard Partners, pressed him to put Pic 'N' Save up for sale, citing the 
company's 34% earnings decline last year and its sagging stock price. 
</P>
<P>
If Merrifield fails to snag a buyer by a July 15 deadline, Girard is expected 
to resume its campaign to win enough support from shareholders to seize control 
of the company. Girard has said it then would either buy Pic 'N' Save and oust 
Merrifield, or sell the company to a higher bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Merrifield gets credit for turning a seat-of-the-pants company into a 
professional organization that remains very profitable, but critics say he has 
overdone the overhaul in some respects. They maintain that Pic 'N' Save stores 
have become too neat and too much like conventional discount chains, deterring 
some bargain-hunters who enjoy sifting through messy piles of surplus or passe 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"The stores are too pretty," said Edward Randolph, a supplier to close-out 
stores and a former Pic 'N' Save shareholder. "People don't think they're 
getting bargains when items are lined up like soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, critics say, is that Merrifield seems to lack an 
instinctive feel for the boisterous close-out retail business. "There's an 
extra gene that merchants are born with, that you can't compensate for with a 
computer," said an industry observer who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also fault Merrifield for expanding too quickly and, in particular, for 
buying the struggling Job Lot Pushcart chain in the New York area. Pic 'N' Save 
now has 189 close-out stores, about double the total when Merrifield took 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Merrifield, 50, staunchly defends his performance, saying he inherited a 
business that had been milked by its prior bosses and was likely to be 
clobbered by emerging competitors. In fact, profit margins and sales gains were 
falling when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing as a perpetual motion machine, where you don't do 
anything and it still works," he said. "The signs of erosion were there." 
</P>
<P>
The only strategic mistake Merrifield confesses is failing to get the word out 
about the difficulty of the task he faced in turning Pic 'N' Save into an 
efficient, modern corporation. 
</P>
<P>
If investors expect a lot of Merrifield, it may be partly due to his pay. For 
serving as president and chief executive last year (he's now chairman, too), 
Merrifield got $975,000. 
</P>
<P>
Compensation consultants say that easily ranks in the top 10% for heads of 
companies the size of Pic 'N' Save, which had sales of $475 million last year. 
By comparison, John V. Roach, the head of Tandy Corp. -- a company nine times 
bigger and one that posted a higher after-tax return on sales in 1989 -- made 
$971,000. 
</P>
<P>
Board members say the pay was justified by the difficulties of the 
unpredictable close-out business, Merrifield's success in preparing the company 
for the future and his heavy workload. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's ever heard of a 40-hour week. I wouldn't be surprised if he 
put in twice that much time," said Stafford R. Grady, chairman of the 
compensation committee. 
</P>
<P>
Merrifield lives very well, but not lavishly by Southern California standards. 
Twice-divorced, he has custody of his 5-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter 
by his second marriage, and he shares a rented house with them in the flats of 
Beverly Hills. He motors down to Pic 'N' Save's headquarters in Dominguez in a 
navy blue Lincoln Continental. 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't working, he reads books on everything from organizational 
behavior to Taoism. Merrifield also meditates and occasionally practices 
martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
The son of an insurance executive, Merrifield grew up in Glendale and studied 
economics at UCLA before law school. He has long had a reputation as a quick 
study, said George Vandeman, a former USC classmate who is now the partner in 
charge of mergers and acquisitions for the law firm Latham &amp; Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to study 10 hours for a particular test to get the No. 2 grade," 
Vandeman said. "He'd have to study 20 or 30 minutes to get the No. 1 grade." 
</P>
<P>
Vandeman also is friendly with Merrifield's nemesis, David H. Batchelder, the 
head of Girard Partners and a former chief strategist for corporate raider T. 
Boone Pickens Jr. Vandeman describes Merrifield as the "much more serious 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
"David is a very smart guy, but he relies more on instincts developed by his 
experience," Vandeman said. "Lew will think things through at much greater 
length before coming to a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Merrifield clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, 
taught law at USC for two years before practicing with Gibson, Dunn &amp; 
Crutcher and, later, opened his own practice. 
</P>
<P>
Merrifield joined Pic 'N' Save's board in 1971 after doing the legal work to 
take the company public. Over the years he became increasingly interested in 
the business, and he emerged as the architect of the board's plan to put the 
company on a course of modernization and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1986, Merrifield became Pic 'N' Save's chief executive. As 
Merrifield and his senior executives tell it, Pic 'N' Save was in dire need of 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Bill-paying methods were so outdated, they say, that a senior executive had to 
sign every check, no matter how small. They say accounting was so crude that 
the company couldn't tell how any one store was doing. To shore up the company, 
computer systems and training programs were introduced. Stores were remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
But investors are unimpressed. Shares have fallen from around $21 when 
Merrifield took over to $12 or $13 recently. 
</P>
<P>
Gauging the company's performance under Merrifield is a matter of perspective. 
With earnings of $30.9 million last year, the company's after-tax return on 
sales was a strong 6.5%, versus an industry standard of roughly 4%. When 
Merrifield came in, the company's return was sliding, but was still an almost 
unheard-of 13.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials point to a first-quarter profit increase of 9.6% this year as 
a sign that the company is bouncing back. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Rothberg, an analyst with Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co., says Merrifield can be 
faulted for rapidly expanding Pic 'N' Save from its lucrative niche in Southern 
California into other parts of the West, as well as the South and the New York 
area. Expansion "has proven to be a very difficult task, and he has failed at 
it. Could anyone have done it? I don't know," Rothberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Rothberg added that if Merrifield gets a few more years for his long-term 
strategy, he might prove his critics wrong. But time may be running out. 
</P>
<P>
Girard Partners appeared to be gaining shareholder support for its effort 
before a temporary cease-fire was called to let Pic 'N' Save concentrate on 
looking for a buyer. Even if the company finds a buyer, the new owner might 
want new management. 
</P>
<P>
If Merrifield is forced out, it would be a tough blow for a man who says he has 
"loved the business a long time." Still, he claims he doesn't spend any time 
worrying about what might be. 
</P>
<P>
Said Merrifield, "You have to be very focused."
