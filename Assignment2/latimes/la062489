THE GENTLE CARDINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cardinal Timothy Manning guided the Archdiocese of Los Angeles during 15 of its 
most tumultuous years of growth. His style of leadership was as gentle as his 
manner, but on important matters he knew where his church should go and guided 
it with quiet precision. 
</P>
<P>
He made certain, for example, that the archdiocese made room for and made 
welcome hundreds of thousands of Latino immigrants, a pastoral obligation 
largely overlooked before he assumed leadership in 1970. He created a forum 
that gave the parishes of East Los Angeles their voice in affairs of the 
archdiocese and established a department in the Catholic Welfare Bureau to help 
eligible immigrants gain citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Manning was not a dynamic leader, but he was a superb listener and his calm 
approach was essential to seeing his diocese through years of expansion that 
six year ago led it past Chicago in Catholic population. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his quiet demeanor, Manning's description of the nuclear arms race 
in the early 1980s as a "dance of death" surprised many Southern Californians. 
It need not have. It was quite consistent with the gentle nature of Manning, 
who died of cancer Friday at age 79.

Four Congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating 
theft, mismanagement, favoritism and influence-peddling at the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity for boodle has rarely been so readily acknowledged. "I don't 
make any bones about it," said a former Reagan housing official as he explained 
how the hiring of prominent Republicans as lobbyists and consultants greased 
the skids for the delivery of public money into private hands. 
</P>
<P>
HUD's own auditors detected sloppy accounting and missing funds two years ago. 
The inspector general warned that millions of dollars could not be accounted 
for. The audit should have prompted closer scrutiny, greater accountability and 
new procedures, but on the whole did not. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Harrell, a private escrow agent in the Washington office, has admitted 
stealing $5.5 million from the sale of foreclosed property. There has been 
additional evidence of criminal activity. And new charges may result from 
investigations ordered by U.S. Attorney Dick Thornburgh. He has directed all 94 
U.S. attorneys to investigate local HUD offices. 
</P>
<P>
Former Reagan Administration officials have made lots of money in consulting 
fees in exchange for steering lucrative federal rehabilitation funds and rent 
subsidies to developers. Former Interior Secretary James G. Watt has testified 
before Congress that he made more than $400,000 in fees on housing deals. He 
had no housing expertise. He never looked at the projects he promoted. He only 
made a few phone calls and set up a brief meeting with a colleague from his 
Cabinet days, former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce delegated great authority to appointees picked by the Reagan White 
House. According to the Wall Street Journasl, his powerful executive assistant, 
Deborah Gore Dean, has described the federal rehabilitation and rent subsidy 
program as " . . . a political program . . . (run) in a political manner." 
</P>
<P>
As the questions multiply, Congress must demand answers, and it must strengthen 
the federal ethics laws governing lobbying by former insiders. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kemp, Pierce's successor, can stop the influence-peddling if he picks 
knowledgeable housing professionals to run HUD's programs. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp must insist on stronger supervision, a tighter monitoring system and 
accountability at every level. The process can preserve more dollars for the 
millions of Americans who need help to rent a decent apartment or buy a home.

THE SEWAGE IS NOT FOR DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, regulatory agencies and the courts have prodded the city of Los 
Angeles toward full secondary treatment of the sewage it dumps into Santa 
Monica Bay. As a result, the city has a massive sewage disposal modernization 
program under way and will achieve full secondary treatment of its effluent by 
1998. Now, the County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County are fighting 
the same losing battle that the city waged for so long. 
</P>
<P>
The districts have been seeking from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency a 
waiver -- the sort the city has worked under -- to exempt about half its 
effluent from the secondary treatment level required by the Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
The county districts have used a two-pronged argument in seeking partial 
exemption from the federal law. They claim that it would be more effective to 
work for source reduction -- to get industry and other sewage customers to keep 
toxic metals and other harmful effluent material from getting into the sewage 
system in the first place. But then, the districts claim it is important they 
continue to expel large amounts of solid matter from their Palos Verdes 
Peninsula outfall into the ocean because that continues to keep a blanket on 
top of DDT deposits dumped there back in the 1950s and 1960s. If the districts 
are required to provide a more refined level of treatment of the sewage, there 
will not be so much solid matter to spew onto the DDT dumps. 
</P>
<P>
The DDT claim might make some sense, says Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), 
except for the level of toxic metals, pesticides and other materials contained 
in the stuff that is being poured on top of the DDT. The waiver also has been 
opposed by state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), whose resolution 
asking the EPA to reject it has been approved by both houses of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the districts should be working toward both secondary treatment of 
the sewage and reduction of chemicals and metals at the source. There is a 
problem in disposing of the dry sludge that is left over from the secondary 
treatment process. But the County Sanitation Districts are not the first to 
have to cope with that matter. Better to deal with it on the level than just to 
dump it into the ocean.

IN DEFENSE OF THE CAMPUS REBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By I. F. STONE , From The I.F. Stone's Weekly Reader, edited by Neil Middleton. 
1971 by I.F. Stone. Reprinted by permission of Random House, Inc.

<TEXT>
<P>
May 19, 1969 
</P>
<P>
I hate to write on subjects about which I know no more than the conventional 
wisdom of the moment. One of these subjects is the campus revolt. My 
credentials as an expert are slim. I always loved learning and hated school. I 
wanted to go to Harvard, but I couldn't get in because I had graduated 
forty-ninth in a class of fity-two from a small-town high school. I went to 
college at the University of Pennsylvania which was obligated -- this sounds 
like an echo of a familiar black demand today -- to take graduates of high 
schools in neighboring communities no matter how ill-fitted. My boyhood idol 
was the saintly anarchist Kropotkin. I looked down on college degrees and felt 
that a man should do only what was sincere and true and without thought of 
mundane advancement. This provided lofty reasons for not doing homework. I 
majored in philosophy with the vague thought of teaching it but though I 
revered two of my professors I disliked the smell of a college faculty. I 
dropped out in my third year to go back to newspaper work. Those were the 
twenties and I was a pre-Depression radical. So I might be described I suppose 
as a premature New Leftist, though I never had the urge to burn anything down. 
</P>
<P>
In microcosm, the Weekly and I have become typical of our society. The war and 
the military have taken up so much of our energies that we have neglected the 
blacks, the poor and students. Seen from afar, the turmoil, and the deepening 
division appear to be a familiar tragedy, like watching a friend drink himself 
to death. Everybody knows what needs to be done, but the will is lacking. We 
have to break the habit. There is no excuse for poverty in a society which can 
spend $80 billion a year on its war machine. If national security comes first, 
as the spokesmen for the Pentagon tell us, then we can only reply that the 
clearest danger to the national security lies in the rising revolt of our black 
population. Our own country is becoming a Vietnam. As if in retribution for the 
suffering we have imposed, we are confronted by the same choices: either to 
satisfy the aspirations of the oppressed or to try and crush them by force. The 
former would be costly, but the latter will be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
This is what the campus rebels are trying to tell us, in the only way which 
seems to get attention. I do not like to hear opponents shouted down, much less 
beaten up. I do not like to hear any one group or class, including policemen, 
called pigs. I do not think four-letter words are arguments. I hate, hate, 
intolerance and violence. I see them as man's most ancient and enduring enemies 
and I hate to see them welling up on my side. But I feel about the rebels as 
Erasmus did about Luther. Erasmus helped inspire the Reformation but was 
repelled by the man who brought it to fruition. He saw that Luther was as 
intolerant and as dogmatic as the Church. "From argument," as Erasmus saw it 
(in Froude's "Life and Letters of Erasmus"), "there would be a quick resort to 
the sword, and the whole world would be full of fury and madness." Two 
centuries of religious wars without parallel for blood-lust were soon to prove 
how right were his misgivings. But while Erasmus "could not join Luther, he 
dared not oppose him, lest haply, as he confessed 'he might be fighting against 
the spirit of God.' " I feel that the New Left and the black revolutionists, 
like Luther, are doing God's work, too, in refusing any longer to submit to 
evil, and challenging society to reform or crush them. 
</P>
<P>
Lifelong dissent has more than acclimatized me cheerfully to defeat. It has 
made me suspicious of victory. I feel uneasy at the very idea of a Movement. I 
see every insight degenerating into a dogma, and fresh thoughts freezing into 
lifeless party line. Those who set out nobly to be their brother's keeper 
sometimes end up by becoming his jailer. Every emancipation has in it the seeds 
of a new slavery, and every truth easily becomes a lie. But these perspectives, 
which seem so irrefutably clear from a pillar in the desert, are worthless to 
those enmeshed in the crowded struggle. They are no better than mystical 
nonsense to the humane student who has to face his draft board, the dissident 
soldier who is determined not to fight, the black who sees his people doomed by 
shackles stronger than slavery to racial humiliation and decay. The business of 
the moment is to end the war, to break the growing dominance of the military in 
our society, to liberate the blacks, the Mexican-American, the Puerto Rican and 
the Indian from injustice. This is the business of our best youth. However 
confused and chaotic, their unwillingness to submit any longer is our one hope. 
</P>
<P>
There is a wonderful story of a delegation which came here to see Franklin D. 
Roosevelt on some reform or other. When they were finished the President said, 
"Okay, you've convinced me. Now go on out and bring pressure on me." Every 
thoughtful official knows how hard it is to get anything done if someone isn't 
making it uncomfortable not to. Just imagine how helpless the better people in 
government would be if the rebels, black and white, suddenly fell silent. The 
war might smoulder on forever, the ghettoes attract as little attention as a 
refuse dump. It is a painful business extricating ourselves from the stupidity 
of the Vietnamese war; we will do so only if it becomes more painful not to. It 
will be costly rebuilding the ghettoes, but if the black revolt goes on, it 
will be costlier not to. In the workings of a free society, the revolutionist 
provides the moderate with the clinching argument. And a little un-reason does 
wonders, like a condiment, in re-invigorating a discussion which has grown 
pointless and flat. 
</P>
<P>
We ought to welcome the revolt as the one way to prod us into a better America. 
To meet it with cries of "law and order" and "conspiracy" would be to relapse 
into the sterile monologue which precedes all revolutions. Rather than change 
old habits, those in power always prefer to fall back on the theory that all 
would be well but for a few malevolent conspirators. It is painful to see 
academia disrupted, but under the surface were shams and horrors that needed 
cleansing. The disruption is worth the price of awakening us. The student 
rebels are proving right in the daring idea that they could revolutionize 
American society by attacking the universities as its soft underbelly. But I 
would also remind the students that the three evils they fight -- war, racism 
and bureaucracy -- are universal. The Marxism-Leninism some of the rebels cling 
to has brought into power a bureaucracy more suffocating than any under 
capitalism; the students demonstrate everywhere on our side but are stifled on 
the other. War and imperialism have not been eliminated in the relations 
between Communist states. Black Africa, at least half-freed from the white man, 
is hardly a model of fraternity or freedom. Man's one real enemy is within 
himself. Burning America down is no way to Utopia. If battle is joined and our 
country polarized, as both the revolutionists and the repressionists wish, it 
is the better and not the worse side of America which will be destroyed. 
Someone said a man's character was his fate, and tragedy may be implicit in the 
character of our society and of its rebels. How make a whisper for patience 
heard amid the rising fury?

AGENDA FOR CLEANING UP OUR DIRTY AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have visited Los Angeles on business many times and have always enjoyed the 
many attractions this area has to offer. I have never before been here when 
there was no smog. I arrived here Memorial Day in the afternoon to get an early 
start on Tuesday installing a new computer system at one of my company's 
locations here. At first I thought what luck to see Los Angeles without smog. 
This did not sit well, however, because I have a bachelor of science degree in 
biology. I am not a great believer in luck. 
</P>
<P>
After a lot of thought it occurred to me that this was not luck, it was 
obvious: Mother Nature had three days of vacation from commuter traffic to 
flush out the atmosphere and let the natural systems handle the air pollutants. 
If the powers that be here declared Monday as an environmental holiday and 
forced into place three-day weekends and four-day work weeks it would end your 
smog problem. It would cut your commuter traffic 20% immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is truly a beautiful place to see when you can see more than a 
hundred yards!

ZSA ZSA'S ENCOUNTER WITH POLICE

Ms. Gabor admits her vehicle registration and driver's license were expired. 
She also admits having an open container of liquor in her car when stopped. She 
slapped the policeman who stopped her, and drove away because she didn't know 
what the "F" word meant. 
</P>
<P>
She then calls a news conference to announce she is "standing up for the 
battered women in America." It would appear she was really just standing up for 
all the cameras and as a result dealt a damaging blow to the issue of battered 
women.

In defense of our very fine police department I must tell you that the officer 
did not (as Gabor said) "make her sit in the middle of the street." 
</P>
<P>
He did what any good officer would do after being hit by a citizen: He 
handcuffed her wrists behind her back and sat her down on the curb while he 
conducted his investigation. I saw this with my own eyes.

BUSH'S VETO OF MINIMUM WAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever happened to "more gentler times" with all aspects of the 
cost-of-living being up and our President vetoes the minimum wage, yet seeks a 
tax cut for the higher-income earners? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps President Bush should spend more time fulfilling his campaign promise 
to the American people. 
</P>
<P>
It is deplorable to think that our present minimum wage cannot support a man 
who has even one child, not to mention those who have two or more. 
</P>
<P>
How are we to upgrade our influx of immigrants raising children here when they 
can hardly feed them, or educate them when the time comes? 
</P>
<P>
Those honest-working people looking for a chance for a better life are reduced 
to slave labor. We have opened one door and closed the other door at the very 
same time.

Even the most fanatical of the anti-smog zealots at the SCAQMD would probably 
agree that a 10% reduction of travel time in the metropolitan area would result 
in cleaner air. Such a reduction would be akin to the daily removal of 300,000 
to 400,000 vehicles from city streets on any given day. Instead, however, these 
pro-oxygen militants put forth overwhelming proposals for the imposition of 
draconian measures which could force us to become a bicycle society. 
</P>
<P>
Recent restrictions on rush-hour left turns implemented on Crescent Heights 
Boulevard have significantly improved traffic flow on this heavily traveled 
thoroughfare, with travel time between Culver City and Hollywood cut 
practically in half. At the same time, the bureaucrats' response to heavy 
congestion on La Cienega at the Beverly Center is the installation of mid-block 
traffic signals. If, however, the Traffic Department banned left turns into and 
out of the Beverly Center and the new mall across the street, traffic flow 
would improve at the expense of a few shoppers who would have to go around the 
block. 
</P>
<P>
Before we are all relegated to methanol-powered skate boards by the SCAQMD, I 
would suggest that the traffic flow problem be addressed. It doesn't require 
Manhattan Project mentality to deal with left turns, parking restrictions and 
synchronized signals.

Now that summer has formally arrived, smog season has, predictably, also 
arrived. We will be reminded to curb our outdoor activities during smog alerts, 
and everyone will feel the disabling effects of poor quality air. 
</P>
<P>
Substantial changes will have to take place in the Los Angeles area if air 
quality is to improve, and car-pool lanes and Metro Rail are a good start. 
</P>
<P>
Measures to further limit vehicle exhaust emissions should be aimed at the 
large trucks and buses that spew clouds of black diesel exhaust, creating 
sickening air for anyone in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
These trucks and buses are almost always owned by businesses that have the 
wherewithal to operate their vehicles in a non-polluting manner, and since 
private-party motorists are required to have their cars conform to strict smog 
specifications, then truck and bus lines should also have to adhere to the same 
stringent policies.

CRITICISM OF SOCIALIST NATIONS FOR RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY THE LEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. Alan M. Dershowitz's Op-Ed piece, "Leftist Cacophony for Human Rights 
Grows Silent on the Beijing Massacre" (June 11), is the last word in utter 
hypocrisy and falsehood. In essence, it accuses me and other individuals, 
organizations, and publications, identified by him as being spokespersons for 
the American left, of a "resounding chorus of silence" insofar as the Tian An 
Men Square blood bath is concerned. Referring to us all as "perennial 
democracy-bashers," he falsely and maliciously charges us with deliberately 
ignoring the tragic events of June 3-4 in Beijing because of our alleged 
unwillingness to criticize a socialist nation. 
</P>
<P>
I can only speak for myself but I can say that his assertion that "(my) office 
told his associate that (I) would have no comment" is an unspeakable lie. My 
office never received any inquiry from his unnamed "associate" and, indeed, it 
would have been passing strange if I had ever authorized such a claimed 
response when I have characterized the slaughter of the students on the "CBS 
Evening News" as "a massacre." Moreover, I know that a number of left-wing 
journals, such as the Guardian and the Revolutionary Worker, were far more 
condemnatory of the Chinese action than was the President of the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Dershowitz has attempted to wean Jewish lawyers away from 
representing Father Daniel Berrigan because he considered the activist Jesuit 
an anti-Semite for his political criticism of Israel. He has also encouraged a 
congressional witch hunt of the National Lawyers Guild because it did not 
accept his invitation to send an observer to the trial of Anatoly Shcharansky. 
Lastly, it might be noted that he has never once criticized a single act of the 
Israeli government, including the shooting of hundreds of young Palestinians on 
the occupied West Bank and that country's sale of weapons to Iran or its 
transshipment of American arms to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In the last analysis, he takes the position that, if others don't agree with 
his political priorities, they are "democracy-bashers." This is the height of 
intellectual arrogance but, when he buttresses his know-it-all-ism with 
outright falsehoods, he then has lost all right to be taken seriously.

AGENDA FOR CLEANING UP OUR DIRTY AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could someone please explain to me how Southern California could be a model 
("The Clean-Air Agenda," editorial, June 14) for many of President Bush's 
ideas. We have the dirtiest air in the nation, admittedly by everyone, and yet 
we will be probably the last ones to benefit from this new "so-called clean-air 
act." If we are models, then we certainly haven't followed our own examples. 
Where is this all coming from? Who is setting these examples, and where are 
they becoming reality? When you can smell, touch, and taste the air you breathe 
(cough, cough) then something is very wrong. 
</P>
<P>
I can't for the life of me understand how the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District can look anyone in the eye (with both eyes open) and say 
that we are working on a clean-air clean-up campaign and that it is only going 
to take 20 years to see it become a reality. We can all be dead by then. 
</P>
<P>
And what air do they breathe? Do they have some secret we don't know about? Get 
real! As long as smog can produce money, then we won't ever clean it up. It 
isn't profitable to clean up the air. The name of this game is G-R-E-E-D. It 
always has been and it always will be.

BO JACKSON MIXES ROUGH CUTS WITH PLENTY OF HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM LAYDEN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each night America gets its dose of Bo. Long after the kids have been tucked 
away and the dishes dried, he flashes across the television screen on news 
highlight films -- a blip of sensation and then gone. A running catch, a 
gargantuan home run or Bo's specialty, a bat splintered over some portion of 
his anatomy (first it was his knee, Wednesday night his head, which brings 
thanks that Bo isn't a shot putter). 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson is not so much a conventional athlete as a moment awaited, living 
anticipation. How far will the next ball fly? How fast can he run? How strong 
is his arm? Or the ultimate question: What might he be if he didn't play 
football, too? He dangles the answers tantalizingly by improving each year; he 
stops short of providing them by leaving holes in his game and leaving it 
altogether in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"If you watched just replays and highlights," Blue Jays scout Gordon Lakey 
said, "you'd think this guy was the greatest thing ever. Well, he's pretty 
good. He's just still a little rough around the edges." 
</P>
<P>
Tales of Bo, Part I, from Philadelphia Phillies scout Ray Shore: "I was 
watching him in Texas, and Nolan Ryan had struck him out six times in a row, 
twice in this game. Just kept throwing fastballs. Then he threw a couple under 
Bo's chin and got behind, 3-and-1. Well, Bo about hit the next one onto the 
runway out past the center-field fence." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson started cutting against the grain of public perception in the spring of 
1986, after he won the Heisman Trophy as college football's outstanding player 
and was the first player picked in the National Football League draft, by the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He decided to play baseball (at which he was good, but 
not preeminent) and was assigned by the Royals to their double-A team in 
Memphis, Tenn. His professional debut was covered by more than 150 media 
members; ABC-TV cut away from its Monday night baseball game to show Bo's first 
at-bat (a single chopped over second base), and the attention paid him masked 
his remarkable lack of qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Jones, the Memphis manager in 1986, remembers. "He was very, very raw," 
Jones said. "I mean, you had to be impressed by his sheer athletic skills, but 
he really had no feel for how the professional game was played. Defensively, 
when he reported to Memphis, he was no more prepared to play professional 
outfield than some guy who stepped off a beer-league softball diamond." 
</P>
<P>
After that first single, Bo went 0 for 29. "The Royals were calling me every 
day," Jones said. "They were questioning me, wondering if they made a mistake 
starting him at double-A." 
</P>
<P>
So that's where it began. Bo Jackson, 6-1 and 222 rippling pounds, one of the 
fastest human beings on the planet, began playing professional baseball -- 
because he wanted to -- basically as a novice. 
</P>
<P>
Tales of Bo, Part II, from Minnesota Twins scout Jerry Terrell: "Earlier this 
year, there were seven of us in the stands scouting the Royals. Bo hits a 
ground ball to short and we all time him down the line. I clicked my watch and 
I look at it and then I say, 'I didn't get him, I must have clicked it too 
soon. It's too fast.' One of the other guys says, 'What did you have?' I said, 
'Three-point-six-one (seconds).' They all did, too. Four-flat is fast from the 
left side, three-six-one from the right side, not on a bunt . . . unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics tell part of the story. Jackson is tied for the American League lead 
with 17 home runs, ranks fourth with 20 stolen bases and 46 runs scored, and is 
sixth with 48 RBI. "He's putting up numbers that rank him in the upper 
echelon," Boston Red Sox scout Frank Malzone said. "But numbers can be 
deceiving. He's coming across as winning a lot of ball games with hits and 
defensive plays, but we never hear about the shortcomings." 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the hail of Bo's Blows and Bo's Throws is a hard fact: He has been 
playing full-time baseball for barely three years and remains fundamentally 
deficient. As a rookie, Lakey said, "he didn't have good work habits at all." 
Now he does. But he is chasing players with five times his experience and -- 
enormous talent notwithstanding -- sometimes it shows. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting. Jackson's strikeout frequency has dropped, from one per 2.5 at-bats as 
a rookie to one per 3.42 this season. But he can still be had. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, just throw hard fastballs and you'll get him out," Terrell said. 
"Greg Swindell struck him out three times in Cleveland. Then he caught up with 
one and hit it out. That's the percentage you live with. He chases high 
pitches, he chases low pitches, and when he gets one, it jumps." 
</P>
<P>
Fielding. He is no longer the novice Jones was given in Memphis. Hours of 
shagging flies have improved him vastly. But he still uses his speed and his 
bounce to make up for a lack of technical expertise. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't get that pure jump on a ball that Devon White and Gary Pettis get," 
Lakey said. "And he gets turned around on balls he should catch. But he's 
improving. He has become a very fine defensive outfielder." 
</P>
<P>
Arm. By consensus, Jackson has the strongest arm in the American League. But he 
regularly throws through cutoff men, costing bases. "He can throw people out at 
the plate," Malzone said, "but then again, he can throw it into the stands." 
</P>
<P>
Tales of Bo, Part III, from Toronto Blue Jays scout Lakey: "There was one play 
he made at Royals Stadium. He went to the wall to rob a home run, and he was 
waiting, with his glove over the fence. The ball died and landed at his feet, 
so that made him look bad. But I'll tell you, that was an unbelievable play. 
That wall is 12 feet high and if that ball had been in the first couple rows, 
he would have caught it." 
</P>
<P>
The football thing is always there. Jackson has barely hit .200 after the 
All-Star break in his first two seasons. The theory is that he begins to think 
about the Los Angeles Raiders as the summer wanes toward September, abetted by 
the Royals' early departure from the pennant race. This summer, however, the 
Royals are in the race, trailing Oakland by only 2 1/2 games in the American 
League West. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond October, however, Jackson has given no indication that he will abandon 
his football career. On performance, there would seem no need to -- he is one 
of the most explosive running backs in the NFL. "But," Lakey said, "he has to 
be tired." 
</P>
<P>
He admits to no such weariness. He gives no clue as to his future, which has 
always been his way of doing business. He remains a gasp waiting to fill the 
throat, another fable to be recited. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's more than just some freak show," Jones said. "He's just in his own 
category."

MORGAN CAN'T DO IT ALONE, SO DODGERS LOSE IN CINCINNATI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
His team lost to the Cincinnati Reds, 3-1, Friday night, and normally that's 
all Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda would have seen. That's all he would have felt, 
or been able to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
But in this town, where a hero's reputation is coming apart in a manner as slow 
and uncomfortable as the Midwestern midsummer days, these are not normal times. 
After the Dodgers wasted 10 hits and another fine start by Mike Morgan, Lasorda 
chose to talk about something he saw an hour before the game. 
</P>
<P>
It was Red Manager Pete Rose entering an empty dugout and grabbing a piece of 
green railing and just hanging there, staring at the field, for the longest 
time, alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked over there today and saw Pete . . . you rarely see Pete out early 
like that, and alone," Lasorda said. "I thought, how sad he must be feeling 
right now. I thought, what is going through his mind right now? 
</P>
<P>
"He finally looked over at me, and I went like this . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda gestured with his thumb up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long, long tough ordeal for him," Lasorda said. "All I can say is, 
I hope he didn't bet on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
That sort of hope was severely damaged Thursday when baseball's special 
investigator, John Dowd, testified that he has substantial evidence Rose bet 
heavily on baseball games, including Red games. This sort of evidence could 
lead to Rose being banned from the game for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there is still a season to play, and Rose and the Reds were there to play 
Friday night before a crowd of 33,933. While it may have seemed strange to see 
Rose calmly managing, and then calmly answering baseball-only questions 
afterward, what didn't seem strange was that the Dodgers could not take 
advantage of the distractions. 
</P>
<P>
They let Red starter Jose Rijo off the hook during rallies in the fourth and 
fifth innings, then blew another rally in the ninth after loading the bases 
with one out. Overall, it was the 29th game (out of 71) in which the Dodgers 
have scored two or fewer runs. They have won four of those games. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to start picking each other up -- that hasn't happened all year," said 
Alfredo Griffin, who doubled twice while going three for four to extend his 
hitting streak to eight games and raise his average to a season-high .250. "We 
get two guys that start hitting, and then six guys go in a slump. We can't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
They can't have innings like the ninth, which typified an entire season in 10 
minutes. Against Red reliever John Franco, who appeared ready to blow a save 
opportunity for only the third time in 21 tries this year, pinch-hitter Mariano 
Duncan led off with a single to center. After Jeff Hamilton struck out, 
pinch-hitter Jose Gonzalez grounded a single that shortstop Barry Larkin 
knocked down and threw late to second, and then Griffin bounced a single up the 
middle to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Up came pinch-hitter Rick Dempsey, who has had a couple of hits and RBIs (in 
nine at-bats) in that role this year. He took a low pitch for a ball, and then 
his eyes got wide. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ahead of him and thought I could make him give me my pitch," Dempsey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His eyes got so wide, he couldn't wait. He swung at the next pitch, a sinker, 
and grounded it sharply to Larkin, who started an easy game-ending double play. 
As quickly and forcefully as Dempsey spiked his batting helmet behind first 
base, Franco had his league-leading 19th save, and the Dodgers fell one game 
under .500 again. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Reds improved to 39-32, winning yet another game while playing 
without outfielders Eric Davis (sore hamstring) and Kal Daniels (sore ankle). 
The record leads some to wonder: Under these worst of circumstances, could Rose 
be doing his best managing? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not thinking of the Reds and their problems," Dempsey said. "We've got 
enough of our own." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was thinking the same thing. He let the Reds score in only one of his 
six innings pitched -- two runs in the third on a run-scoring single by Larkin 
and ensuing run-scoring double by Paul O'Neill. And if it hadn't been for the 
ball Morgan punched into right field for an RBI single in the fifth, the 
Dodgers would not have scored. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan left the game after six innings, his league-leading ERA moving up 
slightly to 1.64. But because he is pitching for a team that has scored two or 
fewer runs in eight of his 13 starts, his record fell to 5-6. And like every 
pitcher on this staff, he wonders. 
</P>
<P>
"I've given them a chance to win in all but one of my 13 starts, and we've won 
seven of them (including two no-decisions)," he said. "I've done all I can do. 
We have our chances but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Besides the ninth-inning rally, the Dodgers also put runners on first and 
second with none out in the fourth after Willie Randolph and Eddie Murray hit 
consecutive singles. But Mike Davis, Mike Scioscia and Jeff Hamilton were 
unable to get the ball out of the infield against Rijo, who left with back 
spasms after five innings but was still effective enough (one allowed run) to 
improve his record to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the fifth, when the Dodgers put together four hits and could 
only score one run, the inning ending, perhaps fittingly, with Morgan being 
thrown out at home plate by center fielder Herm Winningham while trying to 
score from second on a single by Murray. 
</P>
<P>
And the Dodgers' own ordeal continues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like every game this year," Lasords said, "was like this one." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The treatment of two banners at Riverfront Stadium Friday provided an 
interesting sidelight to the Pete Rose situation. One banner, reading "Pete 
Forever -- Bart Never," referring to Rose and baseball Commissioner Bart 
Giamatti, was torn down by security personnel after hanging for five minutes. 
Another banner, reading, "Bring Back Sparky," in reference to former Red 
manager Sparky Anderson, remained on display the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was the first day that both Dodger left-handed pitchers John Tudor and 
Ray Searage were healthy and ready to throw. Yet, because of a pitching staff 
backlog that can't be loosened by Fred Claire, executive vice president of 
player personnel, both pitchers remain ineligible. "I guess when they're ready, 
they'll let me know," Searage said. "When it gets to a certain point, I'll go 
ask Fred." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have released veteran outfielder Dave Collins and brought up 
right-handed reliever Mike Griffin from triple-A Nashville, Tenn. Collins, 36, 
played for seven different major league teams in parts of 14 seasons, including 
Cincinnati twice. He was hitting .233 as a part-time player, and Rose said, "He 
has to hit, because he can't play defense as well as what we've got."

WHAT'S IN A NAME? MORE THAN MEETS EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his June 17 letter to Viewpoint, Bruce Carnachan suggests that the Chevrolet 
Indy V-8 engine should not be referred to by its proper name but rather as the 
"Ilmor" or "Ilmor-Chevrolet." 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet did not merely spend "millions of dollars to put its name on the 
valve covers," as Carnachan suggests. Eleven Chevrolet and General Motors 
engineering groups, working across the United States, from Santa Barbara to 
Rochester, N.Y., have contributed a great deal of American technology to this 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
The original contract specifies that the engine be formally named the Chevrolet 
Indy V-8. 
</P>
<P>
Carnachan's corruption of the name is illogical as someone suggesting that he 
be called "Glen Dale Carnachan" because he happens to live in Glendale.

IT'S NOT FIRST TIME SLUGGER HAS HIT LEADOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have to agree with Scott Ostler's defense of Tom Lasorda's decision to use 
Kirk Gibson in the leadoff spot, although the glowing results to date are 
self-evident. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a precedent for Lasorda's move. 
</P>
<P>
When Willie Mays was at his pinnacle in the mid- to late 1950s, an All-Star 
manager received similar umbrage over his decision to have Mays lead off. 
However, the National League lineup was so loaded that the manager drooled at 
the prospect of affording Mays an extra at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
I wish I could remember the results of Mays' efforts.

<P>
 Editor's note: It wasn't rare for Mays to lead off in All-Star games. He did 
it eight times. The first six times (1958, twice in '60, '65, '66, '68), his 
totals were 10 hits in 23 at-bats with eight runs scored. In '70 and '71, the 
last two times he led off, he was hitless in five at-bats overall.

Question: Why did George Raveling have to interview for the head coaching job 
at the University of Maryland before he decided that it was important for him 
to keep his commitment to his USC players? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: $$$$$$$ 
</P>
<P>
If Raveling's players aren't any more committed to the team than he is, it 
might help to explain their poor record since Raveling became their coach.

FOR A CHANGE, MAHORN TAKES A FEW SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Downey's article on the Detroit Pistons' Rick Mahorn was so brutally 
vicious that I will certainly remember it for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Downey engaged in merciless butchery of the "Bad Boy," outright destruction of 
Mahorn's dignity. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one thing that I can say to Downey after he so utterly attacked 
Mahorn, the Charles Manson of the basketball court . . .

TENNIS ROUNDUP;

NAVRATILOVA AND REGGI REACH EASTBOURNE FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martina Navratilova won her ninth match in nine days, defeating Ros Fairbank 
Friday to reach the final of the women's grass-court tennis championships at 
Eastbourne, England. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, 14th-seeded Raffaella Reggi beat Gigi Fernandez, 6-4, 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova won easily, 6-3, 6-2, unlike last year at Wimbledon when she 
trailed Fairbank, 5-2, in the final set of their quarterfinal match before 
prevailing. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, 32, admitted that she had last year's Wimbledon match in mind. "I 
wanted to avenge myself a bit -- even though I won last year it was pretty 
dicey," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank held her serve only once in the first set and won only three points in 
the first three games of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said she is happy with her pre-Wimbledon program, although the many 
matches have taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty grinding emotionally, but it will stand me in good stead at 
Wimbledon (starting Monday)," she said, adding that she was disappointed at not 
being able to face Chris Evert, who withdrew because of an ear infection, in 
the final today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to have played Chris, but I'm sure we'll play again before she 
retires," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Reggi, a clay-court specialist, hit some excellent volleys to overcome the 
erratic Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker of West Germany outlasted Dan Goldie, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2), to advance 
to the final of a grass-court tournament at Wirral, England. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, a two-time Wimbledon champion, will play for the title today against 
Peter Lundgren of Sweden, who defeated Carl-Uwe Steeb of West Germany, 7-6 
(7-2), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Becker won the first set by breaking Goldie's serve in the 10th game. The West 
German got a another service break to go up, 5-3, in the second set, but Goldie 
broke back when Becker double-faulted and then netted a forehand. 
</P>
<P>
In the tiebreaker, it was Goldie's turn to miss his forehand. He hit one long 
and one into the net as Becker won, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
The semifinal had its lighter moments. 
</P>
<P>
The West German, whose service had not been up to its usual standards in his 
quarterfinal match, served three aces in a row to take a 40-0 lead in the fifth 
game of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Goldie sat down in mock defeat, commenting: "The papers said you were serving 
badly." 
</P>
<P>
Becker said the match was his best yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Until 6-4, 5-3, I was playing very well, but I then played two or three bad 
shots," he said. "I was hoping I would be able to play four matches and 
hopefully tomorrow I will make it four wins out of four. Things couldn't have 
been better for me so far." 
</P>
<P>
Nick Brown of Britain, ranked 467th in the world, defeated Richard Matuszewski, 
6-2, 4-6, 6-3, in the semifinals of the Bristol Grand Prix men's grass-court 
tournament at Bristol, England. 
</P>
<P>
In today's final, Brown will play Eric Jelen of West Germany, who blew two 
match points before winning a marathon from Michiel Schapers of the 
Netherlands, 3-6, 6-3, 13-11. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszewski, seeded second in the tournament and ranked No. 61, won the second 
set with a service break in the 10th game but was not able to keep pace with 
the big serve of Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia was upset by Sweden's Jonas Svensson in a 
round-robin grass-court tournament at Wentworth, England, but the world's 
top-ranked player said he wasn't worried about Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really pleased with the way everything has gone in the past two weeks," 
Lendl said after Svensson won, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Svensson's victory moved Kevin Curren into the final of the round-robin event 
because the American had the better record in sets. Curren will face Sweden's 
Mats Wilander, who advanced by defeating Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland, 7-6 
(7-5), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander blew four set points, at 5-3 in the first set, against Hlasek before 
winning the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Claudio Mezzadri of Switzerland and Juan Aguilera of Spain, both unseeded, 
advanced to the semifinals of a clay-court tournament at Bari, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Mezzadri defeated seventh-seeded Franco Davin of Argentina, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
Aguilera beat Pedro Rebolledo of Chile, 6-4, 6-2.

<P>
SAUGUS DRIVER FINED, SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY FOR ROLE IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stock car driver who has admitted to deliberately making contact with the car 
of another driver, triggering a fiery crash Saturday night at Saugus Speedway, 
has been fined $500 and suspended indefinitely by NASCAR officials, NASCAR 
spokesman Owen Kearns Jr. said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard DeLong Sr. of Castaic also has been placed on probation for the 
remainder of the season, Kearns said, for his involvement in a collision with 
the car driven by Chuck Pittenger of Northridge in the 15-lap semi-main event 
of the NASCAR Southwest Tour program. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns would not speculate on the length of the suspension but said that NASCAR 
will continue to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people who have been suspended indefinitely reinstated," he said. 
"And some have never been reinstated. It's hard to say." 
</P>
<P>
No action was taken against Pittenger, who was not hurt in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
DeLong, 52, who suffered a broken left foot and minor burns, said this week 
that he attempted to "spin out" Pittenger, who, DeLong claimed, had caused him 
to spin out two laps earlier. DeLong said that he probably will appeal the 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
According to NASCAR rules, an appeal must be filed within 10 days with the 
National Stock Car Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"It upsets me a little that all the facts weren't taken into consideration," 
DeLong said. "I don't feel that (NASCAR) has all the knowledge and all the 
facts. I should be punished. But he should be punished too." 
</P>
<P>
DeLong claimed that Pittenger had deliberately bumped his car earlier in the 
race while making a pass in Turn 2. DeLong, who spun into the infield and out 
of a chance to qualify for that evening's 125-lap main event, said he likely 
will provide NASCAR with a videotape of the race to support his claim. 
</P>
<P>
"They should look at his car more carefully," DeLong said. "That incident 
should not be overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
Pittenger, 44, who was not penalized by track officials for the pass, admitted 
to making contact with DeLong but said he was not at fault. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess this (decision) means that they found something wrong with what he did 
and not with what I did," Pittenger said. 
</P>
<P>
Pittenger, who entered the evening second in the Southwest Tour points 
standings, was in second place and challenging for the lead entering Turn 3 of 
Lap 12. But DeLong, a part-time tour competitor, appeared to make contact with 
the rear of Pittenger's car and sent both vehicles slamming into the wall in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
DeLong, who said Monday that he regretted the crash but not his intentions, 
conceded that he might have acted out of anger. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I regret it," he said. "If I had it to do all over again, I would have 
pulled into the infield and had the officials look at my right front tire. It 
had his orange paint all over it. He did enough to take me out and bend a 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for the way it turned out, what I did is no worse than what he did. If 
the officials had been on top of things, this wouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
DeLong, who said that his foot will be in a cast for four weeks, did not rule 
out returning to racing this season. Pittenger, who intends to compete in 
today's Southwest Tour race in Madera, considers the matter closed. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever they've decided is fine with me," he said. "I'm done. I'm not going 
to do anything else. But my car owner is not too happy about the damage." 
</P>
<P>
Pittenger said that the car sustained body, frame and wheel damage, as well as 
fire damage to its wiring. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Phillips of Palmdale, owner of the car Pittenger drives, could not be 
reached for comment.

KERRY HOPPS REMAINS TRUE TO GOLF TRADITIONS IN ROLE AS CLUB PRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Older male golfers -- usually the ones who wear those neat, 
just-above-the-ankle, lime green polyester pants with tiny walruses on them -- 
like to tell the joke about a man stuck on the course behind a group of 
incredibly slow women golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after watching them hack their way through five holes in about four 
hours, he bellows an insult that causes one of the women to stalk back down the 
fairway and confront him. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the matter?" the woman asked, "Don't you like playing behind women 
golfers?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know," the man responded. "I've never seen one." 
</P>
<P>
If any male golfing member of the Woodland Hills Country Club would like to 
spend the rest of his life getting those oh-so-hard-to-get 4:15 a.m. or 9:45 
p.m. tee times for the rest of his life, all he has to do is tell that joke to 
the club's head golf professional. 
</P>
<P>
She is Kerry Hopps, one of only two women to hold down the top pro job at a 
public or private golf club in the Los Angeles area. Of the more than 6,000 
such jobs in the nation, only 38 of them are currently filled by women, 
according to the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more and more women playing golf every day in this country," Hopps 
said, "and I think you'll start to see more and more women serving as the head 
golf professionals at courses. But for now, it's a pretty small group. For me, 
it was just a natural progression. I played golf since the age of 5, played in 
high school and college and just continued on here. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine having another job. I love this so much. The people at the 
Woodland Hills Country Club are like family to me. And when your office is this 
green and beautiful, there's just no other job like it." 
</P>
<P>
Hopps, 30, played golf for the Rio Mesa High team in Camarillo and then played 
for the Cal State Northridge squad that won three conference championships 
between 1977 and 1980. During her collegiate career she began working at the 
Woodland Hills Country Club part time. She eventually was named one of the 
club's assistant pros and in 1983 was promoted to head professional. 
</P>
<P>
"When I began playing seriously in high school, and even during my college 
days, golf seemed to be a much more male-dominated sport," Hopps said. "But 
following the progression of everything in the world, women are doing more and 
more and taking on jobs once held exclusively by men." 
</P>
<P>
Hopps wants it known, however, that she is not a banner-waving feminist. She is 
first and foremost, she points out quickly, a golfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in no way a women's libber type," she said. "I worked hard to get here, 
but I'm in this for the golf and the life around a golf course, not to set any 
examples for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
And if that doesn't make a militant feminist want to slug Hopps with a pair of 
construction boots, perhaps the schedule of events at Hopps' golf course might. 
On Saturday until 11 a.m. and Sunday until 9 a.m., no women need lace on the 
spikes. It's men only during those hours, which, by the way, are the prime 
golfing hours each week. The women get exclusive use of the course each Tuesday 
and on a few other selected days each month. 
</P>
<P>
Such rules are common at private country clubs. But at the Woodland Hills 
Country Club, with its woman head professional, it seems a bit more unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tradition," Hopps said. "Through time golf has always been broken down 
like this. The thought when the tradition began is that men work all week and 
they only have Saturday and Sunday to play golf. The women could play during 
the week because they didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"But, I have never received any complaints about our schedule. The men think 
it's OK and the women think it's OK too. They adjust their schedules and play 
Saturday and Sunday afternoons. And I really don't want to get dragged into a 
long conversation about this. As I've said, I'm a golf pro. That's all." 
</P>
<P>
Hopps said that she was never inclined to give the LPGA a shot, leaving the 
fierce competitiveness of professional high-stakes tournaments to those with 
more of a killer instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"I just never leaned towards the LPGA," she said. "It's an awfully tough life 
out there. For me it was a question of mental toughness more than a talent 
thing. I honestly don't think I have that mental toughness that it would take. 
There's such tremendous pressure on those women. 
</P>
<P>
"When I worked here as an assistant pro I found that I liked it so much, I just 
never thought about doing anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Hopps also found something else during her early years as a teaching assistant 
at the club. She found Paul Hopps, who was then playing golf for Pierce College 
and is now an assistant pro at Rancho Park course in West Los Angeles. They are 
married, and wouldn't you just love to see the millions of golf shoe spike 
marks in their kitchen linoleum? 
</P>
<P>
And, if you happen to be walking by their home at 4 a.m. nearly any day and 
hear loud bells ringing, relax. There is no burglary in progress nor any fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the alarm clock," Kerry Hopps said. "The life of a teaching golf pro 
means getting up before the sun. There aren't many days that our alarm doesn't 
go off at 4 o'clock and we're off to our separate golf courses for the day. It 
may seem crazy, but there's nothing like it."

STARTING A NEW CYCLE; 
</P>
<P>
JOHN WILLIAMS EXCHANGED HIS BASKETBALL FOR A BICYCLE AND RESOLUTELY PEDALED TO 
A BERTH ON TEAM USA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The colors seized him. Splashes of reds, yellows, blues, greens. They poured 
past the ever-widening eyes of John Williams so swiftly he could hardly 
distinguish where one hue started and the next began. 
</P>
<P>
His expression was that of a youthful Norman Rockwell subject staring into a 
kaleidoscope for the first time. He leaned closer, squinted, then pulled back, 
trying to focus on the array of darting figures before him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was blown away," said Williams, still fascinated by the vision four years 
later. "Just the colors, there was so much accent. I didn't even know what was 
going on, but I was so into it." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 25, known as Scooter since childhood, was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
He had experienced more than a roadside view of his first cycling race. The 
Mountain View Criterium, which the small town just south of Palo Alto no longer 
plays host to, served as Williams' direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting there watching that race," Williams said, "I decided I wanted to race 
bikes." 
</P>
<P>
This April, 3 1/2 years later, Williams received a tattered envelope. Several 
forwarding addresses were scribbled over the face of the letter, which 
eventually landed in the mailbox at his parents' home in Agoura Hills. In the 
upper-left corner was the emblem of the United States Cycling Federation. 
</P>
<P>
The note inside, signed by USCF Executive Director Mark Hodges, asked Williams 
to race for Team USA, the Olympic development program based in Colorado 
Springs, Colo. Williams treated the correspondence like it had Ed McMahon's 
picture on it. 
</P>
<P>
Am I the John Williams whose life is about to change? 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally a shock to me," he said. "I got this letter and thought it was 
a mistake. I actually called Mark Hodges to say, 'This is John Williams. I 
received a letter. Are you sure I'm the right person?' " 
</P>
<P>
Hodges, who had heard reviews of Williams' racing through a track manager at a 
San Jose velodrome, assured him he was. 
</P>
<P>
"John's going to be quite an asset to Team USA in the future," Hodges said. 
"He's really, really fast. I see him challenging some of the guys in '92." 
</P>
<P>
That's 1992, as in the Year of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the trail from criterium clod to Olympic hopeful can be considered smooth 
only if one takes into account the trials preceding. 
</P>
<P>
Scooter Williams was first and foremost a basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-2, he was an All-Camino Real League guard while at Serra High, a 
private, all-boys school in Gardena. Before graduating in 1982, Scooter three 
times led the Cavaliers as far as the playoff quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Scooter, of course, is a basketball player's nickname. Cyclists are called Ulf 
or Franz or Alexi, and are not given nicknames because their real names are so 
colorful anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when Hodges received a recent inquiry about "this Scooter Williams 
kid," he asked, "Scooter who? You mean, John Williams?" 
</P>
<P>
Uh, right. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was raised a mere double-dribble from the Great Western Forum, when it 
was known simply as Fabulous. He mixed it up on the playgrounds of Inglewood 
with the likes of Laker Byron Scott, former UCLA and Boston Celtic swingman 
Kenny Fields and Milwaukee Buck guard Jay Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
He was going to be a basketball player and in 1982 headed off to Stanford with 
a full scholarship and a world of expectations packed neatly away in his duffel 
bag. What he found instead was a new coach -- Tom Davis -- new rules, and, 
finally, a situation that became very demoralizing. 
</P>
<P>
In three seasons at Stanford, Williams scored 49 points and had 22 rebounds. He 
played in just 16 games. In 1984, at the start of his junior season, he 
suffered a stress fracture in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
Still not healed, Williams red-shirted his senior season with the intention of 
returning. He never played for the Cardinal again. 
</P>
<P>
When healthy, he got little playing time. When injured, little encouragement. 
So Scooter Williams began his arduous transition to John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he placed much of the blame on Davis, whose first season at 
Stanford coincided with Williams'. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was there, it got to the point I wanted to leave," Williams said. "I 
thought of transferring. Several times, I'd sit in my room and cry. 
</P>
<P>
"I took myself away from the players, the involvement, the people. People I 
loved. Friendships I had formed that are, now, still really good friendships. 
It was quite an emotional time for me. I hated him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like to come home to see my high school friends, because I was 
embarrassed that I didn't play. I was supposed to play." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who now coaches at the University of Iowa, remembers Williams as a 
"unique" and "lively" personality and recalls his emotional difficulties as 
relatively typical. 
</P>
<P>
"What he was going through was normal," Davis said. "I think any time you're 
looking at players who are not in the starting lineup or the starting rotation, 
it's always a difficult relationship. It's just a matter of trying to accept 
that role and not being broken by it. I thought Scooter was handling it well." 
</P>
<P>
On the exterior, perhaps. But Novian Whitsitt, a friend and fellow guard at 
Stanford, saw a hurt in Williams' eyes that far exceeded the hurt in his right 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
"Scoot usually didn't wear his heart on his sleeve," said Whitsitt, who works 
for the Pacific 10 Conference in Walnut Creek. "But if you knew him, you knew 
he was in a lot of pain. 
</P>
<P>
"There were conflicts with the coaches. He felt he should be playing more. And 
then the injuries came. Scoot was a talent in basketball that really went 
untapped." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, attempting to draw one more basketball season from what was once a 
wellspring of promise, spent several hours a day in the training room during 
the latter part of his junior year. The recovery process included tedious 
sessions on a stationary bike, when he stared at the same concrete wall day 
after day, rigorously pumping to the beat of his own rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to break away from the training room, Williams bought his first racing 
bike -- a secondhand, $650 Italian-made Somec. The original owner threw in a 
pair of tattered cleats to seal the deal. Whitsitt, who set up the transaction, 
took Williams on his first ride through the hills of Palo Alto the same day. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worn out," Williams said. "I think it was about a 20-mile ride. And what 
seemed like really large hills were just rollers." 
</P>
<P>
Not long after that ride, on a warm Sunday afternoon, Williams and his 
girlfriend, Alicia Costantino, mounted their bikes for a lazy ride through 
Stanford's surrounding communities. They happened upon Mountain View and the 
rainbow of racers. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed there the whole day," Williams said. "On the way home, I remember 
having a real good ride because I was so hyper about it. I went home and shaved 
my legs. I was going to look the part." 
</P>
<P>
All that was left was to become the part. 
</P>
<P>
When his training regimen finally reached what he considered a competitive 
level, Williams registered for a race in San Jose on Memorial Day weekend, 
1986. He bought his first hard-shell helmet the night before. As it turned out, 
he never really got going fast enough to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Four miles into the race, he was dead tired. Six miles in, 36 miles from the 
finish line, he was lucky. The rear tire of his used Somec found a piece of 
glass and blew out. Williams was done, and somewhat wiser for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad," he admitted with a typically wide smile. "I got off, picked up my 
tire, and went back. I was really kinda happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew after that I would have to start working." 
</P>
<P>
Williams became a regular on the hills and paths in and around Palo Alto. He 
joined the Stanford Cycling Club and enlisted the help of experienced cyclists 
in the Bay Area. Upon graduation from Stanford in January, 1988, Williams put 
his degree in economics to good use by manning the cash register at a local 
bike shop. 
</P>
<P>
Then, another race, this one at UC Irvine. And, another disaster. 
</P>
<P>
With his friends and family in the crowd, Williams was buried again. 
</P>
<P>
"I got dropped," he said flatly. "No flats, no excuses. I just got dropped. And 
I was so embarrassed. I was coughing after the race. It was so hot and I was 
just winded. I vowed to myself at that point, that I would never be that 
embarrassed again." 
</P>
<P>
John Williams was obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough came in the second race of the 1988 season. The evidence hangs 
over the Williams' family Mercedes in their two-car garage. The old Somec is 
suspended on two nails. Along the head tube, just above the front fork, a 
serpent-like gouge rakes all the way to the underlying metal. Williams pointed 
to the scar and recalled a day in Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I was training hard, getting stronger," he said. "In that race, I crashed, got 
up and finished 12th. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I knew I could compete. I knew I could finish a race." 
</P>
<P>
Top 10 finishes started to come, including a fifth in the California road 
racing championships in Lancaster early this month. 
</P>
<P>
He had come a long way from the day he cheered a blown tire. The tears he had 
shed in his Stanford bedroom were all but forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"John is real, real intense," Hodges said. "Almost too intense sometimes. It's 
sometimes like he's striving to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"It usually takes quite a bit of time to develop these skills, but we'll have 
him for at least the next three years. I know he's a heck of a rider." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that he would officially sign with Team USA after this year's 
USCF Senior National and Road Criterium, held July 11-20 in Park City, Utah. 
Team USA provides a monthly stipend, coaching, mechanical support, equipment 
and clothing. His goal is a top 10 finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of thrive on the pain of it now," he said. "When I first started it, I 
quit when I hurt. I like the pain of it now. I like climbing and hurting. I 
enjoy hearing people suffering behind me. I enjoy that feeling."

JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES GETS THE JOB HE 'ALWAYS WANTED'; 
</P>
<P>
VERSATILE ASSISTANT COACH WILLARD TO LEAD BASEBALL PROGRAM AT CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Willard was selected Friday to replace Ken Wagner as Camarillo High 
varsity baseball coach, just three days after Wagner accepted a similar 
position at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Thompson, Camarillo athletic director, said he notified the other 
candidates -- Al Tarazon of Channel Islands High, Mark Morrison of Buena High 
and former Cal State Northridge Coach Terry Craven -- of Willard's appointment 
before their scheduled interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at the situation and decided we better make a decision," Thompson 
said. "With Jack, we had a really good candidate on campus." 
</P>
<P>
A shortage of teaching openings at the school contributed to the decision, 
which was finalized earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Willard, 31, has worked at Camarillo for nine years and is a full-time English 
teacher. He attended Camarillo and played baseball and football for the 
Scorpions before graduating in 1976. He went on to play two seasons of baseball 
at Moorpark College and another at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Willard's coaching experience includes three seasons as Camarillo girls' 
basketball coach, the past two seasons as softball coach, one season as 
Camarillo's American Legion baseball coach and one season as a varsity baseball 
assistant. He also is a varsity football assistant and will continue to coach 
girls' basketball. 
</P>
<P>
He takes over a baseball program that last qualified for the playoffs in 1986. 
The Scorpions were 12-13 in 1989 and tied for fourth in the Marmonte League 
with a 5-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved to have the kind of job I've always wanted," Willard said. "You 
see other people getting jobs and kind of wonder when your shot will be." 
</P>
<P>
He said his first goal is to lead the Scorpions back to the playoffs, via the 
practice field. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a two-hour-a-day person," he said. "I just don't work that way. I have 
a lot of motivation toward practice, and I always have. 
</P>
<P>
"One great fear, as far as being a coach and a teacher, is a lack of 
preparation. I will do anything to avoid being unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
To Thompson, Willard is a known commodity. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack brings a lot of intensity to the program," he said. "He has a lot of 
enthusiasm, and so did Ken. So I see it as a continuation of the program."

PIANIST SULTANOV: A CONQUERING WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than two weeks after winning the eighth Van Cliburn International Piano 
Competition in Ft. Worth, Tex., Aleksei Sultanov on Thursday night launched an 
extended period of fulfilling the concert engagements that come along with his 
gold medal. The 19-year-old Soviet citizen gave a sold-out recital to an 
overflow audience at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
And, unlike the last three Cliburn winners who began their post-competition 
tour with a first stop in Pasadena (in 1977, 1981 and 1985) and later returned 
with disappointing results, Sultanov conquered immediately -- and 
unequivocally. 
</P>
<P>
More important than his musical and technical credentials -- which seem 
perfectly in order and even surpass in some respects the standard we have come 
to expect from international competitors -- is Sultanov's personality. 
</P>
<P>
He has one. It seems individual, perhaps even unique. And the impassioned, 
articulate and sensitive playing that flows from his arms and fingers with the 
naturalness of a lion's roar or a bird's cooing expresses something more -- 
much more -- than mere good training, as cherishable a quality as that may be. 
It expresses a successful bonding between performer and listener. 
</P>
<P>
Playing an old-fashioned (some might even say hackneyed) debut program 
consisting of well-worn sonatas by Mozart, Beethoven and Prokofiev and 
too-common showpieces by Chopin and Liszt, Sultanov distinguished himself in 
every way. And won hearts in the process. 
</P>
<P>
He probed familiar works with a bright but never perverse imagination. He 
reinstated appropriately the conversational flow of musical sentences most of 
his listeners could recite by themselves. And he heated up these chestnuts to 
their full flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's "Appassionata" Sonata became a celebration -- and not for a moment 
a cerebration -- of direct communication from pianist to audience. Sultanov 
gave it the full range of his dynamic interests, caressed the inner workings of 
the great slow movement, then rode the finale to a glory to which many aspire 
but few achieve. 
</P>
<P>
In a very few moments, his Mozart -- the Sonata in C, K. 330 -- went beyond the 
limits of style and restraint. But, in general, it purled along, made sense as 
music, and stayed in its own century. Prokofiev's sure-fire Seventh Sonata 
seemed, after the fact, a tad contrived -- Sultanov may by now have earned the 
right to be tired of it -- yet it emerged as predictably effective and 
hair-raising as any reiteration of it we have heard in this locale. 
</P>
<P>
The compact, tireless pianist seemed most at home in the display mode of 
Chopin's B-flat minor Scherzo and Liszt's "Mephisto" Waltz, where his accuracy, 
speed and passionate delivery gave them a surprising freshness. 
</P>
<P>
In an evening of quick responses and hyperactive tempos, Sultanov saved the 
fastest for last: His two encores were both by Chopin, the "Grand Valse 
Brillante" in E-flat; and the "Revolutionary" Etude.

PBS OFFERS THREE-PART GROUP THEATRE SALUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is well known these days that you don't just go out and start a theater. You 
need a building committee, a site search, a fund drive and many, many press 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
This was not known in 1931. Dissatisfied with the light-minded shows that 
Broadway was offering, Harold Clurman and his colleagues decided to start their 
own theater. They would find new plays that showed what was really going on in 
Depression America. They would perform them like artists, not like a stock 
company. They would change the world! 
</P>
<P>
Their theater would not be a building. It would be a . . . group. Artistic 
decisions, however, would come down from the top. Clurman wasn't that much of a 
democrat. Money? Well -- as the house dramatist, Clifford Odets, would put it 
years later -- "life shouldn't be printed on dollar bills." Somehow, the money 
would be there. 
</P>
<P>
It was, too -- when the Group had a hit ("Men in White" in '33 or "Awake and 
Sing" in '35). When it had a flop, no. And it had many more flops than hits. In 
1941, Clurman turned the lock in the office door and the Group was a memory. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, the memory never went away. The Group turned out so many great directors 
and teachers that its influence continues down to the present. Is there a major 
American actor who hasn't studied, or hasn't pretended to have studied, with 
"Lee" (Strasberg) or 'Sandy" (Sanford Meisner) or "Stella" (Adler) or "Bobby" 
(Lewis)? 
</P>
<P>
Stella and Bobby were on hand last Sunday night at the Mark Taper Forum for a 
preview of three splendid PBS documentaries on the Group, to be seen the next 
three Monday evenings on the "American Masters" series (9 p.m. on Channels 28, 
15 and 50). 
</P>
<P>
If it seemed a little alienating at first to be watching a TV documentary in a 
theater, this soon wore off. Part of the footage on Harold Clurman was, in 
fact, shot at the Taper in 1978, when he was directing a laboratory version of 
Ibsen's "The Lady From the Sea" there. 
</P>
<P>
Clurman is in fine fettle in the film, making it clear that he and Odets and 
the other members of the Group weren't so much reformers as romantics: 
yea-sayers. "Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!" -- the famous curtain 
line of Odets' "Waiting for Lefty" -- was about striking out towards life, not 
just about walking out on the boss. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a lot of negativity too. The Group was one of those families that 
become expert at getting on one another's nerves. Adler was never comfortable 
there: She said it was like spending 10 years with a bunch of strangers. Ruth 
Nelson was ready to kill Strasberg for his hectoring of another actress. Bobby 
Lewis recalls the uproar when Stella Adler came home from Paris to announce 
that Stanislavsky didn't approve of the sense-memory exercises they were doing 
in his name. To which Strasberg replied: "Stanislavsky is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was a rich time. Host and co-producer Joanne Woodward asks Nelson if 
she and the other actors were "at all aware," back then, of what an exceptional 
thing they were attempting -- to be the first permanent American acting 
ensemble, our Moscow Art Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson replies, nicely, that of course they were aware of it. With leadership 
as articulate as Clurman's and Strasberg's, how could they not be? They knew 
they were doing plays that mattered. They could feel themselves growing as 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
So what, then, if most of the Group's show didn't have much of a run? Clurman 
admits that it was a mistake to try to run a permanent theater on a hit-or-flop 
basis. But so what? "Flops," he yells to the camera (his normal mode of 
address), "are the norm in the theater! Life itself is a flop! At the end you 
die! This has occurred even to me! But what an adventure!" 
</P>
<P>
It was, until he died in 1981. The second documentary (July 3), narrated by 
Meryl Streep, reminds us of his subsequent career as a Broadway director. And 
the third one (July 10), narrated by Frank Langella, takes us into the studio 
of Stella Adler, who demands that her acting students stand up and be counted 
when they take the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint about the Group, and its successor, The Actors Studio, was that 
its acting tended to be too colloquial. That was never Adler's style. "It needs 
to be more heroic!" she keeps telling her students in the film. "It needs to be 
more Italian!" 
</P>
<P>
When the lights went up at the Taper, and Adler herself took the stage, red 
hair still blazing, a woman came out to read a proclamation in her honor. She 
stumbled on a word. "Oh, I can't even pronounce it," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you CAN!" Stella roared. There were giants on the earth in those days, 
and some of them are still around.

COWBELL CONCERT?

Bill Kohlhaase's June 19 review of the Playboy Jazz Festival was lacking in its 
coverage. Every artist was mentioned except guitarist Larry Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
I would rather read about Carlton (who gave one of the day's strongest 
performance) than Bill Cosby's interest in playing the cowbell.

THE CONTROVERSY OVER CONTROVERSIAL ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parachini's article gives the National Endowment for the Arts an image of 
chronic spinelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Censorphobia is no excuse for abandoning common sense and good taste in making 
artistic judgments. Whoever could say with a straight face that Andres 
Serrano's image of Christ in urine is art must be a direct descendant of the 
emperor who gave gold to the weaver to make his wonderful invisible clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Some people must be laughing privately at how they are fooling the dilettantes 
who have drifted into positions of authority in the art establishment. 
</P>
<P>
No amount of intimidation justifies any endowment organization's letting itself 
be bamboozled into supporting vulgarity for its own sake.

I am offended by Atkinson's characterization of the music of Mel Powell. 
According to Atkinson, "Powell writes the sort of horribly dissonant music that 
should be confined to bad horror films." In my opinion, a critic who writes 
that sort of horribly ignorant review should himself be confined -- to musical 
matters that will not unduly tax his meager mind and minimalist ears.

<TEXT>
<P>
Why can't the good sense of some of your book reviewers and entertainment 
critics ever show up on your editorial pages? 
</P>
<P>
The latest piece to raise that question is Terry Atkinson's June 19 review of 
KCET-TV's "Take Five" programs. I realize that this kind of 
"the-emperor-is-bare-rumped" commentary will make it difficult for some of The 
Times' senior folk to move in their accustomed high social circles. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, I hope that Terry Atkinson will not be a casualty of his on-point 
reportage. The description of the Museum of Contemporary Art as "an 
aggravating, depressing home for no-point, no-fun modern art" is long overdue.

Serrano's position about his controversial Christ image is reported as being a 
protest against exploitation of religious values. The picture in question is, 
to me, very moving and effective. But, to give it the obnoxious title the 
artist has chosen, "Piss Christ," smacks of blatant exploitation. With a title 
like that, what sort of reaction did he expect?

FACES: HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL

"I think the producers were running a little competition," says vocalist 
Frankie Paul of the hectic period surrounding his emergence as a major reggae 
star in 1983. "I just wanted to get my name out to the public at that time." 
</P>
<P>
Paul, who headlines the "Reggae Summer Shock Out" concert at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Sunday, certainly achieved that. He was such a hot property 
during the mid-'80s that the reggae market was inundated with Frankie Paul 
albums -- 22 of them by his count, and he's just 23. 
</P>
<P>
Blind since birth and prolific in output, Paul has won comparisons to Stevie 
Wonder in reggae circles. (The two performed together when Wonder visited the 
school Paul attended in Jamaica in 1976.) Paul was heavily influenced by the 
hits of American vocalists such as Wonder, as well as the popular Jamaican 
singer Dennis Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born with music," says Paul. "I started young, singing at school 
concerts and parties, on the play field, in the music room, in math class, 
everywhere. I was singing on the streets in Jamaica earning some little dollars 
at a young age." 
</P>
<P>
Paul came to the attention of noted Jamaican session guitarist Earl (Chinna) 
Smith and cut his first single in 1981. His first major hit came after he 
hooked up with producer Junjo Lawes in 1983 and released "Pass the 
Tu-Sheng-Peng" in 1983. Four years later, he hit No. 1 on the British pop chart 
with a reggae version of "Sara," from the film "Fire and Ice." 
</P>
<P>
With that crossover success to his credit and a versatile, expressive voice 
that can evoke the late Marvin Gaye, Paul would seem to be a natural candidate 
for the American pop market. But the perception that reggae artists can attract 
only a limited cult audience apparently still lingers. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the record companies haven't heard the real part of me yet," Paul 
says. "I should have been picked out a long time. I don't know what's holding 
it up, but one of these days. . . ." DON SNOWDEN

'TRAVELING MAN' LOSES ITS WAY, GETS STUCK IN A DITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Traveling Man" (Home Box Office, Sunday at 9 p.m.) aspires to be the "All 
About Eve" of the industrial foam selling business. Ben Cluett (John Lithgow) 
is the veteran selling champ; Billy Fox (Jonathan Silverman) is the young 
hotshot who learns the ropes from Ben and then tries to surpass him. 
</P>
<P>
David Taylor's script sharply sets up the relationship between the two in their 
initial scenes together. But when the movie wanders away from the hard work of 
selling and from its focus on the two of them, it becomes diffuse and 
conventional. 
</P>
<P>
A scene in which Ben looks up an old, disillusioned client injects a gratuitous 
note of melodrama. And two sequences are there for their scenic value more than 
for their relationship to the story. 
</P>
<P>
In one, Ben becomes sexually entangled with a college student (Chynna Phillips) 
who videotapes their lovemaking. Although Ben acts shocked, the scene isn't 
really much more than an old-fashioned traveling-salesman joke. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Ben picks up Joanna (Margaret Colin) in a bar, and they quickly fall in 
love. At first, their affair exists so the film can include colorful shots of 
them strolling through Mardi Gras in New Orleans; then it continues so the 
movie can have a happy ending. The ending's synthetic good vibes also stem from 
an unlikely transformation on the part of young Billy. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin Kershner directed, apparently without much inspiration, judging from the 
way the film slowly fizzles. Lithgow is in fine form as Ben. Silverman makes 
the right moves, but his Southern accent sounds a bit forced. John Glover has a 
couple of enjoyably over-the-top scenes as the company sales manager, exhorting 
Ben and Billy to make that sale. DON SHIRLEY

DAY HIKE: SIGNAL HILL: BEACON FOR UNCONDITIONED HIKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Signal Hill has long been synonymous with oil. Atop this Long Beach prominence, 
a great oil field was discovered in 1921. Alamitos No. 1, as the discovery well 
was known, produced 600 barrels a day. Soon Signal Hill was covered with 
derricks, which produced 250,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
The hill is a quieter place now, though a number of active wells are still 
pumping black gold. Because Signal is the only hill for miles around, it has 
long been a popular conditioning walk for hikers. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club outings leaders report that often more than 100 hikers turn out for 
evening strides around the hill. Signal Hill is anything but a natural 
environment, but the great views of harbor and city and the camaraderie of the 
trail usually add up to a fun trip. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1840s, the hill was the property of rancher John Temple, who called 
his spread Los Cerritos -- "Little Hills." The hill was renamed in 1889 when 
the Coast Survey of 1889 used it as a signal point. 
</P>
<P>
Signal Hill and its geologic cousins to the north -- Baldwin Hills -- were 
uplifted as a result of activity from the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone. One 
result of this fault activity was that oil accumulated beneath various 
anticlines, or domes of rock. 
</P>
<P>
Although Signal Hill achieved worldwide recognition for the petroleum and 
profits it produced, the hill never has been known as a model oil field. 
Haphazard development and excessive drilling led to an ugly and dangerous 
environment. Politics played a part in this. While surrounded by the city of 
Long Beach, two-square-mile Signal Hill managed to incorporate as a separate 
city. Signal Hill's borders approximated the borders of the oil field; its 
cityhood was an attempt to avoid high taxes and environmental restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Signal Hill -- the mountain -- has been cleaned up some since its heyday, and 
its slopes now host more houses than oil wells. Still, day hikers should use 
caution, avoid drilling equipment and respect "No Trespassing" signs. There 
isn't a single path around the hill; rather, you improvise a route on Signal's 
dirt and paved roads. 
</P>
<P>
To fully enjoy the great clear-day views, bring along binoculars and a city 
map. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: From Interstate 405 (San Diego Freeway) in Long 
Beach, take the Cherry Avenue/Signal Hill exit. Head south on Cherry Avenue 
half a mile to Willow Street. Turn left and after a mile, make a right on 
Redondo Avenue, then right on aptly named Hill Street. Proceed to the base of 
Signal Hill. Depending on your time and/or inclination, you can park at the 
base of the hill or closer to the top. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Follow Panorama Drive or the dirt road below it in a counterclockwise 
direction. You'll pass oil wells, get a view to the north of the San Diego 
Freeway, the planes arriving and departing from Long Beach Airport and many 
square miles of suburbia. Eucalyptus and palms trees line the up-and-down dirt 
roads. Lemon grass and California poppies add a little color to the ugly 
hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
Your route crosses Burnett Street and you join a dirt road on the west side of 
the hill. Growing on this slope is a zany mixture of flora -- banana palms and 
California fan palms, Canary Island pines, lemonade berry and brittle bush. 
</P>
<P>
Only the hawks circling overhead have a better view. The view west takes in the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula. Catalina Island, 30 miles away, is visible on a clear 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Looking south and west you can identify the Queen Mary and its three stacks and 
count a number of man-made oil islands. Dominating the coast is the massive Los 
Angeles/Long Beach harbor complex and the tall cranes used for loading 
containerized cargo. Several bridges spanning the harbor also are in view, 
including the Vincent Thomas Bridge, which connects San Pedro and Interstate 
110 (Harbor Freeway) with Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
After circling the hill and seeing the sights, you'll end up at the corner of 
Hill Street and Temple Avenue. Here you'll find the plaque commemorating the 
success of the Southland's oil pioneers and Alamitos No. 1: ". . . a success 
which has, by aiding in the growth and expansion of the petroleum industry, 
contributed so much to the welfare of mankind."

HOLLENBECK CENTER FUND-RAISER SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen years ago, the Hollenbeck Police/Business Council was formed with the 
aims of providing alternatives to youths otherwise destined for gang and/or 
criminal activities; involving adults and youths in physical conditioning and 
keeping seniors active in community events and affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollenbeck Youth Center was created, at 2015 E. 1st St. in Los Angeles, and 
the council now plans an expansion that will more than double the facility. 
Fund-raising events largely finance the center's operation, and next Saturday 
and Sunday, a benefit "Oldies Spectacular Against Crime" has been scheduled at 
the track and field area of Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"Oldies," of course, is a relative term: In concert both days will be Linda 
Ronstadt, backed on Saturday by Dirty Dan (of Sha Na Na), the Crests, the music 
of the Shirelles, Coasters, Drifters, etc. On Sunday, the supporting groups 
will include the Solid Gold '50s Band, the Penguins, Rosie and the Originals, 
the Del Vikings, the Marcels and Richard Yniguez. A grand finale fireworks 
display also is planned. 
</P>
<P>
Hours both days are 5 to 11 p.m. Tickets are $10, on sale at Ticketmaster 
outlets, May Co. and Music Plus stores (no tickets sold at door). For further 
information, call (213) 263-4989.

CARDINAL MANNING DIES; LED ARCHDIOCESE 15 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cardinal Timothy Manning, a mild-mannered Roman Catholic prelate who led the 
Los Angeles archdiocese through a 15-year period that saw it grow into the 
nation's most populous and ethnically diverse, died Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He was 79 and died at the Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Center at the University of 
Southern California, where he had been admitted June 7. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rivera, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said he died at 2:25 p.m. and 
that his successor, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, was at his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
Manning began to undergo radiation therapy early in 1989 upon learning that he 
had lung cancer, which had spread to his spine. Shortly after his condition was 
made known in May, a Mary's Hour crowd of 9,000 at the Hollywood Bowl gave him 
a prolonged standing ovation after Manning led Catholics in the rosary and gave 
the homily. 
</P>
<P>
Although he retired in mid-1985 with the naming of Mahony as his successor, 
Manning had kept active in the church, conducting retreats for fellow bishops 
and preaching at devotional events. 
</P>
<P>
He had been living at Holy Family Parish in South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Friday evening Mahony said Manning will be remembered for "the depth of his 
personal spirituality, the generosity of his love and charity and the 
simplicity of his humble soul (which) were graces which flowed out upon the 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles for some 55 years." 
</P>
<P>
"Only God himself can calculate the immense spiritual mission which his life 
and ministry accomplished among us here in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Manning's direction of the Los Angeles archdiocese from 1970 to 1985 amounted 
to a low-key hiatus between the archconservative reign of Cardinal James 
Francis McIntyre, who clashed in the 1960s with reform-minded Catholics, and 
the energetic management of Mahony, who has been visibly involved in regional 
social problems and in pronouncements of the U.S. Catholic hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elevated in 1973 
</P>
<P>
Manning was named a cardinal in 1973, but the soft-spoken archbishop of Los 
Angeles rarely attempted to parlay that status for influence in public affairs 
or national religious issues -- not even when by 1983 the archdiocese overtook 
Chicago as the diocese with the most Catholics. (Los Angeles stood then at 2.3 
million and now exceeds 3 million.) 
</P>
<P>
For the Irish-born Manning, the three-county Los Angeles archdiocese, which 
includes Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, was "the rim of the Western 
World." It was a place to view through missionary eyes, much as the Franciscans 
did a couple centuries earlier in establishing a string of missions. Thus, much 
of his attention was focused on the church's response to the continuing influx 
of Latino Catholics and other ethnic populations. 
</P>
<P>
Although his passport and church records stated that Timothy Manning was born 
Nov. 15, 1909, in Ballingeary, County Cork, Ireland, he said his actual birth 
date was Oct. 15 that year, as noted on his baptismal certificate. 
</P>
<P>
One of four children of a blacksmith, Manning said he wanted to become a priest 
as long as he could remember, even though no priests were in his family. The 
first priest he ever knew, Manning told one interviewer, was shot to death "for 
happening to be staying in a house of a wanted man" during the fight for Irish 
independence from England. 
</P>
<P>
It was a reminder, he said later, that while the church could rise above 
political issues and preach the values of Christ, it could not afford to lose 
sight of individuals affected by such conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
He began studying for the priesthood in Ireland in 1923, but he was attracted 
to California in 1928 in answer to an appeal for priests by the Diocese of Los 
Angeles-San Diego. In 1934, he finished his training at St. Patrick's Seminary 
in Menlo Park, Calif., and was ordained on June 16, 1934, at St. Vibiana's 
Cathedral in Los Angeles by Archbishop John J. Cantwell. 
</P>
<P>
After a few months as an assistant pastor, Manning was sent to Rome for 
graduate studies in canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University from which 
he was graduated in 1938. Upon his return, he was appointed secretary to 
Cantwell, a post he kept for eight years. He became a U.S. citizen Jan. 14, 
1944. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946, Manning was named an auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles. When McIntyre 
was named the Los Angeles archbishop in 1948, and launched a well-financed 
parish and school building program to match the suburban growth of Los Angeles, 
Manning played administrative roles as chancellor and vicar general. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bishop at Fresno 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican created the Fresno diocese out of the Monterey diocese in 1967, and 
Manning was made its first bishop. In 18 months at Fresno, Manning created a 
diocesan housing commission, authorized a task force to seek funds for 
inner-city minority groups and authorized formation of a priests' senate, an 
advisory board fast becoming the norm in U.S. dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles archdiocese was beset with both the Catholic ferment 
following the innovative Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) and the 
ramifications of civil rights movements. McIntyre, a staunch conservative in 
religion and politics, was in his 80s. That was before the Vatican's mandatory 
retirement age of 75 was instituted. The cardinal won his battle to squelch 
modernization steps by the Immaculate Heart of Mary sisters, but McIntyre was 
openly charged by liberal Catholics with intransigence on church reforms and 
minority rights. 
</P>
<P>
Manning was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Los Angeles in 1969 with the 
right of succession. He returned from Fresno that August. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Succeeds McIntyre 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 21, 1970, Manning succeeded McIntyre and immediately took up residence 
at St. Vibiana's Cathedral, on the edge of downtown's Skid Row -- a move 
symbolic of Manning's pastoral image as servant of the church. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's expressed willingness to listen to unhappy segments in the church and 
systematically visit the parishes had a calming effect and there was little 
open discord in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
"The most pressing problem, the first responsibility I could see, was toward 
the priests of the diocese," he said in an interview 18 months after he 
succeeded McIntyre. "The whole well-being of the community depends on the 
priests, on their unity and on their holiness. My first reaction was to make it 
known that I was here to listen." 
</P>
<P>
Manning permitted the formation of a priests' senate and founded the 
Interparochial Council of East Los Angeles to give a forum for priests, nuns 
and lay people in Mexican-American parishes. He also authorized a new 
Immigration and Citizenship Department of the Catholic Welfare Bureau to help 
eligible aliens to obtain permanent resident status. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles archdiocese was able to "catch up" with the rest of U.S. 
Catholicism in several areas where McIntyre was resistant to change. For 
example, Manning authorized Saturday Masses, a convenient alternative to Sunday 
worship and one already enjoyed by other California Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the ecumenical and interfaith cordiality inspired by Vatican 
II, Manning encouraged relations with other church bodies and made his first 
major address as archbishop at a synagogue -- Wilshire Boulevard Temple. The 
interfaith dialogues and studies initiated under Manning became model programs 
for other American dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was engaging as a public speaker, Manning avoided the limelight and 
rarely made public statements other than to criticize the lack of curbs on 
abortion, which he called murder, and pornography. He surprised some observers 
in the early 1980s, however, with statements that denounced the nuclear arms 
race as a "dance of death" threatening humanity and worsening the plight of the 
poor because of budget priorities for warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bold leader otherwise, Manning disappointed many Catholics by retaining 
the tough, much-feared administrator from the McIntyre era, Msgr. Benjamin 
Hawkes, as treasurer of the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
Manning was among only a handful of U.S. cardinals for a dozen years, but he 
did not carry the kind of clout in American Catholic circles that colleagues in 
New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and Washington did. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his enthusiasm for mission work did not go unnoticed at the Vatican. In 
1978, he was a member of the Vatican-based Sacred Congregation for the 
Evangelization of Peoples. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of his tenure at the Los Angeles chancery, Manning was appointed 
by Pope John Paul II as one of three co-presidents of the 1983 World Synod of 
Bishops meeting in Rome. The following May, the Pope asked Manning to accompany 
him on the papal tour of South Korea, Papua New Guinea and other Far Eastern 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
In a Migrants Day Mass at St. Vibiana's in January, 1985, at which prayers were 
said in 20 different languages, Manning proudly referred to the immigrant 
flavor of many Los Angeles parishes and the Catholic Church's defense of 
undocumented aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Manning recounted a private conversation with the Pope that he had had a few 
months earlier in Vancouver, British Columbia. "I told him that we have 83 
different languages spoken here and also that there are a large number of 
undocumented people here," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a beautiful gesture (the Pope) raised his finger and said, 'Undocumented in 
the state, yes, but not in the Church,' " according to Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Following church requirements, Manning submitted his resignation as the head of 
a diocese in 1984 before his 75th birthday. The Pope did not immediately name a 
successor, however, and Manning did not actually retire from the archbishop's 
post until September, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing to be in good health when he retired, the slightly built Manning was 
a light eater because he had three-fourths of his stomach removed when he was a 
young priest studying in Rome. "Ulcers," he once explained in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
At age 77, he surprised colleagues when he flew by fighter jet for a pastoral 
visit to the aircraft carrier Enterprise, on maneuvers 90 miles off San Diego. 
The next month, Manning accompanied Pope John Paul II during his 1987 visit to 
Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-May this year, the Los Angeles archdiocese announced that Manning was 
under medical care for cancer. Expressing gratitude for the prayers of the Pope 
and Archbishop Mahony, Manning assured well-wishers that he would continue his 
ministry in retirement "according to my abilities." 
</P>
<P>
A Mass will be celebrated by Mahony at 11 a.m. Wednesday at St. Vibiana's and a 
rosary will be recited at 7:30 that night. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 bishops nationwide and in Europe are expected to gather at 11 
a.m. Thursday for a Mass of Christian Burial. Burial will follow at Calvary 
Cemetery in East Los Angeles.

Amid bitter partisan wrangling and the threat of a presidential veto, the 
Senate Friday approved a Democratic-backed child care bill that would provide 
$1.75 billion annually for low-income parents and some $2 billion in tax 
credits for day care programs. 
</P>

The legislation was approved on a voice vote and now moves to the House, which 
is expected to begin consideration of its own child care proposals next week. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill does not provide aid to every child in this country who needs it," 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine said. "But it is a 
significant step forward and a true compromise with both sides. That's what 
we've accomplished here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Candidate for a Veto' 
</P>
<P>
Hours before the final vote, however, Bush Administration spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater declared that the measure is unacceptable to the President and is "a 
candidate for a veto." Although Bush has not ruled out a compromise, he has 
said that there are "major flaws" in the legislation approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republicans also criticized the Democratic measure, saying that the 
fight to pass a child care bill is far from over. Minority Leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas warned that "we're a long way from any child care bill, because this was 
not bipartisan. Anybody who breaks out the champagne should realize that what 
we did today is only a first step." 
</P>
<P>
During seven days of often vitriolic debate, Democrats and Republicans clashed 
over radically different approaches to child care. They also battled for the 
high ground on an issue that both parties believe is a growing national 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the federal government spends an estimated $7 billion each year on 
child care programs. But much of that is in the form of a tax credit claimed 
mostly by middle-income parents and both parties contend that more should be 
done for the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody around here is for child care, the last time I looked," Dole said. 
"We just disagree pretty strongly on how to proceed. I don't know if we can 
find a middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Democrats won a showdown vote with Republicans over rival 
blueprints for a child care bill. They turned back a series of GOP amendments 
Friday that would have gutted the pending legislation and reinstated key 
elements of the Republican proposal. 
</P>
<P>
On a key 53-44 vote, the Senate rejected a motion by Dole to delete a 
Democratic-sponsored tax credit for low-income parents who buy health insurance 
for their children. In its place, Dole had proposed expanding the existing 
Earned Income Tax Credit, saying that would give low-income parents more funds 
to spend on day care. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to win Republican support, Democrats voted to incorporate some elements 
of the original GOP plan into their child care legislation, including a version 
of the earned income tax credit. But Republicans continued to hammer away at 
the Democratic measure, saying that the two sides remained far apart. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Democratic plan, the government would distribute $1.75 billion in 
grants and direct aid annually to low-income parents for day care programs. 
States would be required to establish licensing standards for child care before 
receiving any aid. 
</P>
<P>
The aid would be available for children up to age 13. California would receive 
approximately $168.4 million annually in federal funds under the Democratic 
measure, based on the number of potentially eligible children. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the measure would provide about $2 billion in tax credits for 
low-income families in each of the next five years. These would include 
increases in the existing dependent care and earned income tax credits, as well 
as the new credit for health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Bush and Senate Republicans had offered a combination of tax 
credits and $400 million for unspecified day care programs. They contended that 
the Democratic plan would create a massive bureaucracy for day care, while 
their own proposal maximized "parental choice." More important, they said, the 
GOP tax credits would provide assistance for mothers who choose to stay at home 
and take care of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) said that Congress should not discriminate against 
women who want to work, but cited research showing that children profit greatly 
when parents stay at home to take care of them, especially in their formative 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be encouraging women to stay at home with children" during these 
years, Wilson said, adding that the Democratic measure "does not provide enough 
incentives for the stay-at-home Mom." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats angrily responded that their measure provided ample benefits for 
mothers who do not work. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a key architect of 
the bill, noted that most tax benefits in the Democratic proposal could be 
shared by parents who work or stay at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also rejected a proposal by Wilson that would have permitted some 
states to take federal grant funds for child care and use them instead to 
provide additional tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that this would give states more flexibility but Dodd charged that 
the amendment would "all but destroy" the $1.75-billion day care grant program 
that had been hammered out during months of negotiations.

HIGH COURT LIFTS BAN ON 'DIAL-A-PORN'; 
</P>
<P>
BUT LAWS CAN STILL FORBID MESSAGES THAT ARE FOUND 'OBSCENE' 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court Friday upheld another form of free speech that many find 
distasteful, ruling unanimously that the government may not ban for-pay 
telephone calls simply because they are sexually oriented. 
</P>
<P>
The justices struck down as unconstitutional part of a law passed by Congress 
last year that made it a crime for anyone to sell "indecent" messages over the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to recent technological advances, the court said, parents can ensure 
that their children do not get access to the so-called "dial-a-porn" telephone 
services, which began operating in 1983. As a result, the government is left 
with no compelling reason for banning such calls for adults, the court 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Obscene' Messages 
</P>
<P>
However, on a 6-3 vote, the court also said that the government can ban the 
messages that are so offensive as to be judged "obscene." For more than 30 
years, the Supreme Court has adhered to the view that obscenity is not covered 
by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling allows the once-booming dial-a-porn industry to stay in business but 
it leaves open the threat that a jury may conclude that the messages are so 
"patently offensive," sexually explicit and without redeeming value that they 
must be banned. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the dial-a-porn industry may face an even bigger challenge. As its 
novelty has faded, many of the phone services have been losing callers and 
money, according to a lawyer who represents the major dial-a-porn companies. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a passing fad," New York attorney Norman Beier said Friday. "These 
companies have all suffered a very significant decline in their business. It's 
only about 10% of what it was a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second in a Week 
</P>
<P>
For the high court, Friday's ruling marked the second time this week that a law 
passed by Congress was struck down as a violation of the First Amendment. The 
justices, on a 5-4 vote Wednesday, threw out the 1967 federal law, as well as 
all state laws, that made it a crime to burn an American flag as an act of 
political protest. 
</P>
<P>
The latest ruling also casts doubt on another election year law passed by 
Congress banning all "indecent" broadcasts on television and radio. The Supreme 
Court in 1978 said that the government could protect children by banning such 
broadcasts during the day and in the early evening hours. But it also said that 
such broadcasts -- which may have a sexually explicit scene or foul language in 
the midst of serious drama -- could be shown in later hours when children would 
not be watching. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, spurred by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), Congress enacted a 
24-hour ban on indecent broadcasts, even though members questioned whether such 
a blanket ban was constitutional. That law, now on hold, is being reviewed by 
the U.S. appeals court in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"This ruling should help us. They have said again that indecent speech is 
protected by the First Amendment," said Timothy Dyk, a Washington lawyer 
representing the broadcasters who are challenging the Helms amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The Telephone Decency Act, which also was sponsored by Helms last year, was 
designed to wipe out the dial-a-porn industry, which took off with the 
introduction of "976" services. Simply by dialing this code, callers for a fee 
could gain access to a variety of recordings, including those with sexual 
themes. It was an instant hit with adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
By May, 1983, industry officials said, 800,000 calls per day were being made to 
various "dial-a-porn" services. In California, more than 200 dial-a-porn 
services were in business, some of which offered live conversations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outraged Parents 
</P>
<P>
Outraged parents, facing huge phone bills, complained to the Federal 
Communications Commission, which over five years and through several court 
tests devised rules to ensure that children could not reach the message 
services without permission. By requiring callers to use a credit card or a 
special access code, or by permitting local phone companies to block out 
certain "976" numbers, FCC officials believed that they had found a way to 
solve the dial-a-porn problem. 
</P>
<P>
But the Helms amendment intervened, prompting the Supreme Court test. The law 
made it a crime, punishable by fines of as much as $50,000, to use an 
interstate phone line for "any obscene or indecent communication for commercial 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Last July, as the law was to go into effect, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace 
Tashima in Los Angeles blocked it as partly unconstitutional. Since obscenity 
is not protected by the First Amendment, that part of the ban was upheld, but 
Tashima struck down the ban on "indecent" messages. 
</P>
<P>
The Ronald Reagan Administration appealed to the Supreme Court, but the 
justices Friday affirmed Tashima's ruling in the case (FCC vs. Sable 
Communications, 88-525). 
</P>
<P>
Even though Congress can ban such broadcasts during the day, that does not mean 
it can ban 976 phone calls, the court said. "Placing a telephone call is not 
the same as turning on a radio and being taken by surprise by an indecent 
message," Justice Byron R. White said. He was referring to the 1978 ruling 
against comedian George Carlin, whose "seven dirty words" monologue was 
broadcast over Pacifica radio stations in California. 
</P>
<P>
Both Congress and the Reagan Administration said that the ban on all 
dial-a-porn was needed because "enterprising minors" could find a way to get 
access to it. But White said that there was no evidence to support this 
assertion. 
</P>
<P>
The three most liberal justices -- William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall 
and Harry A. Blackmun -- dissented in part, saying that the government should 
not be permitted to make it a crime for "consenting adults" to buy obscene 
matter. Brennan, who has struggled with the obscenity question for more than 30 
years, said that the court cannot define obscenity with any precision. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruled that employers may provide lesser benefits for older workers without 
violating the federal law banning age discrimination (Public Employees 
Retirement System of Ohio vs. Betts, 88-389). On a 7-2 vote, the court said 
that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act generally exempts pension and 
benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
An employee can win an age discrimination suit against a pension or benefit 
program only by showing that the company or a government agency had "an intent 
to discriminate" against older workers, the court said. It did not say how an 
employee could prove that claim. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling frees from liability an Ohio public employees retirement system that 
forbids employees over age 60 from getting disability benefits. These older 
workers can receive only retirement pay. An appeals court in Cincinnati, ruling 
for a disabled 61-year-old woman, had said that the Ohio plan discriminated 
based on age. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruled that states are immune from being sued for damages by bankrupt 
businesses and persons. On a 5-4 vote, the court said that the Constitution 
blocks such suits against states (Hoffman vs. Connecticut, 88-412).

A Lebanese news magazine said Friday that one of nine Americans held hostage in 
Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists has died in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
There was no independent confirmation of the report in Ash Shiraa, a weekly 
magazine that first broke the story of the Iran-U.S. arms-for-hostages deal in 
1986. Ash Shiraa, however, has published several reports on the hostages that 
proved unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, which did not name its sources, Ash Shiraa said "an American 
hostage died some time ago." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said it had conflicting information on the identity of the 
hostage. Some of the information that it quoted fit the descriptions of Alann 
Steen, Jesse Turner and Robert Polhill, three American professors abducted Jan. 
24, 1987. Other information suggested that the hostage in question might be 
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, the only American serviceman held hostage, 
who was abducted Feb. 17, 1988, in southern Lebanon.

AILING PAPANDREOU ASKED TO FORM NEW GREEK GOVERNMENT

President Christos Sartzetakis called caretaker Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou, who is hospitalized with pneumonia, Friday and offered him a 
mandate to form a government after the conservative party failed to induce a 
Communist-led grouping into joining a coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis, who received the mandate Tuesday, 
said the Coalition of Left and Progress had rejected an offer of more than they 
had asked for, including the Ministries of Justice and the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
The leftists, who now hold the balance of power, said they would refuse to 
enter a coalition with Papandreou's Socialists as long as he remains at the 
helm because of the scandals that plagued Greece during his administration. 
Papandreou, 70, underwent a triple heart bypass operation in London eight 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis, whose New Democracy party won 145 seats in the 300-member 
Parliament -- six seats short of a majority -- in last Sunday's election, was 
first in line to be asked to form a government and sought a coalition with 
Harilaos Florakis, chief of the Communist-led grouping. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK by its Greek acronym, won 
only 125 seats in Parliament and his government resigned Monday. The president 
telephoned Papandreou because he is next in line to try to form a government.

RESULTS OF VOTING FOR CONTINENT'S PARLIAMENT;

<P>
EUROPEANS SHOWED DISSATISFACTION WITH RULING PARTIES

<P>
For several days, political analysts have been sifting through the returns in 
the election for the European Parliament, a five-year term that will encompass 
the Continent's new unified market scheduled to begin in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, they have been asking: What do the widely scattered results for the 
518 seats in the Parliament that sits in Strasbourg, France, add up to? 
</P>
<P>
The answer from the more cynical among them is: Not much, since the European 
Parliament has so far only diluted powers to effect legislation and political 
groupings from right to left that are often confusing and contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
But those more sympathetic to the institution believe the results have more 
significance, that the shift toward the left in the Parliament indicates that 
the European Community as a whole will take more action on social and 
environment issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Measure of Dissatisfaction 
</P>
<P>
Still other experts read the returns and lackluster balloting -- the turnout 
was far below the average in national voting -- as a measure of the 
dissatisfaction with individual governments in power. 
</P>
<P>
In this perspective, Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and West 
Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl were undeniably the major losers, since their 
respective conservative parties suffered severely in the polling. 
</P>
<P>
But suggestions that tough leaders like Thatcher and Kohl can be swept aside by 
their party leaders and replaced with more attractive candidates for their next 
national elections seem premature. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Thatcher brushed aside editorial comment that she should step 
down as leader of the British Conservative Party, declaring that the massive 
European setback was due to a low turnout of Tory voters on a warm, pleasant 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if her campaign, which actually seemed to downgrade Britain's role in the 
European Community, was wrong -- and implicitly -- whether the time had come 
for her to abdicate after 10 years as prime minister, she replied: 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, not at all." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Kohl indicated that he fully intends to remain chancellor through 
the December, 1990, national election, and lead his Christian Democratic Union 
and its coalition allies to its third successive victory. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, held that broad political trends could not be read into an election 
with such a low voter turnout -- by European standards -- of 56%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time for Improvement 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the poor showing in the European Parliament could be a blessing in 
disguise," observed one political analyst here. "Both Kohl and Thatcher, if 
they are smart, can use the next several months to improve their policies and 
image for their next national elections." 
</P>
<P>
While neither Thatcher nor Kohl is particularly popular within their parties, 
they both enjoy successful track records with no obvious successors waiting in 
the wings. 
</P>
<P>
In the European voting, Thatcher lost ground to the left-leaning Labor Party, 
while Kohl saw more seats go to the far-right Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
But political strategists of both conservative parties suggest that the 
European Parliament is like an off-year election, in which voters tend to 
express discontent with the incumbents. But in national elections, according to 
this view, many dissident voters come back to the centrist fold. 
</P>
<P>
If the European elections do not spell immediate doom for the major European 
leaders, they do give some clues, contradictory as they may be, to the mood of 
the electorates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Protest Vote 
</P>
<P>
That mood was reflected in a high protest vote. Voters in only two countries, 
Belgium and Holland, increased the seats held by their governing parties. Spain 
and Luxembourg saw their leading parties come out about even. 
</P>
<P>
But in Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Denmark and 
Portugal, the ruling parties suffered losses in the European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Further, parties with strong environmentalist platforms all did well, though 
the party that did the best, the Greens in Britain with 15% of the vote, 
received no seats because the country is the only one in the European Community 
that operates on a winner-take-all system rather than proportional 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
There was a slight shift to the left in the overall makeup of the Parliament, 
with those groupings gaining a slight majority of about 260 seats. 
</P>
<P>
But the Communists on the extreme left did poorly, mostly in France and Italy, 
losing seven seats. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, West Germany's right-wing Republicans, pushing a populist, 
nationalist, and anti-foreigner platform, polled 7.1%, good for six seats. They 
will join four extreme rightists from Italy, and France's Jean-Marie Le Pen's 
National Front Party, which held onto its 10 seats. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the public of the Community's 12 member-nations have been unexcited 
by the Parliament because they regarded it largely as a talking shop, whose 
members serve only in a consultative role and lack the power to legislate. 
</P>
<P>
It was the European Commission, the community's executive body, and the Council 
of Ministers, appointive national representatives, that laid down the law in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, however, members were directly elected to the Parliament for the first 
time, with the authority to approve or disapprove the items in the European 
Community budget. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Single European Act greatly increased the Parliament's 
responsibility for the environment, health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Parliament has a key new power, the ability to reject or amend laws, 
that with 260 votes and the backing of the European Commission, can only be 
overruled by a unanimous vote of the Council of Ministers. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent example, the Parliament wished to tighten auto emission controls 
and forced the Council of Ministers, which opposed the controls but not 
unanimously, to accept them. 
</P>
<P>
The incoming Parliament is expected to push for additional powers, particularly 
those involving legislation for the Single Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The next interesting vote, Brussels officials say, will be next month's 
election of a parliamentary president (Speaker) to succeed British Conservative 
Lord Plumb. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates mentioned most prominently are the French conservative and 
former president, Valery Giscard d'Estaing; former Belgian Foreign Minister Leo 
Tindemans, a moderate conservative, and Spanish Socialists Enrique Baron and 
Fernando Moran-Lopez. The betting is on a Socialist.

TURMOIL IN CHINA: CRACKDOWN ON DISSENT; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH ASKS LAWMAKERS FOR 'PATIENCE' ON CHINA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush appealed Friday to members of Congress for "patience and 
forbearance" with his cautious approach in dealing with China's crackdown on 
dissent, according to legislators who met with him. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, said the President made the appeal at a White House meeting with 
leading lawmakers that focused primarily on the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"With regard to China, the president asked for our patience and forbearance," 
Biden said. "He believed that it was appalling what was happening in China in 
terms of human rights," but added "there was a long road that was going to have 
to be traveled in that relationship and we shouldn't move precipitously," Biden 
quoted Bush as saying. 
</P>
<P>
To protest the wave of arrests and executions that has taken place since June 
3-4, when Chinese troops mounted a bloody assault on pro-democracy 
demonstrators in Beijing, Bush has suspended military sales to China, begun 
efforts to stop $1.4 billion in international development loans and banned 
high-level U.S. contacts with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell of Maine, who was at the meeting, and 
other lawmakers have criticized Bush for not taking stronger action to protest 
the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it -- I think the president was saying that it is very simple to 
take a precipitous action, break relations with China, but the long-range 
interests of the United States require delicate, appropriate, judgmental 
handling of the situation," said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who also 
attended the session. 
</P>
<P>
There were these other protests Friday against the executions and political 
crackdown in Beijing: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Belgium announced it has frozen state loans to China and stopped funding 
for new development projects. 
</P>
<P>
It has also suspended high-level visits between the two countries, a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze affects an agreed-upon $7.5-million loan and any new loans until 
further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Italian government said it had suspended future development aid to 
China because of Beijing's "unacceptable repression." Foreign Minister Giulio 
Andreotti said, "We have no choice but to suspend consideration (of future 
programs) as a sign of our grave dissent from current executions and 
unacceptable repression." Since 1987, Rome has said it would provide China with 
aid and loans totaling $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Japan Socialist Party Secretary General Tsuruo Yamaguchi, said Japan's 
major opposition party had decided to suspend top-level exchanges with the 
Chinese Communist Party for the time being. Yamaguchi said his party also 
demanded that the Japanese government take strong action against China. He said 
his planned visit to China later this year will be reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Bonn, the West German parliament called on the United Nations to debate 
violations of human rights in China without delay. A resolution backed by all 
five parties represented in parliament condemned the executions and demanded 
that the Security Council, the General Assembly and the human rights commission 
of the United Nations "immediately deal with the aggravated human rights 
violations in China." 
</P>
<P>
It also called on China to declare an amnesty for dissidents, stop all 
political trials and allow independent human rights groups to visit jailed 
pro-democracy demonstrators. And it urged the World Bank to cancel further 
credits to the Beijing government. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official noted that the West German government had suspended 
all development aid and economic cooperation with China but ruled out a 
full-blown West German economic boycott.

The United States and Japan reached an agreement to start monitoring Japanese 
fishing of the North Pacific with huge, 30-mile-long "drift nets" that haul up 
Alaskan salmon, marine mammals and sea birds in addition to their intended 
catch, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the Commerce and State departments and the Japan Fishing 
Agency calls for the use of transmitters on Japanese government vessels in the 
North Pacific in 1989 to monitor their location, and their placement on more 
vessels in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The pact also calls for putting several Japanese and nine American observers on 
Japanese vessels to determine their location and type of catch. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was prompted by U.S. concern about what environmentalists have 
called the "strip mining" of the North Pacific by an estimated 1,500 vessels -- 
primarily from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan -- using drift, or gill, nets.

Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi left for home Friday to implement a 
cease-fire that will end 14 years of civil war with Angola's Marxist 
government. Shooting was to stop at midnight Friday (4 p.m. PDT). 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the U.S.-backed rebels and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos signed the truce and sealed it with a handshake late Thursday at a 
special African summit here to promote peace in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
Savimbi leads the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), 
which has been backed by China, South Africa and Washington in its fight to 
share power with Dos Santos' Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola. 
</P>
<P>
Difficult negotiations still face the rival Angolan parties in drafting a 
permanent peace agreement.

Solidarity's 161 deputies and 99 senators in Poland's new Parliament refused 
Friday to propose a candidate for president or take jobs in the Communist 
government and pledged to remain a political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The senators and deputies led by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa also said they 
will vote "in line with the will of the voters" when a government candidate for 
president is proposed, almost certainly Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is little doubt that Jaruzelski will remain as leader, the party 
itself is torn by debate over its future after its stunning election defeat by 
Solidarity, according to the party's chief ideologist Marian Orzechowski. 
</P>
<P>
Orzechowski said the party should take a majority decision on how far it should 
change after the defeat, including proposals to replace it with a totally new 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said at a news conference that 
Solidarity senators and deputies will also remain a political opposition to the 
Communist government and will not take ministerial jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Following Solidarity's landslide victory in parliamentary elections June 4 and 
June 18 Poles expected Walesa or at least another Solidarity candidate to run 
for president as a rival of Jaruzelski, whose popularity has been dwindling 
although he pushed for Poland's sweeping political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa defended Jaruzelski, saying he has become a scapegoat for the people and 
is paying for the inefficient rule of his party during the past 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether he deserves it or not, Jaruzelski is paying for it," Walesa said. All 
criticism has focused on him." Jaruzelski declared martial law in 1981 to halt 
a growing wave of unrest and Solidarity was banned in 1982. The trade union was 
re-legalized this year under a government-opposition agreement on economic and 
political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressured to Run 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said he had been pressured to run for president but refused because the 
Solidarity-led opposition in Parliament will still be smaller than the 
Communist-led coalition under a formula that paved the way for Poland's freest 
election in more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The new Labor Party, with headquarters in Gdansk, called on the Communist 
Party, the allied Democratic and Peasants and the political opposition not to 
support Jaruzelski and proposed Walesa for the job of president. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity has 260 representatives in the new Parliament -- 99 senators in the 
100-person upper house and 161 deputies or 35% of the seats -- the maximum it 
could gain under the agreement with the government -- in the 460-member of the 
Sejm or the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Communist-led government coalition has 299 seats in the 
Sejm and one senator. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said the job of president could not be won with such an alignment of 
forces in the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared to achieve bigger things with 35% of seats in the Sejm," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his references to the party split, Orzechowski appeared to call for a vote 
on the dispute between reformers and conservatives by the Central Committee, 
the party's top policy-making body, when it meets Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The session "must and will end with concrete, clear, ideological and political 
decisions," Orzechowski told the party daily Trybuna Ludu. 
</P>
<P>
He said opinions were split between reformers favoring more democracy and 
conservatives who looked to the past and blamed the leadership for political 
incompetence or even betraying socialism.

CITY TAKES DEBT MEDICINE: LOSES ITS POWER TO GOVERN

ECORSE, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The public library, once the pride of this gritty, blue-collar city, is locked 
up tight. Behind bolted doors and plywood-covered windows, dusty rows of 
imprisoned books, thousands of them, go unread. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttered library, just a few blocks from the Ecorse City Hall, stands as a 
symbol of both the city's past and its present. 
</P>
<P>
It first gained notoriety as a safe harbor for Prohibition smugglers bringing 
booze across the Detroit River from Canada. Today Ecorse has a new distinction. 
The 2.2-square-mile city just south of Detroit is home to one of the most 
severe remedies ever forced upon an American city to save it from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
"Draconian," is how Standard &amp; Poor's municipal finance expert, Hyman C. 
Grossman, described the extraordinary measure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Base Undermined 
</P>
<P>
Ecorse found itself in trouble because of the Midwest's changing economy. 
Suppliers for auto factories closed up shop or moved away, its one steel mill 
teetered on the brink of closing, its housing stock aged along with its 
population, all helping to undermine the city's tax base while a long series of 
inept politicians, many of them accused or convicted of corruption, occupied 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Burdened by $6 million in debts, beset by lawsuits seeking to collect unpaid 
utility bills, and paralyzed by bickering officials unable to agree on a 
budget, Ecorse, with a population of about 12,000, was stripped of its local 
government by a Michigan judge in December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Authority and responsibility normally held by elected officials were handed to 
Louis H. Schimmel, a municipal finance expert who lives in a different county 
and never visited Ecorse before being named receiver. The chief judge of the 
Wayne County Circuit Court gave Schimmel total power to operate the city 
unhindered by politics, voters or history. 
</P>
<P>
In 30 months, he has sharply lowered the cost of running Ecorse and almost 
wiped out the debt by almost wiping out government. He has cut the municipal 
work force of 140 almost in half and, more important, hired private companies 
to provide normal city services. And what he could not privatize was closed, 
sold or scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
He even tried to cut out salaries for the mayor and the six city councilmen 
before learning such a step was prohibited by state law. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something wrong . . . when you have one guy come in who's almost like 
a dictator and take home rule away from people," said Schimmel, who is also 
executive director of the Municipal Advisory Council of Michigan, a municipal 
bond evaluating service. "You can justify it . . . . when somebody is 
flagrantly abusing the system, which is what was going on here." 
</P>
<P>
"The receiver is the absolute chief executive officer," said Mayor Larry B. 
Salisbury, who was elected after Schimmel was appointed. "The council, by court 
order, yielded all the power vested in them. The receiver doesn't have to 
discuss what he's going to do with anybody. But he's a polite enough person 
that he does." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large, Small Cures 
</P>
<P>
Polite, but tough. In the last 30 months, Schimmel has turned a chronically 
cash-short city into one that is living on much less than it is collecting. 
He's done this in ways large and small, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Firing 40 political appointees who, Schimmel said, "weren't doing anything" 
and either eliminating or consolidating their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abolishing the department of public works, forcing 27 workers to retire 
early and selling the public works garage and all the heavy equipment. A 
private contractor was hired for snow removal, tree trimming, debris removal, 
weed cutting, street sweeping, water and sewer system maintenance and street, 
alley, and sidewalk repairs -- saving Ecorse $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Renegotiating contracts, including the rubbish collection pact, with a 
private company. Garbage pickup now costs the city $120,000 a year less. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Installing new water meters throughout the city increasing revenues by 
$500,000 a year for a one-time $370,000 investment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phasing out full-time firemen and replacing them with volunteer and 
part-time paid firemen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Closing a variety of public facilities, from the ice rink (built when there 
were 6,000 children in Ecorse schools compared to an enrollment of about 1,600 
now) to the library, which costs $40,000 each year to operate, a minute portion 
of the city's annual $6.5-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
"The library costs too much for a city that has such a small tax base. There 
are loads of other libraries nearby Ecorse," said Schimmel. "And they built the 
ice rink when they had lots of kids and it wasn't a senior citizen community. 
There's nobody who wants to ice skate now." 
</P>
<P>
Ecorse was once one of the richest communities in the industrial strip south of 
Detroit. "In the 1950s we had more money to spend per capita than almost any 
other city this size in America," said Mayor Salisbury. 
</P>
<P>
A major steel mill, salt mines and a shipyard where giant Great Lakes iron ore 
carriers were built all contributed to the city's prosperity. The legendary 
Edmund Fitzgerald was the last ship launched in Ecorse and like the library, 
the freighter, which sank in Lake Superior in 1975 with all 29 crew members, is 
a symbol of what Ecorse was and is today. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of its industry -- and its tax base -- is gone now except for the 
steel mill, which has been upgraded but employs thousands fewer workers than it 
did in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The city's population has slipped from 20,000 to 12,000. More than half of them 
are senior citizens living on fixed incomes in tract houses built after World 
War II for returning GI's and factory workers. The town is divided evenly 
between blacks and ethnic whites and divided by a wide band of railroad tracks 
with blacks living largely to the west and whites to the east. 
</P>
<P>
Ecorse is nestled in a strip of other equally small cities, some of which are 
also beginning to experience financial problems for some of the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has saved the city and believes that when he leaves later this year 
it will be only $1 million in the red and able to be out of debt within a year, 
Schimmel says in the end the city may fail anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I did it once," he said. "I think I've blazed a trail for others to 
follow." But, he added, "I don't think when a municipality gets in the kind of 
shape that Ecorse was in, to send someone like me in to bail it out does any 
good because now, when I leave, it is just going to fall apart again." 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody in Ecorse is pleased with Schimmel's work. In fact, half the 
elected city council opposes his cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
"Look man, I can't go along with nothing he's trying to do," said James W. 
Parker Sr., a veteran Ecorse city councilman. "The man came into this town to 
destroy Ecorse, and he's doing a damn good job." 
</P>
<P>
Schimmel said the city ought to be merged into another neighboring city. 
"Ecorse ought to disappear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan officials agree. They are working on legislation providing a formal 
mechanism for dissolving cities in the kind of fiscal trouble Ecorse was in at 
the end of 1986, in effect forcing them to merge with neighboring communities.

The House on Friday sent to President Bush a $3.5-billion emergency spending 
bill for veterans, education, refugee assistance and other programs requiring a 
cash infusion this year. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 1989 supplemental appropriations bill, approved by the Senate on 
Thursday night, was passed by the House, 318 to 6, two days after the chamber 
rejected a version that would have sparked a veto fight with the President. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was expected to sign the revised bill, which was stripped of $821 million 
that House Democrats had earmarked for anti-drug programs. The White House 
contends that federal agencies already have all the money they can spend this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The new version adds $75 million in anti-drug funds by deferring spending on 
two other programs.

B-2 COSTS TO ESCALATE, AF FIGURES SHOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The B-2 stealth bombers will cost more than $530 million each, according to 
cost figures declassified Friday by the Air Force, but Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), 
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, quickly predicted that the 
aircraft and its production costs "won't fly" in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The service plans to build 132 of the radar-evading planes at a total cost of 
$70 billion, an increase from an earlier estimate of $67.7 billion. The Air 
Force has already spent $17.3 billion on the B-2 and has requested $39 billion 
for the program over the next five years, including about $8 billion a year in 
the early 1990s when production will be at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
According to Air Force year-by-year figures, while the Bush Administration had 
planned to slow costs for the B-2 over the next three years, it would sharply 
increase B-2 spending from $5.3 billion in 1991 and $7.8 billion in 1992 to 
$8.4 billion in 1993, or roughly the same amount in 1993 as planned by the 
Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not spend $7 billion to $8 billion a year for B-2 in its three peak 
funding years," Aspin said.

Federal regulators suspended low-power tests at the Seabrook nuclear power 
plant Friday, citing concerns about a reactor shutdown prompted by a 
malfunctioning valve, a plant spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it wants a "thorough review of the 
reactor shutdown" before low-power tests resume, spokesman Ron Sher said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission believes operators waited "several minutes" too long before 
shutting down the reactor Thursday, plant executive Edward Brown said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not strictly adhere to our test procedures" in response to temperature 
and pressure changes in various systems, Brown said. He said plant officials 
would cooperate fully with the NRC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
NRC spokesmen in Washington and a regional office in Pennsylvania said the 
agency had done nothing with respect to Seabrook. But Sher said the apparent 
discrepancy may be semantics and that plant officials were told by telephone 
that testing could not resume until a commission inquiry was complete.

DEMOCRATIC CHIEF BACKS EARLIER CALIF. PRIMARY

Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown on Friday endorsed the campaign to move 
up the date of the 1992 California presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good idea. I look on it favorably," Brown said at a breakfast meeting 
with Southern California reporters. 
</P>
<P>
California votes at the tail end of the primary election season, and not since 
1972 has it played a truly pivotal role in the outcome of a contested primary. 
In 1988, the state and its concerns had become all but irrelevant in the 
primary campaigns. The nominees were already determined by the time 
Californians went to the polls, and there was hardly any debate over matters of 
particular interest to the state -- everything from immigration to federal 
water projects. 
</P>
<P>
Local leaders of both parties came away from that perfunctory June primary vote 
expressing alarm about just how unfamiliar George Bush and Michael Dukakis were 
with the geography and political cross-currents of California. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, who previously opposed any rescheduling of 
the primary, suddenly changed course after the 1988 primary and said the state 
needed to strengthen its hand. 
</P>
<P>
Now pending in the state Assembly Ways and Means Committee is bipartisan 
legislation to position California in the thick of things next election by 
advancing the date of the primary from the first Tuesday in June to the first 
Tuesday in March. That would put the state just after the Iowa caucuses and the 
New Hampshire primary, and before the consolidated Super Tuesday election of 
Southern states, providing everyone else keeps to the 1988 timetable. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes some of the emphasis off the early primary states," Brown said about 
moving California ahead in the queue. "These candidates who have been spending 
130 days in Iowa, for example, will have to spend a lot of their time in 
California. And some can argue that since California is much more important in 
electing a President, you ought to pay more attention to California early." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) is the author of the pending legislation to 
move up the primary. He said it was a matter of increasing California's voice 
on issues ranging from transportation to air pollution to immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Costa said he could count on overpowering leadership support to move the 
proposal through the Assembly. But in the Senate, President Pro Tem David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) continues to express reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti is concerned about how a March primary would affect Legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks it would add to the cost of campaigns, since there would be a longer 
period before the general election. And he is worried that voters already 
turned off will be further turned off by a still longer campaign," spokesman 
Robert Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
Forsythe added, however, "He is not at this point committed to stopping this on 
his own." 
</P>
<P>
Costa indicated that he might be willing to compromise and split the 
difference, moving the primary from June to the second Tuesday in April in 
consolidation with municipal elections in some communities. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was in California for a Democratic Party finance meeting and to venture 
into the lion's den by opening a party office in heavily Republican Orange 
County.

NEVADA EXECUTES DOUBLE MURDERER

Double murderer Sean P. Flanagan was put to death at the Nevada State Prison on 
Friday, and his final words were those of love for his prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
As five guards strapped Flanagan, 28, to a gurney in the death chamber at the 
prison, the condemned man smiled and told prosecutor Dan Seaton, "I love you." 
</P>
<P>
"He has said it before," Seaton said. "He means it in terms of Christian love 
and forgiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan was executed for two 1987 killings in Las Vegas after Gov. Robert 
Miller rejected a last-minute petition for a stay from the American Civil 
Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
In a seven-page statement, Flanagan had revealed that he hated his 
homosexuality. He said it was difficult for him to determine what made him kill 
men he thought were homosexual, but "the thought that I would be doing some 
good for our society crossed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan confessed to the two murders after he was arrested in Orange, Calif., 
for jaywalking. He said he strangled and dismembered 45-year-old chef James 
Lewandowski, who had befriended him after he lost all his money drinking and 
gambling. Four days later, he said, he strangled pianist Albert Duggins, 59, 
after Duggins offered him a ride. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, who spent his last hours reading the Bible, was declared dead eight 
minutes after the lethal injection began at 2:01 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he believes he is a Christian, but from God's perception, no," said 
Seaton, the deputy Clark County district attorney. "I'm sure he'd kill again." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second execution in five days in Nevada, and the state's fourth and 
the nation's 114th since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to 
resume use of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Miller, in saying he would not intervene to halt the execution, said that 
Flanagan had appeals available if he wanted to use them. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan told the Associated Press in an interview Wednesday that he would not 
pursue appeals because he had to pay his debt to society. But he maintained, 
"After giving my life to Jesus, I couldn't hurt anybody again." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan apologized to the families of his victims and said, "I hope they'll 
understand my execution is proper and just."

MENTAL PATIENTS ALLOWED TO REFUSE DRUGS 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court has abruptly reinstated an appellate ruling that gives 
California's more than 150,000 involuntarily held mental patients the right to 
refuse antipsychotic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The court's surprise action came more than a year after the justices had agreed 
to review the decision and had received briefs from a wide range of medical 
authorities, government officials and patients' rights groups concerned about 
the far-reaching implications of the case. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without hearing argument or issuing an opinion, issued a brief 
order Thursday dismissing the case and reinstating the 1987 decision by a state 
Court of Appeal, which becomes binding on trial courts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Can Require Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Under the appellate court ruling, patients committed involuntarily by county 
medical officials for three-day or 14-day periods under state statutes may 
refuse to take mood-altering drugs unless a judge rules that they are 
incompetent or that there is a threat of death or serious bodily harm to the 
patient or others. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for hospitals challenging the ruling said Friday that the decision will 
greatly impede effective treatment of the mentally ill, force more use of 
physical restraints on patients and impose near-impossible burdens on medical 
authorities and judges to resolve disputes over medication under limited time 
constraints. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not realistic to expect a judge to pass on these cases within 72 
hours," said Ezra Hendon, an attorney for St. Mary's Hospital and Medical 
Center in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"The net effect of this ruling is that there will be more people out on the 
streets pushing shopping carts and sleeping on grates," he said. "This decision 
may satisfy someone's notion of an abstract principle, but the patients who 
supposedly would benefit are going to be denied effective treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Ross E. Campbell of Burlingame, a lawyer for the California Assn. of Hospitals 
and Health Systems and the Hospital Council of Southern California, called the 
court's action "very unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
"These medications are one of the primary modes of initial treatment," Campbell 
said. "Involuntarily detained patients are often very difficult to manage and 
very, very sick. . . . There is no way to treat them until they receive drugs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Positive Impact' 
</P>
<P>
But Morton P. Cohen, an attorney representing the patient who successfully 
challenged forced medications, said the ruling will have a "positive impact." 
</P>
<P>
"What this case essentially does is give the mentally ill the same rights as 
the mentally healthy," said Cohen, a professor at Golden Gate University Law 
School in San Francisco. "Too often, these drugs are used as a substitute for 
adequate staffing in hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen noted that drugs can still be administered in legitimate emergencies and 
predicted that most patients eventually will agree to take medications when 
they are able to negotiate with hospital authorities. "And when people can work 
things out with the hospital, they will be more likely to stay on with the 
treatment when they go back on the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose in a class-action lawsuit filed in 1985 against St. Mary's 
Hospital by lawyers for Eleanor Riese, a 45-year old San Francisco woman 
described in court documents as a chronic schizophrenic. Riese had been taking 
the drug Thorazine but then refused further medication. After the woman engaged 
in violent and bizarre acts, she was committed involuntarily and hospital 
authorities forcibly injected the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, citing potential adverse side effects from antipsychotic drugs, 
argued that involuntarily committed patients should have the same right to 
refuse medication as patients who commit themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Overturned 
</P>
<P>
A San Francisco Superior Court judge rejected the suit, but in December, 1987, 
a state Court of Appeal overturned that decision and upheld Riese's 
contentions. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's subsequent appeal to the state Supreme Court drew support from 
the state Department of Mental Health, the California Psychiatric Assn. and a 
long list of county authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Los Angeles County noted that in 1988 more than 26,000 people were 
committed involuntarily for 72-hour periods in the county. Taking disputes over 
medication to the courts could place a huge burden on the local judiciary, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Administering drugs opens the way for further therapy, the county said, and if 
such treatment cannot be provided, mental health facilities "will be nothing 
more than penitentiaries, and patients will become the losers."

'SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS LOST A . . . FRIEND'

Southern California religious and political leaders Friday remembered Cardinal 
Timothy Manning as a man of quiet, persuasive spirituality who influenced those 
he met with warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Alfred Wolf, director of the Skirball Institute of American Values and 
rabbi emeritus of Wilshire Boulevard Temple, said: 
</P>
<P>
"I mourn Cardinal Manning's death as a personal loss. The cardinal was a man of 
great learning and of deep faith. His love of people transcended denominational 
divisions. He encouraged the open dialogue between faith groups -- especially 
between Catholics and Jews -- which has become the hallmark of Los Angeles 
religious life. All of Southern California has lost a good friend." 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the most impressive people I've ever met," said James N. Loughran, 
president of Loyola Marymount University. "Without being dynamic or 
charismatic, he was just so impressive for his intelligence, his wisdom, his 
deep understanding of the Gospel." 
</P>
<P>
Loughran recalled the time Manning used a typically low-key approach in dealing 
with complaints that had come to him about rock 'n' roll lyrics being played by 
students on the campus radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"Next time we were together, he said, 'What's going on the radio station?' He 
understood what it is to run a college, and you're going to have those things, 
and you're going to deal with them one way or another. He wasn't particularly 
bothered by that." 
</P>
<P>
Manning communicated the same warmth to secular society. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a strong force for good government," county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he had conferred with Manning on secular matters during his years as 
a supervisor and Los Angeles city councilman but also came to know him as a 
personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He visited me in the hospital when I was sick," Hahn said. "He introduced me 
to Pope John Paul as a friend: 'Here's my friend Kenneth.' That said it all. 
I'm so sorry to hear about his passing." 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan eulogized Manning as a man who "enriched the 
lives of thousands who are better because of his good work." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley ordered flags at city buildings flown at half-staff in honor 
of Manning. 
</P>
<P>
"Cardinal Manning eased the turmoil and transition from pre- to post-Vatican 
Council times for Catholics in the Los Angeles area," Bradley said. "He helped 
them through a most difficult period, and for that he will be remembered."

SCHOOLCHILDREN GREET PILOT, 11, IN LENINGRAD

Tony Aliengena, 11, landed in Leningrad on Friday in his around-the-world 
flight to the greetings of schoolchildren who crowded around to give him 
flowers and welcome him to the "land of the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
"The flight was short and easy, and it's great to be here," the boy from San 
Juan Capistrano said as he stepped out of his Cessna 210 Centurion after the 
hour and 40 minute flight from Helsinki, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Barabash, also 11, gave Tony a loaf of brown bread and a cup of salt -- 
the traditional Russian welcome -- and then recited a poem in Russian that she 
had written. 
</P>
<P>
"I want peace all over the world," her poem said in part. "If we die in war, 
the grown-ups will have to answer for it." 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad is the 13th stop on Tony's 17,500-mile trip, which has been dubbed 
the "friendship flight" because of the boy's plan to meet with Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev next week to present him with a "friendship scroll" of the 
signatures of youngsters he has met during the trip.

NONPROFIT RADIO STATIONS RETRENCH AND ACTIVATE CAMPAIGNS FOR SURVIVAL

This weekend finds public-radio station KLON-FM waging its first emergency 
campaign for money, while fellow public-radio station KUSC-FM struggles with a 
major cutback in personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're both sort of retrenching and building back again," said KLON 
general manager Rick Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
KLON (88.1) is making its current pitch for $75,000 -- in addition to its 
regular fall and spring drives -- because of "a shortfall in just about every 
area of revenue," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a very tough year," Lewis said. "We have been cutting back on 
expenses but it's still falling short, so we're trying to make that up." 
</P>
<P>
Funding from Cal State Long Beach declined by more than $137,000 from last 
year, and money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting dropped by about 
$8,000 from 1988 to 1989. Also, corporate support dropped by about $3,000 from 
last year, according to Cindy Young, KLON's director of marketing and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
So on-air personnel can be heard making their pitch, if a bit apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tone we haven't used before," Lewis said. "We try to stay upbeat and 
try to avoid pleading as well . . . but we do want to be candid about the 
situation. We have nothing to gain by fooling ourselves or anybody else that 
there is a serious problem there and we have to deal with it. We would hate to 
have it all fall apart and have people ask later, 'Why didn't you tell us how 
serious it all was?' " 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KUSC-FM (91.5) in Los Angeles plans to cut back its staff of 36 
full-time employees by seven positions at the end of the month while adding two 
vice presidents (and promoting a third) to oversee the operation. The staff 
cuts include the director of production and programming, a program host and 
employees in finance and administration, programming and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, six other people have left the station in the past several months 
and their jobs have not been filled, although management said it will replace 
two of the positions. So the staff that numbered 42 full-time employees a few 
months ago will soon be down to 33. 
</P>
<P>
But the changes are not the result of financial shortfalls, said Wally Smith, 
general manager of the USC-owned station. He said the move was prompted in part 
by a directive that USC issued to all departments to look for ways to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a change in business strategy more than anything else," Smith said. "It 
affects personnel but it's really looking at ways in which we can reduce 
overhead." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about a report that the mood among KUSC employees was gloomy because of 
the cutbacks, Smith said, "Gloom is an exaggeration. There is sadness; they 
worked very closely together. I would say that it's a period of change and 
people are always concerned during a period of change. But I think there are as 
many people here who are excited about the future of the radio station as there 
are people who are depressed about the radio station. I don't think there will 
be a morale problem when we get through this." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Taylor, KUSC's director of public relations, explained that the station 
has met its revenue projections, but that the cutbacks are a way to attack the 
problem of increasing expenditures before they reach crisis proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that nonprofit radio stations tend not to be as business-minded as 
for-profit stations and he hopes to streamline operations at KUSC to make it a 
better business. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary thing we're doing is adjusting the whole organization and 
operation of KUSC to make the next major thrust forward in the development of 
the organization," Smith said. "We're in the process of reorganizing and 
recruiting talent in this new effort. I think we have an obligation to the 
sponsors and individual contributors to think as cleanly and clearly as we can 
about how we spend our money." 
</P>
<P>
He said the station is trying to reduce overhead by phasing out the in-house 
production unit and replacing full-time producers and announcers with 
free-lancers. 
</P>
<P>
Although public radio stations such as KRCW-FM (89.9), KPCC-FM (89.3) and 
KCSN-FM (88.5) are not encountering problems like those at KUSC and KLON, 
station managers there are only cautiously optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're experiencing a period of fairly significant growth, especially on the 
East side and in the San Fernando Valley," said KPCC general manager Rod 
Foster. But he was quick to point out that "L.A. is a very difficult market for 
public radio and it's a difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
Stations are competing for a limited amount of federal dollars, he said, and 
although each station's programming is quite different from the others, there 
are some areas of overlap, which lead to heightened competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Hirschman, general manager of KCRW, explained that scrambling just to keep 
up with last year's standard of programming is the norm in public radio. The 
programming that $2 million buys this year will require $2.25 million next 
year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget grows at a horrendous rate; that's the problem for all of us," 
Hirschman said.

ACTRESS'S NARROW ESCAPE NOT PART OF THE SCRIPT

Xi'an, China 
</P>
<P>
Monday, June 5 
</P>
<P>
I spoke to the directors today and told them I would not work for a government 
who would murder their own people. 
</P>
<P>
 -- from the diary of actress 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Gates 
</P>
<P>
Film actress Debbie Gates went to China two months ago to portray an American 
journalist who was forced to escape from the city of Xi'an in 1937. But before 
the cameras finished rolling on her movie, Gates found herself planning her own 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' getaway may not have been as dramatic, or as dangerous, as that of Helen 
Snow, the journalist who escaped from the Chiang Kai-shek government's Xi'an 
prison in 1937. But Gates nonetheless spent two terrifying weeks trying to get 
home from Xi'an, about 800 miles southwest of Beijing -- including several days 
stranded in China after she quit the film to protest the June 4 massacre of 
pro-democracy demonstrators at Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death," said the brown-haired actress, back in her North 
Hollywood home but still keyed-up and breathless from her brush 
</P>
<P>
with danger. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said that she virtually became a prisoner in her hotel room in Xi'an, 
when her Chinese producers refused to let her leave or help her get out of the 
country. She says other members of the film crew were barred from speaking with 
her. Her mail was opened, she said, and her phone monitored and her travel 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
Gates was in Xi'an to star in "The Adventures of an American Woman: Helen 
Snow," a feature film produced by the Chinese government's August First Film 
Studio as part of the 40th anniversary of the Communist Party's rise to power. 
Snow and her husband, Edgar Snow ("Red Star Over China"), helped chronicle the 
Chinese Civil War and the rise of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Helen Snow was not a Communist," the actress explained. "But the Chinese 
people seem to admire her and Edgar. They think of them as gods because they're 
the people who gave the world information about the Communist Party. That's why 
they wanted to make a movie about them." 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who has appeared in TV episodes of "V" and "The Judge," auditioned in 
Hollywood for representatives of the Chinese film company. She got the part on 
March 31 and was on her way to China a day later. 
</P>
<P>
Until June 4, Gates said everything went well. The film was nearly completed 
when she and co-star John Perry heard about the government's decision to order 
its troops to open fire on the protesters in and around Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
"We had heard about the massacre and immediately quit," Gates recalled. "One of 
the things that upset me was listening to the student in Beijing on the phone 
tearfully telling me how they just shot a 7-year-old boy, how they were 
indiscriminately shooting people and hearing the gunfire in the background. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very angry that anybody would shoot children, and the people were so 
peaceful. They were just sitting there." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said that she didn't know that her employers were part of the Chinese 
government until just before the assault on the protesters. When she did learn, 
she said she got angry and immediately told the head of the studio that she 
would not work for a "government that kills its own people." 
</P>
<P>
Her producers were angry and confused by her stand, she said, and instead of 
allowing her and Perry to leave, they were moved to another hotel, away from 
the Chinese members of the cast. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the other Chinese cast members about the massacre as soon as I found 
out, but they just denied it," Gates said. "Then I began to notice a definite 
break: The Chinese actors couldn't look or smile at me. I was later told that 
no one on the crew was allowed to speak to me. The officials told them nothing 
and didn't want me to tell them what had happened. As far as the crew was 
concerned, no one had been killed and their wives and children in Beijing were 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
When Gates and Perry tried to relay to their Chinese co-workers what they had 
heard, the government officials labled the Americans liars. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, said Perry, the officials told them: " 'You have your news from 
America and we have our news, which is the truth.' " 
</P>
<P>
Days later, officials told Gates and Perry they could leave, but that the 
Chinese would not help them get out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically stuck," Gates said. "Neither of us spoke the language or had 
a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, help arrived from the China Film Import and Export, a Chinese-owned, 
American-based company that helped them get the roles in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. State Department called us and told us to get out," Gates said. "But 
it was Charlene Chin, the person from China Film, who personally telephoned the 
general and asked him to let us leave. I had been very vocal, and Charlene told 
me that she could only get me out if I kept quiet." 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 a.m. on June 8, Gates and Perry took a cab from their hotel to the 
Xi'an airport, where they waited for more than six hours in a terminal crowded 
with people eager to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
Although she wasn't sure they would get a flight, Gates had come prepared with 
negatives of photos she had taken -- including pictures of student 
demonstrators -- hidden underneath her clothes and a diary of her trip buried 
among her curlers. She had been warned by one of her directors about traveling 
with her photos. But Gates, who hopes to turn the pictures and the diary into a 
book about her experience in China, believed the risks were worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
"I was terrified I might get caught," she said. "So, I got one of those big 
exercise bras and taped my money and the pictures, using surgical tape," she 
said with a laugh, adding "that was the only thing I could find." 
</P>
<P>
"Then I put on a lot of clothing. I wore a leotard, a shirt, and a sweater. If 
they had done a strip search, I would have been up the creek." When the pair 
was finally booked on a flight to Canton, she said, security guards "only did a 
cursory pat search." 
</P>
<P>
From Canton, they took a boat to Hong Kong, where they waited for three days, 
sleeping on the airport floor among the throngs of people waiting for a flight 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so crowded. But Hong Kong was the closest international airport other 
than the ones in Beijing and Shanghai. We just took the first plane we could 
get on out of Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
Four flights, one boat ride and a week later, Gates finally returned to her 
home and worried husband in North Hollywood, her diary and her negatives 
intact. Gates said the film was more than 90% completed when she quit, and she 
expects that the producers will piece the remaining scenes together without 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is still filming and they're still telling them that nothing 
happened in Tian An Men Square," she said. "They even tried to convince me that 
nothing happened. Before I left, they questioned me about what I told the crew 
and what I thought. 
</P>
<P>
"When I told them the truth, they denied it. So I just nodded and smiled."

ROBERT HILBURN: 'RAINBOW WARRIORS' SMASHES SALES RECORDS IN THE SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Rainbow Warriors" was one of the biggest-selling albums of the year even 
before it hit the U.S. record shops this week. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the collection -- a two-record compilation featuring previously 
released tracks by more than two dozen of today's most prized rock acts -- has 
sold 4 million copies in the Soviet Union since it was released there on March 
6. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the phenomenal Soviet sales: "Rainbow Warriors" is a 
breakthrough in a country that has been notoriously slow to accept contemporary 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
While the collection is still not a total survey of what's happening today in 
rock (there's no heavy metal, rap or post-punk), the album does represent the 
first time Soviet record stores have carried an album that showcases what might 
best be described as "up-to-date rock." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, rock albums -- which have to be released in any quantity through 
Melodiya, the government record label -- have either been decade-old 
collections by the likes of the Beatles or Moody Blues or the special Paul 
McCartney package of '50s rockers. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the vinyl and cassette versions of "Rainbow Warriors" offers 27 
selections, including such socially conscious works as U2's "Pride (In the Name 
of Love)," Peter Gabriel's "Red Rain," Sting's "Love Is the Seventh Wave," 
R.E.M.'s "It's the End of the World As We Know It," Lou Reed's "Last Great 
American Whale" and Bruce Hornsby's "Look Out Any Window." In addition, the CD 
version contains four additional tracks, including Hothouse Flowers' "Hard 
Rain" and Robbie Robertson's "Somewhere Down the Crazy River." 
</P>
<P>
That sales explosion -- another million copies are expected to be sold in the 
Soviet Union by Christmas -- is exactly the excitement envisioned by the 
album's sponsor, Greenpeace, the international environmental advocacy 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We always had a lot of rock artists giving donations, but we hadn't actually 
approached them for support before," Cornelia Durrant, chairman of Greenpeace 
in England and one of the key figures behind the album, said during a recent 
interview in London. 
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace is very keyed to creating our own publicity, so we haven't needed 
to use celebrities in the past, but we felt we needed their help this time. 
These rock artists are literally worshipped by young people in Russia and we 
saw them as our ticket into the country. It was a way to raise funds for the 
Greenpeace chapter there and draw attention to our goals." 
</P>
<P>
Besides contributing tracks to the album, various bands -- most notably R.E.M. 
on its recent arena tour -- have been allowing Greenpeace volunteers to 
distribute informational material at their concerts. 
</P>
<P>
This involvement, in effect, has made Greenpeace the rock community's new 
charity of choice, assuming the position held in recent years by Amnesty 
International. The latter involvement was climaxed by an unprecedented 
five-continent tour featuring Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel and Sting. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Durrant said, the rash of rock benefits -- from Live Aid through 
the Amnesty tour -- had made Greenpeace wary of turning to the musicians for 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"The more people use a particular device or method for promoting issues, the 
less effective it becomes over time. People get a bit bored with it. It's like, 
'Oh, here come the rock stars again . . . ' and they tune out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ian Flooks, one of England's leading rock agents and the album's executive 
producer, said the rock connection was perfect for what the organization wanted 
to do in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to find a way of raising money for Greenpeace outside of any 
government influence . . . as many individual donations from as large a number 
of people as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace had looked into doing a record a few years ago, but it did not seem 
possible. But this time, we found nothing but cooperation on the part of the 
Russians. Once we had it approved, we realized there was no reason why we 
shouldn't use it in as many countries as possible . . . raising more funds and 
raising awareness on a worldwide level. My objective is to make this the first 
record ever released in every country in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Sales in most countries aren't expected to match the hot pace of the Soviet 
Union figures, but they should be strong -- given the line-up that also 
includes such names as Sting, the Grateful Dead, Talking Heads, Simple Minds 
and John Cougar Mellencamp. The album was released in the United States by 
Geffen Records, and sales are expected to reach the 1 million level. 
</P>
<P>
DRIVIN' N' CRYIN'/LINGERIE -- There's a song ("Honeysuckle Blue") on the new 
album by the rock group Drivin' N' Cryin' that is so wonderfully evocative that 
it alone was enough reason to check out the Atlanta quartet's appearance 
Thursday night at the Lingerie, where it opened for the recently reviewed House 
of Freaks. The song is a bittersweet tale of sad regret about lost ideals and 
endangered environment that has the fresh breath of a strong, original pop 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
But Drivin' N' Cryin' showed little of that distinctive style in the opening 
two-thirds of its hour set at the club, serving up instead some undernourished 
Led Zeppelin power-rock and some overstated Tom Petty roots-rock. 
</P>
<P>
The colorlessness of the music was underscored when the band, led by 
singer-songwriter Kevn Kinney, finally got around to "Honeysuckle Blue" and 
followed it with an equally rewarding "Straight to Hell." The latter is a 
country-accented story -- reminiscent of the Flying Burrito Brothers in its 
sense of naked emotion -- about a young boy being cast aside by his family and 
his town. 
</P>
<P>
There is such a gap between these songs and the rest of the band's set that the 
band ought to sit down and listen to a tape of the show and see which direction 
it wants to follow: the mostly colorless hard rock or the more engaging and 
original tone of "Honeysuckle Blue" and "Straight to Hell." If the vote ends up 
a tie, count this as an offer to cast the deciding vote. 
</P>

DANCER MEDITATES ON GROWING OLDER IN 'ANCIENT TERRAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time doesn't come on little cat feet when you're a dancer, and Heidi Duckler 
knows it. But that doesn't mean she is ready to hang up her leotard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 36 and at a crossroads in terms of being a dancer," she says. Which is why 
she has taken Terpsichore by the horns and created a dance about aging. 
</P>
<P>
Her Collage Dance Theatre presents its multimedia, non-linear "meditation" 
titled "Ancient Terrain" at the Santa Monica Museum of Art today, Sunday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Collage's members, "Ancient Terrain" features a dozen dancers 
from ages 6 to 86. Choreographed interludes alternate with interviews of the 
dancers and others projected on a 7-foot video monitor. 
</P>
<P>
The piece was conceived in collaboration with video artist Hali Paul, visual 
artist John Garrett, composer Eric Schmidt and writer Jim Kruscoe. They began 
work on the project more than a year ago and have received funding from the 
National/State/County Partnership Program. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a limited lifetime as a dancer and (yet) you aren't willing to give 
it up," Duckler says. "So you begin to wonder if it's possible to speak through 
someone else's body." 
</P>
<P>
She put an ad in the trade newspapers calling for dancers of all ages because 
she "wanted to deal with movement on different bodies at different points in 
people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
Working with this unusual group made Duckler examine her own dancer's values. 
</P>
<P>
"As you get older, your perspective on your art changes and priorities change," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that paradox: Just as you really know what you want to say or you finally 
have something to say (as a dancer), your body's limitations on your being able 
to say it begin to appear." 
</P>
<P>
Duckler also came face to face with her own preconceptions about age. What 
challenged her most was combining respect for the senior dancers with the 
imperatives of getting the choreography set. 
</P>
<P>
"On one level, I thought, 'Well, who am I to tell someone who's 85 how to 
move?' It seemed so presumptuous and I didn't want just to impose (my ideas on 
them)," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to elicit an original inspiration from the dancers, to get them to 
use their own (movement) vocabularies and to shape the movement that grew out 
of who they were in terms of age and their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"And it was hard. Especially with my dancers, who'd say, 'Just tell us what you 
want us to do and we'll do it.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Eimi Guirao, a 26-year-old member of Collage, says the "experience of working 
with a whole range of people, (including) artists and people who aren't usually 
dancers," made the new work "rewarding, but also trying." 
</P>
<P>
Morris Hattem, 72, has danced much of his life. He echoes Guirao's enthusiasm, 
calling the process "stimulating." 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows? Maybe I'll be a ballet dancer in my later years," he says. "I never 
thought that I'd be getting feedback from so many different ages and 
temperaments." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Duckler had done her homework by going to senior centers and dance 
classes and talking with people of various ages, she was still surprised. None 
of her excursions quite prepared her for, say, "the vitality of one woman who 
had found yoga in her 70s." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Duckler ready for the emotions unleashed when the participants in the 
show were interviewed on video. 
</P>
<P>
"People cried. They started thinking about their mortality, attitudes toward 
death, aging, childhood and their regrets," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"One woman's daughter had died, and she didn't know how to answer the question 
of whether she was a mother," Duckler says. "It was odd because something so 
natural -- such a part of the life cycle -- wasn't with her. 
</P>
<P>
"Another man hadn't danced for years and was very contemplative about whether 
he'd made the right choices," she says. 
</P>
<P>
All of these shared experiences have combined to change Duckler's understanding 
of age. "What is old?" she asks. "I'm beginning to think that there's only 
older." 
</P>
<P>
"Aging is something that happens to all of us all the time, but I've barely had 
time to even touch upon what it means. I think I've begun to understand it as a 
continuum, with the cycle going on and on. One human life span is so small 
compared with the immensity of time." 
</P>
<P>
Which doesn't mean Duckler believes that one life can't make a difference. She 
thinks it's incumbent upon everyone -- especially her peers -- to fight 
prejudice against age. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are -- the baby boom generation -- we were all so important when we 
were young," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"And now we're aging, and I'm sure that will make a big difference in the 
climate of the country. I hope it's a good difference, both socially and 
politically."

SENATE OKS LEGISLATION TO PROTECT FLAG

The Senate Friday approved a measure that Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) 
said would "go a long way" toward meeting Supreme Court objections to laws that 
make it a crime to desecrate the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
Biden, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, offered an amendment to the 
existing federal statute that makes it a crime to deface the flag. The bill, 
passed on a voice vote while the Senate was considering child care legislation, 
was sent to the House, which could take it up as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
Biden said that the court overturned a Texas law because, under language of the 
statute, a person who burned the flag could be prosecuted because he knew his 
action would cause "serious offense to others." The court held that such 
prosecution violated the defendant's freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
The senator noted that "the Texas law was not aimed at protecting the integrity 
of the flag in all circumstances. Rather, it was aimed at protecting against 
only those kinds of acts against the flag that would cause 'serious offense to 
others.' " 
</P>
<P>
To be constitutional, he said, a flag burning statute "has to be more neutral . 
. . it cannot be tied to the 'likely communicative impact' of the flag burning 
on other people." 
</P>
<P>
Biden's amendment to the federal flag-burning statute removes language 
suggesting that such an act would "cast contempt" on the flag. His amendment 
simply makes it a crime to knowingly and publicly mutilate, deface, burn, 
display on the floor or ground or trample on the flag.

1 CONVICTION ON REAGAN RANCH FLIGHT UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appellate court Friday reversed one of two counts on which an Army 
private was convicted after he piloted a light plane over then-President Ronald 
Reagan's Santa Barbara ranch. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel in San Francisco ruled 
that Ralph Myers, 34, was simply guarding against self-incrimination when he 
lied to Secret Service agents about why he flew over the ranch the night of 
Aug. 13, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
They let stand, however, Myers' conviction for earlier telling precisely the 
same lie to Federal Aviation Administration officials because things had not 
yet reached the stage of being an obvious criminal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. George Newhouse, who prosecuted Myers, said it is unlikely 
that Myers will be retried on the overturned count. In any event, he said, 
Myers has finished serving his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
After being told by radio to contact FAA officials as soon as he landed at John 
Wayne Airport in Orange County, the judges noted, "Myers and his passenger 
immediately concocted a story about the appellant losing his contact lenses 
while in flight and . . . inadvertently flying into prohibited airspace." 
</P>
<P>
After failing a lie detector test, Myers admitted that he lied in an effort to 
keep his pilot's license and avoid more trouble.

AT TRIAL LINKED TO J. DAVID &amp; CO.; 
</P>
<P>
HUNTER'S LAWYERS LOSE BID FOR DISMISSAL AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam on Friday denied for the third time a 
motion by Nancy Hoover Hunter's lawyers to have her case dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Richard Marmaro argued that prosecutors acted in the "height 
of bad faith" by allowing Tom Shepard, whose firm managed the campaign of 
former Mayor Roger Hedgecock, to testify Wednesday that he pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor count of breaking California campaign contribution laws. 
</P>
<P>
Although this fact was not revealed to the jury, Hunter was a partner in 
Shepard's consulting firm and a co-defendant in the case that led to 
Hedgecock's resignation from office. 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro also argued that a $3,000 check from J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, which 
led to a heated exchange between Shepard and Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen 
Clarke, was irrelevant to the Hunter case. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question from Clarke on Wednesday, Shepard said a statement he 
signed as part of a plea bargain "was like the confessions that Chinese 
students are being forced to sign now." 
</P>
<P>
"It got out of hand," said Marmaro, who also argued that Clarke was trying to 
impeach his own witness when he showed Shepard a copy of his statement "to 
refresh his recollection." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Hunter's conviction in the campaign contribution case was declared 
off-limits by Gilliam at the start of the current fraud trial. 
</P>
<P>
In denying the motion, Gilliam said that Marmaro failed to demonstrate how 
Hunter's defense was compromised by Shepard's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the government is going to try to link my client to that crime," 
Marmaro said, referring to Shepard's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam also said that government prosecutors had the right to impeach Shepard 
after he made the "China comment." 
</P>
<P>
"If the witness volunteers that Mrs. (Hunter) was involved, then I can't help 
you," Gilliam told Marmaro. However, Gilliam did order prosecutors to avoid 
forcing Shepard to reveal that Hunter was involved when he retakes the witness 
stand on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke offered no response to Marmaro's accusations about bad faith. "I 
categorically deny every allegation he made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two prior defense motions to dismiss the case, which were formally filed in 
court last month, were also denied by Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
Investors who lost money when the J. David &amp; Co., owned and operated by 
Dominelli, went bankrupt in 1984 continued to testify Friday. Sandra 
Curtiss-Guerrero said she had several conversations with both Dominelli and 
Hunter as far back as 1977, when she purchased Ginnie Mae bonds from Dominelli. 
</P>
<P>
"She said maybe I would be interested in Jerry's pet project -- those two 
words, pet project -- I remember that vividly," Curtiss-Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Hunter told her that the minimum investment in the "pet project" 
was $50,000, Dominelli authorized an initial investment of $5,000, 
Curtiss-Guerrero testified. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned by Assistant U.S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo, Curtiss-Guerrero testified 
that both Hunter and Dominelli told her that the "pet project" investment in J. 
David would yield a 100% return. But, on cross-examination by Marmaro, 
Curtiss-Guerrero recanted, saying that Hunter merely retrieved papers while 
following Dominelli's orders. However, Hunter's role in convincing her to 
invest $5,000 was stressed by Curtiss-Guerrero, who said, "She did a selling 
job on it, too." 
</P>
<P>
At the close of Friday's session, the 12 jurors and four alternates were 
questioned by Gilliam about having heard anything spoken about the case. One 
juror said that she had been confronted by three people, but told them she 
couldn't talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have made several attempts to have the jury sequestered for 
the remainder of the trial, but Gilliam has not done so. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, defense attorney Robert Brewer Jr. entered another news 
story into the court record as he noted the "biasness" of the San Diego media 
against Hunter.

BILL TO FUND OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER IN S.D. GOES TO ASSEMBLY

<P>
The state Senate has approved use of $15 million in state funds to help develop 
an Olympic training facility near San Diego, despite claims that the money 
could be better used for other programs. 
</P>
<P>
The upper house, by a 28-4 vote, on Thursday sent SB 1403 by Sen. William 
Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) to the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would authorize the payment of $15 million to the San Diego 
National Sports Training Foundation over three years, if the foundation raises 
an equal amount. 
</P>
<P>
The state is supposed to recover the funds, plus interest, through the sale of 
$100 commemorative Olympic license plates to California motorists, according to 
Campbell's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell described the bill as an "exciting opportunity for California to take 
the lead in providing unsurpassed training and support for athletes to compete 
in national and international competition." 
</P>
<P>
He said the facility would be the third in the country but the only one aimed 
at training for the summer games. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dan McCorquodale, D-San Jose, complaining about cuts in mental health 
programs, suggested there were better ways to use the money. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Ed Davis (R-Northridge) and Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) suggested 
that the city and county of San Diego should guarantee repayment of the money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really a loan; it's a gift. It seems to me that this is the wrong way 
to go," Rosenthal said, claiming there was enough money raised by the 1984 
Olympics in Los Angeles to help pay for the training facility.

JULIAN WATER DISTRICT URGES CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may be gold in them thar Julian hills, but there isn't much water -- in 
the hills or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 residents and merchants attended an emergency meeting Wednesday called 
by the Julian Community Service District to discuss a severe water shortage 
plaguing the community. Officials of the water district, which supplies 
downtown Julian, urged strong conservation measures, particularly by merchants. 
</P>
<P>
District officials discussed plans to drill a new well as soon as possible and 
to bring in portable toilets to be used instead of the public restrooms with 
flush toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mountain community has experienced water shortages in past years, 
the lack of adequate rainfall for the third consecutive season has heightened 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The severity of the problem is new, but we've been made aware of the necessity 
of water conservation," said Hank Garfield, managing editor of the Julian News. 
"It's new to actually run out of water. There are some residential users who 
ran out of water Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
However, Garfield said Julian's business people have been practicing 
conservation measures for more than a year now. They have stopped hosing down 
the sidewalks in front of their businesses, and restaurant employees serve 
water only on request, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the the water district's actions, many hotel and restaurant workers 
have not been asked to drastically alter their consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using less water where we can, but at this point we haven't cut back," 
said Richard Scalzo, manager of the Julian Cafe. "The water department notified 
us that there was a problem with the water being low, and we're trying to 
conserve."

CHILD MOLESTER SENTENCED TO 24 YEARS IN STATE PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After an unusual hearing in which both the prosecutor and defense attorney of a 
man convicted of child molestation were sworn in as witnesses, a judge 
sentenced the man to 24 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy term went to Robert (Oink) Wardell, 43, of Ramona. The 300-pound 
Wardell, whose health problems confine him to a wheelchair, showed no reaction 
to the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Wardell had sought to withdraw his July 14, 1987, guilty plea to 10 counts of 
molesting five girls ranging in age from 9 to 13 while he baby-sat them. He had 
claimed that the district attorney's office had promised his sentence would be 
reduced by 12 years if he testified against the girls' parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Put Under Oath 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the fathers is a member of the Hell's Angels, and has put out a 
contract on Wardell's life, Wardell's attorney, David Florance, said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Eichler, who has prosecuted the case since 
Wardell's arrest in November, 1986, was put under oath and told San Diego 
Superior Court Judge Terry O'Rourke that he never met with Wardell and knew of 
no one who had from the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Wardell testified that he met with two district attorney investigators, whose 
names he did not know, and that they agreed his sentence would be reduced if he 
testified against the parents. 
</P>
<P>
The judge questioned Wardell about why he signed a form saying he had not 
received any promises of any reduction or been induced to make the guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
Wardell replied that he didn't think it was necessary for him to describe in 
court the investigators' alleged promises. 
</P>
<P>
An angry O'Rourke suggested to Florance that he had a conflict of interest, 
since he was a witness to what his client understood or knew when he entered 
his plea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorney From Audience 
</P>
<P>
Florance agreed to step aside for the motion and the judge summoned another 
defense attorney, Hodge Crabtree, who was sitting in the audience on another 
case, to step forward and represent Wardell in the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Crabtree initially protested, but later met privately with Wardell and Florance 
and agreed to represent Wardell. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned, Florance was sworn in as a witness and testified that 
Wardell had not told him about the alleged promises from the investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Eichler told the judge it would have been "highly improper" for the 
investigators to talk to Wardell without his lawyer present. He also said there 
was "never any consideration to prosecute the victims' parents. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Wardell has committed perjury today," the judge said in denying the motion 
to withdraw the plea. 
</P>
<P>
Wardell was given the maximum 24-year sentence, and the judge ordered that his 
10-year federal prison term on a kidnaping charge of one of the victims be made 
to run consecutively.

BRAUDE TO CHALLENGE WARNER FAMILY OVER HEIGHT OF 2 TOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to build twin 13-story office buildings next to Woodland Hills' busiest 
intersection is leading to a showdown between Los Angeles City Councilman 
Marvin Braude and members of a prominent movie family. 
</P>
<P>
Braude told Woodland Hills homeowners Thursday night that he will press to 
overturn a 6-year-old city agreement that gives the Warner family authority to 
construct the dual towers on the northeast corner of Ventura and Topanga Canyon 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of the family of late film studio mogul Harry Warner vowed 
Friday to fight any effort to pare down the project -- set for construction in 
late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to down-scale that property at this stage would be an obscenity," 
said Larry Calemine, a Warner family spokesman and one of the original planners 
of nearby Warner Center, which was developed on 1,100 acres of the former 
Warner Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Braude's pledge came during a meeting with members of the Woodland Hills 
Homeowners Organization. 
</P>
<P>
He told residents that the 13-story height would be cut by more than half if 
the City Council approves a new Ventura Boulevard development master plan that 
the city is preparing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strict Height Limits 
</P>
<P>
That plan, developed by a citizens advisory group that has spent 2 1/2 years 
analyzing the 17-mile boulevard block by block, recommends strict height and 
size controls for new construction as a way to prevent future traffic gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ventura-Topanga corner, a 7 1/2-acre site used for a one-story shopping 
center and a bank, the proposal calls for a six-story height limit. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to have the Ventura specific plan approved" by the time leases 
expire, Braude told homeowners. That will occur on June 30, 1993, when a 
Thrifty's drugstore, Wherehouse record shop, Hamburger Hamlet restaurant and 
other shops will close in preparation for the 13-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"That would bring that project down to a more reasonable size," Braude said. 
"We will have some control over that." 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily, Calemine said. He said authorization for 13 stories is legally 
included in the city master plan. 
</P>
<P>
"All city actions have previously approved a 13-story height," he said. "I 
don't see anything to change that." 
</P>
<P>
City officials point out that specific height limits have been imposed on new 
buildings along several sections of Ventura Boulevard in recent years, however. 
The boulevard plan now under consideration would consolidate those controls 
under one ordinance. When the height limit of 13 stories for the corner was 
added to the city zoning ordinance in 1983, Braude was joined by council 
members Joy Picus and Joel Wachs in opposing it. They failed on a 10-3 vote, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30-Year Plan 
</P>
<P>
Calemine said it would be unfair -- and illegal -- for the city to change the 
rules for the corner parcel. He said the Warners have planned for 30 years to 
eventually build the project as "the gateway to Warner Center." 
</P>
<P>
He said the office project will include room for 3,000 cars in aboveground and 
subterranean parking structures. He said the office buildings won't add to 
Ventura Boulevard traffic congestion, which the present city planning effort 
seeks to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done a traffic analysis, and what we're planning to put there will 
generate fewer vehicular trips in a 24-hour period than what's there now," 
Calemine said.

LOW-COST CONDOS ADD HOMES, HOPE TO TROUBLED AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just a block away from the hangouts of gang members and drug dealers, city 
officials and community leaders gathered Friday to praise an innovative Pacoima 
condominium project priced for families trying to buy their first home. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre said he hoped that the example set by the 324-unit 
Griffin GlenOaks complex would be duplicated throughout Los Angeles. The 
Building Industry Assn., during the recent Pacific Coast Builders Conference, 
named the complex the best affordable housing development in the Western United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin GlenOaks, just east of the intersection of Glen Oaks and Van Nuys 
boulevards, is next to Van Nuys Pierce Park Apartments, a federally subsidized 
housing project that Los Angeles police have called a hotbed of drug and gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
The new gated complex, with its Cape Cod-style buildings painted in soft blues 
and browns, is an unexpected sight in a neighborhood where bars shield many 
doors and windows. Alatorre said the developer, Griffin Homes, showed great 
courage by building in such a location. 
</P>
<P>
With help from Los Angeles city officials who eased zoning restrictions and 
speeded up the sometimes-plodding development process, Griffin Homes said it 
was able to sell all 84 units in the first phase of the project at prices 
ranging from $71,000 to $117,000. The company has sold about half the 74 units 
in the second phase, which is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a condominium sold in the San Fernando Valley last month 
was $153,000, according to the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors. The 
average price of a single-family home sold in the Valley was $287,400. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$50-Million Bond 
</P>
<P>
The developer obtained a $50-million bond from the city enabling families with 
moderate incomes -- $35,000 to $50,000 a year -- to secure 30-year mortgages at 
a fixed rate of 8.5%, said Marion L. Kiesling, vice president of sales. A 
special financing package allowed potential homeowners to make down payments as 
low as 3% of the purchase price, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional home loans require minimum down payments of 10%, with most 
30-year, fixed-rate mortgages beginning at more than 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Some skeptics said the project "wasn't the wisest thing to do" because people 
might not be willing to buy in the area, said Paul E. Griffin III, company vice 
president and son of Paul E. Griffin Jr., chief executive officer. But Griffin 
Homes has proved that young families are willing to buy attractive and 
affordable homes in an unattractive area, company representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the buyers are from the Valley, a few from Pacoima itself, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deed Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
Residents began moving into the first-phase units in September. Under an 
agreement with the city, Griffin Homes sold half those units to families with 
moderate incomes. Deed restrictions will ensure that those units are sold to 
moderate-income buyers in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Some units in the second phase will be occupied in September, Griffin said. 
Construction on the third and final phase could begin in two months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Community members attending Friday's ceremonies praised the company for hiring 
local youths for construction work, sweeping up and running errands. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who will work for the company this summer are Shawn Todd, Johnny 
Carter and Antiwaun Carter, who said the project has been well-received by 
neighbors. "It makes everything look nice," Todd said. "It cleans things up." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Jay Frey of the Foothill Division said the condominiums 
have not necessarily cut down on local crime, but they haven't made conditions 
any worse either. The complex appears to be an island of calm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it's holding its own," Frey said. "It hasn't added to the problem 
yet."

<P>
As the founding member of the Burbank Flatlanders Home Protection League, I am 
writing to complain that you published such a sleazy article on the "poll" 
taken regarding public approval of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, 
written bW. McGarry (May 28). 
</P>
<P>
To the best of my knowledge, not one of us homeowners living directly under the 
departure flight path of the airport was interviewed by the pollsters. 
McGarry's attempt to denigrate us "anti-noise crusaders," as he calls us, and 
our efforts to protect our property and our life styles through the political 
process, is shameful. 
</P>
<P>
This is a deadly serious business for those of us directly affected by Burbank 
Airport and the airport authority. We are not just a bunch of whiners and 
malcontents with far too much political power, as we are painted in the 
article. We are a group of honest homeowners who are having this airport and 
its ever-increasing expansion forced down our throats by an unfeeling and 
relentless airport authority. 
</P>
<P>
It is led by Robert W. Garcin, who is supported by members from Pasadena and 
Glendale, who control a two-thirds majority voting power over the city of 
Burbank's members, in spite of the fact that the airport is located in Burbank 
and Burbank's citizens are the most heavily impacted. 
</P>
<P>
Noise is not our only complaint, either. Other issues, such as jet-fuel air 
pollution in an area already designated as having the highest air pollution in 
Southern California and our civil rights as homeowners come to bear. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of many of us Flatlanders, this poll was untruthful, inaccurate 
and misleading. Next time your newspaper conducts a poll such as this, make 
sure that those most affected are consulted as well as those who live in 
communities miles from the airport.

For some years I've been reading of Richard H. Close's objections to Burbank 
Airport, and I would like to comment on his letter of June 3 in reference to 
the Los Angeles Times poll concerning the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Close thinks "the cities of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena should bear the 
majority of the airport noise, since it is their airport." It is their airport 
because the city of Los Angeles didn't want to be one of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
However, is it only residents of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena who use it? No. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Sun Valley, Pacoima, North Hollywood, Studio City, Van Nuys, 
Sherman Oaks, Woodland Hills and other San Fernando Valley communities (all 
part of the city of Los Angeles) use Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there is noise, and it is to be hoped that methods of lessening the noise 
will be effective. Nevertheless, I shudder to think of the consequences if Mr. 
Close and other worthies such as Rep. Howard L. Berman, Assemblyman Richard 
Katz and Councilman Joel Wachs were to be successful in their efforts to close 
Burbank Airport. Besides the inconvenience to those who like the proximity of 
Burbank Airport, we'd all be clogging the 405 to LAX, or the Flyaway in Van 
Nuys would have to enlarge its parking lot and add dozens more buses.

OPINIONS ON OPINION POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Polls have value only when the questions asked are unbiased and the population 
polled is properly chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the results of your Burbank Airport poll, pertinent information 
was either omitted or seriously misrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
A fact remains beyond dispute. Airport noise bothers people. Jet pollution 
(both noise and air) is a serious problem that adversely affects communities 
around the world -- including Japan, where a new runway was prevented from 
being used for some time due to the community's protests. 
</P>
<P>
If someone took a poll in any Los Angeles community and was asked whether or 
not they would mind if a major smog-production factory were added to their 
neighborhood, the answers would be obvious. Yet Burbank Airport is just that -- 
the major smog contributor to the west side of Burbank. Windows and fruit trees 
are covered with a greasy grime, and the community's lungs are forced to 
breathe the results of thousands of gallons of jet fuel dumped into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank has been cited as having some of the worst air quality in the Valley. 
Relatively minor life-style changes have been suggested to help alleviate this 
problem (stop using lighter fluid for barbecues, etc.). Yet, when someone calls 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District to object to the stream of air 
pollution trailing behind a jet on takeoff, they are told, "We used to cite 
planes, but the FAA no longer lets us."! 
</P>
<P>
Clearly it is time for jets and airports to clean up their act and be 
responsible for the mess they create. Our world is too crowded for some to dump 
their pollution unchecked on others.

COUNCILMAN'S INITIATIVE TARGETS MOBIL OIL REFINERY; 
</P>
<P>
BID TO CURB TOXIC ACID OKD FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County election officials formally certified Wednesday that 
Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker's initiative to curb the use of 
hydrofluoric acid at the Mobil Oil refinery has qualified for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Clerk John Bramhall said he was notified by the county 
registrar-recorder's office that a random sample of 500 signatures on Walker's 
petitions found that 91.2% were registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Based on that sample, county officials estimated that 8,938 of the 9,801 
signatures submitted by Walker this month are valid. He had needed 7,241. 
</P>
<P>
"On that basis, it is sufficient to qualify," Bramhall said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's measure would severely restrict the amount of acutely toxic 
hydrofluoric acid that can be stored at any industrial site in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would limit storage to 250 gallons, a fraction of the more than 
29,000 gallons of highly corrosive acid usually stored at the Mobil Oil 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
A thunderous explosion and two-day fire at the refinery in November, 1987, was 
caused by an excess of the acid in a unit that produces unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who has argued that Torrance residents are concerned that the chemical 
poses a safety risk, said he was thrilled by the voters' response to his direct 
mail appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I am positive the initiative will pass," he said. "When it is done, we will 
have a far safer community." 
</P>
<P>
But Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti took a decidedly different view. "The 
signatures are not surprising in that most people are willing to put things on 
the ballot," Carbonetti said. "That doesn't necessarily mean that it will pass 
after the voters have more information and time to think about the issue. We 
will just continue our efforts to communicate with the community." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil last week launched a 24-week advertising campaign aimed at improving the 
refinery's image in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance City Council must now decide whether to adopt the measure as 
written or to put it on a special election ballot in November or the regular 
city ballot in March. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the people of the city of Torrance to be able to resolve this matter in 
the fastest way possible," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
He called on his colleagues to put the measure before voters in November, when 
a Torrance school board election will be held, instead of waiting until March. 
"There is no reason to delay this another four months." 
</P>
<P>
Walker expressed the hope that his colleagues would consider adopting the 
measure outright since thousands of Torrance voters signed his initiative. "I 
sincerely hope that they will look at it with an open mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urged Not to Sign 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Katy Geissert said she has seen no sign that her colleagues are 
inclined to adopt an initiative that they urged voters not to sign. 
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to voters in April, Walker's colleagues accused him of using 
"questionable political tactics" to advance his own political career. Council 
members said Walker, who wants to run for the Legislature, plotted to 
"capitalize politically on the community's fears" about the refinery. Walker 
used an estimated $50,000 in campaign funds to finance the initiative drive. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert said she would rather see the measure on the March ballot to spare the 
expense of a special election and to allow the city's legal staff more time to 
work on a lawsuit that the city filed in April seeking to have the Mobil 
refinery declared a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, an outspoken critic of Walker, said Torrance taxpayers will have to 
pay to defend the initiative if Mobil challenges it in court. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Geissert said Walker's initiative has "a very good likelihood of 
passing" because Torrance residents "are very much concerned" about the 
possibility of a catastrophic accident at the refinery. "They are worried about 
the health and safety issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Add Credence' 
</P>
<P>
Walker said a public vote to support his measure would "add a great deal of 
credence to the city's position" in court. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about the potential danger posed by hydrofluoric acid grew late in 1987 
after a series of incidents, beginning with an accident in October at a 
Marathon refinery in Texas. The Torrance explosion and fire followed. And in 
December, an environmental group released the results of oil industry-sponsored 
tests that showed that releases of hydrofluoric acid were more dangerous than 
previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
However, a risk assessment conducted by consultants for Mobil concluded that 
use of hydrofluoric acid poses almost no risk to Torrance residents. 
</P>
<P>
The city has questioned the adequacy of that study. Walker, who has rejected 
the study out of hand, warns that a 1,000-gallon spill of hydrofluoric acid 
could threaten the lives of tens of thousands of residents near the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"This initiative was the first step in controlling what we all see as a major 
hazard in the community," he said. "This is the one chemical that could impact 
the lives of tens of thousands of people who live miles away from this 
refinery." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects to Be Outspent 
</P>
<P>
Walker said he expects that Mobil will easily outspend him in the coming battle 
for the votes of Torrance residents. 
</P>
<P>
After conducting a public opinion poll and meeting with community leaders 
recently, Mobil found that "we needed to do a better job of communicating with 
the community," Carbonetti said. 
</P>
<P>
The new advertising campaign featuring refinery employees discussing their 
concern about health and safety and their contributions to the community is one 
of the ways that Mobil plans to communicate with residents. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many other things coming up," Carbonetti said, but did not offer 
details.

PARAMOUNT LIFTS OFFER FOR TIME TO $200 A SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS and PAUL RICHTER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playing to its Wall Street and courthouse audiences, Paramount Communications 
on Friday raised its hostile bid for Time Inc. to $200 per share, or 14% more 
than the $175-per-share offer spurned by Time directors a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is conditioned on several factors, and Paramount has publicly 
admitted that it won't be able to actually purchase Time's shares by July 7, 
the day the new offer is set to expire. 
</P>
<P>
But in one bold stroke, Paramount increased the pressure on Time's 12-member 
board and the Delaware judge who will decide whether Time's anti-takeover 
defenses are legal -- including Time's recent decision to acquire Warner 
Communications for $14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount intends to use the new offer as a "referendum" to urge Time 
shareholders to send in their shares by July 7 so that Paramount lawyers can 
argue at a crucial Delaware hearing on July 11 that most Time shareholders 
favor the cash offer on the table. 
</P>
<P>
That strategy -- anticipated by professional Wall Street traders and confirmed 
by a member of the Paramount team -- won't hurt Time shareholders, because 
federal securities law allows shareholders to withdraw any shares they have 
tendered at any time before the offer expires. Even though Paramount is setting 
a "cutoff" date, it expects to extend the solicitation to allow time for the 
Delaware court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Paramount's sweetened offer is meant to erode Time Inc.'s 
argument that the earlier Paramount bid was "inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
The Time board deeply angered some investors one week ago by spurning 
Paramount's cash offer yet substituting no plan that would deliver some cash to 
its own shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Time board elected to pursue a 4-month-old plan to merge with 
Warner but changed the terms of the deal to avoid a shareholder vote. No longer 
would Time and Warner exchange shares in a tax-free deal: Now Time is committed 
to shouldering massive debt to acquire half of Warner's shares for $70 each, 
with the remainder to be acquired for a combination of cash, stock or debt 
equities valued at $70. 
</P>
<P>
The tender offer for Warner is set to expire July 17. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about possible consequences for Warner of Paramount's new offer, 
company spokesman Geoffrey W. Holmes said: "This is a matter for the Time board 
of directors to deal with. We have a firm agreement with Time to which we 
remain committed." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's increased bid received a quick but inconclusive response from Time, 
which advised its shareholders not to act until they hear more from the 
company. A spokesman for the media giant said its board will consider the new 
Paramount offer but he declined to say when the board will convene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Price Jumps 
</P>
<P>
Although Paramount's announcement came after the close of New York Stock 
Exchange trading, shares of Time rose $10.50 to $165.875 on speculative trading 
pegged to a Page 1 story in USA Today, which reported that Paramount would soon 
raise its bid to "around $200 a share." Paramount closed at $58, down 50 cents, 
with more than 1.1 million shares changing hands, while Warner closed at 
$58.625, down 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the new bid would increase Paramount's costs by $1.44 billion, a 
Paramount spokesman insisted that the company intends to hold on to all pieces 
of Time and Paramount, rather than sell off assets to ease the debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts were skeptical. Lisa Donneson, analyst with County NatWest 
USA, said the sweetened bid will put Paramount's debt at about $12 billion in 
1990, or about 8.5 times its annual cash flow from operations. 
</P>
<P>
That debt burden is higher than the load carried by many entertainment or 
publishing companies; it is even higher than the debt load of many cable 
operators, which tend to be heavily leveraged, she noted. "To me that seems 
very high," she said. "That could mean asset sales."

 Mexican investor Joel Rocha Garza, who holds a 6.2% share in Smith 
Laboratories, a San Diego company that makes orthopedic products, said he has 
formed a shareholder group to oppose the proposed merger of the company with 
International Power Machines Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the merger, each share of Smith would be exchanged for a 
share in the new company, and each IPM share would be exchanged for 2.1 shares, 
or $4.50 in cash, according to a U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
filing.

AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, will expand its computerized Sabre 
reservation system over the next 18 months to include hotel and car rental 
information, a spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes one day after American and Delta Air Lines dropped plans 
to combine their reservations system because of opposition from the Justice 
Department, which said it feared the move would lead to higher fares and lower 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The current American Airlines system, called Sabre, is used primarily by travel 
agents to book flights and holds 50% of the nation's travel market.

FAA -- EASTERN FAILED TO MAKE REPAIRS AT BASES

Eastern Airlines has failed to make needed repairs to malfunctioning aircraft 
equipment, even after repeated complaints by pilots, according to a team of 
investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement Friday, the Department of Transportation said the FAA team 
has discovered numerous examples of "chronic failure" to correct equipment 
deficiencies at the strikebound carrier's Miami and Atlanta bases. 
</P>
<P>
"The results indicate that management personnel were allowing aircraft to be 
moved without adequate corrective action," Joseph Doubleday, the FAA inspection 
team leader, wrote in a June 7 report to FAA official Roger V. Gordon. "We feel 
this was driven in part by the intense pressure to meet on-time performance 
goals of a special incentive program." 
</P>
<P>
A copy of Doubleday's report was obtained by Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern disputes the FAA's findings. In a detailed, six-page letter to Gordon 
sent Thursday, John J. Keyser, Eastern's vice president for regulatory 
compliance, said Doubleday's report "lacks needed perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, the FAA manager with lead responsibility for Eastern, was on vacation 
and was unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's unions and others have raised questions about maintenance and safety 
at the Miami-based airline, which has weathered a crippling strike and a 
bankruptcy filing since early March. 
</P>
<P>
Doubleday's report said the Miami investigation did not find "fraudulent or 
forged maintenance documentation as a systemic problem." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the team, which reviewed records for 29 planes from January, 
1988, through May, 1989, discovered problems with Eastern's "continuing 
analysis and surveillance system." Those problems led to chronic failure to 
repair deficiencies reported by pilots, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report cites 30 examples of repairs that weren't made on different aircraft 
despite repeated reports.

PATIENCE IS TAXED TO THE LIMIT IN IRS HORROR STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saundra Williams says she will never forget last Jan. 17, the day a somber IRS 
agent knocked on her front door, questioned her frightened teen-agers about 
their mother's whereabouts and then waited outside in a car for Williams to 
come home from work. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a single mother, had run errands after work -- the sort of stuff that 
busy parents are always having to do -- and missed the caller, instead finding 
a curt note telling her to appear before the IRS at 8 a.m. the next day for 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went into the office, they told me I owed thousands of dollars in back 
taxes, plus a 25% penalty for being negligent, and that I was guilty unless I 
could prove I was innocent," Williams said. "Can you imagine that in America?" 
</P>
<P>
Saundra Faith Williams, mind you, is a well-educated 38-year-old who supports 
two children on her $25,000 salary, drives a Plymouth Reliant and lives a 
law-abiding life in a small apartment in Los Angeles near the Inglewood line. 
But to the IRS, she has been an object of relentless suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS visit in January was for her the final straw in a six-year avalanche of 
wrongful accusations, including that she lied about being a head of household 
and her marital status and failed to report income. Since 1983, the IRS has 
ordered her to repay thousands of dollars, threatened to garnish her wages, 
interrogated co-workers about her and called her as late as 10 p.m. with 
questions. Ultimately, the IRS placed a tax lien against her, causing her to be 
denied credit for years, "a humiliation that I just cannot tell you." 
</P>
<P>
The clincher to this tale is that Williams is utterly innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS says it has gotten to the bottom of the six-year "misunderstanding." On 
May 9 it issued Williams a letter of apology, formally lifted the federal tax 
lien against her and cleared her of all back taxes it once said she owed. 
</P>
<P>
"We again apologize for any inconvenience our actions have caused you . . ." 
read the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Williams estimates she has spent thousands of hours, including one entire 
vacation, going over tax returns, sifting through documents and cooling her 
heels in IRS waiting rooms to prove she has done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Answering letters, replying to questions, returning calls or forms, waiting in 
offices, calling them back again and again -- it's been constant, constant 
stress!" Williams cried to a visitor at her home last week, pounding the 
floral-covered sofa with her fist. 
</P>
<P>
A respected employee of IBM's international parts distribution center in Los 
Angeles, Williams has lost many days from work, where she processes millions of 
dollars in billings and accounts as a customer service representative. 
</P>
<P>
According to Shirley Nakagawa, an IRS spokeswoman, the explanation for most of 
Williams' troubles is actually quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Traced to Ex-Husband 
</P>
<P>
The problems appear to stem from Williams' ex-husband, who apparently signed 
her name to a joint 1979 tax return -- unbeknown to her -- after they had 
separated, Nakagawa said. That year, after her husband moved away, Williams and 
her children struggled by on her $10,000 teaching salary, and she filed her 
return as a single head of household. 
</P>
<P>
But within the IRS, someone concluded that Williams had been naughty. To the 
IRS, it appeared that in 1979 Williams had purposely filed tax returns in both 
the joint category and in the single head of household category, receiving tax 
breaks for both filings. 
</P>
<P>
For the next six years, none of the modest tax refunds that Williams received 
from the government managed to sail through without setting off alarms, even 
though the IRS contends that each year's return is judged on its own merits, 
not on past problems. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS concedes that it did not physically examine the 1979 joint return filed 
by Williams' ex-husband until a reporter for The Times began asking questions 
about it this spring. If IRS investigators had read that joint return six years 
ago, they would have noticed that Williams' signature was not her own. And she 
would not have gone through 75 months of what she calls "IRS hell." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote to President Reagan 
</P>
<P>
"They had my children thinking I was going to jail," Williams said. "After 
years, I mean years of this, I finally wrote to President Reagan. I even called 
(disc jockey) Rick Dees. When they push you so far, you start thinking in crazy 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
One day, Williams said, a repossessor showed up to tow away her new car. It had 
been purchased over a weekend, but by Monday the salesman had received a report 
showing a tax lien against her. 
</P>
<P>
"I begged him in the driveway, I showed him my boxes of IRS letters," Williams 
said. In one of her few victories, she said, the repossessor cursed the IRS and 
drove off. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery began to unravel after Nakagawa, a public relations specialist for 
the IRS, looked into Williams' case at the request of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nakagawa, this is what happened: 
</P>
<P>
"You are not allowed to have two tax returns, so the information from her 
single return and joint return were put together into one document by the IRS. 
When Saundra began calling us asking about her problems and giving us her own 
Social Security number, we did not show any separate return for her. She didn't 
know it, but it had been filed under her husband's number, because husbands are 
used as the primary number." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRS Became More Suspicious 
</P>
<P>
When Williams was unable to produce a copy of her 1979 tax return, the IRS 
became even more suspicious of her tale that she had properly filed one 
separately from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Finally this spring, Nakagawa said, the IRS "found it by locating the joint 
return based on the Social Security number of her husband, which she provided 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Nakagawa now insists that Williams' days of sparring with the IRS are over. The 
IRS says it is instead looking into Williams' ex-husband's taxes. But Williams, 
who has received other apologies from the IRS regarding the same mess, simply 
does not believe them. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS wrote her an apology in 1986, flatly stating that no federal tax lien 
existed against her. Williams was given permission to show the letter to 
creditors. But the lien kept cropping up, and the letter did nothing to 
persuade bank credit officers otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
As if to prove Williams' deep doubts that she is truly free, on May 12 the 
state Franchise Tax Board wrote to her, three days after she was cleared by the 
IRS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Oh Pul-eeeze!' 
</P>
<P>
Said the state: "Based on information from the IRS," she had been found 
negligent of ducking taxes and owed them $221.75 in taxes and penalties. Not 
surprisingly, they are disputing her 1985 claim that she is the head of a 
household. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh pul-eeeze!" Williams hollered up at the ceiling of her tidy apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Nakagawa said Wednesday that Williams should send her various clearance letters 
from the IRS to the state. She said it is not the IRS' responsibility to clear 
up Williams' troubles there. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Williams has already showered the state with her IRS clearance 
letters, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Williams stares at two file boxes and a notebook jammed with her IRS 
correspondence, she says she can't shake a nauseous feeling that the saga will 
never end. She is moving out of state and will remarry this month, and fears 
the IRS will soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's down to this," she said, now quiet and calm. "I'm not paying them one 
dime. They treated me like somebody's criminal. Let's talk about what they owe 
to me."

L.A. TEACHERS TAKE FIRST STEP TOWARD POWER-SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friday should have marked the end of William Boede's 32-year teaching career at 
Franklin Avenue Elementary School. But he postponed his retirement for a year 
to participate in what is bound to be one of the nation's most closely watched 
experiments in public education. 
</P>
<P>
Boede took on a new role Friday as an elected member of a new school governing 
council which, its architects say, gives teachers real clout in running 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Magna Carta for teachers," said Boede, who teaches fifth and sixth 
grades at the Los Feliz school. 
</P>
<P>
Between saying goodby to students and packing up their rooms on the last day of 
classes in the Los Angeles Unified School District, teachers at most campuses 
Friday elected representatives to "shared decision-making" councils. Schools 
that did not hold elections Friday will do so on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers say the councils, which will render decisions on the spending of 
lottery and other money, student discipline codes, scheduling and equipment -- 
including use of the all-important copying machine -- was the main reason why 
they went out on strike for nine days last month. 
</P>
<P>
As spelled out in the new teachers' contract, the councils will have eight to 
16 members and will be established at all the district's more than 600 schools 
by this fall. Teachers will fill 50% of the seats, with the other slots to be 
divided among the principal and representatives of parents, the community and 
school support staff who will be elected later this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Primary Goal 
</P>
<P>
Some see the councils as a modest first step toward the more sweeping types of 
school reorganization being tried elsewhere in the country, but most agree that 
the objective is the same: improving the quality of education by giving 
teachers a stake in the change. 
</P>
<P>
Although schools in Miami and Rochester, N.Y., have been easing gradually into 
new modes of school governance, Los Angeles, by contrast, has jumped headlong 
into a power-sharing arrangement between teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from nothing to something" practically overnight, said United 
Teachers-Los Angeles Vice President Helen Bernstein, who played a key role in 
drafting the contract provisions on shared decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
At San Fernando High School on Friday, teachers seemed eager to get started. 
Clustered at lunch tables in the faculty lounge, they marked their ballots 
quickly to choose seven council members from among 27 nominees. By 11 a.m., 80% 
of the school's 130-member faculty had voted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very interested in working on the budget," said Sheila Roth, an English 
and humanities teacher who ran for the council. "I want to see where the money 
is going. And I want teachers to help set the priorities (for spending it)." 
</P>
<P>
Another council candidate, English teacher Bettie Kapiloff, said she was more 
interested in trying to affect some of the less lofty, but crucial, aspects of 
daily school operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to (improving) the logistical things that make teachers' lives 
better, like having access to the Xerox machine," said Kapiloff. "We have been 
treated like tall children. We've been told we can't make more than eight 
copies (at a time). Or, 'You can make copies, but you can't do it now, come 
back later.' It's that kind of thing that adult professional people should not 
have to put up with. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting. It's so exciting," she added. "For too long, we have been 
puppets in the hands of those who are the most far removed from the classroom. 
. . . Education will never be the same again." 
</P>
<P>
Terri Turner, another San Fernando High English teacher, said she did not run 
for the council because she already has too many extra responsibilities. But 
she said she would give it her full support, especially if it tackles her pet 
peeve: bell schedules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Frustrating' 
</P>
<P>
"We are forever being told to forgo teaching to allow schedules to be changed 
for assemblies and other 'priorities,' " she said. "It's frustrating for 
teachers to have lesson plans and at the last moment have a schedule (change) 
that makes it totally impossible to teach." 
</P>
<P>
At Franklin Elementary, the faculty already has discussed having its school 
council serve as the umbrella group for existing committees, such as the parent 
advisory council, said UTLA chapter chairman Bill Fink. But he said that 
because of a longstanding spirit of cooperation between Franklin's teachers and 
Principal Verna Dauterive, the creation of the decision-making council will not 
require as dramatic an adjustment as it might at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the things they've given us (in the shared decision-making agreement) 
we've already done," Fink said, such as working with Dauterive to produce a 
student discipline code and spend their school's share of state lottery money. 
</P>
<P>
Dauterive said she welcomes the councils and does not feel threatened by their 
power. But she acknowledged that some principals may view them differently. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an element of insecurity and concern about loss of power and control" 
among some principals, she said, because they believe they are the ones who 
will ultimately be held accountable for council decisions as well as for 
overall school performance. 
</P>
<P>
But the Franklin principal predicted that over time those fears will diminish. 
"I find that (shared decision-making) is the most ideal way to work. Principals 
will find they have greater commitment to make schools work when they involve 
people in making decisions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Training Workshops Planned 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, the UTLA vice president, said much work lies ahead to educate 
administrators and teachers about the shared decision-making process. "In some 
cases, there are very insensitive, autocratic, unresponsive principals. We 
don't want to replace that with eight uncaring teachers," she said. "That is a 
real danger." 
</P>
<P>
Over the summer break, the union plans to hold training workshops for chapter 
chairs as well as for union appointees to a new districtwide central committee 
that will oversee more sweeping school restructuring efforts. The district and 
the union plan to jointly offer training to individual council members, 
including the parent and community representatives.

ROCK HUDSON CASE LAWYER 1 OF 3 AIR CRASH VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prominent Los Angeles lawyer who represented celebrities and recently won a 
landmark, $21-million award for Marc Christian against the estate of Rock 
Hudson was identified Friday as one of three people killed in a plane crash a 
day earlier in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Rhoden, 66, of Northridge was killed with his wife, Sheila, 40, and his 
mother-in-law, Ceil Rauch, 61, of Lake Worth, Fla., said Los Angeles County 
coroner's spokesman Robert Dambacher. Rhoden's daughter, Lorraine, 13, who was 
also in the aircraft, was reported in critical condition at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden, who had practiced law in Los Angeles since 1952, was piloting the 
single-engine, four-seat Trinidad TB-21 that went down after it apparently 
developed engine trouble and struck some power lines. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, his clients included Christian, who was awarded $21.75 million 
from the late actor's estate earlier this year. A jury had found that Hudson 
and his personal secretary were negligent because they hid the actor's AIDS 
from Christian, Hudson's homosexual lover. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a judge slashed the award to $5.5 million, but attorneys for Hudson's 
estate have appealed. Robert Parker Mills, an attorney for the estate, said 
Friday that he did not know how Rhoden's death will affect the case. Both sides 
were in the process of filing their opening briefs, and no oral arguments had 
been scheduled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigating Crash 
</P>
<P>
Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal 
Aviation Administration were investigating the cause of the crash, which 
occurred about 2:10 p.m. Thursday in a ravine near Sierra Highway in Santa 
Clarita, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, "as he was going down, the tail of the airplane clipped 
a high-voltage wire which caused him to nose-dive down into the ground," Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. David Stunson said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes earlier, Rhoden had spoken twice by radio with air traffic controllers 
at Van Nuys Airport, his destination on a flight from Sacramento, Van Nuys 
Airport spokesman Bob Hayes said. Rhoden reported having engine trouble and 
asked for directions to a closer airport before the crash, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden's secretary said she did not know precisely why her boss was in 
Sacramento, saying she knew only that the trip "had something to do with the 
plane" and "had nothing to do with law." Rhoden's family had gone along for the 
weekend, secretary Tip Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said Rhoden left for Sacramento June 16 and had intended to return two 
or three days later, but on Monday, he phoned to say "he was detained; he had 
engine trouble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Licensed Pilot 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden, a licensed pilot since 1947, called Phillips again Thursday morning to 
report that the problem had been fixed and that he was returning to Los 
Angeles, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really go into what was wrong with the plane," Phillips said. "He 
just complained about it and made a few jokes" about the problem, she said. 
</P>
<P>
NTSB investigators could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden's career included several high-profile cases. He was a close associate 
of celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, who said he worked with Rhoden 
on at least 50 cases in the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden and Mitchelson repre sented Bianca Jagger in her 1979 divorce from rock 
star Mick Jagger. The duo also represented the wife of international arms 
merchant and Iran-Contra figure Adnan Khashoggi in a 1982 divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Rhoden represented Mitchelson when a jury cleared the lawyer of 
charges in a $6.5-million civil suit filed by a former Mitchelson client who 
accused him of rape. 
</P>
<P>
"I would describe him as a lawyer's lawyer," a tearful Mitchelson said of 
Rhoden. "He was absolutely erudite . . . knew the law, in all the time I had 
seen him, better than his opponents and much of the time better than the 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchelson said he introduced Rhoden to his second wife, Sheila. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fine Gentleman' 
</P>
<P>
"His most outstanding quality was that he was a very fine gentleman," said Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Bruce R. Geernaert, who presided over the Hudson 
case. "The jurors liked him very much. . . . Mr. Rhoden was very, very calm and 
cool." 
</P>
<P>
Mills, who opposed Rhoden in the case, described him as "a hard-nosed bulldog." 
He said Rhoden "chose to try this case all the way through . . . even if it 
might mean that they could get less money at some point in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden also played a prominent role in a contest over the estate of Howard 
Hughes. One of Hughes' associates designated Rhoden as the substitute executor 
of a handwritten will that named a gas station attendant, Melvin Dummar, among 
the beneficiaries and that was contested by four Hughes cousins not named in 
the will. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden spent two years trying to prove the authenticity of the will, but a jury 
ruled in 1978 that the document was a fake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lengthy Battle 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, Rhoden waged a lengthy legal battle against Litton Industries on 
behalf of a man who claimed a founding interest in the company. He won a 
$7.5-million award for his client in 1965. During the course of the case, 
Litton filed a $40-million libel suit against Rhoden and others, but the suit 
was later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden served in World War II as a tail gunner on a B-24 bomber and was a 
prisoner of war in Germany after the plane crashed in Austria, Phillips said.

OFFICERS SPOT APARTMENT HOUSE BLAZE, HELP EVACUATE 31 SAFELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A suspected arson fire that started in a construction site near MacArthur Park 
early Friday spread to an adjacent fourplex, leaving 31 people homeless, 
authorities said. No one was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Residents were quickly evacuated after two Rampart Division police officers, 
Tom Walker and Ken Sanchez, spotted the flames and sounded the alarm at 1:22 
a.m. with the siren of their patrol car and with a loudspeaker warning in 
English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The officers joined RTD police officers, who were cruising in the area, and 
hurried through the building, knocking on doors and waking residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them didn't want to go," Sanchez said. "They wanted to grab some 
possessions, but we told them they had to get out." 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, outside the burned structure at 808 S. Grand View St., residents 
stood in the bright sunshine and waited -- for something. 
</P>
<P>
"It's often like that," said a worker around noontime at an empty Red Cross 
evacuation center set up at Belmont High School near downtown Los Angeles. 
"They stay at the scene, apparently hoping that what happened to them will go 
away." 
</P>
<P>
But reality was all too apparent to Margarita Hurate and her two sons, ages 1 
1/2 and 5; to William and Sylvia Cabreria and their two sons, Henry, 5, and 
Danny, 3; to a dozen members of the George and Coila Garcia family, and to the 
other victims. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 31 people who lived in the old two-story building lost everything 
and had nothing but the clothes they wore. Others managed to save some things, 
which were piled in the front yard and at the curb. Children took turns holding 
a scorched and broken statue of the baby Jesus claimed after the fire was 
extinguished at 2:02 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sleeping," said Marcos Garcia, 17, a sturdy youth wearing a leather 
jacket. "We heard screaming, 'Fire! Fire!' and my mom and dad took the kids 
out. All my family is all right." 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody was slapping me," said William Cabreria, a Department of Water and 
Power landscaper. "I looked out and saw the flames, and I went looking for the 
fire extinguisher, but by then, it was getting too late. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Trousers 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up my wife and started out, but then I saw I didn't have any pants, so 
I grabbed a pair and got out." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven fire companies -- about 55 men -- responded to the alarm. Damage was 
estimated at $50,000 to the fourplex and $80,000 to the partially framed 
apartment house next door at 822 S. Grand View. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Fire Chief James Young said virtually no work had been done on the 
apartment project for the past 18 months, and the nearby fire company had asked 
the owner to hire a security guard for the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We always try to get them to do that, but it doesn't always work," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said they found 10 to 15 transients who apparently had been 
living in a completed underground garage at the construction site, including a 
woman who suffered minor scratches and burns. One resident said she had 
complained to police that drugs were being sold at the site. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon Friday, the Red Cross said that about half of those who 
escaped the blaze had showed up at the Belmont High evacuation center.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RIFLE FOUND IN HOME; BOY, 11, WOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 11-year-old South El Monte boy playing at a friend's home was accidentally 
shot in the head after he and the friend found a .22-caliber rifle they did not 
realize was loaded, sheriff's deputies said. The boy, whose name was not 
released, was in extremely critical condition on a life-support system at 
Greater El Monte Community Hospital, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dan Cox said the boy was one of four playing at a friend's home when the 
friend, a 14-year-old boy, began handling the gun. "Unbeknownst to him, it was 
loaded," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
When the older boy pulled the trigger, the gun fired once, and the single 
bullet hit the 11-year-old in the head, Cox said. Neither the 14-year-old nor 
the other two boys playing in the house were hurt, he said. Sheriff's homicide 
detectives have declared it an accidental shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said deputies did not yet know whether either parent was home at the time, 
nor had they learned where the rifle was kept.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTOR'S PRISON TERM TO START TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Kenneth Swofford, who played a school principal in the television series 
"Fame," is to begin serving a 28-month state prison term Tuesday for a 
drunk-driving collision that seriously injured a man and his two sons. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Richard Kolostian has allowed Swofford, 55, to 
remain free from custody until Tuesday, when he must surrender to begin serving 
his prison term. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 23, Swofford pleaded no contest to a single felony charge of driving 
under the influence of alcohol and causing injuries to others. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that after drinking at a bar in Studio City on Dec. 17, 
Swofford drove his car the wrong way on Ventura Boulevard and crashed into a 
car driven by George Charouhas, 37, and containing his two sons. The impact of 
the collision sent Charouhas' car careening into a third vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Charouhas suffered two fractured vertebrae and a broken knee; his son, Paul, 
11, suffered a fractured skull and pelvis and was in a coma for a week after 
the accident; and his other son, Steven, 6, suffered a broken leg in the crash.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REDEVELOPMENT UNIT ASSAILED ON DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Grand Jury's report, which last week criticized the West 
Covina Redevelopment Agency as inefficient and disorganized, has recommended 
that the city reconsider the proposed terms of a $117-million mall expansion, 
scheduled for approval on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury urged the West Covina City Council and Redevelopment Agency to 
negotiate a better deal for the proposed Fashion Plaza shopping mall expansion. 
The developers, Sylvan S. Shulman and May Centers Inc., are asking for all of 
the new property tax revenue and more than 75% of the sales taxes created by 
the expansion. The project would add a new department store and additional mall 
space. 
</P>
<P>
City officials argued with the report's conclusion, saying the grand jury's 
recommendation was misguided, based on incorrect conclusions, and that the deal 
was the best the city could expect. Two private economic consultants have 
supported the city's contribution to the project, which city officials say is 
needed to safeguard the current sales tax base. 
</P>
<P>
The city is preparing a formal response to the grand jury's report.

LAKE AVE. PASTOR SPURNS LEADERSHIP POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Paul Cedar of Pasadena, elected overwhelmingly Thursday as the new 
president of Evangelical Free Church of America, surprised the denomination's 
delegates hours later by saying that he would not accept because he didn't 
believe that God wanted him to. 
</P>
<P>
Free Church officials said that the current president, Thomas McDill, would 
delay his retirement until a new nominee can be found. 
</P>
<P>
Only last month, Cedar had told his 4,500-member Lake Avenue Congregational 
Church in a long letter how, after months of wooing by the Minneapolis-based 
denomination, he had decided that it was God's will to accept the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am elected by an overwhelming majority of votes, we will rejoice that the 
Lord is calling us to that exciting ministry even though it would be extremely 
difficult to leave you dear brothers and sisters," Cedar wrote. His church this 
year began worshiping in a $20-million church complex overlooking the Foothill 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelical Free Church officials said that Cedar told delegates meeting in 
Kenosha, Wis., "that after much prayer and reflection he felt he was not being 
called of God to lead the Evangelical Free Church. He shared instead with the 
delegates his belief that God was preparing someone within the Free Church 
ranks to take the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
Cedar, originally ordained a Free Church minister, is now a Congregationalist 
pastor.

DENOMINATION LEADERS OPPOSE MOVE;

LUTHERANS MAY INVITE GAY TO LEAD MINISTRY

In one of three recent moves around the country to extend church acceptance to 
homosexuals, some Lutherans in the San Francisco Bay Area say they may call an 
openly homosexual seminary graduate to lead a special ministry with the city's 
gay and lesbian community. 
</P>
<P>
The prime candidate is Jeff Johnson of Lancaster, is one of three openly gay 
seminarians refused ordination last year. The three refused to make a pledge to 
abstain from homosexual acts as demanded for the clergy by the 
5.3-million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the nation's 
fourth-largest Protestant body. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials in the denomination's Chicago headquarters said they would not 
recognize the ordination as valid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Must Be Certified' 
</P>
<P>
Two Lutheran congregations, St. Francis in San Francisco and St. Paul in 
Oakland, have voted their willingness to engage openly gay and lesbian 
ministers on their staffs, according to the Rev. James DeLange, pastor of St. 
Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"While authority to select pastors lies within the congregation, under current 
Lutheran rules the ordination must be certified by the regional bishop," said 
DeLange in an interview. "However, there is historical precedent in Lutheranism 
for congregations to ordain pastors," he added. 
</P>
<P>
DeLange also noted that if Johnson were ordained by a congregation, any clergy 
taking part would risk disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a "covenant of support" for the proposed ministry, which commits 
signers "to participate in the ordination of Jeff Johnson . . . who has been 
certified to be qualified for the ministry of word and sacrament" has already 
been signed by more than 200 people, including 40 clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was certified as qualified to be ordained by a committee of the 
Lutheran Church in America -- a predecessor body of the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church in America -- shortly before he graduated last year from Pacific 
Lutheran Theological Seminary in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson's bishop refused to accept the certification after Johnson refused 
to pledge himself to lifelong celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bishop Lyle Miller of the Northern California-Northern Nevada synod 
said last week in a statement: "While we affirm ministry to and with gay and 
lesbian people, we do not endorse a ministry of ordained people who are not in 
compliance with the guidelines of the ELCA that ordained pastors are not to be 
practicing homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Condemned Homophobia' 
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of the church in this synod is very much standing with lesbian and 
gay people," Johnson said in an interview with United Press International. He 
said at the synod's convention in March that delegates "overwhelmingly 
condemned homophobia as a sin and urged congregations to undertake programs to 
eradicate it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fewer problems seemed to be in store for a Minnesota congregation 
accepted into the United Church of Christ and for an Episcopal diocese-backed 
ministry in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The Spirit of the Lakes Ecumenical Community Church in Minneapolis became the 
nation's first openly homosexual congregation to join a mainline church when it 
was accepted into the United Church of Christ in April, its leader said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we're breaking ground and leading the way for other churches and 
other denominations to open up and recognize gay and lesbian people's rightful 
place in the church," said the Rev. Dan Geslin, pastor of Spirit of the Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Most Christian churches accept homosexuals as members, equally beloved by God 
as others, but condemn the practice of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
But the United Church of Christ, a 1.8-million-member Protestant church formed 
from a 1957 merger, approved in 1969 its first resolution supporting civil 
rights for homosexuals, and three years later it became the first mainline 
denomination to ordain an openly gay minister. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Master's Degree 
</P>
<P>
Geslin, 39, received a master of divinity degree from the Pacific School of 
Religion, a United Church of Christ-affiliated school in Berkeley. He took over 
as pastor of Spirit of the Lakes in September and immediately began pursuing 
membership in the denomination. 
</P>
<P>
In Newark, N.J., Episcopal Bishop John S. Spong this week established a new 
ministry called The Oasis, designed to make homosexuals feel more welcome in 
the church. Led by a deacon who is openly homosexual, the ministry will work 
out of an office in All Saints Episcopal Church in Hoboken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"We take seriously the baptism vow of our church 'to respect the dignity of 
every human being,' " said Spong, who is author of the controversial book, 
"Living in Sin? A Bishop Rethinks Human Sexuality."

WEST COVINA BOY, 6, PULLS HIS DROWNING MOTHER TO SAFETY WITH A POOL SKIMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old boy fished his drowning mother out of their swimming pool in West 
Covina on Friday with the help of a long-handled pool skimmer, saving her life, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Montano's son Jorge helped to pull his mother to safety after she grabbed 
onto the 8-foot pole he extended to her as she flailed about in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
The boy then summoned help at his mother's instruction, telling an emergency 
operator, "Somebody is pulling my mommy into the pool!" 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, they found the mother drenched and "visibly shaken" but 
safe, said West Covina Police Cpl. Derrell Griffith, who has recommended the 
boy for a commendation. Montano, who does not swim, was cleaning the pool when 
she fell in, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid had the presence of mind to do what he needed to do," said Griffith.

THE 'SORCERY' FUND-RAISER CANCELLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was sorry to read on the front page of Calendar ("O.C. 'Sorcery' Fund-Raiser 
Goes Poof" by Mark I. Pinsky, June 15) that once again the religionists were 
allowed to dictate what others can do, think and see. 
</P>
<P>
I was sorry to read that the Laguna Playhouse decided that the Rev. Jerry 
Tankersley knows more about what is good and righteous for adult, intelligent 
theatergoers than they do. The Laguna Playhouse should have had a little more 
courage and just said no to religious bigotry and meddling. 
</P>
<P>
I was looking forward to a night of psychics and palmists but can't since this 
evening offended a minister's personal religious standard that he has forced on 
me. I resent a minister of a church that I do not attend telling me what I can 
do, see or hear.

I think that the Laguna Playhouse should reschedule the event. Anyone who does 
not want to attend the party will not be forced to go. The Rev. Tankersley does 
not speak for me. I will not allow him to think for me, either.

BROWNE CONCERT

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Randy Lewis' review of Jackson Browne's "World in Motion" (Calendar, 
June 4): 
</P>
<P>
In a world so full of blatant hate, greed and destruction, there are only a few 
people willing to open their hands, hearts and/or talents to those in need. 
Jackson Browne is one of those rare few who has dedicated his life and, 
currently, his career to making a difference. Through his music, Jackson 
reaches out, even if only to a group of his admirers, in an effort to spread an 
awareness of, and a desire to question, the wars, our leaders and even 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Jackson's last two albums have more "passionate views on a plethora of 
topics" than his prior albums, but they are no less poetic or artistic. "Lives 
in the Balance," the title cut off his 1986 album, is an extremely powerful and 
well-written song; it did not receive the recognition it deserved. His new 
album contains several outstanding songs, including but not limited to "When 
the Stone Begins to Turn," "Enough of the Night," and the title cut. 
</P>
<P>
It is uncertain to me why Randy Lewis' review was so critical of a man who -- 
as another journalist, Steve Hochman, indicated in his Nov. 6 article ("Jackson 
Browne, Mr. Benefit") -- professionally has everything to lose with his 
politically motivated songs.

WITT ENDS A COUPLE OF STREAKS; 
</P>
<P>
HIS SIX-HITTER STOPS ORIOLE VICTORIES AT 7, ANGEL LOSSES AT 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Individually they are called starting pitchers, but collectively they are known 
as a rotation, because with starting pitching, everything that goes around 
usually comes around. 
</P>
<P>
Examine the state of the Angels' rotation: 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill, once 7-1 and owner of the major leagues' lowest earned-run 
average, was knocked out of his last outing in the second inning. Jim Abbott, 
the rookie who regularly pitches to standing ovations, barely lasted four 
innings two nights ago. Chuck Finley, winner of seven of his first nine 
decisions, has lost four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
And Mike Witt? Remember when he was about one more home-run pitch away from 
losing his spot in the rotation, way back around this time last week? 
</P>
<P>
The same Mike Witt was on the mound for the final out at Anaheim Stadium Friday 
night, shutting out the Baltimore Orioles for seven innings and ending a 
four-game Angel losing streak and a seven-game Oriole winning streak with a 5-1 
victory before a crowd of 45,452. 
</P>
<P>
That's two wins in a row for Witt, who presently has the longest streak in the 
Angel rotation. In just two starts, Witt has nearly doubled his victory total 
-- going from 3-7 to 5-7 -- and lowered his earned-run average from 4.93 to 
4.34. 
</P>
<P>
He snapped out of a five-week winless funk last Sunday when he finagled his way 
past the Detroit Tigers for seven innings en route to a rather uneventful 3-1 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's victory was eventful, all right. Witt threw a six-hitter, his first 
complete game since May 13, and came within a bloop double of pitching his 
first shutout of the season. He also made losers of the Orioles for the first 
time in more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Through seven innings, Witt had allowed the Orioles five singles -- two of the 
infield variety -- and let only one baserunner advance as far as third base. In 
the eighth, he yielded a shallow fly ball to .247-hitting Rene Gonzales that 
fell for a double when center fielder Devon White failed to make a diving 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales moved to third base and scored on a pair of ground-outs, with Steve 
Finley's bouncer to shortstop foiling Witt's shutout bid. 
</P>
<P>
The moment was only a minor disappointment for Witt, who began the month 
thankful whenever he pitched a shutout inning. In between his third and fourth 
victories, from May 13 to June 18, Witt had gone 0-4 with a 7.14 ERA in five 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
With Witt, the straits had become so dire, Angel Manager Doug Rader actually 
began broaching the topic of moving Witt, his opening-day starter, to the 
bullpen for a week or so. 
</P>
<P>
Standing at such a crossroads, Witt began examining last resorts and wound up 
trying the once-unthinkable -- redesigning his once-redoubtable curveball, the 
"Mercedes-Bends" of American League repute. 
</P>
<P>
"He changed the grip on his curveball," Rader revealed. "Mike said he thought 
he'd never have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
But desperate times call for desperate measures, and on the Angels' last trip, 
Witt experimented with the new grip, which entails a larger snapping motion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically exaggerating the wrist," Witt said. "I'm 'wrapping' my wrist, 
like (Don) Sutton and (Rick) Sutcliffe did when they threw the curve. The way 
the ball is coming out of my hand and how the batters are seeing it is the way 
it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
New technique, old results. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitch has helped his confidence," Rader said. "There's been a big 
difference in his approach the last couple of times out. With a higher 
confidence level, you can be more aggressive with the way you pitch." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels backed Witt with an eight-hit attack against Dave Schmidt (7-6), 
including home runs by Claudell Washington and Jack Howell, but their most 
interesting piece of work was their first run of the evening, brought to you in 
its entirety by White. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the fourth inning, White bunted back to Schmidt and legged out 
a hit. Then, White stole second. And third. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't stop there. Drawing a hurried throw from catcher Mickey 
Tettleton, White also drew a mistake, with Tettleton's throw sailing down the 
third-base line for an error that enabled White to break a scoreless tie 
standing up. 
</P>
<P>
The stolen bases were White's 24th and 25th. The run was his 42nd. And for 
Tettleton, the error was his first in 98 games, ending an errorless streak of 
219 chances, dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' lead remained 1-0 until Washington's next at-bat. In the sixth 
inning, Washington homered over the right-field fence, his ninth of the season, 
a club high. 
</P>
<P>
And in the seventh inning, the Angels scored three more runs, two on Howell's 
seventh home run. 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing what happens to losing streaks when hitters start hitting home 
runs and pitchers start pitching six-hit complete games. 
</P>
<P>
"Much to their credit, these guys didn't fold their tents," Rader said. "The 
last three weeks could've been very discouraging, but these guys have stuck 
together and worked it out." 
</P>
<P>
And by sticking with Witt, the Angels gave their floundering No. 1 starter the 
chance to work things out. 
</P>
<P>
"Every team in the league knows I've been struggling," Witt said. "But, they 
also know I have the capability to do what I did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
And now, most importantly, the Angels know it, too. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill's rough Tuesday night outing (1 2/3 innings, seven hits, five 
earned runs) was enough to make Angel Manager Doug Rader consider skipping the 
pitcher's next turn. "When I said that, I was just thinking out loud," said 
Rader, who has McCaskill scheduled to pitch Sunday's series finale against the 
Orioles. "Lach (pitching coach Marcel Lachemann) has looked at tapes, and it's 
a mechanical problem. According to Lach and Mac, it's certainly not only 
correctable, but it has been corrected." Rader admitted that his original idea 
was "a little radical. It's more drastic when you give time off to a starter. 
Skip a start and it's 10 days. That's like giving a hitter in a slump 10 days 
off. You'd only do it if there was something physically wrong or if a guy was 
just getting creased and (couldn't) get the job done. But the regular amount of 
time between starts is enough to heal a pitcher emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, they put a punching bag in the runway leading to the Angel dugout in 
order to stem the rash of bruised knuckles resulting from frustrated players 
punching out concrete walls. Now, maybe, they should pad the runway ramp. 
Johnny Ray's sprained toe, which kept him out of the starting lineup for the 
second consecutive night, was incurred when he stubbed it walking back to the 
clubhouse during Tuesday night's 14-inning loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. 
According to Rader, Ray can still bat on the foot but is not yet ready to play 
in the field.

CHEERLEADERS QUIT COWBOYS, SAY NO TO BEER, FRATERNIZATION

More than one-third of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders walked off the squad 
Friday to protest skimpier uniforms, saying they also were asked to act as 
hostesses at parties, fraternize with the team and appear in beer commercials. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Cowboys' new owner, Jerry Jones, calling the 37 cheerleaders "the 
pick of the litter," said that he hasn't changed any rules or policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Those policies are intact," he said. "They are a very valuable and time-tested 
procedure. It seems as though a lot of what was said . . . was speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"Those girls in the past and these girls now are wonderful women." 
</P>
<P>
Jones spoke at a news conference after cheerleader Director Debbie Bond 
resigned, taking all 14 veteran cheerleaders with her. 
</P>
<P>
The 23 rookie members have until Monday to decide whether to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Those who left said they were upset by a proposal to have them dress in halter 
tops and shorts made of body-hugging stretch fabric. 
</P>
<P>
"When (quarterback) Roger Staubach (retired), he went out on top," Bond, 36, 
said. "They have retired. I'm resigning today. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were my daughter, I would not want her to wear that uniform." 
</P>
<P>
But Jones said he has nothing against the current cheerleader uniform of 
shorts, long-sleeved blue shirts tied in the front to leave the midriff bare, a 
fringed bolero-type vest and white boots. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a father," Jones said. "I have a daughter; I know how proud fathers and 
mothers are in the past of their daughters being a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader. 
And I know how proud I want them to be in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Twiggy Isip, 21, a two-year veteran of the squad, said there would be a new 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"And do you know what he wanted? Biker shorts and a halter top," Isip said. "He 
wants us to play hostess at parties and fraternize with the team. We've never 
done that. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is, he wants us to be in beer commercials. We've never even 
been able to have a drink in our hand." 
</P>
<P>
Jones denied asking the cheerleaders to appear in beer commercials. 
</P>
<P>
At issue, he said, is determining how cheerleaders will be punished if they 
break the rules. Under present rules, he said, cheerleaders who drink or 
fraternize with players are summarily fired. 
</P>
<P>
He said he'd prefer to review their behavior in determining what punishment 
would apply. 
</P>
<P>
Bond, who has been with the organization for 10 years, said earlier that she 
had talked with Jones Thursday after hearing that the Arkansas oilman had told 
the players there would be fraternization between the players and cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You can either accept it or move on,"' Bond said. "Mr. Jones does 
not believe in rules." 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboy cheerleaders, who had their first open auditions in the spring of 
'76, set the standards for National Football League cheerleaders, according to 
Bond. 
</P>
<P>
Cheerleaders work for $15 a game, squad founder Suzanne Mitchell said.

Tennessee basketball Coach Wade Houston and son Allan will finally be on the 
same team. 
</P>
<P>
The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. ruled that Allan Houston can enroll at 
Tennessee, play as a freshman and have four years of eligibility, despite 
signing a national letter of intent last fall to play at Louisville, where his 
father was then an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited just to have my family together," Wade Houstonm said. "It means an 
awful lot to his mother and me that Allan wanted to come home and play for his 
dad." 
</P>
<P>
"Finally," said Alice Houston, wife and mother, "after years of separation 
caused by conflicts in basketball schedules, we will be together."

FAN HURT BY RODEO BULL IN BATHROOM MUST BE COMPENSATED, JUDGE RULES

A rodeo group must compensate a woman injured when a bull jumped three fences 
and charged into a bathroom where she was waiting out the competition, a judge 
has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The indoor rodeo arena's 5 1/2-foot-high restraining fences should have been 
higher to contain the bull, even though he "performed a routine that even an 
Olympic steeplechase horse" would have trouble duplicating, said District Judge 
Jon Kerian. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in July 1985. The bull, after throwing its rider and 
chasing a rodeo clown out of the ring, went over the fences and down a hall 
before bursting into the bathroom, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The animal pinned Barbara Deck against a wall, injuring her left shoulder and 
arm, and kicked out a bathroom sink before the woman was rescued by cowboys, 
said her attorney, David Hogue. 
</P>
<P>
Deck, who did not want to watch because she once had seen a bull break the legs 
of its rider, was waiting while her husband watched the bull-riding event, 
Hogue said. 
</P>
<P>
The North Dakota Rodeo Assn. must pay the woman $15,000 plus more than $3,000 
in medical expenses, Kerian ruled after a one-day trial. Kerian also awarded 
Daniel Deck $3,000 for the loss of his wife's services in farm chores.

NEWSWIRE: BOXER ARRESTED ON COCAINE CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Guthrie, who was kept from competing for a spot on the U.S. Olympic 
boxing team last summer because he failed a drug test, was arrested in St. 
Louis on a cocaine charge Thursday, a day after he had won his second 
professional bout. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie, 22, was being held on a charge of possession of cocaine with intent to 
distribute. 
</P>
<P>
A St. Louis police detective said in an affidavit accompanying the federal 
complaint that he had been told by an informer that Guthrie would sell cocaine 
to the informer. The informer arranged to buy four ounces of cocaine from 
Guthrie June 15 on a St. Louis street corner. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, police staked out the intersection and converged on 
Guthrie after he arrived. After the boxer ran toward a telephone and dropped a 
carrying case onto a parking lot, officers spotted a bag containing four ounces 
of cocaine. Police also said they found two packets of cocaine in the boxer's 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents didn't explain why Guthrie was able to box Wednesday.

Memphis State officials met with the NCAA Committee on Infractions in Kansas 
City to discuss allegations made against the Tiger football program. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing came nearly four months after the university received an inquiry 
from the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
In its inquiry, the NCAA alleged: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Memphis State lineman James Macklin was paid excessively by booster Mark 
Benskin for work done in the summer of 1988. Macklin was allegedly paid about 
$10 an hour for running errands for Mark Benskin &amp; Co. while others 
performing similar duties were paid about $5 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Memphis State running back Xavier Crawford provided false and misleading 
information concerning his conduct with and relationship to Marc Kaleta of 
Memphis, whom the NCAA said accompanied Crawford on a recruiting visit to the 
University of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The infractions committee will meet over the weekend to rule on the case, but 
Beebe said the outcome won't be announced for at least two weeks.

SUPER DERBY TO OFFER $2 MILLION IF SUNDAY SILENCE, EASY GOER RUN

<P>
The Super Derby, which doubled its purse from $500,000 to $1 million two years 
ago, will offer $2 million if Sunday Silence and Easy Goer enter the Sept. 24 
race, Louisiana Downs owner Edward J. DeBartolo said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness but was deprived of the 
Triple Crown when Easy Goer won the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"For this Super Derby, we're adding a million dollars to the pot, and it will 
be a $2-million race . . . because we are reasonably certain that we're going 
to get Easy Goer and Sunday Silence," DeBartolo said. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, DeBartolo said, $1.2 million of the $2-million purse would be 
paid to the winner of Super Derby X, $400,000 to the runner-up, $220,000 to the 
third-place finisher, $120,000 to the fourth-place finisher and $60,000 to the 
fifth horse. 
</P>
<P>
The payoffs would be cut in half if neither horse starts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Charlie Whittingham and Shug McGaughey, respective trainers of Sunday 
Silence and Easy Goer, were noncommittal but expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I was planning to come to the Louisiana race if it fits along in our program 
as we go along," Whittingham said in a conference call. "It's on my schedule." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the same way," said McGaughey, who won last year's Super Derby with 
Seeking the Gold. "It's definitely one of our plans. Right now we're going to 
try to get to the (Aug. 19) Travers the best way that we can. When we come out 
of the Travers, then we'll try to make up our schedule to get us hopefully to 
the Breeders Cup."

A 24-year-old jockey has received a 10-year suspension after admitting he tried 
to bribe another jockey $1,000 to lose a race at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling against Doug Schrick was issued by the board of stewards Thursday, 
following a lengthy investigation. The other jockey and the date in question 
were not identified, but the board said the incident occurred about a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Schrick's whereabouts are not known. The stewards said further charges could be 
filed, since it is both a state and federal crime to attempt to affect the 
outcome of a sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
"Schrick admitted to us that he offered another jockey a bribe and claimed that 
he was a go-between for another party," steward Leon Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was contacted by the other party to bribe the jockey to lose. The idea was 
the other party would claim the horse that day, step him up off the bad race to 
try and win a bet." 
</P>
<P>
Steward Charles Dougherty said Schrick telephone the jockeys' room and was 
twice turned down by the other rider, then was rejected when he went there in 
person. 
</P>
<P>
Schrick launched his riding career in the Pacific Northwest, winning his first 
race at Yakima Meadows in October 1981. He was the fifth-leading jockey at 
Longacres with 65 winners in 1984 and has ridden in Northern California off and 
on since then.

HOLLAND, ONE HOPES, QUIT BECAUSE IT WAS TIME FOR A GROWN-UP'S JOB

<P>
Let's hope his health had nothing to do with it. Let's hope Terry Holland 
simply decided to quit coaching college basketball because, at age 47, it was 
time to take a grown-up's job. 
</P>
<P>
Not that running an athletic department, as Holland will be doing as of next 
May, is any feet-on-the-desk, nine-to-noon snap. And especially at Davidson, 
which has not seemed to know where it was headed since Holland left 15 years 
ago for Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Holland and Virginia made an ideal match that proved more successful than 
either surely imagined at the start. The Cavaliers wanted a classy coach who 
would make them consistently competitive in the Atlantic Coast Conference; 
Holland twice took them all the way to the Final Four -- and within a game of 
that grail again last season. 
</P>
<P>
Holland on the court, during five seasons at Davidson and 15 at Virginia, was 
not as he seemed off it. Away from games, Holland affected the air of a 
personable professor in dignified academia by day. By night, he was in deep 
thought by a fire, drawing on a pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Tipoffs transformed his personality, from serenity to vein-popping anger. He 
called his dog Dean Smith, because it whined so much, but nobody could pout 
quite like Holland in a huff. 
</P>
<P>
Holland seemed above the knee-bending swirl that goes with coaxing teen-agers 
to play games for profit. Yet, he was crafty enough to once hire as an 
assistant the coach of a couple of high school hotshots from Kentucky. He was 
lucky enough to have Ralph Sampson born fairly close to the doorstep of 
Virginia's gym. 
</P>
<P>
The reputation Holland carries around the game is that of not quite getting the 
most from teams with exceptional talent but squeezing more than seems possible 
from teams with ordinary players. On balance, his averaging 20 victories over 
20 seasons at schools that demand serious scholarship is remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
Last season ran the gamut for Holland. He endured his second intestinal 
operation, which kept him from the team for six games. He came back and took 
the Cavaliers to the final of the NCAA's Mideast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
The two games in the regional were as satisfying and frustrating as coaching 
gets. In the first, Virginia was smarter, tougher and more patient than an 
Oklahoma team with two all-Americans. In the second, the Cavaliers were 
embarrassed by a Michigan team on a lights-out shooting binge. 
</P>
<P>
Holland also was close-up witness to a coach whose good fortune was as none 
ever, Michigan's Steve Fisher. Here was Holland, who had paid most of the dues 
possible in an unforgiving profession, who had sacrificed and suffered and 
never quite been fully satisfied, beaten by an assistant with a battlefield 
promotion, whose first six games as a head coach would bring the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
So, yet another coach who has pushed North Carolina's Smith, but not caught 
him, leaves the Atlantic Coast Conference. Holland did scare the league's 
all-time coach a few times, most notably with Sampson in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
With such as James Worthy, Sam Perkins and Michael Jordan, North Carolina 
usually had the superior team. Because Smith elevated Sampson to such a 
rarefied level -- "his only point of reference will be himself" -- and played 
stallball during the second half of the 1982 ACC title game, Tar Heel success 
at the time seemed greater than it does in retrospect. 
</P>
<P>
Holland's leaving is the latest coaching change in a league generally stable 
the last several seasons. Bob Staak was replaced by Holland aide Dave Odom at 
Wake Forest. Bob Wade was replaced by Gary Williams at Maryland. Still 
whispered is North Carolina State Coach Jim Valvano beating it to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
If leaving had been on Holland's mind for some time, would Odom have gone to 
Wake Forest? Possibly, because a new arena and some fine players were there. 
Before a disastrous experience at Rutgers, assistant Craig Littlepage would 
have been a logical successor to Holland. No longer. 
</P>
<P>
Under Holland, Virginia has become a job much coveted. Like Smith for nearly 30 
years at North Carolina and Mike Krzyzewski for nearly 10 at Duke, Holland has 
shown that an academically minded school that bends its admissions rules now 
and then -- but not too far -- can succeed in megabucks basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson slipped, and in a hurry, after Holland left. One of Lefty Driesell's 
early recruits at Davidson, Holland assumed control of the program not long 
after Driesell became coach at Maryland -- and was 92-43 in five years. 
</P>
<P>
After Holland, Davidson was noted for future-famous coaches (Bobby Knight and 
Larry Brown) declining the job. 
</P>
<P>
Holland's skills as an administrator of more athletic teams than his own are 
unknown. Still, he brings to his old school and his native state a sense of 
order and promise. Not just any challenge would stop him from chasing Dean.

METHANOL FOR ALL?; 
</P>
<P>
'CLEANER' FUEL MAY BE COMING INTO ITS OWN TO HELP BANISH SMOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer

<P>
Meredith Lanz says he nearly "jumped for joy" two weeks ago when he saw 
President Bush on television promoting the use of methanol to fuel cars as one 
way to clean up the nation's air. 
</P>
<P>
Lanz drives an unexceptional-looking 1983 Ford Escort that runs only on 
methanol, an odorless, colorless liquid made from natural gas or coal. 
Widespread use of this "cleaner" fuel, state and federal officials say, could 
reduce smog levels in Southern California by up to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe now I'll be able to find more fuel pumps," Lanz said. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual fuel has boosted acceleration and posed no mechanical problems, 
said Lanz, who works for Anaheim's municipal electric utility. But methanol is 
scarce, and at 11 miles per gallon, Lanz needs a lot of it. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, one of the county's first commercial methanol pumps will open for 
business at a Chevron station at the corner of Harbor Boulevard and Katella 
Avenue in Anaheim. Although the station is already supplying methanol under 
contract to Anaheim for its Escorts, the Bush Administration's interest in 
methanol has caused the California Energy Commission to choose the station as 
the site for a press conference to be attended by the chief of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and other 
dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
The county's only other methanol pump is at an Arco station used by the cities 
of Orange and Santa Ana, at the corner of Main Street and MacArthur Boulevard 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lanz is a strong advocate of using methanol to help reduce air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
But John Heeks, a city of Orange building inspector, won't go near the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Heeks' city-owned, 1983 Ford Escort had stalled on State College Boulevard last 
Aug. 1, and he had just radioed his dispatcher for help when the car burst into 
flames. Methanol had eaten through a rubber fuel line and spilled onto the 
Escort's hot engine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky to get out alive," Heeks said of the fire. "I will never drive a 
methanol car ever again, if I can help it." 
</P>
<P>
The methanol-powered, 1983 Escorts driven by Lanz and Heeks are two out of a 
total of a dozen used experimentally as fleet vehicles by the cities of Orange, 
Anaheim and Santa Ana. So far, experts say, the cars, which cannot run on 
anything but methanol, have performed well mechanically and are no more 
dangerous than gasoline-powered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fuel costs less than gasoline -- usually 69 to 93 cents per gallon 
-- the low mileage for methanol means that fuel costs are actually higher. The 
reason for the low mileage is that methanol burns cooler than gasoline, 
reducing the fuel's efficiency as a heat source in the combustion process. One 
result, however, is about a 7% improvement in horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
Reliability is about the same as for a gasoline-powered car, although stainless 
steel parts have had to be substituted in the carburetors and other fuel-system 
components to prevent corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the next generation of methanol-fueled vehicles, which can also run on 
gasoline, is about to arrive, each costing $200 to $500 more than a 
gasoline-only vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who sits on the board of the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District, Orange County government is 
negotiating for two of these new variable-fuel Ford Crown Victoria sedans under 
a state-run program, and Santa Ana is attempting to get three. Other local 
government agencies are expected to share in a fleet of more than 2,000 
variable-fuel Chevy Luminas, Corsicas and Ford Crown Victorias that are to 
arrive in California during the next few months as part of the state's effort 
to promote increased production of the vehicles by automakers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said there were 300 requests for the first batch of 200 new 
variable-fuel cars delivered to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sudden influx of new vehicles, methanol cars will be experimental 
for the next few years -- sold to government agencies and not to the public. 
The Orange County Transit District will soon have three buses testing a variety 
of alternate fuels -- methanol, compressed natural gas and propane. Until 
recently, propane has been dominant as a cleaner alternative to gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD, for example, already operates its 135 dial-a-ride vans on propane, and 
some private companies, such as The Times, have long used propane in delivery 
trucks. But state officials say propane is a "dirtier" fuel than methanol and 
thus enthusiasm for it is not as high. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol can be made from coal or natural gas and produces engine exhaust that 
creates 50% less ozone -- a key ingredient in smog -- than gasoline, according 
to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest negative -- and it's a big one -- is the lack of pumps," says Lanz 
of Anaheim's electric utility. 
</P>
<P>
Once after he ran out of fuel, towed the car to the pump and refilled it, Lanz 
recalls, he couldn't restart the engine until "a young kid came by and said, 
'Hey, is that methanol? You have to prime the carburetor.' We might still be 
standing there if that guy hadn't said anything. I don't know who he was, or 
how he knew. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't dare take it very far away," Lanz says. "I don't even like to take it 
into Los Angeles, because if you start out without a full tank and hit any kind 
of traffic jam, you could be in a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The fuel-availability problem may be nearing a partial solution. Under recent 
agreements with the state, several oil companies plan to open methanol pumps in 
the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the idea of using methanol," Lanz says, "because I'm interested in 
anything that will help make the air more breathable. I grew up in this area, 
and I can see the way it's gotten worse. I can see the difference from 30 or 40 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT IS METHANOL? 
</P>
<P>
* It's a colorless, odorless, volatile and flammable liquid that is pumped like 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
* Can be made from natural gas, coal, wood or any decomposing biological mass. 
It also can be synthesized from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. 
</P>
<P>
* It produces about 50% less ozone -- a key component of smog -- than gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
* It already is used in antifreeze, solvents and in the manufacture of 
formaldehyde, powders and paint.

GOLDSTEIN ELECTED AS PRESIDING JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein was elected by his 55 
colleagues Friday to the post of presiding judge of the court. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein, first appointed to Superior Court in 1977 by then-Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr., will assume his new duties in in January. He defeated Judge James L. 
Smith to gain the prestigious position. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a heavy responsibility to head the third largest court in the state, but 
I'm looking forward to it," Goldstein said. He cited as his top priority the 
need to get state approval to add more judges to head off a growing backlog of 
cases in the court system. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein, who has concentrated of late on civil litigation, came to the court 
amid some controversy. He traveled the unusual route of being elevated by Brown 
from the Municipal Court to Superior Court in 1977, then losing his position in 
a 1978 election and being reappointed by Brown to the Superior Court in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
His initial appointment to the Municipal Court also drew some skepticism from 
local attorneys who questioned the appointment of Goldstein, then of North 
Hollywood, to a local post.

MAN GUILTY IN DEATH OF MOTHER OF 6; 
</P>
<P>
2 JURORS HOLD OUT SUCCESSFULLY FOR A 2ND-DEGREE VERDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man was found guilty of second-degree murder Friday in the death of 
a young mother of three sets of twins, but many of the jurors said later that 
they let him off too easy. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said afterward that 10 of them felt to the very end that 29-year-old 
Roger Max Keller was guilty of first-degree murder for the Nov. 14, 1987, 
strangulation death of Lisa Maria Guardiola of Anaheim. Her body was found by a 
jogger early that morning near the Chapman Road entrance to Irvine Regional 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
But the jurors said they finally agreed to the lesser verdict when it was clear 
that at least one and possibly two of them would not budge from a second-degree 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"We read the judge's instruction that it was OK to compromise if we at least 
all agreed he was guilty of murder," said Walter B. Johnson of Anaheim, one of 
the jurors who supported a first-degree verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the majority finally agreed that a second-degree verdict was 
better than a mistrial. The deliberations, which began Wednesday, had taken 
several turns. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, all 12 agreed on second-degree murder but decided to sleep on it. 
On Thursday, the majority said they really supported a first-degree verdict and 
told Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey that afternoon that they were 
deadlocked. But he sent them back Friday to try again. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise turned out to please both Keller's attorney and the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jill W. Roberts lost her best evidence when Dickey ruled 
that Keller's confession to the killing had not been voluntary. Keller at first 
had refused to talk to Orange County Sheriff's Department investigators after 
his arrest in Houston, nearly two weeks after the killing. Then, in an 
about-face, he decided to confess. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Roberts was so relieved to hear that Keller was found guilty of at 
least some type of murder that she was red-faced with tears as she hugged 
several of the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to be happy with this," she said. "I've got enough confidence in our 
parole system to believe that he's going to be put away from a long time." 
</P>
<P>
A first-degree murder verdict, which includes premeditation by a defendant, 
carries a standard sentence of 25 years to life in prison; second degree is 15 
years to life. While most of those convicted of second-degree murder serve no 
more than half the minimum, the parole board does have some discretion to 
lengthen the term, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Keller's attorney, Paul G. Stark, was also relieved after he heard from jurors 
how close his client had come to a first-degree murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't complain," Stark said. "Although I would have preferred a not 
guilty, second-degree (murder) was certainly within the realm of the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Also in tears and exchanging hugs with jurors was Lu Rutters of Santa Maria, 
mother of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long 18 months," she said. "After the confession was thrown out, I 
was pleased it was at least second-degree murder." 
</P>
<P>
The question only partially answered is why Keller killed the young mother. 
</P>
<P>
Keller was an acquaintance of the victim's husband, Alfredo Guardiola. Lisa 
Guardiola had been out with a friend and returned home about 1 a.m. the morning 
she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
An argument broke out between the husband and wife, with Keller present. Keller 
later said he killed her on orders from her husband, but prosecutors say that 
at the very most, Keller only "read too much into" the husband's angry 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will ever really know what he (Keller) was thinking when he 
killed her," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Without the confession, Keller was connected to the crime through trace 
evidence -- fibers from his car's carpet were found on her shoes, and a pigment 
Keller used in his job as a color-mixer were found on her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Keller was the last one seen with the woman before her death. Jury 
foreman Samuel B. Adams of Fountain Valley called that the key factor in 
deciding Keller was guilty. But Adams was one of the holdouts for a 
second-degree verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"I just did not think that premeditation had been proven by the evidence," 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams left alone while other jurors remained to talk with the lawyers. Many of 
them said that Adams was the most adamant of the two who supported second 
degree. Alfredo Guardiola has since taken the twins, all 5 years old and under 
at the time of the killing, to his native Colombia.

REFUGEE MAY FACE PRISON; JUDGE CHASTISES HIS LAWYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge said Friday that he may send a local Vietnamese refugee 
to state prison for his involvement in a political assassination attempt. And, 
in a fierce reprimand, the judge lambasted the defendant's attorney for having 
publicly suggested otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Be Tu Van Tran, 33, who admitted having shot a fellow refugee for expressing 
views that Tran interpreted as being pro-Communist, must now be committed to 
the state probation system for a 90-day examination to determine whether he 
poses any continuing danger to society. 
</P>
<P>
In putting off Tran's sentencing until that analysis is completed, Judge Robert 
R. Fitzgerald lashed out at defense attorney Robert Weinberg of Irvine for his 
public comments on Tran's fate. 
</P>
<P>
After Tran entered what amounted to a guilty plea last month, the lawyer told 
reporters that he was confident from his discussions with the judge that his 
client would have to spend only a few months of incarceration, rather than the 
nine years he could face for an attempted-murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
In court Friday, Fitzgerald called Weinberg's quoted comments a "gross error" 
and said he was "appalled" that the lawyer would prejudge the case by 
disclosing confidential in-chamber proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Asserting that he has made no promises, Fitzgerald underscored the severity of 
Tran's plea by warning that the case "may end up in substantial prison time." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the hearing, Weinberg expressed regret over the comments 
that sparked Fitzgerald's reprimand, saying: "I've done myself and my client a 
terrible disservice." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg added: "I can understand why (Fitzgerald) got so upset at me. . . . My 
intuition should have been kept to myself." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual reprimand by Fitzgerald was yet another twist in an emotionally 
charged case that began in 1986, when Westminster businessman Tran Khanh Van 
suggested in a Los Angeles Times Magazine article that the United States 
normalize relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after those comments appeared, Van was shot twice in an attack outside 
his Westminster real estate office. Be Tu Van Tran admitted in a disputed 
statement to police that he shot Van because he was infuriated by what he saw 
as the fellow refugee's sympathies toward the Communist regime in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Tran's defense team has tried to show that the one-time English teacher in 
Vietnam, who left his entire family behind in the war-torn region, did not 
actually shoot Van but took responsibility for the crime only as a "badge of 
honor" in the fight against communism. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a jury in the case could not reach a verdict in a trial that drew the 
attention of members of the Vietnamese community, many of whom saw Tran as a 
hero for his stand against communism. A second trial that was to have begun 
last month was averted when Tran effectively admitted guilt in what is known as 
a "slow plea." 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks from the bench Friday, Judge Fitzgerald said he would wait to 
see the evaluation of state probation personnel before deciding on an 
appropriate sentence for Tran. 
</P>
<P>
But in assessing the case, the judge did assert that every citizen "has a right 
to be free from fear" of reprisals for expressing controversial views. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans went further in urging that Tran be 
sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed with the court, the prosecutor called the assassination attempt 
"the prototype nightmare of a free-world society. In short, Van Khan Tran was 
gunned down because of what people thought he believed."

TENTATIVE SCHOOL PACT REACHED IN SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana Unified School District and its 1,800 teachers have quietly 
reached a tentative three-year contract settlement that offers a 7% pay 
increase for 1989-90, and promises raises that are 1% above those of other 
local unified school districts for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement comes after four months of negotiations behind closed doors, 
without public rancor or controversy. It was markedly different from last year, 
when teachers voted to strike -- although they never followed through with the 
threatened action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spirit of Cooperation' 
</P>
<P>
"It's because of the increasing spirit of cooperation between everyone -- the 
school board, the administration, the certified staff and classified staff," 
said Rick Bryan, president of the Santa Ana Educators Assn. "Everyone is . . . 
recognizing that the only way we can get anywhere is with everyone working 
together." 
</P>
<P>
During the district's contract talks last year, teachers staged two sickouts. 
Even after a tentative settlement was reached, teachers picketed, some of them 
carrying signs that said "Santa Ana Supports Mediocrity in Education." But this 
year was different. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a true collaborative effort on the part of both teams," Supt. Rudy 
Castruita said. "There was an extraordinary amount of cooperation which led to 
this early settlement, and now gives us the chance to focus on the business of 
educating children." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations in the Santa Ana district were also in marked contrast to the 
lengthy contract dispute at the Anaheim Union High School District, which 
culminated in a one-day strike May 10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Teachers Vote 
</P>
<P>
After months of working without a contract, and several bitter negotiating 
sessions, Anaheim teachers this week voted to ratify a contract that will give 
them a 1% pay increase for the school year that just ended. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Unified spokeswoman Diane Thomas said the pay increases for the last 
two years of the contract will be calculated by averaging the pay increases of 
the other 11 unified school districts in the county, and then adding 1%. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative settlement also includes, she said, a 1.7% equivalency in fringe 
benefits, meaning that the district will absorb increased benefit costs next 
year instead of passing them on to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trustees will vote on the package at its meeting Tuesday, Thomas 
said, adding that ballots for ratification will be mailed to teachers that same 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the agreement to keep Santa Ana teacher salaries on a par with that 
of other Orange County unified districts means the district can compete for the 
same quality teachers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At County Average 
</P>
<P>
"We're right at the county average now, but we are the largest district in the 
county and the board is committed to putting us ahead," she said. "It will 
enhance our recruitment efforts, our effort to keep teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's very pleased about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the package will cost the district $4.5 million the first year. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan said the difference in this year's negotiations, compared to those last 
year, partially have to do with new leadership at the school district. 
Castruita, who was named superintendent of schools in November, has brought a 
number of changes to the district. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a dynamic new superintendent -- I'm sure that's one of the factors," 
Bryan said. "But it's the sense of good feeling and good cooperation among 
everyone that was also responsible. It's just wonderful to work in a district 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Change Image 
</P>
<P>
He also said that granting such a large pay increase and making a commitment to 
keep it competitive with other nearby districts will go a long way toward 
changing the negative image that has long plagued Santa Ana's schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we're definitely changing our image to a much more positive one," he said. 
"It's frustrating sometimes for all of us, because we know about the changes 
internally that everyone else on the outside doesn't recognize. But hopefully 
this will get the word out to those in the community and others not in the 
district."

2 SUSPECTS CAUGHT AFTER CHASE IN, OUT OF COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two escaped convicts from Michigan led law enforcement officers on a 220-mile 
chase from Bakersfield through Orange County to San Pedro before their car, 
reportedly stolen, ran out of gas Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Kaser, 22, of Michigan and Kevin Killingsworth, 29, of Virginia 
were captured after the 3-hour chase ended about 3 a.m., said Rick Odom, a CHP 
spokesman in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
It all began just before midnight when authorities received a call that a black 
Cadillac had been stolen from a man as he was filling his tank at a service 
station on Interstate 5, about 20 miles from Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threw Debris at Officers 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers spotted the Cadillac about 12:10 a.m. and tried to pull it over, 
but after the patrol car slowed down to 15 m.p.h., "the (suspects') vehicle 
accelerated away and the passenger stood up through the sun roof and began to 
throw bottles and debris at the officers," Odom said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects then drove south on Interstate 5 at speeds of up to 120 m.p.h., 
with three CHP cars and a Kern County Sheriff's Department helicopter in 
pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
At the Grapevine area of Interstate 5, the Ft. Tejon office of the CHP took up 
the chase, which continued into Los Angeles and Orange counties. CHP officers 
joined the pursuit at various points. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers that work each area are more familiar with those freeways, 
on-ramps and surface streets, and can handle a high-speed chase with more 
safety," Odom explained. 
</P>
<P>
Jurisdictions that assisted were Newhall, West Valley, Verdugo Hills, Central 
and East Los Angeles, Santa Fe Springs, Santa Ana and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
As the pursuit turned north from Interstate 5 onto Coast Highway, police 
departments in Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Signal Hill, Long 
Beach and Los Angeles took turns pursuing the two suspects, Odom said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Movie Chase 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a Hollywood movie where you can catch up to the vehicle, tap the 
bumper and have the suspects pull over safely," Los Angeles Police Lt. Richard 
Gonzales said. Trying to force the suspects to pull over could "endanger not 
only the suspects and officers, but innocent citizens and pedestrians," 
Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects finally stopped at Grand Avenue and 14th Street in San Pedro. They 
were taken back to Bakersfield where they were booked for vehicle theft, 
possession of stolen property, assault with a deadly weapon (throwing the 
bottles) and evading arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Kaser and Killingsworth were being held in the Kern County Jail.

LOW-KEY APPROACH; 
</P>
<P>
GEORGE YARDLEY DOWNPLAYED HIS SUCCESS WHILE LEADING A FAMILY OF REAL SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While they were growing up, Marilyn, Rob, Rich and Anne Yardley had no idea 
that their father, George Yardley, once had been a basketball superstar. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there had been clues -- big basketball trophies in the den, pictures on 
the wall, people recognizing their father in restaurants -- but it took the 
Yardley children many years before they realized that the name George Harry 
Yardley III meant something more, to other people at least, than just dear ol' 
dad. 
</P>
<P>
"He never ever talked about his basketball days," Rich Yardley said. "We didn't 
even really realize he had been a pro athlete until eighth grade or so when 
some kid told us. 
</P>
<P>
"When people came up to him in restaurants we figured something was going on. 
But we didn't understand why he was famous. We'd say, 'Wow, is it because he's 
bald?' " 
</P>
<P>
Actually, George Yardley gained fame in the late 1950s with a nifty jump shot 
(he was one of the first to perfect it), tremendous leaping ability (he was one 
of the first to dunk), and by becoming the first player in National Basketball 
Assn. history to score more than 2,000 points -- he scored 2,001 -- in a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He topped 2,000 points playing for the Detroit Pistons in the last game of the 
1957-58 season. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Yardley, now 60, points out, that was more than 30 years ago. The past 
has passed and the present and future are certainly more significant to him, as 
his family and manufacturing business have long taken top priority. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Yardleys -- George, his twin sons, Rob and Rich, his daughter, Anne, 
his brother, Bob, and Bob's son, Bill -- represent one of Orange County's many 
sporting families. 
</P>
<P>
And although George Yardley is by the far the center of the family's athletic 
success, he has plenty of talented company: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rob Yardley, 32, played basketball at Orange Coast College and at Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rich Yardley, Rob's twin, played volleyball at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anne Yardley, now Anne Yardley Caldwell, was a high school All-American in 
volleyball at Newport Harbor High School, and went on to a successful 
collegiate career at Texas A&amp;M and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bob Yardley, 57, played basketball at Colorado after a standout season at 
Orange Coast (where during the 1950-51 season he averaged 20.3 points a game). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Yardley, 27, was a three-year captain and a three-year All-American in 
volleyball at USC. From 1985-86, he played on the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Yardley is the only one of the bunch still competing. His club volleyball 
team finished fourth at the U.S. Volleyball Assn. national championships two 
weeks ago, and he was named a USVBA All-American. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of the Yardley clan, however, talk of sports has been reduced to 
common chit-chat. 
</P>
<P>
But when they get together in the family's Newport Beach home, which sits atop 
a bluff overlooking Newport's Upper Back Bay, the memories flow like a 
high-arching swish. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't make a good girls' team today," George Yardley said. "I mean it. 
Our play then was about at the level that the girls play in college today." 
</P>
<P>
Although many would have vast disagreements with Yardley's assessment, Yardley 
himself is not one to boast about his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he considers the 2,001-point season as one of his two high 
points in basketball -- the other was winning the Amateur Athletic Union 
national title in 1951 with San Francisco Stewart-Chevrolet -- Yardley does not 
go out of his way to talk about his athletic exploits. 
</P>
<P>
"The only real concern I ever really had was someday I would have to grow up 
and be a man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is a hint why when Yardley became a father, he in no way pushed 
any of his children toward basketball, or any sport for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rich: "If anything, the pressure was the other direction. He never 
encouraged us. . . . Most dads would at least play catch with their kids, but 
he never encouraged us one way or the other. Maybe that sounds bad, but I'm not 
disappointed at all. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of fathers try to live vicariously though their children. Dad didn't 
have to live vicariously. He'd already lived it." 
</P>
<P>
He certainly had. 
</P>
<P>
Yardley, a late bloomer who didn't begin to reach his potential until after he 
had graduated from Stanford, was the first-round draft choice of the then-Fort 
Wayne (Ind.) Pistons in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
But because he wanted to play on the 1952 Olympic team, Yardley turned down the 
offers to go pro, playing with AAU teams instead. But after breaking his wrist, 
his Olympic hopes were dashed. Yardley said that was the low point of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very disappointing," he said. "I was the best player in basketball at 
the time, I had been an MVP (in the AAU) league for the last two years. It 
wasn't good." 
</P>
<P>
He turned pro in 1953, and played for the Pistons until 1959 when he was traded 
to the Syracuse Nationals. After 1 1/2 years with Syracuse, Yardley quit for a 
year to start his business in California. In 1961, the Los Angeles Jets, an 
American Basketball League team, agreed to pay Yardley $500 a game. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news was I only had to play home games," Yardley said. "The bad news 
was that the checks all bounced." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Yardley retired from pro ball for good. Although he often missed the 
competition and the camaraderie, neither he nor his wife, Diana, missed the 
travel, especially the long journey back to California after the season ended 
each spring. 
</P>
<P>
Especially horrendous was the journey home in 1957. Driving through Texas, the 
Yardleys were hit by a blizzard. The only motel in the nearest town of Shamrock 
was full. They drove through 20-foot high snowdrifts until they reached a 
farmhouse. The owner let the family stay in the garage, which had two large 
broken windows. Inside, a bum was passed out with a whiskey bottle by his side. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awful," Diana Yardley said. "George had to go out and find milk for the 
babies. I was left with this bum, and a tornado came and we thought, 'Well, 
that's the end of us.' " 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the Yardleys learned that 17 people, stranded in their cars, died 
that night of exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Yardley's children were too young to remember any of this, of course. And of 
their father's professional career, they can only remember a few flashes. 
Though nothing of the games themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember eating popcorn on the floor of some arena or something," Marilyn 
Yardley said. "I remember riding on his shoulders going down the halls into a 
locker room, I guess. But I don't think I connected it with anything like 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, about 10 years after his retirement, George Yardley did make an 
effort to show his children he could play the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I had to be a father and let them see me play," he said. "So I took 
them to a game I was playing in, in a local league." 
</P>
<P>
While the team warmed up inside the gym before the game, the Yardley children 
went outside to shoot some baskets. Moments later, they heard a whistle. They 
ran in, thinking the game was about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, not only had they missed the opening tipoff, but the whistle 
they had heard was one signaling a double technical foul on their father. 
Yardley had kicked the basketball into the gym's rafters, and there the ball 
had stuck. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball stuck, so the official threw me out of the game," Yardley said. "So 
we went home. 
</P>
<P>
"And that was their indoctrination into the game."

WHITE'S STEALS SET THE PACE FOR ANGELS' VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are baseball players who create a lot of runs by simply hitting baseballs 
over stadium fences. This is called the direct method. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are players such as Devon White, who hits balls out of stadiums, but 
also manufactures runs with bunts, brash and brute athletic prowess. It takes 
time; creating anything usually does. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth inning when White came to the plate against Baltimore Orioles 
starter Dave Schmidt. Neither team had scored, the Angels were riding a 
four-game losing streak, White had just eight hits in his last 53 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
So he dropped a bunt down the third-base side. Schmidt, well aware of White's 
speed, frantically made his way to the ball but in his haste he forgot to pick 
it up. White stood at first with an infield single. 
</P>
<P>
With Wally Joyner at the plate, White took off to steal second. The Orioles, 
though, had thought of this and pitched out. Still, catcher Mickey's 
Tettleton's throw couldn't beat White to the bag. Joyner flied out to center. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing came to the plate. White took off for third. Tettleton threw 
again, this time high and over the head of Baltimore third baseman Rene 
Gonzales. White trotted home with the first run of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The steals were his 24th and 25th of the season. His dash to third and then 
home didn't come a moment too soon. Downing flied to center to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"That (White's run) was a big play for us," said Doug Rader, Angels manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels went on to win, 5-1, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on his fourth-inning odyssey, White simply shrugged and said: 
"Well, every now and then I get on base and those things happen." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents view White in far less casual terms. Witness Schmidt's bobble of 
White's bunt, or the fact that Tettleton's hurried throw was his first error in 
98 games. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, it was a good night for White and his outfield mates Chili Davis and 
Claudell Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Davis went two for three. Washington hit a solo homer leading off the sixth 
inning. It was his ninth this season, which leads the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
But it is White who is the most creative, dangerous, enjoyable and perhaps 
gifted outfielder the Angels have or have ever had. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his recent slump, White was planning to bunt in the fourth the whole 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't care if the third baseman played up or not," he said. "I haven't been 
getting on base much. My purpose that time was to get to third with less than 
two outs. I'm just trying to make something happen. I haven't been hitting very 
well, so I'm trying to work my way through it." 
</P>
<P>
Rather humble words from a significant talent. Though White did let his guard 
down for a second. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big part of my game," he said. "If they make the mistake of letting 
me get to base, I'm going to terrorize them for it."

KHARI JOHNSON HOPES TO FIND TEAM SUCCESS AT IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There were times, Khari Johnson admits, when he just went through the motions. 
There were even times when he couldn't wait for his senior season to end. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't supposed to be this way. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro High School was among the top 10 teams in Orange County in most 1988-89 
preseason basketball polls. Johnson, an honorable mention preseason 
All-American in Street &amp; Smith's magazine, was returning for his third 
season with great expectations. 
</P>
<P>
But somewhere between two opening victories and a one-game playoff appearance, 
El Toro's promising season never materialized. El Toro sputtered to a 13-13 
record that left a lot of unanswered questions. 
</P>
<P>
How did El Toro beat Dominguez and Trabuco Hills, Southern Section champions in 
the 4-A and 3-A divisions, and lose to San Clemente, which won only four games 
all season? 
</P>
<P>
Why was Johnson, a strapping 6-foot-6, 190-pound senior, so inconsistent in a 
game that he could seemingly dominate? 
</P>
<P>
Or, simply put, what was wrong with El Toro, and more specifically, Johnson, 
during the 1988-89 season? 
</P>
<P>
Tim Travers, El Toro's coach, doesn't have a specific answer. He points out 
that 12 of El Toro's 13 losses came against teams that qualified for the 
playoffs and that five of those losses came against teams that advanced to 
championship games in their respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We were 13 points away from being 18-8, and I think that was part of Khari's 
frustration," Travers said. "He wanted to win his senior year, and it didn't 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson watched his close friends, Craig Marshall and Malru Dottin of 
Saddleback High, advance to the 5-AA division championship game while El Toro 
was eliminated in the opening round of the playoffs as an at-large entry. El 
Toro had finished fifth in the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
"The team had a lot of problems," Johnson said. "There was a lot of selfishness 
on the team. We had a lot of good individuals who never jelled as a team. Coach 
Travers tried everything. 
</P>
<P>
"We had team meetings, team meals . . . nothing seemed to work. I never thought 
about quitting, because I love the game. But I couldn't wait for the season to 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson averaged 15.7 points and 9.7 rebounds as a senior forward. He set a 
school record with 23 rebounds in his final high school game against Los 
Alamitos. But numbers couldn't hide his disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where I wasn't putting in the effort I should have," he 
said. "The low point of the season was losing to San Clemente. We were never 
the same after that." 
</P>
<P>
Critics pointed the finger at Johnson for El Toro's mediocre season. He was 
labeled a "one-dimensional player" who was inconsistent and put forth a maximum 
effort only when attempting one of his crowd-pleasing dunks. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson rarely took an outside shot. Few wondered if he even had an outside 
shot. He usually posted up and waited for a pass to come inside. Problem was, 
the pass seldom came. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I saw him play, no one would pass him the ball," said Bill 
Mulligan, UC Irvine coach. "Here was this player with all the talent in the 
world and he never got the ball." 
</P>
<P>
There were games in which the only time Johnson seemed to score was after he 
grabbed an offensive rebound. He was a 59% shooter from the field, but seldom 
shot more than 12 times a game. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mulligan signed Johnson during the early signing period last November. 
Johnson is one of three UC Irvine recruits who will participate in the 24th 
Orange County All-Star basketball game at 7:30 p.m. Sunday in the Bren Center. 
Johnson's future teammates Dylan Rigdon of Mater Dei and Craig Marshall of 
Saddleback also will compete. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Khari is a really good athlete, a nice kid and he qualified for 
our admission standards was good enough for me," Mulligan said. "He has a long 
ways to go yet. It's going to take a while for him to adjust to college ball. 
But I really like him." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he's working to become a more versatile player before he enters UC 
Irvine in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"My own friends tell me, 'All you can do is turn on the baseline and dunk.' I 
want to become a better ballhandler and shooter. I'd like to become an 
off-guard. I know I have athletic ability, now it's time to go to work," said 
Johnson, who probably will play small forward at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was impressive last Saturday in an all-star game against the top 
players in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. He had 22 points in a 118-115 
victory, including nine dunks. He is looking forward to the challenge of 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"I chose UCI because I wanted to take my skills to a school where I could work 
to reach the best of my potential," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Potential is a label that has followed Johnson for three years in high school. 
Travers thinks his prized recruit will someday drop the label in college. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Khari develops into a consistent player, you won't hear that word 
'potential' any longer," Travers said.

COUNTY'S S&amp;LS POST PROFIT OF $33.7 MILLION FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's 35 savings and loans posted a combined profit of $33.7 million 
in the first quarter of 1989, as the financial strength of bigger thrifts 
erased losses at more than half of the county's S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Several institutions that only last year were insolvent and were dragging down 
the financial results of healthy thrifts have been turned -- with government 
aid -- into profitable S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Their return to health offset the losses at 18 S&amp;Ls, including 10 smaller 
ones with assets of less than $200 million at the end of March, according to 
the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, which released the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The county's savings institutions haven't posted an annual profit for at least 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller institutions were hurt more acutely than their bigger brethren by 
higher interest rates and slimmer profit margins that wreaked havoc with 
earnings, according to industry leaders and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
And not much change is seen for the second quarter, according to Kirk Hallahan, 
senior vice president of the California League of Savings Institutions, a state 
trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Lending is soft because real estate is soft," Hallahan said. "With rates 
coming down recently, people are holding back to see if they come down more 
before they buy." 
</P>
<P>
The higher interest rates in the first quarter and most of the second meant 
that "thrifts are closing fewer loans, and they can't take in the loan fee 
income and they can't take in interest income," said Barry Rubens, chief 
executive officer of California Research Report, a Santa Monica industry 
consulting and publishing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"They get caught in a squeeze play," he said. "Their costs go up, but their 
revenue doesn't go up as much." 
</P>
<P>
Larger thrifts don't feel the impact as much, partly because they can take 
advantage of economies of scale, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest collective boost for Orange County S&amp;Ls came from the $42 
million earned by American Savings Bank, one of two offshoots of the failed 
American Savings &amp; Loan, which had bogged down county results in previous 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Downey Savings &amp; Loan earned $21 million, and its Butterfield 
Savings subsidiary earned an additional $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond American and Downey, no county S&amp;L posted double-digit earnings. 
</P>
<P>
As in past quarters, the biggest losers also were the most troubled 
institutions. Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, which was seized be regulators in 
April and recently was declared insolvent, lost nearly $29 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Savings Bank and First California Savings Bank, both seized and 
operated by regulators, lost $11.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining money-losing institutions were each less than $1 million in the 
red. 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of March, the county had three insolvent S&amp;Ls -- Pacific, 
First California and Perpetual Savings Assn. -- and at least five thrifts with 
inadequate capital. 
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter, the state's 189 S&amp;Ls posted aggregate earnings of 
$233 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hallahan said that statewide, there are 23 S&amp;Ls that are insolvent under 
regulatory standards.

<P>
American Toxxic Control Inc. has sold BCL Associates Inc. in Huntington Beach 
to Earth Technology Corp. for $690,000, according to a federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission filing. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was announced in May, but neither company had disclosed a price. 
</P>
<P>
BCL is an environmental engineering and laboratory services company with 
revenue last year of $4.5 million. American Toxxic said earlier it was selling 
BCL to raise cash in order to repay debt. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American Toxxic said recently it had again won an extension on 
repayment of $4 million owed to two lenders. American Toxxic borrowed the money 
last year to acquire part of another company, U.S. Filter, and since then has 
obtained several extensions. 
</P>
<P>
American Toxxic, Huntington Beach, makes equipment for cleaning up hazardous 
wastes. Earth Technology, Long Beach, is an environmental engineering 
consultant. MICHAEL FLAGG

More than 300 physicians and other health-care providers owed money by Greater 
San Diego Health Plan, the troubled health maintenance organization operated by 
parent firm Western Health Plans, agreed to a 30-day moratorium on payments. In 
agreeing to the moratorium, the providers selected a creditors committee of 13 
primary care physicians, specialists and hospital representatives. The company 
reported a loss of $7.1 million for the nine months ended March 31 and said 
losses will continue during the fourth quarter ending June 30. The company said 
that the company had a deficit in shareholder equity of more than $16 million 
as of last month. On Thursday, Western Health Plans said it has received an 
unspecified bid from PacifiCare Health Systems of Cypress to buy certain of 
Western's assets. The two companies began negotiations Friday. In American 
Stock Exchange trading Friday, Western Health Plans stock closed up 18 cents at 
87.5 cents a share.

AMPHITHEATER ANTI-NOISE FACTION HAILS COURT RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Both sides in the dispute over noise levels at Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa 
Mesa disagree about the impact of a U.S. Supreme Court decision this week that 
allows New York City to have its own sound engineer at outdoor rock concerts to 
keep the volume down. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled 6-3 that the city could insist on having one of its technicians 
at the Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell in Central Park in order to make certain 
that the park's nearby, 13-acre Sheep Meadow remains a "quiet zone," as decreed 
by Mayor Ed Koch in 1985. The decision overturned a federal appeals court 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
A long-running legal battle pitting the group Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa 
against Ned West Inc. -- the firm which operates the Pacific -- over noise 
generated by rock concerts, has involved the state the county and the city, and 
is now in Orange County Superior Court. The state became embroiled in the 
dispute because it owns the land. Another hearing on the dispute is scheduled 
July 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the court's decision will be of considerable assistance to our 
attorney in pleading our cause," said Russ Millar, a founder of Concerned 
Citizens. "It seems evident on the face of it that this decision will be a 
guideline for the court here." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Papiano, an attorney with the Nederlander Organization, the parent of Ned 
West, said he is familiar with the New York case, but insisted that "there are 
a lot of reasons (the ruling) doesn't have any application" to the Pacific 
Amphitheatre litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never contested the right of a governmental authority to establish a 
standard for sound," Papiano said. "We are within the regulations that have 
been made." 
</P>
<P>
Millar said he believes the decision would "be helpful in our attempt to 
acquire justice for the homeowners. The community is against the outrageous 
noise that comes from the amphitheater." 
</P>
<P>
Papiano, referring to Millar, said that at this point "one person is making 
most of the noise." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the amphitheater used a rented, digital sound system 
designed to beam the sound in a way that would keep it inside the auditorium 
area. The results of the new system are still being assessed.

DESIGN MIX-UP TO DELAY 'SONGS OF WAR' OPENING 
</P>

The crew at the Grove Shakespeare Festival is working feverishly to redesign 
the set of Murray Schisgal's "The Songs of War," which is slated for its world 
premiere at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove as the festival's second offering 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The radical redesign, ordered by the playwright, has forced the postponement of 
the show's opening date from July 7 to July 12, a festival official said 
Friday. Previews will not be affected, however; they will run July 5-9 as 
previously scheduled. "Romeo and Juliet" opened last night as the season's 
first offering, at the Festival Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the "Songs of War" set was designed to look like the back stage of 
a theater, under the Grove's misconception that the work is a backstage play. 
In fact, Schisgal's strongly autobiographical play does revolve around a 
theater performer, and the playwright does want all the props to be visible to 
the audience even when they're not being used. But Schisgal intends the work to 
take place virtually on an empty stage, as though the central character has 
invited an audience to hear the story of his life at a rented theater somewhat 
gone to seed and didn't want to go to any expense to dress up the place. 
</P>
<P>
'KING' CONSIDERED -- At the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, 
officials have added "The King and I" -- with Rudolf Nureyev -- to the list of 
musical revivals being considered for next season's Broadway Series. 
</P>
<P>
The Rodgers and Hammerstein classic, which won the 1952 Tony award, will begin 
a world tour this fall with Nureyev in the role that Yul Brynner once made his 
personal possession. 
</P>
<P>
Other possibilities for the season, reported in The Times in April, are "Les 
Miserables," "Chess" and "Starlight Express" and, more distantly, "Jerome 
Robbins' Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Center President Thomas F. Kendrick said that "Chess" was "not 
necessarily a show we would want" and that "Starlight Express" was "not at the 
top of our list." However, Broadway tour offerings have provided slim pickings. 
The great irony is that next season, Broadway has so many musicals in the 
offing that it doesn't have enough theaters to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
"Les Miz" closes July 23 in Los Angeles after 13 months at the Shubert Theatre 
and goes to San Francisco in mid-October for an open-ended run. "Chess," which 
has a pseudo-rock music score, played London and New York to mixed notices. It 
has been revised and will begin touring in November. 
</P>
<P>
"Starlight Express" also goes on tour in November. Despite negative notices, it 
ran for two years on Broadway and closed in January. "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" 
is scheduled to begin an open-ended run at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles. 
The longer it plays there, the more distant the possibility of its coming to 
the Center.

POCKETS OF THE PAST

They are remnants of a bygone Orange County, pockets of the past on a landscape 
grown increasingly urban. A gas station in Orange built when Packards and 
Duesenbergs ruled the road. A one-room schoolhouse in El Toro. A historic San 
Juan Capistrano neighborhood with homes dating back to the time of mission 
founder Father Junipero Serra. Like a mom and pop grocery store in a 
supermarket age or a two-chair barber shop in an era of trendy hair-styling 
salons, these settings hearken back to a simpler time before orange groves and 
bean fields gave way to crowded freeways and look-alike housing tracts. Their 
survival amid dramatic change is somehow reassuring. And, like rummaging 
through an attic and discovering a dusty old family photo album, stumbling upon 
one of these relics of the county's colorful past invites a pause to reflect on 
times gone by.

Photo, COLOR, 1889 -- Horses and cattle are common sights along Santa Margarita 
Parkway near Rancho Santa Margarita. The new community is being built on part 
of Rancho Mission Viejo, a 40,000-acre working cattle ranch dating back to 
1880s. ; Photo, COLOR, 1900 -- Collection of old gas pumps graces David Chorak 
home in San Juan Capistrano. Two nearby adobes date from 1790s. Most of the 
homes, including Chorak's, were built around 1900. ; Photo, COLOR, 1890 -- 
One-room El Toro Grammar School opened at 1st Street, Olive Avenue in 1890. 
It's now part of Heritage Hill Historical Park on Serrano Road. ; Photo, COLOR, 
1930 -- When it was built in 1930, the Fullerton Station replaced the old Santa 
Fe depot, which was constructed in 1888. It is one of three old stations in the 
city's transportation center. The 1918 Pacific Electric depot and the 1923 
Union Pacific depot now serve as restaurants. ; Photo, COLOR, 1927 -- Tiny 
station with the ski-slope roof on Main Street in Orange was built around 1927. 
But it is still in business as usual at Don Clark's Auto Service. The landmark 
has been owned by Clark, 76, a third-generation county resident, since 1953.

ASK THE JUDGE: SMALL CLAIMS IS LIKELY ROUTE TO GET MORE WAGES 
</P>

Q I do home health care. In April, 1989, I went to work for an agency in 
Orange. The agency sent me to a private home in Ontario, and didn't specify 
what I was making a day. I did, however, overhear a telephone conversation in 
which the woman from the agency said my starting wage was $60 to $90 per 24 
hours depending on the amount of care given. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, I was told that I was no longer needed. I got my first paycheck, 
and I was shocked to learn that I was being paid only $45 per day. 
</P>
<P>
I believe I was shorted on my pay. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
N.Y., 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
A Your letter is not clear, but I am assuming that you were paid by the 
employment agency. There are a variety of ways you could handle your problem. 
You could consult an attorney or you could sue in Small Claims Court for the 
wages you feel are owed to you (no small claim can exceed $1,500). 
</P>
<P>
You may also be able to have your case heard by the state labor commissioner. 
The labor commissioner's office has an information packet which explains how 
and when you can file a claim. The packet is called Claims Processing 
Procedural Pamphlet, and is free to the public. The general information number 
for the Labor Commission is (714) 558-4114. 
</P>
<P>
Q I live in a townhouse complex of 330 units whose association fee was 
determined by the number of bedrooms and square footage. Under this formula, 
the larger the unit, the bigger the fee. 
</P>
<P>
Our CC&amp;Rs (covenants, conditions, and restrictions) used to provide that a 
75% majority of the membership had to approve any changes to the CC&amp;Rs. Our 
board of directors, however, which consists mainly of owners of larger units, 
changed the CC&amp;Rs so that a simple majority vote is all that is required. 
The board then held a special election to change the association fee to a flat 
rate so that all members would pay the same amount. This change passed by a 
majority count, but fell far short of being the 75% majority required by the 
old CC&amp;Rs. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the owners of the smaller units are retired and are on fixed incomes. 
We now feel helpless because the rule now allows the majority owners to mandate 
changes by simply changing the rules. We no longer feel we have any protection 
from future zealous or unscrupulous board members and/or homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
What can we do, other than engaging in a costly court bout? Are there any 
regulatory agencies that oversee that CC&amp;Rs are not abused? 
</P>
<P>
M.O., 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
A As far as I am aware, there are no regulatory agencies which supervise the 
enforcement of CC&amp;Rs. Some knowledgeable people with whom I checked 
suggested that you might attempt to amend the CC&amp;Rs back to the 75% vote 
following the new procedures. They also suggested that you check the CC&amp;Rs 
regarding removal of board members. If your CC&amp;Rs do provide for such 
action, it would also govern the manner in which you should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Q I went to court to fight what I thought was a bad traffic ticket. I didn't 
hire an attorney because I didn't think I would need one and I didn't want to 
spend the money. What a mistake! The police officer appeared with a deputy 
district attorney who questioned me like a criminal. Needless to say, I lost. 
Is this fair? 
</P>
<P>
J.S., 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
A The reason that deputy district attorneys appear at traffic trials is to 
prevent the judge from becoming an advocate rather than a neutral listener of 
the facts. There are some courts which do not require them to handle traffic 
trials, but those judges must be careful that they do not become so involved in 
the questioning of the police officer or the accused traffic violator that they 
can no longer be considered impartial. As a result of this concern, most courts 
do have deputy district attorneys or law clerks who have received permission to 
appear in court to handle traffic trials.

PAINFUL DISEASE ELUDES TESTING; 
</P>
<P>
FIBROMYALGIA FREQUENTLY MISDIAGNOSED, BUT AS MANY AS 3 MILLION IN U.S. HAVE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine that the skin on your hands has been slowly peeled off. Then imagine 
the raw tissue is exposed to the sun for hours. 
</P>
<P>
This is how Patty Dicker, 41, of Newport Beach describes the pain caused by 
fibromyalgia, an often-misdiagnosed and little-researched disease from which 
she has suffered for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Also called fibrositis, the affliction is most common to women (one male for 
every 10 female victims) and is one of the most prevalent, debilitating and 
painful forms of arthritis, afflicting an estimated 3 million people in the 
United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rheumatic disorder with varied symptoms, ranging from sharp or burning 
pain to deep aching in the joints, muscle spasms, headaches, and even feeling 
bruised from head to toe -- so bruised that even the touch of light clothing is 
agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
And while it is not life-threatening, many victims say they have longed for 
death during a flare-up -- a time when on a scale from 1 to 10, the pain is at 
a 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Oddly enough, the pain can move and change within five minutes. It can go from 
your hands to your knee or neck, or all over the body," said Dicker, a tall, 
willowy blonde who looks the picture of health. "You can feel no pain and go to 
open a door and pull back because the doorknob has hurt you. It's like living 
in a mine field. You never know what's going to hurt you. I look at myself and 
I look healthy. My hand looks normal and yet it's burning with pain." 
</P>
<P>
Loss of energy is another symptom of the disease. Many sufferers don't have the 
strength even to brush their own hair, let alone maintain a job or take care of 
children and household duties. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been very active," says 58-year-old Amy Howard of Brea, who 
started having symptoms of fibromyalgia in 1984 after suffering a back injury 
at work. She has been to countless doctors and through hundreds of tests in the 
past four years. But the disease is undetectable by most medical tests and is 
often dismissed as "all in the head." 
</P>
<P>
"At times, I thought I was going crazy," Howard said. "It was hard to explain 
the pain because it changed daily, sometimes hourly. I was exhausted all the 
time and as a result very depressed. I felt the doctors just thought I was a 
hypochondriac." 
</P>
<P>
More than once, Howard was told she should see a psychologist. Even her husband 
and children were skeptical at first. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so guilty about not being able to work or do housework. I could just 
lie around all day and when I heard my husband's car in the driveway I would 
struggle up and pretend that I was doing something." 
</P>
<P>
She recently visited a rheumatologist who diagnosed her as having fibromyalgia. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost a relief. Now at least I know I'm not going crazy," she said. 
"But I must learn to live with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating. I've always loved people, always loved to work. Now I 
don't even have the strength to play with my own grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
Being told it "was all in the head" is a common story among the afflicted 
because many doctors are unfamiliar with fibromyalgia (of about 500,000 
physicians in the United States, only 3,000 are rheumatologists). 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the Arthritis Foundation's goal is to educate health professionals 
about it," said Pat Atwell, spokesperson for the local chapter of the 
foundation, located in Santa Ana. "Fibromyalgia is new, within the past 15 
years, as far as any research being done and even in naming the disease." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Don L. Goldenberg of the Arthritis Center at Boston University said:"There 
were no scientific papers related to the syndrome presented at the annual 
meeting of the American Rheumatism Assn. in 1981, but there were nine presented 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the 'state-of-the-art' lectures at the 1987 meeting was a review of 
fibromyalgia. At our annual meetings, the attendance at the 
nonarticular-rheumatism study group, largely devoted to fibromyalgia, has 
tripled in the past five years." 
</P>
<P>
There is no set definition of the disease. The symptoms are varied and vague. 
However, most North American rheumatologists seem to agree that patients with 
fibromyalgia have the following common features: widespread musculoskeletal 
pain (usually accompanied by stiffness that is worse in the morning); chronic 
fatigue and poor endurance; the presence of multiple tender points; a variation 
in symptoms depending on the weather, overexertion and stress, and a decrease 
of symptoms with heat therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, 58-year-old Norma Borie of Long Beach awoke feeling as though 
she had torn every muscle in her chest. The following day, the excruciating 
pain had spread to the rest of her body, so unbearable that she had to be 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
After finally being diagnosed, she said, "I remember lying in my hospital bed 
and hearing the nurses whispering about me in the hall as they looked at my 
chart. Only one of them had even heard of the disease. They were afraid to care 
for me because they didn't know what the disease was." 
</P>
<P>
Borie says she made up her mind then that she would do everything in her power 
to help promote research and education for the disease and donated $300,000 to 
the Arthritis Foundation for just that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Because of her donation and others, word is spreading via telethons, literature 
distributed by the Arthritis Foundation and symposiums. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, support groups have been formed for sufferers of the disease. FAN 
(Fibromyalgia Awareness Network) in Orange County had its first meeting a year 
ago. Sixty women showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very emotional meeting," recalled Betty Moriarity, a 62-year-old Long 
Beach teacher who was forced to take early retirement because she kept falling 
asleep in class. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of crying. It was such a relief to know that you're not alone. 
Just to be able to communicate with others who could relate to the pain and 
psychological stresses you've been through brought a certain amount of 
serenity. I was amazed that there was such a large number of us." 
</P>
<P>
FAN meets every fourth Tuesday from 2 to 3:30 p.m. in the Plaza Classroom at 
the Medical Center of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The group offers discussion sessions as well as speakers such as Dr. Bob 
Merlino from the Chapman Pain Clinic, who recently spoke on the control of 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
A cure has not been found for fibromyalgia. Once diagnosed, patients are put on 
a combination of therapies to help control the symptoms. These include diet, 
antidepressants, exercise, cortisone shots at the trigger points, biofeedback, 
heat massage and pain-coping techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Therapies and their effectiveness differ from patient to patient. Patty Dicker 
considers herself lucky. Her first therapy of medication left her pain-free for 
almost three years. Her next flare-up was not eased by the same medication, and 
a whole new combination of drugs was prescribed. She had two more years free of 
pain, although her trigger points never disappeared. She recently had another 
flare-up and began exploring a new medication therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Borie has never been free of pain. "I'm always in about a Level-7 pain. 
When I have a flare-up, I feel as though I'm going to die. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a very physical, touch-oriented person. My husband used to 
lay next to me at night and hold my hand at first -- but now the pain is too 
much even for that. The thought of someone touching me makes me cringe. I miss 
my hugs."

ON THE WATERFRONT: FLOATING MARINE LAB IS FOR CHILDREN -- AND, NOW, THEIR 
PARENTS

With a pair of tweezers, Angela Baca, 9, gingerly lifts a tiny sea worm so that 
she can inspect it at closer range. As one of 26 pint-size marine scientists 
aboard the 65-foot vessel Sum Fun, Angela is getting a rare opportunity to see 
the tiny creatures that live in the mud 200 feet below the ocean's surface. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 schoolchildren like Angela have gone to sea in Orange 
County's Floating Marine Lab program since it began in 1968. But now that 
school is out for the summer, it's the parents' turn. 
</P>
<P>
Each summer, the popular children's program offers more than a dozen cruises 
that are open to the public of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
"The summer programs are for the whole family," says Tom Moylan, assistant 
director of education for the Orange County Marine Institute, which sponsors 
the shipboard labs. "Often kids who've gone on the program during the school 
year bring their parents and come back." 
</P>
<P>
Floating Lab dusk cruises are being offered from 6 to 9 p.m. beginning June 30 
and continuing each Friday through Aug. 25. But you had better book passage now 
because the popular programs fill up fast. The June 30, July 14 and July 28 
cruises are already sold out, Moylan says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the dusk cruises, this year the institute is offering weekend 
excursions aboard a larger boat -- the 85-foot Van Tuna, Occidental College's 
research vessel. The weekend cruises begin July 15 and continue through Aug. 6. 
Cost for both programs is $20 for adults and $10 for children age 12 and under. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea behind the program is to get people out to have hands-on sea 
experience and to see things they wouldn't ordinarily see," says Moylan, a 
marine biologist who has been working aboard the Floating Lab for the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent cruise, most of the children had never before ventured out on the 
ocean. Just watching the boat rise and fall with each swell is new and 
exciting. The Sum Fun is headed a mile out to sea so that samples can be 
scooped up from depths of 200 feet or more. Along the way, plankton will be 
gathered and examined with a sophisticated video microscope system. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in deeper water, a digging tool called a Peterson Grab is lowered to the 
ocean's muddy floor where its large jaw-like buckets are clamped shut. The grab 
sampler is then raised and hauled aboard the boat, where the children are 
encouraged to take a handful of sediment and look for the tiny inhabitants that 
live in or on the muddy bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"Look what he got," says 10-year-old Alyssa Skillman, pointing to a boy holding 
a small, cone-shaped organism in the palm of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Ugh, I got a worm," says Angelina Gonzales, wrinkling her nose in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Moylan and colleague Steve Grod help the children identify several sea 
cucumbers, sand cone tube worms and mustache worms in this day's haul. In 
classroom studies, the children have already learned about the organisms and 
now they get to hold them. They also learn that such organisms are called 
benthic animals because they live in or on the benthos -- the surface of the 
ground underneath the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"If you just looked at that pile of mud, you wouldn't know that all these 
different things were in there, would you?" Grod asks as he washes the mud from 
the organisms and places them on a screen for closer inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a totally different ecosystem," Moylan says. "And they get to compare 
and contrast these animals, which most of them would never get to see." 
</P>
<P>
After examining the mud samples, the children are ready to set an otter trawl 
net, which, like the Peterson Grab, is lowered to the ocean floor. A chain 
along the lower edge of the net holds it against the bottom, while a float 
holds the top edge up. Water pressure against the doors of the net holds the 
mouth open as the net is pulled through the water with the movement of the 
boat. After 15 minutes, the children help haul in the net and squeal with 
delight when they find it full of a great variety of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Grod and Moylan deposit the fish in individual shallow tanks where the children 
help identify and get to handle them. But before they begin, Grod delivers a 
stern warning: "Remember these are live animals, not toys." 
</P>
<P>
For most passengers -- children and adults -- this portion is a highlight of 
the cruise. This day's haul includes a California skate, a scorpion fish, a 
horny-head turbot and a small red octopus. In all, there are nearly a dozen 
different types of fish. Moylan helps identify each one and then allows the 
students to get a close-up look, actually passing the fish around hand-to-hand. 
Afterward, most of the fish are released. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that 70% of the fish survive," Moylan says. "Those that don't, go back 
to the lab for the final portion of the program." That portion, which follows 
the two-hour cruise, is a one-hour hands-on examination of the specimens, 
including a dissection. 
</P>
<P>
The institute, which runs 40 to 50 sea labs each month during the school year, 
has refined each cruise so efficiently that, during the busiest months of April 
and May, four different labs can be held on the same boat, on the same day. 
"And we seldom have to cancel one," Moylan says. "We probably have to cancel 
only about two or three a year because of bad weather. Southern California is 
perfect for this." 
</P>
<P>
During the school year, about 13,000 students from fourth grade through college 
participate in the labs, Moylan says. During the summer another 500 adults take 
part in cruises. Although most participants live in Orange County, students 
frequently come from other parts of the state as well as Arizona, Nevada and 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"People from Australia, New Zealand and Japan have come over to study the 
program -- to observe and to put together a program like it of their own," 
Moylan says. 
</P>
<P>
Moylan sees the labs as an opportunity to educate a large number of people 
about the importance of one of the earth's most valuable resources -- the 
ocean. "I'm hoping they'll get a first-hand appreciation of the ocean and how 
vital it is to us. That they'll learn to help protect the ocean. That they'll 
learn that we are all tied in this together."

Photographer Susan Miles doesn't just look at nature, she examines it in fine 
detail. She takes an ordinary subject -- flowers -- and moves in close to give 
a view that most people just pass by. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four of her 11-by-14-inch Cibachrome prints are on exhibit at Rizzoli 
International Bookstore &amp; Gallery at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa until 
July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Miles, 43, of Laguna Beach, became interested in photography by shooting 
pictures of her children. Next, she turned to pictures of neighbors and soon 
turned it into a business. Many of her pictures were black-and-white shots of 
children in natural settings. 
</P>
<P>
After five years, she put her camera down and she moved with her husband to a 
small ranch in Oregon where she wanted to rear her children. They stayed there 
for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
It was after her daughter, Janice, died two years ago of heart disease at the 
age of 22 that they decided to move back to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We waited a year (after Janice died), then we decided we needed the change and 
the sunshine," she said. "The rain up there is fine if you're not sad. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a strange thing. My husband took a position down here and we were 
wrapping things up with our home up there. I drove down with him. While 
driving, I came up with the idea for the photographs and a book with the title, 
'The Heart of the Flower.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a book about the beauty of the flowers we don't see. It went 
together with Jan dying of heart disease. At her memorial service the minister 
said: 'She wore her beauty inside and out.' That's what we put on her marker at 
the cemetery. It was very true of her. It just fit together. It went together." 
</P>
<P>
Miles has been shooting close-ups of flowers for the book since August. She 
learned to make Cibachrome prints at Saddleback College under the direction of 
teacher Jerry Burchfield. After the Costa Mesa exhibition her work will be 
displayed in three galleries in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Miles' 11-by-14-inch prints are museum matted and sell for $200. Her pictures 
were shot in a variety of places from her garden to local botanical gardens. 
The flowers include magnolias, irises, cactus flowers, orchids and nasturtiums. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to capture the inner beauty," Miles said.
