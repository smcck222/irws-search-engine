STOWAWAY ON A SLAVE SHIP TO AFRICA; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE PASSAGE BY CHARLES JOHNSON (ATHENEUM: $17.95; 288 PP.; 0-689-11968-2)

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Johnson's first book, "Black Humor," was published 20 years ago in 
Chicago, and that collection of drawings -- political cartoons, really -- 
startles now, when viewed through the lens of history, his and ours. The art is 
skillful, the captions trenchant. The theme is race relations, but the tone not 
what we might have expected from a young black college student living near one 
of the most racially polarized of American cities, in one of its worst times: 
Bobby Seale bound and gagged at the Chicago 8 trial; Fred Hampton dead in a 
police raid on his southside apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson remembers these cartoons as inspired by the black separatist philosophy 
of Amiri Baraka, whom he'd heard lecture at Southern Illinois University, 
taking no questions from whites. What strikes you about "Black Humor" now, 
though, is its gentleness, and its tentative exploration at times of territory 
beyond racial polarization. A raceless kangaroo whose pouch contains two joeys 
-- one black, one white -- reads a newspaper with the headline "New Open 
Housing Rules." A black rally speaker, having excoriated black integrationists 
as Uncle Toms, leaves through the stage door with a white woman who calls him 
"Tom." A black couple prepare to tell their white child what he apparently 
hasn't yet figured out. 
</P>
<P>
Fast forward two decades, and Johnson -- having done graduate work in 
philosophy and turned from visual art to fiction -- is director of the Creative 
Writing Program at the University of Washington, with three published novels to 
his credit, as well as a collection of short stories ("The Sorcerer's 
Apprentice") nominated in 1986 for the PEN/Faulkner award and a recent 
book-length study of black writing since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In his highly readable though densely philosophical fiction, Johnson gives us 
characters forced to chart a middle passage between competing ways of ordering 
reality: sensual or ascetic, Marxist or Freudian, Christian or pagan. They 
quest for a unity of being beyond all polarities, for what the heroine of his 
first novel calls "the one thing all . . . things have in common. And happily 
for them and for us, they usually find it. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson describes "Middle Passage" as an effort at "serious entertainment," a 
blurring, in other words, of another ancient pair of opposites, philosophy and 
art. He shares with his mentor, the late novelist and critic John Gardner, the 
Tolstoyan conviction that all true art is moral, not the promulgating of 
doctrine (which inevitably distorts morality) but the exploration and testing 
of values. 
</P>
<P>
The formula fits "Middle Passage." Though never preachy, it's informed by a 
remarkably generous thesis: that racism generally, and the institution of 
slavery in particular, might best be seen as having arisen not from political 
or sociological or economic causes, not (God help us) from pigment envy, but 
from a deep fissure that characterizes Western thought in general, our tendency 
to split the world into competing categories: matter and spirit, subject and 
object, good and evil, black and white. One of the novel's epigraphs, from the 
"Upanishads," grows increasingly rich in implication as we read "Middle 
Passage": "Who sees variety and not the Unity wanders on from death to death." 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford Calhoun, a newly freed 22-year-old slave from southern Illinois, 
drifts into New Orleans in 1829 and experiences a shock of recognition. For 
Rutherford, who narrates the story, the city is a place of sensory overload, an 
assault of smells, "if not a town devoted to an almost religious pursuit of 
Sin, then at least to steamy sexuality." The city suits his desire for 
adventure, experience, excess; it seems to be himself. His opposites are the 
Creoles downstream, who "sniffed down their long Continental noses at poor, 
purebred Negroes" like him. So he falls in among the thieves and gamblers 
upriver and becomes one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford further defines himself in opposition to Woman. Isadora Bailey, whom 
he encounters one morning at the waterfront, is pretty "in a prim, dry, 
flat-breasted way," and everything Rutherford isn't: "frugal, quiet, devoutly 
Christian." She is completely, in other words, out of place in New Orleans. 
Rutherford regards this daughter of a large Boston family free since the 
Revolutionary War as "positively ill with eastern culture." Naturally, she 
wants to reform him. Naturally, he resists reformation -- to the point of 
stowing away on a slave clipper bound for Africa to escape marriage to her. 
(She has arranged the marriage with his creditor by paying off Rutherford's 
debts.) 
</P>
<P>
By turns mimicking historical romance, slave narrative, picaresque tale, 
parable, and (finally) sea yarn, indebted (among many other writers) to Swift, 
Coleridge, Melville, and Conrad, "Middle Passage" invites but frustrates 
categorization. And that's exactly its point. The storytelling sounds 
historically credible at first (Johnson's research and command of language are 
impressive), but the counternaturalistic signals begin early, and they're 
intended. Idioms have sometimes a distinctly modern flavor: "down to earth" to 
describe Isadora's father, "hung over" to describe Rutherford. All the 
characters in "Middle Passage," in fact, sound as if they're double majors in 
classics and philosophy. "It seemed so Sisyphean," says Rutherford of a 
lovelorn fellow sailor, "this endless seeking of a single woman's love . . . in 
all others, because they would change, grow old, and he'd again be on a 
quixotic, Parmenidean quest for beauty beyond the reach of Becoming." His 
narrative comes to resemble an act of ventriloquism, a dreamlike projection of 
20th-Century writer into the voice of roguish ex-slave, the writer winking 
behind the mask at time, blurring past and present. There's no clear line 
between Rutherford's world and our world, his journey and our journey. All 
polarities collapse by design here. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition between Ebeneezer Falcon and Peter Cringle, captain and first 
mate of the metaphorically named "Republic," furthers Rutherford's process of 
self-definition on the passage to Africa. Cringle is Isadora in drag: a 
gentleman whose "whole air spoke of New England gentility." 
</P>
<P>
Falcon, by contrast, is a carnival sideshow: a pederast, solipsist, and dwarf. 
He too seems to have taken a first in philosophy. Dualism is a permanent 
biological condition, he tells Rutherford: "Subject and object, perceiver and 
perceived, self and other -- these ancient twins are built into the mind like 
the stem-piece of a merchantman. We cannot think without them, sir. And what, 
pray, kin such a thing mean? Only this, Mr. Calhoun, they are signs of a 
transcendantal Fault, a deep crack in consciousness itself . . . . Slavery, if 
you think this through, forcing yourself not to flinch, is the social correlate 
of a deeper, ontic wound." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Cringle plans to set him adrift. 
</P>
<P>
Between Cringle and Falcon, Rutherford can't choose, though both try to force 
him to. He can't find his loyalties, though he seems to take up and put down 
each of their perspectives at times. His unwillingness to choose makes sense, 
since Johnson blurs all ethical categories, showing the ministerial Cringle 
unable to "see himself, his own blighted history, in the slaves," the satanic 
Falcon ("known for his daring exploits and subjugation of the colored races" 
capable of generosity in the end. Not until "The Republic" takes on its cargo 
in Africa -- 40 Allmuseri tribesmen and their mysterious totem -- does 
Rutherford finally begin to declare an allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson creates the Allmuseri for pretty obvious thematic reasons. An ancient 
tribe of magicians, they are less a biological clan than one held together by 
shared values. For Rutherford, who feels "the presence of countless others in 
them," they are the "Ur-tribe of humanity itself." Without fingerprints, 
incapable of abstract thought, unable to distinguish the white crewmen as 
individuals, the Allmuseri envision Hell as the failure to experience "the 
unity of Being everywhere." And their god -- which Falcon has plundered for the 
most Western of reasons, fame and fortune -- is King Kong, Tolkien's ring and 
Spielberg's ark all rolled into one. Even Falcon recognizes it's beyond 
dualism: "The Allmuseri god," he tells Rutherford, "is everything, so that the 
very knowing situation we mortals rely on -- a separation between knower and 
known -- never rises in its experience." 
</P>
<P>
The Allmuseri become Rutherford's vehicle for self-knowledge, providing him 
with a passage beyond categories, beyond opposites, beyond desire and fear, and 
toward what we would want for him, and for ourselves. "Middle Passage," 
suffused with the quasi-Buddhist sensibility that seems increasingly common in 
Western writing today, ends quietly, surprisingly. 
</P>
<P>
What always saves the novel from the intellectual scheme that would otherwise 
kill it is the sheer beauty of its language. Here is Rutherford's vision of his 
father's death 20 years earlier: "I beheld his benighted history and misspent 
manhood turn toward the night he plotted his escape to the Promised Land. It 
was New Year's Eve, anno 1811. For good luck he took with him a little of the 
fresh greens and peas Chandler's slaves cooked at year's end (greens for 
"greenbacks" and peas for "change"), then took himself to the stable, saddled 
one of the horses and, since he had never ventured more than ten miles from 
home, wherefore lost his way, was quickly captured by padderolls and quietly 
put to death, the bullet entering through his left eye, exiting through his 
right ear, leaving him eternally eight and twenty, an Eternal Object, pure 
essence rotting in a fetid stretch of Missouri swamp." 
</P>
<P>
Philosophy and art are not simply joined here. They are one.

I'd like to thank cable's Family Channel for the syndicated repeats of 
"Scarecrow and Mrs. King." I was a devoted fan when it aired on CBS (1983-87) 
and I can tell you that even after an absence of three years, I'm more devoted 
to the series than ever. I'm hoping the Family Channel does not drop this show 
any time soon.

The June 3 TV Times cover on the nightmarish "Tales From the Crypt" turned into 
a parent's nightmare, or should I say children's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
I guess I could have ripped the cover page off our TV Times or try to hide it. 
</P>
<P>
I guess what I'm saying is I'd just wish a slightly less scarier picture had 
been used so our entire family, which includes my 4-year-old son, could have 
enjoyed it. I also have an 8-year-old and we often peruse TV Times together to 
encourage reading.

THE DARK ROMANCE OF DIAN FOSSEY BY HAROLD T. P. HAYES (SIMON &amp; SHUSTER: 
$21.95; 384 PP.; 0-671-6339-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Charles Bowden, Bowden is a free-lance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
They put her in a cage with the other whites, and then one by one the men were 
taken out and slaughtered. She was raped repeatedly, but somehow through force 
of will survived, got out of the Congo and made it to Uganda, and finally 
Rwanda. She had been studying gorillas for six months in a freezing rain 
forest, living alone except for a few thieving African helpers. She buried this 
incident, only briefly alluding to it later under rare circumstances; buried it 
so that she would not be recalled by her sponsors, so that she could continue 
the study that became "Gorillas in the Mist," the book and the movie. That is 
the Dian Fossey of story and legend. 
</P>
<P>
Or, this never really happened, as some believe, including her then-fiance, 
Alexie Forrester, an old Africa hand and a man not likely to underestimate the 
continent's capacity for barbarism or succumb easily to stories that do not 
quite add up. The late Harold T. Hayes in his biography, "The Dark Romance of 
Dian Fossey," must grapple with a lot of stories that may or may not add up, 
but as he wends his way through the various accounts (the book is based on more 
than 200 interviews) including Fossey's own talent for fabrication, he keeps 
his eye on one thing: Dian Fossey, the extraordinary woman who more than any 
other single person brought mountain gorillas into the conciousness of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have read Farley Mowat's uncritical biography, "Woman of the Mists," 
are in for a kind of jolt -- the same characters and incidents occur but with a 
completely different interpretation. Also, the warm Dian Fossey of her journals 
and letters is largely absent here -- whether for legal reasons that limit use 
of such material, or for other reasons, it is hard to say. 
</P>
<P>
What stands out in both books is a very powerful human being. She was a person 
who could nurse and sleep with orphaned infant gorillas, the diarrhea from the 
sick youngsters gushing across her, ignore her rotting teeth and swollen jaw, 
fight off African poachers as a witch, start letter wars with European zoos, 
work without salary while living on potatoes, chain-smoke as she struggled up 
10,000-foot peaks, and in one year make 485 hours of observations of mountain 
gorillas (versus renowned scholar George Schaller's 466 in 18 months). All this 
accomplished in an environment where a strapping American male assistant went 
from 195 to 145 pounds in about three months, and then left the region 
entirely. She was a piece of work, and this book tells us as much as we are 
likely to learn about how she got the way she was. It is compelling, 
disturbing, and for those who dream of renown and rewards without the pain of 
earning them a useful corrective. 
</P>
<P>
She was born in California to a fashion model mother and a father, who after a 
divorce had no contact with her until she was an adult. Her stepfather was 
rich, and she was reared comfortably in Atherton. Over six feet tall, she had 
little sense of selfesteem, became a therapist and fled her family for a 
position working with handicapped children in Louisville, Ky., a deadend job 
where she stayed 10 years. She lived alone in the woods, took in stray dogs and 
seemed to never have a man in her life. By her mid-30s, she sensed some kind of 
emptiness, and though engaged to Rhodesian Alexie Forrester, pitched herself to 
Louis Leakey as another Jane Goodall, and by Jan. 1, 1967, was high on the 
mountain studying gorillas. She had no background in the sciences, was not a 
naturalist, knew little of Africa, was physically unfit, and lacked any talent 
whatsoever for dealing with people of other cultures. And of course, in the end 
she succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
In this age of bloated biographies of virtual nonentities, Hayes has produced a 
bare-bones text crammed with significant incidents and one that refrains from 
psychobabble as a form of explanation. And Fossey is the kind of person who 
would tempt any one to produce some kind of explanation for her behavior. 
Although there are clues from her childhood (abandoned by her natural father, 
hostile to her stepfather, convinced of her unattractiveness) her coldness and 
fear of getting close to people, the physical facts of her life in Africa would 
produce either an iron will or total breakdown in many people. The national 
park she lived in was 25 miles by four miles, and set in Rwanda, which is one 
of the most overpopulated nations in the world with 600 people per square mile. 
When she arrived, the 400 mountain gorillas were tottering on the lip of 
extinction, and when she died in 1985, a little more than 200 remained and the 
park had shrunk. Choosing intimate contact with the gorillas over the calm, 
objective viewing of them (to the continuing consternation of many scientists), 
she gradually became accepted by the various groups, formed what looks like 
friendships with individuals such as the famous Digit, and finally was able to 
sit inside the groups and move with them, be touched by them, seemingly to be 
accepted by them -- much of this captured on film by the great love of her 
life, Bob Campbell. And while her research continued, the gorillas were 
slaughtered by poachers stealing infants for European zoos (in one period in 
1948, 60 gorillas died protecting 11 infants seized for zoos), by natives 
seeking skulls for collectors, and by her neighbors apparently outraged by her 
brutal behavior toward them. She threatened them with black magic, had their 
genitals flogged with stinging nettles, shot their cattle, kidnaped their 
children, and sought to have poachers killed on sight. By 1979, she was writing 
letters such as this one to the American ambassador in Rwanda: "It is only a 
matter for the President to give the order -- KILL -- (because) the prisons are 
already overcrowded and this is the only way we are going to be able to protect 
the remaining gorillas." Nor was she much kinder to the various researchers and 
helpers that flocked from around the world to join her in her work. The book is 
littered with former friends now enemies. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, in late December, 1985, she was slaughtered in her cabin on the 
mountain by a person or persons unknown. They made her grave in her gorilla 
cemetary where she had buried her friends like Digit. Hayes doesn't solve her 
murder, but he does leave one with the feeling that it hardly matters -- a lot 
of people had reason to hate Fossey, and by the time of her death, drinking 
heavily, her lungs shot from smoking, she didn't seem to like herself much 
either. 
</P>
<P>
This is hardly a debunking biography or an expose but it does make us face the 
fact that people we admire may not be people we would like had we met them. I 
doubt that it will be the last word on this remarkable person, but it certainly 
is the most searing. She has been a legend, a movie, books and a cause. Now she 
is made flesh. Fossey did a great thing and paid a great price -- her 
loneliness at times is almost unbearable. She drew our attention not just to 
gorillas but to possibilities of other forms of life. No one who reads this 
book will likely forget her sitting in the forest with two blond-haired little 
girls while a gorilla strokes their locks with amazement. I certainly won't.

RICHARD EDER: THE DARK AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL; 
</P>
<P>
THE INNOCENT BY IAN MCEWAN (DOUBLEDAY: $18.95; 270 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something there is that does not like a tunnel. It is the theme of Ian McEwan's 
provocative though erratic novel of espionage, set in Berlin during the early 
intensity of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
A novel of espionage, that is, with spying as metaphor for a larger type of 
human isolation. Graham Greene used the thriller genre in a similar way, and 
although there are one or two aspects of "The Innocent" that may suggest John 
Le Carre, a closer comparison is to such Greene entertainments as "Brighton 
Rock" and "The Confidential Agent." 
</P>
<P>
In his non-entertainments, such as "The Child in Time" and "The Cement Garden," 
McEwan, who is English, wrote about people living tightly on the verge of 
disintegration. The verge is society's, too; McEwan's human and social textures 
have the translucence of skin stretched over infection. The skin rips 
unpredictably, but the rips are tiny and the poison leaks without really 
draining. 
</P>
<P>
"The Innocent" is more spectacular; its rips are volcanic eruptions, though the 
result is not purgation but parody. It is not as serious as its predecessors, 
though it is more fun and likely to be more popular. It stretches the nerves. 
It does not stretch the mind so much as pluck at it. 
</P>
<P>
McEwan bases his story upon a real event. In 1955, the American and British 
intelligence services built a tunnel into East Berlin to tap the main 
East-German and Soviet telephone cable. The tap worked for a year until the 
Russians discovered it. In fact, they seem to have known about it all along, 
thanks to the work of a British mole, George Blake. 
</P>
<P>
McEwan brings in Blake as a peripheral figure, though significant to the plot; 
he mentions one or two other real people, and he uses a lot of real detail. The 
story and its main characters are fictional, though. The fiction is a tight 
weave of spy story, love story and parable; along with black comedy that goes 
from wild as an adjective, to wild as a verb; as New York's Central Park 
muggers used it: as Doomsday assault. 
</P>
<P>
Using a classic device, McEwan introduces Leonard Marnham, his innocent, into 
an infinitely non-innocent world. By the end, this human tabula rasa will not 
only have registered every kink and whorl in this world, but go on to out-kink 
and out-whorl it. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard is diffident, polite and virginal. He lives with his parents in a 
semi-detached London house, and works as a technician in the research 
laboratories of the British telephone system. Suddenly he finds himself 
transferred to Berlin, awestruck at having a two-bedroom apartment, a job 
assembling and servicing taping equipment in the tunnel project, and the 
patronage of Glass, a hard-charging CIA operative who is his boss and mentor. 
</P>
<P>
One kind of virginity is ruptured as Leonard revels -- though shyly -- in being 
a secret agent and a "conqueror" in a Berlin that is still war-shattered and 
subservient. Another kind goes when he meets Maria, a young German woman who 
works for the British occupation forces. 
</P>
<P>
Maria is not as innocent as Leonard. She suffered under the Russian invasion 
and under a brutal husband whom she divorced, but who still turns up to abuse 
her. She has an edge of hard-won practicality, but she is gentle, as well, and 
Leonard is a lover with whom she can take the initiative and not be frightened. 
Burrowing under layers of blankets in her tiny, freezing apartment, they are 
two furry moles, tender, passionate and snug. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tunnel, though, as well: hidden, cut-off and generating its own 
peculiar passions. If Leonard's secret identity allows him to imagine himself 
as Berlin's conqueror, his seclusion with Maria brings out a spark of sadism. 
It is brief and tentative -- Maria walks out for awhile, reaching the tunnel, 
in effect -- and he is utterly ashamed of himself. 
</P>
<P>
As for the spy tunnel, it nourishes other kinds of baleful fantasies. Glass 
personifies the illusion of a secret allied advantage over the Russians; though 
at the end, he emerges as oddly sympathetic. And Leonard is recruited by the 
senior British agent to spy upon the Americans, who are the abrasive senior 
partners in the project. 
</P>
<P>
In a wonderful introductory scene, Glass initiates Leonard into the world of 
clearance levels. Level 1 -- the public level: The building from which the 
tunnel operation starts is ostensibly a military warehouse. Level 2 -- for the 
building contractors: It is really a radar installation. Level 3 -- for the 
true initiates, the technicians digging the tunnel and operating the equipment: 
It is the telephone tap. 
</P>
<P>
Glass is immensely proud of these layers of knowledge -- a tunnel within a 
tunnel within a tunnel. Is there a Level 4? If there is, Glass says, he doesn't 
know about it. But of course, there is; it is the British subplot. And this 
subplot will eventually allow Leonard to outwit all four levels when his tunnel 
life with Maria goes grotesquely wrong, and in a fashion, save them both. 
</P>
<P>
McEwan's account of the building and installation of the communications tap is 
taut and exciting. Much more remarkable is his skill in using the tunnels -- 
real and metaphorical -- as instruments of both moral suspense and black humor. 
His tunnels, in fact, are like the doors in French farce; they switch us 
comically between revelation and mystification. 
</P>
<P>
Other things are less successful. The story of Leonard and Maria, darkening 
steadily, gets out of hand when her husband appears. There is a brutal fight, a 
killing, and 12 unsparingly detailed pages about the dismemberment of a body. 
It is brilliantly done, in its own way, but it is all but unbearable to read. 
</P>
<P>
More seriously, it is like a power surge that blows out the wiring. The 
morality farce takes over again, but we may be too jangled to appreciate it. 
Furthermore, after so much tension, the ending seems lackadaisical and routine. 
An epilogue, set years later, turns this routine ending into a "happy" ending 
that is utterly banal. It is as if McEwan, having set up his complex and 
powerful device, had lost both control and interest. 
</P>
<P>
"The Innocent" provides a series of strong and often subtle sensations. But 
there is something about them that resembles not so much the experience of a 
story as the kind of pseudo-experience administered by electrodes attached to 
nerve receptors. The taste is indistinguishable from the real thing, but the 
aftertaste is flat. "The Innocent" evokes a dark moral world in a highly 
entertaining fashion. Unlike Greene's entertainments, however, McEwan's leaves 
not even the trace of a feeling behind it.

COVER STORY: JEFF GOLDBLUM: STILL LOOKING FOR HIS NICHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting down in a room with Jeff Goldblum is a little bit like stepping into a 
David Lynch film. Time slows down, and things are not always what they seem. "I 
like to be at home. We just got this new dog. We only have one television. It's 
not in the bedroom. It's in the living room, and it's quite big. We got a new 
couch, and I like that a lot. It's very, very comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
As the dark, lanky actor spoke, his words spilled out in a rocky stream that 
split into divides and tributaries, sometimes intersecting, other times drying 
up, leading nowhere. His hands moved constantly, rising and falling, tapping 
his legs, clutching his chest. He seemed to approach the interview like he 
would a role in a movie, searching for the reality of the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff is very serious about trying to find a reality, a truth, to his 
character, and he works very hard at that," said director Dean Parisot, who 
directed Goldblum in HBO's movie "Framed," which debuts Sunday at 9 p.m. The 
offbeat crime caper finds Goldblum as a frustrated painter framed for art 
forgery by his lover, Kristin Scott-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff is continually talking his role through and trying to find the nuances 
and realities," Parisot continued. "He works hard at that. He doesn't stop." 
</P>
<P>
Goldblum was working when he met his wife and frequent co-star, Geena Davis, on 
the 1985 comedy "Transylvania 6-5000." The two were courting the next year on 
the set of "The Fly" and married when they shot last year's "Earth Girls Are 
Easy." 
</P>
<P>
While Davis is getting involved in larger studio projects -- she won an Oscar 
for best supporting actress in 1988's "The Accidental Tourist" and stars in the 
summer film "Quick Change" with Bill Murray -- Goldblum's path remains 
eclectic. 
</P>
<P>
He has three new films awaiting release. In "The Tall Guy," Goldblum stars as 
an actor who finds work in a musical version of "The Elephant Man." "Mad 
Monkey" casts Goldblum in a dark story of sexual obsession with a young girl, 
and in the psychological thriller "Mr. Frost," Goldblum's co-star is Alan 
Bates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all acting has to be like a sporting event," said Goldblum, whose 
new-found passion is boxing. The 38-year-old actor is reading "Reading the 
Fight," a series of literary boxing essays. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be something involved in the process of acting that's like a real 
living of life, even though it's under imaginary circumstances," Goldblum said, 
his 6-foot, 4-inch frame draped over a comparatively small chair in his 
publicist's Beverly Hills office. "It has to really take you into your own 
future, your unsolved future. And you allow the struggle of that to be 
witnessed. Then acting is like a sporting event. If it's not that, it's not 
good. It's bad." 
</P>
<P>
He paused. "Do you get what I mean? It's kind of abstract." 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to classify Goldblum. He's an actor who hasn't really found his 
niche, and doesn't want to fall into one. "I hope that I'm not thought of in 
any restrictive way. Because I'm not sure how I'm going to feel tomorrow, or 
what kind of part I want, or who I'm going to be tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
His credits are like a goulash; there's a little something in there for 
everyone. There's the Adult Film ("The Big Chill"); the Romantic Comedy ("Into 
the Night"); the Mindless Comedy ("Vibes"); the Action Film ("Death Wish"); the 
Western ("Silverado"); the Cult Film ("Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"); even a 
TV series (ABC's 1980 detective drama, "Tenspeed and Brownshoe"). 
</P>
<P>
Goldblum's tortured role as a decomposing man trapped in an insect's molecular 
structure in "The Fly" earned him his widest audience and talk of an Oscar 
nomination. In most films, Goldblum's roles can best be described as quirky. 
"That's OK," he said. "I like unconventional, I think." When asked if he was 
unconventional, Goldblum laughed. "In some ways. And in some ways conventional. 
</P>
<P>
"In my work, I think individuality and unconventionality and unpredictability 
and spontaneity are good qualities. That's the kind of acting I like to see and 
like to do." He drew in a deep breath. "But nothing weird, because I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Goldblum has no fear of doing TV movies. He won acclaim for A&amp;E's 1987 "The 
Race for the Double Helix," about the search for DNA. 
</P>
<P>
He says HBO's "Framed," which was shot in Paris, is the kind of theatrical 
quality independent film that is being passed over today in favor of bigger 
budget studio movies. HBO probably will distribute "Framed" as a feature film 
overseas, where audiences are more accepting of artistic fare. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not snobby about mediums, because I see bad movies -- movies that I 
wouldn't want to be in," Goldblum said. "And I see television things that are 
sometimes interesting and OK. So I'd rather be in the interesting and OK 
things, no matter what they are." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's not surprising that Goldblum and David Lynch are talking about 
doing a film together. Goldblum says they both share an interest in a 
flamboyant Yugoslavian-born inventor, Nikola Tesla (a unit of magnetic flux 
density was named after him). A script is being developed. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, or at least until his next acting assignment, Goldblum will teach 
acting at Playhouse West in Los Angeles, a passion he enjoys regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"Becoming an actor meant a lot to me growing up," Goldblum said. "By the time I 
was in high school, I needed to do it, and I prayed for it daily. I had to 
become an actor. There was a kind of salvation in it. I had to be saved."

<P>
THE MIND OF SOUTH AFRICA BY ALLISTER SPARKS (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $24.95; 424 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Caplan, Caplan is the managing editor of World Policy Journal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fashionable though it is these days to make presumptuous claims about the end 
of history, South Africa clearly testifies to the stubborn persistence of 
history -- to what the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre once described as 
"the past that weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living." It is the 
"deadly weight" of history, "the terrible tradition of a dialogue between 
master and servant," that Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National 
Congress, invoked on the occasion of the ANC's first meeting ever with the 
South African government last week. It is this same burden of history that is 
the subject of Allister Sparks' extraordinary book, "The Mind of South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
With eloquence and scholarly precision, Sparks, one of South Africa's foremost 
journalists, explores the "forces of history, culture, and circumstance" that 
have influenced the attitudes and interactions of his country's inhabitants -- 
from the Dutch Calvinists who came to the continent imbued with a sense of 
divine mission, to the British imperialists who exploited the country's vast 
economic potential, to the Africans, Indians and "Coloureds" who have always 
lived, in one fashion or another, beyond the pale. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks' account is highly selective. One learns little, for instance, about how 
the British came to acquire the Cape colony in 1795 and few details about the 
great Boer War they fought against the Dutch descendants, the Afrikaners, and 
how the British victory in that war led, perversely, to South African 
independence. Sparks leaves that task to others, instead concentrating on those 
aspects of events that might impart to readers familiar with South Africa's 
racism an understanding of how it came about and the difficulties that its 
legacy poses for the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Afrikaners are central to Sparks' story, as well they should be, bearing 
primary responsibility not for South Africa's racism -- that they share with 
the British -- but for the harshness of that racism. Their forebears, though 
largely social and economic washouts in 17th-Century Holland, saw themselves 
nonetheless as God's elect -- particularly in relation to the seemingly 
primitive heathen they encountered on the Cape. Over the course of the next 
three centuries, this self-image as God's chosen would harden into the fiercely 
chauvinist nationalism that is the underpinning of today's apartheid state. 
</P>
<P>
Critical to the development of that nationalism was the deep sense of grievance 
that the Afrikaners bore the British. Embittered by their loss of autonomy and, 
more important, by Britain's piecemeal granting of rights to people of color 
(blacks even enjoyed a limited franchise), the Afrikaners made their Great Trek 
to the "Deep North." But they could never migrate quite far enough; the 
discovery first of diamonds and then of gold brought them into renewed conflict 
with the expansionistic British, culminating in the Afrikaners' defeat in the 
Boer War. Even more searing than defeat, however, was the economic ruin that 
the Afrikaners faced in its wake, leading them to take the first steps toward 
institutionalizing segregation against blacks, their economic competitors -- a 
process that would intensify after World War II with the ascension to power of 
the ruling Afrikaner Nationalist Party. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot begin to understand the seeming intractability of South Africa's 
race problem today without an appreciation of the Afrikaner sense of grievance 
and isolation. Sparks goes so far as to confess to "being moved by the 
authenticity of the Afrikaner dilemma." He knows that, as an English-speaking 
South African, he is more or less at home in any part of the English-speaking 
world. Not so the Afrikaner. "He has the vulnerability of an endangered 
species. . . . He is portrayed by the world as a racist monster, and much of 
what the apartheid system does is indeed monstrous," but, Sparks asks, "would 
others have behaved very differently in his situation?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet at the same time, Sparks insists, no people has the right to build its 
nation on the deprivation of another's rights -- to restrict 75% of the 
country's population to 13% percent of the land, to enforce this restriction 
with acts of violent repression, and to cloak this repression in professed 
concern for the preservation of black racial and cultural identity. Sparks 
contrasts Afrikaner exclusionist nationalism with the vision of a nonracial 
society enshrined in the Freedom Charter of the African National Congress and 
concludes that Afrikaners -- now challenged as they have never been before -- 
must finally heed the injunction of history and accept the immutable reality of 
their multinational state. 
</P>
<P>
As well they have begun to do. And while Sparks' book was written before the 
dramatic moves taken by the South African government over the last three 
months, this in no way diminishes the value of his reflections on his country's 
future. His sober assessment of the fundamental issues dividing blacks and 
whites -- over group rights, the economic system, and political participation 
-- and of the serious differences among blacks themselves nonetheless leaves 
room for a considerable margin of hope. With the passion of a true patriot, 
Sparks looks forward to the day when his country ceases to be a symbol of 
racism, and instead of squandering its resources on hateful division is able to 
tap its potential as an engine of African economic development. It is Sparks' 
"dream for the new millennium" but it is a dream many others share as well.

Photo, "Now, as the profane past dies and the new South Africa waits to be 
born, we must look to African values on which to base it and to African figures 
to provide the leadership. . . . The big-hearted Nelson Mandela perhaps, or the 
rising Thabo Mbeki in the generation that will follow, or some other such 
figure. Nowhere have whites offered that kind of hand of reconciliation to 
blacks. It must be the other way around. Then the nonracial future can begin."

MAN BITES TOWN: BIG WHEELS; 
</P>
<P>
ONE JACKKNIFED 18-WHEELER ON THE 210 AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EAT DINNER COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY SHEARER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WE DON'T USUALLY do reader-participation gimmicks in this space, but the 
format's getting faster all the time, so here's a question for you: When was 
the last time you spilled a load of oranges on the 210 or several barrels of 
lightly irradiated fish oil on the eastbound Santa Monica? Since I have neither 
the time nor the technology to receive your answer, let me guess what it was: 
Never. Unless you happen to drive a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks play a major role in our lives, and you don't have to be a harried 
commuter to know it. Just listen to drive-time radio, and you'll hear the 
persistent mantras of Metro Traffic: an overturned big rig, a spilled load of 
something ludicrous or noxious, a jackknifed 18-wheeler and millions of people 
arrive late for work or eat dinner cold. 
</P>
<P>
Now, don't get me wrong. Well, get me wrong for just a minute; I'll wait. OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Now don't get me wrong. I bear no personal animus toward truck drivers, aside 
from the guy on "Twin Peaks," who should be arrested on charges of aggravated 
pouting. 
</P>
<P>
But just after World War II, somewhere in this country a big decision was made, 
and it's beginning to look like the wrong call. That decision was to change the 
century-old way that stuff was shipped from one part of the country to another. 
We went from being a railroading nation to being a trucking kind of place. 
</P>
<P>
It had cultural implications galore, of course. Railroads were good for the 
folk-music industry, while trucking has single-handedly (or 18-wheeledly) kept 
Nashville in business. Hobos have not fared well in the transition; it's hard 
to hop a refrigerated big rig. And the sound of the lonesome whistle late at 
night has been replaced by a less romantic rumble that, if you're considering 
buying a house near a freeway, brokers will always tell you is "just like the 
ocean." 
</P>
<P>
But the main impact has been on our ability to go hither and yon without 
simultaneously going haywire. And it does no good for the trucking industry's 
publicists to rejoin, as they always do, that truckers pay more than their fair 
share of highway user taxes. That's the point of the question back in Paragraph 
One. The industry probably calculates "fair share" without counting the untold 
hours of wasted time caused by the havoc that only trucks can haul in. 
</P>
<P>
OK, I'm in this far, halfway to being an added ingredient in Hoffa Stew, so I 
might as well press on. Railroading was a team venture, requiring the 
cooperation of a bunch of people to get the job done. Truckers are loners, 
cowboys without cows. Which is a better model for beating the Japanese? On a 
more mundane level, there is a steady increase in the amount of what is 
charmingly referred to in the haulage trade as "hazmat" (hazardous materials to 
us bystanders) being shipped from city to city, often in futile search of a 
final resting place. I'd rather have that stuff safely sequestered on two rails 
than see it sharing my roadbed. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, in the modern age, trucks are a necessary part of the transportation 
system -- if we had one. Rail spurs don't go everywhere, so there has to be 
some trucking to final destinations for everything from food to this fine 
newspaper to radioactive ooze. We will always enjoy the obstructed views and 
the diesel fragrance that only driving behind a huge truck can provide on our 
surface streets. Those are almost private pleasures, to be enjoyed one 
extra-wide-turn-slowing-two-lanes-of-traffic-to-a-crawl at a time. 
</P>
<P>
But freeways are what truckers use when they're making those long hauls, 
dragging out-of-season produce from one end of the country to the other and 
looking out for smokeys, or whatever they look out for these days. Maybe 
they're looking out for "Smokey and the Bandit 4"; I know I'd look out for it. 
</P>
<P>
And the freeways are where trucks make their most obvious and massive 
contribution to degrading the urban experience. Hey, I'm no radical. I'm 
probably the fairest person you'd ever want to know. So I'd never advocate 
outright banning from our freeways of anything with more wheels than a station 
wagon. What I suggest is simply requiring every truck driver who wants to use 
our big roads to sign a binding pledge: a no-spill, no-jackknife, 
no-dropped-load oath. As long as it's adhered to, brother, put the pedal to the 
metal and forget the double nickel. Violate it one time, and you're exiled to 
Exposition. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody else, I'll see you in the on-ramp car-pool lane. I'm the guy with 
Judy the Inflatable Love Doll in the passenger seat.

THE MIND'S EYE: ENGINES OF WAR MERCHANTS OF DEATH AND THE NEW ARMS RACE BY 
JAMES ADAMS (ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS: $19.95; 297 PP.; 0-87113-352-0)) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that communism's virtual collapse in Europe is helping us forget "the 
doomsday clock" and other dreadful Cold-War imagery, we are inclined to dismiss 
military correspondents such as James Adams of the London Times, who stares at 
us gravely from his jacket-cover photo, his hair wind-swept, as if from a 
recent mission covering the dangerous covert warfare described in these pages. 
</P>
<P>
We note the outdated nomenclature (America and the Soviet Union are described 
as the world's "two great countries") and the reporting that does not seem to 
have been updated since this book appeared in England earlier in the year. 
Adams tells us, for example, that a high explosive called Semtex, perhaps the 
world's most dangerous "engine of war," is manufactured only in Czechoslovakia; 
is Vaclav Havel's government likely to crack down on production?, we'd like to 
know, and if so, will other small countries be able to pick up the slack? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, though, we remain aware that these are merely quibbles which do 
little to undermine Adams' basic argument that new threats are appearing, not 
only from the A-bomb (now that Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu 
civilizations have it) but from what we might dub the C-bomb: chemical weapons. 
They are "the nuclear bombs of the Third World," Adams reports, and they range 
from cheap, virtually undetectable explosives such as Semtex to deadly 
genetically engineered weapons such as tularemia bacteria, only .077 an ounce 
of which can produce a cloud 325 feet high, covering six-tenths of a mile and 
infecting thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' grave mien is no doubt the product of his frustration at superpower 
blunders that have allowed developing nations to procure this high-tech 
weaponry (Stinger missiles sent to the mujahedeen, for instance, were later 
fired back at U.S. helicopters from Iranian gunboats) and of his outrage at 
First-World nations who wittingly help the arms merchants. 
</P>
<P>
The worldwide regulatory policy Adams says we need, however, will be a long 
time in coming, as one can see from Adams' own argument. He glibly dismisses 
developing nations who assert that they have as much of a right to possess 
nuclear weapons as the First World. But only a few paragraphs later, he 
inadvertently confirms the fears that have caused some of these countries to 
assert that right, claiming that "The West should not lower its guard (because) 
the unpredictable could happen, and the Soviets and Americans could confront 
each other over a modern missile crisis."

THE MIND'S EYE: CRESTED KIMONO POWER AND LOVE IN THE JAPANESE BUSINESS FAMILY 
BY MATTHEWS MASAYUKI HAMABATA (CORNELL UNIVERSITY PRESS: $17.95; 191 PP.; 
0-8014-2333-3)

<P>
It's difficult to find two cultures more dramatically different than America 
and Japan. While Americans in pursuit of the Dream will blithely slacken ties 
to extended family, the Japanese are preoccupied with winning respect within 
the family. While Americans celebrate promotions as symbols of money, prestige 
and freedom, the Japanese at least seem to accept them somberly, as burdens to 
be fulfilled. And while most Americans discreetly cloak their social standing 
in private bank accounts or isolated estates, the Japanese are constantly 
defining theirs in public: Few lines of Japanese can be spoken, for instance, 
without distinguishing between close and distant friends, responsible and 
immature relatives, macho and boyish men. 
</P>
<P>
In an America of lonely careerists and fragmented families, do we have 
something to learn from the tightly knit Japanese? Or does Japanese culture 
confine singular people in a straitjacket? Matt Hamabata, a third-generation 
Japanese immigrant, essentially answers "yes" to both questions in "Crested 
Kimono," a book where case studies as emotionally charged as Kabuki drama make 
up for the occasionally drab fieldwork notes that Hamabata the Haverford 
College sociology professor had to include. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to ingratiate himself in Japanese business families, Hamabata began 
his research by pretending to be a native Japanese; this was quickly belied, 
however, by tramps across "pure" white floor cushions at dinner parties and a 
reluctance to meet with potential marriage partners. "You are being fukoo," 
snaps one matchmaker, "undutiful to your parents." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Hamabata learned to manipulate his social position with remarkable 
precision: After being given a box of chocolates and $250 in cash, for example, 
he makes a long string of calculations and then buys a return gift valued at 
exactly $125; his friendship is thereby continued, but circumscribed. 
</P>
<P>
Hamabata's central point, nevertheless, is that most intimate social 
relationships in Japan cannot be manipulated with such facility; the Japanese 
are constantly compromising their own desires to avoid tensions that might tear 
at the social fabric. He interviews four young Japanese women, for example, 
whose duty to family confines them in marriages to insensitive, uncaring men. 
</P>
<P>
Hamabata tries to justify the system, dismissing Mitsuko's passionate love for 
George, for instance, by pointing out that she later fell out of love. Only 
family bonds are lasting, he argues, while "the inner, private life of 
emotions, although real, is ephemeral." It's an argument that astutely exposes 
problems with American marriages, where a union with another person is often 
seen as the only way we can become part of something larger than ourself. But 
it fails to acknowledge that Japanese culture might also have its shortcomings, 
such as an impersonal dating ritual that permitted Mitsuko to love George only 
from afar.

WHAT MEN GET AWAY WITH, JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW OF THEM;

<P>
MY LIFE AND DR. JOYCE BROTHERS A NOVEL IN STORIES BY KELLY CHERRY (ALGONQUIN 
BOOKS: $14.95; 221 PP.) 
</P>

By Judith Freeman, Freeman is the author of The Chinchilla Farm, a novel.

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine spending a few hours with one of your closest friends, talking about 
your life, discussing all the lovers who've disappointed you, revealing your 
unhappiness with therapists who have failed to explain to you why, in this 
culture of rapid, inexorable progress, you shouldn't feel a dislocation of 
spirit and personality. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of your confessional session, you disclose the story of your 
incestual family life. You discuss the inability of your parents to achieve any 
notable happiness, your brother's alcoholic destructiveness, your longing for a 
child and a mate. You speak of friends, of hopes, and of failures. You reveal 
yourself deeply, in other words, and you do so with biting wit and uncommonly 
frank self-analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the tone of Kelly Cherry's fourth novel, "My Life and Dr. Joyce 
Brothers," which has been subtitled, "A Novel in Stories." Each chapter in this 
novel could stand alone as a separate short story and has been given its own 
title -- such as "My Brother: A Biography," or "The Parents" and "What I Don't 
Tell People" -- and yet the sum total is a fluid, dove-tailing account of the 
plight of a middle-aged, unmarried woman named Nina who understands how the 
numbing jargon of self-help, so prevalent in our culture and epitomized by the 
philosophy of Dr. Joyce Brothers, can do nothing to alleviate a sense of 
deep-rooted alienation and loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
Nina, who narrates her own story in a confidential, intimate, wise-cracking 
voice, is a Southerner transported to Madison, Wis. Her lover, Cliff, has 
recently abandoned her for someone else and now sends her letters asking why 
they can't be friends, adding insult to injury. She has joined a survivors of 
incest group to help her come to terms with the bitter legacy of her brother's 
seduction. The most reliable, comforting presence in her life is a tiny dog and 
a friend named Rajan, of whom she writes, "America was full of Old Men 
pretending to be New Men and here was a New Man who didn't know it." Rajan can 
provide sympathetic friendship, but what Nina is really searching for is love. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what it is I am afraid of," Nina reflects, thinking of her lost lover 
Cliff. "If he never cared about me, really cared, then nobody has ever loved 
me. . . . If he didn't love me, I have been alone forever and that is how it 
will always be." 
</P>
<P>
Like a child afraid of abandonment, Nina worries that her future will be bereft 
of love and companionship. To her credit, she does not succumb to self-pity. 
Instead, much of the book is devoted to her analysis of how she has arrived at 
this point. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are all victimizers," she concludes. "They just can't stand to recognize 
that. Men tell women that 'No one can victimize you except yourself,' and the 
woman, upon hearing this, 'becomes tough and unvulnerable.' But 'The tougher 
women get, the more they get discounted.' That, unfortunately, is the catch 
22." 
</P>
<P>
As always, families have a great deal to do with the sorts of relationships 
that later ensue. The chapter on her brother explains how his sexual 
victimization of her accounts for many of her feelings: "In the beginning, my 
brother was the most wonderful man in the world. . . . When I grew up, I was 
going to be just like him, only female. When I grew up, I was going to be so 
beautiful that he would fall in love with me forever. I am not sure at what 
point he became unable to recognize that other people besides himself existed. 
He may have been born that way." 
</P>
<P>
By coming to terms with her brother, she faces her own complicity. Nina is such 
a generous, exuberant personality that even when she's taking men to account, 
there's a tremendously ironic wit at work: 
</P>
<P>
"We are such good little girls, all of us, reluctant to wreck our hopes for the 
future, no matter how unrealistic they may be, on the shoals of calling men to 
account for themselves. What they get away with, just because there are so few 
of them. Think of it: Women are waiting in line for the privilege of taking 
care of broken-down drunks like my brother. Anyone who doesn't think men get 
away with murder should remember that on 'Leave It to Beaver,' Beaver's last 
name was Cleaver. That made him Beaver Cleaver. What does this say to America?" 
</P>
<P>
Like many women her age, Nina feels the biological clock ticking away. She 
dreams of having a child but is unsuccessful at her attempt to become 
artificially inseminated. Yet toward the end of the story, Nina does obtain a 
baby when her brother's 13-year-old daughter, Babett, becomes pregnant, and the 
baby, when it is born, is handed over to Nina to rear. It's to Cherry's credit 
that she avoids wrapping up her story neatly with another happy ending that 
would have Nina paired off with the perfect New Man. 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago, D. H. Lawrence wrote that the future of the world wouldn't be 
determined between nations but in the relationship between men and women. I 
believe he was speaking of power, and of the subtle (and not so subtle) ways in 
which one-half of the world is subservient to the other. The tenuous ground 
between the sexes is littered with the corpses of those who did not survive the 
battle. But we keep plunging ahead, trying to achieve some kind of parity. In 
the process, many bitter tales are told. This isn't one of them. "My Life and 
Dr. Joyce Brothers," is far too witty, too savvy, too lyrical and compassionate 
to resort to bitterness. It's not an easy trick, but Cherry has performed the 
admirable feat of taking hackneyed fates and infusing them with tremendous 
freshness.

THE GREATEST SOLDIER-STATESMAN SINCE WASHINGTON; 
</P>
<P>
GENERAL OF THE ARMY GEORGE C. MARSHALL, SOLDIER AND STATESMAN BY ED CRAY (W. W. 
NORTON: $29.95; 847 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-393-02775-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark A. Stoler, Stoler is professor of history at the University of Vermont 
and author of George C. Marshall: Soldier-Statesman of the American Century 
(Twayne Publishers). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Catlett Marshall clearly ranks as one of the most extraordinary soldiers 
and statesmen this nation has ever produced. As World War II Army chief of 
staff he was, in Winston Churchill's words, the great "organizer of victory." 
As secretary of state from 1947-1949 he played a major role in the formulation 
of basic U.S. Cold War policies, most notably Containment and the European 
Recovery Program, which bears his name and led to his receipt of the Nobel 
Peace Prize. As secretary of defense during the Korean War, he helped to 
re-create U.S. military power while simultaneously reasserting civilian control 
over it in the Truman-MacArthur controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's character was even more impressive than his accomplishments. 
Contemporaries were awed not only by his leadership abilities, but also by his 
honesty, commitment to principle, self-sacrifice, and sense of honor and duty. 
He turned down power, profit, and historical immortality on numerous occasions, 
refusing to seek elected office, to accept lucrative offers for his memoirs, or 
to request command of the Normandy invasion that was his for the asking. Harry 
Truman considered him the "greatest living American." To Churchill, he was "the 
noblest Roman of them all." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agreed. Like any public figure, Marshall had his failures and 
detractors. Pearl Harbor occurred while he was chief of staff, and his 1945-46 
mission to prevent civil war in China did not succeed. His policies infuriated 
the "China Lobby" and the McCarthyites within the Republican Party, who went so 
far as to accuse him of being a "front man for traitors." Yet for most of his 
contemporaries, Marshall remained a figure of towering stature, comparable only 
to George Washington in the annals of U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few decades, however, Marshall's reputation has faded. Most 
college students today cannot identify him at all, save for the fact that he 
had "something to do with the Marshall Plan." As Roosevelt feared, people have 
remembered the battlefield commanders from World War II rather than the 
soldier/statesman who was their mentor and superior. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Cray, journalist, author, and associate professor of journalism at the 
University of Southern California, has attempted to rectify this situation with 
a one-volume biography of Marshall designed for the general reader. He is not 
the first to do so. Three other journalists have previously published popular 
biographies of Marshall: William Frye in 1947, Robert Payne in 1951, and 
Leonard Mosley in 1982. Cray's effort is far superior to all of these. Unlike 
the first two authors, he has the advantage of writing after the publication of 
Forrest C. Pogue's magisterial four-volume official biography and the first two 
volumes of Marshall papers as edited by Larry I. Bland. Unlike the third 
author, he has taken the time (nine years) to immerse himself in this and other 
relevant material, and to verify his conclusions with scholars. His numerous 
sources include unpublished as well as published documents, key secondary 
works, journalistic accounts of the time, oral history transcripts, and his own 
oral history interviews. The result is an accurate and judicious, as well as a 
highly readable portrait of a true American giant. 
</P>
<P>
Cray's title reflects his emphasis. "General of the Army" was a special, 
five-star rank created by Congress to recognize Marshall and a few others for 
exceptional service in World War II. Although he held two Cabinet positions 
afterwards and is most famous today for the Marshall Plan, the focal point of 
his career remains his extraordinary tenure from 1939-1945 as Army chief of 
staff. Cray properly devotes two of his four sections and more than half of his 
narrative, as well as his introductory chapter and title, to this six-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's basic character and ideas were of course formed long before 1939, 
and Cray's first section clearly traces his personal and professional 
development from birth in 1880 to the chief-of-staff appointment. Those years 
were marked by recognition of his exceptional abilities, but lack of 
appropriate promotion because of the small size of the Army and the fact that 
his genius at staff work prevented him from obtaining troop command. Not until 
1936 would he see his first star. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's exceptional managerial abilities would be critical in creating the 
largest Army in U.S. history between 1939 and 1945. Of at least equal 
importance in explaining his success during these years, however, was his 
capacity to grow intellectually throughout the war, despite his age, and 
consistently to assume more and more responsibilities. The most important of 
these were political in nature, for war is an instrument of policy and 
inseparable from political realities. Consequently Marshall found himself 
constantly dealing with congressmen, presidents, naval and allied counterparts, 
and leaders of other countries on a host of politico-military issues. So 
successful was he in these efforts that by 1945 he had become the President's 
most trusted adviser and one of the nation's foremost and respected diplomats 
as well as soldiers. His shift after the war from military to 
civilian/diplomatic posts, covered by the author in his fourth and final 
section, was thus far less dramatic and surprising than one would think. 
</P>
<P>
Cray is especially good in explaining the complex politico-military issues of 
the war years while keeping his subject in the foreground. His tightly knit 
narrative weaves together the numerous events that concerned Marshall from 1939 
through 1945 without losing track of the man himself. This is an impressive 
accomplishment for any writer, and especially for one not trained in history. 
</P>
<P>
That lack of training does reveal itself, however, in a few errors and 
omissions. Historians no longer describe the 1920s as an era of "deliberate 
isolationism," for example. On occasion, the author credits Marshall with 
questionable and undocumented beliefs, uses quotes improperly to describe 
preceding events, and provides incorrect first names and background 
information. Although extensive, the bibliography does not include a few 
pivotal works on strategy and diplomacy during World War II and the early Cold 
War, or some previously published studies of Marshall. Compared with other 
popular biographies of major World War II figures, however, this one is 
remarkably accurate and well researched, and highly recommended for the general 
reader. 
</P>
<P>
The Marshall Plan might have rebuilt Eastern Europe 40 years ago, had the 
Soviet Union not stood in the way. See excerpt from "General of the Army," 
Opinion section, Page 4.

MILOSZ AND THE GLEAM ON THE BLACK RIVER; 
</P>
<P>
THE ETERNAL MOMENT THE POETRY OF CZESLAW MILOSZ BY ALEKSANDER FIUT TRANSLATED 
BY THEODOSIA S. ROBERTSON (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: $25; 240 PP.; 
0-520-06689-8)

<TEXT>
<P>
Poets in America often suffer an exile of indifference, and it is hard to 
imagine why a poet would find widespread recognition unwelcome. Since winning 
the Nobel Prize in 1980, Czeslaw Milosz has become one of the best-known and 
most admired poets in the world but sometimes, he has found, for the wrong 
reasons. His celebrity grew at a time when Lech Walesa and Solidarity were 
changing Poland. The tendency has been to view him as a political poet, the 
poet of Poland and Polish independence, the poet of the Holocaust and, an 
epithet he particularly dislikes, the poet of the Polish diaspora. Milosz's 
relationship to Poland is to the culture and traditions embedded in its 
language, not to its contemporary politics: "I was not born in Poland, I was 
not raised in Poland, I do not live in Poland, but I write in Polish." 
</P>
<P>
Milosz's cultural allegiance is further complicated by the fact that he was 
born in Lithuania ("almost in the nineteenth century"), a country whose 
landscape and traditions are an important part of his imagination, and by the 
fact that much of his best poetry has been written over the last 30 years while 
living in Berkeley, where confrontation with American culture has left its 
mark. His complex criticism and admiration of Robinson Jeffers resulted in one 
of his most important poems and one of his recent collections, 'Unattainable 
Earth,' is a multiform work including numerous translations of Whitman. He is 
California's preeminent poet. 
</P>
<P>
Though Milosz has often described himself as a hermetic poet writing for a 
small audience, there is something embracing and large about his poetry. We get 
glimpses of his deepest concerns in his better-known prose works, particularly 
"The Captive Mind," and the novel "The Seizure of Power." While these are about 
the tyranny and degradation of both communist and fascist regimes, they are 
less about political situations and historical moment than about the human 
spirit as it creates and engages evil. Milosz asserts the necessity of a 
human-centered Christian imagination against the demoralizing forces of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that his poetry is the versification of theological ideas or 
philosophical arguments. But it does mean that he does not find aesthetics an 
adequate substitute for religion. Unlike many in the late 20th Century, he 
remains uninterested in Bloomian anxiety, Vendlerian aestheticism, Rortarian 
blithe pragmatism, and Foucaultvian rhetorics of oppression. Unlike Yeats and 
other modernists who sought new mythologies to substitute for the failure of 
religion, Milosz relies heavily on the mythology of the Fall and the 
possibility of grace and redemption. His genius resides in his ability to 
confront the demons of natural science, erotic obsession, and utopian political 
reform -- all that has made this the century of nihilism -- and posit against 
them a powerful symbolism of faith. 
</P>
<P>
Aleksander Fiut's, "The Eternal Moment: The Poetry of Czeslaw Milosz" is the 
first full-length study of the poet and goes far to describe the intricacies of 
his poetic vision. Written by a Polish scholar, the work gains much from the 
author's knowledge of the poetry in the original. Fiut is able to point to the 
variety of voices and tones, the tension between stylized and spontaneous 
speech crucial to understanding the drama and irony in Milosz's work. 
</P>
<P>
Fiut's discussion of the web of thought and feeling in Milosz's poetry gains in 
breadth and complexity what it loses in inspiration. The study suffers 
occasionally from too much discussion of theoretical problems without more 
careful attention to how they are made manifest in the individual poems. Fiut 
does outline the major coordinates of Milosz's imagination. Milosz's great 
preoccupation is the entanglement of the divine and the eternal with the 
worldly and the ephemeral. Fiut focuses on this tension as revealed in Milosz's 
attitudes toward nature and eternal forms, erotic and divine love, and history 
and providence. The title of the book, a phrase taken from an uncollected poem, 
"A Notebook: Bon by Lake Leman," appears on several occasions in Milosz's 
oeuvre. Fiut's elaboration of its meaning in the full context of the poet's 
work confirms Milosz's definition of poetry as "the passionate pursuit of the 
real." 
</P>
<P>
Pulled by the sensuous beauty of the earth, Milosz nonetheless finds nature 
annihilating to soul of man. The "eternal moment" must account for the world 
but transcend it: "Whoever finds order,/ Peace, and an eternal moment in what 
is/ Passes without a trace. Do you agree then/ To abolish what is, and take 
from movement/ The eternal moment as a gleam/ On the current of a black river? 
Yes." More than 30 years later, Milosz would conclude a farewell poem to his 
wife with an even more intense, apocalyptic affirmation of resurrection and 
eternal forms that moves beyond accepted icons of faith: ". . . Beyond the 
fire-curtain,/ A lamb stands in the meadow of indestructible forms./ The souls 
in Purgatory burn. Heraclitus, crazy,/ Sees the flame consuming the foundations 
of the world./ Do I believe in the Resurrection of the flesh? Not of this ash./ 
I call, I beseech: elements dissolve yourselves!/ Rise into other, let it come, 
kingdom!/ Beyond the earthly compose yourselves anew!" 
</P>
<P>
While Fiut describes Milosz's creation of an eschatological vision rooted in 
the Christian tradition, he gives too little attention to the crisis that 
fueled it. Milosz hated both fascism and communism for masquerading force and 
persecution under the guise of reform and purification. Following Simone Weil, 
Milosz found dialectical materialism a bankrupt conception of history that 
hides degradation, cruelty, and unrelenting struggle. The appeal of utopian 
history, such as superficial concepts of progressive evolution, rests in its 
secularization of divine providence. For Milosz, history without God is 
meaningless. On this issue, politics (though not political commentary) and 
religion intersect in Milosz's thought. The conclusion to his elaborate 
meditation 'Under the Wormwood Star" combines a vision of a world poisoned by 
supercession of tyrants and empires, possibly moving toward apocalypse: 'The 
planetary empire was at hand/ They said what was speech and what was 
listening./ The ash had hardly cooled after the great fire/ When Diocletian's 
Rome again stood glistening." Milosz often struggles to recover a vision of 
redemption for the multitudes of individuals lost and displaced by the chaos of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The hope Fiut finds in Milosz is in his inexhaustable desire to piece together 
from a range of styles, voices, perspectives, reticulated symbols and thoughts 
a vision of the real. He pursues a totality, a whole but refuses to arrogate to 
himself a consuming monolithic voice. Milosz becomes, as he calls himself, a 
"medium" through which a multivocal history speaks in ceaseless dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Milosz often invokes the rounded world of the child's imagination as the model 
of the eternal moment. One of his best lyric sequences, "The World," portrays 
the child's -- the individual's -- trust in the reality and permanence of the 
observable as a great testament of love and faith. They are songs of innocence 
written during the experience of Nazi occupation of Europe. Yet Milosz 
subtitles the sequence "A Naive Poem." What we feel in reading him is the 
ongoing conflict of an exile who has long desired but always deferred the 
building of a permanent home.

INITIATION

by CZESLAW MILOSZ 
</P>
<P>
Vanity and gluttony were always her sins 
</P>
<P>
And I fell in love with her in the phase of life 
</P>
<P>
When our scornful reason is the judge of others. 
</P>
<P>
Then I went through a sudden initiation. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did our skins like each other, tenderly, 
</P>
<P>
And our genitals fit once and for all, 
</P>
<P>
But her sleep at arm's length exerted its power 
</P>
<P>
And her childhood in a city she visited dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever was naive and shy in her 
</P>
<P>
Or fearful in the disguise of self-assurance 
</P>
<P>
Moved me, so that -- we were so alike -- 
</P>
<P>
In an instant, not judging anymore, 
</P>
<P>
I saw two sins of mine: vanity, gluttony.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ICE TIME CLIMATE, SCIENCE AND LIFE ON EARTH BY THOMAS

<TEXT>

In his compelling introduction to the science of climatology, Thomas Levenson 
explains the origins of the Earth's atmosphere and its evolution through 
biochemical processes. He traces the history of meteorology and climatology, 
emphasizing how the use of sophisticated computer models is increasing human 
understanding of global weather patterns, and concludes by describing the 
ominous effects of pollution and deforestation on world weather. 
</P>
<P>
An associate producer of "Nova," Levenson excels at translating complex 
problems into terms that the general reader can easily understand, including 
why each quarter-pound fast-food burger that someone consumes causes the 
destruction of up to 1,000 pounds of tropical rain forest biomass. After 
surveying the damage done to the Earth in recent decades, Levenson concludes 
that he chose to become an environmentalist because, "I do not want to define 
myself as one of those whose greatest monument is blight."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ASPECTS OF LOVE BY DAVID GARNETT (VINTAGE: $8.95)

<TEXT>
<P>
First published in 1955, David Garnett's short novel is a superficial bit of 
fluff that deserves to have been turned into a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
The skewed romantic polygon at the center of the story involves Alexis, a young 
British ne'er-do-well; Sir George Dillingham, his wealthy uncle, and Rose, a 
French actress who somehow rises from unknown to Great Star.

The reader never sees the intelligence or passion that would make Rose a 
celebrated actress: Her success is a contrivance that enables her to take 
lovers with the casual elan that French women invariably display in English 
novels. The male characters fare no better. Sir George has all the depth of a 
monomolecular film; Alexis, the idle drop-out, becomes a career Army officer 
for no apparent reason. His new discipline allows him to conceive a deep but 
chaste love for Jenny, the daughter of Rose and Sir George, and continue the 
romantic improbabilities unto the second generation perdue.

<TEXT>
<P>
Heroes from the comics have been filling theaters lately, but three Marvel 
comics super-guys are languishing very unheroically without production or 
distribution dates. 
</P>
<P>
* Already used in a TV movie, "Spider-Man" was announced for feature filming 
two years ago but is still in development at 21st Century Film Corp. Neil 
Ruttenberg is writing a script. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Pictures Entertainment -- which has a distribution agreement with 21st 
Century -- says there's "quite a bit of enthusiasm" at the studio about the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
* The already-filmed "Captain America" -- also from 21st Century, for release 
through Columbia -- sits on the shelf, possibly to be released in late summer 
or early fall. But a Columbia source was less optimistic, calling the picture 
amateurish and "unreleasable." 
</P>
<P>
* "The Punisher," based on the Marvel comic about a one-man anti-criminal death 
squad, was originally due in the spring of 1989. Starring Dolph Lundgren as the 
leather-clad title character, the picture got entangled in the sale of New 
World Pictures, which produced. 
</P>
<P>
Since sold to I.V.E., which plans an upcoming video release, the film will have 
its "U.S. premiere" July 8 during the L.A. Comic Book and Science Fiction 
Convention at the Shrine Auditorium. Convention organizer Bruce Schwartz says 
this will be the film's only 35-millimeter screening before its journey to 
video shelves. Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: STILL JUMPY AT 60 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Clint Eastwood is no spring chicken -- he's 60. He's got a thoughtful, serious 
film, "White Hunter, Black Heart," due out in mid-September from Warner Bros. 
So why is the graying filmmaker jumping back into action with "The Rookie"? 
</P>
<P>
Now shooting around San Jose, "The Rookie," due from Warner Bros. in December, 
teams a blue-collar cop (Eastwood) with a youthful yuppie cop (Charlie Sheen) 
in an LAPD grand theft auto unit. The film's publicist, Marco Barla, assures us 
that Clint will "be as active as ever," including plenty of chases and 
shootouts, with stunt doubles used for only the most hazardous stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But can the aging Eastwood compete with younger action stars? And why would he 
want to, after losing box-office steam with his last two tough-guy roles -- 
"The Dead Pool" (the "Dirty Harry" sequel grossed a so-so $38 million in 1988) 
and last year's "Pink Cadillac" ($11 million)? 
</P>
<P>
"It's simple," answers Barla. "He liked the ("Rookie") script (by Boaz Yakin 
and Scott Spiegel), and he liked the character, one of those old dinosaur types 
that fights the rules. That was enough." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, "Clint always jumps back and forth," the publicist points out. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rookie" will reportedly have a "Lethal Weapon" feel, in part due to a 
number of complex special effects/stunt sequences. One, now shooting on a 
stretch of freeway outside San Jose and already publicized, has Eastwood in 
pursuit of an 18-wheeler transporting luxury cars -- with Clint driving his own 
car atop the rig prior to a fiery crash. 
</P>
<P>
Another chase blasts through the San Jose airport, featuring a collision with a 
jet. Already filmed in Los Angeles, where most of the film takes place: a 
sequence in which Eastwood and Sheen drive a Mercedes 500SL out of a high-rise 
window onto the roof of an adjacent building, plunging through a skylight. 
</P>
<P>
"Does that sound dull?" asks Barla. "Or as if Clint's taking it easy?" Pat H. 
Broeske

"This isn't an anti-glasnost movie. It's not saying that we shouldn't trust the 
Russians. It's saying that we have to watch for the enemy, everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
That's how an insider describes "The Day Before Midnight" -- about the takeover 
of a U.S. nuclear missile silo -- which Kevin Reynolds ("The Beast") will 
direct for Universal Pictures. Ray Gideon and Bruce Evans wrote the script from 
the novel by Stephen Hunter. The film's producers include Sean Daniel, former 
Universal production president. Shooting is expected to begin in August. 
</P>
<P>
The plot involves a U.S. military officer who discovers a plot by a Soviet 
general to launch a U.S. missile in order to goad his countrymen into 
retaliation -- and a return to hard-line Communism.

. . . Will Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder do it again? We're told that there are 
discussions at Tri-Star about a fourth Pryor-Wilder comedy teaming, titled 
"Another You," and that Peter Bogdanovich is a possibility to direct. The 
actors teamed for last year's "See No Evil, Hear No Evil," as well as "Stir 
Crazy" (1980) and "Silver Streak" (1976). 
</P>
<P>
. . . Ever wonder who would win a battle between the monster from "Alien" and 
the title nasty from "Predator"? Look for the answer in "Predator II: Body 
Count" (due at Christmas), which features the predator's trophy case -- filled 
with the skulls of his human and inhuman victims, including one that's 
unmistakably that of the Alien.

WAGNER: "Das Rheingold." Marjana Lipovsek, Jadwiga Rappe, James Morris, Theo 
Adam, Heinz Zednik, Andreas Schmidt; Symphonie-Orchester des Bayerischen 
Rundfunks conducted by Bernard Haitink. 
</P>
<P>
EMI-Angel 49853-2 (two compact discs). The order may be jumbled, but the 
priorities are right: with his most recently published installment of the 
"Ring," Haitink capitalizes on the promise of the previously released "Die 
Walkure." What the conducting lacks in sheer, Soltiesque dazzle, it more than 
makes up in its adherence to line and respect for architecture, a symphonist's 
probing view of the score, animated by the Bavarians' accomplished playing and 
EMI's resourceful engineers. Morris' grainy bass epitomizes the callow young 
Wotan. Adam, a distinguished Wotan of yesteryear, brings uncommon intelligence 
and a tight top to Alberich. Noted, too, with pleasure: Lipovsek's steady 
Fricka, Rappe's opulent Erda, Zednik's wily Loge and Schmidt's Donner, a rich, 
baritonal, golden-age performance. ALLAN ULRICH

WEILL: "Die Dreigroschenoper." Ute Lemper, Milva, Helga Dernesch, Rene Kollo, 
Mario Adorf, Rolf Boysen; RIAS Chamber Choir and RIAS Berlin Sinfonietta 
conducted by John Mauceri. 
</P>
<P>
London 430 075. The second release in London's Weill project should satisfy 
both those who believe the composer belongs in the opera house and those who 
would consign him to the musical theater. Boysen's Ballad Singer sounds smarmy 
and slightly indecent. Dernesch's formidable mezzo relishes the Brecht text in 
the "Ballad of Sexual Obsession." Kollo's Macheath lends just the right note of 
skewed gallantry. Lemper's Polly (this version restores her the "Pirate Jenny" 
number) is insidiously demure, while Milva is a ferocious Jenny. Mauceri keeps 
sentimentality at bay while sticking with the printed score. Spoken passages 
are abridged; some verses are eliminated in order to fit "Threepenny Opera" 
onto one compact disc, but this is generally a performance that sizzles. Allan 
Ulrich

DONIZETTI and BELLINI ARIAS. Raul Gimenez, tenor; Scottish Chamber Orchestra 
conducted by Michelangelo Veltri. 
</P>
<P>
Nimbus 5224 (compact disc). Although already 39 years old, the Argentinian 
Gimenez is something of a newcomer to the international scene. He shows a 
somewhat smallish, tight voice, which nonetheless is used with color variety 
and sensitivity. The cruel demands at the top of the range in this repertory (a 
D flat in the "Puritani" and the respected C's in the treacherous "Fille" aria) 
hold no terrors for him. He is also capable of the seamless legato line 
necessary for "Una furtiva lagrima" and the "Pasquale" excerpts. Sympathetic 
accompaniment by Veltri. WALTER PRICE

HALEVY: "La Juive." Julia Varady, June Anderson, Jose Carreras, Ferruccio 
Furlanetto; Ambrosian Opera Chorus; Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Antonio 
de Almeida. 
</P>
<P>
Philips 420 190-2 (three compact discs). Sooner or later, Halevy's 1835 grand 
opera had to come to commercial disc, even, as here, in a somewhat cut version 
(which still runs over three hours). Passages of eloquent grandeur jostle with 
empty rhetoric for the attention as Scribe's libretto glazes the important 
subject of 15th-Century religious intolerance with a frosting of purest 
melodrama. Although Berlioz admired Halevy's orchestration, one comes away 
convinced that virtually every note is there for effect. Still, Halevy provided 
ripe opportunities for vocal display; they have been seized by Carreras' 
Eleazar, delivered with fervor and tenorial finesse; by Varady's poignant 
Rachel and by Anderson's glittering Princess Eudoxie. Almeida conducts with 
conviction and authority, virtues accomplished not easily in this work. 
Philips' sound is everything it should be. Allan Ulrich

POP EYE: 'DICK TRACY' SCORE LEAVES DANNY ELFMAN BREATHLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having a tough time figuring out which "Dick Tracy" album to buy? Or how many 
you can afford? 
</P>
<P>
Should it be the "Tracy" soundtrack, which is list-priced at $10.98 ($15.98 for 
CDs) and features 16 songs (though six of 'em aren't even in the movie, 
including Ice-T's "Dick Tracy")? 
</P>
<P>
Or should it be Madonna's "I'm Breathless" album, which also costs a steep 
$10.98 ($15.98 for CDs) and isn't officially a soundtrack, though it features 
songs "from and inspired by" the movie? Or should you wait till July 10 -- and 
buy the album with the original score (also $10.98/$15.98), which was penned by 
Danny Elfman, the pop wiz behind Oingo Boingo who scored "Batman" last year? 
</P>
<P>
If you can still afford to buy the score when it hits the stores, you're in for 
a surprise. According to Elfman, the score has two original music cues that 
were cut from the film during a very unusual last-minute editing session. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my score was finished, so I'd left to go out on the road and do 
concert dates with Oingo Boingo," said Elfman, taking a break from his work on 
a score for "Dark Man," a new film by horrormeister Sam Raimi. "Then I get this 
emergency call that Disney had totally changed the concept of the opening of 
the film. It was originally a long, long pan across the city, with my 'Tracy 
and Tess' romantic theme underneath. But when it didn't test well, someone -- 
either Disney or Warren Beatty -- decided to move the beginning along a lot 
quicker." 
</P>
<P>
With Elfman unable to fly back to oversee the changes, Disney sent him a video 
of the new opening credit sequence. Elfman then sat down in his hotel room and 
composed a new title sequence, experimenting with two different tempos to see 
which fit the new opening. After Disney received the changes, Elfman's 
conductor, Shirley Walker, got an orchestra together and played the new piece 
-- with Elfman listening to the entire performance, by phone, from his hotel 
room in Milwaukee! 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as our gig was over I rushed back to my hotel and listened to the 
session, trying to figure out which tempo sounded best," he said. "I guess it's 
a great story because now I'm hearing all these wild accounts, with people 
saying I was demanding they add a first violin or complaining that the cellos 
were too loud. That never happened. We had two different edits, so all I ever 
did was shout once in a while, 'Let's try the faster version!' " 
</P>
<P>
So what's it like working with Warren Beatty, a notorious perfectionist? "I 
took the job knowing there would be difficulties, so knowing that, there 
weren't many surprises," said Elfman. "Once you deliver the score, the composer 
has no real control -- that's the aggravating and frustrating part of the 
profession. The only thing that really kept Beatty and me apart was 'Batman.' 
He was apprehensive having someone so closely associated with that movie 
working on 'Tracy,' and I was worried about repeating myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we got that out of the way, we got along OK. Some of my cues got buried, 
but that happens a lot. I take it personally, but that's because I get so 
wrapped up in my work." He laughed. "Some people think it's unhealthy, but I 
don't know any other way to do it."

PLAY BALL: Chicago native Richard Marx will get a thrill July 10, when he 
returns to the Windy City to perform a special song at a special place. The pop 
star will croon the National Anthem at Wrigley Field, home of baseball's 1990 
All-Star Game. . . . And Peter Hook of New Order has a new band, Revenge, with 
a new album, "One True Passion" and a spicy new single, "Pineapple Face," a 
mocking tribute to deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
But you won't see the band's "Pineapple" video on MTV. The cable channel, which 
happily runs heavy metal clips featuring half-nude women writhing in bondage 
and submission poses, rejected "Pineapple" because it featured male band 
members with chastity belts around their necks. (Isn't that what Billy Idol 
wears in every video?)

HOT FLASH: Talk about timely. Just as 2 Live Crew is being prosecuted for 
making allegedly obscene rap records, Rhino Records is putting together a 
collection of lascivious R&amp;B gems that would bring a blush to the cheeks of 
pop morality crusader Tipper Gore (who frequently boasts about her love for old 
rock 'n' roll). 
</P>
<P>
Compiled by Rhino A&amp;R exec James Austin, the compilation, titled "Risque 
Rhythm," is due in September and features a host of of double-entendre classics 
that can be seen as the progenitors of today's raunchy rap hits. The 18-song 
package includes Bull Moose Jackson's "Big Ten-Inch Record," Tampa Red's "Let 
Me Play With Your Poodle," the Dominoes' "Sixty Minute Man" and Wynonie Harris' 
"Keep on Churning (Till the Butter Comes)."

GOING IN STYLE: Dead Boys' lead singer Stiv Bators, who was hit by a car and 
killed recently, was always a Doors fan. So much so, says I.R.S. Records 
(Bators' label), that Stiv, according to his wishes, was cremated and had his 
ashes spread on Jim Morrison's grave in Paris. . . . When Slaughter (who is 
currently on a nationwide tour with Kiss) hits Philadelphia for several dates 
beginning Tuesday, the band will skip the local hotel circuit -- and stay at 
the home of a die-hard fan, Dan Zimmerman, who invited the group to hang with 
him (at his parents' house, of course). 
</P>
<P>
When the group heard that the 19-year-old fan's house had a huge back yard, 
swimming pool and live-in gourmet cook, they said: 'Later, Holiday Inn!' 
Actually, the band members warned the family that they'd have a huge tour bus 
parked in front of the house, with five raucous roadies on board -- but the 
invitation stood. "It's gonna be great," said bassist Dana Strum. "The parents 
said they were looking forward to our visit."

THE REAL POISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found Patrick Goldstein's piece "Farrell Is Addicted to Not Covering Up His 
Covers" (June 10) extremely disturbing. I cannot believe what is happening 
concerning censorship. 
</P>
<P>
I was outraged when I went into a record shop a few years ago in search of 
Poison's "Open Up and Say Ahh" and instead of finding the original album cover, 
I found a "more suitable" version. The album cover was altered because the 
original version was allegedly "too satanic." 
</P>
<P>
I sympathize with Percy Farrell of Jane's Addiction. I do not think he should 
compromise by changing his original album cover in order to please the 
narrow-minded "moral majority." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative legislators and others are trying to limit my choices as a 
consumer and are undermining the constitutional rights of many artists.

GETTING DOWN TO BASICS WITH BEATTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beatty's cogent observation in Mathews' excellent bio article is timely: ". . . 
box-office grosses, film budgets and production problems demean films" and 
"box-office reports are promoting bad films." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the PR use of such statistics have become vulgar marketing tools. 
</P>
<P>
When I was young, I used to root for Hugh McElhenny of the San Francisco 49ers. 
My focus was on Hugh's awesome broken-field running. I didn't know his salary 
or even care. Today, ask kids about basketball star Michael Jordan. They'll 
fire off some stats at you, prefaced by the seven-digit figure of his enormous 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that some movie budgets are exaggerated to hype the box office. 
Whatever happened to quality for quality's sake? 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan is clearly a very great athlete. And Warren Beatty is a major 
talent in the entertainment world. Neither require "seven-digit hype" to sell 
their quality talents. 
</P>
<P>
The "bean counters" who dominate sports, Hollywood and our society today 
ultimately demean the Jordans and the Beattys.

The Pantages Theater gets a thumbs down. If you go to that theater holding a 
6-month-old, sleeping infant, you cannot enter. 
</P>
<P>
They send you back to the box office to buy another seat for the infant. 
</P>
<P>
We were there with our three children to see "Peter Pan," having already bought 
five seats at $37.50 each, which the Pantages would not exchange. Rather than 
disappoint the children and waste a lot of money, we had to buy the unusable 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
I asked why they would do this to patrons. They said "for insurance purposes." 
None of the staff could explain what this means. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance purposes or not, an infant must be held on someone's lap and is far 
too young to be a member of the audience. We wasted money on an empty seat at 
the Pantages.

DEATH TOLL IN IRAN QUAKE NEARS 29,000; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTER: RESCUE WORKERS STRUGGLED TO REACH SURVIVORS AS AFTERSHOCKS CONTINUED

Rescue workers and dazed survivors struggled Friday to dig thousands of dead 
and injured from the rubble of an earthquake in northwest Iran as the official 
death toll rose to nearly 29,000 -- the highest for an earthquake in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen towns and hundreds of villages were devastated by the temblor that 
spread across two provinces near the Caspian Sea early Thursday. Aftershocks 
continued to rock the area, with 140 counted by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross in Geneva, quoting the Iranian Red Crescent Society, said about 
400,000 people are believed homeless. The Iranian mission to the United Nations 
estimated that 100,000 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Whole towns were flattened like they were never there. We have no way to get 
to many," said Mohammad Afshar, a Red Crescent official. 
</P>
<P>
"For the next 10 days we will be digging through the rubble for corpses," 
Afshar said. "Roads are blocked by falling rocks, and planes have difficulty 
landing in the mountains of Gilan," a province on the Caspian Sea coast hit by 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported Friday that the known dead number 
28,950. It said 25,241 bodies have been counted in Gilan province, on the 
Caspian Sea, and 3,709 in Zanjan province. That toll surpasses the 25,000 
killed in Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and is the highest know worldwide 
since July, 1976, when a earthquake in China reportedly killed 242,000. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Geneva said it was told by the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry that the death toll was expected to reach 35,000, with 105,000 
people injured. A total of 28,198 people were injured in the two provinces, 
IRNA said. 
</P>
<P>
More shocks followed the big quake. Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri said a 
main road in the disaster zone, cleared Thursday, was blocked by a fresh 
landslide Friday. 
</P>
<P>
President Hashemi Rafsanjani visited the hardest-hit area, including the town 
of Roudbar in the Caspian province of Gilan, where at least 6,000 died. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Iran, fiercely proud of its self-reliance since 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1979 Islamic Revolution, would accept foreign 
help for quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said "nothing worth mentioning" was left of towns and villages he 
saw during a helicopter flight over the quake zone. Gilan province and 
adjoining Zanjan have a population of about 4 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Four of Iran's bitter enemies -- the United States, Israel, Iraq and Saudi 
Arabia -- sent offers to help. A senior U.S. official in Washington said the 
American offer was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"The catastrophe is so serious . . . " Rafsanjani told IRNA. "International 
help is needed. We should accept the help that is offered." 
</P>
<P>
He said the greatest need is for heavy equipment -- especially cranes to lift 
huge pieces of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Iran told the Swiss-based League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies that 
it needed medicine, tents, blankets, food, trucks, cranes and bulldozers. It 
said it did not need doctors and other experts or blood supplies, sniffer dogs 
or used clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian television showed doctors tending victims on stretchers in a makeshift 
hospital in a parking lot. Masked rescuers in white aprons pulled dust-covered 
bodies from under concrete slabs. Corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Television showed scenes of devastation, including the remains of an entire row 
of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims. They gently 
fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of stones and earth, only his 
head protruding. 
</P>
<P>
At Manjil in Gilan province, Parvin Nemati clutched the headless body of one 
daughter wrapped in a blanket. Her husband and relief workers unearthed the 
body of another daughter, 10-year-old Fatemeh, an Iranian correspondent 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
A man in Roudbar told Iranian television "a rock as big as a building" crashed 
into his home, killing four of his six children. His wife said she lay in the 
ruins for hours with one of the surviving children beside her. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a single house in this area which has been left standing," farmer 
Ali Mohammadi said in Roudbar. 
</P>
<P>
Television showed villagers looking at houses turned into heaps of mud bricks 
and wooden beams by the quake, which was measured at a magnitude of 7.3 by 
Tehran University; the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., put it at 7.7. 
</P>
<P>
Farhad Shad, a spokesman for the Geophysics Center at Tehran University, told 
IRNA that 140 aftershocks were registered after the killer earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals overflowed with victims. Tehran Radio said some of the injured were 
flown 600 miles from the disaster zone for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran airport was thronged with people trying to reach the quake zone to learn 
the fate of relatives. Officials turned them back, saying the planes were 
needed for relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
A French government plane carrying 205 rescue workers, 18 sniffer dogs and 25 
tons of aid was heading for Iran, although the Iranian Red Crescent said 
experts were not needed. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-member British team set out with ultrasonic listening devices and thermal 
cameras which can sense body heat beneath ruins. A planeload of doctors, rescue 
workers and aid was on its way from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Five members of the Paris-based charity Doctors Without Frontiers were already 
helping at an air force hospital in Tehran, IRNA said.

MANDELA THANKS U.N. FOR APARTHEID STANCE

<P>
Nelson Mandela, leader of the long-suppressed African National Congress, was 
given a rousing, historic welcome Friday to the United Nations, where he 
thanked the world body for its support in trying to abolish the "crime" of 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 spectators in the packed General Assembly Hall, many wearing 
their brightly colored native costumes, gave the deputy president of the ANC a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said apartheid "is a crime against humanity" and it is "appropriate 
that the international community should decide that it should be suppressed and 
punishment meted out against its perpetrators." 
</P>
<P>
"We pay tribute to this organization and its member states for this and other 
decisions and actions it took to expunge this crime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's whirlwind visit to New York moved into its third and final day with 
hardly a minute left unscheduled for the 71-year-old revolutionary. His 
undiminished and openhearted welcome from New Yorkers left cynical old-timers 
shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"My visit to New York has exceeded all my wildest expectations, from the 
response of the crowd and the response to requests that were made for resources 
to enable us to carry the program facing us," he told reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela hugged Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar when he stepped inside 
the U.N. headquarters. The two officials met privately for almost an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar called Mandela the "most popular man in town." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a hour, Mandela listened closely to the outpouring of praise and 
the pledges of continued support for his cause against apartheid by speaker 
after speaker at the General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar noted in his welcoming speech that South Africa's repression 
of its black citizens strikes "at the very heart of the U.N. Charter." 
</P>
<P>
"It embraces uprooting of people from their homes, mass deportions, harsh 
repressions and unjust practice based solely on race and color," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite violence inflicted on Nelson Mandela . . . . the messages he brings 
are peace and justice and the restoration of the inalienable rights of the 
people of South Africa," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela gave rare praise to the Pretoria government. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that President (Frederik W.) de Klerk and his colleagues in the 
leadership of the ruling party are people of integrity," he said. "We are of 
the view that they will abide by decisions that are arrived at in the course of 
our discussions and negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela praised the General Assembly's adoption last December of a declaration 
outlining steps to be taken to dismantle apartheid, including stepped-up 
economic sanctions on South Africa and financial assistance to southern African 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, the world community still has "some distance to travel" before 
the declaration would be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
At a taping later of a PBS program, "Meeting With Mandela," the ANC leader 
defended his support of Yasser Arafat, a stance that drew criticism from major 
Jewish groups in the city. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was "more astonished than surprised" by the slew of headlines in the 
local press about comments Thursday in which he praised the PLO leader's 
support of the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the only solution to the problem in the Middle East is peace and for 
the operatives to sit down and hammer out a solution," Mandela said. "The only 
solution is an agreement between the PLO and Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Mandela took his campaign against apartheid to the heart of 
Harlem and drew a thunderous ovation from a crowd of thousands with the ringing 
cry, "Death to racism!" 
</P>
<P>
From there he went to Yankee Stadium packed with about 55,000, where he donned 
a Yankee warm-up jacket and cap and proclaimed with a broad smile, "I am a 
Yankee!" 
</P>
<P>
He was scheduled to head to Boston and Washington over the weekend in his 
eight-city U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Mandela met in a private session with business leaders in the 
towering World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known what Mandela told the group, but in an interview 
with the New York Times Thursday, he said the African National Congress was not 
wedded to socialism and supports "state participation" in the South African 
economy only to the extent needed "to redress gross disparities in wealth 
between blacks and whites." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was believed to be an effort by Mandela to ease worries about the 
ANC's longstanding support for nationalization of important industries and over 
its alliance with the South African Communist Party.

UCSD STUDY FINDS STEROID CURBS AIDS-CAUSED ILLNESS 
</P>

<P>
An inexpensive steroid drug can halve the number of deaths each year from 
AIDS-related pneumonia, a study led by UC San Diego doctors has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The state-funded study, done at eight hospitals throughout California, found 
that the anti-inflammatory drug prednisone prevents the condition of 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia patients from worsening in the first few days 
after antibiotic therapy begins. 
</P>
<P>
The study was presented Saturday at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"What generally happens is that people continue to get worse for a few days 
after standard antimicrobial therapy begins. The median time to improvement is 
four to six days," said Dr. Samuel A. Bozzette, a UCSD assistant clinical 
professor of medicine who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
It is during this continued drop in their breathing capacity that many 
Pneumocystis patients die. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an important study, that it will save lives -- not in the dozens, 
but in the thousands," said Dr. J. Allen McCutchan, another UCSD investigator 
in the study. 
</P>
<P>
Pneumonia from Pneumocystis, a bacterium, is the most common opportunistic 
infection striking AIDS patients in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 people with AIDS become ill with Pneumocystis every year, and 
about 15% of them die from the infection, McCutchan explained. That means at 
least 3,000 would be saved from death by the prednisone treatment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Its results are so striking that doctors involved in the study already have 
adopted steroids as their standard therapy for moderate to severe Pneumocystis 
patients, Bozzette said. 
</P>
<P>
The results also are being considered by a National Institutes of Health 
consensus panel on AIDS treatment, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike research with other drugs, there is little financial gain at stake for 
drug companies,Bozzette said. A month's supply of prednisone for Pneumocystis 
therapy would cost about $10. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a study for which drug company sponsorship was impossible. There's no 
money to be made from this," Bozzette said. "Corticosteroids are generic. 
They're about as expensive as potting soil." 
</P>
<P>
The research was done by the California Collaborative Treatment Group, a 
state-funded AIDS drug-trial cooperative intended to address AIDS therapy 
questions considered important to California. Cooperating institutions are 
UCSD, the University of Southern California, UC Irvine and Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the four centers conducted the trial on 333 people with AIDS, 
142 of them at UCSD, who were treated for moderate-severity Pneumocystis at 
eight different hospitals throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the patients received prednisone within 36 hours of the onset of 
antibiotic therapy, and the others received only antibiotics. (However, 
patients in the antibiotics-only group who showed signs of oxygenation failure 
were given prednisone immediately.) 
</P>
<P>
In the antibiotics-only group, 23% were dead within 31 days of treatment 
beginning. In the prednisone group, 11% were dead within 31 days. 
</P>
<P>
After 84 days the difference was smaller: 26% of the antibiotics-only group had 
died by then, and 16% of the prednisone group had died. 
</P>
<P>
Importantly, Bozzette said, there was no significant difference in recurrence 
of Pneumocystis between the survivors in both groups. Some doctors had been 
concerned that prednisone, because it is known to suppress the immune system, 
would make AIDS patients more likely to get pneumonia again. 
</P>
<P>
"The clinical model and perception was that steroids are immunosuppressive and 
should be reserved for those people who get very, very ill," McCutchan said. 
"We looked very carefully (for harmful side effects). There were a few minor 
problems, but they were more easily treated (than Pneumocystis)." 
</P>
<P>
Other principal investigators in the study were Fred Sattler, USC; Joseph Chiu, 
UC Irvine; Daniel Gluckstein, Kaiser-Sunset Hospital in Los Angeles; and Carol 
Kemper, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Bozzette speculates that the prednisone keeps lung function from deteriorating 
in the pneumonia patients by stopping the lungs' inflammatory response to the 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start treatment you break up the organisms, and this causes 
inflammation of the air spaces in the lungs," he said. "The air spaces are 
filled with inflammatory fluid, and the little thin membranes through which 
oxygen is absorbed are swollen."

40 YEARS LATER, KOREA REMAINS A DIVIDED LAND

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a Sunday morning 40 years ago, North Korea sent thousands of troops across 
the 38th parallel into South Korea, starting a war that killed more than a 
million people, including 54,000 American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only war the United States has entered in this century that remains 
unresolved. The Korean peninsula, divided after World War II, still is split 
between the communist North and the capitalist South. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion stunned and enraged the West. The North Koreans occupied Seoul, 
the South Korean capital, in three days and overran most of the southern half 
of the peninsula in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen nations sent soldiers to fight for South Korea under the U.S.-led 
United Nations Command. Twenty-five others provided medical aid, food and 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
China, with war just across its border, sent hundreds of thousands of soldiers 
to help the North. 
</P>
<P>
When a cease-fire took effect 37 months later, the losses were staggering: an 
estimated 2.4 million soldiers and 4.4 million civilians killed or wounded. 
Military dead totaled more than 800,000. A land of remarkable beauty lay 
ravaged, treeless, burned and barren. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean War was a traumatic chapter in American history and its impact on 
succeeding generations has been profound. 
</P>
<P>
It was an inglorious war without victory, often nearly forgotten, patched into 
history between World War II and Vietnam. No peace treaty has been signed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a war in which we turned the tide against communism for the first time, 
in a victory regrettably sometimes ignored by history," President Bush said at 
a dinner for veterans of the war. 
</P>
<P>
Korea was the first confrontation of the big powers in the nuclear age. It 
intensified hostilities between East and West, and spurred a U.S.-Soviet arms 
race that only now is ending. 
</P>
<P>
From it grew the notion that communism in East Asia could be contained with 
help from the U.S. military. That led to American intervention in Vietnam a 
decade later. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years after the battle, North and South Korea watch one another from 
behind barbed wire and concrete bunkers on either side of a demilitarized zone 
2 1/2 miles wide and 155 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
The single telephone line between them is in Red Cross offices. There is no 
mail, radio or television communication, no direct travel without the 
permission of both governments, which is hardly ever given. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 9,000 American military personnel still are unaccounted for or listed as 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in a gesture seen as a political overture to Washington, North 
Korea returned what it said were the remains of five American soldiers. It was 
the first such action since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
The American Korean War Veterans Assn. says it has reports from witnesses 
indicating that some Americans still may be alive in North Korea or other 
communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic dialogue has occurred between the Koreas over the years, but little 
progress has been made in lessening tension, mutual suspicion and distrust. 
They have accused each other of more than 1 million violations of the armistice 
agreement, an average of 75 a day since the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
Reunification of the peninsula, long a dream of Koreans on both sides, remains 
elusive. 
</P>
<P>
The United States keeps 43,000 soldiers in South Korea to deter another 
invasion. There are plans to reduce the number, but some U.S. forces are 
expected to remain indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
For Washington, the conflict of 1950-53 was a war in which the politicians 
wrenched control from the generals. It is remembered as much for President 
Harry S. Truman's firing of Douglas MacArthur as for the general's bold 
strategy of pushing the enemy back with an amphibious landing at Inchon, a 
western port. 
</P>
<P>
Historians divide the Korean War into the first year of dramatic, far-reaching 
maneuvers and the next two years of static, positional battle. 
</P>
<P>
Americans were not prepared mentally or physically for a war fought in foxholes 
and trenches on rugged, mountainous terrain that was freezing in winter and 
scorching in summer. 
</P>
<P>
No place was so cold, so dirty. Grease from a hundred C rations was frozen to 
parkas and gloves. Underwear wasn't changed for months. Perspiration in boots 
turned to ice in winter. Blood froze on wounds before it could coagulate. 
</P>
<P>
Men fought hand-to-hand for small pieces of territory called Punchbowl, 
Hamburger Hill, Heartbreak Ridge, Bunker Hill. Each changed hands many times. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million men and women served in the American forces. Their 
casualties were 103,284 wounded and 54,246 dead, including 33,629 killed in 
combat. The infantry bore the brunt of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a crusade to save South Korea from communism enjoyed only brief 
public popularity. Soldiers returned home not to a hero's welcome, but to a 
public dissatisfied with an unpopular, unsatisfactory war. 
</P>
<P>
Weary soldiers, disheartened and dispirited, faded into the placid, prosperous 
American society of the 1950s, keeping their pain to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Not until Vietnam veterans received public attention did the Korean vets begin 
to organize. They formed an association five years ago and are trying to raise 
$10.5 million for a memorial. Korea is the only war without a memorial in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the war is called the 6-25 incident, reflecting the date it 
began and the Korean preference for numbering rather than naming events. 
</P>
<P>
Some South Koreans feel shame that the country needed help to defend itself and 
the anniversary is not a cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Many people who remember those days remain deeply grateful to the Americans. 
Monuments have been built in rice paddies and town squares to all nations that 
sent soldiers and aid. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between South Korea and the United States has changed 
dramatically in the last 40 years. South Korea's booming economy and growing 
pride in its own accomplishments make it less tolerant of pressure from 
Washington on economic, trade and political issues. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-American sentiment continues to grow. Visiting Korean-Americans say 
relatives and others scold them for wearing American-style haircuts and 
clothes, and for speaking Korean with American accents. 
</P>
<P>
Most Koreans disapprove of militants who burn U.S. flags and shout, "Yankee go 
home," however, and polls indicate they want American troops to remain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Korea, historically one land was divided into two countries after World War II 
as part of the breakup of the Japanese empire. Japan had occupied Korea since 
the early 20th Century. After the partition, the Soviet Union dominated the 
northern section, the United States the southern section. The Soviet Union 
refused to sanction elections in 1948 that would have unified Korea. Separate 
governments evolved in each section that remain to this day.

INDIANS' WATER OPENS FLOOD OF CONFLICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the arid West, where water is more valuable than gold, the Wind River Indian 
Reservation considers itself awash in wealth. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians last year won rights to much of the water in west-central Wyoming. 
Now their destiny is no longer entirely in the hands of the white man, who 
relegated them to the 2.5-million-acre reservation in the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
"Look how many years we've taken the back seat to everything," said Burton 
Hutchinson, Northern Arapaho tribal chairman. "We're the ones in the driver's 
seat now. It feels good. Real good. Real nice." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled that an 1868 treaty gave the Northern 
Arapahos and Shoshones priority rights to 500,000 acre-feet of water from the 
Wind River -- roughly twice what the 6,000 Indians previously controlled. An 
acre-foot is enough to cover an acre to a depth of one foot. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Indians hope to attract tourists and anglers to the 
river by maintaining the flow rather than diverting water to irrigation in dry 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see the day when every tribal member who wants to work can," said 
Wes Martel, co-chairman of the Shoshone Business Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see the day when everyone on the reservation who wants an education 
can get one, when the elders can get the medical care they need and when the 
reservation stands out as an example of what can be done when people can plan 
for the future," he added. "And this water is the key to all of that." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Indians' new-found wealth has brought them into conflict with 
non-Indian farmers on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
In the past Indians and non-Indians shared water in dry times. But after the 
Supreme Court ruling, the tribes began making sure their water rights were 
observed before sending water to the non-Indian farmers, some of whose 
ancestors homesteaded the area with federal assurances they would have water. 
</P>
<P>
In early May, when runoff was scarce, the tribes shut off water to about 30 
non-Indians in a section that relies on canals for water from the Wind River. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty frustrating to watch your sprinkler sit there idle while your 
neighbor sits there and uses 12,000 gallons of water to irrigate land covered 
mostly with foxtails," said Fran Fox, a non-Indian farmer. 
</P>
<P>
"Each day you watch water go down the river that should be in your canal," said 
another farmer, Tim Shell. "Before this started, we shared water by rotation 
and we all survived. The rules have changed now. Some are prospering and some 
will be a lot worse off." 
</P>
<P>
To alleviate disputes last year, the state paid the tribes $5.3 million to 
secure water for the non-Indian irrigators. 
</P>
<P>
But efforts to reach another agreement for this year broke down in February, 
with the state saying the price the Indians were asking was too high. 
</P>
<P>
Reservation hydrologist Catherine Vandemoer said the Indians are not obligated 
to give the non-Indians any water at all. And she said that runoff will 
increase, providing enough water for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be fine the rest of the summer," she said. "These people really have 
nothing to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
But the non-Indian farmers complain that the lack of water has already cost 
them barley and hay. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about 65 to 70 bushels (of barley per acre) as opposed to 100," 
Fox said. "My hay will be less than half of a crop." 
</P>
<P>
Non-Indians on the reservation "have no representation; we are 
disenfranchised," Fox said. "We are feeling a little lonely." 
</P>
<P>
Martel said the Indians are trying to manage the water in a way that will 
improve the reservation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to do something to alleviate the 70% unemployment and provide health 
care for our people who are not getting it," Martel said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have such potential, things here would be a little depressing. We 
are just trying to protect what little we have left."

TAXPAYER FINDS THAT TAXES WEREN'T CERTAIN BUT LEGAL EXPENSES WERE

Frank Rickel won his battle with the Internal Revenue Service -- but he lost 
more than he was fighting over. 
</P>
<P>
Rickel says he spent $28,000 more in legal fees than if he had not fought the 
IRS. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly five years Rickel battled the IRS over an age discrimination 
settlement the government wanted to tax. 
</P>
<P>
Rickel fought all the way to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in 
Philadelphia, which in April ruled in his favor. The court ruled that an older 
worker who wins damages from his employer because of discrimination does not 
have to pay taxes on the award. 
</P>
<P>
But Rickel estimates that the battle over $60,000 in taxes cost him $88,000 in 
legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
"These people at the IRS kept telling me I couldn't afford to fight them," 
Rickel said. "They were right." 
</P>
<P>
Rickel was fired as general sales manager from the Malsbary Manufacturing Co. 
in Uniontown in 1979 at age 59. He said he was told by his boss the company 
wanted a younger man in the job. 
</P>
<P>
Rickel sued Malsbary and its parent, Carlisle Corp., for age discrimination in 
U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh. Malsbary offered Rickel a $180,000 
settlement as a jury was deliberating in 1983, and he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I probably could've gotten more," Rickel said. "But the company 
probably would have appealed it on and on." 
</P>
<P>
Rickel, who holds a master's degree in economics from Kansas State University, 
said the way he read IRS regulations, court settlements for damages were 
excluded from federal income taxes. He did not report an $80,000 payment from 
Malsbary in 1983 or a $25,000 payment in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But the IRS contended payments made in age discrimination cases were taxable. 
</P>
<P>
A tax court ruled that one-half of the money paid to Rickel was taxable and the 
rest was excluded. The federal appeals court reversed the tax court ruling and 
said the entire payment was exempt from federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But the court denied Rickel's request that the IRS pay his legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of justice is that?" Rickel asked.

CHINA GEARS UP FOR WORLD'S LARGEST HEAD COUNT IN JULY; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS: AN ARMY OF 7 MILLION IS RECRUITED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE POSSIBLE 
IS INCLUDED IN A TABULATION EXCEEDING 1 BILLION.

<P>
How does a country count more than 1 billion people -- especially if many don't 
want to be counted? 
</P>
<P>
China has started by drafting nearly 7 million census workers, more than the 
entire population of Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of training centers have been set up to teach the workers 
how to conduct the world's biggest head count, which begins July 1 and will 
take about 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, millions more Chinese have been mobilized to hang red banners in 
the streets, beat drums, sing songs and hand out publicity materials to 
popularize the slogan, "The population census -- everyone is responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese have responded with the passive acquiescence they give all 
government campaigns, such as those calling for killing flies or studying 
socialist labor models. 
</P>
<P>
But the census, last held in 1982, strikes fear in the hearts of a substantial 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
They are the millions of people who have moved to cities without permission, 
and millions of others who have violated family planning regulations by having 
more than one child. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful of being fined thousands of dollars, parents often fail to register 
additional children and try to keep them deep secrets -- hence their nickname 
"black children." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very possible that there's a black child in each (apartment) building," 
said census worker Zhang Yuesi, who was taking part one recent afternoon in a 
pre-census trial in northeast Beijing's Zuo Family Village neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
She and five other workers visited three households and filled out 
questionnaires as a practice run. 
</P>
<P>
"We must deeply arouse the masses and do propaganda work among them" in order 
to get a correct count, said Zhang, a brisk woman who usually works in the 
municipal statistics bureau. Like other census workers, she was temporarily 
drafted in March to help make the count. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials insist that they won't punish anyone for having more than one 
child or living illegally in a city. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent news conference, Zhang Sai, deputy director of the central 
government's census "leading group," or committee, promised that data on 
individual families won't be shared with police or family planning officials. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not the census questionnaire per se that worries some families. 
</P>
<P>
It is the prolonged glare of official attention, including pre-census checks of 
household registrations -- little booklets that list household members. One 
copy is kept at home, and one in the local police station. 
</P>
<P>
Since spring, officials already have made door-to-door checks to confirm that 
registrations are up to date and have quizzed neighbors about suspect 
households. If there were any "black children" in Zuo Family Village, they 
likely were uncovered during this stage, when there was no confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuesi, the census worker, didn't want to release figures for her own 
turf. But she disclosed that in Fengtai, a rural area of Beijing, more than 300 
unregistered children were found "in just one census district." 
</P>
<P>
Li Honggui, deputy director of the national census office, said some have 
speculated that the nationwide total of "black children" will reach several 
tens of millions. 
</P>
<P>
The last census, in 1982, counted 1.03 billion people, and registered births 
and deaths since have produced a tentative count of 1.112 billion, making China 
by far the most populous country in the world. 
</P>
<P>
India is No. 2 with 880 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang Sai said an exact figure is needed for the smooth running of China's 
planned economy. That's why census takers are going door to door this year, 
instead of asking residents to visit census stations as in the other three 
counts made during four decades of Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Computers are playing a bigger role, too, replacing the abacus. First results 
will be released in October, and a detailed tabulation in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Our standard is to be off by no more than one-thousandth," said Zhang Yuesi, 
who is not related to Zhang Sai. 
</P>
<P>
Peculiarities of China's housing allocation system have created pitfalls that 
will test even the best-prepared counter. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Liu Yugui, a retired union official in Zuo Family Village's 
East No. 10 Building. His household registration book shows five people living 
in a two-room apartment. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, his son, daughter and grandson have found unofficial housing 
elsewhere. But they often visit and spend the night, Liu said. Where should 
they be counted? 
</P>
<P>
There are other special cases. Families swap assigned apartments, trying to 
move closer to work. Grown children marry outside Beijing but stay registered 
with their parents, hoping one day to return to the capital. Double-counting 
seems as much a risk as missing heads. 
</P>
<P>
But most problems can be resolved with a simple rule, Zhang said: People will 
be counted at their place of registration unless they've lived somewhere else 
more than one year.

<P>
When George Vanderbilt first visited North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains more 
than a century ago, he envisioned living there in a country estate in the 
tradition of the chateaus of France's Loire Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By 1890, the wealthy grandson of one of America's foremost entrepreneurs, 
Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, had acquired more than 125,000 acres of forest 
around the city of Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
Five years and untold millions later, the 33-year-old bachelor moved into his 
lavish 250-room Biltmore Estate. With four acres of floor space, the limestone 
mansion remains the largest private home in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Biltmore remains in the hands of the family today, but no one lives there. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, William A. V. Cecil -- Vanderbilt's grandson who grew up in the 
mansion -- is host to more than 700,000 visitors a year who pay nearly $20 each 
to step back in time and see how the rich and famous lived during the Victorian 
Era. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil, who returned to the Biltmore 30 years ago, depends on those visitors to 
cover the expenses of maintaining the estate. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil and his staff have gone to painstaking efforts to make sure the home 
looks as if the Vanderbilts still live in it today. 
</P>
<P>
An art lover, Vanderbilt filled the home with 70,000 objects, including 16th 
Century Flemish tapestries, a chess set once owned by Napolean and paintings by 
Renoir and John Singer Sargent. 
</P>
<P>
"The collection is very eclectic," said curator Susan Ward. "It represents his 
own tastes rather than following the trends of the times. The books in the 
library were ones in which he was interested." 
</P>
<P>
Outside, the formal French and Italian gardens and the grounds would still 
please the eye of landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed 
New York's Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
When he died, Vanderbilt gave most of the undeveloped land to the federal 
government, and it became the Pisgah National Forest. Today, the house stands 
on about 250 acres of gardens, parklands and woods. 
</P>
<P>
The estate also has a working winery, which opened in 1985. But it's George 
Vanderbilt's country estate that pulls in tourists from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Passing through the front gate, it takes several minutes to drive up the 
twisting approach road though thickets of pine, dogwood and rhododendron. The 
charming, 3-mile roadway was designed by Olmsted to give Biltmore's visitors a 
sense of anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
The first impression of the house is overpowering. The four-story limestone 
French Renaissance chateau rises from its perch in front of majestic Mt. 
Pisgah. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt, a scholarly man who spoke eight languages, combed the countryside 
of France before deciding on an architectural style for his dream home. 
</P>
<P>
On his journey, he took along his friend, Richard Morris Hunt, who was the 
first American to receive a degree from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt decided the house would be in the tradition of the great 
16th-Century chateaus of France, which were known as a Francis I style. 
</P>
<P>
"Vanderbilt was very involved in every aspect of the house," Ward said. "He's 
seen in every photo taken during the construction." 
</P>
<P>
Construction was slow and expensive. Vanderbilt put in a railroad spur to cart 
in hundreds of tons of Indiana limestone. Oak was shipped in and milled on the 
site. Bricks were made from clay found on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
After five years, the Biltmore opened on Christmas Eve in 1895. Vanderbilt 
himself took the presents from the 40-foot-high tree to give to his family, 
friends and servants. 
</P>
<P>
Today, gargoyles and cherubs carved out of the limestone greet guests at the 
Biltmore's front door, which opens into a large marble entrance hall. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately to the right is the winter garden, with its assortment of flowers, 
palms and ferns getting plenty of sunlight through its greenhouse-style roof. 
</P>
<P>
A statue of a boy and geese by Austrian sculptor Karl Bitter is the garden's 
centerpiece. The winter garden was the setting for the 1924 wedding luncheon 
for Vanderbilt's only daughter, Cornelia. The luncheon was attended by 1,000 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked around the corner is the bachelors' quarters, where unattached male 
guests could play billiards and smoke cigars under enormous animal trophies. An 
interesting feature is the set of hidden doors that blend into the wood 
paneling. 
</P>
<P>
In every room, the Vanderbilt family crest -- acorns and oak leaves -- can be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its 72-foot ceiling and dining room table that seats 64 guests, the 
acoustics in the banquet hall are so good that conversations can be held from 
opposite ends of the room. 
</P>
<P>
The only portrait of Vanderbilt hangs in the tapestry gallery, where three 
large 16th-Century Flemish tapestries are on display. 
</P>
<P>
The next room was the owner's favorite -- the oak-lined library with its 22,000 
volumes and an enormous Pelligrini painting that covers the entire ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, Vanderbilt's south bedroom offers a spectacular view of the grounds, 
with the French Broad River and Mt. Pisgah in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Down the hall is the oval-shaped bedroom where Vanderbilt's wife, Edith, slept. 
It's decorated with Louis XV-style furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
It takes several hours to tour the Biltmore, which has 32 bedrooms, a heated 
indoor swimming pool, a bowling alley and a gymnasium. Downstairs is the 
kitchen and quarters for the estate's 80 servants. 
</P>
<P>
The Biltmore was equipped with the most modern conveniences of the day, 
including indoor plumbing, central heating, refrigeration and electricity. 
</P>
<P>
In hopes of making the estate self-sustaining, Vanderbilt opened a dairy, 
cultivated grapes for wine and grew crops for his cattle and horses. 
</P>
<P>
Crops are still grown near the French Broad River, which flows on the southern 
edge of the grounds. The vineyard is located just across the river. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil says the biggest challenge right now is finding ways to handle all of the 
people who want to see the house. Parts of the house that had never been seen 
by the public have been opened in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the challenge is retaining the Biltmore's charm with its growing guest 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather didn't expect 700,000 friends a year flushing his toilets," 
Cecil said.

As much as 40% of a special tax benefit for low-income families with children 
is being claimed by ineligible people, the Internal Revenue Service estimated 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its audit program, the IRS found that in 1985, $818 million of the 
total $2.1 billion earned-income credit went to those who were found to be 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Credits totaling $6 billion are expected to be claimed this year by more than 
10 million working families. 
</P>
<P>
The credit was enacted in 1975 to reward low-income workers who hold a job 
rather than rely solely on welfare benefits. At that time, the credit was 
viewed as basically an offset against Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
For 1990, the credit is for 14% of the first $6,810 of wages and other earned 
income, a maximum benefit of $953. The credit drops as wages rise, and is 
eliminated once income reaches $20,264.

COLD WAR ENDING FOR SOVIET ICEBREAKERS;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers wanting to witness an offbeat ending of the Cold War can book a trip 
to the North Pole on a Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
The icebreakers, rarely seen in the West except on spy-satellite photographs, 
are starting sightseeing trips to the pole and may soon be guiding convoys of 
Western cargo ships through the Arctic wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
With a sauna, indoor swimming pool, sports hall, theater and library, 
icebreakers such as the 52,000-horsepower Taymyr are among the most luxurious 
places in the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
"But life is tough on board," Capt. Nicolay Krylov, 42, told reporters on a 
recent visit to the Taymyr, one of the Soviet Union's six nuclear icebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
"You work almost all the time, and crashing through the ice means constant 
noise and vibration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Forty West Germans -- each paying $20,500 -- will be the first Westerners to 
travel on a Soviet icebreaker to the North Pole, on a trip starting at the end 
of July from the northern port of Murmansk. 
</P>
<P>
The Rossiya icebreaker will take about two weeks for the 1,450-mile trip to the 
pole, made in the constant daylight of the Arctic summer. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be a regular thing," said Vassily Loban, director of foreign 
relations at the Murmansk Shipping Co., which runs the icebreakers. "We've had 
inquiries from other countries, such as the United States and Canada." 
</P>
<P>
The Rossiya, with twin nuclear reactors generating 75,000 horsepower, will take 
a group of West German businessmen and reporters to the pole in an experiment 
with the Soviet Union's policies of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
Snow-scooters and two helicopters on board will allow trips onto the icecap, 
Loban said. 
</P>
<P>
The Murmansk Shipping Co. is also planning to start the first regular shipping 
service on the Arctic sea route from Europe to Japan from July -- a route 
littered with wrecks of ships seeking the shortcut to the east. 
</P>
<P>
Trips on the so-called Northeast Passage will take about 25 days, 10 days 
shorter than the route through the Suez Canal. 
</P>
<P>
Loban said an 18,000-ton vessel of the Norilsk class, with a hardened hull, 
will travel the route once a month from July to October, carrying cargo for 
Western clients. 
</P>
<P>
The Murmansk Shipping Co. is also trying to arrange for nuclear icebreakers to 
lead convoys of Western ships through the Northeast Passage. But so far, the 
Kremlin has refused. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically we're ready, but we're awaiting a political decision by Moscow," 
said Loban. 
</P>
<P>
The route through the Arctic passes sensitive military installations. In the 
past, nuclear icebreakers could help blast routes for warships from the Pacific 
fleet in Vladivostok to the Northern fleet, based near Murmansk -- helping to 
keep them away from Western surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Loban, talking to a group of reporters visiting Murmansk recently from Norway, 
said the Soviet Union wanted to "show off our nuclear merchant vessels, to 
change the world's opinion. We have 30 years of experience and they are 
ecologically safe." 
</P>
<P>
Public protests in the Soviet Far East last year prevented some nuclear-powered 
Soviet vessels from docking. 
</P>
<P>
In the reactor control room of the Taymyr, which came into service in 1989, 
several technicians watched a wall of dials and gauges. 
</P>
<P>
One was glued to a television monitor linked to a camera scanning the reactor 
encased in the hull amidships a few yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 30 years of successful operation of the atomic icebreaker fleet," boasts 
a poster in English in Krylov's office on the Taymyr. 
</P>
<P>
Krylov dismissed Western reports that the Lenin, the oldest of the icebreakers 
-- and now being withdrawn from service -- had a nuclear accident in the 1970s. 
It was in dock for several years "to make modernizations and change the 
reactor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norway, which is a NATO member, and the Soviet Union recently opened the first 
air and boat links for tourists to visit Murmansk -- reflecting the easing of 
tensions between the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers by boat can now see and freely photograph the might of the Soviet 
navy, based along the Murmansk fiord. 
</P>
<P>
Icebreakers can cut through sheet ice about six feet thick at a rate of 2.5 
knots per hour. Ice at the pole in midsummer is usually around 16 feet thick, 
but fractures in the icecap allow the vessels to slice through. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet fleet has the world's only purpose-built nuclear icebreakers. They 
can travel the Northeast Passage from July to November, sometimes December. 
Heavily insulated, covered orange lifeboats hang from the sides. 
</P>
<P>
The Taymyr, 502 feet long and with a bow 1.7 inches thick, was built by 
Finland's Wartsila company, but had its single nuclear reactor fitted in 
Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
It has a crew of about 110 men and 15 women. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the crew has a separate cabin, and alcohol is restricted. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir, a radio operator, said it is possible to call home from the vessel 
even when it is in the Arctic, where temperatures can dip to minus 58 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
The corridors of the Taymyr, where the bridge is eight stories above the deck, 
are painted a soft yellow and have large posters of alpine or woodland scenes 
at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
Large plastic pot plants stand in recreation rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The crew works for four months followed by a four-month rest, Krylov said. 
Working on an icebreaker means earning several times the normal wage in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"But then there's little to buy when you get back home," Krylov joked.

ASSEMBLYMAN PEACE'S WATER IDEA A TURNOFF IN SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Water meters. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the sweltering, tree-lined neighborhoods of the state capital, 
them's fighting words. And right now, the citizens of Sacramento are in such a 
lather that they would like nothing better than to throttle Assemblyman Steve 
Peace (D-Rancho San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
Peace has incurred this community's wrath with his one-man crusade to force the 
installation of water meters on all Sacramento County homes by the end of the 
century, an expensive retrofit that would excavate lawns, cost more than $100 
million and increase water bills by 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Cradled by the American and Sacramento rivers, the capital has been so proud of 
its abundance of water that its city charter actually prohibits the meters at 
any residence. Unmetered water is about as sacred to the average Sacramentan as 
free parking at the beach is to a San Diegan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a birthright," said Roberta Larson, a Sacramento public works 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the four-year drought, Peace has argued that Sacramento's birthright 
is actually a symbol of water indifference. And, with his characteristic flair 
for controversy, the outspoken lawmaker has managed to push his water meter 
bill through one house of the Legislature, inflaming local tempers and setting 
the stage for a regional water war between the capital and laid-back San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On June 8, the day after Peace's water meter bill passed the Assembly 42 to 21, 
his picture was run on the front page of the Sacramento Bee alongside a 
cleverly edited, slightly inflammatory quote: "Some of us are water hogs. Some 
of us are not." 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, a Sacramento Union editorial, playing on the title of the 
cult film Peace made before entering politics, called his bill "Attack of the 
Killer Water Meters." 
</P>
<P>
His opponents have accused Peace of picking on Sacramento just to curry favor 
with his constituents, many of whom are Imperial Valley farmers with a 
reputation as some of the profligate water wasters in the state. They also 
point out that the water meter bill applies solely to Sacramento, conveniently 
leaving out smaller unmetered cities such as Brawley, which lies in Peace's 
district. They say Peace should concentrate his efforts closer to home -- like 
in San Diego, where the city has steadfastly refused to institute the kind of 
mandatory water controls that were instituted recently in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"It just makes the entire situation all the more obscene," Sacramento-area 
Assemblyman Tim Leslie said, adding that Peace's crusade is "absolutely 
hypocritical." 
</P>
<P>
"What should I do? Should I introduce a bill, now, to go down to San Diego and 
have mandatory water rationing?" said Leslie (R-Carmichael). "Maybe we should 
find an inefficient way to have them spend $100 million. It makes as much 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
Added Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Carson), "This is just a cheap politician's 
trick to say, 'Look at what I'm doing about the drought,' which is nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a guy from down in the desert, that pours hundreds of thousands of 
gallons on their damn, rich golf courses and, in the heat of the desert, it 
evaporates into the 
</P>
<P>
air," said Floyd, who is from the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Peace shrugs it all off. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of people (in Sacramento) oppose it," he acknowledged. "It's 
quite natural. The instinctive reaction is, 'We get something for free now; why 
should we support putting in a meter?' Probably the hardest thing is the 
perception that this is Southern California legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"But, just because you're from one part of the state or another part of the 
state doesn't make them good guys or bad guys," Peace said. "What it boils down 
to is water meters are the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
He also disputed the notion that he undertook the bill to impress his 
constituents more than 500 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows in San Diego that Sacramento is not on water meters, and nobody 
cares," Peace said. "There are no political pluses in it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the premise of his controversial bill is simple: People are more likely 
to conserve water when they can keep track -- and must pay -- according to 
their consumption of the precious resource. 
</P>
<P>
As proof, he cites statistics that show the average unmetered Sacramentan used 
an average of 291 gallons of water a day in 1980, contrasted with 197 gallons a 
day used by the average citizen in Stockton, a metered community with a similar 
climate, 50 miles south of the capital. Retrofitting Sacramento with meters 
would save 63,000 acre-feet of water a year, he claims. (An acre-foot is 
326,000 gallons.) 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't have any way of having any perception of what they're 
using," Peace said about unmetered communities. "And ignoring the statewide 
interest we all have in making the best and most conscientious use of water, if 
I conserve my water and use it judiciously, shouldn't I pay less than my 
neighbor who hoses down his driveway three times a day and keeps his toilet 
running?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet Sacramento water officials say Peace's arguments are flat-out wrong. Their 
main salvo is a 1985 study by the Denver Board of Water Commissioners that 
showed the presence of water meters had no predictable effect on water 
conservation in selected neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (legislators) may have a misimpression that having water meters 
itself is enough to conserve water," Sacramento Mayor Anne Rudin said. "People 
will just run as much as they want, and then pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Besides that, say Rudin and others, Sacramento's water woes are decidedly 
different from those in San Diego. Unlike arid Southern California, Sacramento 
has too much water at times. The current worry around the capital is whether 
the levees will hold back the rivers when the drought finally breaks. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sacramentans argue that they really don't consume their water, but 
merely borrow it. Indoor use is no greater than in other places, and the vast 
majority of the water is sent back, treated, into the rivers for reuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't really used," said Baxter Culver, lobbyist for Sacramento County. "It 
goes back to a beneficial use downstream, whether it goes down the delta or Los 
Angeles. It hasn't gone away." 
</P>
<P>
As far as the water lavished on the capital's landscaping, San Diego must 
understand that trees, bushes and lush lawns are part of what makes Sacramento 
bearable during the muggy San Joaquin Valley summers, when temperatures 
consistently top 100 degrees, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego in July, particularly out toward the coast, is a very pleasant 
place," said Culver. "While we might be using a little more water, (San 
Diegans) aren't using as much energy for air conditioning. They're getting a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
"So why do they resent us having a better water supply, a less expensive water 
supply, and insist upon these meters?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the simmering indignation over Peace is the fact that water-rich 
Sacramento has shown up San Diego with its past and current efforts to curtail 
the use of water. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, for instance, unmetered Sacramento -- where the average homeowner 
pays $9.21 a month for his water service -- managed to cut its consumption by 
13% in a voluntary conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, metered San Diego -- where water now costs the average household 
$16.80 a month -- and its suburbs could muster only a 4% savings during a 
voluntary program in 1988. In 1989, the San Diego area didn't even have a 
voluntary conservation program, said a spokesman with the San Diego County 
Water Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the drought stretches painfully into its fourth year, metered San Diego 
has drawn criticism from surrounding cities and Peace himself for declining to 
join the growing list of municipalities that have enacted mandatory controls. 
Instead, it has opted for a voluntary public relations strategy that, in its 
first two weeks, has shown an estimated water reduction of 15%, said the water 
authority spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, officials have taken a harder line with a mandatory program 
aimed at saving 20%. The program, which went into effect June 1, requires 
residents to water lawns no more than three times a week and prohibits hosing 
down outside pavement except for health reasons. A squad of six "water cops" 
have been hired to cite scofflaws, who could see their monthly bill jump 
fivefold after their third infraction. 
</P>
<P>
Peace himself agrees that San Diego's softer approach to conservation is 
"stark-raving bizarre," and says revenge-minded colleagues have already warned 
that they will amend the measure to shove mandatory rationing down the city's 
throat. He has hastened to add that the city of San Diego is not within his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
But Peace has no way of avoiding what has been the favorite target of 
Sacramentans angered by the meter bill: the Imperial Valley farmers and their 
irrigation district. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the state Department of Water Resources investigation concluded that 
the Imperial Irrigation District was guilty of wasting huge amounts of water 
through mismanagement, unlined earthen canals and the failure to reclaim water 
left over from the extensive farming operations. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the state ordered the district to adopt conservation 
programs to save 438,000 acre-feet a year. Since an acre-foot is enough to 
supply the needs of two typical California households a year, the Imperial 
Valley savings would be the equivalent of the water used by 875,000 homes -- 
more than twice the size of the city of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The rural district resisted state orders, however, and the issue has gone to 
court twice. In April, 1988, a San Diego Superior Court judge 
</P>
<P>
ruled that the IID's "failure to implement additional water-conservation 
measures is unreasonable" and a violation of the state constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The impasse was broken last December when the the Metropolitan Water District, 
which services San Diego and five other Southern California counties, announced 
it would spend $220 million for conservation projects in the rural irrigation 
district. In exchange, the Imperial water agency has agreed to export to the 
MWD about 106,000 acre-feet of the water conserved -- a figure that is still 
only about 25% of the potential savings. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento Union's June 11 editorial pulled no punches about the Imperial 
Valley farmers and Peace. 
</P>
<P>
"While Assemblyman Peace piously claims his bill is needed to increase water 
conservation, the fact is that this Sacramento-bashing bill will play well in 
his Southern California district and in nearby districts," it said. "Never mind 
that farmers in Imperial County, which constitutes the major portion of Peace's 
80th District, have been some of the biggest water wasters in California 
because of a refusal to line irrigation canals with cement. (They are finally 
being forced to do so by various agencies.) 
</P>
<P>
"By sticking something to Sacramento County, Peace probably hopes to deflect 
some of the criticism from his constituents who have been pressured by the 
state to do more to conserve water," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Peace said the current board members of the irrigation district are committed 
to improve water conservation and sell off what they save. He called the 
controversy and lawsuits "ancient history." 
</P>
<P>
As far as Sacramento goes, Peace acknowledged that he wrote the bill in such a 
way that it would apply only to the capital area, although there are unmetered 
communities in his district and throughout the San Joaquin Valley. To do 
otherwise would garner overwhelming opposition and ensure defeat of the bill, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even his legislative colleagues from the capital, who are publicly opposed to 
the meter bill, are privately supportive, Peace said. The bill now moves to a 
Senate committee, where critics predict it will be killed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peace said he finds the public outcry over the cost of the meters in 
the capital a bit ironic, given the fact that Sacramentans were willing to pay 
handsomely in the city's recent, unsuccessful bid to lure the Los Angeles 
Raiders football team to town. 
</P>
<P>
"In Sacramento, they chose to offer $60 million to bring a football team to 
town," he said, "but they don't want to spend any money to conserve water."

WIND KEEPS BRUSH FIRE AWAY FROM FILLMORE; 
</P>
<P>
POLE CANYON: ARSON IS SUSPECTED IN A BLAZE THAT BURNED MORE THAN 255 ACRES AND 
COULD HAVE THREATENED THE CITY'S 11,000 RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A raging brush fire that swept through Pole Canyon, narrowly missing the city 
of Fillmore, had burned more than 255 acres of dry shrubs late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly winds of 10 m.p.h. pushed the flames away from the city, sparing 
Fillmore's 11,000 residents from what could have been a major catastrophe. The 
fire, which burned to within a couple miles east of the city, raced over the 
city's best-known landmark, an "F" overlooking California 126, but the chalk 
letter was not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate that we have a sea breeze today and not Santa Ana winds," 
said Sandy Wells, a spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department. "If it 
were blowing in the opposite direction, the fire would be headed directly into 
the city" from where it began two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said that even if the fire continues to burn today, it is not likely to 
reach Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the cloud of smoke coming out of the canyon could be seen as far east 
as Moorpark and as far west as Oxnard. The fire had caused no injuries or 
structural damage late Saturday. A spokesman for the Southern California Edison 
Co. said power and transmission lines were not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
About 130 firefighters, 25 engines, four helicopters, three tankers and two 
airplanes from the county Fire Department and the state Department of Forestry 
and Fire Protection responded to the emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were 51 minimum-security inmates from the Fenner Canyon facility of 
the California Youth Authority. The inmates have been trained by state forestry 
personnel as reserve firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
As the planes and helicopters dropped water from the air, fire crews climbed 
the rugged hills armed with hose packs, axes, chain saws and shovels to clear a 
semicircle on the east end of the canyon, where they prepared to fend off the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
"As the fire turns on top of the ridge and heads downhill in the shade and 
without wind -- that's when we hope to get lucky," said George Lund, Ventura 
County deputy fire chief. "We're hoping to contain it sometime tonight." 
</P>
<P>
But by nightfall, the fire remained uncontrolled. "I think we're gonna be out 
all night and through the heat of tomorrow," Lund said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire had not been determined Saturday, but arson investigator 
Peter Crunk said it was not started by natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely arson," he said. "Whether it was intentional or negligent I 
don't know yet, but whoever did it should have not been there with the elements 
to start a fire." 
</P>
<P>
Crunk said he believes that the fire was started by two young backpackers who 
were seen by witnesses running from the scene. Witnesses could not provide a 
description of the suspects, Crunk said. 
</P>
<P>
Police blocked off 4th Street and a dirt road leading to Pole Canyon, but 
residents were not evacuated. Barbara Harm, whose home was the closest to the 
fire, prepared for the worst by hosing her rooftop and clearing brush around 
her property, with help from half a dozen relatives who came to her aid. 
</P>
<P>
"If it comes, we're ready for it," Harm said. Her daughter, Jodie Lloyd, 20, 
had joined the state forestry department a month ago and on Saturday was part 
of the fire suppression team. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it something that in her first fire she gets to go out to protect her 
own home," Harm said. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents seemed less worried. Saturday's was the fourth fire near Pole 
Canyon in the past five years, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it keeps blowing up canyon, we don't have to worry about it," said 
Carl Stephens III, who was sitting in his swimming pool watching his four young 
sons and nephews swim. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County firefighters had a busy afternoon. In addition to the Fillmore 
fire, firefighters put out a one-acre fire in Santa Paula near the 12th Street 
bridge, and 15 firefighters responded to a fire north of Ventura near Ventura 
Avenue and Canada Larga Road that burned two acres of brush. There were no 
injuries or structural damages reported in either incident. 
</P>
<P>
The Fillmore fire was the second big fire of the year reported in the county. 
In April, an unattended campfire burned more than 600 acres in Los Padres 
National Forest.

CAUTION AT THE BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two government actions announced last week offer the hope of reducing crime 
against the thousands of illegal immigrants who traverse dangerous border 
terrain on their daily trek into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol's decision to install floodlights in the rugged "Gravel Pit" 
area west of the San Ysidro port of entry, where seven migrants have been 
killed this year, is perhaps new Chief Agent Gustavo de la Vina's best option 
to deter violence. 
</P>
<P>
Also welcome is the increased San Diego police presence in the treacherous 
canyons. Members of an elite police unit will begin patrolling the border zone 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
One note of caution. History demonstrates that gunplay between police and 
suspected thieves at the border is inevitable. From 1984 to 1989, members of 
the police Border Crime Prevention Unit shot 44 people, killing 18. 
</P>
<P>
With scores of innocent people likely to be near the scene of any shooting, we 
hope that the Special Response Team will not carry its standard submachine guns 
into the canyons, opting to patrol the border more lightly armed. That strategy 
also could allay perennial Mexican fears of a heavy arms buildup on the 
frontier between our nations.

TURNING DOWN TAP

The photo of the fountain outside the San Diego County Administration Center, 
published in The Times June 19, apparently was taken before the Board of 
Supervisors directed that ornamental fountains at all county government 
buildings be shut down. As California enters its fourth year of drought, the 
county is turning down the tap on water use at all of its facilities.

Instead of expanding the checkpoints at San Onofre, which will only further

Any illegal immigrants or drugs that slip past that checkpoint deserve to be

REFLECTIONS: 'I WANT TO LET AS MANY CHILDREN AS I CAN MEET KNOW THAT LEARNING 
IS EXCITING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. Jeanette Avent, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

Mission Hills resident Judi Willkins, also known as the Fairy Godmother and 
Captain Morgana, Queen of the Reformed Pirates to hundreds of school children, 
bought the S&amp;S International Bookshop in April to give a home to her 
musical shows for children. Willkins presents as many as five shows a week at 
the shop, giving children and adults a chance to mend the gap between 
themselves and their heritage. She was interviewed by Times Staff Writer G. 
Jeanette Avent and photographed by Bruce K. Huff. 
</P>
<P>
I have two children, two foster children and seven grandchildren, so I've been 
very involved in teaching children. When I was into ceramics, I would teach 
children ceramics in my home; when I was into weaving, I would teach them 
weaving. Anything I felt they wanted to learn, I would make the time to teach 
them, because I didn't want them to lose the spark. I want to let as many 
children as I can meet know that learning is exciting. 
</P>
<P>
I've also been involved with music for many years. The first instrument I 
played was an E Flat Alto saxophone with the Salvation Army Band. I was about 
7. I thought it was so neat that they stood out on corners and played music to 
people, I asked if I could join. They gave me a horn and lessons, and I played 
with the band until I was about in the sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
About three years ago, I started a group, the Black Thorns Maritime Band, to 
work with young audiences. We do shows in school, shopping malls and private 
parties to teach children maritime history through stories and songs. I work 
with a classically trained guitarist, bassist and flute players to give the 
children a very fine musical experience, too. 
</P>
<P>
We try to present it in a pretty exciting way, and we involve them from the 
beginning. When I am Captain Morgana, Queen of the Reformed Pirates, I dress in 
a huge, Renaissance-style dress with all kinds of jewels and a big cap with 
feathers in it. 
</P>
<P>
I'm trying to present what I think is a wonderful tradition and one that is 
beneficial to children. Storytelling demands that children create their own 
images. I tell them we are going to take them on an imaginary trip back in time 
when pirates and thieves roved these great seas of ours. There's a real 
theatrical work to bring them into the story. We pretend we are taking the Star 
of India, and we're going to need a crew. Hands go up all over the audience. 
</P>
<P>
In the maritime show, we talk about the different areas the sailors and pirates 
came from. When we're rounding the coast of New England we talk about sailors 
from Wales, England and Ireland. When we travel into the Caribbean, South 
America and to China by way of Hawaii, we have different kinds of songs and 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
The songs tell us a little bit about the world. They tell us what people were 
thinking. They tell us what life was like. There are very few good, written 
pictures of life on the big whaling ships. Those men didn't keep big diaries. 
But in those songs, you can hear how rough their lives were. One of our tips to 
the children is how to be observant and listen to what a song says because 
they'll learn something from it. At the end of the show, I encourage them to be 
a part of that creating spirit that tells the world a little about their view. 
If I can get one child excited about writing stories, I'll tell stories till 
the cows come home. 
</P>
<P>
When I do the fairy godmother I talk about European history, Celtic history and 
tradition. Storytelling is about tradition. It's about an oral tradition that 
preserves history and explains the world in the best way people could before 
there were books and before there were as many explanations for the world as 
there are today. It's about magic and about dreams coming true. 
</P>
<P>
I've been doing the children's shows full time for eight years. Senior citizens 
love them too. With the seniors, I encourage them to leave as a legacy not 
their money or their jewels or their china, but to leave the story of their 
lives. There is no more important legacy to leave your children than the story 
of when you were a child because that can never happen again. This comes out of 
a real concern for what has happened to our family structure. The family 
structure of the '40s and '50s has changed dramatically because of the economic 
demands that have been placed on the family. As we are evolving toward a new 
structure, what is happening is that the elders in the community who typically 
were the ones who had a lot of time to spend with the children, the ones who 
passed on the lessons of morals and ethics, are living in communities of their 
own, living away from their family. Those lessons aren't being passed on to 
children, and the parents are too busy to do it. 
</P>
<P>
I'm working with and promoting an intergenerational type of experience between 
children and the elders of our community. At the very least, when one of their 
grandchildren has a birthday, I encourage grandparents to write a story of the 
birthday that was the most important in their life. When the next new baby 
comes along in the family, write the story of when their daughter was born and 
what it felt like to hold her in their arms. Children need to feel this tie 
with their heritage, this tie with their family, this tie with their ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
I've been getting some very fine feedback on that. Some people have actually 
written little books, and given them as gifts during Christmas to all the 
grandchildren, about their favorite Christmas. I think a lot of effort ought to 
be made to bring children and grandparents together.

DIOXIN IN NORTHWEST'S COLUMBIA RIVER THREATENS FISH, HUMAN HEALTH; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: PAPER MILLS ARE DUMPING THE TOXIC COMPOUND INTO THE ONCE-PRISTINE 
RIVER. OREGON IS CONSIDERING LIMITS ON THE DUMPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. CRUM, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Columbia River drains a Texas-sized corner of northwestern North America, 
its historically pristine waters rushing to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly spared the industrial pollution threatening other great rivers, the 
Columbia is the heart of a vast and fertile land. 
</P>
<P>
Majestic bald eagles nest along its lower reaches. Salmon fight their way 
upstream in an annual ritual of renewal. 
</P>
<P>
But all may not be well on the river. Environmentalists, armed with federal 
studies, say a nearly imperceptible adversary threatens to drain the life out 
of the Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 studies by the Environmental Protection Agency show six pulp and paper 
mills on the Columbia in Oregon and Washington dump dioxins and related toxic 
compounds into the river, where they are accumulating in fish in unprecedented 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
An EPA official concluded the pollution poses a significant threat to human 
health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA sampled bottom fish in the Columbia. Unlike migratory salmon, bottom 
feeders, such as carp and sturgeon, spend their lives in the river. 
</P>
<P>
Dioxins, the chemical that caused the evacuation of Love Canal, cause cancer in 
laboratory animals, and some scientists are questioning studies that so far 
have found no cancer link in humans. The compounds also persist in soil for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Dioxins and other chlorinated organic compounds are byproducts of bleaching 
wood pulp to make white paper. While many industrial processes produce dioxins, 
environmentalists say the pulp mills are the greatest offenders on the river. 
</P>
<P>
Based on EPA guidelines, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the 
Washington Department of Ecology are considering limits on discharges of the 
most toxic of the dioxins, 2,3,7,8-TCDD of 0.013 parts per quadrillion in water 
just downstream from the mills. A concentration that low cannot be measured 
using current technology, so the states would use a mathematical formula to 
calculate whether the mills are in compliance. 
</P>
<P>
The limits on dioxin discharges are written into permits for the mills, but 
final action is being delayed by appeals in Oregon, where new permits have been 
issued. Washington's Department of Ecology is in the final stages of preparing 
new permits. 
</P>
<P>
The regional pulp and paper industry says meeting the new standards would be 
too expensive, $815 million over three years for all the mills in the region. 
And it says its own study shows dioxin levels that are undetectable or well 
within U.S. Food and Drug Administration limits. Its conclusion: River fish are 
safe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
All this is enough to rile people like Mary O'Brien, staff scientist of the 
Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most toxic compound known to humans," she said. "And if we can't 
tell the industry 'no' to dumping the most toxic compound known to humans into 
the river for some superfluous purpose like whiteness of paper, what are we 
willing to regulate in the world?" 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's group, along with Columbia River United, want dioxin discharges 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop talking to me about how much dioxin is acceptable," O'Brien said, "and 
start talking to me about how to get rid of it all." 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, one of Oregon's top public health officials, Dr. Laurence Foster, has 
agreed there is no reason to advise most people to eat less fish. 
</P>
<P>
But privately, in a March 16 letter to Llewellyn Matthews, executive director 
of the Northwest Pulp and Paper Assn., Foster tore into the industry's study. 
</P>
<P>
After several months of review, he said, the Oregon Health Division found the 
study did not support the conclusion that Columbia River fish are safe. 
</P>
<P>
"It would seem the good citizen's responsibility to do everything possible to 
prevent future generations from being exposed to ever-increasing body burdens 
of this toxic chemical," said Foster, acting health officer and deputy 
administrator of the Oregon Health Division. 
</P>
<P>
"I encourage you, for the sake of future Oregonians, to do everything possible 
to stop all discharge of dioxin into the environment." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Foster said he had no comment beyond the letter, made public 
by John Bonine of the Western Natural Resources Law Clinic at the University of 
Oregon. Foster added he did not mean to question the good intentions of the 
industry, only the science upon which the conclusion that the fish are safe to 
eat was based. 
</P>
<P>
The state eventually plans its own study of the fish. 
</P>
<P>
Industry spokesmen say they are reducing dioxin discharges. But they argue it 
is unfair to set standards at undetectable levels. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to undertake every reasonable effort to reduce," Matthews said. 
"We're shooting for 80%." 
</P>
<P>
She said environmentalists blow the danger out of proportion. "Dioxin is 
overrated as a carcinogen," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatives exist to the chlorine bleaching process that produces dioxins. One 
mill, the James River mill in Camas, has produced dioxin-free paper as an 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
However, industry officials say consumers want the bright white paper produced 
by chlorine bleaching. They are reluctant to make the expensive transition to 
alternatives as long as there are doubts about whether consumers will buy the 
new products. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not good enough for O'Brien. "These animals just die out silently,"

EL SEGUNDO, UPS BATTLE OVER PROPOSED FACILITY; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: CITY RETRACTS APPROVAL OF NEW SITE AFTER STUDY PREDICTS GREATER- 
THAN-EXPECTED CONGESTION. 
</P>

In a dispute clouded by possible litigation, El Segundo and United Parcel 
Service are at odds over how much new traffic a proposed UPS facility will 
bring to an already-congested industrial and office park east of Sepulveda 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
After Chevron USA Inc. subdivided undeveloped property in the park three years 
ago, UPS bought 23.7 acres for a $35-million facility to serve its growing 
South Bay and Westside business. The purchase for an undisclosed price was made 
after the El Segundo Planning Commission concluded that the already-busy area 
could handle 2,604 daily vehicle trips in or out of the UPS center. 
</P>
<P>
But after a later environmental impact report on the facility postulated daily 
traffic at the 5,310-trip level, the commission balked. Last January, it denied 
the UPS project, despite a UPS offer to institute such traffic reduction 
measures as employee ride-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic volume was unacceptable," said Kendra Morries, city planning 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
In a sometimes-testy appeals hearing before the City Council last month, UPS 
offered a legal guarantee to keep its traffic below the 2,604 daily trip level 
or pay fines for the excess. Arguing that the project meets all laws and 
conditions controlling the Chevron subdivision, UPS attorney Maura O'Connor 
said city approval is required. If it is not, she said, UPS "has to pursue 
legal remedies." 
</P>
<P>
Although the matter remains unsettled pending completion of new traffic studies 
by both sides, Councilman Scot Dannen said negotiation is difficult under what 
he termed a "give-it-to-us-or-else" legal threat. 
</P>
<P>
Dannen termed the UPS legal posture "a cheap act of terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Passolt, UPS regional real estate manager, characterized the flap with the 
city as a "misunderstanding and miscommunication" that the company is working 
to reconcile without litigation. 
</P>
<P>
However, City Atty. Leland Dolley said he has received a preliminary document 
from UPS attorneys challenging the city's ability to reject the project. UPS 
officials refused to comment on the document. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic dispute focuses not only on the widely varying average daily 
traffic projections, but also on the impact of the UPS center on streets and 
major intersections during peak morning and evening driving time. 
</P>
<P>
UPS presented its traffic guarantee based on a 24-hour period, but the council 
has labeled this meaningless without knowing when the greatest amount of 
traffic will occur and what that volume will be. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Alan West said he can visualize hundreds of brown UPS vans on the 
road. "If it happens at 2 a.m., OK, but if it all happens at 7 a.m., we're in 
trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman J. B. Wise said he is concerned about not only peak-hour traffic, 
but also about the size of the UPS vehicles. In addition to its familiar large 
brown vans, the company uses tractor-trailers for major customers. 
</P>
<P>
The city traffic engineer and UPS are surveying selected UPS facilities 
comparable to the proposed El Segundo center to determine when -- and to what 
extent -- most traffic occurs. Another council session on the UPS issue is 
scheduled for July 17, when the study results are expected. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city and UPS, the proposed El Segundo facility -- which would 
be next to the long-established golf driving range on Sepulveda -- will have 
749 employees, along with 300 vans and 20 tractor-trailers for delivery of 
parcels and documents. 
</P>
<P>
David Shockley, UPS real estate representative, said vans and trucks will leave 
in staggered fashion between 8:30 and 9:15 a.m., returning between 5:30 and 7 
p.m. He said average daily traffic -- including vans and trucks, employees and 
customers -- is not expected to exceed 2,529 trips. Most would occur between 6 
a.m. and 7 p.m. (A trip is defined as a movement in or out of the facility; the 
movement of a tractor-trailer counts for two trips.) 
</P>
<P>
To lessen the traffic impact, he said, UPS vehicles will avoid congested 
intersections and will operate a satellite customer facility during the holiday 
package rush. 
</P>
<P>
UPS officials have criticized the environmental impact report that projected 
the center would generate 5,310 daily traffic trips as greatly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
The projection was based on operations at the company's Anaheim office, which 
was included in a list of facilities comparable to the proposed El Segundo 
center that UPS gave to the city. But Passolt, the UPS regional real estate 
manager, said that in doing the report, the city failed to take into account 
that Anaheim is a district facility with a larger customer counter and more 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Ron Cano said UPS did not challenge the environmental report when 
city officials certified it. But Shockley said UPS sent a letter protesting the 
count, which was attached to the report. 
</P>
<P>
UPS said that with its business growth, the El Segundo center is needed to 
reduce trip lengths and augment overcrowded Gardena and West Los Angeles 
facilities that serve the area.

RITES OF PASSAGE; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM GIVES AT-RISK TEEN-AGE GIRLS A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Last fall, Crystal Evans, 13, faced expulsion after she and some friends were 
caught drinking alcohol on the campus of Stephen M. White Junior High School in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Then her counselor referred her to Rites of Passage, a 12-week-long pilot 
program aimed at building the self-esteem of troubled teen-age girls and 
showing them that there is an alternative to drugs, gangs and teen-age 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the same girl aspires to be a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"Before (the class), I thought I didn't care if I got in trouble; I just wanted 
to fit in the crowd," said Crystal, who has twice refused offers to join gangs. 
"But now I see I do care." 
</P>
<P>
It was a hard-earned victory for Janice Garcia, the 30-year-old former gang 
member who ran the program. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them don't realize they are at risk" from drugs and gangs, even 
though many of them live in gang-infested neighborhoods and their parents 
openly abuse drugs or alcohol in their own homes, Garcia said Tuesday after the 
program's last class. "To them, it's just a part of growing up." 
</P>
<P>
The 19 girls who participated in Rites of Passage were referred to Garcia by 
counselors. About half of them are gang members. Most have used drugs and 
alcohol and are considered at risk of dropping out of school. Several are 
sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the girls resisted the message, but most of them gradually softened, 
Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
During weekly classes of about 45 minutes each, the girls undertook several 
activities designed to make them more aware of their cultural, social and 
personal histories and build their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
They made family trees, saw a video about gangs, listened to a lecture about 
AIDS, and had makeup and etiquette classes. They kept notebooks, learned 
strategies to cope with anger and organized a car wash to raise money for a 
graduation dinner at the Grand House in San Pedro on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a smart red dress and well-coiffed hairstyle, Garcia seems at first 
glance worlds away from her young charges. Her account of her own involvement 
with drugs and gangs, however, rang true to the students. 
</P>
<P>
Acting more as a mentor and friend than as a teacher, Garcia told them how 
painful it was to remove the tattoos she drunkenly agreed to get as a 
teen-ager. When the girls needed someone to talk to about everything from 
menstrual cramps to fears of being pregnant, she served as a trusted 
confidante. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, she helped persuade a student who had run away from home to 
return to her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"She's what really made me want to come home," said Elsa Aguilar, 14. "She told 
me that being out on the street was not the right way, that a lot of runaways 
get killed, take drugs or get pregnant. I thought it would be easy out there. 
Now I know she was right." 
</P>
<P>
Rites of Passage was developed five years ago at the Youth and Family Center at 
Leuzinger High School in Lawndale to help teen-age fathers make the transition 
to manhood. The center has since moved to Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The program was designed by Ron Johnson, a former New York gang member and 
consultant on at-risk youth for the California Department of Education, who is 
writing a book about manhood for teen-age boys. 
</P>
<P>
The premise of Rites of Passage is that many youngsters think adulthood is 
defined by gang involvement, drug use and even prison time, Johnson said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
In his years of working with troubled youngsters, Johnson identified several 
areas of growth or "rites of passage" that would offer troubled teen-agers a 
different understanding of the transition to adulthood, one that would involve 
personal, cultural, social, physical, economic and emotional growth. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other teen-age intervention programs that are organized around a single 
problem such as drug use or gangs or pregnancy, "Rites of Passage teaches kids 
to look at their entire lives," Johnson said. The program is also designed to 
be relevant for all youngsters, regardless of race or ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 young men have completed a yearlong version of the program, and the 
state Department of Education is planning to test the 12-week version of the 
course in a pilot project at six schools, Johnson said. Before this year, 
however, the program had never been adapted to the needs of teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
When the program captured the interest of the federally funded Community 
Reclamation Project, a program that works to strengthen the network of South 
Bay community groups fighting against drugs and gangs, Johnson agreed to create 
a version for girls and to train Garcia to be the coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Although school administrators supported the project, there were obstacles: The 
group had to search for an empty classroom every time it met and usually ran 
out of time before the day's activities were complete. 
</P>
<P>
During their last meeting, however, the obstacles seemed like mere 
inconveniences. When the girls anonymously evaluated the program, not one 
comment was negative. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to feel better about myself, how to get closer to Mom, Dad," one 
girl wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Another defined the ideas that had benefited her the most: "Drugs isn't your 
life. Gangs wasn't or isn't fun." 
</P>
<P>
As the girls snacked on doughnuts and fruit juice, Garcia became teary-eyed as 
she struggled to find the words she hoped would make a lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the nicest thing I could have possibly done, to make an impact on you 
guys," Garcia said. "Maybe down the line you'll remember something I said: That 
even if you do have problems you can come out of them. It's hard, but you can 
do whatever you want."

MANY SEPTIC USERS PAYING SEWER FEES; 
</P>
<P>
CLAIMS: A LEGAL GROUP IS ACTING ON BEHALF OF 8 PACOIMA RESIDENTS WHO 
UNWITTINGLY MAY HAVE PAID HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR A SERVICE THEY DO NOT 
RECEIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of mostly low-income Los Angeles residents 
whose homes are connected to septic tanks have been paying hundreds of dollars 
annually in sewer fees for as long as 12 years because they are unaware that 
they must first ask the city to stop billing them. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, many of them immigrants who speak little or no English, 
apparently have not noticed or do not understand annual English-only water bill 
inserts explaining how to get exempted from sewer fees, city officials 
acknowledge. Otherwise, the fees -- averaging $10.43 per month for a 
single-family dwelling -- are billed to water customers automatically. 
</P>
<P>
Even if an exemption is granted, the city will refund charges only for the year 
preceding the date it was requested, officials said. Thus, a septic tank user 
who has been unwittingly paying the fees since Los Angeles began assessing them 
to residential customers in 1978 could have forfeited hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the city is robbing me -- just like in Mexico," said Pedro 
Velasquez, a Pacoima gardener who estimates he has paid about $600 in sewer 
fees since buying his home in 1985. He learned in January that he was entitled 
to an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, lawyers with San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services Inc. 
filed a claim with the city on behalf of Velasquez and seven other Pacoima 
residents seeking reimbursement for unwarranted sewer fees. The claimant who 
has paid the fees the longest, Robert Alvarez, bought his home on Brownell 
Street in 1981 and has never been hooked up to the sewer. 
</P>
<P>
The problem arises because the city charges the sewer fees to water customers 
based on the amount of water consumed, on the theory that a portion of the 
water ends up in the sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials said they do not know which water customers also are 
connected to the sewer system because parcel maps showing sewer connections are 
often outdated or inaccurate, said Fred Hoeptner, a senior civil engineer with 
the Los Angeles Department of Public Works waste water management division. 
</P>
<P>
The city would have to send inspectors to each of the 733,380 parcels in Los 
Angeles to determine which ones are on the sewer system, he said. Until such a 
count is made, the city will continue to bill septic tank users for sewer 
service unless they seek an exemption, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be done if the personnel resources were available," Hoeptner said. 
"It's probably unfeasible to catch every single one, but you could get a large 
number of them." 
</P>
<P>
Department of Public Works officials estimate that there are 590,000 sewer 
hookups, and estimate that 3% of the city's residents live in dwellings served 
by septic tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Nakamura, the attorney who filed the claim with the city, said he was told 
by city officials that 10,000 San Fernando Valley residents have requested 
exemptions since 1978. He said 40 to 50 new requests for exemptions are 
submitted to the city each month -- from the Valley alone, which has the 
largest concentration of septic tanks in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Many low-income renters who pay their own water bills might not know whether 
the property has a septic tank or sewer service and are continuing to pay the 
fees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city shouldn't rely on people claiming exemptions," Nakamura said. "They 
shouldn't bill in the first place. If any private business were doing this, the 
city attorney's office would probably prosecute them." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they figured it would be easier to bill everybody," Nakamura said. 
"The city actually makes money this way." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Nakamura nor city officials could estimate how much sewer fee money the 
city has collected from septic tank users. They also said they could not 
estimate how many would qualify for the exemptions but have not asked for them. 
</P>
<P>
The claim submitted on behalf of the eight Pacoima residents, who live along a 
stretch of Brownell Street that has no sewer access, says the current billing 
system violates California unfair business practice laws and other state laws. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the northeast 
Valley, said he agrees that the billing system should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was wrong from the start," Bernardi said. "I didn't think people 
that were connected to septic tanks should be charged that fee. I think 
administratively it's easier, but whether it's fair or not is another 
question." 
</P>
<P>
The residents intend to sue the city if the claim is denied, a result that 
Nakamura said is likely. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura said the lawsuit would contend that the city intentionally misled 
customers and that the plaintiffs were falsely led to believe the fee was 
appropriate because public agencies are expected to obey the law. 
</P>
<P>
The claim filed Friday grew out of an unsuccessful effort by Brownell Street 
resident Esteban Gallardo, 46, to obtain a sewer fee exemption. According to 
Gallardo, the Department of Water and Power threatened to cut off water to his 
house, which he has rented since 1986, if he refused to pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Gallardo mentioned the problem to neighbor Graciela Lopez, who 
advised him to contact the legal aid organization. 
</P>
<P>
After Nakamura and other legal aid attorneys heard Gallardo's story, they 
knocked on doors in the man's neighborhood to see if others had the same 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gallardo, who is unemployed and on welfare, many of the claimants are poor 
and speak little or no English. Many of them rent the small, ranch-style houses 
whose loosely tended front yards are marked by square, wood septic tank lids. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he believes many residents in his district still use septic tanks 
because of favorable soil conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure if there are eight people that filed, there are many, many more in 
that area" who use septic tanks and who are paying the sewer fees, he said. 
"The cesspools work in the sandy soil there." Nakamura said the city has not 
tried hard enough to solve the problem. He said city officials are taking 
advantage of poor people and Spanish-speaking residents who might not read or 
understand the fine points of their bimonthly water bill. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. John Haggerty, who represents the Department of 
Public Works, denied that the city has violated any laws. He agreed with 
Hoeptner that identifying all septic tank users is impractical, and said the 
city code clearly states that residents may only seek a year's worth of damages 
when making claims. 
</P>
<P>
But for the residents of Brownell Avenue who are seeking refunds, there was 
nothing proper about the way their money ended up in city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know until January" that the sewer fees were not required, said 
Margarita Velasquez, 17, Pedro Velasquez's daughter. "We were very upset. They 
were charging us for something we didn't have."

A Ventura High School sophomore will be among six students representing the 
state at the International Leadership Seminar, a conference that attracts 
students from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Osborne, 16, was selected from among 225 students who competed at 
Pepperdine University in a leadership seminar sponsored by the nonprofit 
foundation earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Sean, who will represent central California, will be among more than 200 
students from 30 countries, including the Soviet Union and China, at the 
all-expense-paid conference in St. Paul, Minn. in July. 
</P>
<P>
Students were nominated to participate on the basis of recommendations from 
their high school principals, said program director Bob Shirilla. Finalists 
were selected based on their performance in essay writing and interviews before 
a panel of judges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is sponsored by the Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation, a 
national, nonprofit organization founded in 1958 that aims to promote 
leadership skills and critical thinking among high school sophomores. ADRIANNE

WORKER SAYS ASBESTOS QUERY COST HIM HIS LAWNDALE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Lawndale employee, who says he and other youths were unknowingly 
exposed to asbestos while cleaning up rubble left from three city-owned 
buildings last summer, has told the City Council he was wrongly fired for 
trying to get information about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Maradiaga, 19, made his comments Thursday, moments after the Council agreed 
in a 3-1 vote to pay the legal bills of City Manager James Arnold and Public 
Works Director James Sanders, who have been criminally charged for their roles 
in the demolition last June. 
</P>
<P>
Both men pleaded not guilty Thursday to 17 misdemeanor counts of illegally 
disposing hazardous waste and failing to comply with state and federal 
regulations regarding the handling of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to go to court, I will, because I had my rights violated," Maradiaga 
told the council. "I think that was wrong that I got fired, and I want my job 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Maradiaga said in an interview that he was employed in a summer youth program 
last June when he and several other youths were asked to help clean up the 
demolition site. The youths were never told that they could be exposed to 
asbestos and were not ordered to wear any special clothing, as required by 
federal health and safety regulations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, about five months after he was hired by the city's Public Works 
Department as a part-time employee, Maradiaga learned from co-workers that he 
and the other youth workers may have been exposed to asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Worried about possible health effects, Maradiaga said, he made copies of a 
city-commissioned lab report that was hanging on a rack next to Sanders' 
office. The report said the city was not negligent in the way it disposed of 
the asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
On May 3, Sanders called Maradiaga into his office and fired him on the spot, 
Maradiaga said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said they could charge me with tampering" for making copies of the report, 
Maradiaga said. "He said I wasn't part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Farrell, an employment specialist with the federally funded Summer Youth 
Employment Training Program, said Maradiaga received good evaluations from his 
supervisors during the job program. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was concerned about Maradiaga's allegations because at least four 
other teen-agers helped clear rocks from the demolition site two days after 
bulldozers razed the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers have not yet been told about the matter because "we don't know 
if these kids were actually exposed to anything," she said. If prosecutors find 
that the youths came into contact with asbestos, she said they will be 
notified. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Sanders nor Arnold would comment on the events surrounding Maradiaga's 
termination, nor on whether teen-agers helped clear the site of debris. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold's attorney, Patricia Friedel, said Maradiaga's firing was "unrelated to 
the copying incident. There were legitimate reasons for his termination, but at 
this time we would rather not discuss personnel matters." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Patchett said Friday that he recently learned of 
Maradiaga's allegations and that the matter is under investigation. If it is 
learned that workers came into contact with asbestos without being properly 
advised of the hazards and without receiving proper protective gear, additional 
charges may be filed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that workers 
who come into contact with more than the permissible limit of asbestos use 
respirators, wear protective clothing, and receive instruction in the handling 
of asbestos and its hazards. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the current charges, both men face a minimum of $37,000 in 
fines. Patchett said he would seek minimum sentences of 90 days in jail for 
Arnold and 180 days in jail for Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Harold Hofmann told Maradiaga on Thursday that the City Council could do 
nothing to help him get back his job and that he would have to take his appeal 
elsewhere. Hofmann noted that Arnold is the only city employee hired directly 
by the council. All other hiring decisions ultimately are Arnold's 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Thursday night vote to pay legal fees for Arnold and Sanders, City 
Atty. David Aleshire told the council it has no obligation to pay for their 
defense because they are charged in a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
However, Aleshire said, if the council believes that the two men acted in good 
faith and within their scope as city employees in demolishing the buildings, it 
may choose to pay their legal fees.

PEREGRINE FALCON WINNING QUEST FOR SURVIVAL 
</P>

<P>
The peregrine falcon, once reduced to fewer than 100 pairs in the United 
States, is making a comeback as hundreds swoop off cliffs, ledges and, in many 
cases, skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 years and millions of dollars, conservationists say the birds soon 
won't need special protection, possibly by 1995. But they worry that Congress 
and others will decide that time is now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's progressed marvelously. It's probably not true that the bird is widely 
endangered now," said Jim Enderson, a Colorado College biologist who heads a 
federal peregrine recovery team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a model program nationally," said Brad Blodget, Massachusetts' state 
ornithologist. "It's a victory story." 
</P>
<P>
Within five years, Enderson said, the government could probably "down-list" the 
bird from endangered to threatened, or even take it off the lists altogether. 
</P>
<P>
This is big news for the peregrine. Once totaling about 300 pairs in the East 
and many more in the West, the falcon population was hard hit in the 1950s by 
DDT and other insecticides. By 1975, there were no falcons known to survive on 
the East Coast, and fewer than 100 pairs were counted in the entire continental 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically starting from zero," Blodget said. 
</P>
<P>
Groups such as the Boise, Ida.-based Peregrine Fund set about reintroducing the 
falcon, importing hatchlings from Canada, Scotland, Argentina and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, which banned DDT for nearly all purposes, earmarked 
about $300,000 a year for captive falcon breeding. Some states even put 
check-off options on tax forms to extend a portion of rebates to peregrine 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the efforts have cost "many millions of dollars," said Bill 
Burnham, president of the Peregrine Fund, which spends about $800,000 a year on 
peregrine recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot cheaper to take care of the environment, rather than trying to go 
in afterward and put them back after you lose them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon recovery cost so much in part because it entails more than just 
releasing an Argentine bird in Montana. Mortality rates are as high as 50% in 
the bird's first year, and remain at about 15% through its lifetime, Burnham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Peregrine Fund will release its 3,000th falcon this year, Burnham said. In 
California, where more than 500 birds were released in the 1980s, 90 pairs 
exist, up from eight pairs in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there are more than 540 falcon pairs in the United States. Almost 100 
pairs are in the Grand Canyon alone. In the Northeast, at least 85 pairs have 
been counted, while about 17 pairs are known in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the pesticide situation does not change for the worse, it's 
unlikely that this bird is going to be in trouble in the foreseeable future," 
Enderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Other conservationists are more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"We're about two-thirds of the way there," Burnham said. "As far as the release 
of the peregrines go, there's probably a need for another six to seven years." 
</P>
<P>
The birds remain scarce in some places, such as Idaho, where only three pairs 
are known. So, conservationists say, they are keeping anxious eyes on 
Washington, hoping Congress does not pull the plug too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the worst things you can do is put a lot of energy into restoration and 
then stop it," said Tom French, who heads the Massachusetts endangered species 
program. 
</P>
<P>
As they are reintroduced to modern society, some peregrines are showing a taste 
for urban life, where high-rise buildings resemble their preferred high cliffs 
and rocky ledges. 
</P>
<P>
Nine pairs swoop and dive among the skyscrapers and sloping bridges of New York 
City, while in Springfield, Mass., peregrines nesting on a 23-story building 
have become stars of a local cable television show. 
</P>
<P>
But with the falcon's new surroundings have come modern hazards such as high 
wires, airplanes and plate-glass windows. Conservationists say too many 
collisions with planes or decapitations by wires could cripple breeding 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year one of the adult males flew over the airport and was hit by an 
airplane and killed, right in the middle of breeding season," said Pat Redig, 
who heads the Midwest-based Raptor Center. "I've seen those things happen with 
enough frequency to cause me to be concerned about the fragility of our 
population."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: ABANDONED HOMES BECOME A CITY PERK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tim Waters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The term subsidized housing has taken on a new meaning in upscale Palos Verdes 
Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Jim Hendrickson, who became the community's city manager last fall 
with a contract that allows him to live rent-free in a bluff-top home with 
postcard views of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just amazing to sit in the living room and all you see is the ocean," 
Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
If Hendrickson stumbled onto a good deal, so did two city policemen who live on 
the same street. Their houses also are on the bluffs and have ocean views. The 
officers don't get free rent, but their contract with the city calls for them 
to make only $400 worth of improvements to their homes each month. 
</P>
<P>
The good housing deals have come about because of a dozen lawsuits filed 
against the city over the last decade. Residents of Palos Verdes Drive West, in 
an area known as Bluff Cove, alleged that their properties were undermined by 
water from a faulty city storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has vigorously defended itself, it has nevertheless found 
itself the reluctant owner of six homes. Three are occupied by the city 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
The city will take possession of the other three in future years under the 
terms of various legal settlements. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining half a dozen houses involved in the lawsuits, the city could 
wind up owning two more, depending on the outcome of litigation. Three were 
razed because they were uninhabitable, and another was kept by the owners as 
part of their legal settlement. 
</P>
<P>
City officials maintain that the three homes occupied by the employees are safe 
to live in, even though 20 to 30 feet of Hendrickson's back yard long ago fell 
over a cliff and into the ocean. The city's assurances notwithstanding, the 
houses sat vacant and became popular hangouts for transients and revelers until 
four years ago. That's when the two police officers inquired about living in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members, seeing a way to upgrade, maintain and provide security 
for the homes -- and provide housing for city employees who otherwise could not 
afford to live in the city -- went along with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making the best out of a bad situation," Councilwoman Ruth Gralow said. 
</P>
<P>
In Hendrickson's case, the city evicted a policewoman who had lived in the 
house for two years and offered it to him rent free, providing he would accept 
a salary lower than he would make elsewhere. Hendrickson agreed to accept 
$65,000 a year, a good $15,000 to $20,000 less than the city would have had to 
pay otherwise, Gralow said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson said he has put $11,800 of his own money into fixing up the house, 
installing new plumbing, carpets, blinds and wallpaper. With the rent-free 
house came a clause in his contract requiring him to be available around the 
clock. A direct telephone line to the Police Department has been installed in 
the home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told a number of people I am never going to live in as nice a home 
again," said Hendrickson, who was formerly San Clemente's city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Dave Black, one of the two policemen who originally approached the city 
about living in the homes, said his house was a "basic fixer-upper" when he 
moved into it. Because he was a construction worker before he became a police 
officer, he had the skills to do the work himself, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Darin Kasten, who lives next door to Black, said his home had sat 
vacant for seven years before he moved in. The windows had all been broken out 
and the floors destroyed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like an open shell," Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
Under their contracts with the city, Hendrickson and the officers have agreed 
not to hold the city liable should the land become unstable. (All three said 
they do not worry about that happening.) 
</P>
<P>
And although Hendrickson will not be forced to move as long as he is city 
manager, no such security is offered to the police officers. Their housing 
contracts with the city can be canceled any month. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some city officials have suggested that the houses, located in a 
neighborhood where dwellings easily sell for seven figures, could be used to 
entice other top administrators to the city. But if that happens, Black said, 
he will have no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"If they asked me to leave tomorrow, I would be happy because I have had four 
good years." Tim Waters

TAKING A FLYING LEAP? BUNGEE JUMPERS DO IT

<TEXT>
<P>
Jumping from a hot air balloon 150 feet in the sky with an elastic cord 
attached to a harness around your middle is an unforgettable adrenaline rush. 
</P>
<P>
The world's first commercial hot air balloon bungee jumpers, about 60 
thrill-seekers who recently gathered in a Northern California cow pasture, say 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
They came from cities across the country to pay the Palo Alto-based Bungee 
Adventure company $99 for one jump and a video record of the feat. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Newton, 21, a security guard from Richmond, Calif., became the first 
recorded paying customer to make a bungee jump from a hot air balloon at 
daybreak on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you scared?" ground supporters called to him while the green, yellow, 
black, red and orange balloon ascended. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The group on the ground began chanting, "5, 4, 3, 2, 1!" 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the countdown, Newton hurled himself into space. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeeehaa!" he screamed, dangling triumphantly from the cord seconds later. "I'm 
a born bungee baby!" 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a satisfied Yo-Yo," said a beaming John Kockelman, 30, who founded 
Bungee Adventure along with his brother, Pete, 32. 
</P>
<P>
After the lunge earthward, the jumper is lowered to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Kockelmans, leaders among pioneer bungee jumpers, got into the sport in 
October, 1987, doing it for fun in the beginning from bridges, buildings, giant 
cranes and redwood trees. 
</P>
<P>
Bungee jumping hot spots also can be found in Australia, where a group has 
conducted about 23,000 jumps off bridges, and in France, where two 
thrill-seekers fell to their deaths last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Kockelmans went commercial in May, 1988, and have supervised more than 
9,000 bungee jumps off bridges. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a better platform when we hit upon the idea of jumping 
from a hot air balloon," John said. 
</P>
<P>
Pete obtained a pilot's license and the brothers invested in a $20,000 balloon, 
then added another $10,000 in special reinforcing safety features needed for 
bungee jumping. 
</P>
<P>
"No one else in the entire world is doing hot air balloon bungee jumping 
commercially," John said. 
</P>
<P>
With very little advertising, the Kockelmans' balloon is already booked into 
July. 
</P>
<P>
What does it feel like to leap from a hot air balloon? 
</P>
<P>
My jump, known as "The Flight of the Pudgy Eagle," found some answers. 
</P>
<P>
I can report that first comes terror -- during that finite moment your weight 
shifts forward, away from the swaying balloon basket -- as every nerve in your 
body screams, "Don't do this!" 
</P>
<P>
Seconds after the inexorable plunge toward hostile Earth, terror gives way to 
the giggles as the jumper hits the end of his 43-foot-long bungee cord and it 
stretches, slowing that awful fall and doubling to 86 feet in length. 
</P>
<P>
Next comes a whacking great rebound -- boing-g-g-g, and another, boing-g-g-g -- 
high above terra firma. 
</P>
<P>
The giggles are nearly unstoppable as you bob up down like a human yo-yo.

CONSIDER NEEDS OF ALL STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Manhattan Beach resident since 1947 and having had two girls complete 
their education in this area, I have seen school issues change from year to 
year. However, the one issue which keeps reoccurring is school unification. 
</P>
<P>
The one priority many seem to overlook is: What is best for all children, not 
just mine. 
</P>
<P>
A full unification would be more beneficial to all children because of a more 
consistent program and better articulation between schools, staff and support 
staff in the K-12 years. Plus, there is the opportunity and more availability 
of a proven Adult School Parent Education program involving parents and 
children from prenatal to 5-year-olds. It is one of the better preventive 
programs offered anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The cost-effectiveness of unification in regard to purchasing, maintenance, 
salaries, administrative costs and duplication of services is a big factor. All 
of these would enable the district to offer educational opportunities and 
extracurricular activities not now available to all children. The neighborhood 
school . . . walking distance . . . can be maintained with possible 
inter-school transfers available. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is: Let's think of the positive aspects for 10,000 children who 
are indeed our future.

CITY CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO KEEP HEAT ON; 
</P>
<P>
ANAHEIM WAS WINNING WAR ON CRIME IN JEFFREY-LYNNE -- NOW IS NO TIME TO RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A six-month pilot program to step up law enforcement in Anaheim's troubled 
Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood -- known by its residents as "Tijuanita," or Little 
Tijuana -- ended this spring. Some say that the concentrated foot patrols and 
mobile units made a lasting difference. 
</P>
<P>
Others fear that the old criminal activity, which had dipped during the pilot 
project, is creeping back. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that Anaheim says it can't afford to keep up the special level 
of policing in one area. It's reassigning the unit of five officers to target 
10 neighborhoods that have high crime rates, including Jeffrey-Lynne. But the 
success of the Jeffrey-Lynne project makes it clear just how valuable such a 
concentration of effort was for the community. At the risk of losing all 
progress, there's really no turning back. There may be some middle ground 
possible -- say, fewer officers than before but better organized and trained 
neighborhood watch groups to work with police. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey-Lynne -- a five-square-block area near the Disneyland Hotel -- was 
chosen for the pilot program because it's one of Anaheim's worst crime and 
poverty pockets. Families were crowded into run-down apartments amid 
drug-dealing, prostitution and other criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
The community policing unit put residents, many of whom were without telephones 
or were afraid, within easy reach of police help. At the same time the policing 
program was launched, the city boosted other services. Building inspectors 
found 5,000 code violations and ordered landlords to make repairs. A social 
services office was opened. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the city's effort, residents felt safer. A police officer 
driving through in a patrol car reported that people waved, a sign residents 
who were once suspicious of police now welcome them. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a sign for the city. It should find a way to continue its successful 
community policing program in Jeffrey-Lynne.

NRA AND GUNS: WHY DOESN'T THE PRESS DISCUSS CAR CONTROL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a woman member of the National Rifle Assn., I take extreme exception to Ron 
Ekard's letter to the editor (June 20). 
</P>
<P>
He claims that the Second Amendment only covers firearms that were around when 
the Bill of Rights was written. 
</P>
<P>
Using his logic, the First Amendment does not cover any electronic media, any 
newspaper printed on a high-speed printing press or anything spoken over a 
microphone because they were not yet invented when our country was founded. And 
the Fourth Amendment does not protect you from having your automobile searched 
because they were not around in 1789. 
</P>
<P>
Let me remind him that the Second Amendment was not written with sporting 
purposes in mind, but with the right of the people to protect themselves, their 
families and, above all else, their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
As Thomas Jefferson said, "The strongest reason for the people to retain the 
right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against 
tyranny in government." 
</P>
<P>
If, God forbid, someday in the future our government becomes oppressive, they 
won't be using single-shot, cap-and-ball pistols.

THE MONORAIL IS NO PIPE DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On May 29, the Irvine City Council finally approved the half-mile monorail 
project for McDonnell Douglas Realty Co. 
</P>
<P>
On June 9, the headline on a Los Angeles Times story read: "County Says Airport 
Monorail Ad Is Premature." 
</P>
<P>
And on June 17, the public received additional wisdom from a Times editorial: 
"Dreams of a Monorail and Reality: Irvine's Plan for a Half-Mile Link to 
Airport Deserves Study, but Details Are Needed." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently some in the community expect immediate results. Once we received 
approval, they expected to be riding on the monorail almost overnight, like one 
of those homes that's built in 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I am sorry to say it just doesn't work that way. 
</P>
<P>
Also, I wasn't aware that we should continue studying the monorail. Instead, we 
went immediately into design drawings and, frankly, we are ready to pour 
concrete right now. 
</P>
<P>
But our recent ad in The Times did one wonderful thing: It got our message and 
an illustration of our beautiful monorail and twin 23-story office towers (the 
tallest ever built in Orange County) to the public. 
</P>
<P>
And boy, did they respond. Of more than 500 responses we received, only one was 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
We never anticipated the outpouring of sentiment and enthusiasm that we got 
from a tiny coupon in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
Our monorail constructor, the Transportation Group Inc., has the design of the 
cars and the equipment well under way. Just last week, I inspected some of 
their beautiful new cars at Walt Disney World. These cars handle almost 200,000 
people a day, more than Bay Area Rapid Transit in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
So you see, fortunately, we are dealing in reality, in concrete and steel and 
electrical equipment that has already been tried and proven and that will soon 
be in operation. And, by the way, George Rebella and the airport staff couldn't 
be more cooperative. They're on the monorail train saying "full speed ahead." 
</P>
<P>
I just read where we are close to getting a $1-million federal grant for a 
five-city monorail study. And, of course, the passage of Proposition 116 
providing $125 million for the city of Irvine is a giant step forward. 
</P>
<P>
But I know what you are all saying: "I will believe it when I see it." 
</P>
<P>
I urge The Times to keep a sharp eye on the foundations and guideway at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Close your eyes tightly and dream of a world without smog and gridlock, but 
instead filled with silver, silent, gliding vehicles transporting the rich and 
the poor in air-conditioned comfort. 
</P>
<P>
A mirage may appear in the form of an actual car on top of the guideway. This 
beautiful vision will become reality later this year with the installation of 
the initial guideway.

BRINGING BALANCE INTO THE LIFE OF YOUR 'FAST-FORWARD' CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY STARK, Dr. Amy Stark is a clinical psychologist in Tustin who 
specializes in child and family therapy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many Americans seem obsessed with activity -- cramming as much into each hour 
as possible. No one leaves home without a date book, which is filled to the 
brim with activities, luncheons and business meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But what is our hectic, high-tech lifestyle doing to our children? 
</P>
<P>
As we rush along, we also pull them with us, encouraging them to participate in 
every activity we can possibly squeeze into their and our schedules. 
</P>
<P>
A typical week goes something like this: Jane has Girl Scouts on Monday night, 
piano lessons on Wednesday and religious instruction Thursday after school. 
John has an appointment with the orthodontist Monday before school, basketball 
practice afterward three days, and a game on Saturday. In between, there are 
homework, science projects and school activities. "Free time" is taken up with 
Nintendo, television and VCR viewing. 
</P>
<P>
With the increase of double-income homes, we are raising our children to be 
independent, self-sufficient beings who can survive without us most of the 
time. Although this has nice aspects, a price is paid. Such children sometimes 
grow up not respecting others or valuing the thoughtful, appreciative 
characteristics we do not have the time to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
Thank-you notes, saying "please," and some of the other human niceties are left 
by the wayside. We don't have time for those extras. Instead we push for upward 
mobility, appearances, participation in activities, good grades, winning and 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Although we would like to think that we encourage our children to display 
manners and think of other's needs, many of the activities we emphasize, such 
as winning in sports and achieving good grades, do not have community service 
or humanitarian aspects. True, such endeavors do give our kids valuable lessons 
in team play and peer interaction, but they don't teach them to help someone 
besides themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, your family may be different, and you do encourage your children to 
demonstrate basic human values such as respect for others. Realize, however, 
that our society has the capability of undermining your efforts as fast as you 
make them. Our hectic lifestyle takes its toll in many ways in which we may not 
be aware. 
</P>
<P>
Out of our fast-paced world has come high-tech entertainment. The games our 
children play require little parental input and often do not even encourage 
interaction among players. Nintendo, video arcades, VCR home viewing and 
computer games can all be done solo. Some of these activities are even 
addictive in nature, much like slot machines in Las Vegas. Children become so 
engrossed that they often lose all track of time as they attempt to top their 
own scores. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that games like Nintendo don't have benefits. True, they do 
encourage hand-eye coordination and dexterity, but our children are missing 
some wonderful opportunities if Nintendo is their only form of recreation. 
</P>
<P>
A teacher recently told me she planned on going out to play with her children 
at recess because they don't seem to know how to play hopscotch, foursquare or 
marbles. Instead, they wander around aimlessly, unable to create fun from the 
world around them. Children must be taught to play -- to look up at the sky and 
see animals in the clouds, to whistle through a blade of grass. 
</P>
<P>
So how do we help our children achieve balance between technology and 
maintenance of human values? 
</P>
<P>
Balance is the operative word here. To fit in today, knowledge of our high-tech 
world is required. Kids do need to know about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and 
how to play Tetris or Super Mario Land. Fitting in does not mean obsession, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of one of my patients recently complained that her son's grades went 
into rapid decline when the family got Nintendo. The problem wasn't Nintendo, 
however. The problem was that he was allowed unlimited access to the game and 
spent hours mesmerized by it. Once he was limited to 30 minutes a day after 
homework, his grades improved considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Balance also means taking a look at the number of activities in which your 
child participates. A standard rule of thumb is two nights of activity per 
week, with perhaps some Saturday involvement. 
</P>
<P>
When children are too busy, they often experience distress. One such 
"fast-forward" child was in an activity every day after school. She had piano, 
tutoring, Girl Scouts and religious training. Initially, she seemed to thrive 
from all of the stimulation, but over the long haul she became tired, had 
difficulty sleeping and suffered from depression. The demands on her time were 
too much for her. 
</P>
<P>
Although every child is different, don't assume that since you can handle a 
busy schedule, your child can too. If you are divorced and your child is being 
shuttled between parents, don't forget to consider the additional stress this 
causes. Perhaps this should be considered one of his or her two activities for 
a while. 
</P>
<P>
Structure provides a nice safety net for children. It creates spaces in which 
they can grow and learn. Once again, balance is important. Your child needs 
some free time, too. Ensure that such time is well used by providing 
parameters. Limit Nintendo time and encourage development of some other game 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Also, allow your child time to read, think, dream, be. If you value occasional 
quiet time, your child will also. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot change our entire world, but we can improve our corner of it. By 
helping our children create balance in their lives, they become well-rounded 
and self-assured -- not overworked and overwrought. Eventually they will bring 
that inner balance into our outer world. 
</P>
<P>
Give your child time to think about the sky, question why a spider has eight 
legs or dream of participating in the space program. The results will enrich us 
all.

BEST MCCOLL DUMP OPTION: CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As stated in an editorial (June 3), the time for action at the McColl Disposal 
Site in Fullerton is now. The endless studies and delays surrounding McColl 
must turn to decisive action designed to deal with waste at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Fullerton community members living near McColl hosted a meeting to 
hear and discuss the Stabilization and Closure Plan proposed by the five oil 
companies that form the McColl Site Group. 
</P>
<P>
MSG believes this plan would be the most protective of public health, the 
quickest to implement and the least disruptive to the community. Of all the 
alternatives the Environmental Protection Agency is considering, closure 
provides the highest level of protection at the lowest cost. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Stabilization and Closure Plan proposed by MSG protects the public 
health and environment by avoiding the massive disturbance of wastes that 
thermal destruction engenders. The plan involves an emissions treatment system, 
reinforcement against earthquakes, waste stabilization and treatment, and 
drinking-water protection by means of a cover and underground walls. 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes landscaping the site to provide a parklike setting and 
provides for long-term operation and maintenance activities. Closure is an 
alternative that has been used successfully elsewhere under similar conditions, 
and it meets all EPA, state and local regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The sentiment of many people attending the May 24 community meeting was clear: 
The closure plan has merit and should be selected by the EPA. Above all, the 
community said, let's stop delays, move forward and resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Our differences lie in the method of dealing with the waste: excavation and 
thermal destruction versus stabilization and closure. The EPA favors the 
former, MSG the latter. Excavation and thermal destruction could take 10 or 
more years to complete; stabilization and closure could take only 20 months, 
while being most protective of public health. 
</P>
<P>
Excavating tons of waste and then placing a huge incinerator in the midst of a 
highly populated area in the nation's worst air-pollution basin defies logic. 
Not only does excavation and thermal destruction pose a potential air-pollution 
problem, but it is the highest-cost alternative with the highest potential risk 
to public health, cleanup workers and the community. Closure, on the other 
hand, leaves the wastes mostly undisturbed and, therefore, results in little 
risk.

MAYOR LOST FOR A GOOD REASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was surprised to learn that Cameron Cosgrove is a Republican ("Is Pioneering 
Spirit History in Irvine?" June 18). 
</P>
<P>
And he's right that it shouldn't matter in a nonpartisan race, but it was Mayor 
Larry Agran and City Councilman Cosgrove more than any others who turned Irvine 
politics into partisan, nationally oriented politics. 
</P>
<P>
And now he has the gall to complain. It's not surprising that Cosgrove was 
ignored in the campaign. Except for Sally Anne Sheridan, the council was a 
rubber stamp for Agran. Irvine voters didn't like that. 
</P>
<P>
As for his being a Republican, in contrast to his Democrat-flavored words and 
actions, it only reinforces the old saying, "There isn't a dime's worth of 
difference!" Of course, I say that from the viewpoint of a Libertarian.

PERSPECTIVE MISSING IN CANYON FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not surprising that the feud between two neighbors over a canyon adjacent 
to their property (June 6) should elicit a great deal of response. But to 
castigate the family involved is to lack the perspective needed to judge their 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Gary and Charlene Dapelo received permits and went through planning reviews 
like any other citizen. They did not build a toxic factory; they built a grass 
field surrounded by trees. 
</P>
<P>
There are probably not a dozen people in all of Orange County who could locate 
the canyon in question. It is neither visible to, nor usable by, the public. 
The reason? The above portion of the canyon was filled in to build roads nearly 
30 years ago and homes up the canyon have all but obliterated it. 
</P>
<P>
This was not an untouched priceless ecosystem; it was the last remnant of a 
geological formation that has been destroyed acre by acre over the last three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Dapelos' action is a microcosm of Orange County's development, similar to 
the building in Laguna Canyon, the oak grove in San Clemente or the stretch of 
once pristine coastline between Corona del Mar and Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of California's open spaces is understandably mourned. But it is the 
responsibility of the governing bodies to review the laws and represent the 
people. Mr. Dapelo went through the proper procedures; he did not ignore or 
subvert the process. It seems unfair to penalize him for what he was given full 
entitlement to do.

THE $115,000 RACING SHELLS FOR NEWPORT AQUATIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article (June 13) on Amateur Athletic Foundation funding in Orange County 
featured a great photo of the junior women's quad boat from the Newport Aquatic 
Center. These girls will be going on to national-level competition later this 
month and, hopefully, also will continue to row at the high school and 
collegiate level. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to point out that the Newport Aquatic Center offers the only 
opportunity for any woman of any age to row in all of Orange County. The two 
collegiate programs in Orange County, at UC Irvine and Orange Coast College, 
both offer men's teams but do not have rowing programs available to women. 
There are no other high school rowing programs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Newport Aquatic Center is marginally able to keep its doors open 
from month to month on its membership fees, it is only through the generosity 
of organizations such as the AAF and the donations of individuals that programs 
like this one for high school kids can be offered. The article makes reference 
to lessons being offered for $50, while failing to mention that this is the 
cost of a five-lesson series. 
</P>
<P>
It is the purpose of the Newport Aquatic Center to promote the sports of 
kayaking, canoeing and rowing at all levels of ability, and the center is 
wheelchair-accessible.

INMATE DEATH ATTRIBUTED TO NATURAL CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 42-year-old man who was in sheriff's custody died Saturday in Tri-City 
Medical Center in Oceanside, apparently of natural causes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Raymond Albert Brinkerhoff, an Oceanside truck 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
Brinkerhoff had been in sheriff's custody since March 28 on drug and weapons 
charges, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
On June 15, the spokeswoman said, authorities transported him from the county 
jail in Vista to Tri-City Hospital after he had vomited blood and complained of 
abdominal pains. He had a history of bleeding ulcers and a cancerous throat 
condition, according to the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
Brinkerhoff suffered cardiac failure in the hospital early Saturday and was 
pronounced dead at 5:37 a.m., said a spokesman for the county Medical 
Examiner's office.

ENCINITAS GIRL, 4, DROWNS IN POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 4-year-old Encinitas girl died Saturday, an apparent drowning victim, after 
losing consciousness while playing in shallow water in a community pool, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Elizabeth Mealy. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was playing in three feet of water in an Encinitas pool when she began 
to drown about 10:30 a.m., possibly after she hit her head on the bottom, said 
a spokesman for the San Diego County Medical Examiner's office. Her mother was 
nearby, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to revive the girl were unsuccessful, and she succumbed about an hour 
later at Scripps Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
She was the 10th youth age 14 or under to die because of an apparent drowning 
in San Diego County thus far in 1990, said Mark Morelli, a spokesman for 
Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Morelli said the number of drownings and near-drownings among area children has 
increased but that he does not know the reason.

NAVRATILOVA GETS WARMED UP, 6-0, 6-2

<TEXT>
<P>
Martina Navratilova is hoping that nine is her lucky number. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova needed only 45 minutes to win the Eastbourne grass-court title for 
the ninth time Saturday, and now she will set her sights on an unprecedented 
ninth Wimbledon title. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova trounced Gretchen Magers, 6-0, 6-2, allowing her opponent only 24 
points in blustery conditions at Eastbourne, England. 
</P>
<P>
"She shouldn't feel humiliated," Navratilova said. "She didn't play badly -- 
everything just went my way. She didn't lose it, I won it." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova showed no signs of the knee problem that required treatment during 
Friday's semifinal win over Jana Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt really nimble and light on my feet," she said. "The knee felt better 
today than for months. Today my knees felt like they were 15. Yesterday they 
felt 50." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Sampras beat Gilad Bloom of Israel, 7-6, 7-6, to win his first grass-court 
title at Manchester, England. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Californian, the youngest player to win an ATP event this year, 
took the tiebreakers by scores of 11-9 and 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras wasted four set points before finally winning the first tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Games again went with serve in the second set until Sampras trailed, 5-4, and, 
0-40, on his serve. He won the next five points and tied it again, 6-6, then 
won the tiebreaker and the match. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Forget won the all-French final of a grass-court tournament at Wentworth, 
England, by getting past Henri Leconte, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"The court was a bit soft, but if I can play well on that it's a good omen for 
Wimbledon, where the courts are perfect," Forget said. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are going just right for me at the moment. I'm at my highest world 
ranking of 20 and have been seeded at Wimbledon for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Forget, seeded 11th at Wimbledon, beat John McEnroe and Jonas Svensson on his 
way to the championship match. 
</P>
<P>
The match ended spectacularly, with Forget serving three consecutive aces to 
reach match point. 
</P>
<P>
Forget double-faulted on triple set point before blistering another serve that 
Leconte could only return into the net.

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
* Battle Lines: Commissioner Fay Vincent and New York Yankee owner George 
Steinbrenner are bringing in heavy artillery in preparation for a July 5 
hearing on the investigation into Steinbrenner's relationship with alleged 
gambler Howard Spira. Vincent has put former federal judge Harold Tyler on 
retainer, while Steinbrenner has hired two former federal prosecutors, Stephen 
Kaufman and Dominic Amorosa, as part of his legal team. The maximum penalties 
for violating the best interest of baseball are suspension for life and a fine 
of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Atlanta Burning: Russ Nixon's final days as the Atlanta Braves' manager 
included open warfare with several of his players and a loss of communication 
with some of his coaches. The ineffectiveness of a touted young rotation and 
the illness that sidelined Nick Esasky undermined what Nixon and others hoped 
would be a promising season. And there was no relief anywhere. Nixon tried 
seven pitchers in the closer role, and his bullpen blew 12 of 25 save chances, 
earning the nickname "Ghastly Boys" from Joe Strauss of the Atlanta 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
* Security Check: General Manager Dal Maxvill of the St. Louis Cardinals 
received a contract extension through 1992, which matches the commitment to 
Manager Whitey Herzog. Only three players -- Bryn Smith, Jose DeLeon and Milt 
Thompson -- are signed through '92, and 11 Cardinals can become free agents 
when this season ends. "We're entering a transition period," Maxvill said. 
"Some will leave by trade, some by choice, some by an infusion of young 
talent." Amid the current struggle, pitcher John Tudor said the Cardinals have 
been feeling sorry for themselves, adding: "We have to turn frustration into 
aggression instead of more frustration." 
</P>
<P>
* Dollar Daze: Jose Canseco's contract agreement with the Oakland Athletics 
will cover five years and fall between $23 million and $23.7 million. A's 
General Manager Sandy Alderson denied that the Oakland Coliseum fences will be 
moved in five feet as part of the agreement. ROSS NEWHAN

RUNNING DOWN THE FANS' ALL-STAR VOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the popularity contest that is the All-Star election, Wade Boggs, Ozzie 
Smith and Cal Ripken Jr. appear to be retaining their traditional starting 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
These are the most glaring injustices in the 1990 process. 
</P>
<P>
With voting for the July 10 game at Chicago's Wrigley Field scheduled to end 
July 2, it is time for a progress report, to evaluate what new damage the 
paying patrons have wrought. Here is one man's opinion: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
First base -- Mark McGwire is No. 1 in the voting and having an All-Star year. 
Unfortunately, it pales compared to that of Cecil Fielder, who is No. 3 in the 
voting and should be No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Second base -- It's an off year for second basemen in the AL. Steve Sax and 
Julio Franco are first and second in the voting. Statistically, they probably 
should be reversed -- and, anyway, the honor probably should go to transplanted 
Jody Reed, a shortstop on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop -- As much as Ripken's durability and defensive play are to be 
admired, he has been a .220 hitter for most of the season. Ozzie Guillen and 
Alan Trammell should be 1-2 but are 4-6 in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
Third base -- At a fluctuating .270 to .290, well below his career average, 
Boggs simply can't be automatic here, particularly when Kelly Gruber, second in 
the voting, is superior in every category and even giving Fielder competition 
for the runs batted in title. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher -- Terry Steinbach has been one of the league's hottest hitters in June 
and may deserve his No. 1 status by July 2, but at this point, Lance Parrish, 
seventh in the voting; Pat Borders, sixth, and Sandy Alomar, second, should be 
ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
Outfield -- Can't argue with the electorate's first three of Jose Canseco, 
Rickey Henderson and Ken Griffey Jr. One oversight: Ivan Calderon should be 
higher than 14th. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
First base -- Either Will Clark or Glenn Davis is an appropriate choice. The 
fans are opting for Clark. Davis is sixth, way too low. 
</P>
<P>
Second base -- Ryne Sandberg is as clear-cut as it gets, but it's nice to see 
the fans recognize two rising young players, Delino DeShields and Roberto 
Alomar, who are justifiably 2-3 in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop -- No apology is needed, but Smith just isn't the wizard he once was. 
Barry Larkin, second in the voting, should be No. 1, and Shawon Dunston and 
Jose Uribe also should also be ahead of Ozzie. 
</P>
<P>
Third base -- It's hard to separate Chris Sabo, Tim Wallach and Matt Williams. 
They are 1-3-4 in the voting, and Sabo seems a legitimate choice at the moment, 
but the charging Williams might be the right choice by July 2. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher -- Fans were been doing it right, with Benito Santiago No. 1 and Mike 
Scioscia No. 2. Then Santiago broke his arm when hit by a pitch, leaving 
Scioscia the best of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Outfield -- Andre Dawson and Kevin Mitchell are fine as 1-2 in the voting. The 
fans have Tony Gwynn third, which isn't bad, but either Bobby Bonilla, who is 
fourth, or Lenny Dykstra, now sixth, would be a stronger choice. The biggest 
balloting mistake: Joe Carter, vying with Williams for the NL's RBI lead, is 
16th among outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
When relief ace Mark Davis rejected their four-year, $12-million offer and 
moved to the Kansas City Royals as a free agent, the San Diego Padres had to go 
to $5.35 million to sign free agent Craig Lefferts to a three-year contract as 
Davis' replacement. Lefferts has proved to be a money-saving bargain and a 
better pitcher than Davis -- based, at least, on the latter's performance with 
the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts has a 5-1 record, 10 saves in 11 chances and a 1.36 earned-run 
average. He has stranded the last 19 runners he inherited and 21 of 23 for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants, Lefferts' former team, won nine consecutive games and 
16 of 17 before Lefferts saved Tuesday night's 4-3 San Diego victory, then 
pitched 2 1/3 shutout innings to get credit for Wednesday's 4-3 victory in 
which San Francisco closer Steve Bedrosian took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I bet the Giants wish they had him back," San Diego Manager Jack McKeon said 
of Lefferts. Said Giant Manager Roger Craig: "It's not like we didn't want him 
back. He's no surprise. He's pitching well and has a chance to make my All-Star 
team." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants may have wanted him back but never made more than a two-year offer, 
which is why the fans booed, he believes, when he made his Candlestick Park 
appearances last week. 
</P>
<P>
"They were booing (Giant President) Al Rosen, that's the way I looked at it," 
Lefferts said. 
</P>
<P>
American League owners, meeting recently in Cleveland, quietly voted to outlaw 
the eye-in-the-sky, the system by which a coach or a club official sits in the 
press box and positions the defense via a telephone to the dugout. The ban 
stemmed from charges by the Baltimore Orioles that the Chicago White Sox 
positioned their eye at ground level to help steal signs. The National League 
will continue to permit a roving eye. 
</P>
<P>
Burdened with too many outfielders -- too few of whom, if any, are complete 
players at this point in their careers -- Angel Manager Doug Rader has 
attempted a judicious juggling act, but the burial of Dante Bichette seems a 
sad and costly byproduct of the acquisition of Dave Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette had started every game but one when Winfield arrived on May 18. He was 
leading the league in outfield assists and batting .281 with four home runs and 
20 RBIs, a pace that projected to more than 20 homers and 100 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, Bichette has started only 17 of 35 games through Friday. 
His average had dropped to .252. A power hitter who needs regular employment, 
he has one hit in his last 25 at-bats, four in his last 38. 
</P>
<P>
There are questions that beg to be answered. Did Bichette develop terminal 
flaws between May 17 and 18? Did the promise, the potential, the productivity 
suddenly disappear? Why was there no explanation? It's a mystery, but then so 
is the continued employment of Devon White, whose trade value is now nil. 
</P>
<P>
While Bichette sits, White has started every game but three since May 18. Yes, 
he can play a position that the Angels believe Bichette can't, and that is 
important, but White has yet to prove he can adequately fill a position in the 
batting order. First or ninth, it is always the same. He had eight hits in his 
last 50 at-bats through Friday and a .211 average. Oh well, it is only his 10th 
season in pro ball and his fifth with the Angels. The miracle may happen by the 
turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Bichette seemed in the process of making something happen, 
before the plug was pulled. 
</P>
<P>
Strange business.

BOLDT BRIGHTENS WEST'S OUTLOOK IN 10-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITTORIO TAFUR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Sean Boldt had played in the shadow of teammate Pat Treend for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, with not even a vestige of shade at the sun-drenched El Camino Real 
High field, the right-handed pitcher made the most of his chance to shine, 
scattering seven hits and six walks in Woodland Hills West's 10-0 victory over 
Panorama City in an American Legion District 20 game. The win evened the 
defending Legion World Series champion's record at 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 168-pound Boldt, who will be a senior this fall at El Camino Real, 
watched Treend, the City Section 4-A Division co-Player of the Year, and Ryan 
McGuire combine for a 19-2 record in leading El Camino Real to the City 4-A 
championship game. Boldt played right field the last half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel lost in right field," said Boldt, who pitched 2 2/3 innings without 
giving up a run for the Conquistadores this past season. "There's nobody to 
talk to." 
</P>
<P>
It seems he might have found himself on the mound. Only in the top of the sixth 
inning was Boldt in any real trouble against Panorama City, and by that time, 
his offense had given him a 7-0 lead. After surrendering a double, walk and an 
infield single, Boldt (1-1) got Panorama City's Robert Kite to ground into a 
4-6-3 double play. That was effectively the last breath for Panorama City 
(9-3). West scored two more runs in the seventh and one more in the eighth 
before the 10-run rule was called into effect. 
</P>
<P>
West Coach Don Hornback was pleased with Boldt's performance in light of his 
limited work. 
</P>
<P>
"Boldt was wonderful today," Hornback said. "He didn't even pitch three innings 
all year and he throws like this. He is such a good athlete that he could get 
up out of bed in the middle of December and throw strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Geller led West's offense with a single, double and three walks. Jason 
Cohen and Del Marine added home runs.

BASKETBALL: REELING FROM COACH'S EXIT, TARDY CAVALIERS REBOUND TO BEAT 
INGLEWOOD.

<P>
Cleveland High assistant coach Bort Escoto could have been forgiven if he felt 
lost Saturday. His team certainly appeared to be. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes after the scheduled 1 p.m. tip-off time for Cleveland's first-round 
contest against Inglewood in the L.A. Games, only four Cavaliers were present 
at El Camino College's south gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Already frustrated and confused by first-year Coach Marc Paez's sudden 
departure two weeks ago, the eighth-seeded Cavaliers were within five minutes 
of forfeiting. Escoto, temporarily put in charge when Paez resigned, kept a 
watchful eye on the scoreboard clock. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, I feel terrible," Escoto said. "They won't allow us to play four on 
five. They're going to make us forfeit." 
</P>
<P>
As Escoto shook his head, a group of Cavaliers arrived. Apparently they had 
been hindered by traffic on the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Cavaliers had donned their black and red jerseys, they went about 
their business in much the same way they have produced one of the area's most 
successful programs. 
</P>
<P>
They used a quick, aggressive defense to force 20 turnovers and played well 
enough on offense to hand Inglewood a 58-51 defeat. Cleveland will meet 
Cypress, a 49-41 winner over Duarte, today at 11 a.m. If Cleveland wins, it 
will play again at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers did not play as well as Escoto would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
Lackadaisical rebounding allowed Inglewood 17 second chances that kept the 
Sentinels within striking distance, and Cleveland added 15 turnovers. Escoto 
said he did not feel comfortable until the Cavaliers had put together a 12-2 
spurt for a 56-48 lead with 16 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
But, in light of the team's woes, Escoto finds it difficult to expect much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most people think we're down and out. They think that, mentally, we 
might not be as stable as we have been," Escoto said. "We might not be, but we 
have to prove that we're still Cleveland High. We're playing for school pride 
and the team's sake." 
</P>
<P>
That might be more difficult than it has been in the past. Only four varsity 
players return and the Cavaliers lack their traditional speed, size and talent. 
</P>
<P>
But there was talent enough to baffle Inglewood. Forward Brandon Martin scored 
a game-high 28 points and guard Kenny Collins played flawlessly down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
After Martin's three-point play gave Cleveland a 48-46 lead, Collins hit a jump 
shot, fed Martin for a layup and hit both ends of a one-and-one with 0:23 left 
to extend Cleveland's lead to 56-48. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in shock when Coach Paez quit," said forward Kahyeed Murray. "We were 
just getting comfortable with him and 'Boom!' We have to do this all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Murray echoed his teammates, who say the situation has been tempered by a good 
relationship with Escoto. A former Cavalier who has been an assistant at 
Cleveland for five seasons, Escoto has worked with many of the Cavaliers since 
they were freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Escoto, however, is hesitant to initiate his coaching philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really be myself because somebody new could come in and change the 
whole thing," Escoto said. "In fact, (a new head coach) could even get rid of 
me as an assistant, so I'm holding back a little."

BLANKENSHIP STAYS HOT IN MAIN EVENT AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Blankenship of Reseda had a feeling that his summer racing days would be 
scorching indeed when he came within one one-hundredth of a second of the 
Street Stock division one-lap oval record in qualifying races Saturday at 
Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
His time of 18.55 seconds was just shy of the mark of 18.54 set by Rick Crow of 
Canyon Country in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on a roll," Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
So Blankenship's Street Stock main-event win in front of 4,400 was no surprise. 
It was just a continuation of his hot driving. 
</P>
<P>
"I credit it to a good old car," he said. "This car's been around this track a 
lot of times. It's been racing out here about 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship took the lead for good on Turn 2 in Lap 6 when he sneaked past John 
Kirby of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"You take what you can get," Blankenship said. "You don't think. You just do 
it. If the opportunity is there, you just do it." 
</P>
<P>
The win was Blankenship's first in a main event this season. Craig Rayburn of 
Simi Valley finished second, with Kirby third. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sportsman division main event, John Cran of Reseda defied a recent 
Saugus trend in his 40-lap win. 
</P>
<P>
In the last eight Sportsman races, the pole-position car never relinquished its 
lead. But on Laps 24 and 25, Cran pressured leader Rayburn with attempts to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Turn 2 and the back straightaway of Lap 26, Cran whizzed past Rayburn 
-- much to the delight of his fluorescent green-clad rooting section -- and 
stayed in front for his third main-event win this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taking a helluva chance," Cran said amid backslaps from his pit crew. 
"But I figured, it's now or never. Let's go for it." 
</P>
<P>
Cran said that the track was slippery from a bang-up involving several cars, 
including points leader Will Harper of Tarzana. As a result, Rayburn could not 
drive exceedingly fast in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Rayburn, who raced in three main events Saturday night, finished second. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier races, Garrett Yamada of North Hollywood started fast glided to an 
uncontested win in the 10-lap Mini Stock Main Event. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sportsman fast-heat race, Rayburn started on the pole and led all the 
way, with Cran taking second.

VOLLEYBALL: SCOTT AYAKATUBBY USES ACUPUNCTURE AS PART OF HIS TRAINING REGIMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you don't think beach volleyball is a tough sport, you should see veteran 
pro Scott Ayakatubby during one of his acupuncture sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got needles sticking out of my ears, my hands, my back, my feet, and my 
butt," Ayakatubby said. "But I'm hooked on it. It helps get the new blood in 
and the old blood out." 
</P>
<P>
For the last couple of years Ayakatubby, 25, of Hermosa Beach, has been using 
acupuncture as part of his training regimen. 
</P>
<P>
You could say Ayakatubby's seven-year career is literally suspended on pins and 
needles. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Ayakatubby had half a season wiped out because of a herniated 
disk between the last two vertebrae in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
The disk brushed against Ayakatubby's sciatic nerve, sending intense pain along 
his right side from his back to his heel. The injury is similar to the one 
suffered a year ago by baseball slugger Dave Winfield and hockey star Mario 
Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time it's just stiff, but when it hurts it's a sharp pain," 
Ayakatubby said. "Sometimes I've got to watch how I get out of bed in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
Ayakatubby first hurt the back after a tournament in Hawaii in 1988. He was out 
for the rest of that season and part of the next, frustrating the plans he and 
longtime partner Brent Frohoff had for a surge into the game's highest circle. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Ayakatubby is doing whatever he can to make sure it doesn't happen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Barring surgery, that has meant frequent visits to the chiropractor and 
masseuse and the acupuncturist, on recommendation from Ayakatubby's 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as scared of needles as anyone else, but I figured if my grandmother could 
handle it, I could too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Ayakatubby appears to be all the way back. This weekend in Cape 
Cod, Mass., he's playing with his fourth partner of the year -- first Frohoff, 
then veterans John Hanley, Jon Stevenson and Tim Hovland. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cape Cod Open, Ayakatubby is teamed with Hovland, the fifth-ranked 
player on the tour. Hovland's regular partner, Mike Dodd, missed the event with 
the flu. Ayakatubby and Hovland are the fourth-seeded team in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, Ayakatubby and Frohoff broke onto the tour. They were best 
buddies from Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ayakatubby was only a year removed from Mira Costa High -- he was Mustang Coach 
Mike Cook's most valuable player -- when he and Frohoff turned pro. 
</P>
<P>
They both had American Indian blood -- Ayakatubby is part-Chickasaw, and 
Frohoff is part-Cherokee. The rest of the tour called them "The Young Lions." 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great summer that year," Ayakatubby said. "All of a sudden, we had 
all this money we never had before, and we were just having a good time, on and 
off the beach." 
</P>
<P>
As the years went by, the pair began to take volleyball seriously. They made it 
a way of life. They won their first tournament in 1985 at Santa Cruz; a year 
later they won the second indoor championship of beach volleyball at the 
Calgary Saddledome. 
</P>
<P>
But they split for good this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ayakatubby and Frohoff beat Hovland and Dodd on April 29 to win at Ft. Worth, 
Tex. In other tournaments, they finished second twice, and fourth once. 
</P>
<P>
But Frohoff moved on in late May, when former Olympian Karch Kiraly dumped his 
partner, Kent Steffes of Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Kiraly had experimented with Frohoff as a partner last season during 
Ayakatubby's injury problems. Now Kiraly-Frohoff is one of the tour's most 
formidable tandems, finishing no less than second in four events. 
</P>
<P>
"Brent's game has really grown by playing with Karch," Ayakatubby said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ayakatubby holds no hope of playing with his old friend again, he 
isn't holding grudges either. 
</P>
<P>
"When Brent went with Karch, it was a pure business decision," Ayakatubby said. 
"He had a chance to play with one of the best players in the world. I'd 
probably do the same thing. It happens. I just can't dwell on it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Ayakatubby is toughing it out. He and Stevenson -- the Assn. of 
Volleyball Professionals president -- took seventh at Indianapolis last 
weekend, which brought Ayakatubby's earnings this season to $31,000. He has 
made more than $130,000 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
At times, he's done it while battling heat exhaustion, which makes his legs 
lock up and shake uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
"I walk around like I'm 90 years old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then of course there's the stiff back, which constantly reminds Ayakatubby of 
the delicacy of his career. 
</P>
<P>
The inherent demands of beach competition -- twisting, turning, jumping, 
arching the back for spikes and diving into the sand for digs -- takes a steady 
toll on the 6-foot-4 Ayakatubby. 
</P>
<P>
"This game wrecks my body more than any other sport," he said. "It's kind of 
frustrating because this is how I make my living." 
</P>
<P>
He's no longer a young lion. Nowadays, folks around the tour call him "Ak." 
Ayakatubby has the beach in his blood -- he started playing beach volleyball at 
6, helped along by his mother and his uncle, Matt Gage. 
</P>
<P>
Gage, the AVP's tour director, was an active player during Ayakatubby's boyhood 
and won 26 open tournaments "back when they played for a six-pack and a 
T-shirt," Ayakatubby said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Ayakatubby is happy. He has finally reached a plateau where he can work 
out during the week, and he's playing consistently again. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to stay healthy so I can go all out, which I haven't been able to do 
for two years," he said. "I hated sitting out. That puts you into a bad mood 
all the time."

KRUSEMAN WINS THREE-QUARTER MIDGET MAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cory Kruseman, 19, of Ventura won the three-quarter Midget 20-lap USAC Western 
States Series main event at Ventura Raceway on Saturday night before 2,380. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Gibb of Long Beach held a narrow lead over Kruseman for 16 laps before 
spinning out in Turn 4. 
</P>
<P>
Kruseman took the lead, but was locked in a tight battle with Page Jones of 
Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Jones edged past Kruseman on Lap 18. But Jones, with Kruseman on his tail, hit 
a groove and slid sideways on Lap 19, giving Kruseman the space he needed to go 
on to win. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Drake of Valencia finished second and Rob Hansen of Simi Valley third. 
Jones was fifth. Frank Pedregon of Gardena led wire-to-wire to win the Midget 
30-lap main event. Hank Butcher of San Leandro edged George Ito of Ventura to 
finish second. 
</P>
<P>
City of Industry's Robby Flock and Anaheim's Gary Howard each won a 10-lap 
Midget heat race. The eight-lap heat race winners for three-quarter Midgets 
were Jim Styer of Tujunga, Steve Kellick of Ventura, Ito, and Tom Morley of 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Deiny Jr. of Burbank won the flip-plagued three-quarter Midget 10-lap 
semi-main event to lead a four-car contingent transferring to the main event 
from a 19-car starting field. 
</P>
<P>
Also making the transfer were Gibb, Gary Schroeder of Burbank, and Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Fast one-lap qualifying times were set by Flock in the Midgets at 13.156 
seconds and Drake in the three-quarter Midgets at 14.144.

FAST FINISHES CARRY ARRUE TO 3 CYCLING WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Van Nuys cyclist Marcello Arrue has been keeping his backers -- and opponents 
-- in suspense to the finish with his come-from-behind style of racing. 
</P>
<P>
Arrue's furious finishing sprint helped him to three wins Saturday night at the 
Encino Velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening event, Arrue, who races for the Montrose team, held off Santa 
Barbara's Chris Johnson of the Diamond Back team in the final stretch to take 
the senior men's Division I-II miss-and-out. 
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour later in the three-lap sprint final, Johnson opened about a 
15-meter gap over Arrue with 1 1/2 laps remaining but Arrue, pedaling 
frantically in the outside lane with 50 meters to go, slipped past Johnson to 
win his second race by half a wheel. 
</P>
<P>
Arrue's sprint was still strong in the 10-lap scratch final as he swooped past 
Kevin Peck of Subaru/Montgomery for his third win. Earlier, Arrue had come from 
behind to win his sprint heat over Agoura Hills' Peter Sullivan of Conejo Velo, 
taking the qualifying race in the final 200 meters. Johnson and Peck won the 
other two sprint heats. 
</P>
<P>
Fatigue later plagued Arrue, however, as he faded to fifth -- and last -- in 
the 25-lap points race won by Peck (21 points). 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley Velo's Michelle Lehnhoff, a Lancaster resident, held off 
CeloPacific's Meg Berry, 36, of Vista, in the final stretch to win the women's 
scratch race.

CANYON'S BIALAS PASSES FIRST TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterback Kevin Bialas overcame a shaky start Saturday to lead Canyon High to 
a 21-7 victory over Notre Dame in the second round of the L.A. Games football 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Bialas, making his debut at quarterback, threw an interception on his first 
pass, but he settled down and threw two touchdown strikes to receiver Jim 
Zopelis to lead the Cowboys to the win at North Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which had a bye in the first round, will meet North Torrance, the 
defending L.A. Games champion, this morning at 8:30 at North Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance defeated Chatsworth, 13-6, and Verbum Dei, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, sparked by interceptions by Joe McKeon and Rob Lantiser, broke a 7-7 
tie with two second-half scores. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with the defense and the way our offense came back and played 
after the bad start," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Alemany 3, San Fernando 2 -- Pinch-runner Brian Cooney scored on Brian Shaw's 
single in the sixth inning, carrying across what proved to be the decisive run 
for visiting Alemany in a game called after six innings because of a time 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando's Canto Franco scattered eight hits and struck out nine. 
</P>
<P>

THE CELLULAR TELEPHONE INDUSTRY PROVIDES SERVICE AT PRICES THE MARKET IS 
WILLING TO BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The comments made by Los Angeles Assemblywoman Gwen Moore in "Cellular 
Telephone Blues" (June 10) may be well intended, but she seems to be either 
mis- or uninformed. 
</P>
<P>
Cellular telephone service is anything but a fixed-cost business. 
</P>
<P>
For every subscriber added to a cellular system, additional radios in each 
cell, more telephone lines (for which operators pay a hefty fee to Pacific 
Bell), more microwave equipment to link the cells to the central computer and 
ultimately more cells (each at about $1 million) are required. And with the 
increasing shift toward portable phones, there must be an investment in even 
more cells with no reciprocal increase in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Cellular service is a premium product. There are a variety of cheaper mobile 
communications alternatives; those who subscribe to cellular service do so out 
of choice. Since when are we in the business of regulating what the market will 
bear for a premium product? Should we regulate the price of a new Mercedes 
simply because it has access to the public roads? 
</P>
<P>
Let's also not forget that the street price of a cellular phone has dropped 
from about $3,500 just six years ago to about $350 today. Would that have ever 
happened in a regulated environment? And how many more people can now afford 
this service as a result?

ICN CHALLENGES 'CONTROVERSIAL' DRUG DESCRIPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We would like to point out that the antiviral drug ribavirin is not in itself 
"controversial" (as stated in Gregory Crouch's June 16, 1990, story, "Ireland 
Approves ICN's Ribavirin for Treating HIV"). 
</P>
<P>
At present, ribavirin is authorized for a variety of viral infections in over 
30 countries throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of ribavirin in the United 
States in late 1985 for the aerosolized treatment of infants and young children 
hospitalized with severe respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV), and since that time over 65,000 babies in the United 
States have been treated with ribavirin for RSV infection. In addition, 16 
other countries outside the United States, including seven European countries, 
have authorized ribavirin for use in the treatment of RSV. 
</P>
<P>
For well over a decade, ribavirin has been used by some five million patients 
throughout the world, without significant adverse experience. Other indications 
for which ribavirin is authorized in countries outside the United States 
include herpes simplex virus, influenza, hepatitis and measles and chickenpox. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has worked extensively with ribavirin in evaluating its efficacy 
against viruses. The Army's most advanced work with ribavirin has been in 
testing it against the hemorrhagic fevers. An Army study conducted in 1988 in 
China in conjunction with the Hubei Medical College in Wuhan, China, along with 
a Centers for Disease Control study with ribavirin against Lassa Fever in 
Sierre Leone, will form the basis of a new drug application the Army plans to 
submit to the FDA for marketing authorization for hemorrhagic fever with renal 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Ribavirin, synthesized in 1970, is scientifically well documented. Over 700 
scientific papers have been published in its support. Over 5,400 patients have 
participated in 139 controlled and non-controlled clinical trials with 
ribavirin. 
</P>
<P>
What the Times should have said in its June 16 article is that ribavirin was 
the subject of two clinical trials in 1986 that some considered controversial 
-- not that the drug itself is controversial. Surely, for example, to U.S. 
infants hospitalized with RSV, patients outside the U.S. hospitalized for 
severe cases of measles and to patients afflicted with hemorrhagic fevers in 
African nations, ribavirin is hardly controversial.

ALICE KAHN: IT'S ALL A KROC: YOU STILL CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you're back near home-sweet-home Chicago for an Elvis Presley 
impersonators' convention but stuck at an airport hotel without a car, what do 
you do? 
</P>
<P>
You walk out a little and reach the kind of neighborhood you thought had 
stopped existing when you left the Midwest in 1961 and vowed: I'll never live 
in this boring place again. 
</P>
<P>
Only now, it looks beautiful to you. Every detail seems precious. The neat 
lawns. The picket fences. The polite children lined up for the school bus. The 
proud little hand-carved mailbox in front of the clean brick bungalow that 
reads, "The Home of Fred Fredrickson." 
</P>
<P>
The thick air, the catalpa trees, the subtle smells seem so oddly familiar. The 
lush summer greenery feels like a hothouse to you after spending the past 25 
years in dry, dry California. You ask yourself why you ever left. 
</P>
<P>
You must see more of this place that you once called home. So, you look in the 
front of the phone book for nearby sights to see. Nuts! The Leaning Tower of 
Pisa YMCA is too far away. But you're in luck -- the McDonald's Museum is just 
three miles down the road. 
</P>
<P>
It would be no fun alone, so you pick up some fellow conventioneers. In this 
case, you seek out two state-of-the-art New Yorkers who caught your eye -- 
Kerry and Claire. He: a Manhattan PR man by day and a country singer by night. 
She: a director at a leading ad agency by day and, by night, a Jell-O mold 
artist and a singer with the group the Earnest Borgnines. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry is at the convention trying to sell his song "Back From the Dead and 
Ready to Rock." Claire is there taping and "shooting" -- photographing -- 
things. 
</P>
<P>
You have noticed them because they are the kind of people who would stand out 
anywhere -- by virtue of their clever comments and their sharp clothes. Claire 
tells you about the time her agency lost the Oreos account and the boss said, 
"Let's not hang on the cross if we're going down the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
Kerry is wearing a bright yellow tuxedo adorned with drawings of records 
bearing the names of Elvis' greatest hits. His mother sewed it for him from 
material he purchased at Jimmy Velvet's Elvis Museum in Miami. Claire wears a 
'70s polyester mini dress and black platform boots with fishnet stockings. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Kerry and Claire want to go to the McDonald's Museum, which is 
housed in the original, primal Des Plaines, Ill., McDonald's. The Midwest is 
like a David Lynch movie to them. 
</P>
<P>
We take a taxi and find everything at McDonald's frozen as it was on opening 
day -- April 15, 1955. In the parking lot, under the neon golden arch, is 
Speedee, the smiley-faced, running hamburger, wearing a chef's hat and holding 
up a sign reading "15 cents." 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere a sound system plays "Rock Around the Clock." Claire shoots Kerry 
leaning against a '55 Olds Super 88. There is also a yellow Chrysler St. Regis 
with a dashboard Madonna (the original Madonna), a Chevy Bel Air with a 
coonskin cap in the back seat and a Ford Fairlane with the April 15, 1955, 
Chicago Tribune on the front seat. The headline reads, "Stratton Asks Polio 
Aid." 
</P>
<P>
Kerry was a year old when this happened. Claire wasn't born. I was 11, and I 
find myself feeling oddly close to tears. It was all once actually real to me. 
And again I ask myself: What was I running away from here? 
</P>
<P>
I slowly rub my hand along the achingly clean red-and-white tile structure. 
Whoever imagined that a preserved McDonald's would someday seem beautiful and 
quaint? 
</P>
<P>
We enter the building and are greeted by Lorraine Peterson and Virginia Cooper, 
two senior citizens employed as docents. "Oh, get a shot of this," says Kerry. 
Claire shoots him next to the potato peeler, touching the DO NOT TOUCH sign. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine points out that we are in the "first Ray Kroc franchised McDonald's," 
not the first McDonald's drive-in. That one is in San Bernardino, Calif., and 
it was there that Kroc, a Multimixer salesman, went on a trip, liked what he 
saw and decided that we needed another 11,162 of them. 
</P>
<P>
We follow a class of international graduates from Hamburger University into the 
drive-in's basement, which is loaded with early photographs and Krocobilia. 
Claire shoots Kerry with the Hamburger U grads, with the museum janitor and 
next to the sign telling employees how to scrub the machines with Bab-o. You 
just know all this is going to be terribly amusing to Claire's friends in the 
Manhattan ad world. Every bit of Middle America is a collectible to people who 
live in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Moved as I am by this monument to innocence, nevertheless I ask Lorraine, "I 
hope this doesn't offend you, but can you recommend a good place to eat around 
here?" 
</P>
<P>
That is how we ended up at the Sugar Bowl, in downtown Des Plaines since 1921, 
with long-forgotten foods at low prices. As Kerry climbs on a counter stool to 
photograph my egg salad sandwich and lime rickey, three white-haired ladies in 
the booth next to ours, their snap-on shades in the flaps-up position, gaze 
sternly our way. We are laughing. We look different. We are not sitting in our 
place. Clearly, they disapprove. I start to recollect why I left. 
</P>
<P>
As we walk back to the hotel, I realize sadly that I just love being with Kerry 
and Claire on this perfect, hot, lush, green Midwestern afternoon. We start 
harmonizing to "I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine." 
</P>
<P>
It happens all the time. You have a one-day life with people and never see them 
again. And sometimes you're born, raised and live in a place for 18 years and 
will never belong there again.

GUN CONTROL ARGUMENTS AIM AT TARGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Mott's excellent piece on firearms accidents raises the question of who 
is to blame for the steadily increasing death toll from unintended shootings. 
He covered most of the obvious causes -- parental carelessness, shooter 
inexperience, and disregard for safety. 
</P>
<P>
But he missed an important possibility, and it was right in front of him on the 
Calendar pages: the heavy emphasis on gunplay in today's movies. 
</P>
<P>
Take this issue (June 15): 
</P>
<P>
On Page 2, Mel Gibson embraces Goldie Hawn and a Baretta 9-millimeter automatic 
under critics' rave reviews for the "hot action and wild humor" in "Bird on a 
Wire." 
</P>
<P>
On Page 3, Nick Nolte takes a two-handed grip on some kind of revolver aimed 
over the reader's right shoulder, while Eddie Murphy grins at the victim's 
plight in "Another 48 Hours." 
</P>
<P>
Page 8 shows this summer's hero, Dick Tracy, blazing away with an antique 
.45-caliber Thompson submachine gun. Pure spoof, but with a deadly message. 
Credit Americans with putting gun and play together into one word. 
</P>
<P>
Then turn to Page 11 and find Tim Robbins with his finger on the trigger of an 
AK-47 poised over Robin Williams' ear, while a string of reviewers' 
endorsements for "Cadillac Man" reveal that this flick is actually a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Guns are no laughing matter, as Mott's story makes plain. 
</P>
<P>
When the movie industry exploits violence with firearms as mere comic relief it 
gains a share of responsibility for needless gun deaths. As does The Times for 
spreading their foolish message.

ERMA BOMBECK: IN AGE OF SUPER-BRATS -- TENNIS, ANYONE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1905, May Sutton, the first non-English Wimbledon champion, caused a flap 
when she rolled up her shirt sleeves on the court because she was "too hot." 
The corset and the petticoats she was wearing probably had a lot to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Billie Tapscott played Wimbledon without stockings. Get 
outta here! From there on, the dress code got out of control. Alice Marble wore 
short tennis shorts, Gussie Moran revealed lace-edged panties, and Billie Jean 
King, in her famous match against Bobby Riggs in 1973, wore a mint-green tennis 
dress with sky-blue collar decorated with a band of rhinestones and green 
sequins. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis court apparel was destined to change. Andre Agassi, from Las Vegas, came 
head to head with the French Tennis Federation because he is a forerunner of 
the hot lava Spandex Age. When he appeared on the court recently dressed in 
glowing pink and black shirt, black denim shorts, pink cycling tights 
underneath and matching shoes and headband, the federation screamed "ban" and 
suggested a dress code for tennis players to be adopted by the United States 
and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
When our young son was 8 years old, I entered him in a local tennis tournament 
because it would keep him busy for an hour while I went to the supermarket. The 
fact that he had never played a tennis game in his entire life was irrelevant. 
He drove me nuts at the store. 
</P>
<P>
His court attire was plaid shorts down to his knees, a pair of black high-tops 
and a sweat shirt. His opponent was in white, had a headband and ("We are in 
deep trouble, kid!") a sweatband on his wrist. He probably squeezed a tennis 
ball in his sleep to strengthen his forearm. He had to tell my son where to 
stand to serve and when to change sides. I couldn't watch. 
</P>
<P>
When I returned from the store, my son was sitting on the curb with a new can 
of tennis balls. His opponent told him he had won. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to get excited over what tennis players choose to wear on court. Good 
tennis is good tennis no matter how you dress it. What we should be getting 
excited about are the lack of manners and the foul language. It is not 
tolerated in any other sports event. Yet these super-brats are allowed to throw 
rackets, challenge decisions with profanities and make obscene gestures to the 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
They can glow in the dark if they want to. Just knock it off with the theatrics 
and play tennis!

OK, KIDS, HERE'S SOME FUN FOR YOU; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVITIES: SCHOOL'S OUT, PARENTS, BUT DON'T PANIC: THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO 
KEEP YOUR CHILDREN FROM TURNING INTO VEGETABLES OVER THE SUMMER. 
</P>

<P>
Summer's here, and what's a kid to do? Well, on the Westside he or she can 
learn the hula, take up golf, build a 30-foot banana split or even get a job. 
</P>
<P>
The next three months needn't just be spent in front of the television, at the 
movies or the mall or in lines at amusement parks. City recreation departments, 
libraries, schools and nonprofit organizations are ready with free and low-cost 
answers to the "What's there to do?" wail of restless kids. 
</P>
<P>
Day camps still have openings, directors say, probably because many parents 
haven't been fully hit with the reality that school is out. They will likely 
"be filled (this) week when kids are out of school, and parents are saying, 'Oh 
my god, what am I going to do?' " said Elliot Heffler, recreation supervisor 
for the Culver City Department of Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
The day camps needn't be pricey. For $25, for instance, children can join the 
10-week day camp at Culver Slauson Park, operated by the city of Los Angeles. 
They'll be kept busy with crafts, movies, swimming and field trips and get a 
yellow T-shirt imprinted with a bear frolicking in a stream, recreation 
director Michael Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's (about) $2 a week to drop their kid here. . . . It's a bargain," Davidson 
said, adding that there are plenty of openings. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't get into a day camp, there are drop-in programs at several public 
parks. "There's arts and crafts, a person there to supervise the kids, 
equipment there to play with, so you don't feel your child is there totally 
alone," said Nicole Vogel, volunteer coordinator for the Beverly Hills 
Recreation and Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's recreation department will offer trips, games and cake-eating, 
punch-guzzling, and "just a variety of wacky contests" at several elementary 
schools and parks, recreation program coordinator Teri Akloff said. Each week's 
activities will revolve around a theme, such as "Circus, Circus," "Hit the 
Beat" (music-oriented), and "Stars and Stripes." 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood does not have supervised daytime drop-in programs, but it will 
give parents a reprieve on Parents Night Out, Aug. 18-19. They can leave their 
children 6 to 12 at Plummer Park and pick them up the next morning. The 
youngsters will be entertained with games and food. 
</P>
<P>
Several programs are tailored to teen-agers. "Club TC," formerly called the 
Teen Center, hopes to attract more clientele when it opens with a new look and 
feel on Thursday in Culver City's Veterans Memorial Park. The walls had been 
painted with a "goofy-looking" palm tree and purple flamingo, youth programs 
coordinator Pam Goodwin says. "Kids complained, 'It looks like a day-care 
center,' . . . (and) they were a little embarrassed" to hang out there, she 
said. The walls were recently repainted light gray with mauve, and black vinyl 
furniture and a revamped stereo system "(give ) it kind of a '90s look," 
Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The club is equipped with pool tables, video games, and air hockey and offers 
arts and crafts activities, all free of charge. Officially, it is limited to 
Culver City residents, but "if we're not jampacked . . . and if a kid comes in 
from L.A., I'm not going to say, 'You can't come in,' " Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, there are special events aimed to entice even the coolest of 
teen-agers -- such as the Limousine Scavenger Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"Six teens pile into a limo and search for things around the city" such as a 
scrap of a tire or an old newspaper," Goodwin said. The first team to return 
wins a prize. The hunt is planned for July 27 and will cost $7 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Youths can also help build and partake of a 30-foot banana split July 19. Last 
year, the monstrous dessert, dished up in plastic rain gutters, took about half 
an hour to build and 10 minutes to devour, Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Teen beach devotees can congregate at Santa Monica Beach tower No. 26 for 
volleyball, frisbee and music, starting this week, from Tuesday through Friday, 
11-4 p.m. Teen-age basketball, volleyball and Ping-Pong players can use the 
gyms at Lincoln and John Adams middle schools in Santa Monica on Monday through 
Thursday, 4-9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
If the family summer plans don't include a trip to the South Pacific, your 
child can stay in Westchester and at least learn to move as the Polynesians do. 
Hawaiian and Polynesian dances, including the hula and others that tell stories 
with hand movements, are offered at the Westchester Recreation Center. The 
center also has sign language and jujitsu martial arts classes. 
</P>
<P>
For the die-hard thespian/director/producer crowd, Beverly Hills has a 
Children's Theatre Workshop at Roxbury Park. Children from 8 to 13 delve into 
improvisation, characterization, costuming, makeup, set design and other 
aspects of theater production. They produce two shows, in the middle and at the 
end of the eight-week program. Often, the plays are written by the children 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Would-be golfers can learn to swing in a free clinic from Tuesday through 
Thursday at Rancho Park Golf Course. Culver Slauson Park has a co-ed Sports 
Camp, which starts with basic skills and graduates to the sports themselves. 
Included are soccer, basketball, slow-pitch softball, and track and field. 
</P>
<P>
Several cities provide swimming lessons for children at local pools. Students 
can learn diving, water polo and lifeguarding skills. Pools at many 
neighborhood schools are also open to the public during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
And if you can't get to the pool, the pool will come to you. The Los Angeles 
Unified School District's Portable Pool travels to four Westside schools in 
July and August, where elementary school-age children can take lessons in water 
safety and swimming. 
</P>
<P>
To get in touch with nature, the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom in 
Beverly Hills leads walks every week in Franklin Canyon. For infants and 
toddlers -- and their parents -- there are "Babes in the Woods" and "Tykes on 
Hikes" programs, which go at a pace of about a mile an hour. "A lot of 
stopping, looking, observing," program coordinator Steven Saffier said of the 
hikes. "Kids are encouraged to explore nature, using all their senses -- except 
taste." 
</P>
<P>
Children can learn how the Chumash Indians built their dwellings, wikiups, in a 
session offered by the Wilderness Institute in the Santa Monica Mountains. The 
organization also plans to spend "An Evening With the Owls" and another evening 
doing "Family Storytelling Under the Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
So that children's minds don't vegetate too much, libraries offer reading 
programs and storytelling. In "Reading Round-Up in the Wild, Wild West" at the 
Santa Monica main library, for instance, children get a certificate decorated 
with prairie dogs on which they record the books they've read. When they've 
read 10, the librarians will take a instant picture of them and their favorite 
books and post their names on a library bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica College, Culver City Adult School and Los Angeles Unified School 
District's community adult schools -- despite their names -- also have classes 
for youths. Los Angeles high school students can even take driver's education 
on television. The classes will be broadcast daily on the district's television 
station, KLCS-TV Channel 58. Students have to come to school, however, to turn 
in homework and take tests. 
</P>
<P>
Youths can also volunteer for their local good cause. Heal the Bay, for one, 
has teen-agers help in the office and on special events. Hospitals often need 
teens who are interested in the health professions. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's always the good old summer job. They're going fast, but some jobs 
at government agencies and nonprofit organizations are still available through 
the federal Summer Youth Employment and Training Program. The jobs, which pay 
minimum wage, $4.25 an hour, include computer operation, street maintenance and 
day-camp counseling positions. Teen-agers can apply at any California 
Employment Development Department office. 
</P>
<P>
There are also openings through First Break, sponsored by the Los Angeles 
school district and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. High school students 
are given lists of employers and tips on how to land and keep a job, school 
district spokeswoman Tammy Sims said. The project is still seeking employers, 
she added.

WRITE-IN BID THREATENED IN 52ND DISTRICT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The disgruntled runner-up in the 52nd Assembly District Republican primary is 
threatening to wage a write-in campaign in November, buoying the hopes of the 
underdog Democratic nominee and raising the specter of a divided Republican 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Manning, who lost by 72 votes in the final primary count, said he is 
considering a write-in campaign because the Republican winner, Diamond Bar 
Councilman Paul V. Horcher, is not conservative enough to satisfy voters in the 
predominantly GOP district. 
</P>
<P>
He also accused Horcher of running a dirty campaign. Horcher denied that charge 
and said his political views are nearly as conservative as Manning's. 
</P>
<P>
The chief beneficiary of a write-in effort could be Democratic nominee Gary 
Neely, a 40-year-old marketing consultant from Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Neely, who labels himself a conservative Democrat, said his candidacy is 
picking up support from Republican voters dissatisfied with the primary outcome 
for the vacant Assembly seat. In an unusually fractured eight-candidate race, 
Horcher won the primary with slightly less than 18% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Neely said he thinks he has a chance to upset Horcher whether or not Manning 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Neely and Horcher, a 38-year-old attorney, are stressing their conservative 
credentials. Manning disagrees. "From my perspective, we have two candidates 
who are moderates. The conservatives don't have anybody to vote for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he runs, Manning will be the only anti-abortion candidate. Neely and Horcher 
favor abortion rights, although Horcher is opposed to government funding of 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, who lives in Hacienda Heights, said he will decide on a write-in 
campaign in the next few weeks. He says he would have plenty of support from 
local Republicans but is not sure he could raise enough money -- $100,000 or 
more, by his estimation -- to run a successful campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said he also may ask for a recount. The county registrar-recorder last 
week reported a final but still unofficial count that showed Horcher defeating 
Manning by 72 votes, 5,041 to 4,969. The county will certify the results 
Tuesday, and Manning will have until July 2 to ask for a recount at his own 
expense, with the cost refunded if the result is changed in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial returns on election night had Horcher 64 votes ahead of Wil 
Baca, a Hacienda Heights environmentalist, and 166 ahead of Manning. In the 
final unofficial tally, Manning surged past Baca, who wound up third with 4,956 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said he doubts that Manning, 37, a construction contractor and member 
of the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District board, will carry out his 
threat to run as a write-in candidate. Such a campaign would be futile and 
would damage Manning's standing in the Republican Party, Horcher said. "It 
would create more difficulties for him (than me)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher pointed out that Manning in April had signed a fair campaign pledge 
that included this statement: "I will support the Republican nominee after the 
primary election." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a solemn oath," Horcher said. 
</P>
<P>
But Manning said his promise is not binding because most of the other 
candidates, including Horcher, refused to sign the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said Manning will be making a mistake if he undertakes a write-in 
campaign. "I think supporting the party is more important than playing a 
spoiled brat," he said. During the campaign, Baca said, Manning stressed his 
loyalty to the party and his long service to the Republican cause. It is odd, 
Baca said, for a candidate who "claimed he was a Republican since he was in 
diapers to be putting his own ambitions before the interests of the party." 
</P>
<P>
Neely ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and tallied 18,010 votes, almost 
13,000 more than Horcher in the splintered GOP race. 
</P>
<P>
But the 52nd Assembly District, which stretches from La Mirada and Whittier to 
the San Gabriel Valley, taking in Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, Walnut, 
Diamond Bar and part of West Covina, is decidedly Republican. There are 74,029 
registered Republicans, 65,722 Democrats and 15,450 who are unaffiliated or 
belong to minor parties. 
</P>
<P>
If he does not undertake a write-in campaign, Manning said, he believes that 
some of his supporters will vote Democratic. He said Neely is "as conservative 
as Paul Horcher and he's a much more likeable guy." 
</P>
<P>
Manning added: "Paul Horcher is in trouble in this district. He has some real 
work to do to convince people that he has ethics." 
</P>
<P>
Manning attributed his primary loss to a smear campaign. He said Horcher 
unfairly attacked his record as a school trustee in mailers by distorting his 
school district's dropout rate. In addition, he said, someone ran a telephone 
campaign telling residents that Manning was the subject of a corruption 
investigation and had used drugs, both of which Manning denies. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said he did not run a telephone campaign smearing Manning and is not 
convinced that there was such a campaign. He said his mailers attacked 
Manning's record in office, using information from published reports. "I ran a 
hard campaign," he said. "I ran the campaign to win. I didn't do anything 
unethical or shady." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mautino, a Whittier attorney who finished sixth in the primary with 3,846 
votes, said he was repelled by Horcher's campaign. He said Horcher "was the 
only one who engaged in negative campaigning" and he is uncertain whether he 
will support him in November. "I'm hesitant to endorse a candidate who would 
use those tactics," Mautino said. 
</P>
<P>
But Baca said: "I didn't think it was a particularly dirty campaign. The hit 
pieces (Horcher) put out were what you would normally expect." 
</P>
<P>
Baca said he has not yet endorsed Horcher, but added, "I don't see any 
impediment to helping him as long as he recognizes the message that my campaign 
sent." 
</P>
<P>
Running as a moderate and an urban environmentalist, Baca promised to deal with 
traffic congestion, smog, water pollution and toxic waste. Baca said Horcher's 
victory and his own strong showing were a defeat for ultraconservatives. "If 
the Republican Party is going to be the majority party in California, it's 
going to have to move away from the right and toward the middle," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
But Horcher, whose primary campaign stressed his moderate stance -- in favor of 
abortion rights and sensitive to women's and minority issues -- said in a 
telephone interview last week: "I'm as conservative as Ken Manning." Later in 
the interview, he modified that to say that his political views were somewhere 
between Baca's and Manning's but probably closer to Manning's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a liberal Republican," he emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said his Assembly votes probably would not differ much from those of 
conservative Whittier Republican Frank Hill, who gave up the Assembly seat 
after winning election to the state Senate earlier this year. Hill endorsed 
Horcher a week before the election.

WHAT TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN? HOW ABOUT CAMP, OR . . .

<P>
School is out, which means many parents are looking for ways to keep children 
busy during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
There still is time to register for day camps throughout the San Gabriel 
Valley. Most of the summer programs begin on Monday and end Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
All of the YMCA branches in the region will offer day-camp programs, said Jack 
Tillman, executive director of the Pasadena branch. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena YMCA will also sponsor summer basketball and a camp for teen-agers 
throughout July. The West San Gabriel Valley YMCA in Alhambra will feature 
field trips every Wednesday. The facility also has a heated pool, movies, arts 
and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to turn summer into something fun, instead of just providing day 
care," said Judy Larman, program director for the YMCA in West Covina. "We give 
swimming lessons for all ages, from 2 months to adult." 
</P>
<P>
The Covina YMCA still has three two-week day-camp sessions open. The daily 
activities will include arts, crafts, swimming, and trips to museums, beaches 
and Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
For youths on the wild side, the Eaton Canyon Nature Center, a wilderness park 
in Pasadena, will offer two one-week sessions of day camp starting in August. 
Children ages 9 to 11 will attend six-hour days of indoor and outdoor crafts 
involving nature walks, animal tracking, and creating magnifying boxes. The 
cost is $60 per week. 
</P>
<P>
The La Canada Youth House Community Center in La Canada Flintridge offers 
day-camp programs at the La Canada Elementary and Palm Crest Elementary 
schools. With the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the center will provide science classes 
for children ages 4 1/2 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Creepy Crawly Critters," and "Jumping Jitter Bugs" are two of the many weekly 
classes, said Barbara Corsino of the center. These classes begin July 2. 
</P>
<P>
Although some classes for 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds already are filled, there are 
still openings in geology, math and archeology classes.

City Manager Philip Hawkey, whose selection over two black finalists ignited 
opposition from the city's minority community in April, is trying to dampen 
those flames. 
</P>
<P>
In his first week on the job last week, the former Toledo, Ohio, city manager, 
who Monday replaced retiring 17-year City Manager Donald McIntyre: 
</P>
<P>
* Met with the Police Department's Citizens Advisory Group, a 13-member, 
predominantly minority committee. 
</P>
<P>
* Talked individually with city directors, including the three who voted 
against giving him the job. 
</P>
<P>
* Planned to attend services at the city's oldest black church, the First 
African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
* Scheduled appointments with the Northwest Task Force and the 
Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to get to know the community as a whole . . . even those who were 
concerned about my appointment," Hawkey said. "We do need to work together." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some who had opposed him appeared to be taking a wait-and-see 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball's in his court," said Isaac Richards, a black activist who spoke 
forcefully against Hawkey in an April 24 public hearing. "If he goes out of his 
way to atone for whatever past mistakes he made in Toledo, it will be difficult 
to harbor ideas against him." 
</P>
<P>
City Director Chris Holden, who voted against offering Hawkey the city 
manager's post, said the new city manager has shown "a willingness to want to 
make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to support him in this effort," said Holden, the city's only 
black director. But Holden cautioned, "You can meet with a lot of people, but 
the bottom line is performance." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the city's minority community will be watching Hawkey's performance on 
issues that have long been important to them. 
</P>
<P>
Months before Hawkey was named as a finalist, controversy erupted over the 
failure of the city to implement a five-year, $35-million improvement plan for 
Northwest Pasadena, the city's largest minority neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation, firing and demotion of several black city administrators also 
prompted allegations of racism and sexism. A $100,000 study released in May by 
the Los Angeles consulting firm PeopleWorks concluded that some city practices 
resulted in unfair treatment of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey, 43, was perceived by some as a poor choice to address such concerns 
because of his record during his four years in Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
Black activists there criticized him for allowing police officers to randomly 
stop black men on city streets as an anti-gang measure and for firing Bernard 
Pete Culp, the black commissioner of renewal operations, amid allegations of 
mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio Civil Rights Commission has since found probable cause that Culp was 
discriminated against because he was fired without the opportunity to take a 
demotion. The commission is negotiating with Toledo officials to resolve the 
issue, said Francis Smith, chief of administration for the commission in 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
In his first week in Pasadena, Hawkey adopted what he called "an immediate 
agenda" that includes many minority concerns. He said he plans to take action 
on human services, Northwest Pasadena, affirmative action and staff vacancies, 
including the high-level posts of assistant city manager and police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a recall campaign against Director John Crowley, who voted for 
Hawkey, continues, said attorney Joe Hopkins. Recall supporters expect City 
Atty. Victor Kaleta to finish reviewing petition forms this week, and will 
begin collecting signatures after that. 
</P>
<P>
And city directors, who split 4 to 3 in their vote for Hawkey, appear to be 
continuing that split. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's board meeting, Directors William Thomson and Kathryn Nack refused 
to approve Richards' appointment to the city's Resource Allocation Committee. 
Richards was nominated for the post by Director Rick Cole, one of those who 
opposed Hawkey's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Nack contended that Richards' comments about the Hawkey selection during the 
April 24 board meeting had "denoted violence" against the board members. 
Thomson said Richards called the board members racist. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape of that meeting showed an angry Richards saying the board's vote 
for Hawkey was motivated by racism. He also pledged to make Hawkey's life "as 
miserable as possible on a daily basis" should Hawkey accept the job. No 
threats of violence were made. 
</P>
<P>
Richards was appointed to the committee on a 4-2 vote.

LOSER IN ASSEMBLY PRIMARY CONSIDERS WRITE-IN BID; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: KENNETH MANNING LOST THE 52ND DISTRICT REPUBLICAN NOMINATION BY 72 
VOTES. HIS EFFORTS MAY HELP THE DEMOCRATIC UNDERDOG. 
</P>

<P>
The disgruntled runner-up in the 52nd Assembly District Republican primary is 
threatening to wage a write-in campaign in November, buoying the hopes of the 
underdog Democratic nominee and raising the specter of a divided Republican 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Manning, who lost by 72 votes in the final primary count, said he is 
considering a write-in campaign because the Republican winner, Diamond Bar 
Councilman Paul V. Horcher, is not conservative enough to satisfy voters in the 
predominantly GOP district. 
</P>
<P>
He also accused Horcher of running a dirty campaign. Horcher denied that charge 
and said his political views are nearly as conservative as Manning's. 
</P>
<P>
The chief beneficiary of a write-in effort could be Democratic nominee Gary 
Neely, a 40-year-old marketing consultant from Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Neely, who labels himself a conservative Democrat, said his candidacy is 
picking up support from Republican voters dissatisfied with the primary outcome 
for the vacant Assembly seat. In an unusually fractured eight-candidate race, 
Horcher won the primary with slightly less than 18% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Neely said he thinks he has a chance to upset Horcher whether or not Manning 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Neely and Horcher, a 38-year-old attorney, are stressing their conservative 
credentials. Manning disagrees. "From my perspective, we have two candidates 
who are moderates. The conservatives don't have anybody to vote for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he runs, Manning will be the only anti-abortion candidate. Neely and Horcher 
favor abortion rights, although Horcher is opposed to government funding of 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, who lives in Hacienda Heights, said he will decide on a write-in 
campaign in the next few weeks. He says he would have plenty of support from 
local Republicans but is not sure he could raise enough money -- $100,000 or 
more, by his estimation -- to run a successful campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said he also may ask for a recount. The county registrar-recorder last 
week reported a final but still unofficial count that showed Horcher defeating 
Manning by 72 votes, 5,041 to 4,969. 
</P>
<P>
The county will certify the results Tuesday, and Manning will have until July 2 
to ask for a recount at his own expense, with the cost refunded if the result 
is changed in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial returns on election night had Horcher 64 votes ahead of Wil 
Baca, a Hacienda Heights environmentalist, and 166 ahead of Manning. In the 
final unofficial tally, Manning surged past Baca, who wound up third with 4,956 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said he doubts that Manning, 37, a construction contractor and member 
of the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District board, will carry out his 
threat to run as a write-in candidate. Such a campaign would be futile and 
would damage Manning's standing in the Republican Party, Horcher said. "It 
would create more difficulties for him (than me)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher pointed out that Manning in April had signed a fair campaign pledge 
that included this statement: "I will support the Republican nominee after the 
primary election." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a solemn oath," Horcher said. 
</P>
<P>
But Manning said his promise is not binding because most of the other 
candidates, including Horcher, refused to sign the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said Manning will be making a mistake if he undertakes a write-in 
campaign. "I think supporting the party is more important than playing a 
spoiled brat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Baca said, Manning stressed his loyalty to the party and 
his long service to the Republican cause. It is odd, Baca said, for a candidate 
who "claimed he was a Republican since he was in diapers to be putting his own 
ambitions before the interests of the party." 
</P>
<P>
Neely ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and tallied 18,010 votes, almost 
13,000 more than Horcher in the splintered GOP race. 
</P>
<P>
But the 52nd Assembly District, which stretches from La Mirada and Whittier to 
the San Gabriel Valley, taking in Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, Walnut, 
Diamond Bar and part of West Covina, is decidedly Republican. There are 74,029 
registered Republicans, 65,722 Democrats and 15,450 who are unaffiliated or 
belong to minor parties. 
</P>
<P>
If he does not undertake a write-in campaign, Manning said, he believes that 
some of his supporters will vote Democratic. He said Neely is "as conservative 
as Paul Horcher and he's a much more likeable guy." 
</P>
<P>
Manning added: "Paul Horcher is in trouble in this district. He has some real 
work to do to convince people that he has ethics." 
</P>
<P>
Manning attributed his primary loss to a smear campaign. He said Horcher 
unfairly attacked his record as a school trustee in mailers by distorting his 
school district's dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, someone ran a telephone campaign telling residents that 
Manning was the subject of a corruption investigation and had used drugs, both 
of which Manning denies. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said he did not run a telephone campaign smearing Manning and is not 
convinced that there was such a campaign. He said his mailers attacked 
Manning's record in office, using information from published reports. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran a hard campaign," he said. "I ran the campaign to win. I didn't do 
anything unethical or shady." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mautino, a Whittier attorney who finished sixth in the primary with 3,846 
votes, said he was repelled by Horcher's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He said Horcher "was the only one who engaged in negative campaigning" and he 
is uncertain whether he will support him in November. "I'm hesitant to endorse 
a candidate who would use those tactics," Mautino said. 
</P>
<P>
But Baca said: "I didn't think it was a particularly dirty campaign. The hit 
pieces (Horcher) put out were what you would normally expect." 
</P>
<P>
Baca said he has not endorsed Horcher, but added, "I don't see any impediment 
to helping him as long as he recognizes the message that my campaign sent." 
</P>
<P>
Running as a moderate and an urban environmentalist, Baca promised to deal with 
traffic congestion, smog, water pollution and toxic waste. Baca said Horcher's 
victory and his own strong showing were a defeat for ultraconservatives. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Republican Party is going to be the majority party in California, it's 
going to have to move away from the right and toward the middle," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
But Horcher, whose primary campaign stressed his moderate stance -- in favor of 
abortion rights and sensitive to women's and minority's issues -- said in a 
telephone interview last week: "I'm as conservative as Ken Manning." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the interview, he modified that to say that his political views were 
somewhere between Baca's and Manning's but probably closer to Manning's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a liberal Republican," he emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said his votes probably would not differ much from those of 
conservative Whittier Republican Frank Hill, who gave up the Assembly seat 
after winning election to the state Senate earlier this year. Hill endorsed 
Horcher a week before the election.

A TROUBLED 'HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS' 
</P>

<P>
George Bosy and his business partner took over a dilapidated motel on Mission 
Boulevard eight months ago and turned it into a haven for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
They named it the Four Aces Motel, refurbished some of the rooms, planted 
flowers and created a day-care center. They began offering two meals a day, 
plus a Sunday barbecue for anyone who wanted to drop by. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, they took in 20 homeless people who had been evicted from a 
makeshift camp at a lumberyard, putting some of them up in trailers on motel 
property. By last week, Four Aces was housing more than 80 men, women and 
children, most of whom otherwise would have been living on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy says Four Aces is just the start of what he envisions as a massive effort 
in Pomona to aid the homeless. He and his partner acquired 300 mobile homes, he 
said, and would like to scatter them in clusters throughout the city to provide 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Sound too good to be true? 
</P>
<P>
That's what some skeptics say, including Mayor Donna Smith, who has been 
clashing with Bosy ever since he began seeking the city's blessing for a 
project that appears to violate the Pomona's zoning regulations, does not 
follow the usual pattern of nonprofit shelters for the homeless and is run by a 
man who concedes that he acts like a jerk at council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy, 37, an engineer by training, said his angry outbursts, in which he 
usually accuses the mayor and city staff members of delaying his project, get 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a jerk, but at least something happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council last week voted 3 to 0 to instruct city staff members to work with 
Bosy to help his project become part of a comprehensive approach to the city's 
homeless problem. Smith, although she voted in favor of the measure, said she 
is concerned that Bosy and his partner may ultimately ask the city to subsidize 
the entire project. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy runs Four Aces for his partner, Mike Damico, who owns an auto wrecking 
yard and auto parts distribution business. 
</P>
<P>
Both say they are helping the homeless as a humanitarian gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lord's been good to me, and I'm trying to pass it on to someone else," 
Damico said. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy acknowledged that their acquisition of the motel coincided with a separate 
business venture, the purchase of the 300 old mobile homes. Bosy said they had 
planned to put the mobile homes on lots in the desert between Victorville and 
Barstow and sell them as low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
But as soon as they brought a few of the mobile homes onto their property to 
make repairs on them, homeless people started setting up housekeeping in the 
trailers, Bosy said. So their Pomona plan was launched. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 300 mobile homes available," Damico said. "The city has property all 
over. Why not get together and do something?" 
</P>
<P>
They have not requested any city funds but so far have been unable to win city 
support for such a bold undertaking. Bosy instead has suggested a pilot project 
that would put 10 mobile homes behind the motel and expand the homeless program 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Dwain Elliott, Pomona community relations coordinator, said that proposal has 
also run into problems over zoning and planning. The city attorney has 
suggested that the project might require an environmental impact report, 
revision of the city's zoning ordinance and extensive hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott said that, under city zoning regulations, Bosy cannot use his facility 
as both a motel and a business refurbishing mobile homes. In addition, if more 
than two mobile homes are on the property, it qualifies as a trailer park and 
must meet a host of regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy said it is unfair for the city to require him to meet standard mobile home 
park requirements when all he is trying to do is provide basic housing for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott said there is no doubt that Bosy is sheltering and feeding the homeless 
and that people are better off living there than on the street. But, he said, 
the city cannot abandon its regulations without incurring liability. However, 
the city has made no effort to prevent Bosy from housing the homeless and 
restoring trailers. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy said homeless residents pay whatever they can for the accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Several said they are grateful for the help they have been given. 
</P>
<P>
Cyndie Sackett, 30, who is expecting a baby in October, said she was traveling 
with a carnival show when she became ill and was stranded. She wound up at Four 
Aces after a brief stay at another shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"George is a good man; he's got his heart in the right place," she said. "He's 
doing all he can to take care of us."

FLAWED ARGUMENTS IN PARKLAND SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Siegfrid Othmer's answers in the Point/Counterpoint interview (Times, June 3), 
opposing the so-called land swap to obtain public ownership of 5,700 acres of 
superb parkland now owned by Bob Hope, are well argued. The only difficulty is 
that his arguments, which focus on blocking development of Jordan Ranch by the 
Hope interests, are based on seriously flawed premises. 
</P>
<P>
I find it curious that The Times chose a representative of the proposed 
developer of Jordan Ranch as the proponent of public acquisition of the 5,700 
acres, rather than a member of one of the well-established environmental 
organizations that support the acquisition, such as the Sierra Club, the Santa 
Monica Mountains Trails Council, the Rancho Simi Parks and Recreation District, 
Equestrian Trails Inc. It is not surprising, on the other hand, that Mr. Othmer 
represented the opposing position, since he is the spokesperson for the primary 
group opposing acquisition, an ad hoc group whose focus is almost exclusively 
on Jordan Ranch rather than on the broader picture. 
</P>
<P>
The flawed premises in Mr. Othmer's answers include the following: 
</P>
<P>
Flawed premise No. 1: Parks officials should act to restrict landowners' 
ability to develop property of park value that they are unable to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
It is a primary function of the National Park Service, the California State 
Parks Department, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and other public park 
agencies to acquire high-quality parkland. It is not their function to block 
development. If a representative of one of these agencies was to state that his 
aim was to block development, as Mr. Othmer favors, all hell would break loose, 
and he would soon be out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
Flawed premise No. 2: Since Palo Comado Canyon (where Jordan Ranch lies) is on 
the acquisition list of the National Park Service's Santa Monica National 
Recreation Area, Jordan Ranch should be given top priority for acquisition, by 
whatever means. 
</P>
<P>
There is much land of high quality in the national Park Service's Santa Monica 
Mountains zone. That's precisely why the National Recreation Area was 
established. Jordan Ranch rates inclusion, but not priority over all else. As a 
matter of fact, many of those who would like to see the SMMNRA fulfill its 
potential feel that more attention should be paid to acquisitions in the Santa 
Monica Mountains, with less emphasis on the Simi Hills, where Jordan Ranch is 
located. It is predominantly the Santa Monica Mountains for which the National 
Recreation Area was created. 
</P>
<P>
Flawed premise No. 3: The power of condemnation is a suitable and desirable 
means of acquiring Jordan Ranch from the Hope interests. 
</P>
<P>
Condemnation is out of the question. The idea was broached once before in a 
case of much less visibility, where the property owner was much less prominent 
and influential than Mr. Hope (the Murphy Dunn property on the high point of 
the ridge between Zuma and Trancas Canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains). That 
effort backfired drastically, bringing down the wrath of important politicians 
and setting back progress in the National Recreation Area. Furthermore, does 
Mr. Othmer really believe that the Hope interests would be willing to enter 
negotiations for Corral Canyon, China Flat and Runkle Ranch with condemnation 
proceedings on Jordan Ranch threatened? Ridiculous! 
</P>
<P>
Flawed premise No. 4: Trying to decide what is high-quality parkland and what 
is of lesser quality is a "muddy area we have no business touching." 
</P>
<P>
The matter of deciding on priorities is what this discussion is all about. I 
have no difficulty whatever in deciding that the 59 acres, now in National Park 
ownership, to be given up for the 5,700 acres, is of no great concern. The 59 
acres in contention is completely outside the Cheeseboro Canyon watershed (not 
"in Cheeseboro Canyon" as stated in the Times "background" material), and would 
never have been missed if those acres had not been included in the Cheeseboro 
acquisition. They are included purely by accident of property boundary lines. 
</P>
<P>
It is precisely the lucky accident that those 59 acres were acquired, in what 
turned out to provide a viable access to Jordan Ranch, that makes them the key 
that, if all goes well, will unlock the acquisition of 5,700 acres of wonderful 
parkland, to the great benefit of us all.

A state Senate panel has approved a bill that would exempt Los Angeles County 
from a law aimed at controlling growth around California's airports. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) cleared the Senate 
Committee on Local Government last week on a 6-2 vote, backed by cities 
concerned that the law will diminish their planning powers. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a 5-month-old law designed to bridle growth near airports in the 
interests of air safety and minimizing the exposure of homes and businesses to 
aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
The law, written by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), requires that 
comprehensive airport land-use plans be drafted by June 30, 1991; Los Angeles 
County, however, recently won an extension to Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The law, as now written, could affect new development near airports in Los 
Angeles, Long Beach, Compton, Torrance, Hawthorne, El Monte, Santa Monica, La 
Verne, Burbank and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Without the exemption Beverly seeks, the law would enable Los Angeles County 
community groups to use the courts to stop growth within a mile of an airport's 
runways if the area is not covered by an airport land-use plan by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The law seeks to give -- through the threat of resident lawsuits that would 
come after the deadline -- teeth to a state requirement for land-use planning 
around airports. The requirement has been in effect for 20 years, but there are 
land-use plans for only half of the 269 airports in the state. Land-use plans 
have not been completed for any of the 17 airports in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel (Los Angeles County) is really abrogating its responsibility to come up 
with a plan," Bergeson, chairwoman of the local government committee, said 
after casting one of the two votes against Beverly's bill. "Land-use planning 
around airports is going to become increasingly important as air transportation 
continues to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, supported by the Los Angeles County branch of the League of California 
Cities, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Cities are just not going to accept that kind of zoning law being imposed on 
them," he said after Wednesday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
What riles many Los Angeles County cities is that the Legislature has 
designated the Regional Planning Commission as the airport planning agency for 
Los Angeles County. The commission lacks the staff to handle the workload 
involved in planning land use around the county's airports, and it is less 
responsive than cities to local conditions, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The cities also argue that their airports, unlike those in other parts of the 
state, are already surrounded by development. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the county's cities have lined up behind Beverly's bill. A 
conspicuous dissenter is Los Angeles, which is concerned about urban 
development encroaching on the airport it plans to build in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
"Without some sort of regional planning authority for airports, we run the risk 
of having incompatible land uses in close proximity to the planned Palmdale 
Airport," said Norman Boyer, the city's chief lobbyist in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Such arguments are echoed by the California Commission on Aviation and 
Airports, a legislative advisory panel that also opposes Beverly's bill. The 
commission says encroaching development has played a key role in the closing of 
18 of California's publicly used airports in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Development occurs, complaints about safety and noise come up, and pretty soon 
you have a process that snowballs," said Christopher Thompson, a consultant to 
the commission. "It's a scenario we've seen played out over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of seeing that process occur in Torrance worries many of the 
area's pilots. A group of Torrance-based pilots sued the city last year to 
block a housing project on Lomita Boulevard beneath the airport's departure 
flight pattern. The suit was dropped after Los Angeles County cities pressured 
the Legislature to delay implementation of the land-use requirement locally 
until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly acknowledges that his bill may have to be amended to pass. The vote 
Wednesday was only its first hurdle: The measure must still clear the full 
Senate, make its way through the Assembly committee system and survive a vote 
in the lower chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said she hopes that legislators can work out a compromise that will 
give airport land-use planning authority to some type of regional commission, 
one that could include representatives of cities. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly said he would prefer to see the bill stay intact, permanently exempting 
Los Angeles County from Bergeson's law. But he indicated that political 
realities may force him to consider compromises. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got a long way to go," Beverly said.

CULVER CITY BLOCKS SHOT AT BAN ON BASKETBALL IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE HAGSTROM, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Council has ruled against a proposal to ban basketball games at 
Veterans Park, favoring instead a six-month trial period to see if two 
community service officers, newly hired to patrol the parks, could alleviate 
problems at the basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who live in the area have complained that the two courts sometimes 
attract more than 50 players and spectators at a time. And with them, neighbors 
say, come alcohol, loud music, fights and obscene language. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 75 people crowded into a special meeting on the subject Wednesday night, 
and two distinct factions became apparent. Homeowners who live near the park 
and who favor a ban sat on the left; rows of basketball players and their 
supporters were on the right. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal for the ban, introduced by the Human Services and Park 
Commission, had been successful, it would have been the second time since 1982 
that the city prohibited basketball in one of its parks. It was banned at Fox 
Hills Park under similar circumstances eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Wednesday said that if the officers could not solve the 
problems at the park, stricter measures would follow. 
</P>
<P>
Other options discussed were moving the court to another part of the park or 
building a full court at Culver City Park, which is in an industrial section of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents to the ban argued that relocation is not the answer, maintaining that 
it would only serve to move the problem to another area. Several basketball 
players questioned why the authorities are not simply policing the area more 
often and ridding the park of the people who are disrupting the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected a second HSPC proposal to utilize armed park rangers, and 
instead decided to test first the effectiveness of the unarmed officers, who 
are authorized to give citations and make arrests. The park officers will also 
carry walkie-talkies to get police backup. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, residents claimed they are "prisoners in their own homes." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball players argued that banning the game at Veterans Park would not 
solve the problem, but rather unjustly punish the majority for the actions of a 
few. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Buday, who moved to her home on Coombs Avenue in 1988, recounted an 
incident in which a man vomited in her front yard after shouting obscenities at 
her. She said alcohol, booming car stereos, people urinating on neighbors' 
lawns and double-parking in front of her driveway were common events on her 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Jerald Ryckman, 40, said: "It is being concluded rather hastily that the 
basketball players are causing these problems. I strongly and vehemently state 
that it is not these players." Ryckman said he was a "seven-year veteran of the 
Vets Park basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
Several residents supported his claim, some suggesting that there were other 
reasons for attacking this particular sport in a park that is popularly 
frequented at night by many groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this has been exaggerated out of all proportion of what is going on," 
said resident Holly Harrie. "I think maybe there is an undercurrent racial 
issue that nobody here really wants to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
But other residents maintained that they were not looking to ban the sport, but 
merely to move it to a more appropriate location. "What we are after is not the 
stoppage of play," said Tracy Thomas, who lives near the park. "What we have 
been looking for in pursuing this for one year is relocation to where a really 
good, aggressive game can be played. . . . The play as it exists in Vets is 
really not fitting in a neighborhood situation."

RESIDENTS USE MEETING TO AIR DOUBTS ON PLAN FOR BKK LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About three dozen residents, many of them veterans of the long fight against 
the BKK Corp. landfill, last week warned state health officials that plans for 
a renaissance at the once-toxic dump may backfire. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be a lot more thought given to this," George Tracy, chairman of 
the city's Waste Management and Environmental Planning Commission, told state 
health officials, who on Wednesday met with local residents to discuss the 
future of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
Six years have passed since the BKK Corp. last accepted hazardous wastes at the 
landfill, once Southern California's primary spot to discard toxic chemicals, 
and BKK officials now have asked the state for what is known as a "post-closure 
permit." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the West Covina Senior Citizens Center, was an informal 
preview of the permit proceedings that are expected to occur throughout the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
As required by the state Department of Health Services, which enforces state 
laws regarding the dump, the company already has filed a draft of its plans for 
maintaining the closed, toxic portion of the landfill for the next 30 years. A 
formal hearing on the permit will be held later this year. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, Nancy E. Adin, who lives about a half-mile from the 
landfill and is a college chemistry teacher who often has questioned activities 
at the dump, gave an intense critique of BKK's plans for improvements, which 
company officials say have cost $38 million. Some of her strongest comments 
involved landscaping on the 140-acre, clay-covered mound of hazardous trash 
that rises hundreds of feet above surrounding neighborhoods. "The vegetation 
and maintenance is a farce. I'm tired of looking at ugly slopes." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Sorsher, an associate waste management engineer in the Department of 
Health Services, addressed the criticism by telling the audience that BKK "was 
doing a pretty fair job, landscaping notwithstanding," in complying with state 
and federal regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
BKK still operates a 443-acre municipal garbage dump at the site. But the 
140-acre toxic chemicals section was officially closed last year and stopped 
accepting hazardous wastes in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to continue operating the landfill until 1995. Tentative 
proposals by BKK call for developing the land around the site as an industrial 
park. Also under consideration is a plan to build a subdivision of luxury homes 
on adjacent land in Walnut. The West Covina City Council, acting jointly as the 
city's redevelopment agency, on Monday will resume its earlier discussions on 
whether the area around the landfill should become a business park. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents who spoke at the hearing questioned such development plans, 
citing issues that relate to toxic chemicals, including the cancer-causing 
substance vinyl chloride. Royall Brown, a West Covina resident and a board 
member of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, expressed his 
fears about the dangers the substance may pose. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board records show that high levels 
of vinyl chloride have moved underground, said Brown, who blames the landfill. 
"It raises real questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sorsher said he hadn't seen the specific records cited by Brown, but is 
familiar with the situation. However, Sorsher said he saw no immediate public 
health hazard from the vinyl chloride. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are still in the process of conducting health studies to see how 
the landfill might have influenced residents' cancer rates, cancer risk and 
birth defects. Eleanor Blake, a community relations coordinator for the 
Department of Health Services, told those at the meeting that results of some 
of the studies may be released in September.

EX-LYNWOOD EMPLOYEE ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former employee of the city of Lynwood is scheduled for a preliminary hearing 
Tuesday in Compton Municipal Court on charges of embezzling an estimated 
$45,000 from the city housing rehabilitation program for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Picou, 32, of Gardena is accused of fraudulently withdrawing money from 
escrow accounts set up for the program, Sheriff's Detective Wayne White said. 
</P>
<P>
White said Picou established a bogus company to receive the money. "He would 
authorize payment to a company called Unlimited Concrete. Picou and Unlimited 
were one and the same; he was paying himself," White said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's housing and community development manager, Clarence Williams, 
accused Picou of "authorizing payments for non-existent work for a non-existent 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Picou, who had worked for the city since 1987, resigned as senior housing 
rehabilitation specialist in December, 1989, following allegations that he had 
continued to do work as an outside contractor while being employed by the city, 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials discovered the alleged embezzlement scheme after Picou left, 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Picou has been free on his own recognizance since his arraignment March 12. He 
faces a maximum sentence of nine years in prison if convicted on all 12 felony 
counts of embezzlement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Saria said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Picou or his attorney, Ted T. Yamamoto, could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The city has temporarily suspended the rehabilitation program on the 
recommendation of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which 
provided funding for it, HUD spokesman Scott Reed said. A private firm is 
conducting an internal audit of the program "to make sure checks and balances 
are in place and there is proper supervisory control," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope the program will be able to resume next month, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation program provides low-income residents with loans of up to 
$30,000 at 3% interest to make home improvements.

DISABLED DECLARE INDEPENDENCE IN SIERRA MADRE

SIERRA MADRE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joann Seaman, 41, received her fine arts degree in 1972. A few months ago, she 
mastered the task of folding a sheet at the Center for Living Independence for 
the Multi-handicapped Blind (CLIMB). 
</P>
<P>
"I did well in school, but I couldn't do anything or go anywhere on my own," 
said Seaman, who is blind, with slight brain damage that has not impaired her 
academic aptitude but has left her unable to perform household tasks such as 
making a bed. "If I hadn't come here (to CLIMB), I would have still needed 
someone to take care of me all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Nestled among quaint small-town shops on Sierra Madre Boulevard, CLIMB is 
believed to be the only facility in the San Gabriel Valley where basic living, 
communication and vocational skills are taught to adult blind people with 
developmental disabilities. Only one other program in the county, Therapeutic 
Living Centers for the Blind in Reseda, offers similar residential care, said 
Judy Poindexter, director of the San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center, which 
coordinates services for the developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two programs serve about 140 adults in Los Angeles County, which, 
according to state figures, has 1,378 adults who are both blind and 
developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"These are just the people who are registered with us; heaven knows how many 
others are out there that we don't know about," said Roberta Marlowe of the 
state Department of Developmental Services, which oversees the 21 regional 
centers that coordinate services for the developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Many of CLIMB's students, like Seaman, were premature babies born in the late 
1940s and early '50s who were placed in incubators and given too much oxygen. 
They later developed retrolental fibroplasia, which causes blindness and brain 
damage. The program's 94 residents vary in degree of handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter said there are schools for the blind and programs for the 
developmentally disabled, but little residential care for those with both 
problems. In addition, most programs are geared to those under the age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
CLIMB, which opened in July, 1977, with 18 students, is filled to capacity and 
has a waiting list of 80. The program, in addition to the Sierra Madre complex, 
operates a home in Alhambra for blind adults with more severe emotional and 
mental disabilities. It also operates a halfway house in Sierra Madre for those 
who are almost ready to live on their own. And, for those one step away from 
complete independence, it runs an apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
The founder and executive director of CLIMB, Bill Young, said the private 
facility has an annual budget of about $1.4 million. He said most students pay 
their way with state disability payments and supplements. Costs range from $250 
a month for those who live in private apartments to $2,000 a month for students 
in the Alhambra home. 
</P>
<P>
Young's idea for the facility came when he was working at the Foundation for 
the Junior Blind in Los Angeles. He noticed that foundation students sent home 
after the age of 21 "would regress. They would just sit around and do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big problem," said David Ekin, program director at the Foundation 
for the Junior Blind. "When our students become adults, there is no place for 
them to go. Many go back home, and the parents don't know what to do. Some try 
to find a day program, and some end up in programs that are not designed for 
their particular needs." 
</P>
<P>
CLIMB is designed to continue education for adults between the ages of 18 and 
65, emphasizing basic living skills, such as making meals, riding a bus, 
balancing a budget and preparing for a job interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has ever showed them how to be independent," said Wendy Matsutani, 
residential director at the school. "Many of these students will always need 
supervision, but at least they'll be able to dress themselves and make their 
own beds." 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with its theory of promoting independence, the school operates a 
gift shop that sells items handcrafted by students. On display are wind chimes, 
tie-dyed scarfs, greeting cards and Christmas tree ornaments. The students also 
put on musical shows for the local senior citizen center and nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
The CLIMB complex is within walking distance of downtown shops and services. 
After completing a special training course, students are allowed to travel on 
their own. Tapping red-tipped white canes, they walk to nearby stores, coffee 
shops and restaurants; some take the bus to Pasadena City College or Santa 
Anita Fashion Park. 
</P>
<P>
For most, this is their first taste of independence. Before coming to CLIMB, 
many lived at home with overprotective parents or in a board and care facility 
or state institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Before coming here, I never cooked or cleaned. . . . My mother did everything 
for me," said Caryn Silverman, 39, who lives in the halfway house. "Now, I take 
the bus to Santa Anita mall. . . . I'm hoping to move into my own apartment 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best tribute to CLIMB is a song written by Seaman about the center: 
</P>
<P>
 ... We'll climb with a smile to let other people know we're just like everyone 
else.... 
</P>
<P>
 Together we'll climb with people who'll show us the way.

WINDOW DESIGNER IS SHOWN THE DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 1988, the year that credulous Angelenos trembled for fear of earthquake 
predictions in the writings of a 16th-Century French astrologer, and the 
windows of the Camp Beverly Hills store had a message of their own: 
"Nostradamus Says Relax." 
</P>
<P>
A painted fault line split the store's facade, and a mechanical hand waved back 
and forth, swinging a shopping bag and clutching an airline ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The display was an eye-catcher, part of the insouciant appeal that makes Camp 
Beverly Hills one of the most distinctive clothing shops along Santa Monica 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But Camp Beverly Hills is rethinking its image, and provocative window-dressing 
is out for now at the shop that once sold clothing with a display labeled "The 
Last Temptation of Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
That one was also striking, with the head of the late, chubby rock-and-roll 
star imposed on a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's famous fresco, and the floor 
littered with fast-food wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
Another window celebrated the Los Angeles victory over Detroit's professional 
basketball team by displaying a urinal, labeled "Lakers 1," and a toilet, 
"Pistons No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
But shoppers will be seeing more standard windows from now on. The creator of 
the message windows, Lisa Verlo, said she was let go last week after eight 
years on the job after a bit of controversy that might bring to mind Andy 
Warhol's question: Is it soup or is it art? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, designer names are going to attract some people," Verlo said, "but 
you're going to lose the people who go for the funky part of it. There's plenty 
of artistic mediums I can get into, but I worry that all of Beverly Hills and 
L.A. is going to go conservative in the window department." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not shifting focus permanently, but we're constantly trying to do 
something fresh," said Camp Beverly Hills co-owner Jeff Stein. 
</P>
<P>
Stein said he hoped to work with Verlo, who he said is very talented, on a 
free-lance basis in the future, but for now, the message of the windows will 
concentrate on clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to do provocative statements that are fun and image-building, but at 
the same time show product," he said. Of the previous displays, he said, 
"Sometimes they get a little obscure." 
</P>
<P>
The latest one declared, in huge letters, NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ART LERY, 
a visual pun about the controversy over censorship in federal funding for the 
arts versus military spending. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the windows were creative and amusing, and they did catch the eye," 
Beverly Hills City Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not so much the message as the size of the letters that drew the 
attention of Beverly Hills building inspector Mike Basanti. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that some people use excessive signage," said Basanti, who has 
been discussing window displays with Camp Beverly Hills executives for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Basanti said that competing merchants asked, "What about Camp Beverly Hills?" 
when he called them to task for the size of the "SALE SALE SALE" signs in 
neighboring windows. 
</P>
<P>
"(Camp Beverly Hills) claim it is artistic work," he said, "but I was thinking 
that it might be signs." 
</P>
<P>
He referred the question to the city attorney's office, but Assistant City 
Atty. Larry Wiener said that no ruling was forthcoming because a more modest 
display -- clothing and the names of two designers -- had taken the place of 
"ART LERY" by the time he drove by to take a look. 
</P>
<P>
Stein said the Basanti's interest had nothing to do with the new look at Camp 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that we have some new designers in the store, and we wanted to let 
people know about it. Change is the key," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Beverly Hills on Little Santa Monica is one of two stores owned by the 
Stein and his partner, John Lasker. Ten outlets around the country are operated 
by franchise owners. Stein and Lasker also sell a line of clothing with the 
same name in department stores.

PEOPLE: CUB SCOUTMASTER LEADS THE PACK IN VOLUNTEER EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For 10 years before Mark Wright came on the scene, there were no Cub Scouts in 
Beverly Hills. The program was the victim of declining elementary school 
enrollment and a lack of volunteer parents. 
</P>
<P>
So when Wright's son, Darrin, wanted to join the Scouts a few years ago, he had 
nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, some of the other parents and I got together and decided we wanted our 
kids to be in Cub Scouts," said Wright, 42, who was a Cub Scout as a boy in 
Merced. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the parents re-established Beverly Hills' Pack 100 and chose Wright to 
be its first Cubmaster. 
</P>
<P>
But the Scouts again ran into the problems of 10 years ago, and during the 
first year the pack was really only a den of six Cubs. Then Wright came up with 
an inspired idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, a Cub pack is usually for one school," said Wright, who by day is 
the director of Packard Bell Financial Services. "What I did was combine all 
four (Beverly Hills elementary schools) into one Cub pack. That way we were 
able to draw support from the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
As word spread about the re-emergence of Cub Scouting in the city, Pack 100 
grew from six boys to 30 the next year, to 50 the next, and today boasts about 
100 Scouts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For his work, Wright was recently named "Cubmaster of the Year" by the Scouts' 
Crescent Bay District, which includes most of the Cub packs in the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Scouting) is extremely important in this day and age," said Wright, 
whose pack is involved in everything from food drives for the needy to planting 
trees in Maltz Park. "It gives the kids a sense of camaraderie . . . and it 
brings back a grass-roots involvement in the community that they don't get in 
any other activity." 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City Unified School District has named Laura Plasse as the new 
principal at Culver City High School. Plasse, the principal of Beaumont High 
School in Riverside County, will succeed Principal Glenn Cook, who will retire 
at the end of this school year. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Malcolm D. Cosgrove, a West Los Angeles physician, was reelected for a 
second one-year term as president of Sinai Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Also elected were six vice presidents: Judy Galperson, education; Dr. Paul 
Herman, ritual; Milton Hyman, membership; Jules Porter, community relations; 
Victor Sabah, finance, and Dorothy Salkin, administration. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar received the UCLA Alumni Assn.'s highest 
honor, the Edward A. Dickson "Alumnus of the Year" award at the group's 45th 
Annual Alumni Awards for Excellence ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, who retired last year after 20 years in the National Basketball 
Assn., led UCLA basketball teams to three national championships from 1966-69. 
</P>
<P>
Also honored at the ceremony was U.S. Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), 
who received an "Honorary Alumnus" award for his efforts to promote federal 
support of research programs and facilities at the university. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA Alumni Assn. honored five UCLA graduates with Professional Achievement 
Awards. They are: Diane Freis, a fashion designer and founder of clothing 
manufacturer Diane Freis Enterprises; attorney Geraldine Hemmerling, the first 
woman president of the American College of Probate Counsel; Kenneth Karst, UCLA 
law professor; Army Gen. Louis Menetrey, commander-in-chief of the U.N. Command 
in South Korea, and James F. Montgomery, chairman and chief executive officer 
of Great Western Financial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount University has named Joseph G. Jabbra, academic and research 
vice president at St. Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as its new 
academic vice president. He succeeds Albert Koppes, who, after a sabbatical, 
will return as professor of education. 
</P>
<P>
The university also announced the hiring of Gerald S. Jakubowski, interim dean 
of engineering at Memphis State University, as the new dean of the College of 
Science and Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Grebler Sinaiko of Beverly Hills received the Eleanor Roosevelt Medallion 
from the American Friends of Tel Aviv University at its annual Benefactors' 
Ball at the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The award was in recognition of Sinaiko's record of humanitarian service, which 
includes work with United Jewish Appeal, the Golda Meir Group of State of 
Israel Bonds and the Temple Israel Sisterhood. SHELDON ITO

AT HOME: BIG-CITY LIVING ON SMALL-TOWN SCALE; 
</P>
<P>
WOODLAND HILLS: RESIDENTS OF VALLEY COMMUNITY ENJOY LIVING CLOSE TO JOBS, 
SHOPPING AND RECREATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1949, when Rosemary Woodlock moved to Woodland Hills as a child, there were 
only about 800 residents in the rural West San Fernando Valley community. 
Ranches and groves of walnut trees stretched from the steep hills where the 
Woodlock family lived, to Canoga Park to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Only one traffic signal on Ventura Boulevard at Cahuenga Boulevard delayed 
drivers making the trip from Woodland Hills to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Woodlock, Southern California project manager for Trust for Public Land, still 
lives near the top of the mountains, close to an unpaved stretch of Mulholland 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the silence up here," she said. "It's heavenly to sit out in the back. 
A bobcat might wander across the yard. A pair of red-tail hawks nest here every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The darkness at night makes you feel far from the city, yet it only takes six 
minutes to drive down to Ventura Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Although remnants of the rural ambience remain, today's Woodland Hills is a far 
cry from Woodlock's childhood memories. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Center, a regional business, shopping and residential hub, has replaced 
the barley fields and walnut groves. Weekday traffic often jams Ventura 
Boulevard, the Ventura Freeway and adjacent streets. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills, part of the city of Los Angeles, is bounded by Victory 
Boulevard on the north, Corbin Avenue on the east, Calabasas on the west and 
Mulholland Drive and the Santa Monica Mountains on the south. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they live in hillside single-family houses or the apartments and condos 
of Warner Center, residents say that proximity to jobs, shopping and recreation 
are major pleasures of living there. 
</P>
<P>
"Warner Center has a small-town atmosphere in a big-city climate," said 
Kathleen Sterling, publisher of Warner Center News, a biweekly business 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"You see people biking and walking to work. At noon people put on tennis shoes 
to take a walk or they cross the street to lunch at nearby restaurants. In the 
summer, people flock to the concerts in the park." 
</P>
<P>
Concerts in the park are one of the reasons why Richard Anderson and his wife, 
Marie, enjoy living in Warner Hills Town Homes, a complex across De Soto Avenue 
from Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago when Anderson, vice president of finance with Legacy Broadcasting 
in West Los Angeles, was transferred to California from Connecticut, he and 
Marie looked at homes from Pasadena to Ventura County. They wanted a house that 
would go with their traditional furnishings and not require extensive 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"When we found this townhouse in Woodland Hills, I felt we could be very happy 
here," Marie Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Andersons have become active in the townhome association, where Marie 
produces the newsletter and serves as secretary, and Richard acts as treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"I walk to the post office and to Irvine Ranch Market," Marie said. "My husband 
walks to "The Firm", an exercise club. Many people like to live here if they 
work in Warner Center because they can avoid the freeway. There is traffic 
during the week, but on the weekends it is very quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1950s, when major high-tech industries began to locate in the West 
Valley, Woodland Hills was a sleepy country community. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the 20th Century, Brant Rancho, the largest barley and wheat ranch in 
the area, stretched from the mountains north to Owensmouth, now Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
In 1923, Victor Girard, a colorful real estate pioneer, opened the town site of 
Girard, on the hillside south of Ventura Boulevard. To appeal to prospective 
buyers, Girard's company, the Boulevard Land Co., imported and planted more 
than 120,000 young pepper trees, sycamores, eucalyptuses and pines -- trees 
that later would give the community its name of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Girard undertook an aggressive sales campaign aimed at Midwesterners and 
Easterners who were coming to California to retire. Lots began at $500. Choice 
properties along Ventura and Topanga boulevards sold for $5,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
During the Depression of the 1930s, the dream town collapsed amid lawsuits, and 
many investors, including Girard, abandoned their holdings. Those who remained 
formed the nucleus of what was to become Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, Harry Warner of Warner Bros. Pictures began Brant Rancho. An avid 
thoroughbred horse breeder, he built a large home overlooking his holdings on a 
hill that became known as Warner Ridge, at the corner of De Soto Avenue and 
Oxnard Street. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Pierce College, covering 427 acres to the north of Warner Ridge, 
was started in the late '40s as an agricultural campus. Although agriculture is 
no longer the school's prime focus, the open acres, barns and farm animals 
contrast with the sleek high-rise buildings of Warner Center across De Soto. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the country atmosphere and inexpensive tract homes drew residents 
who wanted to raise their families away from the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We were drawn to the area because of the country feeling," said Ernest Zehms, 
a retired engineer who moved his family to a postwar ranch house in the hills 
just west of Topanga Canyon Boulevard in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first lived here, you could see the Basque sheepherders with their 
flocks of sheep up on the hill," he said. "There wasn't a grade school nearby, 
and my kids had to go over the hill to Woodland Hills Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't many other houses up here. Most of the houses in Woodland Hills 
were built between 1955 and 1970. Small developers would buy several lots and 
build the same style house on each lot, possibly reversing the floor plan." 
</P>
<P>
Farther to the east, at the edge of Tarzana, large custom homes were built on 
subdivisions carved from private estates. 
</P>
<P>
"People up here like their privacy," said Rosalind Zane, an audiologist who 
lives in a six-bedroom contemporary home built in 1965 on a wooded acre, 
originally part of Forest Hills Estate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the end of the world," said her husband, Martin Zane, a plastic 
surgeon who practices in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everyone up here has a pool, and some have tennis courts. We moved here 
because it's a very isolated area, but only a short distance from Ventura 
Boulevard, where our son and daughter could take public transportation to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we're secluded, you can see the mountains and the expanse of the 
Valley when it's clear," he added. 
</P>
<P>
While the amenities make Woodland Hills an attractive area for both homeowners 
and renters, the desirability carries a high price tag. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tack on at least $25,000 to a property if it's in Woodland Hills, and 
even more in the hills, depending on condition," says Laura Lee, an agent in 
Jon Douglas' Woodland Hills office. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said that prices for townhomes and condos in or near Warner Center begin at 
about $175,000. Townhomes with several bedrooms, more than one level of living 
space, fireplaces and patios in lush landscaping begin at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
To the north, adjacent to Canoga Park, the typical three-bedroom, two-bath 
family home built in the late 1950s will cost $250,000 or more. In Carleton 
Terrace, an area located between Pierce College and the Ventura Freeway, houses 
built in the 1960s cost from $350,000 to $425,000. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Center apartment complexes with fountains, streams and luxuriant foliage 
rent from $950 for a two-bedroom unit to $1,200 for three bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Woodland Hills south of the boulevard is an extremely varied area. You will 
find mini-castles in "Westchester County" -- a gated community -- large custom 
homes in the hills, as well as tract and smaller custom homes," Rosalind Zane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Prices south of Ventura Boulevard reflect the housing diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Flint of Formost Realty/Woodland Hills, says custom houses west of Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard are priced from $250,000 up. 
</P>
<P>
In the Girard tract, the oldest residential section of Woodland Hills, which 
extends from Serrania Street on the east to Topanga Canyon Boulevard on the 
west and from Dumetz south to Mulholland Drive, lots can be quite small, and 
were originally designed for cabins. Here prices are erratic, starting around 
$250,000 and going up to $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
Near Tarzana, prices for large custom homes are high -- $750,000 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Scant open space remains for new construction, and plans for these areas have 
provoked bitter disputes between homeowners and builders. 
</P>
<P>
In January, several hundred residents trooped to City Hall to a City Council 
hearing that determined the zoning for Warner Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Ridge Associates, a joint venture of the Spound Corp. of Century City 
and Johnson Wax, proposed building an 810,000-square-foot office complex, 
including seven office buildings, a restaurant and parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodland Hills Homeowners' Assn., representing about 600 households, 
persuaded Councilwoman Joy Picus to back a proposal to zone the property RS, a 
designation they say will allow more than 100 single-family homes. The group 
vows that commercial development will not cross De Soto Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We support responsible development that must be consistent with the general 
plan," said Bob Gross, president of the homeowners' group. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Ridge Associates disputes the new zoning and has filed a lawsuit against 
the city. "The zoning action has left us with no feasible use for the 
property," said Jack Spound, president of Spound Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners group also is fighting to retain the rustic atmosphere of the 
Girard Tract, where some streets are narrow and unpaved. An ordinance adopted 
in 1989 requires that new homes have frontage on a paved road at least 20 feet 
wide from the new house to the nearest intersecting highway . The builder of 
the new home is required to bear the cost of widening and paving an unimproved 
road. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also restricts the height and size of new houses on a small lots. 
</P>
<P>
"Inappropriately large houses on lots that were designed for cabins attract a 
large number of cars, some of which are stored on the street," Woodlock said. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic and speeding are problems on the narrow and winding roads. Some of the 
newer residents don't seem to care about the environment. They tear out the old 
walnut and oak trees. This violates the Girard Tract Ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Railla, a developer and framing contractor who wants to build a house on 
a lot he owns in Girard Tract, is frustrated by the strict regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"My plans, permits and construction loan have all been on hold for four 
months," he said. "I started to remove scrub oak bushes, but then we were 
stopped by Building and Safety who said they made a mistake when they issued my 
permit. I can appeal, but that means loss of my time and money." 
</P>
<P>
The problems of the hillside dwellers seem far away for those who live on the 
flats in Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ann B. Schmitt, a public relations consultant who represents the Woodland Hills 
Chamber of Commerce as well as many other local businesses, recently moved to a 
Warner Center apartment to be close to her business. 
</P>
<P>
"The apartment I rent is just a block and a half from my office," she said. "It 
is like an island, a sanctuary. There are rocks, waterfalls and lush 
landscaping. The living room has vaulted ceilings and a wood-burning fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
"Last weekend, when I stopped at Irvine Ranch Market, I ran into a couple of my 
clients. It's like living in a small town without sacrificing the amenities of 
the city."

SELLER FINANCING: PANACEA IN SLOW MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
MORTGAGE: BOTH BUYER AND SELLER BENEFIT FROM THIS TYPE OF FINANCING. TO SECURE 
IT, BUYER SHOULD INCLUDE THIS CONDITION IN THE PURCHASE OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and real 
estate broker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suppose you were asked to name the easiest method of financing a home purchase. 
What would you answer? VA mortgage? FHA mortgage? Assume an existing assumable 
mortgage already secured by the house? 
</P>
<P>
Those are all good answers. But they are not correct. 
</P>
<P>
The best answer is "seller financing." 
</P>
<P>
Many prospective home buyers have never heard of seller financing. 
Surprisingly, many real estate agents have never used it either. Seller 
financing means that the seller of the home finances all or part of the sales 
price, so the buyer doesn't have to go to a bank, S&amp;L or other lender to 
obtain a new loan. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the seller lends the buyer the money to buy the home. On Wall 
Street, it's called a leveraged buyout. The seller's security for the loan can 
be a mortgage, trust deed, land contract, contract for deed, contract of sale, 
agreement for sale or any other method where the property being sold is the 
security for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose you are buying a $150,000 house. You have a $15,000 down 
payment, can handle the closing costs, have a good job and a good credit 
history. The sellers, a nice elderly couple, own their home free and clear, but 
they plan to move to a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
Your offer of a $150,000 sales price, a $15,000 cash down payment and a 
$135,000 seller-financed first mortgage at, perhaps, 10% interest might meet 
their needs perfectly. The monthly interest payment of $1,125 will give the 
sellers excellent retirement income and a higher yield than they can probably 
earn elsewhere with equal safety. 
</P>
<P>
The big advantage of seller financing for the buyer is easy financing. Since 
the property being sold is the loan security, most sellers don't even check the 
buyer's income and credit history. However, most real estate agents can get a 
credit report on the buyer, so the seller will know if he or she pays the bills 
on time. 
</P>
<P>
From the buyer's viewpoint, a possible disadvantage might be that many sellers 
will only carry back financing for five to 10 years. However, since most buyers 
usually don't keep a home longer than 10 years, this really isn't a significant 
disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
The advantages of seller financing are numerous for home sellers. They include 
quick, easy sale for top dollar; excellent investment secured by a property the 
seller knows well, possible double profit if foreclosure becomes necessary and 
the seller reacquires the home to sell again for a second profit and a 
higher-yielding investment that is available elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The possible disadvantages for the seller include tying up equity instead of 
receiving cash, possible foreclosure hassle if the home buyer defaults and the 
risk that the house might drop in market value. 
</P>
<P>
Since the advantages of seller financing outweigh the slight disadvantages for 
buyer and seller, most home buyers want to know where homes with seller 
financing can be found. Unfortunately, few real estate listing agents encourage 
their sellers to carry back a first or second mortgage. So it is usually up to 
the home buyer to create seller financing. 
</P>
<P>
This is done when making the offer to purchase the home. If the home being sold 
is owned free and clear by the seller, this is a perfect candidate for seller 
financing. Or, if the home has an assumable first mortgage, such as one of the 
older VA or FHA home loans, the buyer can assume that loan and the seller can 
carry back a second mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Until the buyer makes a written purchase offer that provides for seller 
financing, many sellers have never considered the advantages of financing the 
sale of their home. I will always remember the 83-year-old home seller who 
carried back a 10-year mortgage when I bought her house. 
</P>
<P>
She told me the $1,033 I will be paying her each month is more money than she 
has ever earned before in her life. It enabled her to move into an apartment 
close to her children and to live in financial dignity without have to look to 
them for support. Until that lady saw my purchase offer on her kitchen table 
and the real estate agent explained the benefits, I don't think she had ever 
thought of financing the sale of her home. 
</P>
<P>
I find the best candidates for seller financed homes are those which have been 
owned a long time and are being sold by elderly sellers. Another good sign is a 
vacant house. That usually means the seller is not just testing the waters, but 
really must sell and will listen to any reasonable purchase offer. 
</P>
<P>
An even better signal of a possible seller financed home is when you learn from 
the real estate agent that the seller has already bought another home. Chances 
are, that seller is worried about the old home being vacant and is very anxious 
to have it sold. Seller financing can solve the problems of both home seller 
and buyer.

APARTMENT LIFE: CONVERSION SURPRISES NEW TENANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, Postema is the editor of Apartment Age magazine, a 
publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' 
service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Four months ago, we rented our Encino apartment on a month-to-month 
basis with the clear understanding that the owner would probably be selling in 
two years to convert to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
We have now learned that notices to vacate for the sale will be served to the 
tenants on the first of next month. Are we entitled to any relocation 
assistance money? If yes, how much? Also what is the status of our security 
deposit? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Assuming that your unit isn't exempted from rent control as a luxury 
unit, or new construction, you may be entitled to relocation money. 
</P>
<P>
Your security deposit, like all residential rental security deposits, is 
refundable, less expenses for cleaning, damages or unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles Municipal Code 151.09, you may also be exempted from 
the fees if you "received actual written notice, prior to entering into a 
written or oral tenancy agreement, that an application to subdivide the 
property for condominium, stock cooperative or community apartment purposes was 
on file with the city or had been approved, whichever the case may be. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The law clearly says you must be notified in writing of the owner's intent to 
convert. Assuming the owner gave you such a written notice in good faith, you 
probably are not entitled to the fees. If you are entitled to the fees, they 
are paid at the rate of $5,000 a unit for senior citizens, the handicapped or 
renters with minor dependent children. Others get $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Fleck, housing and planning economic analyst for Los Angeles' 
Rent Stabilization Division, "If the owner applied to the city to convert, and 
notified you of this in writing at the inception of the tenancy, then you would 
probably not be entitled to relocation fees." 
</P>
<P>
Fleck added, "If the owner knew the conversion would be occurring as soon as it 
is, and he told you it would take two years, then you might be entitled to some 
kind of civil relief in Small Claims or Municipal Court." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renter Can Take Steps to Evict Roommate 
</P>
<P>
Q: I rent a rather expensive apartment in Covina, and a few months ago, my 
roommate moved out. I rented out one bedroom in my apartment, with kitchen and 
bath privileges, to a young man who has not lived up to his end of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
He pays his rent whenever he wants to, does not pay his share of the utility 
bills and plays his stereo loud, causing the other tenants to complain. I have 
asked him to move out, but he says he will not. We have no written rental 
agreement. How can I get this guy out of my apartment? 
</P>
<P>
A: When you sublet to this tenant, you became a landlord, with all the rights 
and privileges attached thereto. Thus, you have the right to evict this tenant 
for breaching your implied, oral contract. 
</P>
<P>
You need only serve the tenant with a 30-day Notice to Quit (move out) in 
Covina, which is not rent controlled. However, if he doesn't move at the end of 
that time, you will probably need an eviction-specialist attorney to get rid of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
From the sound of your letter, this tenant doesn't sound very cooperative, so 
he may file frivolous court motions or a bankruptcy to delay the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the county Sheriff's Department and marshal's 
office, gathered by the California Apartment Law Information Foundation in its 
1989 statewide study of evictions, the average time lag from filing an unlawful 
detainer (eviction) action, to actual turnover of possession, is 80 to 90 days. 
The average loss (rents, attorney's fees, etc.) exceeds $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owner-Occupant May Evict Only One Tenant 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in Los Angeles, and my two brothers and I would like to buy a 
four-unit apartment house in Los Angeles. It's covered by the city's rent 
control law. The problem is that the only way we can afford to buy the building 
would be to live in three of the units. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the question. If we buy the building, can we evict three of the tenants 
to live there ourselves and rent the fourth unit? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. You cannot. The Los Angeles rent control law allows only one 
owner-occupancy eviction per apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
And whereas the law also allows an owner to evict a tenant to move in a 
resident manager, according to Anna Ortega, assistant director of Los Angeles' 
Rent Stabilization Division (RSD), "that's a loophole that the department is 
working on closing." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega also said that trying to buy a tenant out, for instance, offering him 
$5,000 to move, "is a collusion to avoid rent control. It would be 
unenforceable and unfavorably looked upon by the RSD." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Foot Above, Heavy Heart Below 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been living in the same West Hollywood apartment for seven years. For 
the past two years or so, I have been having a recurring problem with my 
upstairs neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
We live in a building with hardwood floors and terrible sound insulation. From 
time to time my upstairs neighbor forgets that her footsteps can be extremely 
loud and annoying unless she pays attention to the way she walks. It sounds as 
if she is marching around in my apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any law that you know of, similar to the one in New York, which says 
that apartments must be carpeted if the noise coming through the wood flooring 
is a nuisance? Failing that, do you have any suggestions about what I can do to 
alleviate this situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: I know of no such law in West Hollywood or anywhere else in the state of 
California. Short of requesting your neighbor's cooperation, which you have 
already tried, the only solutions to your problem may be sound-proofing your 
ceilings (which requires the consent of the owner) or moving to a new 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not All Deposits Given Back -- Just in Rentals 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in San Pedro, and I have a question about your June 10 Apartment Life 
column. Under the question "Deposits Cannot Be Non-Refundable," you said, 
"Non-refundable deposits of any kind have been prohibited in California for 
many years." 
</P>
<P>
Would you please clarify this statement? Do you mean that non-refundable 
deposits are prohibited just for rentals, or does it apply to other things? 
</P>
<P>
A: I was referring to security deposits for residential rentals when I answered 
that question. (Remember, no matter how it is labeled, every cent with which 
you part at the outset of your tenancy, other than the first month's rent, is a 
security deposit.) 
</P>
<P>
According to Peter Kingren, an analyst with the state attorney general's 
office, not all deposits in California are refundable. 
</P>
<P>
Kingren said, "If, for instance, I go out and put a $200 deposit down on a car, 
and then change my mind about buying the car, that deposit could be 
non-refundable."

ON SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It must have been astonishing to all to read the unnoticeable caption on Sam 
Hall Kaplan's departure from the L.A. Times (June 3). 
</P>
<P>
With great irony the Real Estate's lead article about termites leaves me 
wondering whether the pests have already begun to take their toll on your 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of this section have removed the backbone, which has so 
strengthened for so long what little spine existed in the Real Estate pages. 
</P>
<P>
Now you have a rather odd collection of slithering media-hyped articles 
appealing to a primordial readership at best.

ON SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I mourn the loss of Sam Hall Kaplan's column from the pages of the Los Angeles 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan has consistently offered us welcome food for thought. 
</P>
<P>
His menu has been full -- planning, urban design, architecture new and old, 
relationships between people and places, between government and private 
enterprise -- all spiced with humor and seasoned with his unique personal 
opinion. After partaking, we sometimes found ourselves gratified, sometimes 
chagrined, but always stirred, always challenged to think. 
</P>
<P>
Whether complimenting or poking fun at the Los Angeles built environment and 
its creators, Kaplan, above all else, called for more sensitivity and more 
humanity in our communities. His contribution has been a positive one, and we 
are richer for it. His witty and provocative words will be sorely missed.

J. ALVAREZ, TOP BEVERLY HILLS BROKER, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Juan Alvarez, one of the top real estate brokers in Beverly Hills, died June 16 
of a heart attack while visiting his family in his native Caracas, Venezuela. 
He was 48. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was a partner and vice president of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young, a 
boutique realty firm that he helped establish in 1977. The company has a staff 
of 50 and is the fourth largest office in Beverly Hills in terms of size and 
volume, doing $300 million in sales a year, according to Jeff Hyland, president 
of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez worked for another Beverly Hills broker, Stan Herman, before joining 
Hyland and Elaine Young to found his company. 
</P>
<P>
"On a dare, he went into real estate in 1975, and within one year, he was one 
of the most successful brokers," Hyland said. "Two years after he got into the 
business, I called him to see if he'd like to start a company with Elaine and 
me, and 20 minutes after we met to discuss it, we shook hands on the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Before going into real estate, Alvarez was an actor. He left Caracas as a young 
man for Europe, where he lived and worked in the entertainment industry. Then 
he married, came to the United States, was graduated from UCLA and had a son, 
Alexis, who is 17. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his son, survivors include two brothers, three sisters and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 4 p.m. June 28 in St. Paul the Apostle 
church, 10750 Ohio Ave., Westwood.

ADVICE TO HOME SELLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a request to homeowners who are thinking of selling in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
If your home is for sale and has not attracted any offers, rethink your 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
If you would like to sell versus have to sell, you'd be much better off taking 
your home off the market. If you have to sell, price your home according to the 
sales made in 1990, not 1989 or 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In many neighborhoods, homes that sold for $350,000 in 1988 are now selling for 
under $300,000. 1990 has been a buyer's market and buyers are not paying last 
year's prices for homes. Less than one-third of the homes for sale in 1990 have 
sold. About half of the rest will not sell. However, at a right price, almost 
every home will sell. 
</P>
<P>
Average sales time for a $275,000 home is almost 120 days (according to data 
from May sales from the San Fernando Board of Realtors). With the longer time 
on the market, the cost of selling -- advertising, mailing, promotions -- 
increases per sale and the net profit decreases. 
</P>
<P>
So, homeowners, do yourself a favor -- if you must sell in 1990, price it 
right. If you can wait out the slump, please do. Besides, buyers are making low 
offers as well as various demands on sellers and many deals are broken as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a buyer, 1990 is your year. Prices are more favorable than in the 
last two to three years.

WATER-SAVING CLASSES FLOURISH IN DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Smaus 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years of drought have prompted some interesting classes, seminars and even 
sales scheduled for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Drip Irrigation for the Home Gardener" is a one-day UCLA Extension program on 
Saturday, July 7, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Paul Moore, horticultural specialist at 
the University of California, Riverside will instruct. 
</P>
<P>
"Xeriscape: Gardening for a Dry Climate," taught by Kathleen Sommer, 
horticultural consultant with Roger's Gardens, meets on five Wednesday 
evenings, 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., at UCLA, July 18-August 15. The fee is $95. 
</P>
<P>
You can enroll in either class by phone using a credit card; call UCLA 
Extension at (213) 825-7093 for registration information. 
</P>
<P>
The William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom has scheduled "Gardening with Natives 
Nature Walk" on Sunday, July 29, at 10 a.m. Join a professional gardener and 
nature guide to learn about the large assortment of plants to choose from for 
your garden. Meet at the Sooky Goldman Nature Center, 2600 Franklin Canyon 
Drive, Beverly Hills. The event is free. For more information call (213) 
858-3834. 
</P>
<P>
The Theodore Payne Foundation is having a special summer sale of native plants, 
from June 26-June 30, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily. The foundation's nursery, 
which has over 600 species to browse through, is at 10459 Tuxford St., Sun 
Valley. Call (818) 768-1802 for additional information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lotusland Conserved 
</P>
<P>
Lotusland, the grand and somewhat whimsical estate of the late Madame Ganna 
Walska in Santa Barbara, has become the second garden sponsored by the Garden 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy is a newly formed group dedicated to preserving notable gardens 
throughout the United States (though the first two sponsored gardens happen to 
be in California, the Ruth Bancroft garden in Walnut Creek being the other). 
The Conservancy hopes to help Lotusland get the necessary permits to allow 
visitors. For the moment, visits are restricted to groups with a horticultural 
or botanical affiliation (they may request visits to Lotusland by contacting 
Dr. Steven Tambrook, Director, Ganna Walska Lotusland, 695 Ashley Road, Santa 
Barbara, Calif. 93103.) 
</P>
<P>
For more information, write the Garden Conservancy at 1388 Sutter St., San 
Francisco, Calif. 94109. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zoo Plants Labeled 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park is as full of interesting plants as it is 
of animals, but they have never been labeled or identified. Now some 600 have 
labels and 300 more are on order. As volunteer Joan Booke points out, "this is 
not the Huntington and the plants are not as manicured, so it is a good place 
to see what trees and shrubs for Southern California look like with minimal 
care," such as they might receive in a garden. It is hoped that by next spring, 
tours of the plants at the zoo will be offered. -- R.S. 
</P>
<P>
Gray Water System 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara gardeners should sit up and take note, using gray water is now OK 
in their drought-stricken town (in other parts of the state, it is a murky 
legal question though many have gone ahead and installed devices). 
</P>
<P>
Gray water is the waste water from washing machines, sinks, showers and 
bathtubs. One of the earliest proponents of its use, Robert Kourick, is selling 
a kit for around $400 that takes the safest of gray water, from the washing 
machine, filters and stores it, then pumps it out to any drip system that is 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of water runs through a washing machine and this is one way to make it do 
double duty. He even offers a specially-developed laundry soap that acts as a 
mild fertilizer in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
The basic kit includes all the pumps and plumbing and is a snap to install. For 
information on The Water Cycle, write to Robert Kourick, P.O. Box 1841, Santa 
Rosa, Calif., 95402, or call (707) 874-2606. Kourick also publishes the only 
book the subject, also available from him. Robert Smaus

NATURE'S OWN WATER-TIGHT DESIGNS; 
</P>
<P>
CACTUSES: ARBORETUM HOSTS SHOW AND SALE OF PLANTS THAT THRIVE ON A WATER DIET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Teddy Colbert 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plants custom-designed by nature for water conservation will be available at 
the 25th annual show and sale sponsored by the Cactus and Succulent Society of 
America at the Arboretum, June 29 and 30 and July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Specimens of silver cactus and succulents from every continent except 
Antarctica will mark the silver anniversary of the oldest continuous Cacti and 
Succulent Show in the United States. They will also illustrate leaf 
modifications that conserve water within plant tissue. 
</P>
<P>
The silver-toned plants include those with waxy coatings that slow 
transpiration, or water loss, through the leaf surface. A newly introduced 
example from Asia is Orostachys 'Warenge' from Japan, whose waxy variegated 
leaves form a smooth rosette. 
</P>
<P>
Another modification of the leaf's upper epidermal layer results in woolly 
silvery hairs that lower leaf tissue temperature by providing insulation from 
the sun and reducing the effect of wind. 
</P>
<P>
One popular hirsute group is the North American Mammillaria from Mexico. The 
abundant soft white hair of M. hahniana Superba, called the "old lady" cactus, 
and M. plumosa, called the "feather cactus," beg for a pat but not all members 
of the family are so benign, warns Joe Clements, curator of the Huntington 
Desert Garden and show manager. "No one who handles M. senilis, 'the old man 
cactus,' " Clements says, "will forget the terrible hooks that seem to embed 
themselves forever." 
</P>
<P>
South American plants also have duplicitous hairy coverings. A few, such as the 
small fuzzy balls of the Bolivian Rebutia muscula named 'Mousy' have an 
innocuous covering that is pettable, but others, such as Cleistocactus strausii 
'Silver Touch' and its forms have insidious spines. 
</P>
<P>
Semperviviums from Europe protect themselves from summer sun and winter snow by 
a hairy vesture of their waxy leaves. From the southern part of that continent, 
the "spider web" plant, S. arachnoideum, has a showy tangle of silvery hair. 
</P>
<P>
From Africa comes the contorted stems of the rare Anacampseros albissima, 
covered with minute brilliant-white scale-like leaves. And, from Australia, 
there is A. australis. 
</P>
<P>

HOW TO WASH RESIDUES OFF PRODUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOC ABRAHAM and KATY ABRAHAM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Please tell me if washing fruits and vegetables will remove pesticide 
residues. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: If the pesticides are inside the fruit or vegetable, as happens with 
systemic types, washing or peeling will not help. For most produce, washing the 
outside with a solution made by adding a few drops of liquid detergent per pint 
of water works better than just rinsing with water. 
</P>
<P>
Some people tell us they use a bar of Ivory soap to make a light suds, since it 
doesn't have any artificial colors or perfumes that some detergents and soaps 
may have. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Hot Spots, Try Sun-Loving Periwinkle 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a dry spot next to the foundation of our house. It gets full sun and 
is hot. Is there any plant that will do well there? 
</P>
<P>
A: A good heat-loving plant that needs to be grown more is Vinca rosea or 
Catharanthus roseus (also called Madagascar periwinkle). We don't mean the 
vinca vine (Vinca minor) which is used as a ground cover and commonly called 
myrtle. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do we mean the one named Vinca major, which is used as a hanging vine in 
window boxes and hanging baskets. 
</P>
<P>
The one we refer to is an annual sold as a bedding plant, which is becoming so 
popular that plant breeders are concentrating on new varieties. It won't be 
long before this annual will be in colors resembling those of impatiens. 
</P>
<P>
At present, there are many shades of pink and white with red or pink centers. 
They bloom freely all summer and fall and can be grown indoors as houseplants 
during winter. They make superb hanging basket plants. An added bonus is that 
they are relatively pest-free, in addition to their great tolerance for hot, 
dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rotation May Help Boost Vegetable Yield 
</P>
<P>
Q: Perhaps you can help me with a puzzling problem. I have planted a vegetable 
garden each spring for the last five or six years; however now the yield is way 
down, even though the plants are lush and green. I add amendments and 
fertilizer each time I replant, so what am I doing wrong? We live in a canyon 
area where sun is scant -- a maximum of about five hours per day. 
</P>
<P>
A: The problem could be not enough sun. Perhaps the trees have grown taller 
during the last six years. Too little sun would certainly cause plants to grow 
lush, but fruit poorly. You also might try fertilizing less, since that also 
promotes leafy greens at the expense of fruit, unless you are growing leafy 
greens of course. 
</P>
<P>
You might also try crop rotation. Many plants shouldn't be grown in the same 
spot year after year. This is even true of flowers, such as delphiniums. 
Harmful soil organisms build up in the soil where the plants grow, but moving 
them leaves these organisms behind. Put the tomatoes where the lettuce was, the 
lettuce where you grew carrots before and so on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Rose Acts More Like Floribunda 
</P>
<P>
Q: "My Tiffany rose bush, now in its third spring, started acting like a 
floribunda rose, producing clusters of small roses on a long cane instead of 
producing a single large bloom on a stem. What puzzles me even more is that 
only half of the rose is doing this. The other half is behaving normally. Does 
this happen frequently with roses?" 
</P>
<P>
A: First, let's explain what a Tiffany rose is. It is classified as a hybrid 
tea with five-inch silvery pink blooms, each borne on a single stem. It has a 
rich fragrance and is mildew resistant. 
</P>
<P>
Hybrid rose bushes have two "parts" -- the top, which is the favored or 
"cultivated" section, and the bottom, known as "understock." A bud is taken 
from a Tiffany plant in the nursery, and inserted into a vigorous understock, 
which soon nurses the bud into a desirable plant. 
</P>
<P>
Certain things like a severe winter, insects, diseases or drought, etc, often 
kill the top portion or the cultivated rose, leaving the vigorous understock to 
produce its own blooms and finally take over the whole plant. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the hybrid part becomes weakened but still produces a live cane, 
while the understock sends up shoots that overshadow it. You have a floribunda 
with clusters of flowers because that is the understock which your Tiffany was 
budded onto. You can encourage the Tiffany to survive by pruning out all the 
shoots from the understock and leaving whatever shoots come up from above the 
graft union.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurseryman on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
If feeding camellias and azaleas with an acid-promoting fertilizer doesn't 
"green" them up, use an iron chelate available at your local garden center. 
</P>
<P>
Soak hanging basket plants under a sprinkler or in a tub every now and then to 
insure roots are getting thoroughly irrigated. 
</P>
<P>
Bougainvillea bloom will be intensified if you keep the plants on the dry side. 
If they're not blooming at all, chances are you're watering too much. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysanthemums bought in bloom this month can be cut back when flowering is 
finished for a second bloom in the fall.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT: STEREO SYSTEMS WITH ELBOW ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY SOMERFIELD, Somerfield is a home entertainment columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard of "desktop publishing" -- well, now there's "desktop audio." The 
move to make modern electronics smaller and smaller has spilled over into the 
home entertainment arena. Tiny desktop audio components are becoming more and 
more popular, and are being produced by an ever-increasing variety of 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
As populations grow and land in urban areas becomes increasingly costly, we are 
all striving to make more efficient use of space. Whether you live in a studio 
apartment, a college dormitory, a town house or one of the latest generations 
of compact homes, you know that every inch of space is dear. "Desktop audio" 
components are designed and built to take advantage of this need to conserve 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers refer to the new generation of tiny audio components as 
"compact" rather than "desktop." The result is the same: several pieces of 
equipment occupy a very compact area. Desktop audio gear should not be confused 
with battery-powered portable equipment or "boom boxes." Desktop gear, though 
very small, is meant to live at home. 
</P>
<P>
While the size of the new audio equipment may have shrunk, the sound produced 
by it (as well as its price tag) can still be quite large. Here are three 
systems from different makers. Each is no larger than a foot-high pile of 
telephone books. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casio Single Unit 
</P>
<P>
While the Casio MS-202 looks like a stack of four components, it's actually a 
single unit. It houses (from the top down) a turntable, an FM/AM tuner, an 
integrated amplifier with three-band graphic equalizer, and a dual-cassette 
deck. Also included are a wireless remote control and a pair of speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Though small, the system is not without bells and whistles. The full-size 
turntable is the belt-driven, semi-automatic type, and has a molded plastic 
dust cover. The tuner can be set to 12 FM and six AM stations. The cassette 
unit is capable of high-speed dubbing and can play two tapes consecutively. It 
can record from the turntable, the radio, or tape to tape. 
</P>
<P>
The MS-202 has an external input for attaching a compact disc player, 
television set, VCR or other audio source, and it has a headphone jack for 
private listening. The wireless remote controls on/off, volume, mute, and tuner 
scan. The Casio MS-202 is available now at a suggested retail price of $250. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compact Magnavox 
</P>
<P>
The model AZ8700GY (where do they come up with these numbers?) from Magnavox is 
even more compact than the Casio, and while it lacks a turntable, it does 
feature a compact disc (CD) player. 
</P>
<P>
So, included in this desktop system are a CD player, FM/AM radio, an integrated 
amplifier with a four-band graphic equalizer, and a dual-cassette deck. A pair 
of speakers comes as part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
The CD player features repeat and shuffle play modes, as well as 20-track 
programmability. The FM/AM radio has electronic tuning, 12 station presets, and 
a built-in, telescoping antenna. The dual cassette deck offers high-speed 
dubbing and auto-reverse recording and playback. A pair of small, single-driver 
speakers is part of the system, and a headphone jack is included for private 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
The Magnavox AZ8700GY, a real mighty-mite of a system, will be available in 
September with a $320 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-End Yamaha 
</P>
<P>
I think the Yamaha YST-C11 is the best sounding of the three, but is three 
times the price of the others. The YST-C11 consists of a CD player, an FM/AM 
tuner, a dual-cassette tape recorder/player, an integrated stereo amplifier 
with four-band graphic equalizer, a wireless remote control and two speakers. 
</P>
<P>
The CD-player offers direct access, random play and full programmability. The 
FM/AM tuner allows direct entry of station frequencies, as well as 10 presets. 
The tape deck has auto-reverse playback on both cassettes, as well as Dolby B 
noise reduction. The speakers are of excellent quality, each with a 4.75-inch 
mid-range and 1-inch tweeter. The wireless remote contains 34 buttons, enough 
to control every function of the YST-C11. 
</P>
<P>
The system also includes a built-in timer, so you can be awakened (or lulled to 
sleep) by your favorite radio station, CD or tape -- or even record a radio 
program while you're away. The Yamaha YST-C11 desktop audio system sells for 
$999, and is available now. 
</P>
<P>

COMMERCIAL SCENE: OFFICE BUILDINGS STEPPING UP SECURITY SERVICES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THESE DAYS, EMPLOYEES WHO WORK LATE WANT ASSURANCE THEY WON'T MEET 
STRANGERS IN THE CORRIDORS AND MAY EXPECT AN ESCORT TO THEIR CARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN, Galperin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who has 
covered the commercial real estate scene for several years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 2 a.m., and you are finally ready to leave work. 
</P>
<P>
The office feels like a cavern. The corridors are dim. The elevator seems to 
take forever. And the parking garage is barren. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's time to start shopping for new office space. 
</P>
<P>
Today, building security is a topic sure to come up in lease negotiations. 
Buildings without a comprehensive plan are increasingly shunned by businesses 
looking to relocate. Tenants are demanding more attention to their safety, and 
commercial landlords are offering a wide range of security services. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of living with fear, a simple call to the building's security station 
can summon an escort to the car. Specially programmed elevators and 
credit-card-controlled door locks help ensure that unwelcome guests don't get 
access to offices. 
</P>
<P>
And cameras watch every exit and corridor for any suspicious activities. 
</P>
<P>
All this technology also presents what a few critics consider a more ominous 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have gone so far as to install retina scanners that use an 
infrared light to "read" a person's eyes and determine if they are one of the 
people allowed to enter a particular area. 
</P>
<P>
Every move can be tracked by computer. With doors and elevators that require 
access codes or cards, it's easy for building managers and bosses to get a 
computer printout of who has been where and when. The computer tracks entrances 
and exits, elevator rides and even trips to the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the technology's implications, demand keeps growing. Last year, the 
security industry raked in somewhere between $9 billion and $17 billion. About 
60% of that was spent on commercial security systems and services, according to 
the Security Industry Assn. An estimated 1.1 million people are employed in 
private security. 
</P>
<P>
"It's playing an ever-increasing role in the leasing of properties," said 
Christopher Galante, director of public safety for Heitman Properties Ltd. in 
Beverly Hills. "Tenants are more aware of it than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Landlords are required by law to protect tenants from reasonably foreseeable 
harms. This, said William L. Rinehart, director of corporate security at 
Tishman West Cos., "has created a burden on property owners to create a secure 
environment for tenants and visitors." 
</P>
<P>
Rinehart's company manages about 30 office buildings, all of which have some 
sort of security program. 
</P>
<P>
"We deal with very sophisticated tenants, and they're very conscious of 
security and safety," he said. In fact, Rinehart added, he often sits in on 
lease negotiations so that tenants can query him on the details of how they 
would be protected if they leased in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants want to know: What systems are in place? How is access controlled? How 
do guards handle a person's walking out of a building with office equipment? 
What kind of training do the guards get? How are the security personnel 
dressed? 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to deciding on where to move, noted Rinehart, no detail is 
considered too small. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can gain access to the building with a business suit and create 
mischief," warned Aydin (Turk) Bircan, president and chief executive officer of 
ISS Security Services Inc. in downtown Los Angeles. "In the daytime, the office 
buildings are quite vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the buildings served by ISS include the recently built First Interstate 
World Center, the garment district's Cooper Building and Burbank's Fine Arts 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants seek protection from a wide range of undesirables such as disgruntled 
ex-employees, crazed clients, dishonest office workers and organized groups of 
thieves, known as "office creepers," who make their way through whole 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
There is a limit, however, to the scope of protection offered by most landlords 
and the security companies they hire. 
</P>
<P>
Most guards are instructed never to use physical force -- that's left to the 
law enforcement officers. The guards also very rarely carry guns. Arming the 
guards is too great a liability for most landlords and security companies. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said Bircan, "we don't want a shoot-out at the building." Instead, 
most guards walk their rounds unarmed and log their scheduled stops either on 
paper or with a computerized system. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hazan, vice president of operations at Trizec Properties Inc. in Encino, 
doesn't believe in guns either. 
</P>
<P>
"We would never confront an armed robber," said Hazan. The role of security is 
primarily to help protect tenants in case of a fire or earthquake. And, he 
said, "we don't want to give the impression of being a maximum security 
building." 
</P>
<P>
"You want to develop a tough reputation," noted Fred Dickey, operations manager 
for United Security Industries in Santa Monica. Still, he said, his guards do 
not use force but summon the police. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants in many of Dickey's buildings have card-key access that automatically 
keeps track of their comings and goings. Each card is programmed in such a way 
as to allow access to certain areas at certain times of the day. Employees who 
are not supposed to be at the office over the weekend, for example, are 
automatically denied access as soon as they try to use their cards. 
</P>
<P>
Some employees have also been known to arrive at work only to find they have 
been fired when their access codes to elevators and offices have been 
deactivated. It has become an increasingly popular strategy with employers who 
want to make sure a fired employee doesn't get a chance to steal anything from 
the company or tamper with computer data. Instead, fired employees make it only 
as far as a reception desk, where they find their personal belongings packed 
along with a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
As sophisticated as these systems get, though, "security can't be everywhere at 
once," said Dickey. "We expect the tenants to tell us when something suspicious 
is going on." 
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated equipment also requires sophisticated staff to manage it. Many 
guards are paid about $8 an hour and have only minimal training. It takes about 
six to eight hours to prepare for California's guard exam, reported Dickey. 
Though most security companies provide more than one day's training, the limit 
is about a week. 
</P>
<P>
Finding qualified personnel is a constant problem. "The labor market is bad," 
Dickey said. Then, too, most office towers only have a few guards. First 
Interstate World Center -- with about 60 to 70 cameras and 20 guards working 
the day shift -- is a notable exception. 
</P>
<P>
"All the monitoring systems in the world are useless unless people understand 
what to do," said Michael R. Collins, executive director of management services 
for Metropolitan Structures West Inc., the managing partner of California Plaza 
at Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We teach our people to notice if behavior is unusual," he said. "All our staff 
is part of our security system." 
</P>
<P>
'It's really more of a concierge service," conceded Collins, adding: "It's not 
been demonstrated that there's much real danger to working in an office 
building. There are perceived fears, but they're not as real as people think 
they are." Cal Plaza's six daytime and eight nighttime guards, he said, serve 
more as a deterrent than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses that occupy a whole building have long taken responsibility for 
their own security. Now, businesses in office buildings with many tenants are 
doing the same. The law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom has 65 
security people protecting its various offices, reported John Van Valkenburg, 
the firm's chief of security. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys and secretaries alike can be escorted to their cars at late hours; 
somebody watches the premises over the weekends; computer rooms are guarded, 
and computer systems are monitored to avoid penetration by hackers. 
</P>
<P>
Skadden, Arps tries to keep its security services very low-key, Van Valkenburg 
said. "We don't want a prison environment." 
</P>
<P>
Tenants -- especially lawyers -- can't be too careful these days, advised Bob 
A. Ortiz, executive vice president at Cushman Realty in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among other precautions, he advised, computer and file rooms should be designed 
and built in such a way that nobody can enter through ventilation ducts or drop 
ceilings. Companies that don't take such preventive measures to secure their 
operations, he said, may be found liable to clients who suffer as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman's clients are demanding more and more security from the buildings they 
occupy, Ortiz said. But, he said, "the best security is security you don't know 
is there." 
</P>
<P>
Only in Hollywood would 300 people show up at 8 a.m. on a Friday for the 
private movie screening of Dick Tracy courtesy of Cushman &amp; Wakefield. It 
was all part of a June 15 gimmick orchestrated by these commercial brokers to 
woo some of their clients and raise money for the West Valley Area Police 
Activity League's support of the Haven Hills battered women's shelter in Canoga 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do something different from the corporate cocktail party," said 
event organizer and Cushman &amp; Wakefield branch manager Bruce Arden. 
"They're so boring, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company entertained its prime clients and their families with a 
screening of Batman.

DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
<P>
Centerpointe La Palma Project Completed 
</P>
<P>
Birtcher of Laguna Niguel and Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York recently 
completed the $40-million third and final phase of Centerpointe La Palma -- a 
42-acre mixed-use project on the border of Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the 850,000-square-foot development are four free-standing 
restaurants, two retail complexes, seven-office/R&amp;D buildings, a 162-room 
Days Inn hotel and four office buildings ranging from three stories to seven 
stories in height. The $110-million project was started in 1985 and, according 
to Birtcher, occupies more than two-thirds of the city of La Palma's 
commercially zoned land. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers Perez Associates of Irvine announced the opening of its $25-million 
Raymond Commerce Center at a 18.7-acre site in Anaheim that once served as a 
plant for Laura Scudder potato chip operations. 
</P>
<P>
Located at 1525 N. Raymond Ave., the project's first phase includes 17 
buildings that total 235,000 square feet of office and industrial space for 
sale. A second phase is set to include another 60,000 square feet of small 
space to be sold as industrial condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
In Corona, developer Nathan J. Leanse of Beverly Hills is completing a 12-acre, 
$11.8-million light-manufacturing and distribution business park within the 
Corona Spectrum. The business park includes three buildings totaling 234,460 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SALES 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Pay Top Price for Retail Center 
</P>
<P>
Kowa Real Estate Investment Co. and Sogo Co. Ltd. have agreed to pay what's 
probably the highest price per square foot for retail space ever in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan-based companies plan to buy an approximately 90% stake in the 
soon-to-be-completed Two Rodeo Drive Project in Beverly Hills for what the 
sellers described as "well over $200 million." 
</P>
<P>
The 135,000-square-foot retail complex is to be sold in two stages by a group 
of investors that includes San Francisco developer Douglas L. Stitzel, 
Berisford International of Britain and developer Scott Malkin of New York. Kowa 
is a subsidiary of the Industrial Bank of Japan; Sogo is said to be Japan's 
biggest department store chain. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsui &amp; Co. of Japan has agreed to acquire half of Laguna Niguel-based 
developer Birtcher for more than $100 million.

NEWS AND BRIEFS: ALBANIA NOW OPEN FOR TOURIST BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY HABEGGER and JAMES O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The changes sweeping Eastern Europe have reached even isolated Albania, which 
recently lifted a ban on American travelers that had been in effect for more 
than four decades. The move is a result of Albania's desire to rejoin the 
community of nations and restore diplomatic ties with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials held talks with representatives from Albania last month, with 
Albania expressing interest in developing trade and tourism even before full 
diplomatic relations are established. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the only Americans allowed to visit this small country 
bordered by Greece, Yugoslavia and the Adriatic Sea were those of Albanian 
descent. Now, any American can travel there via group tours arranged through 
the state tourism agency, Albturist. 
</P>
<P>
European companies such as London-based Regent Holidays have been running tours 
to Albania for years, working first through friendship agencies and then 
through normal business arrangements. Many companies take tours out of Athens, 
but to date no American companies are arranging tours from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Boston-based Kutrubes Travel Agency -- (617) 426-5668 -- hopes to develop such 
tours in the near future. The only North American agency running full tours to 
Albania is Exotik Tours of Montreal. Exotik offers seven trips between now and 
November out of Toronto and Montreal, with 12- and 19-day itineraries that 
visit as many as six Albanian cities and include one night in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Costs begin at $1,350 for the 12-day tour and $1,675 for 19 days, including Air 
France flights from the Canadian cities, plus all hotels, meals, guides, 
transportation and transfers. Lead time for obtaining a group visa is a minimum 
of three weeks. For more information, contact Exotik Tours, 1117 St. Catherine 
Street West, Suite 806, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3B 1H9, (514) 284-3324. 
</P>
<P>
It is theoretically possible for individual travelers to visit Albania for a 
day by taking the ferry from Corfu. Arrangements can be made at the ferry 
terminal, although visa problems could arise. 
</P>
<P>
Albania is a rural, agricultural country of 3.3 million with few roads or 
automobiles. Understandably, the country's tourism infrastructure is not on a 
par with Western Europe, but the hotels are adequate, the food is good and 
guides are competent. 
</P>
<P>
Albturist doesn't employ any full-time guides, so most are moonlighting college 
or university professors. LARRY HABEGGER and JAMES O'REILLY

Kids' stuff: The Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla., will hold its annual 
weeklong etiquette and money management camps next month. The Etiquette Camp, 
set for July 15-21 for children ages nine to 16, includes seminars on 
introductions, the art of conversation, table manners and settings, plus 
grooming, phone manners, writing thank-you notes and ballroom dancing. The fee 
is $550 per child. In the Money Management Camp, to be held July 22-28 for 
children 12 to 15, subjects will include explanations of stocks, bonds and 
mutual funds, the 1987 stock market crash, ethics in investing and daily 
living. Each participant will make a $100 stock purchase (included in the $600 
registration fee) as part of the program. Parents are invited to the 
semi-formal graduation banquet on Friday night. The fee includes daily lunch, 
but not room, breakfast or dinner. For complete details, call (800) 833-3141.

<P>
Growing up: Tourism along Mexico's Caribbean coast has grown tenfold over the 
past 20 years, according to a government official. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism Secretary Pedro Joaquin Coldwell, speaking at a hotel industry 
conference in Cancun recently, said the region now attracts 1.3 million 
visitors annually. The area includes Cancun, Tulum, Cozumel and Isla Mujeres. 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell said visitors to this region spend 70% more per capita than the world 
average for tourism spending. Most hotel rooms in Cancun and Cozumel cost at 
least $100 U.S. per night. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Abdon Srabillon, president of the Cancun Hotel Assn., said that hotel 
owners have spent $14 million to restore the area since Hurricane Gilbert hit 
in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
More Mexico: Word is that Mexico will have unleaded gas throughout the nation 
before next October. The publication "Mexico Now" also adds that crossing the 
border in autos will be smoother in the future since the Mexican Immigration 
Department has taken over the issuing of car permits, eliminating a second stop 
at customs offices at border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Easier access: Bahrain has relaxed visa restrictions in a bid to attract more 
foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists, businessmen and relatives of residents will receive 7-day or 72-hour 
visas automatically if they have valid passports, return air tickets, are not 
seeking employment and do not pose a threat to the security, public order or 
national interest of Bahrain, according to a government publication. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials said the new rules were aimed mainly at foreigners in the 
nearby gulf states of Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab 
Emirates.

TOURING THE EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE BY FOOT OFFERS MEMORABLE IMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You may not cover much ground when you tour Europe by foot, but there's no 
better way to get a wonderfully intimate look at the countryside. When you have 
laboriously climbed the twisting path of a long hill, its image is burned into 
memory: every rock you stumbled over, every flower you stopped to sniff. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, my wife and I signed up with a tour company for what turned out 
to be an exceptional adventure in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
For nine days we hiked the gorgeous hills and valleys of southern Tuscany, 
arriving at the end of each day's journey at a comfortable inn, in a small and 
historic hilltop village. 
</P>
<P>
We had so much fun that we took another walking tour the following year, a 
15-day ramble through the famed Loire Valley of France. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as six years ago, such escorted walking tours of Europe -- or 
anywhere else, for that matter -- were something of a novelty, and only a 
relatively few tour organizers offered them. Since then, however, exploring 
Europe by foot seems to have captured the imagination of athletic-minded 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of tour companies have put together walking excursions throughout 
Europe, including Eastern Europe. Some of them are bicycling companies that 
have added walking tours for clients who want to linger along the way. 
</P>
<P>
The surge of interest in walking tours prompted one Boulder, Colo., travel 
agency, All Adventure Travel, to begin specializing this year in nothing but 
escorted bicycling and walking tours. 
</P>
<P>
The owners, Pat and Julio Halty, are bicyclists themselves, but they discovered 
a lot of their customers preferred to travel afoot. The firm currently serves 
as a clearinghouse, or reservation service, for about 25 walking-tour 
companies, and the number is growing. 
</P>
<P>
The price for a European walking holiday can cost $60 or $75 per person per day 
to as much as $300. The price varies for several reasons, says Pat Halty, the 
primary factor being type of accommodations offered. 
</P>
<P>
Some tours are all-inclusive -- you pay one price and it covers all meals, wine 
and museum entrance fees. Other companies provide breakfast only, and you dine 
wherever you choose -- at an additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
The country in which you are walking also is a consideration in the price. 
Greece, Portugal and Spain are inexpensive. In France's Loire Valley and the 
wine country of Italy, you can expect to pay much more. 
</P>
<P>
A more subtle distinction is the ratio between guides and participants. "We 
like an 8-to-1 ratio," says Halty. "I get concerned when it's 15 to 1. It 
becomes a mob scene." 
</P>
<P>
Among the many travel companies offering escorted walks in Europe this summer: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alternative Travel Group: One of the oldest of the walking tour companies, 
Alternative Travel Group, began by specializing in Italian jaunts and then 
expanded to include tours in France, Portugal, Spain, the Alps and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Its colorful 30-page catalogue lists about 20 itineraries, lasting from nine to 
11 days, and dozens of departures from spring into winter. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's prices tend to be on the high side, compared to other companies, but 
almost everything is included in the cost except air fare. The local wine flows 
as freely as you might wish at lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the firm's most popular hikes are the "Tuscan Trail" and the "Southern 
Tuscan Trail." Guides escort you over country lanes and hilltop trails away 
from highway traffic. A vehicle shuttles your luggage to the next hilltop 
village. 
</P>
<P>
One night in southern Tuscany is spent at a historic hot springs spa, Bagno 
Vignoni, where you soak your muscles and drink in a splendid view. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-day Tuscan Trail tour is $1,745; the 11-day Southern Tuscan Trail tour 
is $1,975. Air fare to Pisa is additional. There are frequent departures 
through October. 
</P>
<P>

OX1 2AZ, (800) 527-5997. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Butterfield &amp; Robinson: This Canadian firm began offering bicycle tours 
24 years ago, and since then has added a small selection of walking tours. 
Theirs are, however, among the fanciest -- and most expensive -- walking tours 
on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations are in chateaux, villas and small-town auberges and country 
inns. The company offers five- to nine-day walks in the Alsace, Bordeaux and 
Dordogne Valley regions of France; the Swiss Alps, and the Lake Country, 
Chianti and Tuscany regions of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
With Alternative Travel, you walk with one or more guides. Butterfield &amp; 
Robinson offers a variation. You can choose to accompany a guide, but the firm 
also distributes maps of each tour segment so that you can find your own way to 
the next destination. 
</P>
<P>
A van carries the luggage. The firm generally plans two-night stops in each 
destination; many companies stay in a different town each evening. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-day Alsace itinerary links what the firm describes as "the tiny 
half-timbered, flower-bedecked villages for which Alsace is famous." Cost is 
$2,295 per person, excluding air fare to Strasbourg. Departures are June 9, 
July 14, Aug. 18, Sept. 1 and Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>

Toronto, Canada M5B 1X3, (800) 387-1147 and (416) 864-1354. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Wayfarers: This English walking company devotes its energies to the 
homeland, offering a series of six-night tours along country lanes and ancient 
right-of-ways. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the tours have a literary flavor, among them "Sir Walter Scott's 
Borders," "Thomas Hardy's Dorset" and "James Herriot's Yorkshire." Also very 
popular are walks in England's Cotswolds, which tend to sell out quickly. 
</P>
<P>
On these trips, a guide leads the way, a van carries the luggage and you stay 
in small inns and country hotels. 
</P>
<P>
On the Thomas Hardy tour, you pass through picturesque villages and the gently 
rolling hills of Wessex in southwestern England. The price for this and all 
other tours is about $1,100. Departures for the Thomas Hardy tour are Aug. 5 
and Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>

Newport, R.I. 02840, (401) 849-5087. 
</P>
<P>
 -- American Youth Hostels: In this year's tour catalogue, American Youth 
Hostels offers three all-inclusive hikes: to Ireland, the Swiss Alps and the 
French and Italian Alps. Each lasts 16 days. Stays are in inexpensive dorm 
accommodations in hostels, which keeps the price down. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's "Shamrock Shuffle," a circle tour out of Dublin, costs 
$2,350 per person, including round-trip air fare from New York City. A guide 
leads the way. 
</P>
<P>
You must take a backpack and carry your belongings. There is one departure for 
adults age 18 or over on Aug. 17; a second departure open to younger hikers is 
scheduled for July 27. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 -- Worldwide Walking: Long a specialist in winter cross-country skiing tours, 
this New Jersey firm recently has introduced a series of walking tours to such 
unusual destinations as the Tatra Mountain region on the Polish-Czechoslovak 
border, several mountain regions in Norway and to Lapland in northern Finland. 
</P>
<P>
The Tatra Mountain trips are aimed at more adventurous travelers since several 
nights are spent in bunk rooms in mountain lodges. 
</P>
<P>
While in the mountains, you carry your gear in a backpack. Distances are not 
great. In Finland you stay in Lapp houses or tents. In Norway, accommodations 
are in comfortable inns. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-day, two-country Tatra Mountain tour begins in Krakow, Poland, and ends 
in Prague. In both cities, accommodations are in first-class hotels. The price 
is $1,090 per person, including lodging and meals but not air fare. Departures 
are July 15, Aug. 12 and Sept. 2.

 -- The French Experience: This New York City travel agency is introducing an 
unusual walking holiday in Provence. 
</P>
<P>
Participants stay for a week in a small hotel in the ancient village of 
Moustiers Sainte Marie in Provence, about 60 miles north of Nice. Each day you 
can join an escorted hike, either in the spectacularly scenic Gorge du Verdon 
-- a deep river canyon -- or to mountain villages or through the Provence 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
A different hike is scheduled every day of the week and they are available from 
June through October. 
</P>
<P>
You can begin the week's cycle any day of the week. Picnic lunches are provided 
along the way. Swimming and windsurfing are available in nearby lakes. The 
price of $918 per person, based on double occupancy, includes lodging for six 
nights, all meals, six hikes and transfers from Nice. 
</P>
<P>
For information: The French Experience, 370 Lexington Ave., New York 10017,

</P>
<P>
 -- Distant Journeys: The two Outward Bound instructors who head this firm, 
Andrea Ellison and Julie Head, concentrate on alpine excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Their basic trip is the classic "Tour du Mont Blanc," a 13-day circle route 
that begins in Chamonix, France, crosses into the Italian and Swiss Alps and 
returns to its starting point. 
</P>
<P>
The scenery is gorgeous, says Ellison, but you can expect moderate-to-strenuous 
hiking at higher altitudes (though under 9,000 feet). Accommodations are in 
modest hotels or in mountain lodges or refuges. 
</P>
<P>
You will have to carry a backpack with clothing changes and rain gear. The 
price is $1,250 per person, which includes lodging and most meals; air fare to 
Geneva is extra. 
</P>
<P>
Departures are June 25, Aug. 27 and Sept. 10. There are seven-day versions of 
the trip at $925 per person.

<P>
 -- Above the Clouds Trekking: Among the few Americans who find their way to 
Romania's Transylvania Alps are the small groups that have been led there by 
this Worcester, Mass., firm since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
These 16-day trips are not for everyone, since Romania's mountain lodges are 
very basic, according to the firm's Steve Conlon. However, the scenery is 
beautiful, and you have the opportunity to meet and talk with hikers from other 
Eastern European countries. 
</P>

ADVENTURE TRAVEL: ISOLATED CAPE VERDE ISLANDS RIPE WITH DRAMA AND SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PRAIA, Cape Verde 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cape Verde Islands, 400 miles off the coast of Senegal in the Atlantic 
Ocean, are no tropical paradise. They are obscure, isolated and full of 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
The surprises included tropical valleys, miles of beaches, pockets of 
Portuguese colonial architecture, discos next to churches, turtles laying eggs 
on deserted volcanic shores, Afro-Portuguese cuisine and an amiable population. 
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde's terrain is mostly volcanic and barren. And, unless you consider 
four pages of State Department statistics to be a guidebook, there's not much 
literature available. In fact, few of your acquaintances are likely to have 
even heard of Cape Verde. 
</P>
<P>
Droughts and famines -- some of the archipelago's water supply is brought in by 
ship -- coupled with the earlier historic decline in the slave trade based here 
has, over the centuries, brought the islands into their present position as one 
of the poorest nations on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In its capital city, Praia, streets are strewn with garbage and the buildings 
are decaying. The best hotel is none too good -- with drains that don't, hot 
water that isn't and overripe bananas for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
So after arriving in the capital, on the island of Sao Tiago, take one of the 
inter-island flights from Praia to the northern islands, where the drama, the 
beauty and the unexpected are to be found. 
</P>
<P>
The island of Sao Vicente boasts the country's most important port, Mindelo, 
and quite a few Portuguese colonial buildings. Some of that architectural style 
originates from 1462, when Portuguese settlers first arrived, followed by the 
slave traders. 
</P>
<P>
Mindelo itself has long served as a Navy fueling and rest haven, and in the 
early 1800s it was the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Squadron. 
</P>
<P>
The city is certainly the most attractive in the country, with two hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The Aparthotel, offers rooms at $25, double occupancy, with a view of the port. 
Although the hotel has a minimum of charm, it does have that loveliest of 
modern devices -- air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
More charming is the Hotel Porto Grande at $22 a room, double occupancy, across 
the street from the city's plaza, Praca Amilcar Cabral. At the Porto Grande, 
rooms only have fans. However, guests can comfortably adjourn to the terrace 
and enjoy the evening's breeze and the plaza's action. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly on Sunday evening, it seems the whole town gathers in its finery, 
the band booms forth from the raised bandstand, and everyone from youths to 
grandmothers is dancing among the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
If you want entertainment in Cape Verde, of any variety at all, better get it 
in Mindelo, because from here on you're off to the outer islands. 
</P>
<P>
I wandered up the hill to the "Frenchman's" restaurant; it seemed to be known 
by no other name. But here I cooled off in a tropical garden and ate fresh 
local fish sauteed in a tasty sauce -- while the Frenchman himself nodded and 
smiled from behind the bar, apparently unable to talk. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been in the islands for 12 years," the waitress told me. "He talks, but 
it's too hot for him to talk tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman's menu, fish and chicken, is typical of Cape Verde's limited 
cuisine. There is beef and sometimes chicken or pork, and nearly always fish, 
along with rice and excellent French-fried potatoes, reminiscent of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Although every restaurant in the islands has lobster on the menu, and sometimes 
shrimp, it seems I'd done it again -- arrived when the country's principal 
delicacies were out of season, which is from from January to June. 
</P>
<P>
The beverage situation isn't much different, but a little more amusing. Signs 
are everywhere for Beck's beer, Breda or other imports. 
</P>
<P>
But contrary to the signs, there is only one kind of beer available in Cape 
Verde -- Ceris. It's not bad and it is everywhere. Of course, there are always 
the crisp, white vinho verde wines imported from Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
In Mindelo, I also ate chow mein at Restaurant China, and discovered cachupa -- 
the national dish (a sort of hominy-based stew with sausages, ribs and 
potatoes). 
</P>
<P>
I found my first cachupa by being directed into an alley and then to a doorway 
where a woman was engaged in a violent verbal exchange with a group of 
businessmen who had just sent their fish back to the kitchen. The locals refer 
to this hidden spot as Tchaina. 
</P>
<P>
A third choice would be on the edge of town at Chez Loutcha, which describes 
itself as Euro-Africana, and dishes out such delicacies as an African egg roll, 
sea snails and chicken Senegal-style, together with the traditional Portuguese 
codfish. 
</P>
<P>
A little night life? Try a couple of discos, Chez Ami and, more centrally 
located, Pimms. As usual in Cape Verde, there's no sign in front. You've just 
got to ask around, then work your way uphill until you hear the music and spot 
a giant bouncer sitting outside a door taking money. 
</P>
<P>
I had a hard time discoing in that heat, but the humidity doesn't keep Pimms 
from being jammed until late each evening. 
</P>
<P>
If it's a Sunday night, less than a block away is the Church of the Nazarene, 
with its evangelical shouting and music. 
</P>
<P>
Late one morning, after wandering through Mindelo's colorful fish and produce 
markets, I climbed aboard the small freighter-ferry, the Porto Novo, to cross 
($3.60) the channel to Santo Antao. 
</P>
<P>
When I stepped down to the small dock at Santo Antao, duffel bag over my 
shoulder, I knew where I wanted to go, but not how to get there. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a little questioning. It turned out there are common-carrier pickups 
to take one across the island to Ribeira Grande, or you can go by bus. I chose 
bus for one of the most dramatic rides of my life. 
</P>
<P>
My maps had shown that the route led across a high range of volcanic ridges. I 
figured there was a pass through the range. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But I sat in the windshield seat next to Silverio, the driver, my feet up on 
the dashboard, a bottle of the local version of orange Crush in my hand, 
enjoying the terrain as we whizzed our way up the narrow, lava rock road, up 
and up around the hairpin turns on a road wide enough for a bus or a truck -- 
but not for both. 
</P>
<P>
This two hours ($1.50 fare) took us up, away from the sea into pine trees and 
soft green grass. 
</P>
<P>
We paused occasionally to pick someone up, to hoist their gear to the top of 
the bus, to let someone off at a community of perhaps three or four huts, to 
pass out the window the large cake that had been handed to our driver before we 
left the dock. 
</P>
<P>
At the summit, some 4,300 feet up, almost miraculously Cape Verde changed. Now, 
for the first time in several days, I was cool, with fog below and greenery in 
several directions. 
</P>
<P>
Far below was a fertile valley in which corn flourished, and we headed down, 
plunging along narrow ridges just wide enough for us to pass. We honked loudly 
as we approached each turn, and I was grateful for the fog because, when it 
occasionally cleared, I saw that on each side was a sheer drop of 2,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
And then, horn blasting away, we wove our way into Ribeira Grande, the jump-off 
spot for the small, hidden Paul Valley, my destination. 
</P>
<P>
I heard that Paul Valley was an Atlantic Ocean version of Herman Melville's 
hidden Valley of Typee, which Melville wrote about in "Typee: a Peep at 
Polynesian Life," and which I wanted to see. 
</P>
<P>
In Ribeira Grande I hired a pickup and a young driver ($12.50) and we set off 
up a narrow highway, winding along the lava cliffs high above the heavy surf to 
the mouth of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
In view of the lack of vegetation throughout much of the island chain, this 
long, narrow piece of moist greenery is a surprising, welcome oasis. Down from 
the mountains runs a spring-fed stream that nourishes flourishing breadfruit, 
mangoes, papayas, sugar cane, bananas, orchids and ginger. 
</P>
<P>
Up the valley we went, through small villages, into the riverbed itself, past 
swimming holes filled with local kids, up to a distillery where, out of the 
local cane, aguardiente is made several months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Aguardiente might best be described as a cross between grappa and brandy. It 
costs about 18 cents a slug and, standing at the counter at the tiny 
Mercendaria Valez, it went down with force. 
</P>
<P>
There's no place to stay for the traveler in the Paul Valley. So, making our 
way back down past the rock-walled, thatched-roof huts, we went back to Ribeira 
Grande, where the one hotel, the Residencial Alianca ($15) has passable 
accommodations, a restaurant and a nice sea breeze. It must have been richer 
here centuries ago, because Sir Francis Drake plundered the town in 1585. 
</P>
<P>
After Santo Antao, I found one other island that made Cape Verde memorable. I 
got there by air on a 20-seat Twinotter from Santo Antao, although you can also 
go by inter-island freighter (most inter-island air fares run from $15-$35). 
</P>
<P>
Coming into the island of Sao Nicolau, it is obvious, especially from the air, 
that this is perhaps the most attractive of the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Its main town, Ribeira Brava, is set inland in a valley. It's no cooler in the 
Sao Nicolau valleys than elsewhere in the Cape Verde Islands, but the island is 
much greener. 
</P>
<P>
To explore it, I hired a taxi ($25), for a daylong ride down its dramatic 
coastline, and then up into the highlands where, as they do throughout the 
islands, the women carry their burdens atop their heads as they walk alongside 
the road. Divided by rock walls, corn, beans and sugar cane grow in fields. The 
hillsides are terraced, the fog is frequent, the air fresh and moist. 
</P>
<P>
From Sao Nicolau's highlands, my taxi dropped us into the hot, humid climate of 
the coast to drive along gorgeous black beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The driver stopped and I jumped out of my clothes and headed for the warm, 
refreshing water and gentle surf. That hour or so -- on a deserted black-sand 
beach with the sharp-edged peaks towering overhead -- was one of Cape Verde's 
pleasantest moments. 
</P>
<P>
Coming out of the water, I noticed a sort of trail also headed out of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
It was a moment or two before I realized that this was the path that a sea 
turtle had made the night before, coming ashore to lay her eggs then returning 
to the sea. Those eggs might have been tasty, but I had no desire to disturb 
their resting place.

TRIP OF THE WEEK: OLD HOMES STILL HOUSE CITY HISTORY 
</P>

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Horatio Gates Trussell, it was love at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
After making the long and lonely Boston-California run via Cape Horn, the sea 
captain from Maine was strolling along the beach in Santa Barbara when he saw a 
young girl, Ramona Burke. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old seaman waited until Ramona reached her 16th birthday in 1851, 
then they were married at Mission Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
He built his bride a home, using adobe brick and timbers salvaged from the 
side-wheeler Winfield Scott, which went aground on Anacapa Island. 
</P>
<P>
The Trussells' 135-year-old house still stands and has been designated a 
California Historical Landmark. Also, it is one of only two vintage homes in 
Santa Barbara that have been restored and opened to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The other is next door, a fancier place built in 1862, and known as the Fernald 
House. The multigabled mansion was moved from its original site after the last 
surviving child of Judge and Mrs. Charles Fernald died at the age of 92. 
</P>
<P>
Both properties were bequeathed to the Santa Barbara Historical Society. 
Members have restored the original and other period furnishings so visitors can 
see what family life was like in early Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The homes are behind a white picket fence at 412 and 414 W. Montecito St. The 
adobe is shaded by enormous cork oak trees, reportedly offshoots of acorns 
Capt. Trussell brought on a voyage from the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The home's architecture reflects the owner's down-east roots. Its shingled roof 
and clapboard siding are more representative of New England than Southern 
California, but the thickness of the door jambs reveals typical adobe brick 
construction behind the facade. The floorboards are from the wreck of the 
coastal steamer. 
</P>
<P>
Among the furnishings are Trussell's sea chest and a music box. Visitors also 
can see medical books and a doctor's diploma that belonged to later owners of 
the house, which is officially called the Trussell-Winchester Adobe. 
</P>
<P>
The second name refers to the family of Sara Winchester, a local schoolteacher 
who lived in the home after her parents bought it in 1882. Her brother was a 
physician who built the adjoining carriage house, where he lived after 
divorcing his wife because of her "verbal abuse." 
</P>
<P>
True love between husband and wife is more evident in the ornate house behind 
the adobe. In the vestibule is a stained-glass window that was a present from 
Judge Fernald to his wife on their first wedding anniversary in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
The mix of Gothic Revival, Eastlake and Queen Anne styles is traced to a 
remodeling of the Fernald House to 14 rooms to accommodate the family's four 
children. A local cabinetmaker crafted the redwood staircase, wainscoting and 
other decorations. 
</P>
<P>
Furniture, paintings, clothes, clocks, books and even a diary are among the 
original family possessions still in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors also can see the piano of one of the children, Florence, who later 
taught music at home. Photos from the family album are displayed in the 
hallway. 
</P>
<P>
Guests are welcome on Sundays from 2 to 4 p.m., when docents give half-hour 
guided tours at each home. A donation is requested. 
</P>
<P>
While in the neighborhood, you can investigate bygone types of transportation 
in the Old Spanish Days Carriage Museum. It's a block away at 129 Castillo St. 
on the northwest end of Pershing Park. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can wander among an unusual collection of 75 carriages, coaches, carts 
and wagons. 
</P>
<P>
During Santa Barbara's annual Old Spanish Days Fiesta in August, horses will be 
hitched up to a dozen or so of the carriages that will appear in the fiesta 
parade. Otherwise, the public can only view the historical vehicles at the 
museum on Sundays from 2 to 4 p.m. Admission is free but donations are 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Near the entrance is a hand-carved and brightly painted ceremonial wine cart 
from Sicily. The 17th-Century cart was used by guests at Hearst Castle at San 
Simeon. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby is a handsome black buggy that cost $31.85 when it was built in the 
early 1900s. For $15 more, it could be equipped with rubber tires. You'll see 
black surreys and hansom cabs, too. 
</P>
<P>
Look for one of the largest public coaches in California, an 18-passenger 
"mud-wagon" vehicle without windows or doors that ran from San Luis Obispo to 
Ventura. Its last trip was over the San Marcos Pass in 1902. 
</P>
<P>
Also on display are pioneer Conestoga wagons, early Army wagons, U.S. mail 
stages and a century-old police paddy wagon. An eye-catcher is the 1884 fire 
engine from Hyde Park, N.Y., that saw service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Take in the mid-1800s funeral wagon, which is complete with coffins, a 
Studebaker surrey made of wicker and the red-and-yellow circus wagon. Many of 
the vehicles have no identifying signs, but visitors can ask the museum's 
docents for information. 
</P>
<P>
Also on display are dozens of beautiful saddles, bridles and tack, including an 
all-silver saddle with gold embroidery that belonged to Will Rogers. Two of the 
fancy saddles were owned by Duncan Renaldo and Leo Carrillo, known to fans of 
early Western movies as the Cisco Kid and his sidekick Pancho. 
</P>
<P>
Drive from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara on U.S. 101 to see the historic 
carriages and homes. To avoid the freeway construction in Santa Barbara, take 
the left-hand exit at the edge of town to California 225/Cabrillo Boulevard. 
Drive along the coast and harbor and turn right on Castillo Street (still 
California 225). 
</P>
<P>
At the top of Pershing Park, look for the left-hand entrance drive to the Old 
Spanish Days Carriage Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, continue on Castillo Street to Montecito Street, turn left, then 
turn right almost immediately into the rear parking area for the 
Trussell-Winchester Adobe and Fernald House. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara is 215 miles.

CRIME: IT PAYS TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE AND STAY ALERT WHEN YOU TRAVEL. 
PICKPOCKETS AND OTHER THIEVES THRIVE ON DISTRACTING THEIR VICTIMS IN BUSY 
PLACES.

<P>
Extraction follows distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Remember those words and you might save yourself a lot of grief at crowded 
travel sites such as airports, sightseeing attractions, hotel lobbies and 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves around the world are using a variety of "distraction-extraction" 
techniques to make off with travelers' suitcases, briefcases, wallets, purses 
and other possessions. Often disarmingly simple, these techniques are still 
quite effective. 
</P>
<P>
"Thieves take advantage of existing confusion or create their own confusion," 
said Capt. Bernard Wilson of the Los Angeles Airport Police. "When your 
attention is diverted, they make off with your items." 
</P>
<P>
One example is when someone drops coins on the floor. While people watch the 
coins roll, stop them with their feet or even bend down to pick them up, a 
thief is busy separating the victim from the desired items. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, someone can purposefully let a suitcase flop open, then quickly 
feign a flustered look and start gathering up the items. Helping someone pick 
things up can prove costly for the good Samaritan, who is victimized during his 
good deed. 
</P>
<P>
Another dodge is to drop a $1 or $5 bill, or a pen, on the floor and ask 
someone if it belongs to them. While the person is responding, he or she may be 
victimized. 
</P>
<P>
Spilling something on a traveler, such as soda or coffee, is another popular 
technique of thieves. While you're cleaning up -- and the person who did the 
spilling even attempts to help out -- someone else is removing your goods. 
</P>
<P>
Being asked directions sounds innocuous enough, but it can be a way to draw 
attention. The same holds true when someone asks to borrow a pen or asks for 
change for a dollar. Being bumped is frequently a means to separate you from 
your wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Watching people argue, or engage in related commotions, also can be diverting. 
But the "disturbance" can easily be staged, and the thieves are at work while 
you're taking in the "performance." 
</P>
<P>
In each scenario, the traveler runs the risk of being ripped off while they're 
reacting to the situation. You can be particularly vulnerable any time you have 
to put things down -- such as briefcases and carry-on bags -- or while making 
phone calls, eating, drinking or checking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Glancing at magazines and other reading material in airport gift shops can pose 
a problem, if you put your bags on the floor while you read. Your possessions 
are out of your grip, and you've provided your own distraction. The longer you 
read, the greater the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"The more things you have to watch, and the more things you have to take care 
of, the more vulnerable you are," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Try to travel with less items, and get into the airport's secure area as soon 
as you can. There's less chance of a problem after you pass through screening." 
</P>
<P>
Thieves -- particularly those that work airports and terminals -- act in 
groups. One thief takes the item, then passes it to a second person, who may 
slip it into a shopping bag, coat, newspaper or their own larger briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
One good rule to help counteract thieves is to never leave your items 
unattended, even for a brief moment. The longer something is left unwatched or 
out of sight, the stronger the chances are of it disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
To protect yourself against pickpockets, put your wallet or billfold in an 
inside coat or side trouser pocket, not in rear pockets (called the "sucker 
pocket" by thieves). Even when buttoned, rear pockets are a bad place to keep 
wallets. You're much more likely to feel a pickpocket attempt when your wallet 
is in a front pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Placing rubber bands around a wallet can create the feeling of friction if 
someone tries to slip it out of your pocket. Just putting your wallet in a coat 
or suit jacket may not be good enough, especially if you don't regularly carry 
your wallet there. 
</P>
<P>
"You may not be sensitive to the sensation of less weight when it's slipped out 
by a pickpocket," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure that pocketbooks are always kept shut. Women should make sure that 
they put wallets all the way back into their bags after making a purchase 
instead of leaving them at the top. Put the straps of the bags around your 
hands, and keep both bags and pocketbooks tucked close to your body. 
</P>
<P>
Women should also consider carrying money in secure pockets in their clothing 
rather than in bags and purses. Velcro pieces and zippers can be sewn into 
garments. 
</P>
<P>
Any time you're jostled or bumped, immediately turn quickly to break possible 
contact with a pickpocket, then check to see if you've lost anything. If you 
are the victim of a pickpocket and know who did it, call out quickly for help. 
</P>
<P>
"Yell out what's being stolen and identify it as much as possible, such as: 'He 
took my red suitcase or my blue purse,' " Wilson advised. "This makes it easier 
to spot a stolen item." 
</P>
<P>
Try to keep an eye on the suspected pickpocket until you can get the attention 
of the airport police or other security personnel. Avoid direct confrontation, 
and remember that the thieves often pass items to accomplices, which can make 
apprehension and regaining your possessions difficult. 
</P>
<P>
When using an airport cart designed to be pulled behind you rather than pushed 
in front of you, secure smaller items by putting them under larger units or 
connecting them to bigger pieces. 
</P>
<P>
If you do have many pieces to be concerned about, consider the use of a 
cable-bicycle lock. "Locking various items together means a thief has to take 
everything," Wilson said. "The lock also tells thieves that you're alert to the 
danger of being robbed." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, following three basic rules of security provides the most effective 
defense against travel misadventures of this type: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Know your adversary. This means realizing that thieves are likely to be 
found in any crowded and hectic area, that they often work in groups, and that 
you are pitted against professionals who know how to distract and quickly rob 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep a low profile. Thieves select victims who look like they have 
something worth taking and who appear vulnerable. Don't present yourself as a 
suitable target by wearing expensive clothing and accessories, toting 
pricey-looking briefcases and baggage, and flaunting a good deal of cash or 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Try to minimize the amount of cash and credit cards you take on a trip. 
Carrying traveler's checks, which can be replaced if stolen or lost, instead of 
cash is also a good idea. When more than one adult is traveling together, split 
the money -- both cash and credit cards -- and other items of value between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stay alert, which isn't always easy when you're concerned about making your 
plane, you're tired after a long flight, or you're engrossed with any of the 
many details of traveling. Thieves, of course, thrive on the vulnerability such 
situations create.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: EUROPEAN TRAINS OFFER A RANGE OF GOOD DEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mature travelers planning to take advantage of Europe's excellent rail service 
on a vacation face the same basic decisions as other age groups. 
</P>
<P>
Eurailpass, the fine, old workhorse for trainaholics has been serving thousands 
of visitors to Western Europe for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Still going strong in 1990, additions and refinements have kept it the basic 
money- and time-saving tool for vacationers planning extensive travel within 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There is no senior discount on any Eurailpass. The reason, as one senior 
representative said: "We cannot discount an already-discounted fare." 
</P>
<P>
(BritRail, independent of Eurailpass, offers a senior discount of about 15% for 
people 60 years and over for travel within England, Scotland and Wales.) 
</P>
<P>
At present, Eurailpass offers unlimited first-class travel in 17 countries 
(with the exception of Great Britain). Greece is joined to the rail system 
through free ferry service from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
With a united Germany, East Germany will be in the system soon. And with the 
completion of the cross-channel tunnel, Great Britain may join as well. 
</P>
<P>
Until that time, Britrail has its own 5-, 15-, 22- or 30-day pass (with a 
senior discount) and offers, with the French, a five- or 10-day BritFrance 
Railpass. This one has no senior discount. 
</P>
<P>
The basic Eurailpass is available in five time periods; 15 or 21 days, and one, 
two or three months. These cost from $340 for 15 days to $930 for three months. 
All offer unlimited first-class rail travel, plus numerous ferry trips and 
other extras. 
</P>
<P>
It will only take a few minutes for a travel agent who knows your itinerary and 
travel style to determine which, if any, of the time periods is best for your 
trip. Or you can get a good train-travel guide and check your itinerary with 
rail routes and rates. 
</P>
<P>
A few sample first-class fares in Europe are: Amsterdam-Frankfurt, $90; 
Frankfurt-Vienna, $135; Vienna-Zurich, $139; Zurich-Rome, $127; Rome-Nice, $90; 
Nice-Barcelona, $102, and Barcelona-Paris, $151. That's a total $834, without 
even getting into side trips and excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Eurailpass offers a Flexipass ticket with first-class rail. The Flexipass 
allows any five days unlimited first-class travel within a 15-day period for 
$198; nine days within a 21-day period for $360, or 14-days within a month for 
$458. 
</P>
<P>
As the name implies, it's more flexible. For example, you might arrive in 
Paris, stay a few days, then use one of the travel days to go to Frankfurt for 
another several days. Then you might take trains to your next destinations, 
staying for several days each time without fretting you are wasting 
travel-train days. 
</P>
<P>
For those not planning a wide-ranging tour, all European countries offer local 
versions of the Eurailpass. Most have a Flexipass (or something like it) as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
These are good within individual countries only for five- to 30-day periods. 
Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg combine under a Benelux Tourrail Pass. Denmark, 
Norway, Sweden and Finland unite with a Scanrail Pass. None of these offer a 
senior discount. 
</P>
<P>
So where are they? 
</P>
<P>
There are many senior discounts among the Western European rail systems, from 
25% to 50% off regular fares. But almost all have restrictions that limit them 
to the average mature traveler touring Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Although these senior discounts were started for permanent residents of the 
country issuing the pass, they are now available for tourists (each country 
will ask for proof of age). Mature traveler's must buy a year's pass valid only 
in the country in which they are issued and they are not applicable to 
multicountry itineraries. 
</P>
<P>
Senior (60 years and over) discount passes for one year are inexpensive in 
Spain and Portugal, but go to a high of $68 for discount travel on any day in 
West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In Scandinavia, senior discounts start at age 65, except Norway, where it's 67. 
In most other countries, the starting age for women is either 60 or 62 and 65 
for men. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular and best known is the French Carte Vermeil, commonly 
known as the "Green Card," which is offered to anyone age 60 and older. 
</P>
<P>
Its conditions are typical of other nation's fares. Available for one year 
(purchased only in France), it costs about $23 and provides about a 50% 
discount off first- or second-class travel -- but only for travel from noon on 
Monday to 3 p.m. Friday and noon on Saturday to 3 p.m. Sunday. The discount is 
not always available on holidays. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's Senioren Pass also starts at age 60 and costs $47 for a year's 
travel within similar time periods. But for $68 a year, there are no time 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has a Senior Half-Fare Card for about $55 a year for women over 62 
and men 65 or over. It probably works out well if you plan to stay a month or 
so. It also offers about 10% discounts on hotel stays for part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
For shorter stays, the regular Eurail-style Swiss Pass or Swiss Flexipass 
offered at any age is the better deal. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a one-month Swiss Card for $80 that provides half-fare on trains, 
including private mountain rail lines, plus postal motor coaches and lake 
steamers. This is the best bet for those staying at least several weeks and 
planning extensive sightseeing excursions. 
</P>
<P>
It would be best to leave the yearlong pass discounts to the European seniors, 
unless you plan to stay at least a month or more in one country.

SIGHTSEE BY BUS AT YOUR LEISURE IN COPENHAGEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually when travelers arrive in a foreign city, one of the first orders of 
business is to sign up for the nearest sightseeing tour. 
</P>
<P>
But commercial bus tours have many disadvantages. Not only are they often very 
expensive, but on a scheduled sightseeing tour, there is no flexibility. 
Instead, you're on a strict timetable. 
</P>
<P>
One might want to stay to gaze a bit longer at a world-famous painting, or 
remain in a botanical garden for a few extra minutes amid the blossoms. Maybe 
it's just not possible to "do" a museum in half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Generally it's "On the bus, off the bus. Snap some pictures and away we go. 
Fifteen minutes. Don't be late. We have a lot more to see." 
</P>
<P>
And much of the so-called sightseeing is through a bus window at 30 m.p.h. "On 
the right you see beautiful old houses . . . on your left is a statue of King . 
. . in a minute we will come to the Olympic stadium where the games were played 
in . . . " 
</P>
<P>
There's an alternative here that doesn't have all of those drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists to this Danish capital can sightsee, but at their own pace. And it's 
much, much cheaper, leaving money over to buy statues of the Little Mermaid or 
a set of Royal Copenhagen vases. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Copenhagen operates buses -- the same kind used by residents -- for 
sightseers. Starting at the city hall (stop No. 1) the buses make continuous 
loops of the city. 
</P>
<P>
There are nine additional stops at which tourists can jump off and hop back on 
the buses. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers are very courteous and especially aware that their passengers are 
unfamiliar with their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The stop-off points are at the city's most interesting and popular attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Jump off at the world-famous Tivoli Gardens (stop No. 2), with its amusement 
rides and restaurants. A visit there might take a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Check your watch. Another bus always will come by in exactly 30 minutes. Other 
stops include the Amalienborg Palace (stop No. 5), where the royal family has 
resided since 1794 and the beautiful Amalievhaven Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Another attraction at this stop, just a short walk away, is Den Lille Havfrue, 
the famed Statue of the Little Mermaid. Copenhagan has a statue on every block. 
The Little Mermaid is Denmark's most well-known one. 
</P>
<P>
Other stops include the Danish Resistance Museum illustrating Denmark's fight 
for freedom between 1940 and 1945 (stop No. 7). 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenborg Castle (stop No. 9), one of Copenhagen's most beautiful castles 
and located in King's Gardens, contains the Crown Jewels and the Royal Family's 
most precious objects collected for more than 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same stop is the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Demmark's National Gallery, 
with Danish and international art from the 13th Century to the present. 
</P>
<P>
Buses also stop near the Botanical Gardens (stop No. 10), The Royale Theatre 
(stop No. 5) and The national Museum (Stop No. 3). The buses run every half 
hour between 10:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. seven days a week between mid-June and 
the beginning of September. Explanatory guides are available on the buses in 
Danish, English and German. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are good for 24 hour periods and cost 20 Danish kroner, or about $3.50 
U.S. for adults and half-price for children.

WHICH AMERICANS ARE ALLOWED TO GO

<TEXT>
<P>
Who can go there: Can you investigate Cuba for yourself? Aren't Cuba's borders 
closed to Americans? 
</P>
<P>
Sort of. A U.S. embargo, part of the ominously named Trading With the Enemy 
Act, limits travelers to those going on family visits, official government 
business, news-gathering assignments, educational research or as guests of a 
Cuban institution. The purpose, as stated in the U.S. guidelines, "is to 
isolate Cuba economically and deprive it of U.S. dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Cuba, on the other hand, welcomes pretty much anyone, and the common currency 
(outside of the Cuban peso) is the American dollar. The embargo, regulated by 
the U.S. Treasury department, is trade-related and restricts Americans from 
spending money there. 
</P>
<P>
If you work in the entertainment industry, you can go for the film festival 
each December. If you teach Latin American history or a related topic, you 
might be able to organize a professional research group of people in the same 
field and Marazul may be able to put together a trip. If you have eligibility 
questions, call the Office of Foreign Assets Control at (202) 376-0392. 
</P>
<P>
The way things are changing in the rest of the world, the restrictions -- 
established by the United States, not Cuba -- can only become less impassable. 
Last year, about 8,500 Americans visited the island. 
</P>
<P>
Tours: Marazul Tours, a New York City tour packager, specializes in trips to 
Cuba, and handled fairly competently my reservations, although there was no 
visa under my name when I landed in Havana from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Marazul can be reached at (800) 223-5334, and ask for Bob Guild. Marazul can 
tell you more precisely who qualifies and who doesn't. It also arranges charter 
flights from Miami and hotel accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
For a fixed fee (about $700 a week), tour groups will set up and prepay 
airfare, hotel rooms and meals in the hotels. John Horn

LACK OF HOSPITALITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently returned from a cross-country automobile trip between Arroyo Grande, 
Calif., and Tampa, Fla., and discovered there is a lack of hospitality provided 
tourists who cross into California. From New Mexico eastward to Florida, every 
state provides a welcome station after the border is crossed. 
</P>
<P>
California doesn't offer that service. When you cross into California from 
Arizona, there is an agricultural checkpoint, but no welcome station. 
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama not only provide a major welcome station 
with clean restrooms and plenty of personnel to answer your questions, but they 
offer maps and brochures. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe California has a good reason for not having a tourist welcome station at 
the border, but it seems to be a penny-wise, pound-foolish policy.

MIDDLE EAST: THE ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT'S UNEXPECTED ELECTORAL VICTORY IN

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten days ago, in Algiers' modern seafront Ibn Khaldoun Hall, the Middle East 
passed a little-noticed milestone. Mohammed Salah Mohamedi, Algeria's 
soft-spoken, graying interior minister, revealed the stunning news. It took 
only three minutes. The country's first multiparty election since independence 
from France 28 years ago, he announced solemnly, had been swept by Islamic 
fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Then he walked out, leaving behind a thunderstruck crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the 1979 Iranian revolution has an Islamic party's victory been so 
decisive. And never before has Islam so overwhelmingly routed a long-dominant 
power by democratic means. 
</P>
<P>
In a world topsy-turvy with new political formulations, Islam has now proved 
that it is among the most dynamic and energetic forces. And the reverberations 
of what happened in Algeria are not limited to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
From India's Kashmir and the Soviet Union's Asian republics, through the Arab 
heartland and into North Africa, every victory for Allah fuels the 
fundamentalists' simplistic campaign slogan: "Islam is the solution." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Algerian campaign was qualitatively different from the vengeful Islamic 
convulsions witnessed in Iran's revolution and the takeover of Saudi Arabia's 
Grand Mosque in 1979, in the violent aftermath of Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat's assassination in 1981, and in Lebanese extremism since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The decisive victories by the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria's municipal 
and regional elections "demonstrated that Islamicists can work within the 
system and abide by the rules of the game. That's a plus for liberalism," said 
John Entelis, an Algerian expert at Fordham University. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what happened in Algeria, a socialist state, now confirms a trend that 
has been emerging during the past three years in disparate political systems. 
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, a nation inching slowly toward democracy, the Muslim Brotherhood 
became the largest opposition force in the National Assembly in 1987. In 
Jordan, a monarchy, the first election in 22 years resulted, in 1989, in a new 
Parliament with more than one-third fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
In this second phase of the Islamic resurgence, the Iranian model has been 
shunned and fanatics' bullets forsaken for ballots of moderation. Islam and 
democracy may not be incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
Islam's victories, of course, have not happened in a vacuum. In Algeria, the 
Islamic Salvation Front won in part because of the failure of a revolutionary 
party that just three decades ago captured the imagination of struggling 
nations around the world by battling the powerful French Army for independence. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, Algeria has been plagued by strikes and discontent over 
issues ranging from chronic housing shortages and land policies to education. 
During the last round of violence, in October, 1988, an estimated 400 died. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, Muslim demands for change are no different than in Eastern 
Europe. In a country with at least 25% unemployment, people want jobs. In 
Algiers, where the legendary Casbah is teeming with several times more people 
than it can hold, people want housing. With a $26-billion debt, Algeria has 
limited funds to address grievances. Algerians were voting as much against a 
bankrupt system as for Islam. 
</P>
<P>
The discontent was visible the day the election results were announced. Long 
lines formed in front of striking gas stations. For three days, Algiers was 
without newspapers, also on strike. Garbage collectors joined the boycott; 
piles of garbage accumulated on streets throughout the Mediterranean capital. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, of course, does Islam have all the solutions. Despite its motto, the 
Islamic Salvation Front's campaign lacked specific cures for Algeria's 
problems. But Islamic groups are providing alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the garbage strike, bearded men dressed in coarse-cotton 
galibeyah robes, the traditional Algerian dress, collected the slimy piles of 
refuse with their bare hands. The front had mobilized its followers. 
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood also boasted "Islam is the solution," 
Islamic societies have established hundreds of clinics and schools with 
first-rate social services at no or marginal cost -- in stark contrast to 
costly private facilities and inefficient government institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The risky gambles by the leaders of Algeria, Egypt and Jordan in opening the 
political dikes may offer a lesson in how to deal with Islam: Include 
fundamentalists rather than confront them. Co-opt the Islamic tide by forcing 
them to share the burden of solving staggering problems. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one of the reasons Islam has become so potent is due to the absence of 
democratic outlets -- in Algeria for 28 years, in Jordan for 22 and in Egypt, 
where the Muslim Brotherhood has been banned since 1954, for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative is evident in Tunisia, which held local elections the day 
before Algeria's election. After fundamentalists running as independents won 
12% in last year's legislative election, the government banned the Islamic En 
Nahda, or the Renaissance Party, from running. 
</P>
<P>
Tunisia claimed that the ruling party won 99% of the vote, which both European 
and U.S. officials conceded was hardly representative in a country also 
witnessing strong Islamic political fervor. En Nahda's moderate leader, Rachid 
Ghannouchi, recently said that he feared the government's intransigence would 
lead to open confrontation and bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
A different danger is growing in Israel's occupied territories. Prolonged 
suspension of the U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
PLO's inability to show progress in its political strategy are almost certain 
to increase the appeal of two Islamic groups -- one comparatively moderate, the 
other extremist -- that have taken deep root since the intifada began in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing the Islamic card is still, however, a risk. The excesses and rhetoric 
after decades of suppression will frighten both Middle East and Western 
governments. But the beards and the veils, the militant chants of the mosques' 
muezzins and the raids on bars that sell alcohol are smaller threats than 
further repression. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Algeria is a test case. The Islamic Salvation Front has two 
"tendencies": One pledges support for Algeria's emerging multiparty democracy. 
The other advocates an Islamic regime and spouts fiery warnings about 
Mohammed's army marching on the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the June 12 vote, Algeria may be forced to bring forward 
parliamentary elections not required until 1992. The front has demanded that 
they be held within three months. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the ruling National Liberation Front appealed for an alliance of 
secular parties to oppose the Islamic front. And it rejected "all attempts to 
bring Islam back to an era of charlatanism and myth and make it an instrument 
of demogogy and political opportunism." 
</P>
<P>
Since up to 40% of the electorate did not vote, the National Liberation Front 
could make a partial comeback. And President Chadli Bendjedid's term is not up 
until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
But, again, confrontation will only encourage extremism. The threshold has 
already been crossed in Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not the (National Liberation Front) clings to power, the name of 
the game has now changed irrevocably,' said Augustus Richard Norton, a Middle 
East specialist at the U.S. Military Academy. "The revolution in Iran 
distracted us from the real political wave in Islam, which is the struggle for 
domestic justice and survival."

CHINA'S LEADER ANSWERS CAL POLY STUDENTS: THE 'INCIDENT' IS BEHIND US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jiang Zemin, Jiang Zemin is general secretary of the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

BEIJING 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In March, nine political science students at Cal Poly in Pomona wrote to 
China's Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, posing an array of questions about 
the society and politics of China. On June 11, Jiang replied. It should not, of 
course, be surprising to find both the studied absence of truth and the bald 
display of reality in Jiang's letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The truths Jiang denies are manifold: the machine-gunning of unarmed 
protesters on the streets of Beijing; the collapse of the party's legitimacy in 
much of the country; the failure of socialist planning as a tool for economic 
development; the extraordinary growth of the country's fledgling, and now 
suspect, private sector. His insistence that the "incident" of June 4 "is now 
behind us" borders on the grotesque; so seared in the minds of Chinese is last 
year's slaughter that it is now talked of as a seminal event in China's 
20th-Century history. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the realities. Jiang makes it quite clear that he foresees only 
a China led by the Communist Party down a road of socialism. In his world, 
there is only "socialist democracy" (read: no democracy), socialist development 
(read: continued poverty and corruption) and "letting a hundred flowers bloom 
and a hundred schools of thought contend" (read: no freedom of thought, no 
freedom of expression, no freedom of speech). 
</P>
<P>
 Following is an excerpt of Jiang's letter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Edward A. Gargan Council on Foreign Relations 
</P>
<P>
Last year's disturbances in Beijing were by no means spontaneous. There were 
indeed a handful of people, both inside and outside China, who attempted to 
overthrow the constitutional people's government and the socialist system in 
China through unlawful means and by exploiting the student unrest and the 
errors and problems in our work . . . . Protecting the socialist system was the 
fundamental reason why we resolutely quelled the disturbances and rebellion . . 
The incident is now behind us, and we believe that its impact will recede 
before long. 
</P>
<P>
To realize the modernization of China, it is essential for the Chinese people 
to work hard. China's social system guarantees the workers, peasants and 
intellectuals the full right to determine their own destiny by participating in 
the administration of state and social affairs as citizens of the country and 
society. They enjoy the right to democracy and freedom as provided for by the 
constitution and law, enjoy the fundamental human rights as protected by the 
constitution and laws, and have the opportunity and channels to express their 
views fully, including differing opinions. To enliven and enrich science and 
culture, we have all along implemented the policy of "letting a hundred flowers 
bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." We have encouraged 
constructive discussions and contention among different schools of thought and 
artistic views. Of course, we do not tolerate activities carried out by a tiny 
number of people to subvert China's socialist system, or give them "freedom" to 
break the law. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a few foreigners fail to understand our struggle against "bourgeois 
liberalization." It should be explained that the term "bourgeois 
liberalization" has a specific political meaning to us, that is, the erroneous 
trends of thought and political tendencies to negate in China the socialist 
system and the leadership by the Chinese Communist Party . . China's political 
restructuring is focused on improving socialist democracy and the socialist 
legal system, to ensure effectively that the people enjoy status and rights as 
citizens of the country. The past decade saw marked progress in this 
connection: improvement in the system of the people's congresses; formulation 
of a series of important laws and regulations and intensified supervision over 
the implementation of the constitution and laws. There has been improvement in 
the democratic election process, including direct elections held for people's 
deputies at the township, town and county levels and competitive elections for 
people's deputies at all levels and for some government leaders. Various 
channels have been opened for all forms of participation in political affairs 
and decision-making on the basis of improved multiparty cooperation and 
political consultation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent social shocks, the development of the economy, building up 
of democracy and the legal system, as well as economic and political structural 
reforms, should all proceed in the light of China's realities and in a guided, 
systematic and orderly way. In China, stability is of paramount importance. 
Without it, our modernization drive, reform and opening-up efforts would be 
empty talk. 
</P>
<P>
In introducing political structural reform, we will not only draw experience 
from countries with similar social systems, but also from capitalist countries 
when it serves our purposes. However, in no circumstance should we merely copy 
them. The basic conclusion derived from years of historical experience is that 
we must base ourselves on China's realities, pursue our course independently 
and build socialism with Chinese characteristics. . . In spite of the drastic 
changes that have taken place in the world, the common interests between China 
and the United States are still there. So people with foresight have wisely 
realized that the interests we share are far more important than our 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of Sino-U.S. relations during the past decade is based on 
the principles set forth in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, that is, 
mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual 
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equality and 
mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence. Facts show that as long as these 
principles are observed by the two sides, their relations will develop on a 
sound basis. Otherwise, they will come to a standstill, suffer setbacks or even 
move backward. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in East Europe only indicate a setback in the course of socialist 
development. One should not conclude from this that socialism has failed or 
collapsed. A new system with innate vitality, the socialist system is not a 
weak system; it is capable of withstanding the test of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
China has chosen socialism not because of external reasons but because of its 
own national conditions and needs. What the Chinese people want to do now is 
not to choose another social system, but to find out how to develop a socialist 
system that is already in place. They want to further promote China's economic 
development and all-round social progress and keep raising the people's 
material well-being and cultural life. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, we suffered enough from foreign interference and bullying. While 
we have no intention whatsoever of imposing our values and ideology on others, 
we do not wish to see someone act as a "school master" or make irresponsible 
comments on China's affairs . . . . Since the founding of New China, multiparty 
cooperation has all along been carried out under the leadership of the 
Communist Party of China. This proves to be an effective exercise in China, an 
exercise that we shall continue.

A GOOD IDEA GONE SOUR: CAN BANK INSURANCE FAIL?; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: STEP ASIDE, SAVINGS AND LOANS. PROBLEMS WITH INSURANCE FOR COMMERCIAL 
BANKS MAY CAUSE ANOTHER CRISIS. THIS TIME, IT MAY BE WORSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Chicago Law School.

<TEXT>
<P>
The collapse of the savings-and-loan industry is already the most costly 
regulatory failure in the world. But even as that crisis unfolds, another is 
looming: Federal insurance of bank deposits, once considered an American 
birthright, may now be a luxury we can no longer afford. 
</P>
<P>
The $500-billion price tag on the bailout of the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corporation is bloating the federal deficit, fueling inflationary 
pressures and putting upward pressure on interest rates. The government fire 
sale of thrift assets is also wreaking chaos on real-estate markets. 
</P>
<P>
So far the problem has been isolated, in the relatively obscure S&amp;L 
industry. But the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's program at the 
nation's 14,000 commercial banks is identical to the system used for insuring 
S&amp;Ls -- a system we know doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, banking experts are now predicting the imminent collapse of the 
insurance fund that backs the commercial banking industry. Commercial bank 
failures are on the rise while the FDIC's losses are at an all-time high, and 
their loss reserves at near-record lows. The bankruptcy of the FDIC's insurance 
fund would be a body blow that even the resilient U.S. economy could not 
withstand. Economic collapse could ensue. 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain irony in all this. After all, the original purpose of 
federally-backed insurance for deposit accounts -- one of the proudest legacies 
of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal -- was to prevent bank failures by ensuring 
public confidence in the banking system. But government mismanagement of the 
deposit insurance system has created a set of perverse incentives that have 
fostered bank failures by encouraging irresponsibility and excessive 
risk-taking on the part of bank shareholders, management and boards of 
directors. Far from curing the bank failure disease, government-backed deposit 
insurance has only masked its symptoms while the disease itself was growing out 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
The basically sound idea has been twisted by regulatory irresponsibility and 
ineptitude. Federally backed deposit insurance was supposed to instill public 
confidence in the banking system by assuring depositors that the money they 
have in their bank accounts will be available when they need it. Because banks 
keep less cash on hand than is necessary to meet their obligations to 
depositors at any given time, in the absence of deposit insurance, there is 
reason for depositors to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Banks typically keep a high percentage of their liabilities in the form of 
demand or near-demand deposit accounts. But banks do not keep depositors' money 
in their vaults. They invest it in long-term, relatively illiquid assets such 
as commercial loans and mortgages, keeping only a fraction in cash on hand at 
the bank to meet depositors' needs. Consequently, all depositors cannot get 
access to their funds simultaneously. If they tried, even the healthiest bank 
would be unable to liquidate its investments in time to meet its obligations to 
all of its depositors. Normally, all depositors will not want all their cash at 
the same time. But in a world without deposit insurance, depositors know they 
can get their cash only if they are among the first through the door during a 
panic, avoiding the possibility of finding the bank's cash reserves depleted by 
others who got there first. 
</P>
<P>
Without deposit insurance, the me-first mentality can also be triggered 
whenever depositors believe their bank has made bad investments and may not 
have enough money to pay off all depositors in the future. Banks are vulnerable 
to rumors about panics and insolvency because depositors can withdraw their 
money and shift it to other banks easily and quickly. The solution to this 
problem was federal deposit insurance, which eliminates the incentives of 
individual depositors to withdraw their funds from banks on the basis of 
rumors, because depositors know the government will back the obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, embedded within the deposit insurance concept are the seeds of 
its own destruction. Deposit insurance makes people see little difference 
between putting their money in banks that are well run and others that are not. 
</P>
<P>
To make matter worse, deposit insurance gives bankers incentives to gamble 
depositors' money on excessively risky projects. Normally, any investor, 
including depositors, will demand to be compensated for investing in high-risk, 
high-return projects. But depositors will not demand such a "risk premium" if 
their investments are protected by the federal government. This allows bankers 
to make excessively risky loans without having to pay higher interest rates to 
attract depositors. With deposit insurance, the banker who invests in safe 
investments with low rates of return must pay the same to attract deposits as 
the banker who invests in risky projects with high rates of return. If these 
projects do not pan out, the government is left holding the bag. 
</P>
<P>
This problem would be easy for the government to correct. By charging banks a 
fee for deposit insurance based on the riskiness of their activities, banks 
would have an incentive to make safer investments with depositors' funds. 
</P>
<P>
But deposit insurance has been transformed from a program to protect depositors 
into a program that protects banks. Poorly run banks, like other poorly run 
businesses, should be allowed to fail. And when a bank fails, the FDIC should 
handle the problem in the way Congress envisioned when it enacted the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act in 1935. It calls for insolvent banks to be closed and 
liquidated while insured depositors to be paid off promptly and in full. 
Depositors with accounts in excess of the $100,000 limit on insured deposits 
are to become general creditors of the failed bank. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, government bailouts of failed banks have become the norm. Banking 
regulators gradually have expanded depositor protection to include even the 
largest, most sophisticated depositors. 
</P>
<P>
This misguided policy has its origins in the decision of the FDIC to bail out 
the Continental Illinois bank in 1984. The FDIC decided that it could not let a 
bank as large as Continental go under because of the ripple effect that would 
have on the rest of the economy. The result was that all depositors -- even 
those with deposits well in excess of $100,000 ceiling -- were covered. The 
government announced that some U.S. banks simply were too large to fail. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, principles of fairness and equal treatment for banks of all sizes led the 
FDIC to promise to bail out all depositors. The size of the bank did the 
matter. The results have been catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
The solutions to the current mess are simple. The government should require 
banks to purchase highly liquid short-term assets so that short-run liquidity 
crunches will not automatically induce bank failure. The government should vary 
the price for deposit insurance on the basis of risk. Finally, insolvent banks, 
regardless of size, should be liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
These changes would protect the public not only from the social costs of bank 
failures, but also from the social costs of federally funded deposit insurance.

<P>
THE MARSHALL PLAN, TO REBUILD A WAR-DEVASTATED EUROPE, CHANGED AMERICA'S ROLE 
IN THE WORLD. BUT WHEN GEORGE MARSHALL ANNOUNCED THE PROGRAM, FEW REALIZED WHAT 
HIS REMARKS WOULD MEAN. ED GRAY, IN HIS BOOK 'GENERAL OF THE ARMY' EXPLAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ed Cray, Ed Cray, author of the new book General of the Army (W.W. Norton, 
1990), from which this is excerpted, is an associate professor of journalism at 
USC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the debut of a new Opinion feature -- an excerpt of a major non-fiction 
work timed to coincide with the publication of the book's review in The Times. 
Mark A. Stoler's review of "General of the Army" appears on Page 11 of the Book 
Review section. 
</P>
<P>
The applause began at the far end of the maple- and elm-shrouded quadrangle. 
The sound rolled toward the platform on the steps of Memorial Church, swelling 
as the 8,000 in the audience recognized the tall figure heading the column of 
men to be awarded honorary degrees this pleasant June morning in 1947. George 
Catlett Marshall had come to Harvard Yard for its 286th commencement, to be 
proclaimed a doctor of laws, honoris causa. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard President James B. Conant read the citations, first in Latin, then in 
English. The last was Marshall's, the honorary degree, Conant announced, going 
to "an American to whom freedom owes an enduring debt of gratitude, a soldier 
and statesman whose ability and character brook only one comparison in the 
history of this nation." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall had agreed to speak, but insisted his not be the major address of the 
day. For all that, Marshall, never a very effective speaker when reading a 
prepared address, was to give a speech that Harvard has silently hoped 
succeeding honorees might match perhaps once a generation. 
</P>
<P>
Fumbling with his reading glasses, Marshall began with a softly spoken thank 
you for the implied comparison to George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the secretary of state set his glasses on his nose and began reading, 
slowly. "I need not tell you that the world situation is very serious . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking just the right forum, Marshall had agreed to accept the honorary degree 
shortly after his return from the Moscow foreign ministers conference six weeks 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, April 29, 1947, the secretary of state summoned George F. Kennan to 
his office at New State. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe is in a mess," Marshall told Kennan, the head of State's new Policy 
Planning Staff. "Something will have to be done." Kennan was to draw up a plan. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, Marshall was gravely concerned about Soviet intentions in Europe. 
"It was my feeling that the Soviets were doing everything possible to achieve a 
complete breakdown in Europe," he explained later, "that is, they were doing 
anything they could think of to create greater turbulence. The major problem 
was how to counter this negative Soviet policy and restore the European 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-May, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs William L. Clayton 
returned from Europe, warning of impending collapse. Clayton drafted a 
memorandum that made its way to Marshall on May 28: "It is now obvious that we 
have grossly underestimated the destruction to the European economy by the 
war." His memorandum proposed substantial economic assistance to encourage 
European industry -- a grant of "$6 to $7 billion worth of goods a year for 
three years." 
</P>
<P>
That same day Marshall met with Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson, Clayton, 
Kennan, State Department Counselor Ben Cohen and diplomat Chip Bohlen. In view 
of the situation, Marshall said in opening the discussion, they could not 
simply sit back and do nothing. What should they do? 
</P>
<P>
(Harry Truman would not play a direct role in drafting the new policy, leaving 
that to Marshall and the State Department. The President's single contribution 
was to name it. "If we try to make this a Truman accomplishment, it will sink," 
he cautioned a White House adviser. The Marshall Plan would sound "a whole hell 
of a lot better in Congress.") 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Marshall told Acheson he had accepted an invitation from 
Harvard to receive an honorary degree and would probably have to give a short 
speech. He wanted to discuss the economic crisis in Europe. From proposals by 
Clayton, Kennan and Bohlen, the secretary himself compiled his speech. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Marshall stood in Harvard Yard. The breakdown of the economic 
structure of Europe during the war was complete, Marshall told the assembly, 
and recovery seriously retarded by the lack of a peace treaty with Germany and 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Production was niggardly. Unable to buy goods they wanted, farmers were turning 
crop lands to grazing while people in the cities went hungry. Europe was forced 
to spend foreign credits on food, thereby slowing reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is that Europe's requirements for the next three or 
four years of foreign food and other essential products -- principally from 
America -- are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must 
have substantial additional help or face economic, social and political 
deterioration of a very grave character." 
</P>
<P>
To the isolationists, the secretary addressed his next comments. "Aside from 
the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of 
disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, 
the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. 
It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to 
assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which 
there can be no political stability and no assured peace." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall then extended the offer. "Our policy is directed not against any 
country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its 
purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit 
the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can 
exist." The Soviet Union and its dependencies could participate, if they chose 
to. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall turned next to what Truman considered the key section of the address, 
the new concept of formerly fierce competitors working together to foster 
economic recovery. The European countries had to jointly plan their recovery 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The initiative, I think, must come from Europe," Marshall said. "The role of 
this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of a European 
program and of later support of such a program so far as it may be practical 
for us to do so." 
</P>
<P>
The program asked much, in particular "a willingness on the part of our people 
to face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placed upon our 
country . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On the airplane to Boston, he had added what was for him a plea. America was 
insulated from a Europe of rubble, of cold, of hunger, too remote perhaps to 
grasp the urgency of the situation. "Yet the whole world's future hangs on a 
proper judgment, hangs on the realization of the American people of what can 
best be done, of what must be done." 
</P>
<P>
The grads rose to their feet, cheering, but applauding the man more than the 
speech. Few seemingly realized that the address delivered in such flat cadences 
was charting a new course in American foreign policy, summoning a generosity of 
spirit that would animate American foreign policy for decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
The European reaction came with unexpected speed. British Foreign Minister 
Ernest Bevin heard a BBC report of this "exceptionally important speech," and 
telephoned French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault. Bevin then contacted 
Vyacheslav M. Molotov in Moscow, proposing the three meet in Paris on June 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Bloc response was ambivalent. Both Poland and Czechoslovakia 
expressed interest in participating in the plan. The Soviet Union, however, was 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
Still -- and that a reflection of some debate within the Kremlin's councils -- 
Moscow did not rule out participation in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
On June 27, Molotov, Bidault and Bevin met in Paris to weigh Marshall's 
proposal. Molotov, "Old Ironpants" of a hundred stubborn negotiations, backed 
and filled for the next week, uncharacteristically indecisive. He refused to 
list Soviet assets, to state Soviet needs or, most threatening, to allow a 
central European body to set priorities in disbursing the expected U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
Molotov appeared to the other foreign ministers to be stalling, waiting for 
instructions from Moscow, warily seeking some way for the Soviet Union to sit 
at the American table. Stone-faced, he held his cards close to the vest until 
the afternoon of July 2, 1947. In the midst of a discussion of the presentation 
of their dollar needs, an aide handed Molotov what was obviously a hastily 
decoded telegram. Molotov read it, then shortly left the hall. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Molotov coldly withdrew. The Russians would not participate in 
the Marshall Plan. The plan "will lead to nothing good," he complained, but 
would "split Europe into two groups of states." 
</P>
<P>
On Josef Stalin's orders, the Czechs and Poles abruptly followed. From Moscow, 
Ambassador Walter Bedell Smith radioed Marshall that these moves constituted "a 
declaration of war by the Soviet Union on the immediate issue of the control of 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
East and West were split.

CONTROVERSY OVER FLAG AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now let's see if I have this right. On the one hand President Bush is making a 
big push to protect the flag from "desecration" and on the other he is going to 
veto a bill that would protect workers from losing their jobs if they had to 
take time off because of a personal emergency. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that what he is telling us is that he is more interested in 
protecting a piece of cloth than he is in protecting citizens from financial 
ruin. He sure is a "kinder gentler guy." 
</P>
<P>
It's probably fitting that he used the Iwo Jima flag-raising statue as a 
backdrop for his demagogic pitch to make the world safer for flags because, as 
many people know, that famous photograph that the statue was modeled from, was 
as disingenuous as he is. It wasn't made in battle, it was just a photo-op that 
was posed the day after Mount Suribachi was secured.

CONTROVERSY OVER FLAG AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has Congress stopped to consider that attempted passage of the flag burning 
amendment will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars? Agendas must be 
printed, meetings must be held, lobbyists must be paid. And all 50 state 
legislatures must deliberate, each printing up their own agendas, etc. 
</P>
<P>
While protecting the flag is a noble goal, that money could better be spent on 
education or fighting drugs, where it would have a real impact on people's 
lives, not just preventing one kook a year from burning a flag.

CONTROVERSY OVER FLAG AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying by law to bind the conscience of persons who think that they are above 
the rule of law is as futile as enacting that the sun shall rise in the west. 
Justice William Brennan and his gang, confident that they will never be called 
to account, will simply violate the latest constitutional amendment as eagerly 
as they defied the first in Texas vs. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is rather to impeach and depose of them. Replace them with honest 
public servants who will obey the laws that we already have, and no tampering 
with the Constitution will be necessary. Only then will a government of laws, 
not of men, become a reality in this country. 
</P>
<P>
I could not care less about the flag; I could not care more about the 
perversion of the Constitution, be it by Brennan or by Bush.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1946 I, my wife and our 4-year-old son were finally permitted to leave 
Poland after living through the years of the Holocaust in a ghetto and losing 
all of our family. Our train finally crossed the Polish border and continued on 
the way to Germany and the American Zone. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing that struck our vision was the American flag. We will never 
forget it. For us it meant freedom, the true embodiment of the golden gate for 
the masses yearning to be free, the wonderful lamp of the Statue of Liberty. 
That's what we told our boy. He, too, will remember it just as we do. 
</P>
<P>
Those who violate and desecrate the flag should know about it. Our legislators 
should realize that burning this symbol of freedom and the symbol of everything 
that this nation stands for will be in jeopardy if we let this assault on the 
flag go unpunished.

PERSPECTIVES ON L.A. ARCHITECTURE; 
</P>
<P>
DO THE 'ART POLICE' HAVE A ROLE?; 
</P>
<P>
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO MORE PLACE DICTATING THE AESTHETICS OF PRIVATE BUILDINGS 
THAN TELLING A PAINTER WHAT STYLE TO USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT W. MEYER, Kurt W. Meyer is a Los Angeles architect and planner. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, sitting a few months ago in the Roosevelt Room of the White 
House, praised American architecture, saying, "Its rich variety of styles and 
regional differences is as diverse and as dynamic as the American people 
themselves; the spirit of our country can be seen in our architecture." 
</P>
<P>
This admirable spirit is under siege in Los Angeles. City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky is among those rejecting a proposed building in his district purely 
on his dislike of the architectural design, saying, "We have a right to be 
involved in the design review process, because we are the ones who have to look 
at the building for the rest of our lives, onceit's up." 
</P>
<P>
The councilman has it wrong. Government-controlled art and architecture are a 
disaster for any community or nation. Germany produces some of today's best 
architects, but it took decades to recover from the Third Reich's bombastic 
"Aryan" art dictates and oppression of the free, creative spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a democracy, a strong group can beguile and mesmerize a public that is 
already beset by fears that high density of development and freeway traffic 
jams are ruining the quality of life. Such groups have the answer: Interfere 
with development, file lawsuits, make it expensive and eventually the project 
will go away. The owner grows disgusted and gives up; at the least the building 
will be delayed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Many tools are available to the zealot; but here we are only interested in the 
government's role in dictating, prescribing and approving the aesthetic design 
of privately owned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The city's design review board process was established to interfere in just the 
wrong ways. Since aesthetic judgment is subjective, the zealot on the board can 
object to any project he or she wishes, often disregarding vested rights. 
</P>
<P>
And why do the design review boards (appointed by the City Council) even exist? 
Because some true travesties have been built: developments that should never 
have been allowed because of their impact on the neighborhoods. However, they 
should have been prevented because of their negative social impact and not 
because of the subjective judgment of some people who disliked a particular 
design. 
</P>
<P>
It is not possible to legislate excellence or beauty in buildings, just as it 
is not possible to legislate excellence in the fine arts -- or even in 
politics. What can be legislated is careful planning. Clear land-use and 
development standards are designed to protect the interest of the public: the 
health and welfare of society. This must be done by updating the city's General 
Plan and its individual community plans -- not over the next 10 to 15 years, 
but now. 
</P>
<P>
But while protecting the public, these planning laws must not control the 
thinking and the product of the design community. 
</P>
<P>
Free the designers and Los Angeles will develop an eclectic style that reflects 
its heterogenous, multi-ethnic history and composition. Aesthetics is simply 
not the politicians' arena. 
</P>
<P>
Will we still end up with some "bad" building designs? Of course. Will we also 
produce some extraordinary building designs? Absolutely, because no art police 
will be standing by to pull the designer down to the lowest common denominator. 
The designs that emerge will create urban beauty that reflects this era, these 
times; it will be the truest reflection of our society and civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles can display its boundless creative energy, fashioned in a 
democratic society rather than the rigid and one-dimensional order of an 
autocratic system of government, or of one councilman's concept of "beauty."

THE RIGHT THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Doing the Right Thing," by Clancy Sigal (April 29): It is almost 
hilarious, but utterly appalling, that Young Americans for Freedom attack the 
ideology that provides them with license and the freedom to stand on their hind 
legs and howl. Were they alive at the time of the men who founded this country, 
these crankies would be soundly spanked, their mouths washed out with soap and 
sent back to King George's England for some further seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
This democracy is blessed in that it has not fallen prey to those who believe 
they are the only true patriots.

It is not hard to understand why the Young Americans for Freedom see both the 
government and business interests as enemies of the people. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD scandal is just one example where big business, and big government, 
under the guise of being "custodians of the poor," conspire to feed at the 
public trough. 
</P>
<P>
I am still a Republican, so as to remain socially acceptable. However, a large 
part of my heart and mind goes out to the Young Americans for Freedom, as I 
become increasingly disgusted and disillusioned by the liberal values of our 
society.

YAF is an organization that routinely attacks and intimidates young Republicans 
who will not join their organization or support their positions or candidates 
in statewide elections. They attempt to harass Republicans who do not agree 
100% with YAF positions and will resort to criminal actions in their campaign 
to "purify" the California Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
When a hawkish, capitalist, pro-life conservative like myself is labeled a 
"liberal" or a "Commie" by YAFfers because I will not support their strong-arm 
tactics, YAF has gone too far.

In "Doing the Right Thing," a YAF activist in San Diego said: "I wasn't there 
during black slavery -- why should I pay for it?" My first response, I must 
admit, was anger, and I went to my computer in a burst of indignation to dash 
off a reply to this individual's self-centered ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
But the more I looked at that quote, the more I came to realize that in a 
certain warped way, I agree with it. 
</P>
<P>
I am a black man. Statistically speaking, that means that in terms of virtually 
every indicator of life-quality, I am heir to more than my fair share of 
misery. It means that, as far as the police are concerned, I was born a 
suspect. It means that I am slandered and libeled with numbing regularity by 
mass media, which reduce me to bite-sized, easily digestible bits of stereotype 
rather than dealing with me as a whole human being. And finally, it means a 
legacy of frustration whose depth defies words. 
</P>
<P>
So, yes, I agree with that nameless YAFfer. I wasn't there during black 
slavery, either, and I shouldn't have to pay for it. But I do. Every day, I do.

Why is it not surprising that Young Americans for Freedom is so attractive to 
the fundamentalist Christian right when it attracts the kind of person who can 
say, "Compassion is someone else's job" -- thereby blithely violating one of 
Christ's basic precepts? 
</P>
<P>
The face of hatred never changes. We have seen these same people shouting 
"Nigger bitches!" at blacks trying to integrate American schools and heard them 
even earlier screaming "Jew bitch!" in Hitler's Germany.

Nothing has changed but the targets.

DISASTER: MAIN QUAKE KILLED 40,000, SOME OFFICIALS SAY. TOWN OF ROUDBAR, CENTER

ROUDBAR, Iran 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strong aftershocks sent panicked residents rushing into the streets of northern 
Iran on Saturday, and mass graves were dug for victims of a massive earthquake 
that some officials say killed at least 40,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimated that at least 10,000 people died here in Roudbar alone. 
Roudbar is a mountain town on the banks of the Safid River, and it had a 
population of about 20,000 before Thursday morning's disaster crushed it flat 
and left it appearing nearly lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were still lifting the limp, battered bodies from the rubble Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
An old woman named Zenab Zohori sat cross-legged on the edge of a perimeter 
road here, her body formless with grief. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother is dead," she moaned. "His children are dead. Everyone is dead. My 
husband's back is broken. I don't know where they have taken him." 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred feet down the road, a family of eight huddled together and wept. 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred feet farther along, a crowd gasped as searchers discovered the 
body of a girl, about 9 years old, under a pile of mud bricks that once formed 
the front wall of her home. 
</P>
<P>
In Roudbar and surrounding villages slammed by the devastating quake and 200 
aftershocks, 90% of the buildings were destroyed. The cities looked as though 
they had been shaken and shifted by a giant hand until they crumbled like sand 
castles. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported that, with the 
lapse of time, hope is fading that more survivors can be found alive under the 
rubble of the devastated region on the Caspian Sea. The temblor, rated at a 
magnitude of 7.3 to 7.7, destroyed dozens of towns and villages. 
</P>
<P>
It was Iran's worst earthquake in this century and the world's worst since 
1976, when a quake in Tangshan, China, killed about 242,000. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous mountain villages remained cut off because landslides blocked roads. 
Medical teams entered other towns to help control the spread of disease. 
</P>
<P>
After the crowd removed the bricks from the girl's lifeless form here in 
Roudbar, carefully masking their faces with handkerchiefs to block out the 
stench, they wrapped her in a blanket and softly chanted Muslim prayers as they 
carried her away. Despite a huge presence of rescue workers, both Iranian and 
international, in this stricken city, there was a shortage of stretchers. 
</P>
<P>
Gravedigger Asghar Sharif said that every body had its own grave, in keeping 
with Muslim tradition. But the number of bodies was so great, he said, that he 
and the other diggers dug graves three at a time and then separated them with 
small wooden partitions. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a remarkable rescue-and-relief effort by the Iranians and foreign 
helpers, most of the survivors appeared to have shelter and food. As foreign 
journalists surveyed the damage from an Iranian air force helicopter, they 
could see troops of French rescue teams in bright orange jumpsuits patrolling 
the roads. 
</P>
<P>
International frictions were suspended for this giant rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk Saturday in one of the rescue camps, two French national firefighters, 
one wearing a flat-top kepi cap, stood chatting casually. Even American 
journalists were welcomed warmly by Iranian officials. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was airlifting blankets, tents, water jugs and other relief 
supplies to Iran. French and Soviet relief teams arrived, and the Vatican and 
nations worldwide sent relief donations. 
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Morteza Sarmadi denied what he 
said were foreign media reports that Iran is not allowing international medical 
and relief teams into the stricken areas. 
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi told IRNA that "in view of the devastation wrought by the earthquake" 
Iran welcomes relief teams, equipment, hospital supplies and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
There was already talk Saturday that one of the legacies of the disaster might 
be the warming of relations between the Western nations and the hostile Tehran 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
By accepting U.S. aid, for example, the Iranians demonstrated that some of 
their leaders had rejected the "great Satan" view of America espoused by the 
late Iranian revolutionary leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
A key figure in the policy on foreign disaster relief is Hussein Mousavian, 
whose title is director general for Western Europe in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs but who many people believe is behind a form of Iranian glasnost 
reflected in the openness to foreign disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian government has decided to accept aid from everywhere except Israel 
and South Africa," said one official. The willingness to accept a wide range of 
help from the United States and Britain indicated some progress, according to 
one professional Iranian journalist who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting versions of the death toll in the disaster. Hussein 
Zeineddin, second secretary with Iran's U.N. Mission in New York, said late 
Friday that according to the latest estimates, at least 40,000 people were 
killed and 100,000 were injured. IRNA, the official news agency, reported 
nearly 29,000 people killed. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest of the more than 200 aftershocks that have hit the region had a 
magnitude of 4.2, the news agency said.

Another large shock jolted the northern city of Rasht early Saturday, "making 
panic-stricken residents take to the streets," IRNA said. There was also a 
third powerful aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
"Aftershocks, which continue in the mountainous areas, are endangering the 
relief operation," IRNA added. 
</P>
<P>
The toll surpassed a quake that killed 25,000 people in nearby Soviet Armenia 
in December, 1988, and a 7.7 quake in Iran in 1978 that also killed 25,000. It 
was the worst previous quake in Iran in this century. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people have learned to resist difficulties, and consider the national 
disaster to be a divine test," President Hashemi Rafsanjani told Syria's 
foreign minister, Farouk Shareh. 
</P>
<P>
"We have submitted ourselves to God's will." 
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials said Rafsanjani has taken personal charge of relief 
operations, and Muslim leaders from around the country organized small armies 
of volunteers to help. 
</P>
<P>
As viewed from an American-built Chinook helicopter carrying 40 foreign 
journalists, the natural beauty of Zanjan province, 100 miles northwest of 
Tehran, contrasted with the grim scenes in the devastated cities of Roudbar and 
its neighbor, Manjil. 
</P>
<P>
Hawks hovered over golden fields of wheat. A solitary turquoise-roofed mosque 
stood vigil on a hilltop. Each mud-walled mountain village had its own fruit 
orchard. 
</P>
<P>
But as the helicopter coursed along the Safid River, the devastation of the 
earthquake became more and more intense. Village after village was leveled. 
Escarpments were crumbled and cracked, leaving jagged boulders at their base. A 
village of 20 houses was completely leveled, looking like an old archeological 
dig. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Manjil, very near the epicenter of the earthquake, was without one 
standing building. Clumps of families, chickens and gamboling goats camped at 
the edge of their former abodes in Iranian Red Crescent tents. Miraculously, a 
major concrete dam between Manjil and Roudbar remained intact, with white water 
pouring through one of its floodgates. If the large dam had broken, several 
villages at its base would have been submerged. 
</P>
<P>
For American journalists, who in recent times have been kept from traveling 
freely in Iran, it was also an opportunity to look at the country more than 10 
years after the Iranian revolution. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some of the infrastructure looked brand-new. A recently finished, 
major six-lane highway between Tehran and the ancient Iranian capital of Qazvin 
was smooth sailing. Even the immense, luxury apartment complex near the airport 
that was started by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi -- who was deposed in 1979 -- 
was near completion. 
</P>
<P>
However, some things remained the same. In the lobby of the former American 
Inter-Continental Hotel was a carefully crafted wall hanging that said in 
English: "Down with U.S.A."

HIGH-TECH SALES STRICTURES SHIFT TO THIRD WORLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The battle to keep strategically sensitive technology safely in the hands of 
the Western democracies is shifting -- from Eastern Europe to the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
As the Cold War winds down in Eastern Europe, the United States and its allies 
have begun to relax prohibitions on Western exports of strategically sensitive 
materials to the former Soviet Bloc. The barriers are dropping at a dazzling 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the allies agreed on a sweeping overhaul of longstanding 
restrictions on high-technology goods ranging from computers to machine tools. 
The changes are intended to ease the way for sales of equipment needed to 
modernize Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the Commerce Department announced that it will end 40-year-old 
requirements that U.S. firms obtain export licenses on high-technology goods 
that they ship to other Western countries -- part of the same export-control 
process. 
</P>
<P>
But the liberalization has focused the international spotlight on a grim 
reality: With the Soviet threat gradually waning, the big danger that the 
Western powers face is the increasing possibility that strategically sensitive 
technology will leak more freely to the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export administration, warns that 
the Western powers must act together to make certain that Third World countries 
do not exploit the opening up of Eastern Europe to "set up shop in what could 
become a technology bazaar." 
</P>
<P>
Such fears are not unfounded. During the years of Soviet domination, 
trafficking of chemicals, armaments and munitions to Third World countries was 
a major source of hard currency for Czechoslovakia and other sophisticated East 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, was loaded 
with Semtex -- a plastic explosive made in Czechoslovakia. Vaclav Havel, the 
country's new democratic president, admits that Libya now has a 40-year supply 
in stock. 
</P>
<P>
And it is not just Eastern Europe that may provide the materials. Taiwan, South 
Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore have the technology and capacity to make 
strategically sensitive equipment, and none of them belongs to any of the 
international conventions that bar sales to the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Plainly apprehensive, the major Western governments have begun moving quietly 
to stem sales of strategically sensitive technology to developing countries -- 
particularly Iraq, Iran, Libya and Syria, which so far have been able to 
purchase such equipment almost at will. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) 
-- the 17-country compact that has overseen postwar restrictions on East-West 
trade -- is hammering out new accords with Eastern Europe that contain some 
safeguards on resales to the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
And the United States and its allies have tightened restrictions -- at least in 
principle -- on North-South sales of technology and equipment that developing 
countries might be able to use in producing missiles and chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But officials here acknowledge that the effort has been slow and frustrating. 
And experts see little hope that the Western governments will be able to 
strengthen their regulations -- or their enforcement activities -- enough to 
deal with the North-South issue satisfactorily. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts concede that the existing enforcement machinery is sketchy. Most 
governments are reluctant to transform Cocom -- which was set up to deal solely 
with East-West trade -- into a North-South agency as well. The agency has 
enough dissension as it is. 
</P>
<P>
And the machinery for controlling exports of missile technology and chemicals 
-- the eight-country Missile Technology Control Regime and the 20-nation 
Australia Group -- are little more than loose compacts, built around vague 
declarations of policy. 
</P>
<P>
The response by the Missile Technology Control Regime, for example, has been 
simply to draw up a list of products that might be useful to would-be missile 
manufacturers, and to pledge -- somewhat generally -- to try to tighten 
controls on who can buy them. 
</P>
<P>
The Australia Group has been more specific, hammering out a list of 50 
particularly dangerous chemicals that its members have agreed not to sell to 
Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria. Nine of these are so sensitive that they can be 
sold only to other members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
But, as shown by recent disclosures of West German sales of mustard-gas 
manufacturing equipment to Libya, enforcement has not always proven 
satisfactory. The rules "are nowhere near being airtight," said a congressional 
arms sales expert. 
</P>
<P>
More ominously, George Rehm, a Washington lawyer who specializes in 
export-control issues, said the fundamental problem is that, unlike computers, 
the technologies involved in chemicals, armaments and munitions are so widely 
held that it is almost impossible to organize all producers. 
</P>
<P>
"The best we could hope for is that the major players who can help developing 
countries take a quantum leap into this new technology will be willing to 
discipline themselves," Rehm said. "We're never going to stop people entirely." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the stakes are becoming higher every day: 
</P>
<P>
* Only last year, Iraq was able to obtain West European and East German help to 
upgrade its Soviet-built Scud-B missiles to a 380-mile range that could easily 
threaten the entire Middle East region. It is now working on a follow-up 
version that is expected to have a range of 550 miles. 
</P>
<P>
* Iran is seeking help from China and North Korea to build a 200-mile missile. 
And Egypt and Iraq may well acquire missiles with a 500-mile range as a result 
of their participation in the Condor program, an international defense effort. 
</P>
<P>
* South Korea has successfully converted U.S.-built, two-stage Nike 
surface-to-air missiles into medium-range surface missiles capable of traveling 
110 to 160 miles -- far enough to counter any threat from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
* Sven Kraemer, deputy director of the Center for Security Policy, a 
Washington-based research group, notes that about half a dozen other Third 
World countries are developing missiles that will enable them to reach well 
into neighboring countries' territory. "That leads us to worry about the 
blackmail threat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Among the countries now capable of producing their own chemical weapons are 
Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, China, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan and possibly 
Israel and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
The picture is not entirely bleak. A new report last week by the Congressional 
Research Service shows that arms sales to the Third World decreased by 24% last 
year to $29.3 billion -- the lowest level since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown, which affected Libya, Syria and Iraq as well as other countries, 
reflects the scaling back of regional conflicts and the heavy debt burdens that 
have left many of these countries unable to afford arms purchases. 
</P>
<P>
But the report also raised the possibility that the slump in arms sales may be 
simply a lull, attributable to the fact that many Third World governments are 
glutted with weaponry they bought in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
With superpower arms-reduction treaties now in the offing, both the United 
States and the Soviet Union are looking to Third World governments as potential 
substitute markets for the weapons churned out by their own defense 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Other big suppliers, such as Brazil and Argentina, have similar expectations. 
</P>
<P>
And even in Eastern Europe's new democracies, arms sales will continue to be 
big. Czechoslovakia's Havel, for example, has asserted that although his 
country will try to limit new sales, it will honor previous contracts with 
Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even a more permanent reduction in Third World arms purchases will 
not reduce the danger that such weapons as chemicals, missile technology and 
nuclear explosives could fall into the hands of irresponsible developing 
countries like Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain countries are a real concern," acknowledged a U.S. export-control 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is only beginning to grapple with the problem. U.S. 
negotiators have been pressing U.S. allies more vigorously to tighten 
international restrictions on the sale of chemicals, nuclear weapons and high 
technology to Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that West Germany and Japan both have stiffened their 
enforcement significantly in recent months, but problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
But whether there will be enough public concern over the issue worldwide to 
force governments to further tighten their enforcement efforts remains to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
"Intellectually, people realize that the stuff is falling into the hands of the 
craziest people abroad," a congressional expert said, "but there just isn't an 
emotional awareness yet. As a result, not much is being done."

PICNICKERS, A-BOMB WASTE SHARING REFUGE IN ILLINOIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like an eerie jungle ruin, the strange but remarkable legacy of the Palos Park 
Forest Preserve has been covered for decades in a tangle of weeds and 
underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
To the unsuspecting eye, there is little to suggest that anything "Top Secret" 
or dangerous went on here. On any warm weekend day, the woods outside this 
southwest Chicago suburb are filled with hikers, cyclists, equestrians, 
picnicking church groups and young lovers out for a stroll and maybe a little 
bit more. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the soil, though, the Palos preserve is strikingly different from any 
other recreation area in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few feet off some of the hiking paths, unprotected by so much as a fence 
and marked only by a few graffiti-stained stone signs, lies the nation's first 
nuclear waste dump. It is a graveyard for residue from the Manhattan Project, 
the crash World War II atomic bomb program, which moved here shortly after 
scientists first split the atom in a crude reactor under the football stands at 
the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
That first reactor was dismantled and rebuilt in the forest preserve, which the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had leased from Cook County. Soon a slightly more 
sophisticated reactor was added to the complex. Years later, the remains of 
both were buried in the woods, along with contaminated equipment, animal 
carcasses and hazardous chemicals used in early nuclear research. 
</P>
<P>
Government experts insist that the dump poses no hazard, despite its primitive 
nature and minor ground-water contamination, which so far is local. Some 
environmental activists disagree and they want the waste removed, at a 
potential cost of tens of millions of dollars. "From any kind of public policy 
point of view, having radioactive material sitting around in a public forest 
preserve is a bad idea," said Carolyn Raffensperger, director of the Illinois 
Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal inspectors regularly monitor the area, even though the 
reactors were decommissioned and the federal government relinquished the site 
decades ago. But serious radiation and toxic leaks at more sophisticated 
nuclear weapons plants have triggered a broad re-examination of the industry's 
overall environmental record. And that probe is now stretching back to the 
harried and mysterious dawn of the Atomic Age. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the area was returned to county control in 1956, 
federal inspectors this summer will survey up to 200 acres of woodland in a 
search for radioactive litter. 
</P>
<P>
That effort was triggered last month, when state inspectors went poking through 
brush outside of what had been the long-abandoned perimeter fence of Site A, as 
the 19-acre research facility was dubbed by military authorities. 
</P>
<P>
On the ground, the inspectors stumbled across an egg-sized lump of pure 
uranium, the kind that would have been used to fuel the first reactor. Also 
scattered through the area were shards of laboratory beakers, scraps of metal 
and blocks of graphite, a common material used to moderate atomic reactions in 
those early days. Only the uranium was radioactive, and at that, just barely. 
</P>
<P>
"We are mounting an effort to find out what is out there," said Brian Quirke, a 
spokesman for the Department of Energy, which inherited responsibility for 
safety at the site from other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, a federal "Tiger Team" of DOE experts is to visit nearby Argonne 
National Laboratory to audit its environmental practices. Quirke said that 
members of the team may also review safety questions involving the forest 
preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its age and the primitive nature of the materials involved, 
government experts insist that the Palos Forest dump poses little danger to the 
public. But, in recent years, at least two picnic wells in the park have been 
closed. The wells were found to be contaminated by small amounts of radioactive 
tritium, a nuclear byproduct that behaves like water. The tritium levels were 
well within federal drinking-water standards, but high enough to cause concern. 
</P>
<P>
Minute amounts of strontium 90 have also been detected in river bottom sediment 
near what is known as Plot M, a separate, 150-by-140-foot dump on a hilltop 
where high-level contaminants from activities at Site A were disposed of until 
1949. Very small quantities of plutonium, technetium, cesium and uranium have 
also been found at isolated spots in the forest preserve, at levels so low that 
it is difficult to tell whether they came from Plot M or from pervasive fallout 
sprinkled worldwide during 1950s atmospheric nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that criticism of the government's handling of the problem is a 
bum rap. They cite several reasons: The atomic bomb project was conceived as a 
mission of national survival, so safety concerns at the time were secondary; 
the dangers of radiation exposure weren't as deeply appreciated during those 
early years, and advances in detection equipment have made it possible to 
pinpoint sources of radiation that would have escaped scrutiny in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still paying for winning World War II," said Rich Allen, an official of 
the Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety involved in radiation sampling work. 
"The Army Corps of Engineers didn't take environmental impact studies. They did 
what was needed. . . . To apply modern-day environmental standards to what 
happened is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, environmental concerns of a sort were what brought the Manhattan 
Project to the Palos preserve in the first place. The first sustained atomic 
reaction took place at the university on Dec. 2, 1942. Since they were breaking 
new ground, scientists working on the project weren't exactly sure how 
radiation might affect the surrounding area. To be on the safe side, they 
decided to move the project out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
They found a site about 20 miles southwest of Chicago on county-owned land once 
used as a Girl Scout camp. At the time, it was remote. It was also one of the 
highest spots in the mostly flat metropolitan Chicago area. Improbable as it 
now sounds, military officials then considered the elevation important because 
it could help them spot any advancing Japanese invasion force and give them 
time to sabotage the complex. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 1,025 acres of land were leased for the facility, but most of it was 
never developed. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Site A became the original location of Argonne, one of the 
country's premier nuclear research facilities. Site A was shut down in 1954, 
when Argonne moved to its present location. Reactor fuel and radioactive heavy 
water were shipped to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee for 
disposal, but parts of both reactors, including the biological cement shield, 
were dumped into a 50-foot-deep pit at Site A and covered with dirt. 
</P>
<P>
From 1944 to 1949, much of the high-level radioactive wastes generated at Site 
A was buried in 6-foot-deep trenches at the nearby Plot M. Not until 1956, when 
the area was decommissioned and returned to the county, was a protective cap 
added. Concrete sidewalls and a foot-thick concrete slab were poured over the 
Plot M waste to protect it from the leaching effects of rain and melting snow. 
No protection was added to the bottom, however. 
</P>
<P>
The recent uranium-fuel discovery has led officials to speculate that there may 
have been a third dump of some kind in the vicinity, apart from Site A. Finding 
evidence of such a disposal site will be one of the goals of this summer's 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
A broader safety concern is the long-term hazard that the wastes pose to water 
supplies. From the government's standpoint, there is no danger. 
</P>
<P>
Experts acknowledge that a plume of low-level contaminants is inching its way 
down from Plot M toward a small stream bed. But they insist that the migration 
is so slow that it would be many years -- if ever -- before those particles 
could reach water sources that could lead to wells outside the park. And by 
then, they say, the radioactivity would have dissipated. Although some homes in 
the area have private wells, most are linked to municipal systems that draw 
water from Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"The degree to which water is contaminated in that area (around Plot M) is 
quite wide and deep," said Allen of the Illinois nuclear agency, "but nobody is 
drawing water from it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Critics discount such assurances. They say that the Energy Department's 
credibility has been undermined by its spotty record in dealing with 
environmental problems at other more prominent waste facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"How can they say it's all low-level radiation when they don't even have 
complete records of what's buried out there?" asked Martin Murray of Broken 
Arrow, an environmental action group. "There was a time when many Americans 
assumed if the government said something it was true, but that time is gone. 
The DOE solution to pollution is delusion." 
</P>
<P>
Broken Arrow wants both Site A and Plot M excavated and the wastes removed, an 
undertaking the group contends the government has estimated could cost $500 
million. Quirke of the DOE said that a 1980 study projected the cost at about 
$10.8 million, though he acknowledged that it would be much higher today. 
</P>
<P>
Costs aside, a DOE audit of the site's environmental impact, released last 
year, concluded that it posed no hazard to the surrounding community. Indeed, 
the report said, to dig up the wastes and move them would be far riskier than 
to leave them alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you move material or bring it to the surface there are increased 
chances of exposure," explained Ken O'Brien, project manager for the new 
environmental survey in the park. "Every bit of exposure, no matter how small, 
involves some risk."

Though the Energy Department is not likely to budge on removal, 
environmentalists have succeeded in pressuring the state into paying for 
water-quality tests on private wells in the area. About 65 private-well owners, 
some as far as 5 miles from the park, have signed up for the tests, which 
should begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
While they welcome the testing program, Willow Springs officials appear dubious 
about the claims of Broken Arrow and its allies. "We're confident that the 
necessary monitoring is going on," said Rob Nellis, the village administrator. 
"It's not that we're not concerned but we're not alarmed. The DOE has been up 
front with us." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, on the other hand, see such a view as shortsighted. "I don't 
want to be an alarmist but we're talking about a proven, known human 
carcinogen," said Joanna Holscher, the Illinois director of Citizens for a 
Better Environment. "The more you're exposed, the more likelihood there is of 
getting cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Quirke disagreed. "This place shouldn't be feared," he argued. "This place 
should be looked at as a place of history. . . . The guys who worked here were 
pioneers. It's a historical gem."

AIDS PROGRAMS FAILING GROUPS AT HIGHEST RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There is growing evidence that prevention programs aimed at stopping the spread 
of the AIDS virus are failing to influence many of those at highest risk, and 
experts say the reasons include a lack of imaginative approaches and a kind of 
societal failure of nerve. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when the course of the epidemic is shifting toward drug users, women, 
adolescents and younger gay men, experts say the reluctance to design explicit 
prevention programs specifically for those groups has left the next generation 
dangerously vulnerable to infection. In interviews and presentations last week, 
prevention specialists discussed the way that public policies and private 
attitudes have contributed to the failure to unravel ingrained patterns of 
sexual behavior and drug use among certain groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been an American tradition of not talking about sex in explicit detail 
. . . and of providing very inadequate health care for people with 
substance-abuse problems," said Don C. Des Jarlais of Mt. Sinai School of 
Medicine in New York City. "AIDS has upped the ante for those traditions." 
</P>
<P>
It has been known for seven years that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
is spread through sex and through the exchange of blood by injection. 
Nevertheless, 40,000 to 80,000 Americans are still becoming infected each year 
with the lethal virus, federal estimates suggest. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of the ability to vaccinate people against the virus, health 
officials and social-service groups have put their faith in education and 
prevention -- an array of programs that includes counseling and testing, 
public-service campaigns, school programs, street outreach and promotion of 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, prevention has been successful: The rate of new infections among 
older gay men in large cities has plummeted. That is evidence, experts say, 
that it is indeed possible to change that most mysterious and instinctive form 
of behavior, human sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
But research presented here at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS 
offered ominous proof that, in other areas, prevention is failing, and that 
many women, teen-agers and drug users continue to engage in unsafe forms of sex 
and drug use and are being infected at rising rates. 
</P>
<P>
For example, despite evidence that more and more intravenous drug users in San 
Francisco say they avoid sharing or using dirty syringes, a federal study found 
little change in other cities. And everywhere, researchers have found high 
rates of unprotected sex among drug users and their partners. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, researchers reported scant use of condoms among teen-agers and women 
of child-bearing age. And a study of young gay men in medium-sized West Coast 
cities found that 43% had practiced unprotected anal intercourse, one of the 
riskiest forms of sex, in the previous six months. 
</P>
<P>
"What it says is new people are entering this pool and they are considering 
themselves invulnerable," said Thomas J. Coates of the Center for AIDS 
Prevention Studies at UC San Francisco. Coates and others criticized existing 
prevention efforts as insufficiently explicit or intensive. 
</P>
<P>
One difficulty is that the epidemic is not monolithic, said Dr. Alan Hinman of 
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. It is many epidemics spreading 
differently in different groups, each group having "unique social and 
psychological characteristics . . . and patterns and standards of behavior." 
</P>
<P>
For example, white and minority drug users often behave differently. Some use 
different methods of injection, some share syringes with strangers instead of 
friends. Prevention programs therefore must address different types of risk; 
some alternatives will appeal to some groups and not to others. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the sexual relationships of white and minority women are often 
different. A woman's role in a relationship will determine how she can 
negotiate safer sex. Young gay men may not identify with older gay men and 
therefore may not respond to messages tailored to older men. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem is not simply the complexity of the epidemic and the 
inscrutable subtleties of behavior, researchers said. They also blamed societal 
wishful thinking -- the belief that it is enough to tell people how the virus 
is spread without giving them accessible tools to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers contended that it is unrealistic to ask many teen-agers to 
simply avoid sex; they need to learn communication skills required to negotiate 
safe sex. As Coates puts it, you don't teach a teen-ager to drive by telling 
him how a car engine works; you put him in a car and show him. 
</P>
<P>
Intravenous drug users, too, are often denied the tools to avoid infection, 
researchers said. Public policies restricting access to addiction treatment 
programs and sterile syringes have left many users with information about AIDS 
risk but without realistic and immediate ways of avoiding it. 
</P>
<P>
"Policies that impair condom or bleach distribution because they might lead to 
increases in sexual activity or drug use ignore the data," Coates said in a 
speech at the conference. "There are no data to support the adverse effects of 
these programs." 
</P>
<P>
"Prevention has to be a lot more than information," said Robert Battjes, of the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, in an interview. "To bring about behavior 
change requires a great deal of intense effort. . . . We've got to be in there 
intervening over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, behavioral scientists agree that widespread behavior change is 
impossible without changing social and community norms -- not unlike the way 
public-health campaigns against smoking over the last two decades have changed 
the image of cigarettes from glamorous to anti-social. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, they called for education and prevention programs that change 
the way people feel about high-risk behavior -- for example, by making safer 
sex seem not a poor substitute for the real thing but erotic, normal and 
perhaps even patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
They pointed to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation's controversial bus-shelter 
poster showing a young, gay couple -- smiling, naked, holding up a condom and 
draped in the flag. Above them, the slogan reads, "Life, liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness."

<TEXT>
<P>
When Tamil Tiger guerrillas abandoned this historic seaside city last week 
without firing a shot, residents rejoiced that they would be spared the horrors 
of war. 
</P>
<P>
Then came news that 32 police officers had been massacred in a nearby town. 
Local police snapped into action. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the police set fire to our homes and shops," said a Tamil shipping clerk 
in an account confirmed by scores of residents. "I saw with my own eyes. I saw 
the police looting our homes." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Tamil-owned homes, shops and businesses were burned and gutted. At 
least 20,000 terrified Tamils and other refugees fled the city. Streets are 
eerily empty except for dogs and military patrols. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people were shot to death, medical officials say, and four burned 
to death in their homes. And 39 others, hauled from the local hospital June 14 
by an army patrol, never returned. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they were put in the tire," said Dr. E. G. Gnanakunalan, hospital 
director and secretary of the Sri Lankan Red Cross. "That means they were 
burned to death." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the deaths and destruction, such civilian reprisals are but a bloody 
footnote in the increasingly brutal ethnic war that tears at this beleaguered 
Indian Ocean nation. 
</P>
<P>
More than 800 people are reported to have been killed in the two weeks since a 
Tamil separatist army called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam attacked up 
to 30 police posts in northern and eastern provinces, resuming a seven-year war 
for an independent Tamil state in this mostly Sinhalese country. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers are a fierce, even fanatical, fighting force. With an estimated 
3,000 to 5,000 troops, their army includes a so-called "baby brigade" of armed 
boys and girls as young as 9. 
</P>
<P>
"They all carry cyanide tablets on a necklace," said Neelan Tiruchelvam, a 
Tamil human rights lawyer in Colombo. "If they're captured, they're expected to 
take it." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tigers apparently are using suicide squads for the first time. Four 
youths who strapped explosives to their bodies were killed trying to run into 
two army posts, the military said. 
</P>
<P>
"The children make good soldiers," noted a Sri Lankan army general in Colombo, 
the capital. "They follow orders. And they don't know right from wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Despite government claims to the contrary, rebel troops still control key 
villages, bridges and road junctions in the Batticaloa district in the east. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the area Thursday found teen-age Tigers patrolling the road east 
from Maya Oya, armed with still-shiny machine guns and AK-47 assault rifles 
taken from police posts. Guerrillas waited in roadside ditches and elephant 
grass, ready to detonate mines at approaching vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Batticaloa itself was mostly deserted, visitors said. Two French doctors from 
the relief group Medecins Sans Frontieres left the city after rebels built 
bunkers by the hospital, turning it into a military target. 
</P>
<P>
A two-day, 750-mile drive through the east also found refugees desperately 
crowding schools, churches and mosques. Government officials say the fighting 
has created 183,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
In Amparai, 1,005 villagers from Deegawapiya filled the floors at the Gamini 
Maha school. They fled their farms after Tigers shot and killed a woman washing 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"They shot her because she was Sinhalese," said her son-in-law, surprised at 
the question. 
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting also raged Saturday in the northern city of Jaffna, a Tigers 
stronghold where about 400 army troops and police were under siege in a 
17th-Century Dutch-built coastal fort. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels used bulldozers and rocket-propelled grenades to try to break the fort's 
14-foot-thick walls. Helicopters trying to drop food and ammunition to the 
surrounded troops also drew heavy fire, the military said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, army reinforcements had reached Ft. Kiran, near Sri Lanka's east 
coast, where 60 soldiers survived a punishing nine-day siege with little food 
or water. From there, the troops advanced to Batticaloa, a main point of the 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said Saturday that they are making steady progress in that 
eastern region. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pushing them back to the jungle," the army general said. "Now it becomes 
traditional guerrilla war. And that's bound to last for some time." 
</P>
<P>
It already has. After years of unrest, Tamil Tigers first went to war in 1983 
to demand a homeland for Sri Lanka's 3 million Hindus, who make up 18% of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 militants, soldiers and civilians died in subsequent massacres 
and fighting between the Tamils and Sinhalese Buddhists, who make up 75% of the 
population and control the military and government. 
</P>
<P>
An Indian army peacekeeping force arrived in 1987 in an attempt to quell the 
uprising. The force left in March with more than 1,200 Indians dead and a 
fragile cease-fire in place. 
</P>
<P>
Just why the Tigers resumed their war on June 11 is unclear. Analysts say they 
had moved into a political vacuum left by the flight of rival Indian-backed 
Tamil groups and had won vast concessions in peace talks with President 
Ranasinghe Premadasa's government. 
</P>
<P>
"They were given virtual control of one-third of the country," said one 
diplomat in Colombo. "They instituted their own system to tax residents. They 
forbade police from carrying out criminal investigations of Tamils. They got 
the government to relocate police stations and close one army base. They even 
demanded the army ask permission before any troop movements." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the government wanted the Tigers to surrender their arms, drop 
demands for sovereignty and join elections. The Tigers refused and began 
constructing bunkers and stockpiling food and ammunition instead. 
</P>
<P>
"The attacks clearly were premeditated," said another diplomat. "Political 
solutions don't attract them. They believe in military solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst said the problem was more complicated. "You had two armies 
competing on the same terrain," he said. "One had cadres 14, 15 and 16 years 
old. The other was from the government. The relationship was fraught with 
conflict and contradiction." 
</P>
<P>
That was clearly the case in Trincomalee, where a nearly even mix of Tamils, 
Sinhalese and Muslims lived in uneasy peace. Until the Tigers fled on the night 
of June 13, their attempts at civil control in the city won few converts. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no law and order," complained a Roman Catholic shipping agent. "They 
demanded money. They took our vehicles. They went into shops and took what they 
wanted. People were living in fear." 
</P>
<P>
Like others here, he held little hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Since independence in 1948, we've had ethnic problems between Sinhalese and 
Tamils," he said with a sigh. "And I don't think we'll ever solve it. The 
hatred is too deep." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>

Tamil Tigers first went to war in 1983 to demand a homeland for Sri Lanka's 3 
million Hindus, who make up 18% of the population. More than 11,000 people died 
in massacres and fighting between the Tamils and Sinhalese Buddhists, who make

army peacekeeping force arrived in 1987. By the time the force withdrew in 
March, more than 1,200 Indians had died and a fragile cease-fire was in place.

<P>
A government minister said Saturday that student groups were not to blame for 
the riots 10 days ago in Bucharest in which six people died. 
</P>
<P>
In a fresh indication that Romanian authorities are trying to win over their 
critics, Interior Minister Doru Ursu said: "It is more than clear that the 
students of Bucharest were in no way involved in the violent events of June 
13-15." 
</P>
<P>
University buildings were ransacked and students and other people were attacked 
by miners who came to the capital at the request of President Ion Iliescu to 
quell anti-government riots. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, a small crowd barricaded Bucharest's central boulevard on one 
side of University Square, a flash point of the recent violence, in a gesture 
of support for the arrested student leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Police persuaded the protesters to dismantle their barriers and allow traffic 
to pass after about 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ion Ratiu, presidential candidate of the opposition National Peasants Party in 
the May elections, denied on television that his party had anything to do with 
last week's unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ratiu, whose party offices and home were ransacked by the miners, said his 
party was not behind a seven-week demonstration that led to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never given one penny to the people in the square," he said in reply to 
allegations by the ruling National Salvation Front. 
</P>
<P>
"I have also worked by legal methods, never by such means as those used in 
University Square." 
</P>
<P>
Three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross are scheduled 
Monday to start visiting people arrested during the unrest to check on their 
health and conditions of detention. 
</P>
<P>
The ICRC representative in Romania, Thierry Meyrat, said the mission could last 
for months, depending on the timetable for any judicial proceedings against the 
detainees. He declined to answer questions about the number or whereabouts of 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Ursu said he could not discuss individual students but added that "in no way 
can we talk about students' organizations participating in the events (last 
week's violence)." 
</P>
<P>
"I could even go further and say that the students through their calm attitude 
and their whole activity in that period have acted as a factor of 
stabilization."

Pope John Paul II will open the first meeting of Ukrainian bishops in more than 
four decades by receiving each bishop privately, the Vatican said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The change from the Pope's usual opening with the entire group is a sign of 
special concern for the Ukrainian church, which was suppressed by Soviet 
dictator Josef Stalin in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pope wanted to begin with a human rapport," papal spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro said. "They can talk, greet each other, get to know each other." 
</P>
<P>
The meetings with the 10 bishops are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin forced the church to merge with the officially sanctioned Russian 
Orthodox Church, which took control of the property of the Ukrainian church. 
The church wants the return of, or compensation for, the confiscated churches.

NO. 2 EAST GERMAN FACTION OKS JOINT ELECTION THIS YEAR

<P>
East Germany's second-largest political faction Saturday endorsed joint German 
elections in December, greatly increasing the chances that one government will 
be running a united Germany within six months. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's Social Democrats had said earlier that joint elections, and full 
German unification, should not take place until late next year. 
</P>
<P>
Party chief Sabine Riebe said her party will meet with West German Social 
Democrats on Sept. 26 to merge their parties. She proposed all-German elections 
Dec. 16 to replace the West German vote, scheduled for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came a day after the four World War II Allies that fought Germany 
promised to finish their negotiations on unification by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, speaking on West German 
radio, said that move also clears the way for joint elections before year's 
end. Under the laws of both countries, a new Parliament would have to convene 
within 30 days of elections. 
</P>
<P>
The German states are to merge their economies on July 1-2, ending East 
Germany's four decades of socialism. They are also working on a new state 
treaty that would outline the details of merging the two political systems. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany is expected to create a system of states to mirror the federal 
system in West Germany. The country will probably hold state elections in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, it appeared likely that full political unification would not 
take place until late next year. But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl last 
month urged joint elections in December to replace the Dec. 2 West German 
elections. Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats believe they will stand a 
better chance of winning unified elections. 
</P>
<P>
The West German Social Democrats won three important state elections this year 
that were seen as a litmus test for the West German elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democrats of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere overwhelmingly won 
East Germany's first free elections on March 18. The Social Democrats in East 
Germany are members of De Maiziere's broad coalition government. The West 
German Social Democrats, however, are the main opposition group in West 
Germany.

Pope John Paul II will consecrate a controversial basilica in Ivory Coast and 
give his blessing to a hospital that is to be built next to it at his request, 
the Vatican said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope will stop in the West African country on Sept. 10, at the end of a 
10-day African trip that will first take him to Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda, 
papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro, in Ivory Coast's capital, cost about $200 
million, an expense that drew criticism in the poor country. Plans called for 
it to be almost as big as St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, Christendom's largest 
church. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in a private audience with the Pope at the Vatican, President Felix 
Houphouet-Boigny offered the Pope ownership of the church as a gift, Navarro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Accepting this donation, the Holy Father asked that the works carried out be 
integrated with other projects of assistance and social nature on the property" 
next to the church, Navarro added. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital, planned to handle 300 to 400 outpatients a day, will be built next 
to the church, and the Pope, along with consecrating the basilica, will bless 
the cornerstone of the hospital, Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro said that an international foundation will be established to manage the 
site, which the Catholic Church hopes will become a center of pilgrimage for 
African Catholics.

MULRONEY ASKS CANADA TO 'HEAL WOUNDS'; 
</P>
<P>
IMPASSE: THE PRIME MINISTER REJECTS CALLS FOR HIS RESIGNATION AFTER FAILURE OF 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACCORD.

<P>
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called Saturday for restraint in Canada after the 
collapse of a package of constitutional amendments that were supposed to have 
normalized relations between the English and French-speaking provinces. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is not the day to launch new constitutional initiatives," Mulroney said 
in one of his rare, televised formal speeches. "It is a time to mend divisions 
and heal wounds, and reach out to fellow Canadians." 
</P>
<P>
But in a speech of his own in Quebec, Francophone Premier Robert Bourassa 
talked about the end of his involvement in broad-based federal negotiations and 
about the need to draw up a new, as yet undefined, political program. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney directed one part of his address to Canada's "friends and partners 
abroad," urging them to keep the weekend's dramatic events in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Canadians have always overcome challenges to our unity, and we shall do so 
again," he said. "It would be unwise for anyone to underestimate this 
industrious and resource-rich nation of hard-working and productive people." 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney's words were clearly meant to calm international markets, which had 
already closed for the weekend when it became clear late Friday that Canada 
would now be entering a period of constitutional impasse and political 
uncertainty. For months, Mulroney himself has been warning that if the 
constitutional amendments were not ratified, the Canadian dollar might fall, 
and foreign investors might think twice about putting their money into this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Since Friday evening, leading politicians from Canada's two main opposition 
parties have been calling for Mulroney to resign in the wake of the failed 
amendments. Debate over them has polarized public opinion and awakened 
separatist feelings in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe if a new process (of constitution-making) is to have any chance for 
success, the prime minister must step aside in the national interest," said 
Audrey McLaughlin, leader of the social-democratic New Democratic Party, the 
third-largest political grouping in Canada. "I say he must resign." 
</P>
<P>
But in his speech, Mulroney said he has no intention of leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no dishonor in having tried to overcome a serious threat to our 
unity," he said. "I would rather have failed trying to advance the cause of 
Canada's unity than to have simply played it safe, done nothing, or criticized 
from the sidelines. . . . This is not a government of quitters. We will all be 
back at work next week." 
</P>
<P>
There are likely to be more calls for Mulroney to resign in the coming weeks or 
months. Whether he can withstand them will depend in large measure on whether 
he can keep control of his Progressive Conservative Party caucus. Until now, 
the caucus has shown him staunch loyalty even as he plunged in public opinion 
polls -- but it includes numerous Quebecers, and they may now be tempted to 
abandon the prime minister and go back home to work toward sovereignty. Six 
members of Mulroney's caucus have either left or been kicked out in recent 
months, and it will be up to Mulroney now to keep that number from growing. 
</P>
<P>
The constitutional package at the heart of this weekend's events, called the 
Meech Lake Accord, had been intended to woo the province of Quebec into signing 
the national constitution, which it has been refusing to do for years. The 
accord would have given extra powers to all 10 Canadian provinces -- and 
thereby to Quebec -- and would have officially recognized Quebec as a "distinct 
society" within Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The accord ruffled few feathers when it was drafted in 1987, but as the months 
went by before it could be ratified by all 10 provinces, it became intensely 
controversial. The "distinct society" clause was the most disputed element of 
all, with the English-speaking provinces of Manitoba and Newfoundland, in 
particular, arguing that it would be dangerous to give special constitutional 
privileges to Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
It was the legislatures of those two provinces that killed the accord Friday, 
by adjourning without voting to ratify it. By law, all 10 provinces had to have 
approved the accord by Saturday for it to have become law. 
</P>
<P>
But while English Canadians were fuming that the Meech Lake Accord was giving 
too much to Quebec, Francophones in Quebec began to think that for them, the 
accord was too little, too late. Since it collapsed Friday, there has been a 
mood of happy anticipation here in Quebec, with many Francophones hoping that 
the latest turn of events will open a new phase in their relationship with 
English Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours after Mulroney made his remarks, Bourassa addressed his provincial 
legislature in Quebec, holding court in a special chamber reserved for 
important speeches and ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Observers waited keenly for clues to what will happen next in Quebec, but 
Bourassa spoke in very general and relatively moderate terms, leaving 
practically all options open except for one: signing the national constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The process of constitutional reform in Canada has been discredited," Bourassa 
said, vowing that his government would not enter any future talks on the 
subject, however badly other provinces might want them. "How can you expect me 
to return to the constitutional table?" the premier asked. 
</P>
<P>
As for the unanswered question about whether Quebec would begin some sort of 
process of separation from English Canada now, Bourassa merely said that he 
wants to consult with party activists and others, and to develop plans. 
</P>
<P>
"Quebec has the freedom of its choices, and it's going to make its choices in 
realism and calm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that my only goal will be the superior interests of the 
Quebec people." 
</P>
<P>
While Bourassa was speaking in Quebec, Canada's main opposition party, the 
Liberals, were selecting their party leader, the man who will run for 
Mulroney's seat the next time an election is called. Significantly, the 
Liberals elected Jean Chretien, a Francophone Quebecer who opposed the Meech 
Lake Accord and is viewed with contempt in his home province. 
</P>
<P>
Chretien's selection adds even more texture to the complicated political fabric 
now being woven in Canada. When a national election is called, as one must be 
sometime before 1993, it is hard to imagine Chretien carrying the province of 
Quebec. And, however unpopular Mulroney and his Conservatives may be, it is 
hard to imagine any Liberal beating them without carrying Quebec, which has 
about a quarter of the Canadian population and tends to vote as a bloc. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chretien's presence now, as the main alternative to Mulroney in 
Ottawa, may persuade Quebec Conservatives to stick with the embattled prime 
minister in the coming months, rather than jumping ship and heading for Quebec.

Philippine troops arrested a Communist rebel who admitted involvement in the 
December bombing of a U.S. recreational center in Manila, the chief of the 
National Police said Saturday.

Maj. Gen. Cesar Nazareno identified the guerrilla as Jose Llesis and said 
Llesis admitted he was one of eight rebels in a van who fired two rifle 
grenades inside the Seafront sports and recreation facility, about a mile from 
the U.S. Embassy, Dec. 14, 1989. The attack caused minor damage but no

Trucks carried aid into earthquake-stricken Iran on Saturday from Soviet 
Azerbaijan, which observed a day of mourning for victims, the official Tass 
news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent his condolences to the Iranian leadership, 
and the Soviet Red Cross dispatched a plane carrying rescue workers and aid. 
</P>
<P>
In his message to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, Gorbachev expressed his 
"deep condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in 
the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
A report by Tass from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku said an official day of 
mourning was declared in the mainly Muslim republic and that black ribbons hung 
from public buildings in the city. 
</P>
<P>
A column of trucks carrying 100 doctors, 10,000 tons of food, clothing and 
equipment such as welding gear left the town of Nakhicheva near the border. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said people in Azerbaijan, many of whom are Shiite Muslims who feel a 
kinship with people of their faith in Iran, poured money into a public fund for 
earthquake victims. Other volunteers donated blood, it said. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet Red Cross official said a plane left Moscow carrying relief aid, nine 
doctors and rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, a powerful earthquake killed 25,000 people in Soviet 
Armenia, which borders Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, aid continued to pour into Iran from other parts of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
A 205-member French relief team arrived Friday night, according to Iran's 
official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). West Germany said it was sending 
200 tents and 3,200 blankets, to be followed by 100 tons of similar supplies. 
Jordan and Kuwait also said they are sending planeloads of relief aid. 
</P>
<P>
The European Community has granted $1.2 million in emergency aid, and Japan is 
reportedly sending between $500,000 and $1 million in cash as well as a 
22-member medical and rescue squad. 
</P>
<P>
The United States on Friday sent $300,000 worth of relief supplies through the 
American Red Cross and is planning more aid, State Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II was "very saddened" by the earthquake and has donated 
personal funds to help victims of the disaster, the Vatican said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Joaquin Navarro did not specify the amount, but in the past the Pope 
has sent as much as $100,000 for disaster relief from his personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Other assistance reportedly was due from Holland, Turkey, Greece, Pakistan, 
Belgium, Finland, India, Bangladesh, Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka, Kuwait and several 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have said they would welcome aid from all countries except 
Israel and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian officials in Cairo said Iran rejected an Egyptian offer to 
send a planeload of medical supplies. A source at the Foreign Ministry said 
Iran rejected the supplies, saying it needed heavy equipment.

The San Francisco Giants will have to pay rent to the city of Santa Clara if 
they build a stadium on city land, City Manager Jennifer Sparacino said. 
</P>
<P>
The National League team wants to use 120 acres of municipal property -- rent 
free -- to build a 45,000-seat stadium. Sparacino has proposed a $5.4-million 
annual rent. Sparacino gave the Santa Clara City Council a list of 13 
conditions, including one that the team and stadium develop and pay about $60 
million in costs to prepare the stadium site.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
WILSON RALLIES AROUND FLAG BEFORE VETERANS

<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) elicited cheers, whistles and standing ovations 
from two veterans' organizations Saturday with a pledge to fight on for a 
constitutional amendment that would prohibit burning the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
The senator presented his audiences with crisp American flags that had flown 
over the U.S. Capitol, declaring, "I know damn well that no scruffy's going to 
take it away from you and burn it." 
</P>
<P>
In his third post-primary weekend of campaigning for the California 
governorship, Wilson addressed the state convention of the American Legion in 
the upper Sacramento Valley town of Redding. He then flew to the San Joaquin 
Valley town of Visalia to make a similar appearance before the Amvets state 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the U.S. House of Representatives last week effectively killed 
the anti-flag-burning amendment for the year. Wilson vowed to fly overnight 
Monday to Washington so he could cast his vote Tuesday for what he acknowledged 
will be a largely symbolic vote for the Senate's version of the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
And never mind that flag burning has not been an issue high on the California 
state government agenda. Both veterans' groups were well-primed for an 
emotional demonstration on the flag issue. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Wilson is not considered a stem-winding stump speaker, he managed to 
press all the right buttons when he vowed to fight for the flag. And he knew 
his audience. 
</P>
<P>
The previous night, scores of Legionnaires stood respectfully and held hands in 
a cocktail lounge in a Redding hotel as the four-piece combo struck up a jazzy 
rendition of "America" and then slipped into the heavy beat of "Born in the 
USA." Candidates for state Legion offices sprinkled their literature heavily 
with pledges to carry on the crusade against what they perceive to be 
desecration of the flag. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting the flag to the Amvets, Wilson declared: "It represents all that 
you stand for, all that you fought for, all that you hope for -- for your 
children and their children and down through the generations: an America of 
hope and opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson accused the U.S. Supreme Court of engaging in "tortured logic" in 
declaring destruction of the flag a form of freedom of expression. He claimed 
that such action does not constitute free speech, but is "conduct" that he said 
"represents the ultimate obscenity" against those who carried the flag into 
battle for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Legion officials said that Wilson's Democratic opponent, former San Francisco 
Mayor Dianne Feinstein, declined an invitation to address the convention. 
Feinstein generally has shunned public appearances since her June 5 primary 
election victory over state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, while her campaign 
focuses on fund-raising efforts to replenish an empty treasury. 
</P>
<P>
An aide said that Feinstein would favor a constitutional amendment to allow the 
prohibition of flag burning, but one that is more narrowly drawn than the 
version defeated in the House. Feinstein has not decided how such an amendment 
should be worded, the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson brought more than flags to Redding and Visalia. He promised that if 
elected governor, he would work to build more veterans' homes like the one that 
exists in Yountville in the Napa Valley, especially in Southern California, 
home to a majority of the 500,000 California veterans who are 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
He also drew standing applause when he vowed to stop the proposed federal sale 
of "surplus" land at the Department of Veterans Affairs facility in Westwood 
and to get federal funds to repair the VA hospital in Palo Alto, damaged in 
last October's earthquake.

Power utility officials say that they will appeal an appellate court decision 
that could halt operation of a nearly completed $50-million coal-burning 
cogeneration plant in Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
The 5th District Court of Appeal stunned officials of GWF Power Systems Inc. by 
overturning the company's right to operate the controversial coal-fired plant. 
The court ruled that an environmental impact report used by the Hanford City 
Council to approve the project in 1988 was inadequate. GWF, of Walnut Creek, 
had planned to open the power plant in September and provide energy to the 
adjacent Armstrong Rubber Co. tire plant.

LIFE WITH L. RON HUBBARD;

AIDES INDULGED HIS ECCENTRICITIES AND EGOTISM

L. Ron Hubbard enjoyed being pampered. 
</P>
<P>
He surrounded himself with teen-age followers, whom he indoctrinated, treated 
like servants and cherished as though they were his own children. 
</P>
<P>
He called them the "Commodore's messengers." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Messenger!' " he would boom in the morning. "And we'd pull him out of bed," 
one recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters, whose parents belonged to Hubbard's Church of Scientology, 
would lay out his clothes, run his shower and help him dress. He taught them 
how to sprinkle powder in his socks and gently slip them on so as not to pull 
the hairs on his legs. 
</P>
<P>
They made sure the temperature in his room never varied from 72 degrees. They 
boiled water at night to keep the humidity just right. They would hand him a 
cigarette and follow in his footsteps with an ashtray. 
</P>
<P>
When Hubbard's bursitis acted up, a messenger would wrap his shoulders in a 
lumberjack shirt that had been warmed on a heater. 
</P>
<P>
Long gone were those days when Hubbard was scratching out a living. Now, in the 
early 1970s, he fancied silk pants, ascots and nautical caps. It was evident 
that the red-haired author had enjoyed many a good meal. 
</P>
<P>
It was a high honor for Scientologists to serve beside Hubbard, even if it 
meant performing such dreary tasks as ironing his clothes or ferrying his 
messages. But, for some, it was also disconcerting. The privileged few who 
worked at his side saw personality flaws and quirks not reflected in the staged 
photographs or in Hubbard's biographies. 
</P>
<P>
They came to know the man behind the mystique. 
</P>
<P>
They said he could display the temperament of a spoiled child and the 
eccentricities of a reclusive Howard Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
When upset, Hubbard was known to erupt like a volcano, spewing obscenities and 
insults. 
</P>
<P>
Former Scientologist Adelle Hartwell once testified during a Florida hearing on 
Scientology that she saw Hubbard "throw fits." 
</P>
<P>
"I actually saw him take his hat off one day and stomp on it and cry like a 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard had been hotheaded since his youth, when his red hair earned him the 
nickname "Brick." 
</P>
<P>
One of Hubbard's classmates recalled a day in 11th Grade when the husky 
Hubbard, for no apparent reason, got into a fight with Gus Leger, the lanky 
assistant principal at Helena High School in Helena, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Gus was up at the blackboard," recalled Andrew Richardson. "He taught 
geometry. He was laying out this problem and Brick let loose with a piece of 
chalk and he missed him. Leger whirled and threw an eraser at Brick, who 
ducked, and it hit a girl right behind him in the face." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard wrestled with the teacher, then stuffed him into a trash can, said 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
"We all got to laughing and he (Leger) couldn't get up," Richardson said, 
chuckling at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that, while the students helped their teacher, Hubbard stormed 
out and never returned. He left to be with his parents in the Far East, where 
his father was stationed with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
In later life, one thing that could throw the irascible Hubbard into a rage was 
the scent of soap in his clothes. "I was petrified of doing the laundry," one 
former messenger said. 
</P>
<P>
To protect themselves from a Hubbard tirade, the messengers rinsed his clothes 
in 13 separate buckets of water. 
</P>
<P>
Doreen Gillham, who had who spent her teen years with Hubbard, never forgot 
what happened when a longtime aide offered him a freshly laundered shirt after 
he had taken a shower. 
</P>
<P>
"He immediately grabbed the collar and put it up to his nose, then threw it 
down," said Gillham, who died recently in a horseriding accident. "He went to 
the closet and proceeded to sniff all the shirts. He would tear them off the 
hangers and throw them down. We're talking 30 shirts on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
He let out a "long whine," Gillham said, and then began screaming about the 
smell. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked up a shirt off the floor, smelled it and said, 'There is no soap on 
this shirt.' I didn't smell anything in any of them. He grudgingly put it on," 
said Gillham, who added: "Deep down inside, I'm telling myself, 'This guy is 
nuts!' " 
</P>
<P>
Gillham said that Hubbard had become obsessed not only with soap smells but 
with dust, which aggravated his allergies. He demanded white-glove inspections 
but never seemed satisfied with the results. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how clean the room, Gillham said, "he would insist that it be dusted 
over and over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
Gillham, formerly one of Hubbard's most loyal and trusted messengers, said his 
behavior became increasingly erratic after he crashed a motorcycle in the 
Canary Islands in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"He realized his own mortality," she said. "He was in agony for months. He 
insisted, with a broken arm and broken ribs, that he was going to heal himself 
and it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
According to those who knew him well, Hubbard was neither affectionate nor much 
of a family man. He seemed closer to his handpicked messengers than to his own 
seven children, one of whom he later denied fathering. 
</P>
<P>
"His kids rarely, if ever, got to see him," Gillham said, until his wife Mary 
Sue "insisted on weekly Sunday night dinners." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard expected his children to live up to the family name and do nothing that 
would reflect badly on him or the church. And for that reason, his son Quentin 
was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Quentin had once tried suicide with a drug overdose and was confused about his 
sexual orientation -- a fact that was quietly discussed among his friends and 
at the highest levels of the church. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought Quentin was an embarrassment," said Laurel Sullivan, Hubbard's 
former public relations officer, who had a falling out with the organization in 
1981. "And he told me that several times." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Quentin parked on a deserted road in Las Vegas and piped the exhaust 
into his car. At the age of 22, he killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
When Hubbard was told of the suicide, "he didn't cry or anything," according to 
a former aide. His first reaction, she said, was to express concern over the 
possibility of publicity that could be used to discredit Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard also had problems with another son, his namesake, L. Ron Hubbard Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard feuded with his eldest son for more than 25 years, dating back to 1959 
when L. Ron Hubbard Jr. split with Scientology because he said he was not 
making enough money to support his family. In the years that followed, he 
changed his name to Ronald DeWolfe and accused his father of everything from 
cavorting with mobsters to abusing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hubbard accused his son of being crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hubbard cast himself as a humble servant to mankind, former assistants 
said he was not without ego. He craved adulation and coveted fame. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, the former public relations officer, recalled how after an appearance 
he would ask: "How many minutes of applause did I get? How many times did they 
say, 'Hip, hip, hurray!'? How many people showed up? How many letters did I 
get?" 
</P>
<P>
"If you remained in awe of him ... he was great," said Sullivan, who had a 
falling out with the church in 1981. "If you crossed him, or appeared to cross 
him, he would lash out at you, scream at you, accuse you of things." 
</P>
<P>
Gillham and other former aides said he would accuse even his most devout aides 
of trying to poison him if he did not like the taste of a meal that had been 
laboriously prepared for his table. "Somebody's trying to kill me!" former 
aides said he would shout. "What have I done? All I've tried to do is help 
man." 
</P>
<P>
He envisioned global conspiracies designed to smash Scientology, and he 
ingrained this dark view in the minds of his followers through his many 
writings. 
</P>
<P>
"Time and again since 1950," Hubbard said in 1982, "the vested interests which 
pretend to run the world (for their own appetites and profit) have mounted 
full-scale attacks. With a running dog press and slavish government agencies 
the forces of evil have launched their lies and sought, by whatever twisted 
means, to check and destroy Scientology." 
</P>
<P>
"Our enemies on this planet are less than 12 men," he announced in a 1967 
tape-recorded message to his adherents. "They are members of the Bank of 
England and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper 
chains and they are oddly enough directors in all the mental health groups in 
the world which have sprung up." 
</P>
<P>
Chief among his suspects were psychiatry and government agencies that probed 
his organization, including Interpol the Paris-based international police 
agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Internal Revenue Service and 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Former Scientologist Hartwell told the Florida hearing that she was present 
when Hubbard made a film about "bombing the FBI office." 
</P>
<P>
"I was in makeup and we had so much blood on those actors, which was made out 
of Karo syrup and food coloring," Hartwell said. "And we couldn't get enough on 
them to suit Hubbard. We had guys' legs off, there were hands off, arms -- I 
mean, it was a mess from the word go." 
</P>
<P>
Even before Scientology, Hubbard believed that unseen forces were against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched him operate," said "Dianetics" publisher Arthur Ceppos, who later 
split with Hubbard. "If he felt he was under attack, that's when his paranoia 
showed." 
</P>
<P>
This siege mentality led Hubbard to author a series of church policies on how 
to combat suspected foes -- writings that, more than any of his others, have 
worked to reinforce Scientology's cultish image and undermine its quest for 
legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
He counseled his followers to discredit the opposition to "a point of total 
obliteration" and to remember that "the thousands of years of Jewish passivity 
earned them nothing but slaughter. So things do not run right because one is 
holy or good. Things run right because one makes them right." 
</P>
<P>
In this spirit, during the mid-1970s, Scientologists launched nasty smear 
campaigns and turned to criminality, burglarizing private and government 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, 11 top Scientologists were jailed, including Hubbard's wife Mary 
Sue, who oversaw the sweeping operation. Hubbard was named as an unindicted 
co-conspirator. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during this period, FBI agents raided church headquarters in Los 
Angeles and Washington. Hubbard and three trusted aides, fearing that his 
enemies had at long last gained the upper hand, ran for cover. They fled a 
Scientology compound near the town of Hemet and drove to Sparks, Nev., where 
they used false names and lived in a nondescript apartment for six months until 
things cooled off. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the raids happened he never really knew what they (the FBI) had," 
recalled Dede Reisdorf, one of those who accompanied Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
To disguise Hubbard's appearance, Reisdorf said, she cut his red hair and dyed 
it brown. He often wore fake glasses, donned a phony mustache and pulled a 
hunter's cap down over his ears. 
</P>
<P>
"He got to a point," Reisdorf said, "where he wouldn't even walk in front of a 
window. ... He was afraid of being seen by somebody. There was always somebody 
in a bush somewhere. A reporter or an FBI agent or an IRS agent." 
</P>
<P>
It was not the last time Hubbard would go into hiding. In 1980, on St. 
Valentine's Day, Hubbard pulled another disappearing act. This time, he never 
returned.

DEEP IN HIDING, HUBBARD KEPT TIGHT GRIP ON THE CHURCH.

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard often said that man's most basic drive is 
that of survival. And when it came to his own, he used whatever was necessary 
-- false identities, cover stories, deception. 
</P>
<P>
There is no better illustration of this than the way he secretly controlled the 
Church of Scientology while hiding from a world he viewed as increasingly 
hostile. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard was last seen publicly in February 1980, in the desert community of 
Hemet, a few miles from a high-security compound that houses the church's movie 
and recording studio. His sudden departure fueled wild and intense speculation. 
</P>
<P>
The church said Hubbard went into seclusion to continue his Scientology 
research and to resurrect his science fiction-writing career. But former aides 
have said he dropped from sight to avoid subpoenas and government tax agents 
probing allegations that he was skimming church funds. 
</P>
<P>
Publications throughout the world ran stories about Hubbard's disappearance. 
"Mystery of the Vanished Ruler" was the headline in Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Hubbard's estranged son filed a probate petition trying to wrest 
control of the Scientology empire. He argued that his father was either dead or 
mentally incompetent and that his riches were being plundered by Scientology 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was dismissed after Hubbard, through an attorney, submitted an 
affidavit with his fingerprints, saying that he was well and wanted to be left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, Hubbard would have chuckled with satisfaction over the speculation 
surrounding his whereabouts. For he had always considered himself a shrewd 
strategist and a master of the intelligence game, endlessly calculating ways to 
outwit his foes. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard took with him only two people, a married couple named Pat and Anne 
Broeker. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Broeker, Hubbard's personal messenger at the time, had gone into hiding 
with him once before and knew how to ensure his security. Broeker relished 
cloak-and-dagger operations. His nickname among Hubbard's other messengers was 
"007." 
</P>
<P>
Anne had been one of Hubbard's top aides for years. She was cool under pressure 
and able to defuse Hubbard's volatile temper. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard and the Broekers spent their first several years together on the move. 
For months, they traveled the Pacific Northwest in a motor home. They lived in 
apartments in Newport Beach and the suburbs of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the summer of 1983, they decided to settle down in a dusty ranch town 
called Creston, population 270, where the hot, arid climate would be kind to 
Hubbard's bursitis. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 miles inland from San Luis Obispo, it was a perfect spot for a man of 
notoriety to live in obscurity. In those parts, people don't ask a lot of 
questions about someone else's business. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard and the Broekers concocted an elaborate set of phony names and 
backgrounds to conceal their identities from the townsfolk. Pat and Anne 
Broeker went by the names Mike and Lisa Mitchell. Hubbard became Lisa's father, 
Jack, who impressed the locals as a chatty old man, charismatic but sometimes 
gruff. 
</P>
<P>
They purchased a 160-acre ranch known as the Whispering Winds for $700,000, 
using 30 cashier's checks drawn on various California banks. Pat Broeker told 
the sellers, Ed and Sherry Shahan, that he had recently inherited millions of 
dollars and was looking to leave his home in Upstate New York to raise 
livestock in California. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Shahans were suspicious. As Ed Shahan recalled, "They were 
having trouble deciding whose name to put the property in." 
</P>
<P>
In less than three years, Hubbard poured an estimated $3 million into the local 
economy as he redesigned the ranch to his exacting and elaborate 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
He launched one project after another, some of them seemingly senseless, 
according to local residents. He ordered the construction of a quarter-mile 
horse-racing track with an observation tower. The track reportedly was never 
used. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-room ranch house was gutted and remodeled so many times that it went 
virtually uninhabited during Hubbard's time there. He lived and worked in a 
luxurious 40-foot Bluebird motor home parked near the stables. 
</P>
<P>
All this was done without work permits, which meant that Hubbard and his aides 
would not have to worry about nosy county inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hubbard's aides in earlier years, the hired help saw extreme sides of the 
man who was chauffeured around the property in a black Subaru pickup by Anne 
Broeker. 
</P>
<P>
Fencing contractor Jim Froelicher of Paso Robles remembers asking him for 
advice on buying a camera. Several days later, Froelicher said, Hubbard 
presented him with a 35mm camera as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Creston resident Ed Lindquist, on the other hand, said painters 
dropped by the local tavern at lunch to talk about how the "old man" was acting 
eccentric. They said he had them paint the walls again and again because they 
"weren't white enough," according to Lindquist. 
</P>
<P>
Scientology officials insist that Hubbard was in fine mental and physical 
health during his years in seclusion. Most of his days, they say, were spent 
reading, writing and enjoying the ranch's beauty and livestock, which included 
llamas and buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
But Hubbard was doing much more, according to former aides. Even in hiding, 
they say, he kept a close watch and a tight grip on the church he built -- as 
he had for decades. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1966, Hubbard claimed to have relinquished managerial control of 
the church. But ex-Scientologists and several court rulings have held that this 
was a maneuver to shield Hubbard from potential legal actions and 
accountability for the group's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, efforts to conceal Hubbard's ties to the church were extensive 
and extreme. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, for example, a massive shredding operation was undertaken at the 
church's desert compound outside Palm Springs after Scientology officials 
received an erroneous tip of an imminent FBI raid, according to a former aide. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that indicated that L. Ron Hubbard controlled the church or was 
engaged in management was to be shredded," recalled Hubbard's former public 
relations officer, Laurel Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two days, Sullivan said, roughly 200 Scientologists crammed 
thousands of documents into a huge shredder nicknamed "Jaws." Documents too 
valuable to destroy, she added, were buried in the ground or under floorboards. 
</P>
<P>
In his self-imposed exile, Hubbard continued to reign over Scientology with 
almost paranoid secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
He relayed his orders in writing or on tape cassettes to Pat Broeker, who then 
passed them to a ranking Scientologist named David Miscavige, the man 
responsible for seeing that church executives complied. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard's communiques travelled a circuitous route in the darkness of night, 
changing hands from Broeker to Miscavige at designated sites throughout 
Southern California. To mask the author's identity, the missives were signed 
with codes that carried the weight of Hubbard's signature. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Broeker himself appeared from parts unknown to personally deliver 
Hubbard's instructions to church executives. 
</P>
<P>
From his secret seat of power in the oak-studded hills above San Luis Obispo, 
Hubbard also made sure that he would not be severed from the riches of his 
Scientology empire, high-level church defectors would later tell government 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
They alleged that Hubbard skimmed millions of dollars from church coffers while 
he was in hiding -- carrying on a tradition that the Internal Revenue Service 
said he began practically at Scientology's inception about 30 years ago. 
Hubbard and his aides had always denied the allegations, and accused the IRS of 
waging a campaign against the church and its founder. 
</P>
<P>
While Hubbard was underground, the IRS launched a criminal probe of his 
finances. But the investigation would soon be without a target, and ultimately 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
By late 1985, Hubbard's directives to underlings had tapered off. At age 74, he 
no longer resembled the robust and natty man whose dated photographs fill 
Scientology's promotional literature. Living in isolation, separated from his 
devoted followers, he had let himself go. 
</P>
<P>
His thin gray hair, with streaks of the old red, hung without sheen to his 
shoulders. He had grown a stringy, unkempt beard and mustache. His round face 
was now sunken and his ruddy complexion had turned pasty. He was an old man and 
he was nearing death. 
</P>
<P>
On or about Jan. 17, 1986, Hubbard suffered a "cerebral vascular accident," 
commonly known as a stroke. Caring for him was Gene Denk, a Scientologist 
doctor and Hubbard's physician for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
There was little Denk could do for Hubbard in those final days -- the stroke 
was debilitating. He was bedridden and his speech was badly impaired. 
</P>
<P>
One week later, at 8 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 24, Hubbard died. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the night, according to neighbor Robert Whaley, heavy traffic 
inexplicably moved in and out of the ranch. Whaley, a retired advertising 
executive, said that he was kept awake by headlights shining through his 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 11 hours, Hubbard's body remained in the motor home where he 
died. Scientology attorney Earle Cooley had ordered that Hubbard not be touched 
until he arrived by car from Los Angeles with another Scientology lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Cooley telephoned Reis Chapel, a San Luis Obispo mortuary, 
and arranged to have the body cremated. With Cooley present, Hubbard was 
transported to the mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
Once chapel officials learned who Hubbard was, however, they became concerned 
about the church's rush to cremate him. They contacted the San Luis Obispo 
County coroner, who halted the cremation until the body could be examined and 
blood tests performed. 
</P>
<P>
When then-Deputy Coroner Don Hines arrived, Cooley presented him with a 
certificate that Hubbard had signed just four days before his death. It stated 
that, for religious reasons, he wanted no autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley also produced a will that Hubbard had signed the day before he died, 
directing that his body be promptly cremated and that his vast wealth be 
distributed according to the provisions of a confidential trust he had 
established. His once-ornate trademark signature was little more than a scrawl. 
</P>
<P>
After the blood tests and examination revealed no foul play, coroner Hines 
approved the cremation. With Cooley's consent, he also photographed the body 
and lifted fingerprints as a way to later confirm that it was the reclusive 
Hubbard and not a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, Hubbard's ashes were scattered at sea by the Broekers and 
Miscavige. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Hubbard's death, Pat Broeker stood before a standing-room-only 
crowd of Scientologists at the Hollywood Palladium. It was his first public 
appearance in six years, and he had just broken the news of Hubbard's passing. 
</P>
<P>
The cheers were deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Broeker announced that Hubbard had made a conscious decision to "sever all 
ties" to this world so he could continue his Scientology research in spirit 
form -- testimony to the power of the man and his teachings. 
</P>
<P>
He "laid down in his bed and he left," Broeker said. "And that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard left behind an organization that would continue to function as though 
he were still alive. His millions of words -- the lifeblood of Scientology -- 
have now been computerized for wisdom and instructions at the touch of a 
button. 
</P>
<P>
In Scientology, he was -- and always will be -- the "Source."

CHURCH SCRIPTURES GET HIGH-TECH PROTECTION

<P>
Scientology is determined that the words of L. Ron Hubbard shall live forever. 
</P>
<P>
Using state-of-the art technology, the movement has spent more than $15 million 
to protect Hubbard's original writings, tape-recorded lectures and filmed 
treatises from natural and man-made calamities, including nuclear holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
The effort illustrates two fundamental truths about the Scientology movement: 
It believes in its future and it never does anything halfheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
In charge of the preservation task is the Church of Spiritual Technology, which 
functions as archivist for Hubbard's works. 
</P>
<P>
It has a staff -- but no congregation -- and its fiscal 1987 income was $503 
million, according to court documents filed by the church. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has purchased rural land in New Mexico, Northern California 
and San Bernardino Mountains to store the Hubbard gospel. 
</P>
<P>
According to Church of Spiritual Technology documents, the New Mexico site has 
a 670-foot tunnel with two deep vaults at the end. The tunnel is protected with 
thick concrete and has four doors with "maintenance-free lives of 1,000 years." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the doors purportedly will be "nuclear blast resistant." 
</P>
<P>
All this to house mere copies of the original works, which include 500,000 
pages of Hubbard writings, 6,500 reels of tape and 42 films.The originals 
themselves are being kept under tight security on a sprawling Scientology 
complex near Lake Arrowhead.

While details of the facility are sketchy, a San Bernardino County sheriff's 
deputy, who requested anonymity, said the group has burrowed a huge tunnel into 
a mountainside.

At the Arrowhead repository, sophisticated methods are being used to prepare 
Hubbard's works for the bomb-proof vaults. Here, according to Scientology 
officials and documents, is the process: 
</P>
<P>
First, the original writings are chemically treated to rid the paper of acid 
that causes deterioration. Next, they are placed in plastic envelopes that 
church officials say will last 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
From there, they are packaged in titanium "time capsules" filled with argon gas 
to further aid preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard's writings also are being etched onto stainless steel plates with a 
strong acid. Scientology officials said the plates are so durable that they can 
be sprayed with salt water for 1,000 years and not deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
As for Hubbard's taped lectures, they are being re-recorded onto special "pure 
gold" compact discs encased in glass that, according to Scientology archvists, 
are "designed to last at least 1,000 years with no deterioration of sound 
quality." Robert W. Welkos and Joel Sappell

RAIL SYSTEM GETS HEAD START ON SECURITY; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: NEARLY 300 ARRESTS ALREADY HAVE BEEN MADE WITH USE OF 
SOPHISTICATED NETWORK. LINE LINKING LONG BEACH TO DOWNTOWN L.A. DOESN'T OPEN 
FOR THREE WEEKS.

The opening of the $877-million Blue Line light-rail system linking Long Beach 
and downtown Los Angeles is still three weeks away, but a sophisticated 
security network designed to protect passengers and prevent vandalism has 
already led to the arrest of nearly 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
The electronic surveillance equipment and a 118-member rail security force are 
being deployed because of concerns by law enforcement and transportation 
officials about gang activity along the 22-mile line. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got about 15,000, or 22%, of all the gang members in Los Angeles County, 
residing within a mile of either side of the . . . line," said Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Capt. Frank Vadurro, who commands security for the Blue Line. 
"If I were bent on criminal behavior along this line, I would look at our 
enforcement record first." 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made by the rail security force since the system was begun in 
March and provided an early test for the network of roving patrol cars, 
plainclothes officers, closed-circuit televisions and telephone hot lines that 
feed into a command post in Willowbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Suspects taken into custody along the rail line's vacant platforms, stations 
and train tracks have been charged with crimes ranging from possession of 
narcotics and vandalism to malicious mischief and theft. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the gangs will view this system as part of their turf," said 
Sheriff Sherman Block, whose department oversees the rail line's security 
force. "We intend to keep that from translating into vandalism, assault, 
graffiti and anything else against passengers." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department won the job of policing the rail system in March when 
Rapid Transit District directors, under pressure from county supervisors and 
Mayor Tom Bradley, voted to have deputies -- instead of the RTD's own police 
force -- protect the line. The sheriff's involvement will cost the county 
Transportation Commission $9.9 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for RTD officers has expressed reservations about the Sheriff 
Department's ability to handle crimes along the rail line. Transit officers 
said their greatest worry is a stretch between Slauson Avenue and Martin Luther 
King Jr. Boulevard. During the mid-1980s, buses were boarded by armed gangs who 
robbed passengers in incidents that became known as "stage coach robberies," 
said Kyle Ramsey, president of the Southern California Transit Police Officers' 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials downplay these concerns, saying a recent study showed that 
their force and equipment were adequate. 
</P>
<P>
RTD and sheriff's officials will direct the security system from a high-tech 
nerve center that they call the "USS Enterprise," housed in a two-story 
concrete-and-glass structure guarded by a six-foot-high fence. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the command post is a 30-foot-long color coded map that 
shows stations, platforms and the exact location of every train on the line. 
The map faces an array of computer terminals manned by RTD personnel. 
Emergencies will show up on the screen as blinking red or yellow lights -- 
depending on the severity of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
On an adjacent wall are 64 television screens linked to video surveillance 
cameras installed at each of the transit system's 22 station platforms. In the 
trains, passengers will be able to press an intercom button and forward 
emergency calls to train operators. The operators, safe behind locked doors and 
shatter-proof windows, can radio deputies at the command post. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies can even be shuttled to an emergency aboard a special maintenance car 
capable of catching up to a passenger train still in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Response time, said Dan Ibarra, RTD superintendent of light rail operations, 
"will be immediate." 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed deputies and plainclothes officers will ride trains and roam 
stations, platforms and six park-and-ride locations along the route. "Our 
deployment strategy calls for increased presence during peak hours, but I won't 
say there will be an officer on every train," Vadurro said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the chances are great that there will be a deputy riding with you," 
Vadurro said, "and the chances are also great that there will be a plainclothes 
officer on board that you will never know about." 
</P>
<P>
These officers also will be in charge of ensuring that passengers have paid to 
ride the line. Those caught on board without tickets will be subject to fines. 
</P>
<P>
When the trains begin running, some Guardian Angels may be along for the ride. 
A spokesman for the volunteer anti-crime organization said the group hopes to 
put as many as 100 members aboard the trains. 
</P>
<P>
"The Guardian Angels are as welcome as any other citizen to ride these trains," 
said Sheriff's Administrative Sgt. Joe Anda. "In the public's eye, I'm sure 
they will enhance a sense of security."

GIBSON REPORTED TO REQUEST TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: OUTFIELDER WANTS TO LIVE CLOSER TO HIS HOME AND BUSINESS IN DETROIT, 
SOURCES SAY.

Kirk Gibson has requested that the Dodgers trade him because he wishes to play 
closer to his Detroit home. Gibson probably won't sign with the Dodgers when 
his contract expires at the end of the season, two sources close to the team 
have confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The sources, who declined to be identified, say that the Dodgers' recent 
discussions with the Detroit Tigers about a trade are a response to that 
request. A deal with the Tigers, where Gibson played for parts of nine seasons 
before joining the Dodgers in 1988, could be completed as soon as Gibson 
returns to the lineup after recovering from a groin injury, possibly next week. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Tigers have offered veteran pitcher Frank Tanana, but 
that the Dodgers are holding out for an additional pitching prospect, perhaps 
minor leaguer Steve Searcy. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Vice President Fred Claire would neither confirm nor deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
"I have spoken to Kirk and I have spoken to his agent, Doug Baldwin," Claire 
confirmed. "Beyond that, I'm really not going to talk about those 
conversations. I consider those conversations to be in confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said any such trade talk is premature. 
</P>
<P>
Said Baldwin: "Any talk about Kirk being traded is meaningless until he is 
healthy. Anything before that is pure speculation." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gibson: "That's crazy, I am not going to say anything about that. It's 
wrong to be talking about something like that now." 
</P>
<P>
Tanana, who will be 37 July 3, is 5-4 with a 5.01 earned-run average in 14 
starts. He has pitched in parts of 18 major league seasons, all in the American 
League, and could reject a trade because of his veteran status. Dodger scout 
Gary Sutherland has been recently following his progress. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson has a lucrative real estate development business near Detroit, where he 
spends his winters and some days off during the season. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers flew to Cincinnati from Los Angeles for Thursday's day off in 
preparation for a weekend series here, Gibson flew to Detroit. He joined the 
team here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, the National League's most valuable player in 1988, has struggled in 
Los Angeles since leading the Dodgers to the world championship that year with 
his game-winning home run off Oakland's Dennis Eckersley in Game 1 of the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson has played in only 85 games since then, batting 300 times, with a .210 
average and 12 home runs and 36 runs batted in. He has been plagued by injuries 
to his legs. 
</P>
<P>
There also has been trouble off the field. Last year, he and his family were 
robbed at gunpoint outside their Santa Monica home. He has since moved. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said he would not trade Gibson, or any player, simply because they 
requested a trade. But he said he always considers a players' feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"My main intention is always to do what is best for the Dodgers," Claire said. 
"At the same time, I listen to what a player has to say. And I listen to what a 
player's agent says. I consider that very important." 
</P>
<P>
Claire said if Gibson were traded, it should not be construed as the Dodgers 
giving up on the season. With Gibson's replacement in center field, Stan 
Javier, on a 12-game hitting streak, many say a fifth starting pitcher could 
make the Dodgers a contender. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now my only interest is continuing in the direction we are headed, to 
get back in serious contention," Claire said. "We are on that road, and I want 
us to stay on that road."

<P>
SOCCER: MANY TEAMS PLAYED FOR FIRST-ROUND TIES TO BE SAFE FOR SECOND-ROUND 
PLAY.

<P>
A pall of excessive defensiveness hung over the first round of the 1990 World 
Cup. In a deplorable number of games, neither side was really trying to win. 
Notable examples were Spain-Uruguay (0-0) and Romania-Argentina (1-1), and 
nearly all the games between the teams in the F group -- England, the 
Netherlands, Egypt and Ireland. In fact, in the first four games of that group, 
only four goals were scored, and two of the games were scoreless ties. 
</P>
<P>
Modern soccer is a defensive game, but most of the teams in the first round 
carried defense to absurd lengths. In its game with Ireland, England shot in 
the general direction of the goal only five times, and only two reached the 
area of the goal. Costa Rica did not have a single shot on goal in its game 
against Brazil. Nevertheless, there are ways to make the first round more 
exciting. They can -- and should -- be adopted in time for the 1994 World Cup 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive-minded teams attack all over the field, but in the first round only 
the West Germans consistently played the game this way. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, most of the teams withdrew to their half of the field and waited for 
their opponents. Even the Brazilians, known for years for their waves of 
attack, played with only two forwards and four defenders, one of whom hung 
farther back as a sweeper. For all lovers of Brazilian soccer, the team's newly 
defensive posture is disillusioning. It sacrifices inspiration to such an 
extent that Brazil scored only one lucky goal against Costa Rica's 
semiprofessionals. 
</P>
<P>
There are three reasons for the unexciting soccer of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The first is that there are too many weak teams among the 24 who start in the 
World Cup, whose sole hope is to steal a tie. This is a problem that cannot be 
cured without restructuring the two-year tournament that leads to the World 
Cup. No observer of international politics, or for that matter the politics of 
FIFA (the world soccer federation), can reasonably expect this to happen. 
</P>
<P>
The second reason for the inconclusiveness of the first round is the prevailing 
concept of strategy, which is almost exclusively defensive. A defensive style 
can be entertaining, as Cameroon showed with its acrobatics. But the prevailing 
defensive style in the first round was too destructive to the game. 
</P>
<P>
The most important reason for the disappointing first round is the way teams 
are advanced. As it is, only eight teams of the starting 24 are eliminated in 
the first round. Of the 24, two or three or four are usually so weak as to have 
no chance to win or even to tie. The United States and the United Arab Emirates 
are in this category. Another handful -- in this World Cup, Brazil, Germany, 
Italy -- are strong enough to be sure to advance. The rest play for ties. That 
is because teams are given two points for winning a game and one point for 
tying a game. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 teams are divided into six groups of four teams each. Each plays the 
other. Under the scoring system, the top two teams in each group of four 
advance to the second round. The four teams placing third with the highest 
point totals are added to the top 12 to make the 16 of the second round, which 
is the point at which a team that loses a game is eliminated from the 
tournament. For all practical purposes, any team that gets three points -- that 
is, three ties -- advances. 
</P>
<P>
A notorious example was the first-round game between Argentina and Romania. 
Each team was certain to advance if they tied; if one lost, it would be 
eliminated. The result was a predictable 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
A simple procedural change might open up the game for the next World Cup. Let 
only the top two teams from each of the six groups in the first round advance. 
This way a team would have to get four points to be sure to advance. This means 
it would have to win at least one -- and probably two -- games. Have these 12 
play six games, with the winners to advance to the quarterfinals. Add to them 
the two teams with the most goals from the losing six teams. In the case of 
equal goals, the total number of goals in the first round would decide. This 
would guarantee more playing for victory in the first round and better teams in 
each succeeding round. 
</P>
<P>
This would, we think, add greatly to the interest, indeed, to the excitement of 
the tournament, and it would emphasize going for the goal. It would make it too 
dangerous to play for a 0-0 tie in the first round. It would bring back to 
World Cup soccer some of the zest inherent in the game.

<P>
The first 105 minutes of the World Cup's second-round game Saturday between 
Cameroon and Colombia produced only sporadic action and derisive whistles from 
most of the 50,076 spectators, who are accustomed to seeing more creative 
soccer on Diego Maradona's home field. 
</P>
<P>
But those who remained at San Paolo Stadium through 90 regulation minutes and a 
15-minute overtime period of scoreless play were rewarded with a 2-1 Cameroon 
victory and a dramatic finish featuring two of the most intriguing players of 
this or any other World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Within three minutes of the start of the second 15-minute overtime, Roger 
Milla, at 38 the oldest and most indomitable of the Indomitable Lions, twice 
got the best of Colombia's "El Loco" goalkeeper, Rene Higuita, for goals. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Cameroon became the first African team in 60 years of World Cup 
history to advance to the quarterfinals, in a game that took 120 minutes to 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
If Cameroon's success seems improbable considering it entered the tournament as 
a 500-1 longshot, how about that of Milla? 
</P>
<P>
Two years since his second retirement, Milla has four goals in four games and 
was tied with Spain's Jose Miguel Gonzalez -- Michel -- as the tournament's 
leading scorer until Czechoslovakia's Tomas Skuhravy scored three times 
Saturday against Costa Rica to total five. 
</P>
<P>
Performing in his fourth decade after turning professional at 16, Milla, twice 
voted Africa's player of the year, rediscovered his zest for the game -- and 
seemingly his youth -- last season while playing for an amateur team, Saint 
Pierroise, on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion. 
</P>
<P>
But when Milla asked this spring to return to the national team, Cameroon's 
sports minister said the old lion was too long in the tooth. 
</P>
<P>
Milla looked 16 again to the minister when he heard the angry outcry from 
Cameroon's soccer fans. As if it were his idea all along, the minister demanded 
that Coach Valery Nepomnyachy add Milla to the roster. 
</P>
<P>
"Hang up my boots? You must be joking," Milla said before the opening game 
against defending champion Argentina. "I'm a youngster, curious and fascinated 
by the World Cup, and I will show it." 
</P>
<P>
He has proved to be a man of his word. Entering the second game with 32 minutes 
remaining, he scored two goals in a 2-1 victory over Romania that assured 
Cameroon of a second-round berth in only its second World Cup appearance. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, eight years ago in Spain, Cameroon finished with three 
first-round ties -- including one against eventual champion Italy -- but did 
not advance because it did not score enough goals. Milla appeared to score one 
against Peru that would have sent Cameroon through, but it was nullified 
because he was off-sides. 
</P>
<P>
It seems now he can do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer fans here still have not forgiven Cameroon for its stunning 1-0 upset 
victory over Argentina and Maradona, who stars for Naples in the Italian 
league. But they are familiar with Milla's story, as is everyone in the country 
who can read an Italian newspaper, and applaud him when he entered the game 
Saturday nine minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Milla was not immediately accepted back onto the team this spring by some 
players, but he since has become their spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he comes onto the field, he infuses the belief of victory into the 
team," Nepomnyachy said. 
</P>
<P>
After playing a defensive first half to hold off the charging but luckless 
Colombians, Cameroon temporarily showed signs of life on offense with Milla on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
But time after time the Colombians caught the Cameroonians in an off-sides trap 
that left them frustrated, spent and all too willing to sit back on their 
heels. Instead of resuming their attack, the Colombians settled into the same 
tedious pace. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the end did it become clear that either team wanted to win. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute had elapsed in the second 15-minute overtime, when Cameroon 
forward Francois Onam Biyick eluded defender Luis Carlo Perea with a pass 
outside the penalty area to Milla, who dribbled past sweeper Andres Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
Higuita came out to meet Milla but could not throw his body in front of the 
left-footed shot. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rare failure for Higuita. No goalkeeper is as controversial. Few are 
as accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
Voted South America's best goalkeeper last year, he also has received worldwide 
attention for his unorthodox style. He does not remain planted in the goal box, 
preferring to roam with the other defenders as a so-called keeper-sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
With his team down 1-0, Higuita roamed even farther afield than usual in an 
attempt to free his defenders to join the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Milla caught Higuita with the ball far from the goal, stole it with ease and, 
two minutes after scoring his first goal, loped toward an empty net to give 
Cameroon a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia's Valverde Bernardo Redin scored in the 115th minute, five minutes 
from the finish, but Higuita had already sealed his team's doom. 
</P>
<P>
"People will talk about it, and they will be right in talking about it," 
Higuita said. "It was a mistake and everyone saw it. It was as big as a house." 
</P>
<P>
Higuita, 23, said he apologized to his teammates but will not change his 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"No, never," he said. "I've always managed to get away with it. On other 
occasions, I did my job well and was praised. Sooner or later, I had to make a 
mistake. Unfortunately, it happened this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Colombia had temporarily suspended soccer operations in February because of 
death threats against players and coaches related to the country's drug war. 
Also playing in only its second World Cup, it assured itself of a place in the 
second round with a 1-1 tie against potent West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Cameroon will play its quarterfinal game here July 1 against the winner of 
Tuesday's second-round game between England and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
Until 15 days ago, no one would have given Cameroon much chance against either. 
Now, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped the Cameroonians will reach important goals," Colombia Coach 
Francisco Maturana said. 
</P>
<P>
They already have.

ANGELS: MANAGER THROWN OUT AFTER ARGUING CALL IN NINTH INNING OF TEAM'S 9-4 
LOSS TO TIGERS.

The first-base umpire retreated, and Doug Rader followed him. Durwood Merrill 
stepped onto the right-field grass, and Rader, the Angel manager, stepped 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Rader hounded and danced, arguing Merrill's call on Wally Joyner's attempt to 
tag Tony Phillips after he rounded first base in the ninth inning of the 
Angels' 9-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers Saturday night before 50,527 at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
With Merrill's every sidestep, Rader countered, and he was finally ejected. 
</P>
<P>
If only the Angels showed such tenacity in chasing the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of the first pitch, American League West-leading Oakland already 
had lost, and the Angels had a chance to move as close to the Athletics as they 
have been since their season was 24 games old. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels only had to win to move to 7 1/2 games back, and they only had to 
beat Detroit, which had not won at Anaheim since July of 1988, losing nine in a 
row. Rader had gone out to argue with Merrill in the second inning when Devon 
White was called out on a grounder to second that would have loaded the bases. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Phillips singled to right, and Dick Schofield cut off the throw 
trying to get Lou Whitaker at third. Instead, he threw to Joyner, who swiped at 
Phillips as he headed back to the bag after rounding first. Joyner reacted 
angrily to the call, and out came Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"When there's a play and your player or coach has a certain reaction, you have 
to back them up," Rader said. "That's all I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, missing a chance to go four games over .500, wasted two solo home 
runs by Chili Davis, his eighth and ninth homers of the season. 
</P>
<P>
What hurt the Angels the most was an error in center field by White that 
allowed a run to score, and a bases-loaded walk by Willie Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of progressing, the Angels remain 8 1/2 games back in third place. 
</P>
<P>
The last time they were 7 1/2 back was May 5, when they were in sixth place 
with a 10-14 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' failure to gain ground was not the only familiar refrain of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott, the Angel starter, lasted only 4 2/3 innings, giving up five runs 
on seven hits, and extending a winless streak at Anaheim Stadium that stretches 
to last July. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott (4-6) fell behind, 2-0, in the second on an infield hit, a single, a 
double by Lloyd Moseby, and a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
In seven starts at home this season, Abbott is 0-4. His last victory in Anaheim 
came 11 months ago, on July 27 of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I might have tried to do too much in certain situations, trying to 
make the perfect pitch," Abbott said. The Angels trailed only 3-2 after four 
innings, but the game began to get away in the fifth, on White's error and 
Fraser's bases-loaded walk to Scott Lusader, the first batter he faced after 
relieving Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
White's error was similar to one on June 15 in Detroit, when he mishandled a 
ball and allowed the first run to score in a 2-1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
This time, with John Shelby on first after a single, Phillips singled to 
center. White headed for the ball off the bounce, but ran past it, allowing 
Shelby to score. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be one of many runs. Detroit did not lack for offense, but for 
the sixth consecutive game, it did not get a homer from the most likely source 
in the major leagues -- Cecil Fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who singled once in four at-bats, has not added to his 25 home runs 
since Sunday, when he hit a monumental shot off the Angels' Chuck Finley at 
Tiger Stadium. The six-game stretch without a homer equals his longest such 
streak of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit starter Jeff Robinson (6-5) left the game with a 6-3 lead and two out 
in the sixth after Davis hit his second homer and Lance Parrish followed with a 
single. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed three runs on seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel reliever Scott Bailes, struck on the left forearm by a ball hit by Lou 
Whitaker in the ninth, is day-to-day with a bruised forearm. X-rays were 
negative. . . . The Angels' 1-0 victory Friday night on Dave Winfield's 
run-scoring triple in the ninth inning marked the sixth time this season they 
have won in their final at-bat. It was also the fifth time in six games against 
Detroit in Anaheim Stadium that the Angels have won by one run. 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Mark McLemore will have the cast removed from his sprained right 
wrist for it to be examined Monday. McLemore, on the 21-day disabled list since 
June 8 after re-spraining the wrist during a rehabilitation assignment with 
triple-A Edmonton, said he will not try to play until he is confident it is 
healed. "I'm not going to rush it," said McLemore, who was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list with the injury May 17. "I'm not going to try to play with it 
like I did before and re-injured it. This is something that has to be 100%. If 
I fall on it or dive for a ball -- you can't do that." He has played in only 20 
games, fewer than any non-pitcher except shortstop Dick Schofield, who has 
played 15.

Top-fuel drag racer Don Prudhomme of Granada Hills escaped injury when his 
dragster was involved in an accident during qualifying for the NHRA Le 
Grandnational Molson at Sanair International Dragstrip near Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Prudhomme was making his final qualifying attempt when the front end of his 
dragster rose, causing it to flip over. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was Prudhomme's third since the Winston funny-car champion made 
the switch to top fuel at the conclusion of the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
The top qualifiers were Joe Amato (top fuel), Bruce Larson (funny car) and 
Jerry Eckman (pro stock), all of whom set track records. Amato's elapsed time 
was 5.084 seconds with a speed of 272.80 m.p.h; Larson's was 5.382 with a speed 
of 266.19 m.p.h.; and Eckman, of Ventura, had a time of 7.332 and a speed of 
188.00 m.p.h.

Nolan Ryan has bought the Danbury State Bank in Danbury, Tex., 13 miles south 
of his hometown of Alvin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the greatest thing that ever happened to this bank," bank president 
Annette Mandola said. "I can't imagine us working for him." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, a pitcher for the Texas Rangers, purchased the bank, the only one in 
Danbury, a town of 1,500, from a group of investors in the El Campo and Louise 
area in Brazoria County. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price was undisclosed. But the bank has $10.9 million in assets 
and $9.3 million in deposits. And Ryan is the sole owner.

BASKETBALL THE NBA DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
CONTROVERSY, INTEREST CENTER ON SCHINTZIUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is 7-feet-1, an unselfish center with skills that make him a fine passing 
big man and, perhaps, the most talented player in Wednesday's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
But he also has an independent streak, and the general manager who dares pick 
him may find himself fired in a couple years. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the most controversial player in the draft in many years," said Pat 
Williams, president and general manager of the Orlando Magic, of Dwyane 
Schintzius, one-time player at the University of Florida. Williams' club will 
choose fourth and could use a center. 
</P>
<P>
"With all his doings at Florida, there are many questions that surround him," 
Williams said. "Each week brings more. He has been scrutinized, analyzed and 
psychologized for what seems like forever." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, only in earnest since January. Until then, his talent still 
outweighed his seeming immaturity. But when he refused to cut his Andre 
Agassi-like locks and quit the team rather than submit to being disciplined by 
Coach Don DeVoe, he was labeled a discipline problem. 
</P>
<P>
He was gone from the school midway through his senior season, the only player 
in Southeastern Conference history to collect more than 1,500 points, 800 
rebounds, 250 assists and 250 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Were it just for those figures, and considering that talented centers are 
always the prime property of any draft, Schintziuswould been given serious 
consideration as the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time to prove his seriousness about pro ball, when a good 
performance at the Orlando Classic, a postseason competition among many of the 
top draft prospects, could have made him unquestionably the first pick, 
Schintzius showed up grossly overweight at 293 pounds. He blamed it on a bad 
scale, claiming it read 280 at home. 
</P>
<P>
At the final scouting combine workouts, earlier this month at Chicago, his 
weight had dropped, all the way down to 288. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings Schintzius to the present, where people are showing their respect. 
They're laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"He can turn around in a classroom and wipe the blackboard," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the lure of the big man keeps him alive among the top dozen picks, and 
he may go no lower than No. 10, when Golden State, desperate for size, will 
pick. If he is still available at 13, the Clippers, well versed in the ways of 
project centers, may find the talent too much to pass on. They are planning to 
go big with that choice anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Woolf(cq), Schintzius' agent, said his client is the product of overblown 
media stories. Just the same, the drafting clubs seem wary. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody, I'm sure, will take the plunge," said Sacramento personnel director 
Jerry Reynolds, whose Kings will pick seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Asked who it might be, Reynolds broke into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I know who's not going to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of other quality big men means that whatever depth there is in this 
shallow draft is at guard. Starting with Gary Payton going No. 2 to Seattle, 
six backcourt standouts could go in the first 11. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the off guards are Kendall Gill of Illinois, Bo Kimble of Loyola 
Marymount and Travis Mays of Texas. The Clippers, at No. 8, may have their pick 
of Kimble, with better range, or Mays, more versatile with the ability to play 
the point. 
</P>
<P>
Relative unknowns worth knowing about, because the NBA certainly does: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Willie Burton, small forward, Minnesota. Got very little attention outside 
the Big Ten until the NCAA tournament, when he led the Gophers to the East 
Regional semifinals. A great showing at the Orlando scouting combine made his 
stock soar even higher. Now, he may go in the top six and ahead of Lionel 
Simmons, a more publicized player at the same position. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Jamerson, big guard, Ohio University. From the Mid-American Conference 
to the middle of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"He really shoots the ball well," Reynolds said. "Until they change the rules, 
that's important." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Duane Causewell, center, Temple. Washington General Manager John Nash calls 
him the only legitimate shot-blocking center in the draft, enough to draw 
notice in a year devoid of many quality big men. Built the reputation in a 
short time, having missed his freshman year and all but 12 games of the senior 
season because of academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jerrod Mustaf, forward, Maryland. He is going through the draft after his 
sophomore season but being 6-10 tends to make up for a lot of inexperience. 
Besides, he has talent to go with size. 
</P>
<P>
"He is everyone's sleeper," Williams said. "Our mock draft had him going 17 to 
the Knicks. He helped himself dramatically at Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anthony Bonner, forward, St. Louis. While most eyes were on the NCAA 
tournament, Bonner's showing while leading the Billikens to the NIT final was 
more impressive than his finishing No. 1 in Division I in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-area influence will be prominent Wednesday, if not dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
No local players figure to go in the first dozen, Kimble being a Philadelphian, 
but the familiar names will roll after that. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Wilson of UCLA and Cedric Ceballos of Cal State Fullerton, similar 
players in that neither gets much respect for his shooting but is awarded high 
marks for intensity, could go late in the first round. Likewise Derek Strong 
from Xavier by way of Palisades High School, who has caught the interest of 
Phoenix at No. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Others: Scott Williams of North Carolina-Hacienda Heights Wilson, and Elden 
Campbell, Clemson-Inglewood Morningside, both centers in college who may end up 
as forwards in the pros, are in the 20-30 pick range. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Higgins, Michigan-Fairfax, has fans after a good showing at Chicago, but 
would have more if he had waited a year and come out as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Thompson is followed by the same concerns as when he went from Crenshaw 
to Syracuse, that, at 6-3, he has the size of a guard without the shooting 
touch to play the position. 
</P>

HIGH SCHOOL COACHES TAKE GLIMPSE AT THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although high school athletes were the focus of the 23rd L.A. Games at El 
Camino College Saturday, coaches may have been the real beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
They got a chance to look at the future. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Olympic-style competition, sponsored by the Los Angeles Junior 
Chamber of Commerce, is held over the last two weekends in June and involves 
more than 10,000 Southern California athletes. The high schools bring players 
who have yet to graduate, and the competition provides off-season insight into 
problems coaches will see in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Head coaches Paul Knox and Gene McAdoo of last year's City 4-A football 
champion, Dorsey High School, saw some of the past in a passing-game victory 
over Carson, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
"We had played them close since 1985, but got a few bad breaks in those close 
games. . . . Our kids always believed we could win it," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
The games originated after the 1965 Watts riots and allow athletes to compete 
with those from other cultural backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada girls volleyball Coach Bobbie Estas has extra incentive, even if she 
will get no insight. 
</P>
<P>
"The games mean a lot to me because I'm leaving the school (to teach at Saugus 
High)," Estas said. 
</P>
<P>
Estas is finishing her 13th year as head coach for the Spartans. It's kind of 
like our farewell performance because two of the players are moving out of the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Estas teaches in the Regional Occupational Program. 
</P>
<P>
In their first match Saturday, La Canada defeated defending Southern Section 
3-A champion Arcadia, 14-12, 9-11, 12-10. 
</P>
<P>
Estas says this was a big victory because her team practiced only a few days 
before the competition, and the Spartans lost a few strong players to 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times you're here competing without some of your key players," Estas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada has been dominant in the Rio Hondo League for the past few seasons, 
partly because of the dedication of such players as senior setter Kim Tibbets, 
who plays with a hearing impairment. 
</P>
<P>
Tibbets, who is legally deaf, is a returning varsity player relying on her 
visual ability while concentrating in a game. 
</P>
<P>
"She turns off her hearing aides before she plays," Estas said.

DUVALL IS WINNER AT MARINA DEL REY

Bob Nordskog is a 77-year-old powerboat racer who has invested his lifetime in 
the sport. His red, 40-foot craft is serviced by a hand-picked cast of some of 
Southern California's most knowledgeable boat mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
For all his careful orchestration, a blown piston and an unexpected mishap with 
the boat's kill switch slowed him in the stretch, and Jim Duvall won the 
overall title at Saturday's 10th Annual Marina del Rey Race for Sight. 
</P>
<P>
Duvall, last year's overall champion, has won two of the three overall titles 
this season. Duvall and Nordskog, averaging speeds of 85 m.p.h., distanced 
themselves from the other drivers at the start of the race and were more than 
four minutes ahead of the 30-boat field at the midway point. 
</P>
<P>
The race began a mile off the Marina del Rey breakwater and went to Redondo, 
Point Dume, Santa Monica and back to Marina del Rey, with the larger boats 
(30-40 feet, with larger engines) completing the course twice. 
</P>
<P>
Duvall, racing in his 30-foot "Crimson Tide," was leading Nordskog by about 80 
yards at the midway point. But Nordskog, driving his 40-foot Fountain, said he 
knew he could catch up in rougher water. 
</P>
<P>
A kill switch connects the driver to the boat and comes into play in the case 
of an emergency. If the driver falls out of the boat, the engine turns off. 
</P>
<P>
Nordskog lost some time when it went, but nothing he probably couldn't have 
made up. 
</P>
<P>
The crippling blow came a few seconds later when a piston blew, causing oil 
leakage and lowered oil pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to back off or we wouldn't have finished," Nordskog said. 
</P>
<P>
In the overall category, Duvall finished the 140-mile course in 1 hour 35 
minutes, followed by Nordskog in 1:37 and Kal Koster in 1:51.

 Damon Bradshaw and world 250cc champion Jean-Michel Bayle gave 40,062 
motocross fans a thrilling finish Saturday night in the Camel supercross season 
finale in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, 17, from Charlotte, N.C., almost lost control of his bike on the 
final jump before the finish line and as he started up the final steep hill to 
the checkered flag, he was more off than on his Yamaha 250cc bike. 
</P>
<P>
Bayle, a Frenchman who lives in Redondo Beach, was only inches behind at the 
end of the 20-lap finale after charging from 11th place early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Stanton, defending supercross champion from Stanton, Mich., won his second 
consecutive title by finishing sixth in the main event. He had led at the 
start, but gave way to Bradshaw on the fifth lap. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost threw it away a couple of times, so I decided to back off and make 
sure I finished high enough to win the championship," Stanton said. Stanton, 
who had to finish ninth or better to clinch the championship, won $50,000 bonus 
for retaining the No. 1 plates. 
</P>
<P>
Bayle's dash to the front, during which he picked up one rider after another on 
each lap, edged past Bradshaw heading up the hill at the peristyle end of the 
Coliseum on the final lap. However, Bradshaw passed him coming back down the 
hill and held him off in the final run around the perimeter of the football 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I never ran so hard in my life to stay ahead of anyone," Bradshaw said. "I 
felt pretty good when I got back by him, and I thought I had it won, but then I 
almost screwed up. I think I was on the bike, but I'm not sure about anything. 
I was just hanging on and hoping I made it to the finish line." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw had won the first two races at Anaheim and Houston, but he suffered a 
broken ankle in the third race at San Diego and missed several races that kept 
him out of championship contention. 
</P>
<P>
Bayle, who had won six races this season in his first stadium motocross season, 
said he thought he had his seventh victory when he got past Bradshaw with less 
than a lap to go, but "he's an awful tenacious guy and I couldn't quite make it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kiedrowski of Canyon Country finished third with Johnny O'Mara fourth. 
Veteran Jeff Ward was fifth despite riding with an injured ankle. He passed 
Stanton on the final lap. 
</P>
<P>
Ward dedicated the race to Patrick Lease, 15, of Hudson Valley, N.Y., a 
Hodgkin's disease patient who was flown to the race by the Make a Wish 
Foundation. Lease, a motocross enthusiast, had said his wish was to see the 
race and meet Ward. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton ended up with 329 points to 322 for Bayle in the season standings. Jeff 
Matiasevich, who finished seventh Saturday, was third with 308. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Emig, 19, won $10,000 in the Camel Shootout for 125cc riders from the East 
and West coasts. Emig was an easy winner after his only serious challenger, 
Buddy Antunez of Ontario, fell after hitting a hay bale on lap 13 of the 15-lap 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Antunez earlier had won the final Western regional race. Ty Davis of Hesperia 
finished 10th to clinch the West Coast championship, but he fell on the first 
lap of the shootout. The Eastern champion, Denny Stephenson of Omaha, missed 
the race after falling and suffering a wrist injury during afternoon practice.

<P>
PLAYWRIGHT LEE BLESSING TAKES A CONTEMPORARY LOOK AT TY COBB, ONE OF OUR 
MISUNDERSTOOD SPORTS HEROES

<P>
"Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?/A nation turns its lonely eyes to you," 
sang Simon &amp; Garfunkel in the 1967 movie, "The Graduate." The nation has 
always turned its lonely eyes on sports figures, finding in their strength and 
grace and record-setting effort a metaphor for a kind of miraculous human 
transcendence, of momentary, improbable perfection and renewed possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The triumph of sports heroes is greeted with a gut adulation once reserved for 
homecoming war veterans or liberating troops. We confer on them a mythic status 
in renaming them. Joe Louis was called The Brown Bomber. DiMaggio was The 
Yankee Clipper. Of all the Johnsons who play in the NBA, there's only one 
Magic. 
</P>
<P>
We occasionally go so far as to call them immortal. But sometimes even 
immortals become encrusted with the despoliation of our neglect, like a statue 
in the park. Playwright Lee Blessing has polished off one such figure in his 
new play "Cobb," an examination of the baseball great of early 20th-Century 
America, Ty Cobb. The play, directed by Lloyd Richards, has its West Coast 
premiere at the Old Globe Theatre Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Ty Cobb did for baseball what Sherman did for the popular conception of war," 
Blessing said. "He turned it into a game played for keeps and created a 
definition that prevailed. Cobb set 123 baseball records in his career. Of 
these, 15 still stand. Yet, he's most famous for his spiking incidents. When he 
played in Philadelphia, he needed police protection. One of the reasons I 
wanted to write about him was that most people sentimentalize baseball, and he 
wasn't sentimental at all. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a multidimensional human being, one of the most successful baseball 
players who ever lived," Blessing continued. "Yet he was not what you'd call an 
integrated personality. He played for the Detroit Tigers from 1905 to 1926, and 
finished out his last year in 1928 with the Philadelphia Athletics, where he 
batted .323. He invested in Georgia cotton and in Coca-Cola, all before 1920, 
and was a multimillionaire when he died in 1961. He played poker with 
Presidents. He raced sports cars. He acted in vaudeville and in a movie. Before 
Babe Ruth came along, Cobb dominated the game, but he brought it a different 
image. He was the meanest man in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Blessing, who is one of our more gifted playwrights (he's best known for "A 
Walk in the Woods"), has his work cut out for him. For one thing, the theater, 
which traditionally deals with a key attribute of heroism -- the stratagems of 
conflicting desire -- hasn't had much to do with the world of sport. You would 
think otherwise, particularly in an age in which most authority is ritually 
discredited and the glow of empty celebrity outshines the arduous struggle 
towards authentic greatness (as opposed to fame). 
</P>
<P>
Yet they're amazingly similar. Both involve spectacle and performance. Both 
play. Both involve character having to improvise its way through duress. On 
stage, Hamlet falls in an eternal flash of self-illumination. In sport, Kirk 
Gibson limps to the plate, two out, bottom of the ninth in a crucial World 
Series game and knocks one out of here into history's everlastingly watchful 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Was it Pat Riley or Arthur Ashe who observed: "Your career moves through 
categories. The first is when you're unknown and have to prove yourself. The 
second is when you're there, performing consistently, being recognized. The 
third is when people put their memory on your head; they expect you to win. 
You've lost the element of surprise. It's you and them all the time. You're 
seen from the top of your head to the bottom of you. You've got to work all the 
time to find your rhythm"? 
</P>
<P>
Guess again. It was Derek Jacobi, when he came to the Los Angeles Olympic Arts 
Festival in 1984 with the Royal Shakespeare Company and discussed his life as 
an actor. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the obvious difference in intent (the theater allegorizes, the 
contest offers a discrete physical proof) there is the problem of setting and 
scale. George M. Cohan's 1904 "Little Johnny Jones" gave us the songs "Give My 
Regards to Broadway" and "Yankee Doodle Dandy," but what is little Johnny's 
vindication compared to the demonic sight of Secretariat thundering down the 
stretch at the 1977 Belmont Stakes with such purposeful, solitary fury that the 
mind shivers in recollection? This after his pedigree suggested he'd finish out 
of the money. 
</P>
<P>
What's Joe Bonaparte's conflict over whether to box or play the violin in 
Clifford Odets' 1937 "Golden Boy" compared to the figure of Muhammad Ali 
sitting night after night by the Kwango River 40 miles outside of Kinshasa, 
Zaire, and drawing the ancestral spirits of Africa out of its mists to protect 
him against the fearsome power of undefeated heavyweight champion George 
Foreman? (Ali, miraculously, not only won the fight but knocked Foreman out). 
</P>
<P>
Ali in fistic exile made a charmingly good account of himself as an actor in 
the 1969 Broadway production, "Big Time Buck White." It was a good play. But 
Ali in the ring was great theater. 
</P>
<P>
James Earl Jones was a stylish, impassioned and powerfully bitter Jack 
Jefferson (the Jack Johnson surrogate) in Howard Sackler's 1968 "The Great 
White Hope," but sight of the younger Mike Tyson climbing into the ring was so 
menacingly primeval that he could pump his bad intentions through 10 million TV 
sets into the viscera of anyone who watched. 
</P>
<P>
Blessing has mixed feelings about it all. He remembers a certain resentment he 
felt when he wanted people to come see one of his plays in Minneapolis and 
instead they went to hang on the fate of the Twins in the '87 World Series. 
Nonetheless, "Cobb" generates both out of an early interest (one of his first 
plays was called "The Old Timers Game") and a more mature dexterity at 
expressing himself on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be able to deal with Cobb in a panoramic sense. You'll see him at 
ages 19, 41 and 75, when he's suffering from terminal cancer. All three 
characters are on stage at the same time and even argue with each other. It's a 
one-man play for four men -- there's also the character of Oscar Charleston, a 
black player from the '20s who, in the opinion of some, was the best baseball 
player who ever lived. Cobb didn't like blacks. He avoided them, even in 
exhibition games. This was a reality of sports at the time, and I think we're 
still the heirs of that old racism." 
</P>
<P>
Blessing knows as well as anyone that there there was a time in history when 
the theater was an arena of propitiation; what happened on stage as a 
meditation on destiny, morality and conscience held meaning just as suspenseful 
and infinitely more resonant than a tie-breaking shot at the buzzer. The fate 
of nations spooled out of the inner machinations of their kings, laid out on 
stage like the workings of a watch. 
</P>
<P>
It's sport now that holds the intensity of our interest, perhaps because we've 
come to conclude that there's nothing out there in the darkness that surrounds 
us after all, and conversely, the 20th-Century human heart doesn't bear looking 
into either. 
</P>
<P>
Too, if the general porousness of theater doesn't absorb the athlete as 
cynosure, a lot of that is owed to the athlete himself, or herself. Oscar Wilde 
said he put his genius into his life and his talent into his work. Most great 
athletes put their genius into their game and a rudimentary, functional residue 
into whatever is left. The majority of them never grow up, even if they want to 
(isn't that what "That Championship Season" was all about?). There are 
relatively few Jack Kemps and Bill Bradleys out there. F. Scott Fitzgerald said 
it well in his essay on Ring Lardner when he talked about the coming-of-age 
mind-set of the athlete: 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine life conceived as a business of beautiful muscular organization -- an 
arising, an effort, a good break, a sweat, a bath, a meal, a love, a sleep -- 
imagine it achieved; then imagine trying to apply that standard to the horribly 
complicated mess of living, where nothing, even the greatest conceptions and 
workings and achievements, is else but messy, spotty, tortuous -- and then one 
can imagine the confusion that Ring faced on coming out of the ball park." 
</P>
<P>
Still, if sport is a kind of courtroom of effort, the theater remains one of 
our best arenas of inquiry in teasing out universals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fascinated with Cobb's all-or-nothing attitude towards winning," 
Blessing said. "After I read Charles Alexander's biography of Cobb in '85, I 
realized there were a lot more complex patterns in him than we normally see in 
baseball. His marriages ended bitterly. He wound up estranged from his son (he 
had five children). I think he felt a great anger over the form of baseball 
becoming decadent. He came along at a time before the the power game became 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
"Why he was the way he was I don't know. Coming from Royston, Ga., he was a 
young Southerner -- 19 years old -- breaking into a game dominated by Irishmen 
from the Northeast. Nobody there wanted to see a new face, and it didn't help 
that he had absolutely no interpersonal skills. Also, a terrible thing happened 
three weeks before he went to Detroit -- his mother killed his father under 
highly mysterious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"Cobb is a different kind of legend, and we see how it hits him that the 
audience is trying to forget him. We tend to repress what we don't like, even 
the memory of someone's achievements. The play is about his struggle to be 
remembered. It asks, 'What's the meaning of the life of a human being?' He was 
almost a prototype of someone who could do nothing wrong, yet when he lost his 
temper, he was a dangerous man." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's a clue. In our own spiritually dislocated time, the best we can 
usually do in the theater is manage a semi-abstract empathy with characters, 
and maybe learn from them. In sports, we wince when people get hurt. In both, 
we witness pain (even in comedy; especially in comedy). It has become our 
nature now to hover around immediacy. Into the breach between the darkness of 
individual character and the light of collective observance steps the artist. 
In retrospect, and in the right hands, Ty Cobb's flashing spikes and Henry V's 
flashing sword are one and the same after all.

NYCB GIVES WING TO A ROBBINS FEST; 
</P>
<P>
THE METICULOUS CHOREOGRAPHER, AT 71, DISPLAYS 27 OF HIS WORKS AT A NEW YORK 
CELEBRATION. HIS SENSE OF INVENTION NEVER QUITS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerome Robbins came of artistic age during the '40s, when George Balanchine was 
active as founding father of ballet in America. Early in his dance career, 
which began in musical theater, Robbins attracted Balanchine's attention. In 
1949, the variously trained, New York-born dancer and aspiring choreographer 
joined Balanchine's New York City Ballet, where he happily viewed the 
Russian-born ballet master as a kind of father figure. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 40 years later, Robbins stands less as son of Balanchine and 
more as godfather of the American ballet his mentor so effectively championed. 
</P>
<P>
The extent and nature of Robbins' influence on City Ballet in particular and on 
contemporary American classicism in general, was substantially illustrated 
recently when the company where he has consistently, if not exclusively, 
worked, held "A Festival of Jerome Robbins' Ballets." 
</P>
<P>
For two weeks an all-Robbins repertory was given: 27 ballets, plus one excerpt, 
arranged into nine different programs. All of the ballets were supervised and 
personally rehearsed by the legendarily meticulous master himself, who will be 
72 in October. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," the fairly comprehensive retrospective of 
Robbins' dance work for musical theater, this festival involved few 
reconstructions of works no longer in repertory. For his critically acclaimed 
1989 Broadway extravaganza -- 20 shows documented in one two-act presentation 
-- the ever-scrupulous Robbins worked for an unusually long preparation period, 
including 22 weeks of rehearsal. For this showing of ballets, largely taken 
from active roles, Robbins worked for about 12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even while creating a festival of mostly recent repertory, Robbins 
revealed his uncanny gift for arranging novel theatrical effect. This one-man 
show included multiple viewpoints from which to get a fresh take on one man's 
influential aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
For chronological neatness, there was Robbins' first ballet, "Fancy Free," from 
1944 for American Ballet Theatre, programmed back-to-back with his last, "Ives, 
Songs," from 1988 for City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
For a range of experimentation, the schedule included another kind of yin and 
yang. At one end was the only full-scale reconstruction, that of the 1972 
"Watermill," an exploration of tableau-like, Asian theater effects, which 
hadn't been performed since 1979. On the other side was "Brahms/Handel" (1984), 
the stirring and yeasty result of a rare collaboration between Robbins and 
another choreographer -- in this case the unpredictable Twyla Tharp. 
</P>
<P>
Enlivening the array of ballets were the dancers Robbins had specially chosen 
to give wing to his works. The range here was similar to the breadth of his 
choreography. At one side was the legendary Edward Villella, 53 years old and 
out of retirement especially for the revival of "Watermill." Contrasting such 
senior artists were fresh-faced underlings, such as the young and gifted Brian 
Reeder and the still-younger and prodigiously talented Ethan Stiefel. 
</P>
<P>
The overall shape of the event itself was appealingly clean and clear. Its 
proceedings were notably free of special-event excesses such as banners, 
posters, speeches, and other extra-dance activity. Only with the final 
performance last Sunday night did a certain party atmosphere arise to cap two 
weeks of regular Robbins dancing with two hours of gala Robbins dancing. 
</P>
<P>
This closing affair included guest casts from two other ballet companies 
performing two works not seen elsewhere in the Festival. Three stellar couples 
from the Paris Opera Ballet danced "In the Night," a rapturously impassioned 
and intense reading of some Chopin nocturnes. A contingent from American Ballet 
Theatre lead an excerpt from "Les Noces," the choreographer's foot-pounding 
staging of one of Igor Stravinsky's most percussive cantatas. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, both these guest groups added excitement and richness to the 
festival. Both the Paris and Ballet Theatre dancers, particularly the men, 
unsparingly committed themselves to Robbins' inventions. They made up in 
theatrical impact what they sometimes lacked in technical finesse. As they 
threw themselves into their material, you could almost hear their 
host/taskmaster prodding, as he is sometimes said to do at his infamous 
rehearsals: "Come on, baby, give it to me!" 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, however, it was in the day-to-day course of these events that the 
special colors, connections and consistencies of Robbins' repertory shone most 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
Bubbling to the surface were flashes of Robbins' trademarks. The dominance in 
his work, for instance, of the art of the male dancer. Robbins came into 
Balanchine's European world of ballet -- where "Woman" is supreme and "Man is 
to serve" -- as an American familiar with musical theater -- where "boy meets 
girl." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' "boys" have a way -- even while being ever-deferential to their 
"girls" -- of stealing the show. And they did so in almost half of the 27 
works. 
</P>
<P>
While the repertory certainly had its share of women's parts and feminine 
force, such dimensions remain secondary in Robbins' canon. If there was a 
general weakness to the casting of these ballets, it was his selection of 
ballerinas. 
</P>
<P>
The generally uneasy showing made by "Dances at a Gathering," the landmark 
Chopin ballet that brought Robbins back to City Ballet and back to classical 
choreography in 1969, was most weak in ballerina dimension. 
</P>
<P>
The ballerinas in today's cast of "Dances" and in related works, who had 
substantial Balanchine tutelage to their credit, were almost all past peak 
form. Those who didn't were strikingly of another and lesser dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking of its origin, when Robbins had choice pick of the female artists 
Balanchine was so deft at creating, gave one pause. Perhaps now that the 
master-teacher who died in 1983 is no longer turning out ballerinas -- Robbins 
has never seen himself as a pedagogue -- the eagle-eyed dance-maker finds less 
and less inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
However, even given the isolated instances of less-than-rigorous individual 
dancers, these performances were fortified by theatrical effects so savvy, no 
work fell utterly flat. Robbins-the-showman has given ballet its very own 
version, in almost infinite variety, of the musical theater's "button" -- that 
definite sign, by way of some kind of flourish, to tell the audience it's time 
to applaud. For example, the high-flown lift that frequently ends a Robbins pas 
de deux: "Dances at a Gathering" and "In the Night" are mini-texts on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
If Robbins' vision can be said to have something of a theme, these samplings 
would suggest "theme and variations" -- Robbins' sense of invention is not only 
keen, it just doesn't quit. See the variations on seating mishaps that take 
place around a table of beers as the three gobs in "Fancy Free" try to put the 
make on their none-too-easily-impressed dates. Or watch the variety of umbrella 
openings and closings in the almost-Zen landscape of strolling bumbershootists 
in "The Concert." Or, note the continual adjustments of similar pose and 
gesture that make up the women's pas de quatre in "Moves." Here, in this 1959 
study of dancing in silence, lie the fertile seeds that gave rise to the 1984 
"Antique Epigraphs," with its less succinct and more labored conceit for eight 
women, relentlessly posturing a la Grecque. 
</P>
<P>
As our ballet's clever and loyal godfather, Robbins has, true to tradition, 
been a compelling storyteller. Early in his career, when a libretto was 
standard ballet procedure, Robbins told his stories plainly but poetically. 
Later on, in good part due to the lessons and convictions of Balanchine, the 
libretto and its predetermined storyline were no longer required. This freedom 
has led willy-nilly to some free-license floundering and unfocused theatrics 
around the dance world. Robbins, however, took the cue. He refined his poetic 
work by inventing more with academic dance than with character gesture. In the 
process, he continued to work for character, without creating characters. 
</P>
<P>
In "Fancy Free," Robbins used the pretext of three sailors showing off to 
create three male variations out of classical dance material. In "Ives, Songs" 
he used the pretext of dance set to compositions by Charles Ives to create a 
portfolio of vignettes depicting early 20th Century Americana. 
</P>
<P>
The more things change, the more Jerome Robbins remains the same.

Louie Cordero grew up in Orange County, reading his mother's copies of Hit 
Parader magazine and listening to a bedroom radio tuned each week to the 
"American Top 40" countdown. 
</P>
<P>
Now, under the stage name Louie Louie, Cordero is on the hit parade himself. 
"Sittin' in the Lap of Luxury," the first single from the 25-year-old dance-pop 
singer's debut album, "The State I'm In," has moved quickly to No. 27 on the 
Billboard pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
The song, which tells the story of a gigolo who finds true romance, is the 
first tangible success in Louie's focused, concerted quest to make it big. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I need gratification constantly. (Stardom) is the most incredible 
thing that could ever happen to somebody," said the handsome, athletically 
built singer. "Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be on TV or in the movies. 
It attracted me because if you're familiar to everybody in the world, it seems 
safer. I don't think people know me unless they see me perform." 
</P>
<P>
Louie's quest to be known began in Southern California dance clubs, where his 
reputation as a flashy teen-age dancer landed him the role of leading man in 
the video for Madonna's 1984 song "Borderline." Louie says that Madonna and her 
managers were the first people in show business to encourage him to sing and 
write songs. 
</P>
<P>
He was let down by some early setbacks, but made the best of them. "I kind of 
like to fail," he noted. "You have to have a lot of humbling experiences, 
because then you know where you come from." 
</P>
<P>
Louie wrote or co-wrote all of "The State I'm In," moving beyond dance-pop 
cliches in songs like the gospel-funk title track, a spirited, propulsive 
rallying cry for positive change that recalls Prince's style. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can write a song about pushing to the groove, or moving to the beat," 
Louie said. "I don't think songs about sex and dancing are enough. There should 
be a lesson in every song." MIKE BOEHM

POP FACES: WHETHER THE STYLE'S GOSPEL OR SOUL MARIAH CAREY SINGS A HEAVENLY 
SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Mariah Carey is an extraordinary gospel singer -- blessed with both a 
remarkable command of her upper register and the ability to invest a song with 
gut-wrenching passion. Unfortunately, though, she doesn't sing much gospel. 
</P>
<P>
Her just-released debut album, "Mariah Carey" on Columbia, is primarily 
pop-soul. The first single, "Vision of Love," shot up into the Billboard Top 40 
in just a few weeks -- impressive for a singer who was totally unknown a month 
ago. But it's Carey's gospel-style singing that gives this album its real 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
In town recently to film a video, the 20-year-old New Yorker insisted, with the 
utmost sincerity, "I'm not really good enough to sing gospel. I'm not in a 
league with those really good singers." 
</P>
<P>
She'd get a strong argument from the millions who saw her knockout gospelized 
version of "The Star-Spangled Banner," televised from the opener of the 
Pistons-Trail Blazers basketball championship series. 
</P>
<P>
Like Taylor Dayne and Lisa Stansfield, Carey is a white singer who has a black 
vocal style. Carey, though, is the best of the lot, with range and power not 
heard perhaps since Jennifer Holliday surfaced in the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
Dance-music artist Brenda K. Starr, who hired Carey as a backup singer, 
orchestrated her big break. At a party two years ago, Starr slipped Carey's 
demo tape to CBS Records president Tommy Mottola, who was so impressed by her 
voice that he offered her a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Raised in New York by her mother -- an opera singer and vocal coach -- Carey 
was turned on to singing as a toddler. "I wanted a career as a singer before I 
was old enough to know what a career is," she quipped. 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Carey thrived on jazz, R&amp;B and especially gospel. "Great 
gospel singing gives me chills," she said, shivering to emphasize her point. 
"There's so much passion and fire and spirit in it. It comes from way down deep 
inside. When the good gospel singers sing, they soar. I wish I could soar like 
that." DENNIS HUNT

A FAMILY FIRM MAKES ROOM FOR JAPANESE PARTNER; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THE BIRTCHERS HAVE BEEN CONSERVATIVE IN BUILDING A $3-BILLION 
EMPIRE ON THEIR OWN. AN ALLIANCE WITH MITSUI BRINGS A FAT CHECKBOOK AND NEW 
FACES IN MANAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
From a rise just before Birtcher headquarters you can see a valley spread out 
like a map. The hillsides have been denuded by bulldozers, and off to the right 
new houses crouch cheek by jowl, so close you can almost reach out the living 
room window and touch a neighbor's wall. 
</P>
<P>
Most Orange County land barons prefer the sleek glass office buildings and 
fashionable addresses of Irvine and Newport Beach. But the Birtcher family runs 
its $3-billion real estate empire from an unassuming collection of low-slung 
buildings across the street from a shopping center in a suburb so new that it 
incorporated only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This prosperous suburban county tends to lionize the flamboyant entrepreneurs 
who built its vast subdivisions, office towers and factories as celebrities and 
conservative folk heroes. A few, such as Donald L. Bren, whose Irvine Co. owns 
thousands of acres, and William Lyon of Lyon Co., the nation's largest home 
builder, are among the richest people in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But the Birtchers still live quietly in a family compound on a hillside in San 
Juan Capistrano with a stable full of prize horses, a flock of noisy tropical 
birds and a replica of a 17th Century French manor house. Until recently few 
people, even in Orange County, had ever heard of them. 
</P>
<P>
That's because there aren't any Trump Towers in the Birtcher portfolio. 
Instead, Birtcher built itself one modest piece at a time. Safe. Deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
"We think in terms of the long run," says Baron Birtcher, one of the third 
generation of Birtchers running the family-owned firm. "This is still a pretty 
conservative company, and as we get older we get more conservative right along 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently. 
</P>
<P>
Now Birtcher finds itself on what may be the cutting edge of a new -- and some 
say disturbing -- trend after selling half its development and construction 
business to the Japanese trading firm Mitsui &amp; Co. for more than $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first time that a Japanese company has bought into a large U.S. real 
estate developer, and some experts say it signals a major shift in the way the 
Japanese invest in U.S. properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Continuity 
</P>
<P>
The Birtcher family has been around Santa Ana since 1907, when Justus Birtcher 
of Philadelphia arrived in the small farming town and began building houses. 
Fayette E. Birtcher, his son, started the company in 1939, just a few years 
before the real estate boom that exploded after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Fayette Birtcher studied entomology in college but quit during the Depression 
and took a job selling crop-spraying services to farmers. When the farms began 
to go under he joined with bankers to buy their land cheap. After the war he 
cleared the orange groves and built houses. 
</P>
<P>
Birtcher plodded along as a small family company for its first 30 years. Then 
in 1970 it hit the big time: Southern Pacific Railroad picked Birtcher to help 
develop its huge real estate holdings. Suddenly Birtcher found itself all over 
the country, constructing all sorts of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In the Birtcher family, the hard work begins early. The Birtcher men begin 
spending summer laboring on the company's construction sites as teen-agers, a 
fact they like to mention to interviewers. 
</P>
<P>
Fayette Birtcher, now 82, retired in 1965 after a heart attack. His sons Ronald 
E. Birtcher, 58, and Arthur B. Birtcher, 51, have been co-chairmen of the real 
estate concern for years. Ronald's sons, Brandon, 36, and Baron, 30, serve as 
general partners. 
</P>
<P>
But the family's interests range beyond real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Birtcher also owns one of the largest date-farming operations in the 
nation, which employs 200 people. He is one of the largest U.S. producers of 
the protea, a tropical flower, and he also owns a vineyard in the Napa Valley, 
although he doesn't drink. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Arthur Birtcher, raises and trains $100,000 hackney ponies for a 
largely Eastern establishment sport in which the animal is trained to pull a 
cart in a high-step gait. Arthur is also active in the Roman Catholic Church. 
He and his wife recently pledged $15 million to the Catholic Church's Papal 
Foundation, which helps fund religious and diplomatic missions around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the family compound is called Rancho de Dios, or "God's 
Ranch." Arthur's French manor house is barely an arm's length from his father's 
modern one-story house, which nestles up against Ronald's California ranch 
house in the family compound. 
</P>
<P>
Michael H. Voss, Birtcher's president and the highest-ranking non-family 
member, said that "the sense of continuity" provided by the various generations 
of the family is what makes makes Birtcher different. 
</P>
<P>
"Most real estate development companies survive only for the life of the 
entrepreneur who started them," he says. "We have a number of additional 
generations of Birtchers to draw on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Conservative 
</P>
<P>
A fire crackles in the big fireplace in Ronald Birtcher's spare, uncluttered 
office despite the summer heat outside. African masks glare down from the wall. 
Across the hall, where a Rodin sculpture of a naked man gazes over the 
secretaries' heads, is his brother's office, exactly the same size but 
decorated with antiques. 
</P>
<P>
He is talking, a little wistfully, about the changes at the company over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think there's a family feeling at this company," Ronald says, "but 
when you get as big as we are, I think there's less and less of that." 
</P>
<P>
The parent company and the partnerships that do the actual developing employ 
605 people in 11 offices in the West and in Washington. The family began 
bringing in outsiders in top jobs such as the presidency in the mid-1980s. The 
brothers created a board and invited their new managers and partners to sit on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
One thing, however, hasn't changed: The Birtcher conservatism. The family keeps 
what it builds, and unlike some developers, it doesn't like to borrow on its 
holdings for the next project. Instead, the family likes to spread the risk 
around by bringing in a rich partner -- an insurance company or a pension fund 
awash in cash and looking for a profitable place to park it -- that puts up 
most of the money to build a project while Birtcher contributes its expertise. 
There's less profit that way, but also less risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say I'm a chicken," Ronald says. "We've been a very low-risk company. We 
haven't been the kind of flash-in-the-pan developer you've seen in Southern 
California in the last few business cycles." 
</P>
<P>
The Birtchers don't like to put all their eggs in one basket, either. The 
company has been involved in mobile home developments, business parks and 
specialty commercial projects, a pursuit that began in 1972 when, with Southern 
Pacific, Birtcher built the 700,000-square-foot Pacific Design Center in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This year -- its 51st anniversary -- the company is ranked the 19th-largest 
U.S. developer based on National Real Estate Investor's reckoning of the amount 
of square footage the company is building. Intensely private, Birtcher will say 
little about its internal financial workings or the size of its holdings. But 
it's clear the company has made the Birtchers very rich. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also made it clear that it is thinking globally. In May, the 
company said it had reached an agreement to build a $300-million dam for a 
hydroelectric project with Liberia. The Birtchers' construction company would 
build the project -- its first abroad -- in conjunction with Anaheim-based 
Arciero Bros., although prospects for the project have been dampened by the 
civil war in the West African country. 
</P>
<P>
Birtcher also has an eye on Eastern Europe, and it has done business with 
several large Japanese companies. One of the new financial partners attracted 
to Birtcher is Mitsui, the huge Japanese conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wealthy Partner 
</P>
<P>
Mitsui, founded in 1876, is an even more venerable firm than Birtcher. It is 
now the world's oldest and largest trading company: It makes plastic parts, 
computer chips, additives for animal feed, canned seafood and other products. 
It is tied to one of Japan's largest banks. And it is also Japan's largest real 
estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies such as Mitsui began investing heavily in U.S. real estate 
around 1986. The strength of the dollar against the yen made U.S. products -- 
and real estate -- seem cheap to Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years they've spent billions buying part or all of such 
landmarks as Rockefeller Center in New York and the Arco Plaza in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At first, like most Japanese buyers, Mitsui simply bought buildings. Recently, 
though, the Japanese have become financial partners with American developers in 
constructing new buildings. It's often cheaper and more profitable than buying 
an existing building, although there's more risk. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago Mitsui decided to take a giant step in real estate: It 
proposed to buy part of Birtcher. 
</P>
<P>
From Birtcher's point of view the deal made sense. It takes a lot of money 
upfront to build a big office building or redevelop an aging downtown 
neighborhood. There are deposits to tie up land, the cost of getting the 
necessary permits from local officials. And conservative Birtcher sometimes 
wasn't willing to borrow those big sums. Mitsui is a partner with a big 
checkbook that is willing to sign its name. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mitsui announced it was putting up more than $100 million -- 
nobody will say how much was cash -- to buy half of Birtcher, excluding the 
millions of square feet of buildings already in the Birtcher portfolio. But the 
deal includes all the projects -- more than 31 -- that Birtcher is working on. 
</P>
<P>
The long-range impact of foreign real estate investment in the United States 
worries some Americans, who wonder if America isn't mortgaging its future to 
the British, the Canadians, the Dutch, the Japanese and other foreign 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
The Birtcher deal is unlikely to be the last one, though, as more Japanese 
companies start down the trail that Mitsui has blazed. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, it's a lot more politic for a Japanese company to enter the 
market by backing highly thought of domestic developers than purchasing 
property outright in the company's name," says Michael Meyer, a managing 
partner at real estate consultant Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., which worked on 
the Mitsui deal. "Japanese companies are sensitive to the backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"And this puts Birtcher in a uniquely strong position because there are 
tremendous opportunities to acquire and develop property for those who have 
access to the capital markets." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Mitsui liked Birtcher because its familial, consensus-style of 
management resembled Japanese management practices. But some things, it seems 
clear, will change at Birtcher; the company will become less and less like the 
small family business it once was. 
</P>
<P>
There's a new board with six people on it: three Americans and three Japanese. 
Mitsui eventually wants to put some of its own people into line jobs at the 
company so that they can learn the business. But aside from its new financial 
muscle, Mitsui hastens to add, the company won't change much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an American company, and it will be run 100% by Americans on a day-to-day 
basis," says Hiroyuki Sato, a senior vice president at Mitsui USA, the trading 
company's U.S. subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's possible that succeeding generations of Birtchers won't even run 
the company that bears their name. The elder Birtcher brothers had already 
begun backing off from day-to-day management even before the Mitsui deal, 
company insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon (called Brandy) and Baron, asked about stepping up to succeed their 
elders, are noncommital. 
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking executive says they may have already come to terms with the 
changes. "Brandy and Baron recognize it as an end of a chapter," says Robert M. 
Campbell, a senior partner who's been with Birtcher since 1974. "This is an 
emotional time for the family, because this is a big change. 
</P>
<P>
"But all of us are absolutely convinced this is the way to go. This is the best 
thing for the company." 
</P>

BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON: POOR SCHOOLS ARE A THREAT TO OUR 
STANDARD OF LIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON, LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON, a professor of economics at UC 
Berkeley and visiting professor this year at the Harvard Business School, is a 
member of the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, a taxi driver told me that he was sending his son back to Somalia for 
high school so he could get a better education than the one offered by the 
public schools in Washington. In the eyes of a concerned parent, the capital of 
the world's wealthiest nation cannot provide a public education comparable to 
that of an immeasurably poorer Third World nation. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt there are public school systems in the United States that compare 
favorably to -- or are better than -- those in Somalia. But for many 
disadvantaged families, the local funding base of their school districts isn't 
enough to provide even rudimentary skills in reading, writing and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of American elementary- and secondary-school education are not, 
however, limited to lower-income families -- and are not simply the result of 
inadequate funding. By now, the appalling facts about American education are 
well known, at least to those who are able to read and understand an editorial 
piece such as this one -- only an estimated 5% of American high school seniors. 
</P>
<P>
We have the highest dropout and illiteracy rates among the advanced industrial 
countries and, in comparison to other countries, our students consistently 
perform at or near the bottom of almost every examination group. Not only are 
our students far behind those of other advanced countries, they are trailing 
students of many newly industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
Even highly educated, high-income parents face a formidable challenge in 
obtaining a high-quality education for their children. Recently, a professor I 
know reported that when his son transferred from an advanced-placement program 
in a wealthy New England suburban high school to a standard high school program 
in Spain, he had to struggle to catch up to his classmates. His experience 
reflects a glaring reality: Other advanced industrial nations provide high 
school educations for all of their students that equal or exceed those we 
provide for only our college-bound students. 
</P>
<P>
Both conservatives and liberals share responsibility for the sorry state of 
American elementary and secondary education. Conservatives steadfastly hold 
that funding is adequate to the challenge. Yet a recent study by the Economic 
Policy Institute reveals that America ranks 14th out of 16 industrial nations 
in the share of national product devoted to pre-college education. It would 
take an additional $20 billion -- spare change compared to the projected cost 
of the savings and loan bailout -- simply to bring us up to the average. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the average is not good enough. To provide an education comparable 
to that in other countries, the United States has to spend proportionally more 
because of the special characteristics of the American school system and 
American society. Our decentralized system, based on local autonomy and choice, 
is more expensive than a centrally administered system. 
</P>
<P>
And our population is also more heterogenous than that of most other countries. 
Many of our school-age children do not speak English and come from diverse 
cultural backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are the special educational needs of children raised in poverty 
-- an estimated 20% of all American children, more than twice that of any 
European country. 
</P>
<P>
For previous generations of immigrants and poor children, an outstanding public 
school system provided the entry way into the mainstream. Now, for many, the 
system is an insurmountable barrier. 
</P>
<P>
If conservatives have been unwilling to recognize the funding shortfall, many 
on the left have been unwilling to support stringent national standards. 
Despite lip service to the need for academic rigor, most states and communities 
have failed to impose minimal standards for high school graduation, such as 
four years of English and three years each of math, science and social studies. 
Local control and local community values continue to be more highly valued than 
basic educational competence. 
</P>
<P>
Always enamored of the market mechanism, a growing number of American 
policy-makers argue that the solution to America's educational crisis lies in 
greater competition and choice. The idea is that if school principals have more 
autonomy, if parents have complete freedom in choosing schools and if schools 
are funded purely on the basis of the number and types of students they can 
attract, then fierce competition for students will force schools to raise 
educational standards and innovate. 
</P>
<P>
Although the choice approach may improve incentives for school performance, it 
will almost certainly worsen the educational plight of the disadvantaged, whose 
choice lies between one bad school and another. 
</P>
<P>
Country-by-country experience with effective school systems indicates that 
choice is unnecessary for educational excellence. A report released last week 
by the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce, a bipartisan 
commission created by the Rochester, N.Y.-based National Center on Education 
and the Economy, indicates that nations with good schools have one thing in 
common: a set of stringent national performance standards that virtually all 
students must meet by age 16 and that have a direct effect on their employment 
prospects. The standards establish high goals for student achievement and 
provide an objective measure against which the performance of individuals and 
schools can be assessed. None of these nations has a system of choices. 
</P>
<P>
The solution to America's educational crisis lies not in greater choice but in 
more mundane factors, such as higher teacher salaries relative to those of 
other professionals, longer school years, introduction of national curriculum 
and testing standards and a broader commitment to pre-kindergarten education, 
especially for children from disadvantaged households. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to improve elementary and secondary education will have disastrous 
consequences on our standard of living. More than 70% of American jobs require 
only a high school education. 
</P>
<P>
These jobs are the backbone of the American economy. Over the last two decades, 
as a result of lagging productivity growth and strong foreign competition, real 
wages for these jobs have fallen by 12%. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1990s, we are in for a shock. There will be fewer workers in America 
relative to the population that depends on them. If workers' real earning power 
continues to fall, everyone will be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to find a way for each worker to produce more goods and 
services for every hour worked. We used to do that by providing our workers 
with more sophisticated machinery than our foreign competitors were using. Now, 
many countries with lower wages use the same machinery, often with 
better-educated workers -- and thus can afford to sell their products at lower 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
American producers have responded in predictable ways: They have curtailed 
wages and benefits or moved production offshore. High-paying jobs for American 
workers have been disappearing at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the report by the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce 
indicates, there is a high-wage strategy for meeting the challenges of low-wage 
foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy rests on new forms of work organization that give greater 
responsibility, earning power and productivity to average workers through 
greater delegation of authority, reduction of supervision, job rotation and 
flexibility and continuing training. 
</P>
<P>
Many European and Japanese companies, and some American companies -- such as 
Hewlett-Packard and International Business Machines -- have demonstrated the 
productivity-enhancing effects of such organizational changes. 
</P>
<P>
Without a dramatic improvement in elementary and secondary education, however, 
the high-wage strategy for meeting foreign competition is not feasible for most 
American companies. High-performance work organizations require highly 
qualified workers who can learn continuously, adapt quickly and contribute to 
the development of new ideas. These are not the characteristics of most 
American high school graduates today. 
</P>
<P>
Unless we solve our educational crisis, we are doomed to future cuts in our 
standard of living to meet the competition of better educated, more productive 
workers in the rest of the world.

TREASURER'S CAMPAIGN COMES CALLING ON THE INVESTMENT BANKS

<P>
For the past few months, state Treasurer Tom Hayes has been wearing two hats -- 
one as campaigner, the other as guardian of the state's public purse. That 
can't be easy for a button-down guy who is a novice on the campaign trail and 
who is just beginning to master his current job. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes -- a 43-year-old ex-Marine who was appointed to the job in January, 1989, 
and won the Republican primary earlier this month -- is portrayed by his 
supporters as a fiscal taskmaster and a steady hand at the helm of the state's 
vast financial empire. During the general election campaign, voters will be 
reminded of his credentials as a champion of the competitive bidding process 
and as a trustworthy custodian of California's AAA credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
But with a formidable opponent in Democrat Kathleen Brown, Hayes faces an 
expensive statewide campaign that depends on a lot of big contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, campaign fund-raising and the state's financial affairs have crossed 
paths, illustrating what a wobbly tightrope Hayes must walk. 
</P>
<P>
On April 26, Hayes solicited proposals from 16 of the nation's largest 
investment banking firms on issuing $150 million in revenue bonds for 
construction of the California state prison in Madera. Companies such as Smith 
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.; Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.; Lazard Freres &amp; 
Co.; Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.; Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, and First 
Boston Corp. were contacted. Their proposals were due back in the Treasurer's 
office May 4. 
</P>
<P>
On May 16, the investment bankers were notified that all of the firms invited 
to submit proposals had done so but that the Treasurer's office would delay a 
decision on which firm would manage sale of the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, many of the same firms or their employees were invited to 
campaign fund-raising luncheons for Hayes. A $1,000-a-plate affair was 
scheduled for May 10 at the executive dining room of Security Pacific Bank in 
Los Angeles and a $500-a-plate gathering for May 24 at the Bankers Club in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Critics see a conflict of interest. "You should not be raising funds from those 
people who you are soliciting (state business) from," argues Ruth Holton, 
legislative advocate for Common Cause. "Even if it wasn't a deliberate attempt 
to coerce a contribution, there appears to be a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes was not available for comment, but spokespersons for his campaign and the 
Treasurer's office denied a link between his fund-raising activities and 
decisions in the Treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just stop the business of the state because Tom has a campaign to 
run," said Donna Lucas, of the Treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Treasurer Russell Gould said his office's guidelines prohibit the 
staff from getting involved with Hayes' campaign. Campaign manager Brian 
Lungren said lists used for the fund-raisers were not obtained from the 
Treasurer's office and that campaign officials had no knowledge of the Madera 
prison project. 
</P>
<P>
"We are no different than any other campaign," Lungren said. "We rely on local 
fund-raising consultants, and they often have developed lists from other 
campaigns, such as Bush, Reagan and Deukmejian." 
</P>
<P>
The Hayes campaign also taps a "house list," which is made up of 6,000 
contributors who have previously donated to him. Lungren said there's little 
doubt that some names on the Treasurer's bidding list would also show up on 
fund-raising rosters. In fact, all of the firms on the bid list for the Madera 
prison project have previously contributed to the Hayes campaign or have key 
employees who contributed. In 1989, Hayes received at least $80,000 from these 
companies or their employees. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there is nothing illegal about an elected state officeholder 
soliciting political contributions from the same groups that do business with a 
state agency -- unless there is a quid pro quo between candidate and 
contributor. 
</P>
<P>
What about the appearance of a conflict of interest? "We are going out with 
RFPs (requests for proposals) all of the time. This is no different," Lucas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One investment banker, who asked to remain anonymous, had a different view. "It 
was breathless timing," he said. "Never have I seen such a hurried attempt to 
issue a bond and then have everything be put on hold -- all right before the 
(primary) election." 
</P>
<P>
But Gould cites other reasons for delaying the Madera prison bond sale: "Just 
about the time we were making plans to go to market, the governor announced the 
$3-billion budget deficit. That's not a good time to make investor decisions of 
this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
The investment banking community has a mixed view of the matter. "This is an 
example of how politicalized the process can get," complained a banker who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any relationship between the two (fund-raising and the bids)," 
said a representative from Prudential-Bache. "Maybe it's because I receive so 
many fund-raising requests this time of year. I've got seven on my desk right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
First Boston apparently felt that attending the San Francisco fund-raiser would 
hurt its chances of doing business with the state, so it didn't attend. "It may 
sound odd, but we were worried that appearing on the list of attendees might 
hurt us in the long run, given Mr. Hayes' widely proclaimed divorce between 
policy and politics," managing director Michael George said. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign manager Lungren declared flatly that contributors won't get special 
treatment when it comes to awarding state business. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has been up front about his commitment to competitive bidding and open 
about his fund-raising philosophy," Lungren said. "If contributors want to 
demonstrate their support of open and competitive bidding, they can contribute 
to the campaign, but all they can hope for in return is that they will be 
treated fairly."

LATIN AMERICANS TAKE A STEP INTO THE ECONOMIC MAINSTREAM; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: OFFICIALS SPEAK OF APERTURA, OPENING UP TO THE FREE FLOW OF 
INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE. EXPERTS SAY CONCRETE REFORMS ARE NEEDED.

<TEXT>
<P>
For much of the 20th Century, Latin America has anguished over its economic 
underdevelopment. Its failure to achieve industrial power and prosperity has 
been blamed on everything from Iberian absolutism and Yankee imperialism to 
capital flight and foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the century wanes, a consensus seems to be taking shape, if not on the 
reasons for Latin American underdevelopment, at least on a basic requirement 
for growing out of it: Latin America must successfully compete in the expanding 
global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
The key to that, in a word, is apertura (Spanish), or abertura (Portuguese). It 
means opening up Latin American economies to the free flow of international 
commerce, getting into the world mainstream of technology, productivity and 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
A new wave of elected presidents in major Latin American countries is placing 
high hopes on such a common policy. From Mexico to Argentina, apertura has 
become an official slogan in the drive for development. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea is not new, it has never attracted such wide attention. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 1930s, major Latin American countries erected import barriers 
aimed at fostering domestic industry and saving foreign currency. The "import 
substitution" policy prevailed into the 1980s, when it became clear that 
protected industries were often inefficient and outdated. 
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the region all but stopped. Latin America's share of world 
trade fell in the 1980s from 6% to 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Strapped countries had to reduce their imports drastically, not only to balance 
trade accounts but to make payments on billions of dollars in foreign debt. As 
a result, the United States lost sales to a region that had been one of its 
best customers for manufactured products. In 1981, 20% of U.S. exports went to 
Latin America; in 1987, it was 14%. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1980s, Washington preached apertura as a remedy for Latin 
America's problems. Chile and Mexico have had some success with the policy, 
setting an example that is being heeded elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina 
are putting apertura into practice. President Fernando Collor de Mello of 
Brazil, inaugurated in March, has voiced strong support for the policy. So have 
Presidents-elect Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Alberto Fujimori of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, once an 
advocate of import substitution, said in a May report that apertura is in. 
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Changing Production Patterns with Social Equity," said the 
"prevailing idea in the region is that the present state of affairs calls for a 
progressively greater exposure of production units to external competition." 
</P>
<P>
Economists emphasize that apertura is not a magic wand. They say it must come 
with fiscal reforms, investment capital and new technology if Latin America is 
to share in the world boom in high-tech exports. 
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of the region's exports are primary commodities, including 
petroleum, and "a country's possibility of entering international markets on a 
solid footing" depends largely on "its ability to keep up with international 
trends in technology," the U.N. commission's report said. 
</P>
<P>
Some people say the United States could profit by helping Latin America catch 
up and keep up. As they see it, the United States could be elbowed aside by a 
united Germany and Japan. They see a capitalist revitalization of Latin America 
as a counterweight. 
</P>
<P>
"It is what some American diplomats and politicians think and want," Roberto 
Campos, a conservative Brazilian senator and former finance minister, said 
recently. Unfortunately, he said, potential investors are reluctant in the face 
of obsolete nationalism, unrealistic unionism and terrorist violence. 
</P>
<P>
In an article this month, Campos said Latin America is more likely to be left 
an economic backwater. In the decades of adversarial U.S.-Soviet relations, the 
West was interested in keeping Latin America in the capitalist camp, he said. 
But today, socialism is not viewed as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"The Third World lost its blackmail power," Campos said. 
</P>
<P>
It can be argued either way. Other analysts say the relaxation of Cold War 
tension should benefit Latin America because the countries of the region will 
turn from security to economic concerns, to developing stronger trade relations 
not only with the United States but with other industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
But David Ronfeldt, a political scientist with RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, 
contends that regardless of East-West dynamics, Latin America appears to be 
heading for "the failure of democracy and a plunge into a new dark age." 
</P>
<P>
Ronfeldt wrote in Hemisphere, a publication of Florida International 
University, that drug cartels, guerrillas, economic stagnation and political 
disarray are likely to erode the fragile democracies, leading to new takeovers 
by dictators and demagogues of the right and left. His dismal scenario calls 
for increased violence in the region and less trade and investment by developed 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The country most likely to avoid the "new dark age," Ronfeldt said, is Mexico. 
He advises the United States to keep its distance from the turmoil in the rest 
of the region while working to bring Mexico into a North American economic 
bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Peter F. Drucker, a professor of social sciences at the Claremont Graduate 
School, argues that the United States may find great economic opportunity -- 
greater than in East Europe -- not only in Mexico but throughout Latin America. 
He has suggested that the United States could reduce its trade deficit by 
reviving Latin America as a customer for its manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a great deal easier to turn around Latin America than to turn 
around Eastern Europe," Drucker wrote in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America can feed itself, and it has well-trained engineers, 
entrepreneurs, accountants, economists and lawyers. It also has long experience 
with market economies and billions of dollars of capital -- kept abroad because 
of insecurity at home. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of Latin American money overseas is estimated at more than $200 
billion. Drucker observes that if this capital were invested in Latin American 
industries that could compete in international markets, it could launch all but 
the most backward of the region's countries into rapid economic development.

HARMONY IN ARCHITECTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When movie producer and architecture-buff Joel Silver was restoring the Storer 
House in Hollywood, one of Frank Lloyd Wright's residential masterpieces, work 
nearly stopped while contractors, architectural preservationists and even 
Wright's grandson, Eric Wright, searched for the exact formula to duplicate the 
structure's concrete blocks. It wasn't until a little of the soil from the 
backyard was mixed with cement that the blocks were exactly as Wright had made 
them -- his concept of "organic architecture" at work. 
</P>
<P>
Wright believed that all parts of architecture must be harmoniously integrated. 
The outdoors should be an intimate part of the interior? living space; 
materials should flow from the surrounding landscape. This philosophy 
ultimately earned Wright a permanent spot at the forefront of modern 
architecture, a position justly earned, as witnessed in "Frank Lloyd Wright: In 
the Realm of Ideas." 
</P>
<P>
The show, featuring 160 works, including photographic enlargements, details and 
renderings, and large-scale architectural models and furnishing (only half of 
which were ever built), runs through September 30 at the San Diego Museum of 
Art.

PURPLISH PINK hydrangeas. Burgundy snapdragons. Sky-blue irises. A Saturday 
morning visit to the wholesale flower market in downtown Los Angeles ensures a 
colorful start to a weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Bunches of blooms are sold at bargain prices, but you have to get an early 
start -- the market is open only from 6 a.m. to noon (vendors remain open a 
little later on Saturday, until 1 p.m.), though the action actually starts to 
wind down by about 8:30 a.m. If picking flowers makes you hungry, the Flower 
Market Coffee Shop is open from 5:30 to 9:45 a.m. on Saturdays for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Saturday morning at the Southern California Flower Market building 
on the west side of the street, Miwa Floral was selling long pussy willow 
branches, irises and daffodils. At San Lorenzo, which always has a large 
selection and a friendly staff, there were large and small tulips, snapdragons 
and a wide variety of cacti and potted plants. In the same building, Tayama 
Wholesale Florist is the stop for orchids, anthuriums, gingers and other 
exotics. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Flower Market of American Florists Exchange Ltd. across the 
street (where most vendors post prices for easy self-service), nearly 
everywhere you look, you'll see a rainbow of statice, mums and stock. Try 
Petals of Paradise Tropical Wholesale Specialist for tropicals and exotics, 
and, in season, ask at Groen Rose Co. for pots of those purplish pink 
hydrangeas. Robin TuckerDowntown Los Angeles Flower Market, 754 Wall St.; (213)

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
AIDS Reporting 
</P>
<P>
The House shelved, 312 to 113, a proposal that states keep confidential lists 
of people testing positive for the AIDS virus and use the names for "partner 
notification." Backers said this would stem the epidemic by enabling health 
officials to trace sexual contact and tell unknowing partners of their exposure 
to AIDS. But critics raised privacy concerns and said the specter of being 
listed would discourage those at risk from getting tested. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House sent to conference with the Senate a bill (HR 
4785) authorizing nearly $900 million in fiscal 1991 for AIDS-fighting grants 
to states, to cities hardest hit by the disease and for treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking against federally mandated listings, J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.) said most 
states use "a combination of anonymous and confidential reporting which seems 
to be working very well." 
</P>
<P>
Howard C. Nielson (R-Utah) said, "AIDS treatment is a health issue, not a civil 
rights issue." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote opposed requiring states to keep confidential AIDS lists for use in 
partner notification.

Water Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 316 to 97, the House further limited federal water subsidies 
available to Western growers under the 1982 Reclamation Reform Act. The 
amendment sought to close a loophole through which some large farms are said to 
have assembled into smaller units in order to receive the taxpayer-subsidized 
irrigation water available to farms of less than 960 acres. The vote occurred 
as the House passed a bill (HR 2567) funding Bureau of Reclamation public 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Marty Russo (D-Ill.) said the amendment ensures that "the wealthy 
land barons in . . . Western states pay their fair share for water that they 
get from this country." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent John J. Rhodes III (R-Ariz.) called the amendment "a nuclear attack" 
on a small problem. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to further limit Western water subsidies.

Farm Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 338 to 55 to prevent subsidized federal water from irrigating 
surplus crops whose production the government wants to curtail. The amendment 
to HR 2567 (above) would phase out the dual subsidies that provide some Western 
farmers with both low-cost U.S. water and crop-witholding payments. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) said, "Crops that are in surplus ought not to 
get subsidized water to grow ever more surplus." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Sid Morrison (R-Wash.) said the amendment would have "a devastating 
impact on that small family farm" common to his district. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to end the dual subsidy.

CRIMINAL TYPE LOOMS AGAINST SUNDAY SILENCE; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: LATE-BLOOMING SON OF ALYDAR IS EXPECTED TO BE MAIN THREAT TO '89 
HORSE OF THE YEAR IN GOLD CUP. 
</P>

<P>
Where's Easy Goer? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question trainer Wayne Lukas is semi-seriously asking as he sends 
out Criminal Type today to run against a field that's already loaded in the 
$1-million Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, the 1989 horse of the year; stablemate Ruhlmann, this year's 
Santa Anita Handicap winner; and Opening Verse, who has won three of his last 
four starts, are enough opposition for any horse, without including a runner of 
Easy Goer's caliber. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lukas wonders why the colt that Criminal Type beat in the recent 
Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park didn't cross the country, as his horse 
did, to run in the 51st Gold Cup, which has drawn seven starters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a million-dollar race, you've got a chance to beat last year's 
champion and it fits into Easy Goer's schedule," Lukas said of the 1 1/4-mile 
event. "He ought to be here. They say hampionships are won in the fall, but the 
horse who wins this race gets a leg up on what's to come." 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Stakes winner Easy Goer ran third in the Metropolitan, his second start 
since those second-place finishes to Sunday Silence in last year's Kentucky 
Derby, Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic. Easy Goer's next race is to be the 
Suburban Handicap at Belmont July 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Easy Goer will win the Suburban against not much of a field, and then about 
400 guys back there will start writing again that he's the greatest horse in 
the world," Lukas said, referring to the New York media. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas is not really surprised that Easy Goer isn't running in the Gold Cup. 
Ogden Phipps is a New Yorker, and his horses seldom leave their home grounds. 
All 13 of Easy Goer's victories have come in New York, and four of his six 
losses have come outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Lukas had to persuade J. T. Lundy, who manages Calumet Farm's racing 
interests, that the already well-traveled Criminal Type ought to leave New York 
and run in the Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"It took some salesmanship," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type, with eight victories, five seconds and three thirds in 21 races 
and earnings of $1.6 million, has been on the move since his 2-year-old season, 
which was spent without much success in France in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type left France toward the end of 1988 after winning one of five 
starts at four different tracks. Last year, under Lukas for the first time, the 
son of Alydar and Klepto, a No Robbery mare, went two for eight, never showing 
enough ability to leave the allowance ranks. This season, however, he has won 
five of eight starts, with two seconds, and today he could win his second 
$1-million race in six weeks. He won the Pimlico Special by a neck over 
Ruhlmann on May 12. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type turned a corner at Lukas' Hollywood Park barn the other morning, 
on his way down the shed row for a reshoeing date with a blacksmith. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas beamed at the horse's condition, but then cast a qualifying doubt about 
how Criminal Type will perform in the Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks like he's ready to run another big race," Lukas said. "The one thing 
is, horses going from East to West don't always run as well as the horses 
traveling from West to East. I don't know why this is, but it's so. And it's 
something that nags at you going into this race." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the conditions look right for Criminal Type. He has the tactical 
speed that will enable his jockey, Jose Santos, to place him just off Ruhlmann, 
who will supply the pace for his stablemate, Sunday Silence, and is capable of 
running away with the race, as he did in the Santa Anita Handicap, if no one 
gets chummy with him. 
</P>
<P>
Eual Wyatt, Hollywood Park's racing secretary, was kind to Sunday Silence, not 
adding any weight to the 126 pounds he carried while winning the Californian in 
his last start. Criminal Type, who because of his slow start has never had to 
carry much weight, has been assigned 121 pounds, a pound more than he 
shouldered in the Metropolitan. 
</P>
<P>
"Criminal Type showed me something," said Bob Levy, after his Housebuster lost 
the Metropolitan by a neck. "He's a real tough horse. We led all the way and 
had the lead by a length or two with an eighth of a mile to go, but we just 
couldn't put him away." 
</P>
<P>
After the Gold Cup, Lukas plans to send Criminal Type to another major race, 
the Arlington Challenge Cup in the Chicago suburbs on Aug. 4. If both Easy Goer 
and Sunday Silence are entered, Arlington International Racecourse will put up 
a $1-million purse. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not a million, maybe we won't go," Lukas said. "I hear they're running 
the Whitney at Saratoga the same day, and you know how those guys (the Phipps 
family) are. They don't go out of New York very much."

ON CURRENT AMERICAN TOUR, JAPAN'S GRAND KABUKI THEATRE GOES OFF THE BEATEN

<TEXT>
<P>
On a scorchingly hot Saturday afternoon in Hondo, Tex. (pop: 6,000), a dozen 
guys were knocking back a few beers at the ramshackle College of Knowledge. A 
fan made out of a beer can whirled lazily over the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Although this homespun watering hole hasn't been a grocery store for quite some 
time, no one ever bothered to remove the wooden shelves lining the walls. A 
sign reads: "The College of Knowledge / The Oldest College in Hondo / Experts 
Are Always Available / May Hear Debates on Anything Anytime." 
</P>
<P>
Today's "debates" were going to be a mite different, however. It just so 
happened that Nakamura Kichiemon II, artistic director and star of the 
Tokyo-based Grand Kabuki Theatre, had a hankering to see some real cowboys, and 
a Japanese TV crew was dying to get some colorful footage of the curious 
goings-on in Small Town, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
The company was performing 30 miles due east in San Antonio, the second stop on 
its 12-city "heartland" tour of the United States. Although the cross-country 
trek includes performances Saturday and next Sunday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, and July 3 and 4 at Japan America Theatre in Los 
Angeles, the emphasis on this tour is on mid-size cities between the two 
coasts. 
</P>
<P>
This is a big chunk of America that is utterly mysterious to the Japanese, 
explained Jane Corddry, the bilingual and seemingly unflappable Japanese 
projects director for One Reel, Seattle-based producer of the tour. TV news in 
Japan doesn't deal with happenings in the United States outside New York, Los 
Angeles and Washington, she said, so their notions of the American heartland 
are essentially images from "Dallas" or "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
"You never see this much sky in Japan," Corddry added, looking up at the huge 
bowl of blue sky studded with hefty cumulus clouds. Nor do the Japanese erect 
signs like the one along the highway leading to Hondo: "This is God's country. 
Please don't drive like hell." 
</P>
<P>
A convoy of three cars disgorged a milling knot of visitors to the sleepy 
College of Knowledge: Nakamura, two women assistants; mustached, intense 
Hironobu Nagano, Fuji Television Network's chief coordinator; feisty, 
red-haired Melinda Iverson, the TV coordinator employed by One Reel; the TV 
crew; Corddry; a free-lance photographer and this writer. 
</P>
<P>
Trim and gray-haired at 46, Nakamura is a TV and film star at home, as well as 
a leading Kabuki actor. For the trip to Hondo he was nattily turned out in 
jeans, a rakish cloth hat, a partially unbuttoned shirt and a red bandanna worn 
with the panache of an ascot. A huge gold belt buckle with a silver boot 
twinkled at his waist, a gift from Norm Langill, executive producer of the U.S. 
tour and Corddry's husband. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the brainstorm of the TV crew, assigned to follow the entire tour 
for a 90-minute prime-time TV documentary to be aired next fall in Japan. They 
had figured on filming Nakamura in Hondo's Western wear store, remaking his 
image with tooled boots and a 10-gallon hat. But now that the star was already 
duded up in Western gear, it was time to switch to Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
No sweat: The College of Knowledge could have been dreamed up by Central 
Casting. Once the initial awkwardness wore off, Nakamura easily took center 
stage. He asked the regulars if people still watch John Wayne in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
When Iverson translated the question, a man with thick white hair, a Lite beer 
T-shirt stretched across his belly and a cross tattoo proclaimed: "He's an 
American hero. He'll always be an American hero." 
</P>
<P>
Listening to the flurry of Japanese, his companion, a middle-aged blond woman 
in a pink T-shirt, snug jeans and gold hoop earrings, muttered, "That's a 
foreign language, like talkin' Mexican." The bar's sole Mexican patron, a man 
who said he spoke no English and stood at a careful distance from the others, 
looked impassive. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing a rapid description of Nakamura's fame at home, White Hair 
explained to Pink Shirt: "He's the Marlon Brando of Japan." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever," she said wearily. 
</P>
<P>
Now Nakamura wanted to know about the words printed on the man's beer caddy. 
"It says bull s--- Bob," White Hair answered. Nakamura laughed before Iverson 
had a chance to translate. "Now, I thought you couldn't understand that!" the 
man rejoined. 
</P>
<P>
Iverson prodded the regulars to speak out about the state of U.S.-Japanese 
relations. "I really don't have much to say, one way or 'nother," one replied. 
Someone else wanted to know what steak costs per pound "across the border" in 
Japan. Nagano did some rapid figuring, translating kilos to pounds, yen to 
dollars, and said "$10." 
</P>
<P>
"Here you can get the best steak in the country for $3 per pound," came the 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
Another man said: "At some point in time our country is going to get as strong 
as Japan. Eventually we'll be equal partners." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Lutz had a longer memory. He's a small, wiry elderly man with a pack of 
cigarettes in his pocket, a baseball-style cap that says "Lawn Rangers" and a 
can of beer in a paper sack. "Charlie was here two years before God," someone 
called out. 
</P>
<P>
Lutz's low voice was initially impossible to hear at the distance a reporter 
had to stand from the video camera, but the words "Pearl Harbor" were 
unmistakable. Lutz asked the crew how old they are; all were in their 30s, born 
years after World War II ended. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Nagano made a bowing, prayer-like gesture of respect and said, "In my 
grandfather's place, I apologize." 
</P>
<P>
Lutz shook his head. "Naw, you don't have to. It wadn't your fault." 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura -- who uses a stage name that once belonged to his maternal 
grandfather, Nakamura Kichiemon I -- was born into a family of distinguished 
Kabuki actors. He trained in Kabuki acting, music and dance as a child and made 
his stage debut at age 4. A frail youngster, he always played "the little sick 
boy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The expectation was that he would also make his mark in the family profession. 
But, as Corddry -- who was serving as our interpreter -- explained, "What 
you're really born into is an option," not an iron-clad rule of succession. 
</P>
<P>
When Nakamura's older brother, known as Koshiro IX, made his mark on the stage, 
the younger boy felt the pinch of sibling rivalry. Rather than stand in the 
shadow of his brother, he enrolled in Waseda University and majored in French 
literature with the idea of becoming a man of letters. 
</P>
<P>
The idol of his university days was the precocious French poet and novelist 
Raymond Radiguet, who died at age 17 in 1923 from typhoid and dissolution, the 
same year he published "Le Diable au Corps" (The Devil in the Flesh), a story 
of an adolescent boy's affair with a soldier's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Nakamura had a French girlfriend. Now he is married to a Japanese 
woman who is said to be an energetic guardian of her husband's public image. 
The couple have four children, ages 6 to 13 -- all girls, however, who cannot 
carry on the family tradition since, in Kabuki, all the women's parts are 
played by men. 
</P>
<P>
At 20, Nakamura finally decided he did have the stuff to be a Kabuki actor. 
Since then he has become known for complex heroic roles, ranging from a great 
general (Kumagai) to a brave outlaw (Mochiyama Michitose). 
</P>
<P>
He played a warrior monk in a yearlong historical drama ("Musashibo Benkei") on 
the national Japanese TV network and is now starring as a samurai detective in 
a Fuji TV series, "Onihei Hankacho." The shooting schedule was rearranged so 
that he could come on the U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
Corddry explained that One Reel, producer of the U.S. tour, had specifically 
requested Nakamura because of his audience appeal and youthfulness, and were 
afraid he might not agree. The actor admitted that he was "anxious and uneasy" 
because the United States -- which he had never visited -- was "a completely 
unknown world." But he brightened up when urged to think of himself as an 
adventurer with a sense of mission and courage. 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of their first performance, the company had arranged to arrive 
at the Lila Cockrell Theater on the tourist barges that ply the portion of the 
San Antonio River winding through the downtown area. The ceremonial 
opening-night barge trip was a tradition of the Grand Kabuki in Tokyo before 
the portion of the river running past the theater was filled in and built over 
in the 1950s, and the ritual is still practiced in Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
Setting off from a downtown San Antonio hotel in smothering 100-degree heat, 
the barges carrying the robed actors and the musicians playing flutes, drums 
and lute-like samisen were an exotic sight. The boats were adorned with tall 
rows of banners that had to be lowered under each of the bridges spanning the 
narrow channel. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura's radiant smile and enthusiastic wave would have stood him in good 
stead at the Rose Bowl Parade. But no crowds lined the river bank. In fact, for 
portions of the journey, the city looked like a ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a few sweltering people trudged by, staring blankly at the barge. 
Every now and then someone waved briefly in response to Iverson's cheerfully 
frantic direction from a third barge carrying the video crew. Early diners at 
the outdoor restaurants paused to gawk. But the whole exercise -- faithfully 
recorded on video -- turned out to be mostly for the benefit of the Japanese TV 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was a big topic of conversation in town; the summer heat wave had 
made an unusually early appearance. Nakamura later said he felt a little dizzy 
on stage and asked the theater to turn up the air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
He played the shrewish wife in "Migawari Zazen" (The Substitute Mediator), a 
comic piece about a young lord who devises an elaborate plot to spend a night 
with his lover, only to be tricked and trapped by his determined spouse. 
</P>
<P>
During the second half of the double-bill evening, Nakamura got to show off his 
bravura aragoto acting style, which involves big-scale movement performed in 
huge, elaborate costumes. In "Narukami" (The Thunder God), he plays a devout 
hermit priest who, in a fit of pique with the emperor, has trapped the rain god 
in a pool beneath a waterfall. Desperate to relieve the resulting drought, the 
court sends beautiful Princess Taema to seduce the priest and thereby break the 
spell. (These two pieces will be performed in Orange County, but Los Angeles 
audiences will see "Kanjincho" (The Subscription List) and "Osome Hisamatsu 
Ukina No Yomiuri.") 
</P>
<P>
The priest eventually gets drunk and passes out, enabling the princess to cut 
the sacred rope and let the rain fall. When he comes to and discovers what has 
happened, he throws a fit. Transformed into the thunder god -- with a huge head 
of black hair, fierce makeup and robes patterned with flames and lightning -- 
he becomes a raging, larger-than-life specter who abandons religion and sets 
off in crashing pursuit of the princess. 
</P>
<P>
In her review of the opening night performance, the theater critic for the San 
Antonio Light airily noted that "you don't really need to understand the words 
to enjoy the show." But audience members who didn't plunk down the $5 rental 
fee for the simultaneous-translation cassette looked baffled when their 
plugged-in neighbors laughed at details of the amorous byplay. 
</P>
<P>
As luck would have it, however, at least one member of the audience -- whose 
headset was intermittently picking up a local rock station -- had the peculiar 
sensation of hearing commercials for Yamaha and Suzuki while watching a classic 
17th-Century play. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a less than sellout crowd opening night -- 75% of the 2,400-seat house 
was filled -- the San Antonio audience gave the company a warm reception. At 
the intermission, one man murmured to his companion, "Well, it doesn't matter 
if it's Shakespeare or Kabuki -- women always win in the end." 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Kabuki was one of a handful of big-ticket events at the San Antonio 
Festival, a 17-day potpourri of high and popular culture. The formerly 
debt-ridden festival looked to the Japanese troupe and a couple of other 
high-profile events (a concert by singer Gary Morris, a performance by ballet 
star Fernando Bujones) to avert financial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodating the festival dates required a geographical zigzag for the Kabuki 
company (from Columbus, Ohio, to San Antonio to Atlanta) on a tour that 
otherwise moves from East to West, continuing from Georgia to Indianapolis, 
Iowa City, Lincoln, Neb., Minneapolis, Costa Mesa, Los Angeles, Berkeley, 
Portland and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The company was surprised, Corddry said, to learn that the United States has so 
many large metropolitan centers with big theaters and cultural centers. In 
Japan, outside of Tokyo and Osaka, the company would expect to find only school 
auditoriums or other rudimentary venues. 
</P>
<P>
On this tour, local presenters had to agree to allow the installation of a 
hanamichi, a raised platform extending from stage right to the back of the 
house that is used for dramatic -- and sometimes thunderously heavy-footed -- 
entrances and exits. 
</P>
<P>
This piece of stage furniture requires a tete-a-tete with the local fire 
marshal because it blocks one of the exits, violating theater safety rules. The 
hanamichi also deprives the presenter of income from the 20 to 40 orchestra 
seats that can't be used because the platform extends across them. 
</P>
<P>
Other requirements for this tour include bento, the traditional lunch boxes the 
cast expects every day. Six months ago, during a cross-country checkout of all 
the venues, One Reel representatives tracked down Japanese restaurants in each 
city that could prepare 65 lunches at once. 
</P>
<P>
Translators -- to ease language problems for the local stage crews and others 
who deal with the company -- are another necessity. Most of One Reel's 
personnel on the tour are bilingual. Even so, the festival had to commandeer 
two university students from Austin for last-minute backstage translating 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of New York and Los Angeles -- cities the company has toured frequently 
in the past -- economic and cultural support can be elusive. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage as much community involvement as possible," Corddry said. "We 
remind (presenters) about the local Japan-America Society, the consulate, 
Japanese businesses. In some cities there are universities with Japan experts . 
. . but we still need to provide a lot of background material." 
</P>
<P>
But even in Tokyo, Corddry had to beat the bushes for six months until Shimizu 
Corp., a construction and engineering company, agreed to be the tour's 
corporate sponsor. Now that unfavorable stories of Japanese takeovers in the 
States have become commonplace, she said, the trend is for manufacturers of 
Japanese consumer goods not to emphasize their cultural identity. These days, 
they tend to direct their philanthropy to community organizations like the 
Little League. 
</P>
<P>
After the opening-night performance, audience members streamed into a nearby 
hotel for a lavish bash thrown by Sony, with plentiful offerings of sushi, 
guacamole and other pan-cultural treats. The local sponsor of the tour, Sony, 
is one of three Japanese-owned businesses in town. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the first Japanese-owned company to come to the city was 
blood-pressure instrument manufacturer Colin Medical Instruments Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Yugi Kawabata, 37 -- who admits, with some embarrassment, that 
he never got around to seeing the Grand Kabuki when he lived in Tokyo -- says 
he enjoys his new surroundings. He praises the "good old American people who 
work very hard" and remind him of characters in the TV show, "Father Knows 
Best." 
</P>
<P>
In April, TB Co. of Osaka bought the Club at Sonterra, a country club founded 
by a Texan in 1984. The new owner, Kiyonori Higa -- another John Wayne devotee 
-- promised at a press conference that things at the club would remain very 
much the same. 
</P>
<P>
So far the only changes folks have noticed at the club are the tidying of one 
of the golf courses, a large-scale flower-planting project and a newly zealous 
emphasis on cleanliness. The ladies' room now boasts a rather startling 
contraption: With a press of a button, the transparent toilet seat cover zips 
around to reveal a hygienic expanse of virgin plastic suitable for the most 
germ-fearing user. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent among the post-performance party-goers were members of San Antonio's 
Japan-America Society, whose 160 supporters are just about evenly divided 
between Americans -- many of whom have lived in Japan -- and Japanese. In this 
city of military bases, most of the Japanese population are women who married 
American servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroko Fay, 55, an energetic and friendly woman who runs her own bookkeeping 
and tax service and works as a translator on the side, came to San Antonio 26 
years ago from Tokyo as the bride of an American soldier, a preacher's son who 
played the organ at Tokyo Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
"You dreamed about the luxury" in America, she recalled. But her husband was 
initially posted to Ft. Hood in Killeen, Tex. -- "a little bitty town with no 
trees." After that shock, San Antonio seemed relatively bearable. Fluent in 
English, she immediately began working for a carpet company. 
</P>
<P>
She remembers how strange American rice looked and tasted, and how she didn't 
speak Japanese "for years." But she was determined to make it in San Antonio 
even after her husband left her while she was expecting their second child. 
</P>
<P>
Now remarried to another American, she says she never experienced prejudice. 
"The population is more than 50% Mexican-American. People are used to seeing 
different (skin) colors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fay had taken a visitor under her wing the day before the performance, pointing 
out how the city's so-called Japanese Tea Gardens in Brackenridge Park -- built 
in 1917 by Japanese-born Kimi Jingu, who lived there with his family -- were 
renamed the Chinese Tea Gardens after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The city 
shut off the Jingu family's water supply, forcing them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
(Jingu's wife, Alice, later moved to Los Angeles, where she had acted in the 
film "Teahouse of the August Moon." Her last role before she died in 1969 was 
with Cary Grant in "Walk, Don't Run," set in Tokyo.) 
</P>
<P>
Although the garden was rededicated in 1984 with its original name, the design 
was changed by the Chinese gardeners who lived there during the war with tiered 
gardens separated by piles of vertical rocks and Chinese-style ornamental 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio's real Japanese garden is a 2 1/2-year-old oasis of calm near the 
entrance to the San Antonio Botanical Gardens. Fay explained that the bent 
bamboo edging along the paths was necessary to keep Americans from clambering 
over the rocks. "Visitors are not trained like Japanese visitors," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
At the reception, there were speeches by Mayor Lila Cockrell; the consul 
general, who buzzed in from Houston ("Don't jump at the conclusion that 
flirtation and seduction are the everyday business of Japan," he teased); and 
Chikashi Mogi, the company's executive producer, who shrewdly declared his 
company had "pioneered Kabuki in Texas tonight!" The applause was mighty. 
</P>
<P>
Then senior members of the company were trotted out for brief words and bows. 
Junior company members -- most in elegantly cut European suits, a few in 
traditional dress -- wolfed down the food and smoked up a storm, pausing 
politely to applaud their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Finally -- when midnight began to seem a distant memory -- the festively garbed 
Japanese women of San Antonio clustered aggressively around their idol, 
Nakamura, holding out fans and programs for his signature, and flinging their 
arms around him for photos. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura, on his first tour of America, had found his first groupies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand Kabuki Theatre of Japan performs Saturday at 8 p.m. and July 1 at 2 
p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa 
Mesa. Tickets: $15 to $35. Information: (714) 556-2787.(CQ)

RANDY LEWIS: SUMMER BRINGS CONCERT LOUTS OUT FROM UNDER THEIR ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summer is upon us once again, bringing with it a seasonal pest that even 
repeated malathion sprayings haven't been able to eradicate. 
</P>
<P>
It's known as the rock lout, a subspecies of the genus Homo imbecilus that also 
includes such near relatives as the opera hummer ("Dum dum de dump dump, dump 
de dump de dum") and the movie talker ("You'll love this movie, baby, honest -- 
Norman dresses up as his own mother!"). 
</P>
<P>
A co-worker raised the ugly issue after an encounter with a textbook rock lout 
last weekend at Don Henley's concert at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Henley's show, on the last leg of a tour that stopped at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre last fall, was an intelligent and sophisticated effort to touch on 
a variety of serious issues, from loss of innocence (both individually and 
culturally) to bureaucratic incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
My colleague got steamed at a couple of young women seated near him who kept 
shouting requests for the few Henley hits they were familiar with ("Do 'The 
Boys of Summmmmmmmmer'!!!"), rather than take the blatantly obvious path and 
pay attention to the songs he was singing. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, you'll also encounter these oafs indoors, but for some reason, the degree 
to which they become a real nuisance seems to increase exponentially in any 
facility that doesn't have a lid on it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the balmy summer nights. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the exhilarating sight of a thousand points of light dotting the 
blanket of blue velvet up above. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the beers. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it is, the rest of us jerks who ignorantly mind our own business must 
find what little comfort we can in remembering Woody Allen's plea in "Annie 
Hall," when confronted with a pseudo-intellectual chatterbox next to him in a 
movie-theater line, for "a large sock filled with manure." 
</P>
<P>
My personal favorite experience with the despoiling effect a rock lout can have 
on a performance goes back a couple of years, when Linda Ronstadt was doing her 
'40s-themed tours of big-band music. During her concert at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, there was a particularly delicate moment when she 
was in the midst of a ballad; as I recall it was the Gershwins' melancholy 
"Someone to Watch Over Me." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed impeccably in a period gown, her hair tastefully swept up in a snood, 
Ronstadt looked longingly up into the single beam of soft blue light that 
gently illuminated her face. As the strings of the Nelson Riddle orchestra sang 
ever so sweetly, and Ronstadt prepared to deliver the next verse of this lonely 
lover's plea, up from the audience a voice came bellowing: 
</P>
<P>
"Rock and Rolllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!" 
</P>
<P>
Excuse me, are you a complete moron or are you still working on it? 
</P>
<P>
Do people like this see a marquee that reads: "Linda Ronstadt and the Nelson 
Riddle Orchestra" and buy tickets thinking it's really a secret code for Motley 
Crue? 
</P>
<P>
Or do they, perhaps, expect that after blaring out their request so tastefully 
that maybe Linda is suddenly going to drop her hand, turn to the band and say 
"OK, boys -- gimme 'Whole Lotta Love' in A and let's kick some butt this time!" 
</P>
<P>
I'm all for fans showing their appreciation for a good performance, but all too 
often a small handful of -- how can I put it delicately? -- cretins can 
diminish enjoyment for the majority with their particular brand of celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if everyone observed the following simple guidelines, there would be 
fewer sad cases like my colleague, who now argues that in terms of civility, 
the human race reached its zenith somewhere between the Bronze Age and the 
Worsted-Tweed Age. 
</P>
<P>
* If you want to be assured of hearing all of Neil Young's hits some evening, 
don't shout for them at his concert. Stay home and play the records. 
</P>
<P>
* If you feel the need to party all night long to your favorite Michael Jackson 
songs, don't stand up and shake your body down to the ground in front of all 
your comfortably seated neighbors. Stay home and play the records. 
</P>
<P>
* If you want to prove that you know the words to every one of Bonnie Raitt's 
songs -- even the one's before the "Nick of Time" album -- don't assume that 
everyone else at the concert wants to hear you, not Bonnie, sing them. Stay 
home and play the records. 
</P>
<P>
* Lastly, if you feel you simply must establish a personal bond with your 
favorite sensitive artiste, don't cry out, "We love you, Axl!" during a tender 
ballad. Observe the advice of movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn -- "If you want to 
send a message, use Western Union." 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, stay home and play the records. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Lewis' column moves to Fridays beginning next week.

FIRM ROUTINELY DENIES RENT DEPOSIT REFUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: HUNDREDS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT ELERDING PROPERTIES OF GARDEN GROVE. 
SCORES SUED AND WON COURT JUDGMENTS, BUT EVEN THE MARINES HAVE TROUBLE 
COLLECTING.

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 Orange County renters say they have been illegally denied refunds 
of their apartment security deposits by a firm run by sons of a late Newport 
Beach millionaire, noted for contributing $1.75 million to the USC football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Civil court files from Westminster to Fullerton to Laguna Hills contain at 
least 113 small claims lawsuits that have named Elerding Properties of Garden 
Grove or its officers since 1988. Of 65 cases reviewed by The Times, all 
resulted in judgments against the company. 
</P>
<P>
"No other apartment (complex) or property management (firm) comes close to the 
number of cases we hear against Elerding Properties," said Commissioner Matthew 
J. Flynn, who has presided in South County Municipal Court for the last 18 
months, hearing cases against Elerding Properties about once a week. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints lodged by military personnel grew so frequent last year that the 
Marine Corps took the extraordinary step of banning Elerding Properties from 
the service's approved housing list. From the list of 450 local apartment 
complexes and 100 hotels and motels, Elerding Properties' 10 Orange County and 
two Los Angeles County complexes are the only ones to ever be ousted, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Because Marines who live off-base receive a government rent subsidy, their 
refundable security deposits commonly consist entirely of taxpayer funds. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred other former renters have simply written Elerding Properties to 
complain about not receiving their security deposits, which range from $300 to 
$650 each, according to two employees who spoke on the condition that they not 
be identified for fear that they will be fired. 
</P>
<P>
The employees also said that office workers with the firm frequently deflect 
telephone complaints by telling callers that their cases are being handled by a 
momentarily absent clerk named "Violet." But no such person exists, the 
employees say. Several renters have addressed their letters of complaint to 
"Violet," and a few suits have included the name on the lists of defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph J. Elerding, general manager of Elerding Properties, has repeatedly 
declined to comment over the past two weeks, at one point saying, "I'm not 
talking to anybody from the news." His attorney, Arthur Morello, also had no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments owned by Elerding Properties, meanwhile, are under investigation by 
health and building authorities in response to dozens of complaints that 
conditions in several complexes are apparently substandard and in violation of 
housing codes. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Huston, assistant director of the Orange County Environmental Health 
Division, said last week that 43 complaints have been filed against Elerding 
Properties since January of last year. Huston said he recently sent the firm a 
certified letter warning that inspectors have noticed "repetitive problems" at 
its complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Huston said the most common complaints against Elerding Properties involve: 
</P>
<P>
* No heat. 
</P>
<P>
* No hot water or no water at all. 
</P>
<P>
* Overflowing trash and garbage dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
* Interior problems that include leaky ceilings, broken toilets, insect 
infestations and rotting carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Several city building inspectors have also been critical of apartments owned by 
Elerding Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that after an April inspection of the Tustin Arms complex, for 
example, building officials in the city of Orange prepared a four-page list of 
apparent housing violations that included "lack of smoke detectors . . . and 
broken and crumbling hazardous staircases, landings and walkways." 
</P>
<P>
"From our records," county official Huston said, "it seems that the conditions 
were being allowed to exist and the company was waiting to get caught. We 
cannot allow ongoing complaints of the same type to exist. It's not acceptable 
for tenants to be calling here every month to report the same problems." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Orange County Fair Housing Council say the failure of 
landlords such as Elerding Properties to promptly return refundable security 
deposits is a significant problem that contributes to homelessness in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
During its last fiscal year, the agency received 5,278 complaints of 
nonrefunded security deposits valued at about $2.85 million. (About half of the 
complaints -- often taken over the telephone and jotted down on message pads -- 
fail to identify the apartments involved. Of those that did, several hundred 
firms were named, but only one had more complaints than the five lodged against 
Elerding Properties, according to a Times review of the records.) 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these (renters) could not afford the loss of this money at a time it 
was needed for relocation," fair housing officials wrote in a recent report to 
the Orange County Community Development Council. "Consequently, hundreds faced 
homelessness due to the wrongful taking of their deposits. . . . Many managers 
have virtually institutionalized their own process so as to be in a best 
position to take a helpless tenant's money." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Elerding Properties' Garden Grove headquarters also have a 
reputation for evading efforts by the Orange County marshal's office to serve 
summonses ordering them to appear in court. In several court records, marshals 
describe firm officials as "known evaders" who have "instructed" employees not 
to let marshals enter any corporate office. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Elerding Properties has subsequently paid many former tenants 
who secured default judgments against the firm, as well as some who did not 
file suit. But other former renters have had to obtain court permission to 
garnish the funds from the firm's bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Elerding Properties owns and operates 756 apartment units in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, as well as six rental houses and two industrial centers, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
Company president Dr. Charles E. Elerding Jr., named as a defendant in many of 
the small claims suits, died on May 25 at the age of 59. A retired 
dermatologist and former Santa Ana school board member, Elerding was also the 
largest shareholder and vice chairman of the board of the Huntington 
Beach-based Liberty National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the senior Elerding was featured in Sports Illustrated when he 
and his wife, Janet R. Elerding, provided a $1.75-million endowment to the 
Trojan football team to pay the head coach's salary and provide an annual 
scholarship for the punter. The donation, school officials say, was the largest 
single contribution ever made to USC's athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Illustrated article noted that upon Elerding's retirement in 1986, 
he bought a $125,000 Rolls-Royce "and took off for weeks at a time to the 
Mexican Riviera or to San Francisco on his $700,000 yacht." His house, 
overlooking Newport Harbor from the gated community of Linda Isle, is assessed 
at $3.2 million, property records show. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1988, the article said, Elerding became ill, an illness that was 
diagnosed as cancer. Employees say that Elerding became detached from the 
operations of his property management firm soon after the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
Elerding's son Joseph, 29, now serves as general manager, and two other sons -- 
Charles III, 30, and James, 21 -- identify themselves in various records as 
managers or landlords with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County complexes owned by the firm include: Amberwood, in Buena 
Park; Casa Madrid, in Cypress; Mountain View Apartments and Villa Viejo 
Apartments, in El Toro; City Park Plaza, in Garden Grove; Huntington Apartments 
and Bahia Puerto, in Huntington Beach; Tustin Arms Apartments, in Orange; and 
Cerritos Apartments and Pine Tree Apartments, in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Among the former tenants who have sued Elerding Properties are Russell and Joji 
Logan, residents of the Mountain View Apartments from May, 1988, to July, 1989, 
when they moved to Sandy, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City. Records show that 
last September they wrote to request a refund of their $300 deposit, as 
provided in their lease. In October, they telephoned the manager to complain 
about not receiving the money and followed up with a second letter. 
</P>
<P>
In December, they made another phone call and sent another letter, this one 
addressed to "Violet" and signed by Joji Logan. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's anything you can do, send it soon, we will really appreciate it," 
Logan pleaded. "We are counting on this amount to buy our children their 
Christmas presents. Please, anything you can do to help us with this, we will 
always be thankful." 
</P>
<P>
Still receiving no reply, the couple sued Elerding Properties on Feb. 9, and 
the case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Wanda Walker, who lived with her Marine husband at Mountain View, meticulously 
documented her attempts to recover their $400 deposit before filing suit. 
</P>
<P>
Walker mailed the firm a copy of her telephone bill showing that over eight 
days from last Dec. 7 to Dec. 15 she made 27 calls to its Garden Grove 
headquarters in an effort to reach someone who could return her deposit. In a 
recent interview at the Rancho Santa Margarita Taco Bell where she works as an 
assistant manager, Walker said she won a judgment earlier this year and finally 
got her money back. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with the Marine Corps came to a head last October after the service's 
legal assistance center tried repeatedly -- but unsuccessfully -- to recover 
deposits for at least five Marines who had lived at the firm's apartments in El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Jim McClain, a public affairs spokesman, said recently that Elerding 
Properties rebuffed the Marines, refusing to answer "numerous" letters and 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"When we are dealt with in bad faith we use the avenues that are available to 
us," McClain said. "We had our legal people talk to these folks. When they did 
not respond to a number of our complaints, it gave us cause to be concerned 
about their business." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. John Pyle, a Marine lawyer, described officials of Elerding Properties as 
"obstinate," and said his efforts to recover the deposits were "like pulling 
teeth. . . . It's difficult to own a business and get away with this kind of 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
(In fact, the Better Business Bureau office serving Orange, Los Angeles, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties reports that Elerding Properties has what 
the bureau considers an unsatisfactory record. "Specifically, our records show 
a pattern of no response to customer complaints brought to its attention," 
complaint department worker Lisa McNulty wrote The Times in May.) 
</P>
<P>
On Pyle's recommendation, Marine Chief of Staff Col. J. E. Underwood took 
Elerding Properties off the Marines' approved housing list. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more Marines who live at the two complexes (in El Toro)," lawyer 
Pyle said. "When they get out of there I'm sure they'll come looking for me. 
I've told others to tell them that they can kiss their deposits goodby unless 
they are willing to go to small claims court." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Orange County Renters Assn., only one of every five tenants 
typically follows through with lawsuits when denied refundable security 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
"Most tenants do not know their rights," said Joe Caux, an association 
official. "They are afraid that they gonna lose to the landlord. When they 
don't know their rights . . . the court system is strange and scary to them." 
</P>
<P>
Under the California Civil Code, a landlord is allowed to withhold all or part 
of a renter's security deposit to cover nonpayment of rent, clean the premises 
or repair "damages to the premises, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear . . . " 
Within two weeks of the termination of a tenancy, the landlord is required to 
give every former renter an itemized statement listing the basis for any amount 
that is being withheld. 
</P>
<P>
If the code is violated, the landlord may be liable for actual damages 
sustained by the tenants, in addition to $200 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Civil Court Commissioner Flynn says officials of Elerding Properties almost 
never show up in court to even attempt to defend themselves against security 
deposit suits. 
</P>
<P>
"Why they are not here to defend the company, I really don't know," Flynn said. 
"If the case is proven and they're not here, I gave judgment to the plaintiff. 
If they ask for penalties, then I give them it also. A lot of people don't 
realize they can claim penalties." 
</P>
<P>
On a "few rare occasions," Flynn recalled, a manager of one apartment complex 
appeared on behalf of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"But she . . . added nothing to explain why the deposits have been withheld," 
Flynn said. "As a matter of fact, she said she did not know why they were 
withheld." 
</P>
<P>
Said Flynn: "I was waiting for someone to come in with a bankruptcy claim and 
say the company (Elerding Properties) is bankrupt. That would have taken the 
jurisdiction away from us. But no one ever did." 
</P>
<P>
Records obtained by The Times show that Elerding Properties has recently 
received letters from several creditors demanding settlement of overdue 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, an Anaheim elevator maintenance company that services the Mountain 
View complex has sent notice that it will do no more work until it receives a 
$640 past due payment. Elerding Properties has received similar letters from a 
swimming pool maintenance service, a temporary employment service and a 
security patrol business. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, Sally Carr's Litho Graphics of Garden Grove printed a variety of 
business forms -- including eviction notices -- for Elerding Properties until 
earlier this year, when she filed suit for nonpayment of a bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not imagine that they would act in such an unbusinesslike manner," 
Carr said recently. "I vowed never to do business with them again."

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: 1 QUESTION CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE JURY

<P>
Under Proposition 115 passed by voters on June 5, judges will now ask most of 
the questions in choosing a jury. In a way, that's too bad. Lawyers have always 
provided the most fun. 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorite jury stories involves Bob Goss, the hard-nosed deputy public 
defender, and Patty Manoukian, the former Orange County prosecutor now a judge 
in Northern California. It was a murder case, and Manoukian, eight months' 
pregnant, was by her own definition blimp-sized. Goss, a zealous advocate for 
his clients, was brazen enough to ask jurors if the fact that she was pregnant 
might affect their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
One man said he hadn't noticed she was pregnant until Goss brought it up. It 
was Manoukian -- not Goss -- who kicked that fellow off the panel. "I don't 
want anyone going over the evidence who isn't any more observant than that," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers do seem to ask a lot of meaningless questions in picking jurors. But 
sometimes you can stop one question too short. 
</P>
<P>
David Haigh of Santa Ana was defending a young Latino man in a case involving a 
jailhouse death. He asked one woman so many questions he risked the hostility 
of everyone else in the room who had to listen. Just when he finally started to 
sit down, he popped back up again. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there anything," he asked the woman, "that I did not ask, that you think we 
should know about"? I could only think of two questions he missed: Her favorite 
color and what she liked for breakfast. But the woman cocked her head to the 
side and said: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, there is one thing. I don't like Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Leonard H. McBride rolled his eyes. You couldn't tell what 
frustrated him the most: The woman's bigotry or the discovery that Haigh had 
unknowingly wasted 25 minutes of court time. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes jurors' knowledge before a trial can cost them a seat. In one 
high-profile case, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright knew everyone had 
read about it. But did they read enough to affect their judgment? One man told 
Enright he knew only that it was a complicated case. 
</P>
<P>
"But you see," Enright explained, "my job is to convince you that it's not a 
complicated case at all. If you come in here thinking that, I've already got 
two strikes against me." The man was excused from the panel. 
</P>
<P>
One young prospective juror seemed unsure why prosecutor Mike McGuire (now in 
private practice) asked about a college theory course he was taking. The 
student gladly volunteered he was a strong believer in that professor's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire bumped him off the panel. He'd had that same professor, and didn't like 
him. The student, he said, would have made a poor juror with judgment like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Too little knowledge can hurt too. One potential juror in the Randy Steven 
Kraft serial murder trial two years ago was a newspaper police reporter. But he 
didn't know the names of many of the top people on his city's police 
department. Neither side wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
Only one lawyer I ever met picked the wrong panel and still won her case. That 
was Deputy Dist. Atty. Jill W. Robers. The jury gave her the premeditated 
murder verdict she wanted. But jury members turned her down on the death 
penalty, explaining later it was because no one would ever know if the killing 
had been premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
"Bless their hearts," Roberts said. She got the half of the loaf she wanted 
most -- the conviction.

WARM REMEMBRANCES OF SLAIN GIRL, 9; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: FAMILY, FRIENDS AND PLAYMATES RECALL AUTUMN WALLACE AS BRIGHT, 
FUN-LOVING AND CONSIDERATE. THE CHILD WAS APPARENTLY KILLED DURING A BURGLARY 
AT HER HOME.

<P>
Friends, family and classmates of Autumn Wallace, a 9-year-old slain during an 
apparent burglary, remembered her Saturday as a bright, outgoing little girl 
who evoked laughter and warmth from all who knew her. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there are people like that who are so special that they teach us 
about life," the Rev. Michael Bradaric told nearly 200 people who gathered for 
the funeral at Magnolia Baptist Church. "Autumn was one of those special 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The little girl was stabbed to death June 15 at her home on Hedlund Drive in an 
unincorporated area between Stanton and Anaheim, north of Katella Avenue. 
Police believe she was killed during a burglary committed while she was alone 
in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Autumn's 18-year-old sister, April, said she arrived home from work and noticed 
several things missing from the house, including a television, videotape 
recorder and mirror. Frightened, she went across the street to a neighbor's 
house until her mother, Linda Wallace, returned home from work. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Wallace found Autumn's body in a back bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made so far. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the quiet, residential community expressed shock and many said 
they wondered how a playful little girl could be struck down by such a 
senseless and random act. 
</P>
<P>
It is a question always asked when such a young life is taken, Bradaric said. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any way our question will ever be answered," he said. "It's simply 
not possible. The sacred things of God are secret and too high for us. There 
are some things God does that we don't understand and this is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
From aisles festooned with pink and white balloons and dozens of pink and white 
roses, carnations and lilies of the valley, those who knew Autumn Wallace rose 
to share their memories. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked with her mother and Autumn came in and would always be laughing," 
Sally White said. "She would come and play with the typewriter and play office. 
We enjoyed having her here every day." 
</P>
<P>
One classmate said she liked to play tetherball with Autumn because she was 
never stingy and didn't brag about winning. 
</P>
<P>
Autumn was mature for her age: a straight "A" student at Dr. Jonas E. Salk 
Elementary School who loved to play basketball, Nintendo and other computer 
games. She enjoyed going to Chuck E. Cheese for its array of video games, 
although she hated pizza, her friends said. 
</P>
<P>
After the half-hour service, mourners filed slowly past the white, open casket 
in which Autumn clutched her favorite teddy bear. But many tendered a smile 
rather than tears. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an occasion to remind us how important it is to value the lives of our 
children," Bradaric said. "Sometimes they are remembered as a responsibility or 
a burden, but we need to remember they are a precious gift God has given us." 
</P>
<P>
Autumn Wallace was later buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cypress. An Anaheim 
group, the Anaheim Citizens Against Violent Crime Reward Trust, is offering an 
$8,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the 
killer of Autumn Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial fund has been established in her name at the Wells Fargo Bank, P.O. 
Box 629, Anaheim 92805, attention B. Mangione.

DECISION TIME FOR HUNTINGTON BEACH ON BONDS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL: SOME MEMBERS WANT TO GET GOING ON PARK AND PIER PROJECTS, BUT MAYOR 
AND OTHERS SAY THERE MIGHT BE WAYS TO AVOID DEBT.

<P>
Faced with big-ticket spending items and a small-ticket budget, the City 
Council on Monday will decide whether to put a $12-million general obligation 
bond issue to make improvements at Central Park on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed improvements would include stabilizing a former landfill south of 
the park and using that land for a new "youth sports complex." 
</P>
<P>
The council also will decide Monday night whether to pursue a $3-million 
revenue bond to help finance a park-like plaza at the base of the new municipal 
pier, which is scheduled to be built by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Erskine is leading the move to get the two bond issues rolling. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to get this on the November ballot, the council has to act by 
the second meeting in July," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members, including Mayor Thomas J. Mays, have responded coolly to 
the proposals. Mays said he prefers to wait until next year before pursuing any 
bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There may not be a need for bond issues after we look at other possibilities 
for financing some of these things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Erskine said he thinks a majority of the seven council members will support 
the bond proposals, noting that the $3-million revenue bond issue can be 
approved by council action alone. Voter approval is not required of revenue 
bonds, which are paid back by income from a specific income-producing source. 
</P>
<P>
Erskine said revenue from the restaurant, bait and snack shops planned for the 
new pier could go toward paying back the $3 million. The city would get a 
portion of those profits and that money would be used to retire the bond for 
the pier plaza, Erskine said. 
</P>
<P>
Voter approval is required of general obligation bonds, which pledge general 
city revenue to pay back those loans. So if the council approves the proposed 
$12-million bond for Central Park, it would not be issued unless city voters 
approve it in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Erskine said he is confident the park project would be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, however, takes a more cautious attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these things proposed in the park bond issue might be financed by 
public-private partnership," Mays said. He also said that methane gas in the 
landfill area could be commercially exploited. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of different ways these things can be arranged, and I think we 
should look at them first before we jump into a bond issue," Mays said. "Also, 
I was under the impression that the youth sports complex would be financed by 
its backers if the city just provided the land." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sports complex has been backed by parents of Little League 
baseball players. The group has urged the City Council to build playing fields, 
bleachers and support facilities on vacant land near Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has been warmly received by several on the council, including 
Councilman Don MacAllister. Councilman Wes Bannister also favors the idea of a 
bond issue for major improvements the city otherwise could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Jim Silva, Peter M. Green and Grace Winchell said they have 
some reservations about a bond issue this year. 
</P>
<P>
The root of the city's problem is a 1990-91 budget that forecasts very slight 
financial growth. The council last week increased trash fees from the existing 
$7.50 a month to $9.85 a month, beginning July 1, as one way to bring in more 
money. But the budget still allows no room for major expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
The city's biggest construction project is the proposed new pier, and it too 
has financing problems. The new pier is estimated to cost $12.8 million, and 
the city lacks at least $5.3 million of that, officials have said. A 
professional fund-raising organization has been hired by the city to obtain the 
remaining money needed for pier construction. 
</P>
<P>
A pier plaza, or park, at the base of the pier would cost from $2 million to $5 
million, city officials have estimated. The pier plaza is not included in the 
basic $12.8-million pier cost.

JUSTICE: SANTA ANA GETS NEEDED WORK DONE AND SAVES $100,000, AND THE 324 
LAWBREAKERS SERVE THEIR TIME OUTSIDE.

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Santa Ana boy got up early Saturday morning to paint fences. With 
the sun beaming down, he stroked away at the wooden fences and stone walls, 
covered with graffiti and gang markings, that line a 4 1/2-mile bike path. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many 16-year-olds who would scoff at spending their weekend in the 
summer heat, painting, this teen-ager seemed to be enjoying himself. For him, 
the alternative was to spend a few days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"They lock me up if I don't do this," he said, taking a brief break from his 
brush work. "This is a lot better than doing time." 
</P>
<P>
Convicted of theft charges, the youth was eight hours shy of completing his 
sentence of performing 40 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
He was but one in a crew of 18 "community service employees" assigned Saturday 
to paint over the graffiti covering the walls lining the bike path between 
Hobart Street and Edinger Avenue. The cleanup effort is part of a Santa Ana 
court's referral program that allows some defendants found guilty of 
misdemeanors to forgo jail terms by performing community work instead. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the program, the only one of its kind in Orange County, has 
324 participants and has saved Santa Ana more than $100,000 in its first six 
months of operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We provide an alternative to spending time in jail," said City Councilman 
Miguel Pulido at an informal press conference. "And the program enables us to 
do a lot more than we could do with city dollars." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Pulido said, the city is saving $45,000 by using community 
service employees to maintain the Regional Transportation Center on East Santa 
Ana Boulevard instead of contracting a company to do the work. They perform 
such duties as shampooing rugs and landscaping that were previously contracted 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The community service employees are also assigned to other city departments and 
facilities, including the library, the Santa Ana Zoo, the Fire Department and 
the Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
The length of the sentence, which varies by judge and crime committed, has 
ranged from a low of 24 hours of community service to a high of 650 hours, said 
coordinator Belam Padilla, who is in charge of the program's day-to-day 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Before receiving an assignment, workers are required to attend an orientation 
session to acquaint them with the program and city policies, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them come in with a negative attitude but leave with a more positive 
one after orientation," she said, noting that the session is also a screening 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"If they come to the orientation intoxicated, we will not allow them to 
participate," she said. "And we check to see if they have any prior affiliation 
with gangs so we don't assign them to the wrong neighborhood to remove 
graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
Participants are also required to report on time and work at least one day per 
week until their sentence is completed. While working, they are not allowed to 
smoke, have visitors or use profanity. 
</P>
<P>
The city works closely with the county Probation Department and community 
organizations, such as Turning Point and the Volunteer Center, to place court 
referrals in suitable departments. Padilla said each department using court 
referrals is monitored daily to ensure that there are no problems and that the 
work being performed is satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido said the program has been in the works for more than two years but was 
delayed while insurance, legal and other concerns were addressed. For insurance 
purposes, the participants are designated as temporary city employees but are 
allowed to perform only such activities as collecting trash, filing and mopping 
to minimize the possibility of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Once defendants have completed their required hours with the city, they receive 
letters signed by the mayor thanking them for their work, Padilla said.

NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPHER JACK D. MILLER DIES 
</P>

<P>
PLACENTIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran newspaper photographer Jack D. Miller died of cancer Friday at 
Placentia-Linda Community Hospital. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a Santa Ana resident, worked for eight California newspapers, including 
the Orange County Register, where he joined the staff as a photographer in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years he managed the Register's photo processing laboratory. He also 
worked for the Los Angeles Times, Garden Grove News, Long Beach Press-Telegram 
and Bellflower Herald Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 24, 1926, in Charleroi, Pa., Miller joined the Army Air Corps in 1941 
and flew World War II bombing missions over Germany as a tail gunner in B-17 
bombers. 
</P>
<P>
"I really admired him," said Leonard Ortiz, a Register photographer who worked 
with Miller for three years. "I did my internship here, and he was really 
patient with me. Anything you needed, he would get it." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Tehan, a Register photographer for eight years, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack was much loved by everyone on the staff," he said. "He could get you the 
things you needed to do your job. If you were down, he would occasionally bring 
in food, like a chocolate cake or a honey-baked ham, to cheer you up. 
</P>
<P>
"He never asked for money or anything. He just made it available to the whole 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
Miller is survived by his wife, Dolores; a daughter, Kimberly J. 
Miller-Hawthorne, and a son, Jack C. Miller, both of Corona; and a 
granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Another son and daughter, Michael Miller and Marla Miller, preceded him in 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Visitation will be from 5 to 9 p.m. Monday at Brown Colonial Mortuary in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Trinity Lutheran Church in Santa 
Ana.

CHILI HAS A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, BUT LOSS TO THE TIGERS SPOILS IT 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a game Angel designated hitter Chili Davis should have been able to 
savor. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Davis hit two home runs, including one that landed deep into 
the right-center field bleachers in the sixth inning. He showed some offensive 
versatility, bunting for a single in the second inning and scoring three runs 
on the night. 
</P>
<P>
But in the clubhouse afterward, Davis had the same blank look on his face as 
his teammates had following the Angels' 9-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers before 
50,527 in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to hit the ball hard a couple of times, but I wish we could have 
won the game," said Davis, whose team failed to capitalize on an opportunity to 
move within 7 1/2 games of the first-place Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"But the way I look at it, these guys have been carrying me most of the year, 
Lance (Parrish) and Wally (Joyner). Someone else has got to do something 
eventually." 
</P>
<P>
It was Fireworks Night at Anaheim Stadium, but most of the Angels, with the 
exception of Davis, were firing duds against Tiger starter Jeff Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who played at Azusa Pacific College and El Cajon Christian High 
School, had a career 3-0 record and 1.59 earned-run average against the Angels 
entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson wasn't as spectacular as he was in 1988, when he registered 10-1, 6-1 
and 6-0 victories against the Angels, but the right-hander still got the 
victory, allowing seven hits in 5 2/3 innings. Jerry Don Gleaton and Mike 
Henneman allowed three hits in the remaining 3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, I don't ever remember hitting Robinson well -- he's the toughest 
pitcher on their staff for me to hit," said Davis, who had two hits in 10 
previous at-bats against Robinson. "He has good stuff -- a decent fastball and 
good off-speed pitches to go with it." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis had Robinson's number Saturday night. He surprised him in the second 
inning, laying a bunt toward third base for a single. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to lead off when I was a rookie," Davis said. "I've always been able to 
bunt." 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Davis hit a home run over the center field fence off Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
And then Davis hit a Robinson pitch deep into the right-field bleachers in the 
sixth inning. One batter later, Robinson came out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the 13th time in his nine-year, major league career that Davis has 
hit two home runs in a game and the fifth time he has accomplished the feat as 
an Angel. Davis last hit two home runs in a game Aug. 4, 1989 against the 
Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
The three-for-four performance Saturday night also helped Davis snap out of a 
slump in which he had just five hits in his last 34 at-bats (.147) going into 
Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis walked and doubled in two-at bats Friday, and lifted his average to 
.272 with Saturday night's performance. He has nine home runs and 34 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know I was in a slump," Davis said. "I think I've been swinging 
the bat pretty well. I haven't been striking out and I've been walking a lot. 
Hits just haven't been falling in. For me, it was nothing to worry about. It 
was just a matter of time."

ORANGE COUNTY RIDERS IN SPEEDWAY QUALIFYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second round of qualifying for the world speedway motorcycle championship 
is scheduled today with four Americans competing in the Overseas Final at 
Coventry, England. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Moran of Huntington Beach, winner of the American Final at Long Beach 
three weeks ago, leads a group of Americans that also includes Ronnie Correy of 
Fullerton, Rick Miller of Reseda and Billy Hamill of Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Correy was the only American rider to qualify for the world championship last 
year, finishing in a four-way tie for eighth place. The last American to win a 
world championship was Bruce Penhall in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The top nine riders at Coventry will advance to the InterContinental Final on 
Aug. 12 at Fjelsted, Denmark. The World Final is scheduled for Sept. 1 at 
Bradford, England.

THE MARSHALL PLAN, TO REBUILD A WAR-DEVASTATED EUROPE, CHANGED AMERICA'S ROLE 
IN THE WORLD. BUT WHEN GEORGE MARSHALL ANNOUNCED THE PROGRAM, FEW REALIZED WHAT 
HIS REMARKS WOULD MEAN. ED CRAY, IN HIS BOOK 'GENERAL OF THE ARMY,' EXPLAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ed Cray, Ed Cray, author of the new book General of the Army (W.W. Norton, 
1990), from which this is excerpted, is an associate professor of journalism at 
USC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the debut of a new Opinion feature -- an excerpt of a major non-fiction 
work timed to coincide with the publication of the book's review in The Times. 
Mark A. Stoler's review of "General of the Army" appears on Page 11 of the Book 
Review section. 
</P>
<P>
The applause began at the far end of the maple- and elm-shrouded quadrangle. 
The sound rolled toward the platform on the steps of Memorial Church, swelling 
as the 8,000 in the audience recognized the tall figure heading the column of 
men to be awarded honorary degrees this pleasant June morning in 1947. George 
Catlett Marshall had come to Harvard Yard for its 286th commencement, to be 
proclaimed a doctor of laws, honoris causa. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard President James B. Conant read the citations, first in Latin, then in 
English. The last was Marshall's, the honorary degree, Conant announced, going 
to "an American to whom freedom owes an enduring debt of gratitude, a soldier 
and statesman whose ability and character brook only one comparison in the 
history of this nation." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall had agreed to speak, but insisted his not be the major address of the 
day. For all that, Marshall, never a very effective speaker when reading a 
prepared address, was to give a speech that Harvard has silently hoped 
succeeding honorees might match perhaps once a generation. 
</P>
<P>
Fumbling with his reading glasses, Marshall began with a softly spoken thank 
you for the implied comparison to George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the secretary of state set his glasses on his nose and began reading, 
slowly. "I need not tell you that the world situation is very serious . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking just the right forum, Marshall had agreed to accept the honorary degree 
shortly after his return from the Moscow foreign ministers conference six weeks 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, April 29, 1947, the secretary of state summoned George F. Kennan to 
his office at New State. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe is in a mess," Marshall told Kennan, the head of State's new Policy 
Planning Staff. "Something will have to be done." Kennan was to draw up a plan. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, Marshall was gravely concerned about Soviet intentions in Europe. 
"It was my feeling that the Soviets were doing everything possible to achieve a 
complete breakdown in Europe," he explained later, "that is, they were doing 
anything they could think of to create greater turbulence. The major problem 
was how to counter this negative Soviet policy and restore the European 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-May, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs William L. Clayton 
returned from Europe, warning of impending collapse. Clayton drafted a 
memorandum that made its way to Marshall on May 28: "It is now obvious that we 
have grossly underestimated the destruction to the European economy by the 
war." His memorandum proposed substantial economic assistance to encourage 
European industry -- a grant of "$6 to $7 billion worth of goods a year for 
three years." 
</P>
<P>
That same day Marshall met with Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson, Clayton, 
Kennan, State Department Counselor Ben Cohen and diplomat Chip Bohlen. In view 
of the situation, Marshall said in opening the discussion, they could not 
simply sit back and do nothing. What should they do? 
</P>
<P>
(Harry Truman would not play a direct role in drafting the new policy, leaving 
that to Marshall and the State Department. The President's single contribution 
was to name it. "If we try to make this a Truman accomplishment, it will sink," 
he cautioned a White House adviser. The Marshall Plan would sound "a whole hell 
of a lot better in Congress.") 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Marshall told Acheson he had accepted an invitation from 
Harvard to receive an honorary degree and would probably have to give a short 
speech. He wanted to discuss the economic crisis in Europe. From proposals by 
Clayton, Kennan and Bohlen, the secretary himself compiled his speech. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Marshall stood in Harvard Yard. The breakdown of the economic 
structure of Europe during the war was complete, Marshall told the assembly, 
and recovery seriously retarded by the lack of a peace treaty with Germany and 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Production was niggardly. Unable to buy goods they wanted, farmers were turning 
crop lands to grazing while people in the cities went hungry. Europe was forced 
to spend foreign credits on food, thereby slowing reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is that Europe's requirements for the next three or 
four years of foreign food and other essential products -- principally from 
America -- are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must 
have substantial additional help or face economic, social and political 
deterioration of a very grave character." 
</P>
<P>
To the isolationists, the secretary addressed his next comments. "Aside from 
the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of 
disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, 
the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. 
It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to 
assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which 
there can be no political stability and no assured peace." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall then extended the offer. "Our policy is directed not against any 
country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its 
purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit 
the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can 
exist." The Soviet Union and its dependencies could participate, if they chose 
to. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall turned next to what Truman considered the key section of the address, 
the new concept of formerly fierce competitors working together to foster 
economic recovery. The European countries had to jointly plan their recovery 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The initiative, I think, must come from Europe," Marshall said. "The role of 
this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of a European 
program and of later support of such a program so far as it may be practical 
for us to do so." 
</P>
<P>
The program asked much, in particular "a willingness on the part of our people 
to face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placed upon our 
country . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On the airplane to Boston, he had added what was for him a plea. America was 
insulated from a Europe of rubble, of cold, of hunger, too remote perhaps to 
grasp the urgency of the situation. "Yet the whole world's future hangs on a 
proper judgment, hangs on the realization of the American people of what can 
best be done, of what must be done." 
</P>
<P>
The grads rose to their feet, cheering, but applauding the man more than the 
speech. Few seemingly realized that the address delivered in such flat cadences 
was charting a new course in American foreign policy, summoning a generosity of 
spirit that would animate American foreign policy for decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
The European reaction came with unexpected speed. British Foreign Minister 
Ernest Bevin heard a BBC report of this "exceptionally important speech," and 
telephoned French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault. Bevin then contacted 
Vyacheslav M. Molotov in Moscow, proposing the three meet in Paris on June 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Bloc response was ambivalent. Both Poland and Czechoslovakia 
expressed interest in participating in the plan. The Soviet Union, however, was 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
Still -- and that a reflection of some debate within the Kremlin's councils -- 
Moscow did not rule out participation in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
On June 27, Molotov, Bidault and Bevin met in Paris to weigh Marshall's 
proposal. Molotov, "Old Ironpants" of a hundred stubborn negotiations, backed 
and filled for the next week, uncharacteristically indecisive. He refused to 
list Soviet assets, to state Soviet needs or, most threatening, to allow a 
central European body to set priorities in disbursing the expected U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
Molotov appeared to the other foreign ministers to be stalling, waiting for 
instructions from Moscow, warily seeking some way for the Soviet Union to sit 
at the American table. Stone-faced, he held his cards close to the vest until 
the afternoon of July 2, 1947. In the midst of a discussion of the presentation 
of their dollar needs, an aide handed Molotov what was obviously a hastily 
decoded telegram. Molotov read it, then shortly left the hall. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Molotov coldly withdrew. The Russians would not participate in 
the Marshall Plan. The plan "will lead to nothing good," he complained, but 
would "split Europe into two groups of states." 
</P>
<P>
On Josef Stalin's orders, the Czechs and Poles abruptly followed. From Moscow, 
Ambassador Walter Bedell Smith radioed Marshall that these moves constituted "a 
declaration of war by the Soviet Union on the immediate issue of the control of 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
East and West were split.

Actor-writer-director Henry Jaglom and Oscar-winner Sally Field probably would 
like to forget the project they collaborated on a quarter of a century ago: An 
episode of Gidget (Saturday at 10:30 a.m. on KTLA). Jaglom plays a folk singer 
whom Gidget (Field) recruits for a protest.

Wayne Rogers guest stars in the Gunsmoke episode "Cody's Code" (Saturday at 1 
p.m. on The Family Channel), which first aired in January, 1962. Rogers, though 
best known for "M*A*S*H," was no stranger to Westerns; he had his own, 
"Stagecoach West," in 1960-61.

RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: TRULY HAPPY DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN FANTAZIA , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The real happy days were before America discovered the Fonz. 
</P>
<P>
They were during the first season of Happy Days. Before the series became "The 
Fonzie Show," with these typical plot lines: Fonzie conquers Suicide Hill, 
Fonzie goes blind, Fonzie saves the world from nuclear destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Before the live studio audience went berserk whenever the Fonz (Henry Winkler) 
entered the set. And before "Aaaaay" became part of the language of TV 
watchers. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have forgotten what a sweet, mellow show it was will have a chance to 
rediscover the earlier "Happy Days" this week, when the series starts all over 
again on KTLA. The first episode airs Saturday at noon; the second follows. 
</P>
<P>
The first episodes showed the Cunningham familyat its '50s best: unliberated 
mother, Marion (Marion Ross); small-business owner dad, Howard (Tom Bosley); 
typical teen-ager, Richie (Ron Howard), and smart-mouth daughter, Joanie (Erin 
Moran). 
</P>
<P>
Those fans who stuck through all 10 years of the series will want to watch its 
finale (Sunday at noon), a two-parter that brings back Richie (who had left the 
series four years earlier), Al, Jenny Piccalo and Lori Beth. 
</P>
<P>
(One person you won't see in that final show is Richie's big brother, the 
not-too-bright, basketball-playing Chuck, who disappeared from the show in 1975 
and was never heard from again.)

Better scaled to TV than to the big screen, this admirable, affecting 1989 
release illuminates the lingering effects of the Vietnam War on its veterans. 
Robert De Niro (above left) stars as an uninhibited, exuberant man who 
seemingly comes out of nowhere to disrupt the ordered lives of his Vietnam 
buddy (Ed Harris, right)) and his sister (Kathy Baker). Extraordinary 
performances all around.

SO, WHAT DOES (14-MONTH-OLD) HOMER WATCH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE RHODES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until he created "The Simpsons," Matt Groening used to pretend that he never 
watched much television, that he despised the tube and everything it stood for. 
</P>
<P>
But now that he's an executive producer of one of the year's most-talked-about 
television shows, Groening, 36, is free to admit that he was indeed a product 
of a cathode ray environment, just like the rest of America born since the baby 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
"My biography could be written by consulting any TV Guide from the 1960s," 
Groening said. "Wednesday night, 7:30? I was watching 'The Flintstones.' " 
</P>
<P>
So now that he's a grown-up with a 14-month-old son of his own, what does 
Groening want his kid to watch? 
</P>
<P>
"It's okay for my son to watch whatever he wants, although I prefer that he 
watches the show I'm already watching," Groening said. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine kids learn from the example of their parents, and I really don't 
watch that much television now. And when I do I'm one of those constant 
remote-control switching people. So I guess what I don't want him to emulate is 
my exasperated behavior while I'm scrambling around trying to find the channel 
changer." 
</P>
<P>
And if Homer Groening (named after Matt's father, not Homer Simpson) adopts his 
dad's tv tastes, what will he be watching? 
</P>
<P>
"He'll like 'Pee-Wee's Playhouse,' 'Donald Duck Presents' and any PBS 
documentary featuring mischievous monkeys," Groening said. "I'd only be 
alarmed, I guess, if he wanted to watch "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
Groening doesn't think TV is detrimental to kids as long as they have other 
sources of information and entertainment. "I grew up in a household full of 
books and was surrounded by people to whom reading was very important. So 
television was not my full source of cultural nourishment." 
</P>
<P>
"And I would hope that when I subject my child to Louis Armstrong and read 
aloud to him from Charles Dickens that he'll pick up on those things as well as 
'America's Funniest Home Videos.' "

COMEDY FOR KEEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE SALTZMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Video and audio signals were thrown into the air, grabbed by TV antennas 35 
years ago and then, we thought, disappeared into the cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
And what sights and sounds these signals possessed: live drama and comedy that 
had a spontaneity and freshness never again equaled by an upstart medium 
growing into maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the live television experience was lost because videotape wasn't 
available until 1955. Quite a few TV shows, however, were filmed off the 
screen, and some of these "kinescopes" survive. They are they only record we 
have left of the "live" TV experience. 
</P>
<P>
No program lit up the airwaves with more intensity and originality than "Your 
Show of Shows," a 90-minute comedy-variety program on Saturdays from 9 to 10:30 
p.m., airing from Feb. 25, 1950, to June 5, 1954. 
</P>
<P>
"Your Show of Shows" was created by producer-director showman Max Liebman. It 
was the original "Saturday Night Live." Ninety minutes of original 
entertainment starring four startlingly original comedians: Sid Caesar, Imogene 
Coca, Carl Reiner and Howard Morris. The show was written by a group of writers 
who today dominate American mass culture: Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, 
Joseph Stein ("Fiddler on the Roof"), Michael Stewart ("Hello, Dolly!"), Larry 
Gelbart ("M*A*S*H"), Lucille Kallen and Mel Tolkin. 
</P>
<P>
Most viewers thought these live shows were lost forever. But producer Liebman 
had collected kinescopes of many of the programs. In 1976 he packaged a series 
of 90-minute TV specials for syndication. Unicorn Video has now issued eight 
volumes of these selected excerpts from "Your Show of Shows" kinescoped on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
These are not the complete original programs that included Broadway-flavored 
singing and dancing and classy snippets of ballet and opera. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pity we can't relive the entire show, singing and dancing included. But 
that's a small complaint since each tape holds seven to eight vintage comedy 
sketches featuring the genius of Caesar, Coca, Reiner and Morris and the 
writers in their prime. 
</P>
<P>
The brilliant, live and unedited comedy is all here -- from Caesar's professor 
skits to the hilarious, often flawless pantomimes to the staccato monologues to 
the sharp-tongued husband-and-wife skits to the mock-foreign language and 
silent movies and opera spoofs including ad-libs, unexpected mishaps and 
Caesar's always present, annoying cough. 
</P>
<P>
The first two volumes in Unicorn's videotape series are typical of the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
They include Caesar's "Airplane Movies," his original spoof of Hollywood's 
wartime movies that initially brought Caesar to Liebman's attention; Caesar's 
"professor," this time as an expert on fishing and archaeology; "The Boarder," 
in which wife Coca takes in boarder Morris without telling husband Caesar (this 
gets funnier with each viewing); two famous pantomimes, the "Violin Recital" 
and "In the Subway" (no one on TV ever was better at pantomime); "The Nervous 
Suitor," in which an anxious Caesar courts Coca in one of the funniest skits 
ever seen on TV; a Caesar monologue about a man caught in the city at night 
without any money; and a typical film satire in which the cast imitates foreign 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Another superb sampling of "Your Show of Shows" is a single compilation issued 
for motion picture release and now available on Media Home Entertainment 
videotape and Image Entertainment laser disc: "Ten From Your Show of Shows," a 
compilation of comedy sketches from 1950 to 1954. 
</P>
<P>
These tapes meet the crucial home video test: They get better viewing after 
viewing. They offer expert testimony that "Your Show of Shows" was indeed the 
extraordinary achievement viewers remember, a genuine classic of television's 
golden age. 
</P>
<P>
The modern-day counterpart to "Your Show of Shows" was producer Lorne Michaels' 
"Saturday Night Live." We are now able to evaluate this live comedy repeatedly 
through the unprecedented release of 16 volumes of "Saturday Night Live," circa 
1975-1980, Warner videotape, 60 minutes each. 
</P>
<P>
Watching these volumes of "Saturday Night Live" as well as "The Best of John 
Belushi," "The Best of Dan Aykroyd" and "The Best of Gilda Radner," also on 
Warner Home Video, it becomes clear that, like "Your Show of Shows," the comedy 
that flashed once on the screen and then disappeared holds up very well. For 
the most part, it is clever, inventive, daring, hard-edged and unpredictable: 
the Coneheads or the Aykroyd-Curtain "Point Counterpoint" or Mr. Bill or 
"cheesebugah, cheesebugah, cheesebugah" or Radner's "Never Mind" or Murray's 
Nick Winters or the Loopners or the parodies of presidents, network executives 
and, best of all, television past, reminds you of the razor-sharp, often gross, 
contemporary comedy that commercial TV had never seen before and may never see 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Its elements were classic (political satire, a keen distrust of the 
establishment, especially business and corporations, including TV corporate 
power) and revolutionary (a stripping away of all show-biz conventions and 
formalities; a conscious attempt to turn the medium inside out with 
behind-the-scenes gallows humor; a new all-embracing and permissive attitude 
toward sex and, especially, drugs). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best collection is "The Best of John Belushi" featuring classic 
Belushi sketches from October, 1975 to May, 1979. Included are, of course, the 
Blues Brothers. And its highlight is Belushi in a 1978 Tom Schiller film called 
"Don't Look Back in Anger," in which Belushi visits the 
Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time cemetery. It is a poignant gem.

SERIOUS REFORMS FOR A SERIOUS PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
SHERIFF BLOCK OFFERS IMPORTANT NEW ANTI-CORRUPTION PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This has been a difficult year for Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and 
his more than 7,000 deputies. However, in the wake of a new reform agreement 
between the department and the unions representing its deputies, the outlook 
for the department has begun to brighten. 
</P>
<P>
The problems afflicting the sheriff's department include a series of incidents 
in which deputies were found to have used excessive force in the course of 
arrests. But the most damaging scandal arose from allegations that officers 
assigned to narcotics units have been skimming money seized from drug dealers. 
Ten of the deputies involved -- seven of them members of a single elite unit -- 
have been named in a 27-count federal indictment. Altogether, the department 
has suspended 26 deputies assigned to drug units. 
</P>
<P>
All of this has raised serious questions about Block's management of the 
department and about the Board of Supervisors' ability to exercise appropriate 
oversight of its activities. The agreement, which ratifies a proposal by Block, 
is a welcome first step toward resolution of these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, which still must be approved by the 
supervisors, deputies would be limited to five years service in all vice and 
special investigations units. Members of special weapons teams would serve 
seven years. At least half the indicted deputies had been in their narcotics 
unit for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports, negotiators for the department and its unions have yet to 
reach an accord on the second of Block's reform proposals, which would require 
financial disclosure by officers posted to sensitive assignments -- including 
narcotics -- as well as by their spouses. The indicted deputies are alleged to 
have been living well beyond their legal means, and knowledge of that fact 
would have helped sound an early warning that there were problems. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies' union opposes such disclosure, however, and its members are said 
to object strongly to the imposition of disclosure on spouses. Clearly, 
delicate questions are involved. But, since 1986, federal courts have upheld 
the right of police agencies to require financial disclosure by certain 
officers. In a community property state like California, it is difficult to see 
how such a requirement could not extend to spouses. 
</P>
<P>
Restoring ruptured bonds of trust is never an easy or pleasant process. The 
first step is admitting that trust, in fact, has been shattered. Sheriff 
Block's new proposals represent such an admission and they ought to be given a 
chance to prove their worth.

HERE'S HELP, WITH A PARENT'S, YET KID-FRIENDLY, GUIDE TO SUMMERTIME VIEWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARI GRANVILLE, Kari Granville is a New York-based writer specializing in 
writing about children's television. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many parents actually may survive the summer without having to attend to a 
single case of poison oak or swimmer's ear. Few, however, will escape that more 
insidious seasonal nuisance: summertime TV. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how parents plan to prevent their kids from squandering the summer 
vacation in front of the TV -- by scheduling endless activities, letting the 
kids live in the pool or simply locking up the set -- they sooner or later see 
the folly of their schemes. The vigilance required to control the TV set lends 
the effort that air of futility common to all struggles against nature; parents 
might just as well try to keep bees from a rose garden. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, kids eventually will make time to watch TV. If denied cartoons, 
they'll just get up earlier to watch them. They'll misplace their shoes, among 
other tactics, to delay banishment from the house. They'll suddenly heed 
warnings connecting eating and swimming to stomach cramps, and insist on giving 
lunch one more TV show's worth of time to settle before they jump back into the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
Even without VCRs, rarely an hour passes when TV doesn't have something 
fetching (if not necessarily suitable) for children, unlike 20 years ago when 
the dearth of anything but soap operas and old movies at midday drove kids 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Nickelodeon, a basic cable channel, and the Disney Channel, a pay-cable 
channel, provide children's entertainment throughout the day, while dozens of 
other cable outlets and broadcast stations show cartoons, game shows, reruns 
and movies that appeal to children. 
</P>
<P>
The best that parents may be able to do, considering the circumstances, is to 
steer their children toward fun, entertaining shows that are untainted by 
violence, innuendo, lurid subject matter or mere stupidity. In other words, 
they might want to take the time to find shows that are more appropriate for 
school-age children than, say, reruns of "Charlie's Angels" or installments of 
"Sally Jessy Raphael." 
</P>
<P>
This, too, demands vigilance, but there is a reward for those who succeed. Any 
parent who makes it through the next few months without hearing the "Gilligan's 
Island" theme song can rest peacefully, knowing he or she has done his bit for 
the preservation of a young mind; any parent who doesn't deserves the 
aggravation the song invariably induces. 
</P>
<P>
This somewhat abbreviated list assumes a lot: that parents are aware that 
anything made by Children's Television Workshop ("Sesame Street" or "3-2-1 
Contact") won't just entertain, but might even teach kids something; that 
anything with Jim Henson's name attached ("Fraggle Rock," 5:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. 
daily TNT) might even be enriching; that any kids' show on PBS ("Wonderworks" 
or "Reading Rainbow") has good production values; that the "New Mickey Mouse 
Club" on the Disney Channel (5:30 p.m. weekdays) is entertaining. So beyond the 
assumptions% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW SHOWS 
</P>
<P>
The new children's TV season won't start until fall, except at Nickelodeon, 
which gets a jump on the competition this summer. The channel plans to kick off 
two new series, transform a weekly show into a daily one and start new seasons 
for at least two of its returning programs. 
</P>
<P>
Premieres for two shows are scheduled for July 4: "SK8 TV," everything kids 
would want to know about skateboarding, at 9 a.m. and repeated at noon, 4 and 7 
p.m.; and "Wild and Crazy Kids," described as a sort of a "That's Incredible!" 
for kids, at 9:30 a.m., 12:30, 4:30 and 7:30 p.m. The half-hour "SK8 TV" will 
air regularly at 6:30 p.m. Saturdays, beginning July 7. "Wild and Crazy Kids" 
assumes its regular time slot, noon and 6:30 p.m. Sunday, July 8. 
</P>
<P>
Both new shows should benefit from the fact they follow Nickelodeon's popular 
adventure/sitcom series "Hey, Dude," about a group of teen-agers who work on a 
dude ranch. New episodes begin in July, when two new cast members make their 
debut. The show airs at 6 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Also, fresh episodes of "Eureeka's Castle," Nickelodeon's 10 - 11 a.m. weekday 
offering (7-7:30 a.m.) for pre-schoolers, will begin in August. The series 
features a huge cast of puppets, among them an apprentice sorceress named 
Eureeka whose spells never quite work as they should. 
</P>
<P>
Although the time has not yet been selected, Nickelodeon plans to add a new 
weekday show, "Daily Panic," a half-hour version of "Total Panic," the 
channel's Sunday morning game/cartoon/talk show in which the studio audience 
participates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MOVIES AND LIMITED SERIES 
</P>
<P>
Scouring the TV listings will yield a surprising abundance of films and special 
series for kids that may have previously been overlooked because of competition 
from the better-known syndicated cartoons and reruns. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Channel Premiere Film series is a source of richly detailed and 
emotionally satisfying movies that often harken back to classic children's 
fare. This summer watch for "Back Home," featuring Disney child star Hayley 
Mills as a British mother trying to help her daughter adjust to life following 
World War II. The movie airs this week at 9 a.m. Tuesday and 4 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
True classics can be found on a couple of stops on the dial. Monday through 
Saturday, check out the 5 p.m. movie on The Family Channel; it might be a film 
such as "Black Beauty" or "The Last of the Mohicans." The Movie Channel has its 
Cliff Notes Theater, which presents adaptations of classic literature such as 
"Ivanhoe" and "The Yearling." And in the coming months the Arts &amp; 
Entertainment Network plans to air such films as "Little Lord Fauntleroy," 
"Long John Silver" and "Captain Kidd." 
</P>
<P>
Children may also be swept away by "Avonlea," a Disney Channel series about a 
city girl who is sent to live with relatives on rural Prince Edward Island 
during the Victorian era. The series is an offshoot of the immensely popular 
and critically acclaimed "Anne of Green Gables" and "Anne of Avonlea" 
miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Showtime will continue its animated "Storybook Classics" during the summer. 
"The Ugly Duckling," narrated by Cher, airs at 4 p.m. June 21, 25 and 5:30 a.m. 
June 22, 26. "The Emporer and the Nightingale" and "Steadfast Tin Soldier" will 
be shown in July. 
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday mornings, at 8:30, HBO is presenting "The Wonderful Wizard of 
Oz," an animated series based on the L. Frank Baum books. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SERIES, OLD AND NEW 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the most troublesome categories of TV when it comes to kids. 
Frequent violence is the only criterion used to judge whether these shows are 
fit for kids, and while many may not be overtly harmful, they often lack any 
worth beyond mere diversion. Any show a parent deems too dumb for adult 
consumption should be so deemed for a child, too. 
</P>
<P>
In prime time, the one sitcom that surpasses expectations for the genre and 
interests older children is "The Wonder Years," a remembrance of youth that 
rings true for the young and old. It airs at 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays on ABC. For 
prime-time drama, ABC also has "Life Goes On," about a middle-class family 
riding out the rather ordinary ups and down of life, which airs at 7 p.m. 
Sundays on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
On weekdays, several shows from the days when TV producers were more mindful of 
young viewers -- and censors -- are still engaging to kids. 
</P>
<P>
"Father Knows Best" is sometimes derided as unrealistic, but what's so bad 
about a family that acts civil? Repeats air from noon to 1 p.m. weekdays on The 
Family Channel, which also airs an hour of the old "Batman" series, so camp 
that even young children get the joke, beginning at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The Andy Griffith Show" appears frequently on weekdays: at 5:30 a.m. and 10 
a.m. on KTTV, and 3:30 p.m. TBS. What's more wholesome than Aunt Bea's apple 
pie? 
</P>
<P>
Another crowd pleaser, of course, is "Leave It To Beaver," on weekdays at 6:30 
a.m. on WGN and 8:30 a.m. on KTLA. Nickelodeon carries those other perennial 
favorites, "Lassie," 6 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. weekdays, and "Dennis the Menace," at 
7 p.m. weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
For drama, repeats of "Little House on the Prairie" air at 11 a.m. weekdays on 
KTLA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ANIMATION 
</P>
<P>
Most of Disney's animation is a good bet, whether classic cartoons on the 
Disney Channel or the current syndicated series "Duck Tales" and "Chip 'n 
Dale's Rescue Rangers," which follow one another weekdays beginning at 4 p.m. 
on KCAL. Also, Disney Channel offers an animated "Fraggle Rock" series at 9 
a.m. Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, look to Nickelodeon and some of its animated imports for 
interesting weekday cartoons. Young children seem especially fond of "Maya the 
Bee" at 9:30 a.m., and "David the Gnome," at noon, followed by "The Adventures 
of the Little Koala." Other shows such as "Inspector Gadget," at 7:30 a.m. and 
5:30 p.m., and "Heathcliff," at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., hold more interest for older 
kids.

CAREERS: CYCLING GOLD MEDALIST MARK GORSKI SWITCHES GEARS AND STARTS A NEW 
CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Mark Gorski's working wardrobe was spandex shorts, skin-tight 
jerseys and funny looking shoes with large front cleats. His equipment was a 
custom-made bicycle with no brakes, built for speed. 
</P>
<P>
Today he wears business suits, drives an expensive car and carries a briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
He used to talk about 50-tooth gears and 200-meter intervals. Now he discusses 
investment parameters and trust portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Until last fall he was America's most decorated sprint cyclist, an Olympic gold 
medalist and a celebrity on the velodrome circuit. Now he's a retired athlete 
in his rookie year in investment management. 
</P>
<P>
He appears to have landed on a winning team. Gorski, 30, is one of three former 
athletes hired for Wells Fargo Bank's Asset Management Division, a group of 14 
people throughout California handling large-asset investments for groups and 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Where he used to spend his days cycling from Newport Beach to the Olympic 
Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills for sprint workouts, Gorski now drives 
the South Bay area from Long Beach to Marina del Rey, or puts in long hours at 
his desk at Wells Fargo Center in downtown Los Angeles, selling potential 
investors on his company's program. 
</P>
<P>
Gorski competed in his last race in October, in the international NEC 
Invitational at the Olympic Velodrome. He planned to continue racing into this 
summer's Goodwill Games, next year's Pan Am Games and maybe the '92 Olympics, 
but an odd premonition came over him that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I wasn't going anywhere in the sport," he said. "I had a hard time 
motivating myself. I wasn't even nervous before races. That was a bad sign. As 
we were leaving for the race this really strange feeling came over me and I 
told my wife, 'I think this is gonna be my last race.' It really surprised 
her." 
</P>
<P>
It was prophetic as well. Gorski hung up his cycling shoes, and began looking 
around for business opportunities. As one of the sport's few spokesmen with 
viable sponsors, he considered positions associated with the business side of 
cycling. 
</P>
<P>
Through a friend of a friend he met at the 1984 Olympics, Gorski was introduced 
to the Wells Fargo group and did well in what he describes as a rigorous 
interview process. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gorski is busy finding and advising investors, learning on the job and 
continuing to think big. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on the job from Day One. There was no real training," he said. "I 
see a wide variety of people. It's important to be credible, professional, 
accommodating. If you come in as a slick salesman you're not gonna get 
anywhere. What it's all about is pushing yourself, making as much contact as 
possible and providing ongoing service. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for something with unlimited upward potential, where the amount 
of time you put into it, the better you do. Like sports. I'm only now beginning 
to appreciate what athletics gives you -- self-confidence, the ability to deal 
with pressure, those kinds of things." 
</P>
<P>
The way had been paved for Gorski by two former pro football players in the 
Asset Management Division, Bill Ring and Paul McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Ring, 33, who retired from the San Francisco 49ers in 1987, has become the 
top-earning salesman in the division. Ring had been preparing for a financial 
career while playing football, working in investment firms during the 
off-season. His success prompted Wells Fargo to hire his friend, former USC 
quarterback Paul McDonald, straight out of the NFL last year. McDonald has 
risen to the division's No. 2 revenue producer. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old McDonald works the Orange County area and, Gorski said, has 
been something of a mentor to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in absolutely cold," McDonald said. "A lot of our colleagues had horror 
story after horror story about losing their money (while playing) through bad 
investments, agents who made bad decisions. The impetus was the idea of helping 
players with investments. Bill shared the same concerns about athletes and we 
had a few conversations about the direction I could take." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald was looking at another job when Ring persuaded him to talk to his 
supervisor at Wells Fargo, Art Rutzen. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought a bank could do a good job in that arena," McDonald said. "I 
was pleasantly surprised." 
</P>
<P>
And he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
Rutzen, a former wrestler, said he had no qualms about hiring untrained jocks. 
"I made the transition from athlete to Wall Street. All that extra work and 
drive transferred over," he said. "I look for intrinsics in people, not 
substantive knowledge. Show me somebody who's a superstar in one arena and 
obviously intelligent, and they can be a superstar in another arena. Especially 
(athletes), who make it on heart, not just talent. They'll sublimate all that 
drive that they put into winning a gold medal or a Super Bowl into a new 
arena." 
</P>
<P>
Rutzen, a senior vice president, said that his division accounts for about 10% 
of Wells Fargo's profits -- which were $700 million in the last fiscal year -- 
and that it is the fastest growing profit area of the bank, with the prospect 
of continuing to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Rutzen said Gorski has fit right in. "He's going great guns. He hit this with a 
bang," Rutzen said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorski, who had done a fair amount of marketing and sales work with his cycling 
sponsors and had dabbled in real estate as well, was probably better suited for 
his new career than most athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for the majority it's intimidating to leave your circle and start at 
the bottom," he said. "There were times I've wondered what I was doing. It 
wasn't easy. But I'm glad I gave it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been great having guys like McDonald and Ring to talk to. Paul came cold 
to the business. I think there were some raised eyebrows (when he was hired). 
The fact he's been so successful speaks well of Art and really helped me." 
</P>
<P>
As an articulate and attractive spokesman, Gorski has long been one of the best 
salesmen for cycling in general and for the track tour's sponsors as well. He 
remains a member of the U.S. Cycling Federation board and could have continued 
to make a living in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
But while road racers -- notably Tour de France hero Greg Lemond -- have gained 
wide acclaim, track cyclists continue to struggle for backing and recognition. 
</P>
<P>
It hit home for Gorski when his 7-year-old son, Alex -- who took a victory lap 
on his father's shoulder in the 1984 Olympics -- told him he'd like to be 
called "Ryne" -- as in baseball star Ryne Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Track racing is going through a tough time," Gorski said. "Most of the quality 
guys are on the road -- and they've turned pro. Guys are not staying amateur 
very long. There are so many more opportunities as a road rider. If I were 
coming up now, with the way they're changing Olympic rules and amateur rules, I 
don't think I'd stay amateur very long. The major sponsors have dropped their 
sponsorship. It's an exciting sport but it just hasn't come as far as I hoped. 
I can't explain it." 
</P>
<P>
Gorski, who competed from his early teens, said that for a while it was 
difficult not to work out. Most of his exercise now is limited to weekends, 
riding in the Newport Beach area where he lives with his wife Mary and children 
Alex and Kate, 3. 
</P>
<P>
"It took some getting used to," he said. "The first couple months (away from 
competition) was like withdrawal. It took some getting used to. I'd had a 
routine for a long time. But I don't miss all the travel. While I was cycling I 
was away -- a lot. Now I may work long hours, but I see my family every day." 
</P>
<P>
Gorski stays in touch with other velodrome veterans and misses the camaraderie 
of riding. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport has been great to me," he said. "I wouldn't trade the experience for 
anything. It was a great life But it was just time to find something else."

FORMER LOYOLA TEAMMATES A 1-2 PUNCH IN YANKEE ORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
It happened so quickly that Don Sparks didn't have time to say goodby to Bob 
DeJardin, his good friend and long-time teammate. 
</P>
<P>
When the phone rang in Sparks' hotel room in Canton, Ohio, at 7 a.m. Wednesday, 
the voice on the other end was telling Sparks to pack his bags for nearby 
Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
He was being called up to triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
"It had no notion it was going to happen," Sparks said. "I thought it was going 
to be another joke, where the coaches call you down to the lobby with all your 
luggage for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Sparks took a 20-second shower, threw some clothes into a bag and headed to the 
lobby. But it wasn't a joke. The car was waiting outside to take him to 
Columbus -- only a step away from the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
He's been at Columbus ever since, splitting up -- at least temporarily -- a 
partnership between Sparks and DeJardin that has spanned much of the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks and DeJardin were teammates at Loyola Marymount in 1987 and '88. Sparks 
was the third baseman with the booming bat; DeJardin the switch-hitting, 
slick-fielding shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
They were selected by the New York Yankees in the June 1988 draft -- Sparks in 
the fifth round and DeJardin in the eighth. Sparks spent the rest of that 
summer in the class-A Carolina League at Prince William, Va., and DeJardin 
headed north to Oneonta, N.Y., a class-A team in the New York-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
The two were reunited last year at Prince William, then were promoted this 
season to the Yankees' double-A affiliate at Albany-Colonie of the Eastern 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks and DeJardin spent most of the year sharing a house in Burnt Hills, 
N.Y., about 20 minutes outside of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks' car is still there, and so are most of his clothes. He has no idea how 
he is going to retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got one bag of clothes," Sparks said. "It looks like I'm going to be 
doing a lot of wash for a while, but I'm not complaining." 
</P>
<P>
Sparks was called to Columbus after the Yankees put outfielder Claudell 
Washington on the disabled list and recalled third baseman Mike Blowers from 
Columbus to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, at least, Sparks gets to travel on airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
DeJardin is still riding buses on the long road trips -- although 
Albany-Colonie's bus is air-conditioned and has three television sets. Still, 
it might not be long before DeJardin and Sparks are back together again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pumped up for Don," DeJardin said. "He's a good friend. Hopefully I'll get 
my shot soon." 
</P>
<P>
Sparks has not taken long to make an impact at Columbus. He has two hits in 
seven at-bats, both of them doubles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be thought of as a young pup just coming up, who's kind of 
scared about getting a chance," Sparks said. "When I put on the uniform, I want 
to be part of the team, and I want to help out the team." 
</P>
<P>
In 58 games at Albany-Colonie, Sparks was hitting .277 with three home runs, 10 
doubles and 24 runs batted in. When Sparks was called up to Columbus, 
Albany-Colonie had a five-game losing streak, which is why Sparks thought the 
coaches might have been playing a trick on him to help lighten up the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, a standout at Millikan High in Long Beach, put too much pressure on 
himself in 1988 -- his first year in professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He ended up hitting only .247 the summer after setting a Loyola school record 
-- broken this year by Rick Mediavilla -- with 105 hits as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
But Sparks' coaches at Prince William helped turn him around. They said he only 
needed to get some at-bats under him to get used to the wooden bats at the 
long-distance road trips. 
</P>
<P>
The next year at Prince William, Sparks was re-teamed with DeJardin on the 
right side of the infield. He responded by hitting .281 with six homers and 65 
RBI. 
</P>
<P>
He has also been experimenting with glasses since he can't find a pair of 
contact lenses to correct his astigmatism. The glasses help Sparks pick up the 
rotation on the curve ball. 
</P>
<P>
"When that fastball starts looking like a curve ball, and the curve starts 
looking like a fastball, it's time to get some glasses," Sparks said. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Sparks could find himself in Yankee Stadium by the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees have experimented with three third basemen this season -- Randy 
Velarde and rookies Blowers and Jim Leyritz -- with varied results. Blowers 
committed four errors in one game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying not to think about it, too much," Sparks said. "I can't control 
whatever moves the Yankees make, so I'm just going to play real hard here and 
try to have some fun." 
</P>
<P>
This season has been especially enjoyable for DeJardin, who has been successful 
hitting against Eastern League pitching. 
</P>
<P>
DeJardin is Albany-Colonie's starting shortstop and leadoff man and is hitting 
.318 in 34 games after missing the start of the season with a sore arm. He has 
a .417 on-base percentage and has stolen six bases. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Mater Dei High, DeJardin was a .324 hitter in his four-year 
career at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
He was signed by then-Yankee scout Chris Smith, who took over the head coaching 
job at Loyola a week after signing DeJardin. 
</P>
<P>
DeJardin hit .278 last year at Prince William and hit .295 in 1988 at Oneonta. 
</P>
<P>
Albany-Colonie is a far cry from Oneonta, a college town where DeJardin was 
booted out of his campus apartment when the students returned from summer 
break. DeJardin spent the rest of the summer living in a portable trailer at 
Oneonta's home field. 
</P>
<P>
DeJardin is a contact hitter whose blend of speed and fielding savvy could earn 
him a ticket to Columbus in the near future. He has been promoted steadily 
through the Yankees' ranks so far. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made another step each year," DeJardin said. "I think the Yankees are 
happy with my play. They've treated me great so far." 
</P>
<P>
Still, DeJardin and Sparks have their share of minor league horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them revolve around Prince William -- and the bus from hell. 
</P>
<P>
"It was grueling," DeJardin said. "It would break down all the time and we'd 
just be stuck there, sitting on the side of the road." 
</P>
<P>
The air conditioner didn't work too well either, which can be a big problem in 
the South during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"At first it was like, 'Welcome to the minor leagues,' " Sparks said. "After a 
while, though, you get tired of it and start mumbling under your breath." 
</P>
<P>
Sparks recalled a time when Prince William's bus broke down on a road trip and 
the team was stranded for five hours at a car dealership, waiting for the 
mechanic to come along to fix the bus. 
</P>
<P>
"That was scary," Sparks said. "Guys were getting hungry and mad. After a while 
you started seeing guys hanging all over these brand new cars, and playing 
games with them." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, DeJardin and Sparks have had each other to lean on -- until 
Wednesday, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"I show a little more emotion after a game than Don does," DeJardin said. 
"Don's a fun guy to be around with his dry sense of humor. He'd help to keep me 
loose. Nothing seems to bother him, even if he had a bad night." 
</P>
<P>
They also helped each other battle homesickness. During the winters, they live 
within a 15-minute drive of each other, so on the long bus rides around the 
east they would talk about home -- DeJardin missing his fiancee and Sparks 
missing his family and friends in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when you'd just want to jump on the first flight home," 
Sparks said. "So we'd look to each other for support." 
</P>
<P>
Until the Yankees make a move with DeJardin, the two might be a little more 
lonely. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to keep on playing, waiting for my shot," DeJardin said.

NBA TEAMS LIKE WHAT THEY SEE IN KIMBLE; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: LOYOLA MARYMOUNT STAR SHOWS HE CAN HANDLE ALL THE ATTENTION AS WELL 
AS HE HANDLES A FULL-COURT PRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life has been hectic for Bo Kimble since he was thrust into the public 
consciousness after the death of Hank Gathers, his boyhood friend, last March 
during a Loyola Marymount basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Since capturing the heart of the nation as he led Loyola Marymount into the 
NCAA West Regional final, the marketing of Kimble has begun in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble has signed with Management Plus Enterprises, which represents such 
high-profile sports stars as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, former Laker center, Akeem 
Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets, Ronnie Lott of the San Francisco 49ers and 
Ahmad Rashad, the former pro football player turned sportscaster. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble's agents have kept him so busy that he conducts interviews from his 
mobile phone as he scurries to his appointments. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been incredibly busy," Kimble said. "Opportunities have really come to 
the forefront. I even have more offers now that what's been published." 
</P>
<P>
His earlier appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show" will soon be followed by 
another, during which he and Hall will discuss Kimble's role in "Heaven Is a 
Playground," a basketball movie to be released next spring. Filming begins next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe he'll be talking to Johnny Carson about his book, which is in the 
preliminary stage. Kimble was in New York last week to negotiate with a 
publisher for the rights to his story about his friendship with Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
From New York it was off to Boston, where he was interviewed by Celtic 
officials. That was followed by a trip to New Jersey, where he spoke to the 
Nets, who have the top pick in Wednesday's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
Willis Reed, Nets' vice president for basketball operations, was impressed with 
Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll be a lottery pick," Reed said of Kimble. "Exactly where he'll 
go, I'm not sure. I know we like him. But probably based on where we are and 
what our needs are, we'll probably end up taking a big player instead of a 
shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's an excellent player. He's got good quickness and he's got a pro body. 
He's very good around the basket and he's got good range on his shots." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said that Kimble's NBA value rose after his performance in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he proved to people that despite all the problems, in terms of going 
through the tragedy of losing a close friend and teammate, he was still able to 
handle that and still stay focused on his basketball," Reed said. "You have to 
be proud of him for that." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"People knew that I had a fantastic year and was very consistent, but they 
learned about me as a person," Kimble said. "Now that they understand me as a 
person, it has made my value as a basketball player go up as well." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble has also met with the Miami Heat, Utah Jazz, Atlanta Hawks, Dallas 
Mavericks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves and the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Clippers have a group of great young talent and it would be wonderful to 
be a part of that and to develop into a really good team," Kimble said. "I want 
to stay in L.A. It would be a fantastic situation for me. I would be 
tremendously happy with that." 
</P>
<P>
What with meetings with NBA teams, book publishers and movie executives, does 
Kimble have trouble staying focused on basketball? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," Kimble said. "The only difficult thing has been all the traveling and 
all the obligations. But I always have time for basketball. Basketball is by 
far the No. 1 thing in anything I do." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble will compete in the One-on-One Collegiate Challenge on Monday in 
Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Other players entered are Lionel Simmons of La Salle, Sean Higgins of Michigan, 
Travis Mays of Texas, Chris Jackson of LSU, Willie Burton of Minnesota, Gary 
Payton of Oregon State and Bimbo Cole of Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
The winner gets $100,000, the runner-up $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Next on Kimble's calendar is Wednesday's NBA draft. The NBA has asked him to 
attend because he is expected to be one of the top selections. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he'll go in the lottery somewhere," said Marty Blake, NBA director of 
scouting, 
</P>
<P>
calling Kimble one of the top shooting guards in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"He shoots the ball well," Blake said. "I feel he's like Jeff Malone of the 
Washington Bullets. He looks like he's not really playing hard, but he's an 
intense player and he can pass the basketball. I just don't think that he's the 
type of player who's a problem evaluating." 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot 5-inch guard, Kimble led the nation in scoring with a 35.3-point 
average last season, and had four 50-point games. 
</P>
<P>
His shooting has impressed NBA executives. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, guys who can shoot the ball are like home run hitters," said Frank 
Layden, Utah Jazz president. "And home run hitters can always make a living in 
the league. He's a long-range shooter who wants the ball in tough situations." 
</P>
<P>
His value already established in the NCAA tournament, Kimble could have 
bypassed the NBA's evaluation camp and All-Star game in Orlando, Fla., without 
hurting his draft value. Still, he chose to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to know one thing," he said. "I wanted to know the level of 
competition that was there. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a lot of doubts about my defense and I wanted to make sure that there 
were no doubts about the way I played defense and I didn't want to hide 
anything. I wanted to put myself in the best possible position come draft day." 
</P>
<P>
NBA scouts were impressed with Kimble's performance at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he helped himself by coming to Orlando and playing in the All-Star 
classic," Blake said. "He played very well, especially in view of the fact that 
he showed up at a time when he was getting over a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Because Kimble played in Loyola Marymount's fast-break offense, NBA scouts 
think he'll have no problem adjusting to pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Kimble is showing that he's a coachable player who can fit in with whatever 
system you use," said Brad Greenberg, director of scouting for the Portland 
Trail Blazers. "He and Kendall Gill (of Illinois) are at the top of the list 
for off guards." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Sund, vice president of the Dallas Mavericks, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He can score inside or outside, and obviously, since he led the country in 
scoring, you know he is talented offensively," Sund said. "He played a lot of 
forward but did play some guard. Most of the NBA seems to see him as an off 
guard. He's an excellent free throw shooter and a good competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry West, Laker general manager, is impressed with Kimble, but Kimble 
probably won't be around by the time the Lakers draft. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really a very fine prospect," West said. "He had a great career at Loyola 
and obviously, because of the system they use, he proved that he can play in a 
game where there's a lot of room and where his individual skills really show. 
Those are things in an open game where a kid either prospers or he fails 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it tells you he's pretty good because he can do things when there's 
some room out there. He doesn't need one specific kind of a system for him to 
prosper in." 
</P>
<P>
Does Kimble have a down side? Is there anything he doesn't do well? 
</P>
<P>
"He'll have to learn to play a little different than the way he played at 
Loyola Marymount," said Reed of the Nets. "If he's going to play (shooting) 
guard he's got to learn to defend people off screens. Most guys, I don't care 
how good a program they come out of, they have to learn to play in the NBA, 
where they set two and three screens for the shooters. But I don't think he'll 
have any problems learning to defend off screens." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever he has to learn, it doesn't figure to be as difficult for Kimble as 
surviving the death of his closest friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss Hank not being part of the excitement of the draft," Kimble 
said. "But I still think about him a lot."

<P>
The wheel has almost come full circle for Diego Armando Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he must either silence the critics by proving that he still is the 
world's top player or forever relinquish that claim. 
</P>
<P>
The second round of the World Cup has produced two dramatic pairings: Brazil 
against Argentina in Turin today, followed by West Germany against the 
Netherlands in Milan. Between them, the four teams have won the World Cup seven 
times and finished second six times. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow, two of them head home. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of many, Maradona and his Argentine teammates will be looking 
for a flight to Buenos Aires come Monday morning. Based on the teams' 
comparative performances to date, Brazil must be considered an overwhelming 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a dismal tournament for the defending world champions, and 
especially for the player whom many regard as the world's finest. The team was 
stunned by Cameroon in the World Cup opener, recovered to defeat the Soviet 
Union, then was held to a tie by Romania and barely squeaked into the second 
round with a third-place finish in its group. 
</P>
<P>
For Maradona, the nightmare has been even worse. Not only has he played poorly, 
but, as in Mexico four years ago, he once again has been accused of cheating. 
</P>
<P>
One headline last Friday in "The European," a new weekly newspaper, said what 
many believed to be true: "Magical Maradona Loses His Power." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it does seem as if "the little man," to use the term preferred by the 
British media, has lost much in stature, not to mention reputation. Four years 
ago, the 5-foot-6, 140-pound Maradona was on top of the world, having achieved 
his lifelong ambition by captaining Argentina to a World Cup triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Today he must either recapture the brilliance of old or recognize that time has 
caught up with him. At 29, he already has said that this is his last World Cup, 
that he will not compete in the United States in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
But facing him in Turin's superb new stadium will be a nemesis: Brazil, the 
defending South American champion. It is a particularly daunting prospect for 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
In Spain in 1982, Argentina also had a crucial game in the second round. That 
was Maradona's first World Cup and it ended with him walking off the field in 
disgrace. Ejected from the match in Barcelona for committing a vicious foul, he 
seemed to many to be more prima donna than Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina's opponent that day was Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the teams meet again. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of person is it who knowingly breaks the rules of a sport, gets away 
with it and then boasts of the fact? 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City's Aztec Stadium four years ago, Maradona and Peter Shilton, 
England's goalkeeper, came face-to-face in an encounter that immediately became 
part of soccer lore. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the quarterfinals of the World Cup. Early in the second half 
of the scoreless match, both players leaped to reach a high ball in the penalty 
area. Shilton tried -- legally -- to punch it clear. Maradona tried -- 
illegally -- to punch it into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona succeeded and immediately raced toward the sideline celebrating his 
"goal." The linesmen and referee failed to see the infraction and let the goal 
stand despite protests by the English players. Argentina ended up winning, 2-1, 
and went on to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Replays clearly showed that Maradona had punched the ball into the net with his 
left fist, not with his head. But all Maradona would say at the time was that 
it was "the hand of God." 
</P>
<P>
The quote became famous, but also did something else: It reduced respect for 
Maradona among many fans around the world and, worse yet, it encouraged other 
players to cheat in similar fashion. After all, if it was good enough for 
Maradona . . . 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 World Cup was not supposed to produce any such incident. Referees had 
been forewarned by FIFA, soccer's world governing body, to be on the lookout 
for acts of deception. 
</P>
<P>
It was all the more astonishing, therefore, to see Maradona once again flaunt 
the rules of the sport. This time, he did so in what for the past five years 
has been his home stadium, San Paolo in Naples. He is regarded there as almost 
as a demigod by fans of Napoli, which he twice has led to the Italian League 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina was playing the Soviet Union in a game both teams had to win in order 
to maintain a realistic chance of advancing to the next round. The match was 
scoreless, but Nery Pumpido, the Argentine goalkeeper, had been carried off the 
field after suffering a broken leg in a clash with one of his own defenders. 
</P>
<P>
A header by the Soviet Union's Vladimir Kuznetsov flew in from the left. 
Maradona, standing inside the penalty area and in front of the net, raised his 
right arm. Cameras clicked and there on the front page of the next day's copies 
of La Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere Della Sera was Maradona once again 
illegally handling the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw the ball coming, my first reaction was to put my arm up," Maradona 
said afterward. "I didn't know if it would have been a goal and I was still 
upset about Pumpido. 
</P>
<P>
"Referees are like us, they make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, as in 1986, the match officials failed to see the infraction. Had 
they done so, the Soviets would have been awarded a penalty kick and it might 
be them, not the Argentines, who today would be playing in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
The latest hand ball prompted loud grumblings not only from Soviet Coach Valery 
Lobanovsky but also from the media. 
</P>
<P>
A cartoon the next day in London's Daily Mail showed a referee seated in front 
of an eye chart upon which letters of various sizes have been replaced by hands 
of varying size. "He's refereeing the next Argentina match," read the caption. 
</P>
<P>
"Diego Maradona would have made a splendid basketball player had he grown two 
feet taller," Jeff Powell wrote in the same newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Calvin, writing in the "Daily Telegraph," called Maradona's action "an 
affront," and said that his was "the unacceptable face of this World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
"He showed not the slightest bit of guilt that, once again, he had chipped away 
at sport's fundamental values," Calvin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, the Italian sports weekly Guerin Sportivo carried a color 
picture of the incident on its cover and referred to "the latest Maradona 
scandal." 
</P>
<P>
But Maradona once again escaped punishment. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, of course, is that Maradona is, in the truest sense of the word, a 
soccer-playing genius. When he is on his game, he is untouchable, the best 
player in the world. Just consider this description of one of Napoli's league 
matches against Juventus of Turin, a game in which Maradona scored twice: 
</P>
<P>
The playing surface, the writer said, was "a field of miracles . . . a coffer 
that is sometimes opened and Maradona all of a sudden takes out diamonds, 
rubies, sapphires, emeralds and topaz. With simple gestures and a marvelous 
movement of muscles, he has revived the enchantment. These two goals were the 
result of magic. Yesterday, the stadium was a crystal castle, people with fairy 
tale characters . . . (Maradona) left the field carrying his boots, like a 
violinist with his Stradivarius." 
</P>
<P>
Such flowery praise aside, there is little that Maradona has not achieved in 
the four years since winning the World Cup with Argentina in 1986. Nor is there 
a controversy he has avoided. Maradona's life, in fact, has been an ongoing 
soap opera, filled with one extraordinary incident after another. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the last four years, Maradona has: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Won two Italian League championships and one European title with Napoli 
despite a stormy relationship with the club that saw him report a month late 
for the start of the past season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Been the subject of an intense and bitter transfer debate when Olympic 
Marseilles of France tried to buy him from Napoli, which has him under contract 
until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Been accused of hitting a 15-year-old schoolboy who had followed him home. 
The charge was denied by Maradona and no more was heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Been threatened with a paternity suit, with the same outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Married his long-time girlfriend, Claudia Villafane, in a $1-million 
ceremony attended by Argentina's President, Carlos Menem. Maradona chartered a 
747 to fly his Napoli teammates and officials to the Buenos Aires bash last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Has been accused of consorting with leading figures in the Naples Mafia, 
the notorious Camorra, which derives much of its income from soccer betting. 
Maradona attended a wedding reception of one Camorra figure and, when asked 
about it, said: "I am an adult and I go where I want to. As I saw it, they were 
just a group of Napoli supporters. I didn't ask to see their calling cards." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Involved himself in the Olympic eligibility question by asking why, since 
Stefan Edberg could play in the Seoul Olympics, he couldn't play in the 
Barcelona Games of 1992. Soccer Olympic rules state only players under 23 may 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alleged that the World Cup draw was fixed to give Italy an easy group and 
Argentina a difficult one. This led to FIFA General Secretary Joseph Blatter 
calling Maradona "stupid and malicious" and threatening to ban him from the 
World Cup unless he recanted. In the end, Maradona paid a wrist-slap fine and 
all was forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Been voted athlete of the decade by the British sports media, beating out 
the likes of Carl Lewis, Edwin Moses and Seve Ballesteros. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Embroiled himself in a war of words with FIFA President Joao Havelange over 
how little of the World Cup's vast profits filtered down to the players taking 
part in the tournament. Considering the salary and benefits of players such as 
Maradona, Havelange was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (Maradona) isn't happy, he doesn't have to come (to the tournament)," 
Havelange said. "When Maradona arrived in Mexico, he was a normal person. 
Afterward, he was a star. So he has gained from playing in the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
But not from this one. So far, Maradona has contributed not even so much as a 
true shot on goal, although the value of his hand ball "save" against the 
Soviets is incalculable. 
</P>
<P>
Physically, he might have reached his limits. And the Argentine team itself is 
a pale shadow of four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Even Maradona realized after the loss to Cameroon -- and probably long before 
that -- that Argentina is not the same team it was in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is different and we should not hide the fact," he said. "The 
reality is that we are not at the same level as Italy, Brazil and West 
Germany." 
</P>
<P>
But there are still those who wonder. Is Maradona really through or has he been 
biding his time? Can he once again conjure up the magic of Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
Before the World Cup, former English Coach Ron Greenwood gave his opinion of 
the Argentine star. As matters turned out, it proved prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
"He is extravagantly gifted and able to do everything at pace," Greenwood said. 
"He has almost animal reflexes and awareness. He's one of the game's small and 
sadly diminishing band of genuine match winners." 
</P>
<P>
And that is exactly what concerns Brazil today. Maradona proved what he is 
capable of doing in Mexico. He has yet to do so in Italy, and today's match 
might be his last chance.

THE BEAUTY AND SORROW OF MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO'S MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN WEISMAN, Alan Weisman, whose work has often appeared in this magazine, 
is currently on extended assignment in Latin America.

<P>
AMONG THE WORKS of Mexican photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo is an image made 
in 1935 of a young woman seated in half shadow, wearing a dressing gown and 
striped shawl. Intruding through an unseen window is a prism of light, whose 
shape forms an uncanny, expanding echo of her profile. As she pulls back her 
long, shimmering hair, she stares into a pocket mirror. In it, she can see what 
she obviously already knows: that she is extraordinarily beautiful. Something 
else is also obvious. Her beauty terrifies her. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Alvarez Bravo, who will be honored with a major retrospective exhibition 
that opens July 12 at San Diego's Museum of Photographic Arts, is known for 
selecting titles as deliberately as he chooses his subject matter. If so, what 
ageless truth does he imply with this likeness, which he named "Portrait of the 
Eternal"? 
</P>
<P>
"The truth," suggests Mexican cinematographer Antonio Reynoso, Alvarez Bravo's 
friend and former student, "is that beauty is also terrible. It can paralyze 
the spirit. It can leave one breathless and immobile." He and Alvarez Bravo, he 
explains, live in a country that has been ravished repeatedly for its beauty, 
with waves of Spanish, French and North Americans usurping its gold, silver, 
land and spirit. "Don Manuel's photographs show that beauty and terror -- and, 
most of all, life and death -- are everlasting companions. Norteamericanos try 
to blind themselves to this reality." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego exhibition is intended to enlighten a North American audience 
largely unaware that, at age 88, Manuel Alvarez Bravo is considered one of the 
world's great photographic masters. Besides being acclaimed internationally for 
his wide-ranging body of work, he is regarded as the father of the thriving 
Mexican photography movement, which, according to the museum's director, Arthur 
Ollman, has produced some of the most original talent working in the medium 
today. Alvarez Bravo is, moreover, a living historical figure, a colleague and 
intimate of many of the century's most important artists, including muralists 
Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros; Rivera's wife, 
painter Frida Kahlo; surrealist Andre Breton, and photographers Edward Weston, 
Tina Modotti, Paul Strand and Henri Cartier-Bresson. 
</P>
<P>
Except for his friend Cartier-Bresson, living in Paris at age 82, Manuel 
Alvarez Bravo has survived them all. He resides in Coyoacan in southern Mexico 
City, a neighborhood of quiet cobbled streets and plazas shaded with laurels 
and ashes, where artists and poets drink espresso at outdoor cafes not far from 
the museum that was once the home of Kahlo and Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez Bravo is a thin man, with gray hair swept back from a lined face that 
seems to gather light. His voice is clear, complaining softly of how tired he 
is, then quickening with pleasure as he mentions colleagues whose lives have 
enriched his own. But anecdotes of who did what with whom no longer interest 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"There are books that tell about Tina, Diego, Clemente Orozco and Siqueiros," 
he says. "But what another person says about them is not important. What their 
work says, is." His own work provides a window into Mexican thought and 
perception, which Mexico's intellectuals and artists chronically insist are 
misunderstood in the United States. Unlike the forceful, monumental landscapes 
by the most celebrated modern photographer of the United States, Ansel Adams, 
Alvarez Bravo's photographic compositions are often subtle and mysterious. Rich 
with visual puns and ancient allusions, they lure a viewer into multiple levels 
of meaning and sensation. As literary laureate Octavio Paz writes in a poem 
that weaves an homage to Alvarez Bravo around several of his photographs' 
titles: 
</P>
<P>
. . . The eye thinks, 
</P>
<P>
the thought sees, 
</P>
<P>
the sight touches, 
</P>
<P>
the words burn. 
</P>
<P>
The differences between Adams and Alvarez Bravo reflect the contrast between 
their nations: one overwhelming the horizon with its blunt assertion of 
manifest destiny, the other always awaiting its mystical fate. Although Alvarez 
Bravo uses a camera, his vision derives from a land where, unlike the United 
States, technology has penetrated but never predominated. It is considered, 
rather, just another variant of a commonplace phenomenon in Mexican life: 
magic. 
</P>
<P>
MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO was born within a block of El Zocalo, Mexico City's vast 
central plaza. His family lived behind the Metropolitan Cathedral, northwest of 
the long, stone quadrangle of the National Palace. During his lifetime, the 
city has become the world's most populous; archeologists believe that when the 
conquistador Hernan Cortez arrived in 1519 -- when it was Tenochtitlan, the 
capital of the Aztec empire -- it also held that distinction. In 1902, the year 
of his birth, Alvarez Bravo's neighborhood comprised commercial streets and 
government offices, below which lay the ruins of an enormous temple. Like 
daydreams percolating up from the subconscious, the presence of this buried 
culture permeated the one superimposed above. 
</P>
<P>
With our practical sense of events having a firm chronological order, North 
Americans easily can grow perplexed in a country like Mexico, where time 
assumes liquid properties or evaporates altogether. Many Alvarez Bravo 
photographs blithely assume the coexistence of then and now, such as a portrait 
of a Mayan boy with a stone carving of what is evidently his face -- though the 
sculpture predates his birth by more than 1,000 years. Yet during Alvarez 
Bravo's early years, a leader who ruled like an ancient king had tried to 
cleave Mexico's past from its future and relegate its pre-Columbian heritage to 
mere memory. 
</P>
<P>
The country was in its third decade under the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz. 
Diaz had earned international adulation -- including Theodore Roosevelt's 
declaration that "among contemporary statesmen, there is none greater" -- for 
his determination to haul Mexico into the 20th Century. In a country left 
bankrupt and mired after a succession of wars, including one with the United 
States in which it lost half its territory, Diaz built factories, opened mines 
and connected Mexico's cities and frontiers with thousands of miles of railroad 
track. He financed his reforms with the cooperation of foreigners such as the 
Rockefellers, Hearsts and Guggenheims; they, in turn, received mineral, logging 
and ranching grants amounting to one-fifth of Mexico's territory. 
</P>
<P>
Of Mixtec Indian descent, Diaz increasingly regarded Mexico's native traditions 
as primitive and embarrassing. During his reign, thousands of Yaqui and Mayan 
Indians were enslaved and shipped to cotton, rice and hemp plantations. The 
dictator, meanwhile, was busy recasting Mexico City in what his patrician wife 
imagined to be the quintessential image of sophistication: Paris. He built a 
wide boulevard called the Paseo de la Reforma to replicate the Champs Elysees 
and raised an opulent, Parisian-style Palace of Fine Arts, to be filled with 
works emulating classic European aesthetic traditions. In a country studded 
with pyramids, he imported stone blocks from Europe for a lavish assemblage of 
new public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
One September morning when he was 8, Manuel Alvarez Bravo watched from the 
apartment of his godfather, a cashier in the Mexican treasury, as Diaz stood on 
the balcony of the Palacio Nacional and lorded regally over a massive 
demonstration. The dictator, resplendent in epaulets and plumed cap, was 
reviewing the largest celebration in Mexico's history, commemorating the 
centennial of its declaration of independence. It was, in fact, Diaz's final 
major public appearance; soon he would flee the country and the spreading 
nationwide peasant and Indian uprisings led by the likes of Pancho Villa and 
Emiliano Zapata. Alvarez Bravo's school days henceforth were punctuated by 
recurrent cannon and artillery blasts outside his classrooms, as Mexico 
collapsed into savage, chaotic revolution. In the afternoon, he would return 
home under skies filled with vultures circling the corpses of soldiers lying in 
his path. 
</P>
<P>
"We would find cartridges scattered on the ground. Chapultepec Park was filled 
with soldiers guarding the president's home. They sat on the grass, playing 
strange, sad melodies on their harmonicas. All these things," he says, "survive 
in the unconscious. They were dramatic events, but they also blended with daily 
life." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the fighting subsided, he was nearly 20. The daily events during 
his formative years included the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans. 
Over the centuries, life in Mexico had encompassed Aztec ritual human sacrifice 
and an even bloodier transition to Christianity. Following that, millions of 
Indians succumbed to smallpox, measles and other plagues imported from Europe. 
When, in 1822, Mexican independence finally halted 300 years of colonialism, 
none of its heroes escaped execution during the brutal aftermath. Civil wars, 
raging poverty, violent repression and now devastating revolution had conspired 
to keep one age-old Mexican ritual alive, re-enacted annually in its 
cemeteries. Each Nov. 2, the Day of the Dead, Mexicans flout death's audacity 
at trying to separate them from their loved ones by partying with the deceased, 
picnicking on their graves while children exchange candy skulls decorated like 
valentines with each others' names. 
</P>
<P>
"Toy skeletons and sugary little skulls," Alvarez Bravo likes to note, "are our 
most renowned popular art." In 1934 he would make his most famous photograph, 
one that epitomizes this mingled essence of sweetness and sorrow. Taken during 
a labor strike, it shows a protesting factory worker moments after he is 
murdered. His face and hair are drenched in fresh, flowing blood, but the 
photographer somehow managed to avoid making a mere political document. Shot at 
a close, almost intimate, perspective, the result depicts not gore but release, 
even serenity. A glint in the supine victim's eye suggests that death does not 
extinguish life, but furthers it. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan Perez, director of photography at Jerusalem's Israel Museum and 
co-curator of the San Diego retrospective, has written that Alvarez Bravo often 
exhibits this image alongside one taken a year earlier titled "Public Thirst." 
In it, a barefoot boy drinks at an outdoor fountain, a felicitous sunbeam 
crowning his hair with a halo. The title relates his poverty to the thirst of 
Mexico's gods that has always been slaked by popular sacrifice; the striker's 
impassioned death belongs to this tradition. Bloodshed repeatedly has nurtured 
growth and renewal in Mexico, and in no time did that prove truer than during 
the 1920s and 1930s after the revolution, a golden age that produced an 
astonishing outpouring of art and genius. 
</P>
<P>
So many teachers had left Alvarez Bravo's primary school to fight that by age 
13 he was gone himself, working as a copy clerk. For the next few years, he 
tried various careers, studying accounting, music, painting and homeopathy, all 
without marked success. During that time, the father of one of his friends 
would sometimes bring home cameras from the Monte de Piedad, Mexico's national 
pawnshop, which functions as bank for the poor. Alvarez Bravo was interested: 
Photography, he decided with relief, was something he could teach himself. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 21, he met Hugo Brehme, a photographer from Dresden who had 
traveled from Panama to Yucatan on a magazine assignment, then decided he liked 
Mexico and stayed. Brehme led him to another expatriate photographer, Wilhelm 
Kahlo, whose daughter Frida would one day sit for one of Alvarez Bravo's finest 
portraits. Brehme and Kahlo, both Germans, were not alone in Mexico. As the 
first major people's revolt of the century, the revolution had focused 
worldwide attention on the country. Writers Ambrose Bierce and D. H. Lawrence, 
filmmakers Sergei Eisenstein and Paul Strand and photographers Edward Weston 
and Tina Modotti were other American and European artists to whom 20th-Century 
Mexico's mystique, as well as its extraordinary quality of light, proved 
irresistible. To poet Andre Breton, the place virtually embodied surrealism. 
Their presence in the country reversed the traditional pilgrimage of Mexican 
artists to the Continent and to the United States, and in the years that 
Alvarez Bravo was Brehme's assistant, Mexico's own also were returning. 
</P>
<P>
Diego Rivera had spent the war in Europe; now he left Cubism and joined Orozco 
and Alfaro Siqueiros in adorning Mexico's public buildings. Their murals were a 
reaction against effete paintings confined to exclusive galleries; their 
subjects -- the Indians, laborers and peasants who had reasserted claim to 
their homeland -- were the antithesis of the old aristocratic values. 
</P>
<P>
At 23, a lean young man with a mustache, his hair worn back and slightly long, 
Alvarez Bravo married his childhood sweetheart, Lola Martinez. As photography 
was not yet a paying alternative, he accepted a job in Oaxaca with the Treasury 
Department. He stayed for two years, during which he entered a regional 
photography contest, submitting a scene from Chapultepec Park. It was a safe 
image, respecting the norms of Brehme's pictorial style: a rowboat on the lake, 
carefully framed by tree branches in the foreground. It won first prize. 
</P>
<P>
Thus encouraged, when he and Lola returned to the capital in 1927, he immersed 
himself in the exhilaration swirling through the cafes around the San Carlos 
National Academy of Fine Arts near the Zocalo. During his absence, the American 
photographer Edward Weston had been living and working in Mexico City with his 
lover, the Italian actress Tina Modotti, herself a gifted photographer. Weston 
had returned to the States, but Modotti remained behind to photograph murals 
for Rivera, Orozco and Alfaro Siqueiros. Alvarez Bravo had seen the famous 
couple together previously and had been studying their images in magazines. Now 
he arranged to meet Modotti and show her his work. 
</P>
<P>
One Weston still life, of a toilet, had been considered so disgraceful in 
Mexico that the magazine that printed it was forced to cease publication. Among 
the images that Modotti insisted that Alvarez Bravo send to Weston in 
California was one of a torso of a boy urinating into a porcelain bowl. He did 
so, with no explanation attached. An impressed Weston, having never heard of 
"M. Alvarez Bravo," suspected that Tina had actually taken the pictures. He 
wrote back: 
</P>
<P>
"I am wondering why I have been the recipient of a very fine series of 
photographs from you? . . . I must tell you how much I am enjoying them. 
Sincerely, they are important, and if you are a new worker, photography is 
fortunate in having someone with your viewpoint. . . . Perhaps the finest, for 
me, is the child urinating: finely seen and executed." 
</P>
<P>
Modotti introduced Alvarez Bravo to magazine editors and to Diego Rivera. Like 
many artists in the late '20s, both she and Rivera were members of the 
Communist Party, which in Mexico chiefly distinguished itself with ceaseless 
factionalism among its members. Rivera eventually was expelled for accepting 
bourgeois money to paint murals on government buildings, regardless of how many 
hammers and sickles he prominently featured. At one point, he personally 
escorted Leon Trotsky to Mexico City; Trotsky stayed with him and Frida Kahlo 
until an argument ended their friendship. Modotti, whose nude images 
scandalized conservative Mexicans, was implicated twice by the right-wing press 
as a murder suspect: first in the death of a Cuban party comrade, and second in 
an attempt on Mexican President Pascual Ortiz Rubio. For the latter charge, she 
was expelled from the country. Alvarez Bravo took her to the train depot. As 
she left Mexico City, she handed him her 8"-by-10" view camera. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez Bravo took her place as photographer to the muralists, a demanding 
opportunity that helped perfect his sense of visual composition. Unlike the 
flamboyant Rivera and the inflamed Alfaro Siqueiros, who was jailed frequently 
for his militant socialism, he was reserved, known as a meticulous worker and a 
listener. Although Alvarez Bravo joined the left-wing Revolutionary League of 
Writers and Artists, it was apparent that his passions lay in aesthetics, not 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera encouraged him to find images in Mexico's pueblos and sierras. What 
resulted was neither sentimentally picturesque nor folkloric, but an evocation 
of the unremarkable moments that add up to Mexico's remarkable essence. Nothing 
like what he produced had ever been seen before: "Like a ray of light 
penetrating a darkened room, revealing the particles suspended in the air," 
wrote Rivera. Through his lens, a dead tree in a field became a moaning 
apparition; a shadow formed a fantasy landscape; a brick kiln transmuted into 
an ancient city of burning pyramids and tombs. 
</P>
<P>
When Rivera became the San Carlos Academy's director, Alvarez Bravo joined the 
faculty. Backpacking his tripod and view camera, he would take students to the 
high plains of Lake Texcoco, the watery surroundings of the Aztec island empire 
until Diaz contracted the British to drain it. On such an arid steppe, Mexican 
novelist Juan Rulfo set his masterpiece "Pedro Paramo," which portrayed a 
village where both protagonist and readers could barely tell the living from 
the dead -- they themselves didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
Here, Alvarez Bravo produced pictures such as one innocently titled "A Horse 
for Riding on Sundays." In it, a rider gallops through a barren landscape past 
a huddled peasant family he never notices. It is Alvarez Bravo's only known 
photo of a live horse -- but strange, sometimes sinister, wooden or toy equines 
appear so often in his work that today nearly every aspiring Mexican 
photographer eventually aims his camera at one. Is this an intentional, 
symbolic reference to the mounts ridden by the conquistadors, who tricked the 
Indians into believing they were centaurlike gods? 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Alvarez Bravo sidesteps interpretations of his images, suggesting 
that people ask his photographs, not him, what they mean. "Shoot what you see, 
not what you think. A photographer's philosophy should be not to have one," 
he'd reply when students would try to probe his creative processes. In 1939, 
when Breton invited him to take part in a surrealist exhibition, he obligingly 
concocted an appropriately strange scenario: a nude model, her feet and loins 
partially wrapped in bandages, lying on a blanket surrounded by spiny cactus 
buds. Intended to be a spoof, the result -- cryptically titled "Good Reputation 
Sleeping" -- was so arresting that it became one of his most intensely analyzed 
photographs. Alvarez Bravo confesses that all the intrigue surrounding the 
picture led him to wonder himself what had inspired it. After identifying 
elements ranging from ballet rehearsals he'd witnessed to boyhood readings of 
Rousseau, he concluded: "You bring your accumulated life to the moment that 
something sparks you to make an image. Everything influences you. And it's all 
good." 
</P>
<P>
HECTOR GARCIA was a student at Mexico's National Polytechnic Institute in the 
early 1940s when he joined the emergency Mexican labor force that headed north 
to keep the United States functioning during World War II. One night in New 
York, while uncovering railroad tracks buried by a blizzard, an unscheduled 
military train hurtled through. The workers pressed themselves against the 
sides of the icy tunnel they'd excavated, but after it passed, the snow 
appeared to be covered with bright red poppies. Garcia, who carried a Brownie 
camera in his lunch pail, made several shots to record the wartime martyrdom of 
a Mexican bracero. His images, however, turned out blank -- he had not known 
how to compensate for the snow's reflection. 
</P>
<P>
The incident convinced him he should study photography. Back in Mexico City, he 
did so under Alvarez Bravo; eventually, Garcia became Mexico's most esteemed 
photojournalist, his work appearing in newspapers worldwide and in Time-Life 
publications. What he learned from Alvarez Bravo was not so much technique as 
attitude. "Don Manuel is that perfect Mexican mixture of two worlds, knowing 
what a European knows about art, and feeling what an Indian feels about land." 
</P>
<P>
"Until Alvarez Bravo, we had the formal portraits of the 19th Century and the 
photojournalism of the revolution," adds Pablo Ortiz Monasterio, editor of a 
distinguished Mexican series of photography books titled "Coleccion Rio de Luz" 
-- "The River of Light Collection." "With Don Manuel, Mexican photography as an 
expressive art became possible." 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz Monasterio belongs to the latest generation of Mexican fine-arts 
photographers who acknowledge their debt to Alvarez Bravo. Currently, the most 
renowned among his colleagues is Graciela Iturbide. In 1972, she was a 
30-year-old wife and mother who had resumed her education, taking film classes 
at the University of Mexico when she realized that Alvarez Bravo was teaching 
photography across the hall. One day she timidly approached him. To her 
surprise, he invited her to be his assistant. The principal message of his 
tutelage was summarized by a sign in his spotless darkroom. 
</P>
<P>
It read: "Hay tiempo" -- there is time. "Don't hurry," he kept telling her. 
Instead of discussing chemistry or optics, he made her read poetry, study 
Picasso, listen to Bach and Verdi, and travel to the countryside and villages. 
A city dweller all her life, those places became her subjects. Iturbide since 
has been honored with some of the most prestigious photography awards of 
Europe, the United States and Latin America; like her mentor's, Iturbide's 
works are exhibited around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Alvarez Bravo's home, bright magenta bougainvillea cascades over the 
garden walls; within its carved doors, a brick ceiling supported by vigas 
arches over a stone floor covered with woven mats. The rooms are lined with 
paintings and photographs, the shelves filled with books and stone antiquities. 
In a turbulent place and era, his life has been relatively placid and remains 
so today. His marriage to Lola, a noted photographer in her own right, gave way 
to a second, to American anthropologist Doris Heydn, who in turn was followed 
by his present wife, French photographer Colette Alvarez Urbajtel. But he has 
been a private man, and his liaisons never became the stuff of legendary 
gossip. Instead, his emotions have always been best divined through his 
painstaking selection of the timeless moments that infuse his work. His most 
unforgettable images illuminate those spaces between dramatic events where life 
truly occurs: a girl suspended in daydream, or cyclists in perfect cadence with 
the visual rhythm of mountains rising around them. 
</P>
<P>
He still labors in his darkroom, assisted by Colette, but at 88 he has forsaken 
traipsing through the landscape for the less taxing, agreeable business of 
mainly photographing female nudes. 
</P>
<P>
"The nude, like death, is a constant," he explains. "It represents life. Life 
and death have intertwined in Mexico's mind since the pre-Hispanic goddess 
Coatlicue, whose breasts give sustenance and whose belt of serpents brings 
doom. She embodies the duality that always accompanies us." 
</P>
<P>
She is among the ancient deities who haunt his images, their names invading his 
titles. Sometimes he has photographed their original stone representations, and 
sometimes he has reincarnated them via his human subjects. In Manuel Alvarez 
Bravo's Mexico, a tradition of artists who interpret the gods to the public 
descends through ornate temple carvings and huge murals to the photographic 
exhibitions so popular in Mexico today. 
</P>
<P>
Few Mexicans can afford to purchase original prints, and making them often 
requires much sacrifice to acquire precious sheets of imported, silver-emulsion 
photo paper. Even though an entire room in Mexico City's Museum of Modern Art 
is dedicated to Alvarez Bravo, the biggest market for his work still exists 
outside the country. But what he began in this intensely visual land, using a 
camera not merely to document beauty but to create it, is now being repeated by 
generations of disciples. No illusions of riches inspire them, only mythic 
surroundings -- surroundings where, as Don Manuel once put it, "I became a 
photographer in search of my own original image." 
</P>
<P>

photographs, will be on display from July 12 through Sept. 9 at the Museum of

'TRUE BELIEVER' ATTORNEY TONY SERRA FIGHTS HIS OWN VERSION OF THE INDIAN WARS 
-- IN A COURTROOM

THIS IS THE prosecution's story: Shortly before midnight on July 16, 1978, a 
band of young Indians, riding high from a weekend of weed, whiskey and late 
nights, looted the Sports and Spirits liquor store in Yreka, Calif., a lumber 
town near the Oregon border, jumped in their getaway car and sped north, chased 
by the screaming sirens of the Yreka police department. As the carload of 
Indians raced down Route 263 in their aging Pontiac sedan, one of them, Darrell 
Jones, leaned out of the window and took a shot at the pursuing lawmen. The 
driver of the Pontiac, Jones' 23-year-old cousin, Patrick "Hooty" Croy, then 
took a sharp left up a deeply rutted dirt road known as Rocky Gulch and headed 
for his grandmother's house, an old miner's cabin in the foothills of Badger 
Mountain. When they got there, three of them -- Croy, his sister Norma Jean and 
Jones -- jumped out of the car and ran up a chaparral-covered ridge; from that 
vantage point they rained bullets down on the growing posse of Yreka police 
officers, Siskyou County sheriffs and California Highway Patrol officers below. 
During a lull in this hail of metal, Hooty Croy stripped off his shirt and 
shoes and, like a half-naked Indian warrior of old, made his way stealthily 
around the moonlit ridge, his .22-caliber lever-action magnum rifle in hand, 
and crept to the rear of the cabin, where he knew he could find extra 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
There he ambushed 27-year-old Yreka lawman Jesse Joe "Bo" Hittson, shooting him 
fatally through the heart. Croy himself was then wounded twice, once in the 
back of his right arm and once in the right buttock, before he finally gave 
himself up to the men with badges. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night of stoned-out violence, of whooping Indians on the warpath, 
according to the official version. Croy and his band had swilled and smoked 
that night, that entire weekend, until they had blood in the eye, said the 
prosecutors. And when the first light shimmered off Mount Shasta, the 
snow-capped peak that local Indians consider a shrine, one good, young, 
civic-minded cop was dead. The following year, a jury concurred with this 
version of events. Hooty Croy was convicted of first-degree murder and 
sentenced to death, and his four companions were found guilty of lesser degrees 
of homicide. Croy was sent to San Quentin's Death Row, where he assumed his 
position in the executioner's holding pattern, not far behind his neighbor and 
friend Robert Alton Harris. 
</P>
<P>
FOR MORE THAN a decade, the official version of the shoot-out at Rocky Gulch 
remained the version, a story as solid and undisturbed as Bo Hittson's marble 
tombstone on the hillside of Yreka's Evergreen Cemetery. But on November 30, 
1989, the legendary defense attorney J. Tony Serra, the longhaired courtroom 
orator who inspired the 1988 movie "True Believer," starring James Woods, rose 
to his feet in Department 28 of San Francisco Superior Court and in 
spellbinding fashion delivered a very different account of that bloody summer 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom was stuffed with spectators that morning, including actor Gene 
Hackman, a medicine man wearing a ceremonial necklace and a pouch filled with 
feathers, and young, horn-rimmed attorneys literally kneeling in the aisles to 
watch the master of the opening argument at work. It was, in short, a typically 
charged courtroom premiere for the ever-dramatic Tony Serra. The stage had been 
set for this compelling sequel to the Hooty Croy case on Rose Bird's final day 
in office, when the state Supreme Court overturned Croy's 1979 murder 
conviction and opened the way for a new trial. This time, the Karuk-Shasta 
Indian would not be represented by a small-town lawyer, a former prosecutor 
Croy could not bring himself to trust, but by a silver-tongued crusader. 
</P>
<P>
The law, as practiced by Tony Serra, is not a cold and technical forensic 
procedure but a passion play surging with grand sentiments and principles. 
"They want to cry in the jury box," he says. "They want to be outraged." 
</P>
<P>
This is how Serra takes the jury back to Rocky Gulch; this is the ballad of 
Hooty Croy as sung by his operatic attorney: The story begins not in the Sports 
and Spirits store in the summer of 1978, but back in the Gold Rush days, when 
thousands of frenzied miners swept into the valleys of northwest California, 
killing and enslaving the Indians who stood in the way of their claims. It is a 
horrible story he recounts, one still not widely known in the state -- a story 
of vigilante groups marching out from Yreka and other mining towns, flying 
banners that clearly announced their purpose: exterminate; of local governments 
paying 50-cent bounties for Indian scalps and heads; of Indian boys and girls 
being kidnapped and sold to miners as sexual slaves and beasts of burden; of 
Indian babies whose brains were dashed out against tree trunks. "The Indian was 
an impediment to the white man's Manifest Destiny," Serra tells the jury. "Get 
rid of him, like the coyote." 
</P>
<P>
The bad blood still flows between whites and Indians in Yreka, Serra says. And 
it flowed that night in Rocky Gulch. There was no robbery at the Sports and 
Spirits store, Serra argues, only an altercation with a white clerk who had it 
in for Hooty Croy, maybe for all Indians. Croy and the others had stopped by to 
pick up a couple of six packs of beer before going night-hunting for deer, a 
common practice among local Indians. But minutes later, they were being chased 
by white lawmen. And after Darrell Jones took his one wild shot out the back 
window, says Serra, the cry of these lawmen was the same as the Gold Rush 
vigilantes' -- exterminate. 
</P>
<P>
"The radio alert goes out to this effect: 'Drunk Indians are shooting at us! 
Come on, boys, let's get them! This is our opportunity. Kill them, kill them!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Serra is humming with the full power of history. He's acting out all the parts, 
his arms go flying, his voice soars and plummets like a siren. His energy 
threatens to burst the seams of his trademark thrift-store suit that is, like 
all of his courtroom outfits, one full size too small for him. The snug-fitting 
suits make him look bigger than he is, and he is a big man, a former Stanford 
wide receiver. He flirts with clownishness with his floodwater pants, his 
flowing gray hair and his too-big gestures. But there is character in his 
Mediterranean face -- the high brow, the dark, flashing eyes, the Roman nose -- 
and a sense of theatrical majesty about him. All eyes in the courtroom are 
riveted on him. 
</P>
<P>
Now Serra is back inside the Indians' minds that night. Hooty guns the Pontiac 
toward his grandmother's cabin. "Because in a certain animal panic, that's 
where you run," Serra explains to the jury, his voice rising once more. "To 
grandmother's house." This is where Croy had spent much of his childhood, 
working in his grandmother's garden, packing water from the well, hunting 
rabbits and deer. His grandmother would tell Hooty about the tragedies that 
befell the Shastas and the Karuks, about the Humbug massacres that happened not 
far from her cabin, when the rivers and creeks ran red with blood. Hooty would 
sleep during the day and wander these hills at night like an owl, which is how 
he got his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
And it is into these same hills that he and his sister Norma Jean and cousin 
Darrell now run to escape the posse. 
</P>
<P>
Serra wants the jury to feel the cold-sweat panic of their flight. "They're 
running up the hill, out jump the officers -- bam, bam, bam. . . . There is 
complete chaos in the quarters of the police, no chain of command, just 
unbridled, random destruction -- a mob scene. All of them shooting, shooting at 
anything that moved. AR-15s, handguns, shotguns, M-16s, semiautomatic weapons." 
Norma Jean is shot in the back. Darrell is shot in the groin. "They were like 
animals under fire!" Serra shouts. "In their minds they knew they were going to 
die. Because what was in their minds was the history of relations with the 
white settlers, the genocide, 95% of the Indians wiped out in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Hooty thinks his sister is dead, he thinks there is no surrendering that night. 
He thinks that the posse in its blazing fury is shooting up the cabin with his 
beloved grandmother and elderly aunt inside it. He retrieves the hunting rifle 
that Darrell has thrown away -- the only weapon in the Indians' possession. He 
strips off his T-shirt and shoes. He will become an Indian brave, he will 
rescue his elders from the cabin and take them to safety. 
</P>
<P>
Hooty makes his way around the ridge, crouching low and sprinting from one 
clump of brush to the next to avoid the police spotlights. He reaches the rear 
of the cabin and is preparing to crawl through the window when Bo Hittson, 
called to duty after an idyllic Sunday of water-skiing, barbecuing and beer 
drinking, surprises him from behind. Hittson fires his .357 magnum twice, and 
the wounded Indian spins around and fires the one deadly shot that has brought 
everyone to this San Francisco courtroom today. 
</P>
<P>
Here is how Serra wants the jury to understand this fatal exchange: "A white 
police officer shot an Indian; a white police officer shot an Indian twice; a 
white police officer shot an Indian twice in the back." With each repetition, 
Serra's voice swells to a higher decibel level. "A white police officer shot an 
Indian twice in the back during a de facto cease-fire while he was under the 
influence of alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Hooty Croy returned the fire, but Serra urges the jury to consider this 
point of law. "Citizens, ordinary citizens, can defend themselves against 
police officers if the police officers use unreasonable or excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
It's a captivating performance. "He's really something, isn't he?" says Gene 
Hackman afterward. Like James Woods before him, Hackman has come to the 
courtroom seeking inspiration for his role as a socially committed attorney in 
the upcoming film "Class Action" and because he feels "some sympathy with this 
case. You know," he adds, "Jimmy's a great actor, but actors always suffer in 
comparison to the real thing. They're never quite as dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
SERRA HAS CONJURED the night at Rocky Gulch in this courtroom many years and 
many miles away by crawling inside the lawmen's and Indians' skins and acting 
out their roles, complete with sound effects -- bam, bam, bam! He also has 
elevated the shoot-out to epic proportions by invoking those tragic days of 
blood and gold from Northern California's past. The courtroom becomes a grander 
stage when Tony Serra struts its boards, spacious enough to accommodate 
history, poetry and the dramatic arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in the romance of law," Serra says. "There has always been an 
impassioned verbal tradition that has flowed through the judiciary in this 
country. It came into full flower during the '60s. But now, once again lawyers 
are mainly agents of business, pragmatists who assess damages and injuries. If 
you speak out boldly, if you emote, if you call upon jurors to apply morality 
and ethics, if you call upon jurors to listen to the words of great poets and 
prophets -- if you do all that instead of limiting yourself to the dry, 
technical linguistics of the law, then suddenly you're a throwback or some kind 
of eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
"But that is the true calling of the lawyer, to argue passionately in defense 
of our freedoms. That's basically their metaphysical appointment within our 
culture. Not to make more money for wealthy people. I mean, get rid of lawyers 
if that's all they're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
This impassioned style of law works best, of course, when a defense attorney 
has a hero, a noble underdog, around whom to wrap the courtroom drama. "If Tony 
can inject a cause into a case, he's among the very best," says Tom Orloff, the 
chief assistant district attorney for Alameda County, who found this out in 
1979, when Serra thwarted his effort to convict Black Panther leader Huey 
Newton of murdering a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
When the Hooty Croy case was brought to Serra's attention by a paralegal who 
had worked with him on the Chol Soo Lee trial in 1982, the murder case 
dramatized in "True Believer," Serra felt he had been handed the greatest cause 
of his career. "It's a case that every defense lawyer waits a lifetime to get. 
Because very seldom do you get a case, let alone a death-penalty case, with 
such socially significant issues, and where your client, from any perspective, 
is innocent. So you feel honored, you feel graced, you feel like your karma is 
good -- that you got chosen for such a case. What a wonderful thing!" 
</P>
<P>
Serra would invest himself totally in the mammoth Croy trial, as it stretched 
from the summer of 1989 to this spring. There was no money in it for him, says 
Serra -- he waived his fee. To hear him tell it, the Croy case, with its power 
to illuminate more than a century of Anglo-Saxon violence toward the Indian 
population of Northern California, was its own reward. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for the true believers of today's legal profession is that there 
seem to be fewer and fewer heroic defendants in whom to believe. "In the '60s, 
there were lots of cause cases, and I tried to identify with as many as I 
could," Serra says. "The Croy case is reminiscent of that era, but it stands 
kind of lonely and isolated in a frigid panorama." 
</P>
<P>
Some would say that there were not that many genuine heroes even back then. The 
three cases from those turbulent times that Serra points to with the most pride 
are those of Newton, "the Supreme Servant of the People," who had already begun 
his descent into drugs and thuggery ("A true leader of his people," Serra still 
insists on calling him, "wise and charismatic"); Russell Little, a soldier in 
the Symbionese Liberation Army, one of the wackiest shock troops of the period, 
who stood accused of assassinating Oakland school superintendent Marcus Foster, 
and Jacques Rogiers, the eccentric pamphleteer for a secret cell of mad bombers 
that called itself the New World Liberation Front ("a rare and beautiful 
person," according to Serra). 
</P>
<P>
Despite Serra's lofty claims on their behalf, it is hard to put these political 
defendants in the same moral league as, say, Martin Luther King Jr., the 
Berrigan brothers or Dave Dellinger. In some lawyers, this faith in 
long-discredited clients would seem like pure cynicism. In Serra, it seems like 
pure romanticism. He is an exasperating and charming man. 
</P>
<P>
If it was difficult to locate epic heroes in the 1960s and '70s, it seems nigh 
impossible today. So, for the most part, Serra employs his brilliant oratorical 
skills, his bright palette of emotions, on behalf of run-of-the-mill drug 
dealers and murderers. But even there, he tries to select only cases where he 
can dig out some larger principle -- a violation of constitutional rights, a 
saber-twist of prosecutorial villainy -- to justify his knightly style of 
lawyering. "I try to find a platform where I can make a stand, allege 
corruption or perjury or some kind of foul play that the government has 
participated in," Serra says. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't always work. In 1987, Serra went to battle in Oakland Superior Court 
on behalf of one Peter McFetridge, a Berkeley cafe philosopher who stood 
accused of murdering his girlfriend, Morey Cunningham. "I think what appealed 
to Tony about it was that there was no body," says Alameda County Deputy 
District Attorney Jon Goodfellow, who prosecuted the case. But midway through 
the trial, Serra's "no body, no crime" defense was dealt a fatal blow when his 
client blurted out on the witness stand that he had indeed killed Cunningham 
and buried her body under the porch of their house. Serra quickly shifted to a 
self-defense strategy, but that, too, proved full of holes when the murder 
victim's body was dug up and found to have been shot at least four times -- 
once in the eye, once in the neck and twice in the head. McFetridge was 
convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 17 years to life.

<P>
"It just wasn't Tony's kind of case," says Goodfellow. "It wasn't about abuse 
of power or social injustice. It was a man, a woman and a gun, and he couldn't 
do much with that. He tried to go after me and the police, but it fell flat." 
</P>
<P>
Serra, who has a high win rate, is much more effective in his defense of drug 
cases -- and his heart is undoubtedly more in them as well. In "True Believer," 
he is portrayed as something of a burnout, cynically making money off drug 
clients until a young law-school graduate helps reinvigorate his '60s idealism. 
This is a decidedly false interpretation of Serra. In Serra's mind, there is no 
shame or hypocrisy attached to his drug practice; on the contrary, he is proud 
of it. Tony Serra is as much a true believer in drugs and their salutary powers 
as he is in minority rights. 
</P>
<P>
He comes loping out of his office at the end of a long and taxing day to greet 
this reporter, trailing a rich and billowing cloud of bittersweet herb. The 
office of Serra, Perelson, Anton, Lichter and Daar, floating above a row of 
antique shops on San Francisco's Jackson Street, looks more like a Deadhead's 
dream house than what it is, the suite of a high-powered law firm. The rooms 
are cluttered with vintage furniture with sagging seats, a totem pole, a cage 
with a singing parakeet, hookahs, a cow skull, dried animal skins with Indian 
designs and other ceremonial wall hangings. Yes, Serra admits, he enjoys 
smoking a pipe full of hashish or marijuana in his off hours. And in his 
youthful past, he experimented with opium, cocaine and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"All drugs have their value," he contends. "Man has always pursued some higher 
form of self-knowledge or wisdom, and every one of those drugs gives you that 
in some way. What the hell, the history of art and literature -- Western and 
Eastern -- has been filled with opiated consciousness. So there's no way I'm 
going to say that drugs are self-destructive and annihilating. It's all a life 
force." 
</P>
<P>
And what of the overdoses in trashed-out urban shooting galleries and the 
brain-jangled infants born to crack addicts? Where is the life force there? 
"Well, in any transition to another form of consciousness, there has to be the 
expendable," Serra replies. "And that's what drugs are -- the collective 
unconscious reaching for another spiritual or aesthetic plateau. If, in that 
process, 5% die or self-destruct, that's small, that's small. The whole human 
race may become expendable if we don't continue exploring different realms of 
consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Serra believes that American society is now in the grip of a drug-control 
hysteria because an "executive class" of politicians, military brass and law 
enforcement officials is playing on the population's fears in order to expand 
its power. 
</P>
<P>
So he flies all over the country, including the Bible Belt (where his long gray 
hair and his ragtag suits make people think he is a circuit preacher), and all 
over the world to help free drug dealers who have been caught in wily 
government snares. "That crazy California lawyer" has a reputation for winning 
unwinnable cases because "as someone coming out of the '60s, I can bring a 
certain vigor to entrapment cases. I can do entrapment defenses with 
self-righteous dignity, and jurors will buy it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is hard to work up a great deal of outrage and sympathy on behalf of 
Serra's more prosperous drug clients. Among those he has sprung in recent years 
are Hells Angels gang leaders and a Lebanese drug lord from a wealthy Falangist 
family. Serra is eloquent in his disdain for lawyers who make a practice of 
fronting for Big Money, but the drug business is now Big Business, and Serra 
has become its hired gun. "In the past, you could get excited about defending a 
flower child against going to prison for a bag of marijuana," James Lassart, 
the former head of the federal government's Drug Enforcement Task Force, once 
told a reporter. Lassart has faced Serra many times in court. "Now it's the guy 
with triple gold chains, driving a BMW and moving drugs offshore." 
</P>
<P>
While his clients grow richer and flashier, Serra maintains the same humble 
lifestyle he adopted during the Age of Aquarius. The tales of conspicuous 
underconsumption have become part of the Tony Serra legend. He lives in a 
cheap, sparsely furnished North Beach apartment with his lover, Vicky Ervin, 
who works as an accountant while she pursues a teaching degree at San Francisco 
State University. Over the years, he has rattled around town in a series of 
junkers (none of which has cost him more than $500), abandoning them on the 
street after they collect thousands of dollars in unpaid parking fines. He 
spent four months in federal prison in 1975 for failing to file income tax 
returns for 17 years running, and he was suspended from practicing law for 30 
days in 1988 after pleading guilty to the misdemeanor charge of filing his 1978 
return years late. One day during the Hooty Croy trial, a bill collector 
marched into the courtroom and tried to have Serra arrested for an old debt. "I 
said, 'Sorry man, I can't go anywhere, I'm in the middle of a murder trial 
here,' " he laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Like Serra's courtroom attire, his leisure wardrobe is more Goodwill than GQ, 
T-shirts and jeans that have been baptized too often at the local Laundromat. 
Serra's only obvious bit of vanity is his refusal to reveal his age, which is 
50-something. 
</P>
<P>
His recreational tastes are equally simple. He enjoys walking on the beach or 
taking bicycle trips with his kids -- 17-year-old twin sons Shelter and Ivory, 
15-year-old son Chime Day, daughters Wonder Fortune, 13, and Lilac Bright, 10 
-- who live with their mother, Mary Edna Dineen, in Bolinas. And he likes to 
get high and go dancing at rock shows. "The Dead are still my favorite. I'm an 
old dance freak -- I move in that kind of elongated, psychedelic way," says 
Serra, waving his hands in the air as if he has just picked up the opening 
chords of "Truckin' " on his frequency. "Now it's archaic; my kids make fun of 
me. They're into this hard-rhythm sound." 
</P>
<P>
Acquisitiveness has never seemed to be part of Tony Serra's nature. He comes 
from a modest background: His father, who emigrated to San Francisco from 
Mallorca as a boy, worked in a jellybean factory. His Russian-Jewish mother 
taught Tony and his two brothers to value the aesthetic over the material. 
"From one perspective, she was crazy; from another, she was brilliant. She was 
a screamer; she was brooding. She was into poetry and art. On your birthday, 
she would give you a colorful piece of cloth." She killed herself in her 70s, 
walking straight into the waves off a city beach where she had taken her sons 
as boys, where she had screamed to them, "Come back, come back, you're out too 
far!" 
</P>
<P>
Serra sees himself as a combination of his mother's eccentricity and his 
father's stability. In the courtroom, he has the soul of an artist, with his 
broad and vivid strokes, and the steely mental edge of a logician. It's a 
unique style that wins the hearts of juries and the respect of his colleagues, 
including prosecutors. "There is really no one like him," says district 
attorney Orloff. "He's a master of the dramatic -- he uses his voice like a 
musical instrument. People like to hear him speak. People like him, period. He 
has a great deal of boyish charm, even as he gets older." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just theatrics," says Frank Fernandez, a San Francisco deputy public 
defender, who popped in as often as he could to watch Serra's performance in 
the Croy trial. "He's extremely well prepared and quick on his feet. He can 
catch a witness in a contradiction before the words are all out of the person's 
mouth. I come to just watch and learn." 
</P>
<P>
Heroic clients may be few and far between for Tony Serra, but according to his 
colleagues, Serra himself is of heroic stature. Defense lawyers do not require 
righteous defendants; they fight on behalf of legal principles, not people. As 
Serra once remarked, "Whether or not our clients did it is irrelevant. During a 
trial, we are building an ideological castle based on precedent and symbolic 
justice." Still, it seems that Serra only soars to his grandest heights in a 
courtroom when he is championing a client worthy of such heroism. Serra was 
convinced that Patrick "Hooty" Croy was indeed that type of client. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT MADE HOOTY Croy worthy in his attorney's mind was not so much his 
innocence as his symbolic value as an aggrieved Indian, a link in the human 
chain of suffering that stretched back to the last century. So the heart of 
Serra's case was what he called a "cultural defense," a parade of Indian 
scholars, activists and residents of Siskyou County who testified that pioneer 
brutality did not die out in Northern California with the last Indian campaign, 
the bloody Modoc war of the 1870s (which ended with the tribe's 
near-obliteration and the execution of its leaders, whose heads were then 
shipped to the Smithsonian for "scientific investigation"). Indian-hating was 
alive and well in the Yreka area, according to these witnesses, and Croy and 
his family had felt its full lash. It was in the local newspaper, which ran 
racist articles and cartoons, they charged; it was in the schools, where Croy 
was beaten by white students and teachers; and it was in the police and 
sheriff's departments, which regularly harassed the Indian population. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Edward Stern, a white-bearded man with a serious, rabbinical air, would 
periodically admonish Serra that "this is not a classroom." Nonetheless, Stern 
allowed this remarkable, sweeping indictment of the pioneer mentality to 
stretch over three weeks, because, he told the jury, these tales of blood and 
tears were relevant if they had "seeped into the consciousness" of the 
defendant and affected his state of mind at Rocky Gulch that night. 
</P>
<P>
The canvas Serra was permitted to work on was as vast and full of emotion as 
Picasso's "Guernica." After this grand line of defense, Croy himself proved to 
be something of an anticlimax when he finally took the stand. A short, 
powerfully built man with long, braided hair, a mustache and hard, wary eyes, 
he did give off "a vibration you can't escape," in Serra's words. But he was 
not the eloquent "secret resource" his attorney had predicted he would be. Much 
of Croy's testimony covered the same ground as earlier witnesses, and he 
sometimes responded during cross-examination as if he was reading a prepared 
statement. Prosecutor Gary Rossi forced him to recount at such length the 
impressive amount of liquor and marijuana he had consumed that fateful weekend 
that Croy seemed on the verge of being turned into the drunken Indian 
stereotype. Only when he described what it felt like to be in the bull's-eye of 
the posse did Croy's words have the same power as those of the cultural-defense 
witnesses. "I realized that all the things my grandmother and father had told 
us were coming true," he said in a quavering voice, "that they were going to 
kill us all." 
</P>
<P>
Croy's performance was neither as commanding as Serra hoped it would be nor as 
damaging as the prosecution tried to make it. As the long trial drew to its 
close in April, it seemed that victory for Serra would depend less on his 
client's courtroom "vibrations" than on the attorney's ability to indict Yreka 
as a racist community. If the jury -- a San Francisco rainbow of whites, 
Asians, Hispanics and blacks -- bought his argument that Indians in Mount 
Shasta territory continue to be an endangered species, or at least had been 
during the period when the shooting occurred, then Serra had a good chance of 
freeing his client from Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
Serra would have had a tough time selling his cultural defense to an all-white 
Yreka jury. "The prejudice charge is a bunch of b.s.," says Rollie Elsea, a 
Yreka snowmobile dealer who used to race stock cars with Bo Hittson. "The only 
hatred here is for those Indians who were involved in the shooting -- and there 
is definitely hatred there." Edgar Foss, the former owner and editor of the 
Siskiyou Daily News and now a political columnist for the paper, agrees: "It's 
not true that the area is particularly redneck. Our county sheriff, Charlie 
Byrd, is the first elected black sheriff in California." Hittson's sister, 
Terry Villani, is particularly outraged by the racism charge. "This area is not 
a bloody battleground anymore -- it's not the 1800s," she says. "My high school 
boyfriend was an Indian, and Bo supported that. He always got along with 
Indians. The incident that night didn't happen because of racial pressures 
building up in the community. Sure, I've seen problems, but I've also seen 
problems with Indians and alcohol -- the whole evening stemmed from that." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Rossi considered putting Villani on the stand during the rebuttal 
phase of the trial to counter Serra's cultural defense. But the witness he 
suddenly produced was even more effective: Sheriff Charlie Byrd -- big, 
ebony-skinned, with an impressive air of authority. No, Sheriff Byrd assured 
the jury, he had never been on the butt end of racial prejudice -- and he had 
spent his entire life in Siskiyou County. He was born and reared in Weed, not 
far from Yreka, and had served as Weed's police chief before being elected 
sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Serra had been digging beneath the idyllic surface of Yreka, this 
quiet, piney town whose motto is "The Old Days Were Never Better," to show the 
jury the darker currents that supposedly ran through the community. The picture 
he had drawn was as menacing as David Lynch's in "Twin Peaks." But now, this 
one last-inning witness for the prosecution seemed on the verge of undoing it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Then Serra began his cross-examination. His approach was firm but respectful. 
You don't use a hammer on a witness who has moral stature with the jury, he 
knows -- you use a scalpel. Serra tried to get Byrd to agree that he had 
enjoyed a "unique" status in the predominantly white county, but the sheriff 
would not comply. So the attorney led Byrd exactly where he wanted him to go. 
</P>
<P>
Question: How many black families lived in Yreka before 1978? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: One family. 
</P>
<P>
Question: How many blacks were there on the Weed police force when you first 
joined up? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: None. 
</P>
<P>
Question: When you became chief of police, how many blacks were on the force? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: None. 
</P>
<P>
Then Serra completed the circle: 
</P>
<P>
Question: And you don't regard yourself as unique? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. 
</P>
<P>
But the climax came when Serra confronted the witness, this man who had never 
experienced racial prejudice in Siskiyou County, with an unpleasant incident 
from his past. He reminded Byrd of that day years ago when the 19-year-old 
black man had himself fallen afoul of the white man's law. Byrd had been 
arrested for resisting arrest by a white cop in Weed. 
</P>
<P>
Question: But you didn't resist arrest, did you? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. 
</P>
<P>
Question: And you went to court and won, you were found not guilty, isn't that 
right? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
It was a skillful piece of surgery, and when Serra was finished, the questions 
that he had raised about race relations in Siskiyou County throughout the long 
trial still hovered in front of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 12 jurors were released at long last to reach their verdict, they 
were treated to one final aria from the full-throated attorney. In his closing 
argument, Serra flung his arm like a spear in the direction of opposing counsel 
and accused Rossi, a death-penalty specialist who had been hired by Siskiyou 
County to try the case, of being a cold-blooded mercenary. "And no one," 
shouted Serra like a man possessed, "has ever looked into the mouth of a 
mercenary for the truth!" Later, Serra produced a long-stemmed white flower to 
symbolize the pristine harmony of nature and Indian civilization in Northern 
California before the Gold Rush; then he plucked it bare, one petal at a time, 
to show how the white man had ruined it all. Finally, he implored the jurors to 
make history, and yes, fulfill their spiritual mission, by setting Hooty Croy 
free. America's native peoples have been waiting 150 years for justice, he told 
them. Set Hooty Croy free and "like a smoke signal, the word will spread to 
Indians all over the country that the courts can be trusted, that they will be 
treated with dignity, that the white man has not continued to break his word, 
that justice will be done." And then the jury was gone. 
</P>
<P>
They deliberated one full week, then a second. Croy's spirits began to sink, as 
did Serra's. The defense team, which included co-counsels Jasper Monti and 
Diana Samuelson, had felt certain that the jury was touched with the power and 
meaning of the case, that they would come rushing back with a clean victory in 
two days. But it began to look as if their sweeping cultural defense had not 
washed over all the walls of skepticism. "The jurors had a chance to make 
history, but they were quibbling over legal details," thought Serra. "It hurt 
my feelings." Reporters who had covered the trial began to wonder aloud whether 
Serra's impassioned law was too out of style, whether any lawyer in this 
conservative era could successfully defend a man charged with gunning down a 
cop. 
</P>
<P>
Until the very end, the 12 men and women of the jury did not reveal whether or 
not Serra's emotional appeal had worked, whether or not they had been swept up 
in his cause. They would not look into his or Croy's eyes when they finally 
filed back into the courtroom on May Day. Then the verdict was read aloud: Not 
guilty on all counts. Co-counsel Samuelson broke down in tears. Croy began to 
give a statement to the microphones and cameras that suddenly surrounded him, 
but he too could not choke back the surge of emotion. Serra ran after the 
jurors as they left the room. "You did the right thing, and we love you!" he 
shouted to them. One juror later told Serra that the jury members had decided 
early on that there were two "outstanding" figures in the courtroom: Serra and 
Judge Stern. Some jurors had been put off by Serra's more theatrical gestures 
-- one mentioned the plucked flower in particular -- but in the end, they had 
decided to place their trust in this attorney whose soulful oratory seemed less 
a device than a heartfelt expression of belief in his client. 
</P>
<P>
Croy was not yet a free man because the 1985 Supreme Court decision had not 
reversed a conspiracy conviction against him. But he would be by the end of the 
month, when he was freed on his own recognizance to await his resentencing 
hearing on the conspiracy charge. Meanwhile, after a weekend of catching up on 
lost sleep, Serra was due back in court on another case. "I'm a warrior, so I 
go right back into the next battle, that's what I do," he said the day after 
the Croy verdict. There was no time to relish his dazzling win, this climactic 
moment of his legal career. Next week, his routine caseload called. "I've got a 
court date in Orange County on Monday. It's a drug thing. Speed." This week, 
though, Serra had reversed American history; this time the Indians had ridden 
to victory.

SIMON FINALLY BREAKS THE SILENCE; 
</P>
<P>
IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW IN MORE THAN A DECADE, NORTON SIMON SAYS HE DOESN'T 
INTEND TO SELL HIS ART COLLECTION OR TO MERGE HIS PASADENA MUSEUM WITH THE 
GETTY 
</P>

<P>
The fate of Norton Simon's art collection is the most brightly burning issue in 
Southern California's art scene. Will his $750-million collection of European 
and Asian art stay in Pasadena in the building that bears his name? Will the 
museum merge with the J. Paul Getty Museum? Will Simon donate the collection to 
other museums? Or will he sell the whole thing in the art auction of the 
century? 
</P>
<P>
All of these possibilities flare up at one time or another, ignited by Simon 
himself or by yet another rumor. A consummate businessman with a quixotic 
personality, Simon wouldn't be Simon if he weren't negotiating with someone 
somewhere. He has been courted by dozens of museums and several cities during 
35 years of collecting, and he has dashed the hopes of as many suitors. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, his close ties to the J. Paul Getty Museum and a short-lived 
offer in 1987 to donate his collection to UCLA have fueled speculation that 
Simon -- who is 83 and disabled by a neurological disorder called Guillain 
Barre -- is seeking another museum to take charge of his vast collection. 
Meanwhile, a wildly escalating art market has sparked fear that Simon might 
decide to cash in at auction. Roughly valued at $750 million, his collection of 
about 12,000 artworks might bring close to $1 billion if shrewdly marketed at a 
peak moment. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are enormous for Los Angeles, which has lost great collections in 
the past and is only now shaping up as what is seriously considered a 
"world-class art center." Simon's collection represents more than 2,000 years 
of European and Asian art, while boasting such masterpieces as Raphael's 
"Madonna and Child With a Book," Lucas Cranach's "Adam" and "Eve," Francisco de 
Zurbaran's "Still Life With Lemons, Oranges and a Rose" and Rembrandt van 
Rijn's "Portrait of the Artist's Son, Titus." 
</P>
<P>
Among the collection's strengths are distinguished paintings by pre-Renaissance 
and Renaissance artists, Old Masters, Impressionists and Post-Impressionists; 
an extensive assembly of South Asian sculpture; monumental bronzes by Auguste 
Rodin and Henry Moore; bronze modeles of ballet dancers and related works on 
paper by Edgar Degas; major suites of prints by Rembrandt, Francisco Goya and 
Pablo Picasso, and the Galka Scheyer collection of art by the Blue Four group. 
</P>
<P>
No less an authority than John Walsh, director of the J. Paul Getty Museum, 
calls Simon "the best collector of our time." Simon is widely credited with 
assembling the finest art collection in the country after World War II and with 
owning the most distinguished group of European paintings west of Chicago. Even 
those who have bitterly criticized Simon's 1974 takeover of the Pasadena Art 
Museum concede that his collection has added luster to Southern California's 
cultural life. To disturb such a great good thing could be troubling; to lose 
it would be a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
So far this drama has been played out in the press while Simon has maintained a 
conspicuous silence. But now he has revealed his intentions -- insofar as a 
fiercely independent, consistently unpredictable man is willing or able. In his 
first extensive interview in more than a decade, Simon talked at length about 
his plans for the museum and his life as a collector. The four-hour interview 
touched on a wide range of issues. (See Page 93.) 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to keep the museum as it is, but we should be open-minded about it," 
Simon said, making an initial, equivocal pass at dealing with a query about the 
fate of his collection. But as the conversation evolved, he returned to that 
issue repeatedly, each time taking a little more steam out of rumors and 
building confidence that he is putting his energy into keeping the museum right 
where it is, under Simon-designed management. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty is out of the picture for now, he said, although the two museums have 
a close relationship. They have jointly purchased important artworks by Edgar 
Degas and Nicholas Poussin; Simon's wife, Jennifer Jones Simon, serves on the 
Getty's board of trustees, and Harold Williams, head of the J. Paul Getty 
Trust, is a longtime Simon associate. 
</P>
<P>
"Harold Williams worked for me for a long time and we got to know each other 
very well. We have had talks to see how they (the two museums) would fit. But 
at this time, there is no desire on my part or on the part of the Getty to 
merge. We have not found a basis for merging that would make sense to both the 
Getty and ourselves," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our desire is to keep going on our own, if we can, and we really think we can. 
I have a lot of faith in my wife, my board and our people, and the people of 
the United States who have supported the museum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for selling his collection, Simon revealed that he had given the idea 
serious consideration. "For awhile I thought it might be better to get the 
dollars and put them into your foundation," he remarked to his wife, who joined 
him in the interview in their bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"But you didn't, and I'm glad you didn't," said Jennifer Jones Simon, a former 
actress whose foundation benefits mental health programs. "You have put so much 
passion and love and energy into your collection, selling it or giving it up 
would be too sad." While Norton Simon's philosophical bent rules out nothing, 
his wife stated that the collection absolutely will not go on the auction 
block. A Simon associate who requested anonymity concurred, saying, "That will 
never happen." 
</P>
<P>
How large an endowment would be required to maintain the museum in perpetuity? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Simon said, with the exasperated air of a man who knows, right 
down to the last penny, but isn't about to tell the press. The museum's 
operating budget for the 1988-1989 fiscal year was about $2 million, according 
to official tax records. Revenue, also totaling about $2 million, included 
$779,762 from dividends and interest from securities, $457,463 in contributions 
and grants, and $312,404 in museum admission and tour fees. 
</P>
<P>
The building, listed on tax forms as a $3.2-million asset (depreciated from 
$5.7 million), is owned by the board of trustees, and stands on land leased 
from the City of Pasadena for $1 a year. The 75-year lease runs out in 2050, 
but Simon said the city is eager to keep the museum and has even offered to 
donate the property. 
</P>
<P>
Some sources have suggested that a $20-million endowment might be sufficient to 
maintain the museum. Others speculate that it might take twice that, but 
long-range projections can be tricky. Museums that once appeared to be 
generously endowed, such as the Huntington Library in San Marino, have been 
overwhelmed by inflation. The Simon museum has a significant source of income, 
however, in a six-acre property adjacent to the museum site. 
</P>
<P>
"We could sell the property or develop it," Simon said. Automobile agencies 
currently lease a sprawling, one-story building on the land at the corner of 
St. John Avenue and Colorado Boulevard, but Simon envisions a multistory 
structure that would incorporate parking and upper-floor office space for the 
museum with lower floors rented. He also has in mind an attractive complex that 
would include a luxuriant sculpture garden contiguous with the museum grounds. 
"I'm not talking about the tallest building in Los Angeles," he said, but he is 
looking for maximum income. One proposal for a two-story complex was rejected 
because it was too modest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
These arrangements, which are only in talking stages, are necessary for the 
future care and feeding of a collection that Simon has built with great flair. 
Simon has collected art so long and so energetically that it's easy to forget 
that he wasn't born to the job or even conventionally trained for it. His 
actual development is a quite different story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Born for Business 
</P>
<P>
Norton Winfred Simon was born on Feb. 5, 1907, in Portland, Ore., and spent his 
teen-age years in San Francisco. Endowed with a photographic memory and the 
ability to calculate figures in his head at lightning speed, he was a natural 
at business and attended college for only six weeks. One of the most frequently 
told stories about Simon's youthful financial skills is that he put $3,000 into 
the stock market and emerged from the crash of 1929 with $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1931 he made a critical move that would lead to his Hunt Foods &amp; 
Industries empire, the major source of his wealth. Investing $7,000 in a 
bankrupt orange juice bottling plant in Fullerton, Simon parlayed it into a 
wildly successful venture. Within 10 years, sales rose from $43,000 to $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Simon began buying stock in Hunt Brothers Packing Co. in San Francisco in 1941. 
Two years later he sold his company to Hunt for $3 million and used the money 
to increase his Hunt holdings until he owned 25% of the stock. Once he gained 
control of the company, he honed it into an efficient operation. By 1946, Hunt 
sales had risen from $14.5 million to $48.4 million. Sales soared to $102.5 
million by 1956 and to $523.6 million in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
He followed this pattern throughout the most intense period of his 
business-oriented life. Scouting for poorly managed companies whose stock was 
undervalued, he would quietly buy shares of stock until he had a large enough 
portion to demand a place on the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Simon had earned his title as a self-made titan of American corporate business 
and industry, and he would earn a similar title when he turned his energies to 
art in the mid-1950s. "I don't think I was very interested in art until we 
moved into a new home and a decorator started bringing pictures into the 
house," he recalled. He didn't like the pictures, so he went to galleries in 
Los Angeles and New York and soon bought three paintings -- by Pierre Bonnard, 
Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Gauguin. 
</P>
<P>
How did he decide what to buy? 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of business experience. I knew a few questions to ask and I read a 
lot. The fact that I started rather late in life may have been a help because 
of the broad knowledge I got in living," he said. Though he has served on the 
boards of Reed College and UCLA and supported educational programs, Simon has 
little patience with the hidebound aspects of academia. He wouldn't trade what 
he calls his "life experience and business experience" for the "academic 
experience" of most people in the museum field. 
</P>
<P>
Simon was a novice in the halls of art, but not for long. Now acclaimed for 
having a great eye and well known for picking the best brains but making his 
own decisions, Simon began to seek advice from art historians and to devour art 
books. His first decade of collecting was relatively quiet, but his business 
moves were characteristically shrewd. Setting a pattern that holds to this day, 
he established the first of several tax-exempt foundations to buy art for 
public display. He didn't have a museum, so he created a "museum without walls" 
that loaned works from the foundation's collection. 
</P>
<P>
In a stunning move in 1964, still talked about in art circles, Simon bought the 
entire inventory of Duveen Brothers Inc. in New York for $15 million. The sale 
included 146 Old Master paintings and sculpture, porcelain, tapestries and 
furniture assembled by legendary dealer Joseph Duveen, plus a 12,000-volume art 
library. 
</P>
<P>
In another coup, the following year, he purchased "Titus," Rembrandt's portrait 
of his son, for $2.2 million at Christie's London. The sale was big news 
because the price was second only to the $2.3 million paid in 1961 by the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art for another Rembrandt, "Aristotle Contemplating the 
Bust of Homer." But the more interesting story -- and one that has become a 
favorite art world anecdote -- is that Simon almost got aced out of the sale by 
his own secretive style. 
</P>
<P>
He had submitted a letter to the auction house, directing that he would be 
bidding on "Titus" as long as he was sitting down. If he stood up, he had 
stopped bidding. The auctioneer apparently misunderstood and sold the painting 
to Marlborough Fine Arts for $2.18 million. Simon reportedly shouted that he 
had not finished bidding and brandished a copy of his letter. After the 
confusion died down, the auctioneer reopened the sale and Simon made his 
winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's purchases have made the news since the mid-'60s. He bought an Edgar 
Degas gouache and pastel, "Repetition de Ballet" in 1965 for a reportedly 
"breathtaking" $410,000. In a highly publicized London auction of the Robert 
von Hirsch collection, in 1978, Simon paid $923,500 -- the auction's top price 
-- for "The Branchini Madonna," the central panel of an altarpiece by 
15th-Century Italian master Giovanni di Paolo. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's foundations have spent millions of dollars a year on art for the museum 
and Simon has made tax-deductible contributions of art to the foundations. In 
1976, one foundation spent $1.7 million on art and received $5.6 million in 
gifts of art from Simon. The following year, the foundation bought $5 million 
worth of art and Simon donated $3.3 million worth. 
</P>
<P>
While earning a reputation as one of the world's major acquisitors, Simon has 
also sold enough art to stock an entire museum. A 1973 auction of 47 
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works, for example, brought a total of 
$6.8 million, a record for a painting auction at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Constantly revising, reshaping and upgrading his collection, Simon has 
consistently sold art at a profit. In 1980, one of Simon's foundations sold 
$5.3 million worth of art, $3.8 million more than its total purchase price. In 
1982, the foundation unloaded $15 million worth, at a gain of $11.4 million. 
Simon has sold at auction, to dealers and to such private clients as Ivan 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, who in 1979 bought a sculpture by Aristide Maillol for $350,000. The 
piece cost Simon $90,000 in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"He buys low and sells dear, something we all try to do," said J. Carter Brown, 
director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Does Simon regret any of these sales? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to look at what I did with the money to answer that. I usually sold 
to buy something else, and you have to measure what you get against what you 
paid for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Library for Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
While all this commerce was going on, Simon became a cultural patriarch in Los 
Angeles and Fullerton, the home of Hunt Food &amp; Industries. He built a 
$485,000 library on Hunt land and, in 1962, donated it to the City of 
Fullerton. Simon stocked the library with paintings and outdoor sculpture, and 
donated a $5,800 collection of art books the following year. Hoping to extend 
the complex, he approached the Fullerton City Council in the spring of 1964 
with an offer to donate at least $500,000 for a museum. The city agreed to 
donate land just east of the library for the museum, but the plan broke down 
because of inadequate parking. 
</P>
<P>
Simon suggested using a parcel of nearby Fullerton Elementary School District 
property for parking and offered to advance funds to buy land for an exchange. 
He also purchased a dozen houses and cleared land for an entrance to the 
museum, but the project got bogged down in negotiations for the proposed land 
swap. After 2 1/2 years of delays, Simon withdrew his museum offer and said he 
would spend the money he had set aside for the museum to acquire artworks. 
Other Orange County cities indicated that they might be more appreciative of 
Simon's efforts, but he stuck to his new plan, spending $2.4 million on art in 
1967 and $4.7 million in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
By 1969 he had withdrawn from Hunt management and moved his offices to Los 
Angeles, where he was already deeply involved with the County Museum of Art. As 
early as 1957 he had worked with Richard F. Brown, then curator of art at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science and Art in Exposition Park, to 
separate art from that complex and build a new museum for art. LACMA opened in 
1965 on Wilshire Boulevard with Brown as director and a marble plaque stating 
that he and Simon were responsible for the conception of the museum. The 
inaugural display included about $32 million worth of art; 100 works valued at 
$15 million were on loan from Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Many cultural mavens hoped -- even assumed -- that Simon's art would eventually 
belong to the county museum. A Time magazine cover story on Simon, shortly 
after he bought Rembrandt's "Titus," said that LACMA would be the painting's 
"permanent home." The painting was exhibited there, in what amounted to a media 
event, but it now holds a commanding position in Pasadena. Simon's relationship 
with the county museum soured, reportedly over conflicts with other board 
members, quarrels about the museum's architecture and competition among major 
donors. Today Simon recalls a museum with "too many bosses" who failed to give 
Brown "enough authority" to do a good job. Brown resigned and became director 
of the Kimball Art Museum in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
Simon removed some of his art from the museum in 1965, then loaned two groups 
of work in 1968 in a move that was viewed as a rapprochement. Getting the Simon 
collection "would be the greatest thing that ever happened to the museum and to 
Los Angeles," LACMA director Kenneth Donahue said at the time. But it wasn't to 
be. Simon resigned from the board in 1971 and established his own museum three 
years later. In the interim, he loaned large groups of art to Princeton 
University, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and other museums -- all of 
which entertained hopes of Simon gifts. 
</P>
<P>
This was a turbulent period in Simon's life, rocked by the suicide, in 1969, of 
his 31-year-old son, Robert Ellis Simon. Simon lost a race for the U.S. Senate 
to Republican Sen. George Murphy in 1970, after staging a $2-million campaign 
for a capitalistic approach to government. Later that year he was divorced from 
Lucille Ellis Simon, his wife of 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1971, a mutual friend set up a blind date between Simon and 
Jennifer Jones. They were married a month later. The pair shared an interest in 
social causes. Jennifer Jones Simon had no formal art background, but she is 
credited with initiating Norton Simon's pursuit of Asian art and she has played 
star roles in auctions. In one classic mix-up she bid against a mysterious man 
on a telephone who turned out to be her husband. They discovered their mistake 
in time to drop out of the competition. There was no such confusion in a 1980 
auction in London, when she bid more than $3 million for "Resurrection of 
Christ" by 15th-Century Flemish master Dieric Bouts and he took over by 
telephone, finally snagging the painting for $4.25 million. Jennifer Jones 
Simon now serves as president of the museum, a post that Simon resigned last 
year when his health took a turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confined to a Wheelchair 
</P>
<P>
Now confined to a wheelchair, Simon still directs a museum that was born amid 
raging controversy. He was first approached for financial assistance in 1971 by 
trustees of the Pasadena Art Museum, which had opened in 1969 to great critical 
success but was already deeply in debt. Various bail-out proposals were 
discussed, but they didn't reach an agreement until 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Simon finally proposed a five-year plan that was accepted. He took over an 
$850,000 loan on the building and other financial obligations, including a $1 
million accumulated operating deficit, in return for using 75% of the gallery 
space for his collection. The remainder was used to display the Pasadena 
museum's contemporary collection. A new 10-member board of trustees was formed, 
consisting of four members from Simon's group, three from the Pasadena museum 
board and three public members nominated by Simon. 
</P>
<P>
He gained a home for his collection in a climate of increasing acrimony. 
Supporters of the failed museum, some of whom had donated artworks and didn't 
want them to go to Simon, viewed him as a villainous savior. He kept his 
promise to show contemporary art for five years, but it became increasingly 
clear that the man who paid the bills was in charge. If any doubt remained, it 
disappeared in 1978 when he changed the museum's name to the Norton Simon 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The holdover board members, Robert Rowan, Alfred Esberg and Gifford Phillips, 
resigned that year, saying they were concerned about the collection and Simon's 
refusal to loan contemporary works. Discovering that he intended to sell some 
contemporary pieces at auction in 1980, the former trustees brought a civil 
suit against the museum. They charged Simon with cannibalizing the permanent 
collection and manipulating the museum's assets for personal gain. He countered 
that the trustees had been irresponsible managers, noting that he had renovated 
the museum to the tune of $3.75 million, wiped out its debts and devoted more 
than 25% of museum space to contemporary art for the promised five years. 
</P>
<P>
Simon was absolved of impropriety in handling museum's collection in 1981, but 
only after the case had rekindled old resentments. Apparently stung by the 
litigation and negative publicity, he called Dianne Feinstein, then mayor of 
San Francisco, and raised the possibility of moving his collection there. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein threw a dinner party for the Simons and flew to Pasadena for 
meetings. San Franciscans, thrilled with the news, tried to imagine where the 
collection would go and how the city could afford to maintain it. Meanwhile, 
Southern Californians were dismayed to learn that they might lose a second 
museum and a great collection. The affair turned out to be a summer sideshow 
that fizzled out in a few months, but Simon had made his point. 
</P>
<P>
All was reasonably quiet on the Simon front until rumors of a Getty buy-out or 
merger began to fly. Then, on Feb. 20, 1987, UCLA announced an "agreement in 
principle" for Simon to give his collection to the university. The plan was to 
keep most of collection in Pasadena, administered by UCLA, the Simon board and 
the Norton Simon Foundation. The university was to build a separate museum 
facility on campus for part of the collection. But the announcement turned out 
to be premature. Negotiations were far from complete, and Simon withdrew his 
offer three months after the announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
Every move Simon makes sends up a flare in the art world. Two summers ago his 
unexpected long-term loan of contemporary art to the County Museum of Art and 
the Museum of Contemporary Art raised questions about gifts of the work. Would 
he donate the art to an appropriate museum? "That's possible, if I could figure 
out who the stars of today are," he said. And if he could name the stars, would 
he give them away? "No, I would keep the stars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a reflective moment, Simon seems content to leave things as they are and 
enjoy his collection, which he fondly discusses in detail. He isn't buying art 
now because the market is too "unsettled." Besides, he said, "We have so many 
exceptional pictures. The question is, how far do you go?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Simon's Perspective 
</P>
<P>
While Norton Simon focuses much of his attention on his collection and museum 
in this interview, his thoughts go much further afield. An opinionated observer 
of the art scene at large, he aired his views on a variety of issues during a 
four-hour interview. 
</P>
<P>
 On censorship: "You have to keep in touch with your society. Otherwise, you 
don't know who your dictators will be," Simon said in commenting on the 
controversy over federal funding of art that some consider offensive. Art has 
dealt with sexual subjects for centuries, and fig leaves have gone on and off 
with the winds of morality, he noted. He added that legislation isn't the 
answer. "Censorship should be in the eye of the beholder." 
</P>
<P>
On traveling shows: They're bad for art, in Simon's opinion. He loaned large 
groups of works from his collection in the '60s and early '70s, but now he 
rarely lets any of his treasures out of his museum -- particularly the fragile 
Old Masters. This policy is often criticized, but Simon believes he's doing the 
right thing for his collection. Some works have been damaged while on loan and 
in transit. "Old Masters shouldn't be moved and banged up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the art market: "It's unsettled and it will probably stay that way for 
awhile because of exposure" in the media, he said. But there are still good 
buys. "If I were starting over I would try Indian or Southeast Asian art. I 
think it has been overlooked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On contemporary art: "There are painters who are damn good and painters who are 
damn bad, as it has always been, and there are a lot of them in the middle. 
There's nothing to say that this isn't a high point in American painting." 
</P>
<P>
On looking at art: "The best way to get to know a painting and love a painting 
is through frequent, casual contact." 
</P>
<P>
On national treasures: "The United States will have to develop policies more in 
line with those of European countries if it wants to prevent a flow of art out 
of the country." 
</P>
<P>
On the Rembrandt Research Group: "I think they are very arrogant," he said of 
the Amsterdam-based team that recently concluded his Rembrandt self-portrait is 
actually the work of the Dutch master's highly accomplished student, Carel 
Fabritius. "I can't find any American scholars who agree with them. I've had 
15, 18 or 20 people look at the self-portrait, so I feel pretty secure on it. 
If it is a Fabritius, it's a very good one," he said.
